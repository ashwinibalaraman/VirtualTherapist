That the aging process is, fundamentally, "normal" is one of the undeniable
facts of human life. Yet the definition of <i>normal aging</i> is far less clear. In this
chapter, I will describe a set of physical and cognitive changes in later
adulthood that are considered to be the result of the normal aging process.
Although it is true that as individuals age, they are at greater risk of developing
chronic health problems such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and
sensory impairments, these conditions are not inherent in the aging process.
This distinction between normal aging and disease is important for mental
health providers to be able to recognize for the purposes of both diagnosis and
treatment. Symptoms of depression and anxiety related to the presence of
disease may be lifted when the underlying disease is treated. Normal age-related
changes may also contribute to psychological distress, and even though
these changes may not be reversible, compensatory measures can be taken to
improve the individual's emotional well-being.


Relevant to these points is that fact that there are wide individual differences
in reactions to aging as well as differences in the rates of aging. Many effects

[p. <i>4</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00010&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Personality and self-concept clearly play interactive roles in understanding
physical and cognitive aging processes (Whitbourne, 1987). It is useful to
conceptualize the individual's reaction to aging in terms of the meaning that
specific age-related changes have for sense of competence, mastery, and sense of
the self as continuous over time as well as the ability to adapt to the environment.
For certain individuals, changes in particular aspects of functioning may prove
extremely threatening to identity because these changes involve loss of particularly
valued abilities or characteristics. Individuals may react defensively to these
changes, either pretending that they have not in fact occurred or attempting to
overcompensate by engaging in a series of desperate measures to prevent any
further deterioration. Other age-related changes not as central to identity may be
perceived and reacted to in a more neutral, dispassionate manner. In developing
therapeutic interventions, it is essential to understand the meaning of a particular
age-related change for the individual in terms of lifelong patterns of activity,
behavior, interests, and personality. Within this context, suggestions can be made
to help the individual by adapting coping strategies and other cognitive interventions
for reducing stress (Folkman, Lazarus, Gruen, &amp; DeLongis, 1986; Lazarus
&amp; Folkman, 1984). For example, the individual can be helped to compensate for
certain changes using a variety of problem-focused coping strategies, such as
planful problem solving. If the availability of compensatory measures is limited,
the clinician can help the individual accommodate to these changes through, for
example, positive reappraisal and other emotion-focused forms of coping. In this
chapter, I will outline the major physical and cognitive changes associated with
the aging process and present suggestions for compensatory measures that can be
incorporated into such intervention strategies for older adult clients.


<b>Normal Age-Related Changes
in Physical Functioning</b>


The physiological changes associated with the aging process occur as the
result of an inexorable process that moves the individual ultimately toward
death. The cause of aging is not yet known, and there are many theories that

[p. <i>5</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00011&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

APPEARANCE


The signs of aging are most apparent in the aging of the individual's
appearance. Contributing to the aging of appearance are changes in the skin,
hair, facial structures, and body build. For the most part, the effect of these
changes is cosmetic; however, there are ramifications of the aging of these
structures for the individual's overall physical functioning.


<i>Skin</i>. The development of creases, discoloration, furrows, sagging, and loss
of resiliency are the most apparent changes in the skin. The processes responsible
for these changes have a negative effect on the skin's protective functions
as well as its appearance. There is less insulation provided against extremes
of temperature and less of a barrier against environmental agents that can
irritate the skin and cause dermatitis (Grove, 1989). Dryness, sagging, and
wrinkling of the skin on the face and body can also lead to discomfort
(Kligman, 1989). There are also alterations in the immune responsiveness of
the skin and, along with a diminished blood supply to the skin, the immune
system's response to surface inflammation is reduced (Balin &amp; Pratt, 1989).


<i>Hair</i>. With increasing age in adulthood, for both men and women, the hair on
the head and body loses its pigmentation and becomes white due to decreased
melanin production in the hair follicles. The extent to which a person's hair begins
to appear gray depends on the rate at which colored hairs turn white and the
original hair color into which the white hairs become mixed. For both men and
women, hair on the face becomes coarser and longer, and men may develop long
hairs on the external canal of the ear (Whitbourne, 1986).


<i>Face</i>. Changes in the appearance of the face represent changes already
discussed in the skin and hair as well as changes in the bones of the face

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Body Build</i>. It is well established that over the course of adulthood, there is
a consistent pattern of a reduction in standing height, occurring at a greater
rate after the 50s and particularly pronounced in women (Adams, Davies, &amp;
Sweetname, 1970; Shephard, 1978). Not only is there a height decrease, but
there are changes in the overall shape of the body due to altered distribution
of body fat starting in middle age. Based primarily on cross-sectional studies
but also consistent with clinical experience, it is well documented that weight
increases from the 20s until the mid-50s, after which total body weight
declines. Body fat distribution also changes over the course of adulthood, with
subcutaneous fat decreasing in the extremities and increasing in the abdominal
area for both men and women (Shephard, 1978).


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


As the individual's appearance changes in later adulthood, the potential
exists for his or her identity to change in corresponding ways, some of them
negative. Comparisons of present appearance with pictures or memories of
early adulthood can be damaging to self-esteem to people who valued their
youthful image (Fenske &amp; Albers, 1990; Kleinsmith &amp; Perricone, 1989). At
the same time, others may be repulsed by the wrinkles, discolorations, and
white hair of the older person, causing the aged individual to feel rejected and
isolated (Kligman, 1989). These changes involve primarily the face but can
also include changes in exposed areas of the body. With regard to body build,
changes in body fat and muscle tone that lead to the appearance of a sagging
or heavier body shape can result in increased identification of the self as
moving away from the figure of youth. The development of "middle-aged
spread" is one of the first occurrences to trigger recognition of the self as
aging, even before the first gray hairs have become fully evident.


<i>Compensatory Measures</i>


Short of cosmetic surgery, there are many steps that older individuals can
take to slow, compensate for, or correct the changes in appearance caused by
aging of the skin. The primary method of prevention, which must be started

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There are many possible ways for the individual to compensate for age-related
changes in the skin once they have become manifest. To counteract the
fragility, sensitivity, and dryness of the skin, the individual can use sunscreens,
emollients, and fragrance-free cosmetics. As it is traditional for
women to use facial cosmetics, the proper choice of color and coverup
techniques can enhance the individual's appearance (O'Donoghue, 1991).
Changes in body build can be compensated, often remarkably so, by regular
involvement in activities and exercise that maintain muscle tone and reduce
fat deposits under the skin.


MOBILITY


The ability to move about through one's physical surroundings is a function
of the smooth coordination of the body's joints and muscles and the associated
tendons and ligaments. Movement is also made possible by the bones, which
must be both strong and resilient. The normal aging process results in changes
in all these structures, leading to the possibility that the individual will become
limited in the ability to carry out desired movements and actions.


<i>Muscles</i>. There is little reduction in muscle strength until at least age 40 or
50 years, a 10% to 20% decrease thereafter until about age 50 or 60 years, and
a 30% to 40% decrease by the 70s and 80s. Loss of muscle strength is more
pronounced in the legs than the hands and arms (McArdle, Katch, &amp; Katch,
1991).


<i>Bones</i>. The overall pattern of bone development in adulthood is a progressive
loss of bone strength, due primarily to a loss of bone mineral content as the
rate of resorption exceeds that of new bone apposition. The decrease in various
measures of bone strength ranges from 5% to 12% per decade from the 20s
through the 90s (McCalden, McGeough, Barker, &amp; Court-Brown, 1993). In
part, bone density and the loss of bone mass in the later years of adulthood
may be a function of genetic factors (Dargent &amp; Breart, 1993; Kelly et al.,
1993). Lifestyle also seems to play a role, however, including factors such as
physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, and diet, which can account for 50%
to 60% of the variation in bone density (Krall &amp; Dawson-Hughes, 1993).
There are also hormonal influences on bone mass, as indicated by the observation
that bone mineral loss in women proceeds at a higher rate in postmenopausal
women, who are no longer producing estrogen in monthly cycles

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Joints</i>. Age-related losses have been documented to occur in every structural
component of the joints, including the tendons, ligaments, synovial membranes,
synovial fluid, and arterial cartilage (Brooks &amp; Fahey, 1984). Joint
functioning peaks in efficiency in the 20s and decreases continuously thereafter
(Bortz, 1982) with accelerating decreases after the 60s (Bassey, Morgan,
Dallosso, &amp; Ebrahim, 1989; Vandervoort et al., 1992).


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


Degenerative changes in the muscles and joints, whether due to disease or
the normal aging process, have many pervasive effects on the individual's life
and are a major source of disability (Hughes, Cordray, &amp; Spiker, 1984;
Hughes, Edelman, Singer, &amp; Chang, 1993). Restriction of movement in the
upper limbs rules out many enjoyable leisure activities and can make it
difficult for the individual to perform occupations that require finely tuned
motor skills and repetitive movements of the hand and arm. Pain and lack of
flexibility in the legs and feet can slow the individual's pace when walking.
Restricted movement of the hip leads to a number of restrictions, such as
limping, difficulty climbing stairs, and rising from a chair or sofa. Involvement
of the knee adds to these difficulties. Degenerative changes in the spine,
in addition, often result in back pain that, if not restrictive in and of itself, has
the constant potential to detract from the individual's enjoyment of both
occupational and recreational activities. This restriction of activities, combined
with the experience of pain, may lead the individual to suffer from
clinical symptoms of depression (Williamson &amp; Schulz, 1992a). In part, the
effects of mobility loss can be attributed to the enforced reliance on others
that is created, leading to other deleterious processes, such as being treated
like a dependent child (Whitbourne &amp; Wills, 1993).


One of the most deleterious outcomes of reduced muscle strength, bone
strength, and joint mobility is the heightened susceptibility of older individuals,
particularly women, to falls and to serious consequences resulting from
falls (Kelsey &amp; Huffman, 1987; Lord, Clark, &amp; Webster, 1991a). Community
survey estimates of the prevalence of falling range from 32% (Tinetti, Speechley,
&amp; Ginter, 1988) to 42% (Downton &amp; Andrews, 1990) to 53% (Walker &amp;
Allen, 1991). Over 250,000 patients are hospitalized each year in the United
States for treatment of fractured hips (Allegrante, MacKenzie, Robbins, &amp;
Cornell, 1991). There are a number of interacting age-related processes that

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The experience of a fall can lead to a vicious cycle in which one fall leads the
individual to become fearful of more falls, and as a result, to walk less securely
and confidently. This loss of a sense of security can serve to increase the risk that
older persons will lose their balance and actually make them more likely to fall
in the future. The experience of falling can also lead individuals to develop low
self-efficacy about themselves as being unable to avoid a fall, further impairing
their balance and gait (Downton &amp; Andrews, 1990; Tinetti et al., 1990). Apart
from the physical risk factors that increase the likelihood of falling, there exist
psychological variables related to elderly persons' attitudes toward their abilities
and senses of security (Tinetti &amp; Powell, 1993). Even without actual bone
fracture, then, the older adult may experience some of the psychological consequences
associated with lessened mobility. Furthermore, necessary daily activities
that were previously conducted with little concern, such as descending a steep
flight of stairs or walking on icy pavement, may create fear and hence avoidance.
The experience of falling, in this sense, might precipitate rapid realization of aging
regarding the fragility of the bones and lead to a loss of autonomy and sense of
competence.


<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


Counteracting the picture of inevitable decline in muscle strength is evidence,
accruing from the 1970s, showing that a regular program of exercise
can help the middle-aged and older adult compensate substantially for the loss

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONING


Age-related changes in the heart and arteries have the effect of reducing the
amount of blood available to the cells of the body, but under ordinary
conditions, this is not particularly pronounced or noticeable. The effects of
aging of the circulatory system are most apparent when the individual is
engaging in aerobic exercise, when there is a reduction both in maximum
oxygen consumption (aerobic capacity) and the maximum attainable heart
rate (Lakatta, 1987; Morley &amp; Reese, 1989). The decrease in maximum
oxygen consumption occurs in a linear fashion throughout the adult years so
that the average 65-year-old individual has 30% to 40% of the aerobic
capacity of the young adult (McArdle, Katch, &amp; Katch, 1991). Other functional
variables that decrease to a commensurate degree include stroke volume
(the amount of blood pumped at each beat of the heart) (Weisfeldt &amp; Gerstenblith,
1986) and cardiac output per minute (heart rate times the stroke volume).
As a result of these decreases in the functional capacity of the heart, less
oxygen reaches the muscles during exercise, and the individual is more likely
to suffer from temporary ischemia. These functional changes appear to be
attributable to reduced pumping capacity of the heart due to a variety of
changes affecting the structure and function of the heart muscle walls, particularly
in the area of the left ventricle (Kitzman &amp; Edwards, 1990; Weisfeldt
&amp; Gerstenblith, 1986). Changes in the heart and arteries can account, in part,
for the observation that older individuals have higher levels of systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, both at rest and during exercise; however, this is not
a consistent finding and may be confounded by the presence of individuals
with hypertension in the older populations that are tested (Whitbourne, 1986).

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


The adequacy of the cardiovascular system is reflected in the individual's
ability to engage in a range of physical activities, including walking outside,
moving about the house, carrying heavy objects, and engaging in strenuous
exercise. Reductions in the cardiovascular system's functioning therefore
contribute importantly to changes in the structures underlying movement to
reduce, potentially, the individual's mobility in the physical environment. In
addition, although not as apparent in its effects on identity as appearance, the
functioning of the cardiovascular system is an important influence on the individual's
feelings of well-being and identity. All adults know that the efficiency
of the cardiovascular system is essential to life so that threats to the
integrity of this system are perceived as highly dangerous. Awareness of
reduced cardiovascular efficiency can therefore serve as reminders of one's
own personal mortality.


<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


Given the importance of cardiovascular functioning to the overall health
and longevity of the individual, there has been a wealth of research pointing
to the effectiveness of exercise in slowing or reversing the effects of the aging
process on the system (Stamford, 1988). Much of the original research in this
area was conducted in Sweden, due to the popularity of endurance sports, such
as cross-country skiing and long-distance running. Many of the participants
in this early research were lifelong exercisers. With the growth of the fitness
industry in the United States, however, contemporary research includes respondents
with recent interest in aerobic exercise who may constitute a more
representative group than do long-term fitness fanatics.


The major dependent variable in research on the effectiveness of exercise
training is aerobic capacity and, secondarily, maximum attainable heart rate.
The results of research on the effectiveness of exercise training have consistently
revealed improved functioning in long-term endurance athletes, master
athletes who remain active, long-term exercisers, and previously sedentary
adults who enroll in short-term training programs (McArdle, Katch, &amp; Katch,
1991; Whitbourne, 1986). The main advantage that exercise seems to hold as
a means of retaining a higher level of cardiovascular functioning is that it
provides a continued potent stimulus for the muscle cells of the heart to
undergo strong contractions so that they retain or gain contractile power. The
greater strength of the myocardial muscle improves the functioning of the left
ventricle and as a result, more blood can be ejected from the left ventricle
during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle (Ehsani, Ogawa, Miller, Spina,
&amp; Jilka, 1991). The other advantage of exercise training is that it makes it

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In addition to the benefits that exercise training has for the cardiovascular
system, it is well established that adults who become involved in aerobic
activities experience a variety of positive effects on mood, anxiety levels, and
particularly feelings of mastery and control, leading to enhanced feelings of
self-esteem (Hill, Storandt, &amp; Malley, 1993; McAuley, Lox, &amp; Duncan, 1993;
Sidney &amp; Shephard, 1976). Questions remain, however, regarding the causal
linkages in this relationship between exercise and well-being (Brown, 1992).
Although some researchers have demonstrated there to be positive effects of
exercise on cognitive functioning (Chodzko-Zajko, Schuler, Solomon, Heinl,
&amp; Ellis, 1992; Stevenson &amp; Topp, 1990), this effect is not consistently observed
(Hill, Storandt, &amp; Malley, 1993). Nevertheless, the finding is consistently observed
that older adults who enter exercise training programs "feel better,"
and this improvement in mood can be clinically useful for many aging clients.


RESPIRATORY SYSTEM


Structures in the respiratory system are responsible for the process of gas
exchange between the blood and air so that the body's cells receive adequate
support for their metabolic activities. The major effect of aging is to reduce
the quality of gas exchange in the lungs so that less oxygen from the outside
air reaches the blood (Kenney, 1989). There are also age-related reductions
in vital capacity, the amount of air that is moved into and out of the lungs at
maximal levels of exertion (Reddan, 1981).


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


Age changes in respiration can lead to feelings of dyspnea and fatigue
associated with exertion, sensations that can be extremely distressing and have
the potential to arouse panic (McConnell &amp; Davies, 1992). Dyspnea (shortness
of breath) will be more likely to occur at lower degrees of activity than

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


The effects of exercise training on respiratory functioning are encouraging
(Blumenthal et al., 1989), but the specific effects of exercise on respiratory
functioning are not as dramatic as are the effects on the cardiovascular system.
Equally, if not more, beneficial to the respiratory function is the avoidance of
cigarette smoking (Hermanson et al., 1988; Webster &amp; Kadah, 1991).


EXCRETORY SYSTEM


With increasing age in adulthood, the efficiency of the excretory process is
reduced such that the kidneys are generally able to function under normal
conditions but become inefficient when there are wide fluctuations in fluid
levels within the body (Danzinger, Tobin, Becker, Lakatta, &amp; Fleg, 1990).
Reduced functioning of the kidneys in older adults also results in a slower rate
of excreting drugs from the body so that relatively low dosages of medication
can accumulate to toxic levels in the bloodstream (Rowe, 1982). Unless the
dosage is adjusted to take into account this lower rate of tubular transport, the
drugs may have adverse effects instead of their intended benefits (Lamy,
1988; Montgomery, 1990).


The most significant effect of changes with age in the bladder is on patterns of
urinary incontinence. The prevalence of incontinence among the population 60
years and older is estimated to be 19% for women and 8% for men (Herzog,
Diokno, Brown, Normolle, &amp; Brock, 1990) but can reach as high as 36% among
community-dwelling elderly with dementia (Ouslander, Zarit, Orr, &amp; Muira,
1990). Women are more likely to suffer from stress incontinence, which refers to
loss of urine at times of exertion, such as when laughing, sneezing, lifting, or
bending. This condition is the result of weakness of the pelvic muscles. Urge
incontinence is more prevalent in men and involves urine loss following an urge
to void or lack of control over voiding with little or no warning (Diokno, Brock,
Brown, &amp; Herzog, 1986). For men, incontinence is related to prostatic hypertrophy,
prostate disease, or incomplete emptying of the bladder.

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


The aging of the excretory system is unlikely to have a discernible effect
on everyday functioning. However, age-related changes in the bladder can
present significant problems. Such changes can be highly disruptive to the
older individual's everyday life, causing subjective distress and embarrassment
in social situations (Ouslander &amp; Abelson, 1990; Wyman, Harkins, &amp;
Fantl, 1990; Yu, 1987). Fear of becoming incontinent may also increase the
individual's general anxiety about problems in urination, further exacerbating
these difficulties.


<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


The effects of aging on the kidney and the bladder are not amenable to
compensation; though, once identified, behavioral methods have proven
effective for the treatment of incontinence. Techniques ranging from biofeedback
to very simple exercises (such as the "Kegel" exercise in which a woman
contracts and relaxes the pelvic muscles) can hold the problem in check if not
reverse it (Baigis-Smith, Smith, Rose, &amp; Newman, 1989; Burgio &amp; Engel,
1990; Burns et al., 1993). Thus, although the psychological damage is potentially
very high from changes in urinary functioning, this can be offset by the
individual's experience of success in learning new forms of behavioral management.
(See also Chapter 16, this volume.) Prostate symptoms have also
been shown to respond to treatment.


EATING AND DIGESTION


Although a great deal of attention is given by advertisers and the popular media
to the inefficient digestive processes of older adults, the documented effects of
aging are of far less significance. There are numerous gastrointestinal diseases
that interfere with the efficiency of digestion and must be ruled out before
considering the possibility that a particular problem or symptom is the result of
aging. Furthermore, the fact that individuals vary so much in digestive habits
further complicates the analysis of aging effects. There are a host of psychological,
cultural, and economic factors whose cumulative effects on diet over a
lifetime interact with whatever changes are intrinsic to the aging process.


Early investigations in salivary functioning yielded evidence of diminished
secretions by the parotid glands (Kamocka, 1970). These investigations failed
to exclude participants with diagnosed medical problems, however, and they
were based exclusively on cross-sectional data. When healthy individuals
only are studied and are followed over time, there is no diminution reported

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


Changes in the digestive system at the physiological level due to aging are
minimal in terms of their effects on the individual's adaptation. Inaccurate
conceptions communicated through the media, however, may lead older

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Equally serious is the potential for reductions in the quality of the individual's
food intake due to age-related changes in other bodily systems. It is well
established that apart from the disease diabetes mellitus, glucose tolerance is
impaired in older adults (Davidson, 1982). Reductions in mobility make it
more difficult for the older adult to push a shopping cart, carry groceries into
and from a bus or automobile, and reach for items on high shelves in the
supermarket or at home (Wantz &amp; Gay, 1981). Sensory losses may reduce the
individual's ability to read shopping lists, grocery advertisements, and prepare
good-tasting food. Problems with teeth and dentures are another source
of possible loss of eating pleasure and, ultimately, nutritional deficiencies
(Posner, Jette, Smigelski, Miller, &amp; Mitchell, 1994). In the cognitive domain,
memory problems and difficulties processing information can make it more
difficult for the older individual to take the necessary steps for healthy and
satisfying food preparation. Changes in family patterns, particularly the loss
of a spouse, can cause older individuals to lose the incentive to cook, and the
emotional associations to family mealtimes of the past that no longer can take
place may lead to depression and disinterest in eating (Rosenbloom &amp; Whittington,
1993). Men living alone are particularly vulnerable to poor nutrition
(Davis, Murphy, &amp; Neuhaus, 1988; Davis, Randall, Forthofer, Lee, &amp; Margen,
1985). Adverse economic circumstances also can play a major role in
affecting patterns of eating because the individual may be working with such
a limited budget that only the minimal, and perhaps unappetizing, necessities
can be acquired.


<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


The avoidance of bad habits is a crucial compensatory strategy. Perhaps the
greatest obstacle for the individual to overcome in this process is the mountain
of publicity heaped on the adult population by pharmaceutical companies,
warning them of the dangers of not being "regular."


To overcome changes in the context in which food is bought, prepared, and

AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS)


There are discernible effects of aging in important functions that are
controlled by the ANS; two in particular have a considerable effect on the
individual's daily life: bodily temperature control and sleep patterns.


It is well established both through population health statistics and experimental
studies that individuals over the age of 65 years have impaired adaptive
responses to extremely hot and cold environmental temperatures (Phillips,
Bretherton, Johnston, &amp; Gray, 1991; Tankersley, Smolander, Kenney, &amp;
Fortney, 1991). The diminished response of the elderly to cold appears to be
due to diminished feedback that the core body temperature is low and to an
impaired ability to raise core temperatures when the body's peripheral temperature
becomes lowered. Responses to extremes of heat are impaired due to
decreased secretion by the sweat glands in the skin. Paradoxically, some older
adults report feeling cold even when others in the environment feel uncomfortably
warm; this effect does not appear to be linked to normal aging
processes but instead reflects diminished cardiovascular functioning (Whitbourne,
1985).


Older adults spend more time in bed relative to time spent asleep due to
longer time taken to fall asleep, more periods of wakefulness during the night,
and time spent lying awake before arising in the morning. In old age, the
primary causes of sleep disturbance include sleep apnea (Ancoli-Israel &amp;
Kripke, 1991), periodic leg movements, heartburn, and frequent needs to
urinate (Friedman et al., 1992; Whitbourne, 1986; see also Chapter 18, this
volume). Electroencephalograph sleep patterns show some corresponding age
alterations, including a rise in Stage 1 sleep (drowsiness without actual sleep)
and a large decrease in Stage 4 sleep (slow wave or heavy sleep). By the 60s
and 70s, REM sleep starts to diminish as well, as do the observable behaviors
associated with REM sleep (Prinz, Vitiello, Raskind, &amp; Thorpy, 1990).


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


The changes in the regulatory efficiency of the ANS can create another set
of difficulties in a range of everyday activities. The ability to adjust blood

<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


Changes in the ANS occur largely outside the individual's control. The
individual can avoid exacerbating these changes or causing them to become
life threatening or disruptive to flow of ordinary daily activities, however.
With regard to body temperature control, the aging individual needs to be
aware of the fact that perception of temperature extremes (particularly cold)
is likely to be diminished. Careful attention must be given to weather conditions,
particularly wind chill levels in the winter and heat-humidity indexes
in the summer, and the individual should be aware of what precautions will
be needed in these instances.


Altered sleep patterns can also be compensated for by taking steps to avoid
daytime naps and follow good sleep habits. One of the most damaging effects
on sleep is anxiety over insomnia, a condition that might well develop in
individuals who have believed all their lives that 8 hours of sleep is the normal
human need rather than the 7 hours that the average adult actually sleeps. The
longer the time spent in bed awake, the harder it is for the individual to develop
a normal nightly rhythm based on this more realistic sleep requirement. If
these strategies are ineffective, behavioral methods such as stimulus control
can be used (Morin &amp; Azrin, 1988).


REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM


The feelings connected with sexuality, both in terms of reproduction and
the expression of sexual drives, are important contributors to the adult's
overall well-being and form an important component of intimate relationships
with other adults. In addition, the individual's identity may be influenced in
part by his or her self-evaluation of sexual attractiveness, responsiveness, and
capacity to produce offspring.


<i>Female Reproductive System</i>


Throughout her 40s, a woman's reproductive capacity becomes gradually
reduced until, by the age of 50 to 55 years, it ceases altogether. This transitional

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Other changes in sexual functioning occur due to aging of the tissues in other
bodily systems. For example, sagging of the breasts and wrinkling of the skin in
the torso occurs as the result of decreased elasticity of the skin. Subcutaneous fat
accumulates in the torso, especially around the waist, leading to uneven bulges.
These changes add to those in body build, facial structure, and the skin on the
face to alter progressively the woman's appearance in old age.


The appearance and functioning of the genital organs also change after the
menopause (Schiff &amp; Wilson, 1978). The pubic hair on the mons veneris and
around the vulva becomes thin and coarser. The labia majora and minora
become thinner and wrinkled, the skin in the vulva atrophies, and the surface
mucosa of the vaginal wall becomes thin, dry, pale, and smooth. The vagina
also becomes narrower and shorter so that it is less able to accommodate an
inserted penis. These changes are significant not only for their effects on
sexual functioning but for their effects on the woman's enjoyment of sexual
intercourse. The older woman may experience discomfort during prolonged
intercourse due to changes in the vagina and vulva, and the rhythmic contractions
of the uterus may become painful.


Despite changes in the reproductive system, the conclusion reached by
Masters and Johnson nearly 30 years ago is still generally accepted--that
older women are limited in their potential to achieve sexual gratification more
by their attitudes, values, and accessibility to partners than they are by the
physical changes involved in the aging process. The sexual response cycle
might be slowed down somewhat in the older woman, but the possibility of
achieving orgasm is not reduced (Masters &amp; Johnson, 1966). There appears
to be minimal functional impairment in sexual functioning as women age.


<i>Male Reproductive System</i>


Just as women gradually lose reproductive capacity throughout the middle
years of adulthood, men experience a climacteric of sorts in which there is a
gradual reduction in the number of viable sperm they produce due to degenerative
changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. Although men retain
the ability to father children into old age, the reduction of viable sperm results
in a steady decrease of fertilization potential through the later years of
adulthood (Harman, 1978).


With increasing age in adulthood, men may experience changes in the
prostate gland that lead to a reduction of the volume and pressure of semen
expelled during ejaculation. Age-related changes also include overgrowth or

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A physiological index of reproductive function that has a decidedly noticeable
effect on the older man's sense of his own sexuality is that of penile erectility. It
is well documented that older men experience fewer nightly episodes of penile
erections compared to younger males (Karacan, Williams, Thornby, &amp; Salis,
1975). By contrast, there are inconsistencies in the findings regarding an increase
in penile circumference during erection, with some decreases noted across age
groups by some researchers (Solnick &amp; Birren, 1977), and in other research, no
age differences are observed (Schiavi &amp; Schreiner-Engel, 1988).


As is true for aging women, there is a general slowing down in aging men
of the progression through the phases of the human sexual response cycle,
from excitement through resolution. Compared to young adult men, orgasm
is shorter, involving fewer contractions of the prostate and ejection of a
smaller amount of seminal fluid (Masters &amp; Johnson, 1970). These findings
are consistent with the physiological data on changes in the male reproductive
system and carry some negative implications for the aging male's sexual
relations. However, the gains for the older man's ability to enjoy sexuality are
also compelling. He may feel less driven toward the pressure to ejaculate, be
able to prolong the period of sensual enjoyment prior to orgasm, and have the
control to coordinate his pleasure cycle to correspond more to his partner's.


A man's pattern of sexual activity in the earlier years of adulthood is by far
the best predictor of his sexual activity in old age (George &amp; Weiler, 1985).
The sexually active middle-aged man, given good health, has the potential to
remain sexually active well into his later years.


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


The effect of reproductive changes in later adulthood depends heavily on
how the individual interprets the significance of this transition. The menopause
may be met with relief or it may serve as a reminder of the inevitability
of aging and one's own mortality. Age-related changes leading to a slowing
of sexual response may have a negative effect on the individual's enjoyment
of sexual relations. The man may write himself off as a sexual partner,
believing that his masculine prowess has failed. Furthermore, the changes in
sexual functioning may serve as signs that one's body is deteriorating and

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


If the aging individual is distressed about changes in appearance, he or she
can use various strategies, including the creative use of clothing, to disguise
or compensate for them. However, changes in one's sexual appearance that
are visible only to oneself or one's intimate partner may constitute a different
set of challenges. It may be embarrassing for the aging person to seek the
emotional support and reassurance of a partner or same-sex peers about the
changing appearance of the body. On the other hand, as the partners in a
relationship age together, seeing the changes that both undergo as a result of
the aging process may provide a sense of comfort and companionship.


Difficulties in adjusting to age changes in the sexual response cycle may
present a problem if the partners are unfamiliar with the fact that sexual
responsiveness naturally becomes altered in later adulthood. The individual
may worry about loss of orgasmic capacity because it takes longer to become
aroused, excited, and stimulated. Adding to these concerns may be the belief
that it is wrong and unnatural for older people to harbor sexual desires and
that it is inappropriate for them to maintain an interest in sexual relations
(Weg, 1983). If one's partner is infirm, or if one is widowed, the older
individual in current society, raised during a sexually more conservative
period of history, is unlikely to seek other outlets of sexual stimulation such
as masturbation, homosexual partnerships, or liaisons outside the marriage
(Croft, 1982). Increasingly, the individual may come to view himself or
herself as an asexual creature when, in fact, he or she possesses a considerable
reserve of potential sexual enjoyment. Educational programs that inform the
older individual or couple about normal age-related changes in sexual functioning
can help break what would otherwise be a negative cycle of loss of
sexual interest and capacity (Goldman &amp; Carroll, 1990).


CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM


In the nervous system, as in the other major organ systems, changes with
age that are due to disease alone are difficult to separate from changes that are

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Keeping in mind the distinction between normal aging and disease processes,
there is documentation that areas of the brain are differentially affected by
neuronal loss in later adulthood. There appears to be significant loss of neurons
from the hippocampus, the area affected by Alzheimer's disease and involved in
short-term memory (Mouritzen Dam, 1979). There is also significant loss of cells
from the cerebellum (Hall, Miller, &amp; Corsellis, 1975), the structure that regulates
refined motor patterns. Age-related losses in these subcortical areas, however, are
considered relatively minor compared to losses (as high as 50%) in the areas of
the cerebral cortex responsible for processing sensory information, including the
primary visual cortex (Devaney &amp; Johnson, 1980), the primary somatosensory
region (Henderson, Tomlinson, &amp; Gibson, 1980), and the secondary auditory
cortex, which loses between one third to one half of its total number of neurons
over the adult years (Brody, 1955; Henderson, Tomlinson, &amp; Gibson, 1980). Cells
in the motor cortex show comparable losses of between 20% to 50%, and these
losses are thought to be a contributing factor to muscular stiffness, slowness, and
joint pain (Scheibel, 1982). In contrast to these somewhat dramatic losses of
neuron density is the relative stability in the prefrontal region of the cortex
(Higatsberger, Budka, &amp; Bernheimer, 1982; Huttenlocher, 1979). The stability
of neurons in this region of the cortex is important because these are the parts of
the nervous system involved in judgment, abstract thinking, and the ability to
plan. Such patterns map well onto findings of differential loss of cognitive
abilities valued in intelligence.


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


Aging of the central nervous system has direct effects on a variety of
sensory, motor, and cognitive capacities and behaviors. Aging appears to
affect a number of specific functions served by the central nervous system,
including perception, short-term memory, fine motor coordination, and large
muscle control. These changes in the brain contribute a central integrative

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


The view of the aging brain as a degenerating system does not take into
account what is known about the compensatory processes of redundancy and
plasticity. The effect of these processes is most likely to occur in the association
areas of the cerebral cortex, where higher-order abstract thinking processes
are mediated. In fact, these abilities may improve in the later years of
adulthood as individual stores of experiences are incorporated into long-term
memory and on which decisions and judgments are based. As will be discussed
later, by maintaining an active and inquisitive lifestyle through exposure
to stimulating environments, the older individual can optimize the aging
brain's potential for plasticity and compensation


<b>Normal Age-Related Changes
in Sensory Functioning</b>


The psychological significance of having adequately functioning sensory
systems can hardly be overemphasized. The abilities of sight, hearing, touch,
taste, and smell contribute in a variety of ways to the individual's adaptation
to the physical and social environment and to the individual's sense of
personal competence. Deleterious age-related changes in any of these systems
can detract from the individual's ability to enjoy a variety of sensory experiences,
move about in the environment, and participate in social interactions
without feeling awkward or uncomfortable.


VISION


Structural changes in the eye associated with the aging process result in a
number of important changes in visual perception. These conditions include
alterations in refractive power leading to hypermetropia (farsightedness).
Presbyopia is another significant change, developing in adults past the age of
40 years, in which the individual has difficulty focusing on near objects. There
is a general reduction in visual acuity that is especially severe at low levels of
illumination, such as driving at night and when tracking moving objects
(Panek, Barrett, Sterns, &amp; Alexander, 1977; Richards, 1977). Dark adaptation
is reduced so that older adults have greater difficulty adjusting to movement
from bright to dim lighting and have lower absolute levels of ability to see in

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Many, if not all, age effects on visual functions can be explained in terms
of the effects of normal aging on the optical structures (Scheie &amp; Albert, 1977;
Weale, 1963). One major set of changes pertains to the clarity of the visual
image reaching the retina. The image reaching the retina is clouded by
increased density and opacity of the lens (Spector, 1982) and by the formation
of opacities in the vitreous, the clear gelatinous matter that fills part of the
eyeball between the retina and the lens. Adding to these structural changes
are changes in the retina itself, including declines in the number of photoreceptors
(rods and cones) (Ordy, Brizzee, &amp; Johnson, 1982), the accumulation
of debris in the outermost layer of the retina (Marmor, 1980), and the
detachment of the vitreous from the surface of the retina (Scheie &amp; Albert,
1977; Weale, 1963). The amount of light reaching the retina is diminished by
the condition known as <i>senile miosis</i>, the reduction in the size of the pupil due
to atrophy of the iris dilator (Carter, 1982).


In addition to these changes that reduce the quality of the visual image on
the retina are changes in the lens that decrease its capacity to accommodate
to necessary changes in focus as objects move closer or farther away from the
individual, leading to presbyopia. In addition to becoming denser, the lens
fibers become harder and less elastic (Fisher, 1969; Paterson, 1979). The loss
of accommodative power of the lens due to these changes is referred to as
presbyopia, and it is a condition that typically requires correction between the
ages of 40 to 50 years. By the age of 60 years, the lens is completely incapable
of accommodating to focus on objects at close distance (Moses, 1981). The
lens also becomes yellowed due to an accumulation of yellow pigment, and
as a result, the older adult is less able to discriminate colors in the green-blue-violet
end of the spectrum (Weale, 1963).


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


Age-related changes in the functioning of the eye can have a range of effects
on the individual's functioning in everyday life and range from difficulties in
visual processing speed, light sensitivity, near vision, visual search, and the
ability to adjust to varying distances. These changes influence the ability to

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Compensatory Measures</i>


Although there are no practical measures that individuals can take to
overcome the effects of age on the structures of the eye, there are compensatory
steps available to help the older person overcome some of the effects of
aging on visual sensation. Appropriate increases in ambient lighting that
increase the availability of illumination without increasing glare can help
offset age effects on retinal illumination. Increasing the available light is
especially important in areas that tend to be dimly lit, such as halls, stairways,
entrances, and landings. Yellowish light is preferable for these purposes
because bluish light is scattered more by the lens (Richards, 1977; Weale,
1963). Errors in depth perception, when they occur, are particularly deleterious
because they can lead to accidental falls (Tobis, Nayak, &amp; Hoehler, 1981).
Familiarizing an older adult with a new setting can help reduce the likelihood
of falls due to faulty depth perception. Improvements in visual functioning as
the result of surgery or other corrective measures can have important ramifications
in a number of areas of everyday life due to the increased autonomy
these changes make possible (Brenner, Curbow, Javitt, Legro, &amp; Sommer,
1993). Apart from these measures, most older adults seem to adapt spontaneously
to visual problems in driving caused by changes in visual perception,
either by reducing their driving overall, avoiding night driving, becoming
more cautious or by relying on their many years of driving experience
(Owsley, Ball, Sloane, Roenker, &amp; Bruni, 1991).


HEARING


<i>Presbycusis</i>, the general term used to refer to age-related hearing loss,
actually includes several specific subtypes reflecting different changes in the

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Speech perception, which is a major concern when considering the effects
of aging on hearing in everyday life, is affected both by the various forms of
presbycusis operating at the sensory level and by changes in the central
processing of auditory information at the level of the brain stem and above
(Van-Rooij &amp; Plomp, 1992). As mentioned earlier, the most common effect
of presbycusis is areduction in sensitivity to high-frequency tones. Translated
into speech discrimination, this means that older adults suffering from presbycusis
have greater difficulty perceiving sibilants, which are consonants that
have frequencies in the upper ranges of 3,000 to over 6,000 Hz. The sibilants
include the underlined phonemes in these words: plus, <u>x</u>erox, <u>sh</u>ip, a<u>z</u>ure,
wren<u>ch</u>, and dru<u>dg</u>e. The English language is rich in these phonemes, particularly
the s used in plurals so that loss of the ability to hear these sounds can
have a particularly damaging effect on everyday speech.


In addition to the effects of aging on speech discrimination due to the loss
of high-pitched tone sensitivity are the effects of aging on the ability to hear
under conditions of interference or distraction. Age effects begin to appear
even as early as 40 years in the understanding of sentences under a variety of
distorting conditions, particularly when the speech signal is interrupted
(Bergman, 1971; Bergman et al., 1976). Other conditions known to impair
speech perception in the aged include higher rate of presentation, deletion of
parts of the message, competition from background noise or competing
messages, and reverberation (Neils, Newman, Hill, &amp; Weiler, 1991; Whitbourne,
1986).


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


Deficits in hearing make it particularly difficult for the older individual to
communicate in a variety of social settings. Although empirical investigation
does not support the long-held belief that hearing loss contributes to psychological
disorder in later life, these changes in communication ability can lead
to strains in interpersonal relationships and greater caution on the part of the
older person who wishes to avoid making inappropriate responses to uncertain
auditory signals. There is also some evidence linking significant hearing loss
to impaired physical functioning (Bess et al., 1989) and psychological difficulties,
including loneliness (Christian, Dluhy, &amp; O'Neill, 1989) and depression
(Kalayam et al., 1991). Depression is not consistently found to be related
to hearing loss (Norris &amp; Cunningham, 1981; Powers &amp; Powers, 1978).

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

BALANCE


The effects of age on the vestibular organs involve both the sensory
structures and the links to the higher levels of the nervous system. The hair
cells degenerate and are reduced in number, particularly in the saccule
(Johnsson &amp; Hawkins, 1972; Rosenhall &amp; Rubin, 1975). The vestibular nerve
fibers begin to degenerate in response to accumulation of bony material in the
inner ear structures that encase them (Krmpotic-Nemanic, 1969). Adding to
these changes at the level of the sensory structures are reductions in the
numbers of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (Hall, Miller, &amp; Corsellis, 1975),
which could result in the lowering of reflexive abilities to adjust the body's
posture to changes in position.


These changes in the vestibular system can result in increased dizziness and
vertigo in older adults (Toglia, 1975). Not only are these sensations unpleasant,
but they can increase the likelihood of accidental falls (Maki, Holliday,
&amp; Topper, 1994). Consistent with findings in studies of nystagmus across age
groups of adults is a decrease in this response after the age of 70 years (Bruner
&amp; Norris, 1971; DiZio &amp; Lackner, 1990), reflecting the cumulative loss of
sensory receptors over the adult years. Although it might be expected that
dizziness and vertigo would negatively affect the individual's ability to
maintain a static posture, compensation is possible through training that
involves the positional receptors in the somesthetic system (Babin &amp; Harker,
1982; Lord, Clark, &amp; Webster, 1991b) and the postural muscles (Hu &amp;
Woollacott, 1994a, 1994b).


TASTE AND SMELL


Because they are continuously replenished from their surrounding epithelial
cells, the number of taste buds shows no appreciable decline over the
adult years (Engen, 1982). Nevertheless, the detection thresholds for all four
primary tastes are significantly higher for many adults over the age of 60 years
(Grzegorczyk, Jones, &amp; Mistretta, 1979; Moore, Nielsen, &amp; Mistretta, 1983),
particularly for bitter tastes (Murphy &amp; Gilmore, 1989). Cross-sectional
observations also indicate a decrease in the ability to identify foods and flavors
in foods among middle-aged and older adults (Cain, Reid, &amp; Stevens, 1990;
Schiffman, 1977; Stevens, Cain, Demarque, &amp; Ruthruff, 1991) and preference
for higher concentrations of flavoring in certain kinds of food (DeGraaf, Polet,
&amp; VanStaveren, 1994). The discrepancy between anatomical and perceptual
data on taste perception might be accounted for by undetected age changes in
the regeneration of taste buds, the possibility that laboratory measures of taste
exaggerate the effects of aging, and that factors other than age, such as

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Corresponding to a reduction in olfactory receptors are cross-sectional
reports of diminished sensitivity to odors among older adults (Cain &amp; Stevens,
1989; Murphy, 1983; Stevens &amp; Cain, 1987); however, there is wide variation
among the over-60 population based in large part on health status (Doty et al.,
1984), and it appears that a variety of diseases can interfere with smell
thresholds (Doty, 1989; Weiffenbach &amp; Bartoshuk, 1992). Contributing to
age effects on basic smell sensitivity may be difficulties in labeling rather than
smelling (Schemper, Voss, &amp; Cain, 1981). As is true with taste, there may be
many lifestyle variations and cognitive factors that contribute to apparent
cross-sectional age effects in smell sensitivity.


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


The main psychological effect of age changes in taste and smell are in food
enjoyment. Reduced sensitivity to flavors in food may lower the individual's
motivation to eat or lead to unhealthy addition of seasonings such as salts and
sugars. In addition, age losses in smell sensitivity may have adverse effects
on the individual's ability to detect the odors of dangerous toxins or the
presence of a fire. A reduced sensitivity to bodily odors might also make the
individual less fastidious in personal grooming habits so that others avoid
close personal contact. Although these undesirable outcomes form a possible
scenario, it is also important to point out that age differences in taste and smell
are not found consistently and that when they do exist, may be relatively
insignificant in daily life as compared to the laboratory.


<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


The major forms of compensation for age losses in taste and smell involve
the avoidance of bad habits, particularly smoking, starting in adulthood.
Adequate dental care also plays a role in preserving taste sensitivity. Apart
from these preventive measures, adults can compensate for the effect of any
age losses in taste and smell on food enjoyment by using flavor enhancers
(Schiffman &amp; Warwick, 1989; Weiffenbach &amp; Bartoshuk, 1992) and by using
other sensory cues, particularly for avoiding exposure to dangerous fumes or
toxins.

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Normal Age Changes in Cognitive Functioning</b>


Just as changes in the body's appearance and functioning require adaptation
to the environment and self-concept via compensation, similar processes can
be examined regarding changes in cognitive abilities.


INFORMATION PROCESSING


One overall finding to emerge from research on information processing is
a general slowing down with age in reaction time, particularly when complex
decisions are required (Salthouse, 1985). Part of this slowing can be accounted
for by less efficient attentional processes. Older adults have greater difficulty
integrating information, both in laboratory tasks involving visual display
information (Plude &amp; Doussard-Roosevelt, 1989) and in simulated driving
situations (Brouwer, Waterink, Van-Wolffelaar, &amp; Rothengatter, 1991). They
are less able to ignore or inhibit their processing of irrelevant information
(McDowd &amp; Filion, 1992) and are at a disadvantage when they must divide
their attention among two or more complex tasks at once (Plude &amp; Doussard-Roosevelt,
1990). It takes older adults longer to make a decision, particularly
when the task involves complex choices (Cerella, Poon, &amp; Williams, 1980;
Salthouse &amp; Somberg, 1982). Increased difficulty in preparing a response adds
further to the slowing of response speed, particularly when the expected response
is not clearly indicated (Stelmach, Goggin, &amp; Garcia-Colera, 1987). Last,
when a complex response is demanded, such as using both hands simultaneously,
older adults show a disproportionate loss of speed compared to younger
adults (Light &amp; Spirduso, 1990; Stelmach, Amrhein, &amp; Goggin, 1988).


The underlying reason for slowing of response time with age is a reduction
in the efficiency and effectiveness of information processing in the central
nervous system of the older adult (Hartley, 1992). The effect of neuronal loss
might occur through a direct one-to-one link between information loss and a
reduction in neuron number (Myerson, Hale, Wagstaff, Poon, &amp; Smith, 1990).
A more complex proposal is that as individual neurons are lost, the connecting
pathways in the brain's neural network become less efficient (Cerella, 1990).


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


The individual's ability to monitor and pace reactions to speeded tasks
depends not only on the integrity of the central nervous system but on the
ability to work on problems without distractions from extraneous information
or from negative affective states. According to one view of aging's effects on
response times, increasing age brings with it a diminished ability to screen

<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


There is growing evidence that people who are in better physical condition in
terms of cardiovascular functioning do not experience the same degree of change
in reaction time as those whose physical fitness is poor (Baylor &amp; Spirduso, 1988;
Chodzko-Zajko, 1991; Chodzko-Zajko et al., 1992; Milligan, Powell, Harley, &amp;
Furchtgott, 1984; Spirduso, 1980). Along the same lines, as noted earlier,
involvement in exercise training programs may improve a variety of cognitive
functions in the older individual, although the effects may be limited in individuals
who have maintained an active life style throughout adulthood (Madden,
Allen, Blumenthal, &amp; Emery, 1989). Training specific to improving response
time can also be effective for older adults (Salthouse, 1990b). In addition to
training and physical activity as a way of maintaining cognitive and psychomotor
functioning, individuals can find other ways to compensate for age-related
slowing in response time. One way is to monitor the rate as well as accuracy of
responses on particular tasks so that not all tasks are performed with the same
accuracy if accuracy varies in importance from task to task. Second, the individual
can develop automaticity in frequently performed tasks to reduce the central
processing demand. Third, the individual can become aware of the role that
anxiety plays in reaction time and learn to reduce distractions from concern over
how one's performance looks to others. All of these techniques involve developing
conscious control mechanisms that monitor performance so that the individual
gains greater ability to adjust the rate of performance to the situation. Finally,
the individual may "compensate" by not becoming overly concerned about slight
delays in response time. Age-related losses in the laboratory are not necessarily
reflected as important decrements in the performance of tasks in real-life situations
(Schaie, 1988).


MEMORY


There is general agreement among researchers in cognition that aging
brings with it a decline in the efficiency of <i>working memory</i>, the component

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Looking to the recall of newly acquired events and information, such as
memory for the name of a person one met the evening before or the title of a
book recommended by a friend, there is again solid evidence of a decline in
performance across age groups of individuals (Kausler, 1982). Explanations
for this effect are diverse, ranging from focus on the stages of memory (viz.,
sensory, short-term, long-term) to the processes involved in the encoding and
retrieval of information. According to levels of processing theory, the "deeper"
the information is processed the more durable the trace is formed in memory
(Craik &amp; Tulving, 1975). Deep processing involves forming rich, elaborate, and
distinctive associations to the material and to place the material in context. One
approach to explaining age differences in event memory is that older adults fail
to take advantage of deeper levels of processing because the deleterious effects
of aging on the central nervous system limit the resources that the older individual
has to use in performing cognitive operations. Limited processing capacity affects
not only the encoding of new information but also the retrieval of this information
when it is needed at a later time (Craik, 1992).


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


The <i>processing deficiency</i> explanation of memory changes in later life is
based on a limited resource model of aging in which age-related cognitive

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The production deficiency hypothesis proposes that older adults fail to use
the more effective memory strategies involving deeper levels of processing
because they are not aware of the strategies they could use that could
potentially benefit their encoding and retrieval of information. This production
deficiency hypothesis holds out more hope to individuals who are
concerned about memory loss with age because it suggests ways to compensate
for what might otherwise be perceived as an inevitable feature of aging
(Whitbourne, 1986).


Evidence germane to the production deficiency hypothesis comes from the
area of metamemory research, which captures a set of related concepts
pertaining to what individuals know about memory, including how to take
advantage of memory strategies, their own knowledge of their memory
capacity, and what predictions they can make about their memory performance
on future tasks (Dixon, 1989; Hertzog, Dixon, Schulenberg, &amp; Hultsch,
1987; Lovelace &amp; Marsh, 1985). In support of the idea that lack of awareness
of memory strategies contributes to age declines in memory is the finding that
aged individuals do not monitor their memories effectively or make good use
of their capacities (Lachman, Lachman, &amp; Thronesberry, 1979). They may
also fail to use spontaneously the encoding and retrieval strategies that could
otherwise help their performance (Perlmutter &amp; Mitchell, 1982). Affective
factors can also play a role in metamemory, and the more distressed the older
person becomes about poor memory performance or the more anxious the
individual is about a memory task, the less able he or she will be to take
advantage of useful strategies. There is evidence that affective factors such as
these do in fact play a role in memory performance (Cavanaugh &amp; Poon,
1989). In terms of predicting performance, another component of metamemory,
there are some interesting relationships between age and task familiarity.
When given information about the characteristics of the memory task, older
and younger adults are equivalent in predicting their performance, but older
adults overestimate their performance when they are not told specifically
about the nature of the task (Cavanaugh, 1989).


<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


The production deficiency explanation of memory loss in the aged has
obvious implications for modes of compensation for age-related deficits in
working and long-term memory. Another source of compensation for impaired

INTELLIGENCE


The abilities of reasoning, judgment, problem solving, and decision making
are incorporated into the broad construct of <i>intelligence</i>. Theories of intelligence
differ from one another in the proposed components of intelligence as
well as the extent to which intelligence is reflected in day-to-day activities of
the individual. In terms of research on aging, the approach to intelligence that
has gained the most popularity involves the distinction between crystallized
and fluid intelligence. It is reasonably well established from both cross-sectional
and longitudinal studies that crystallized intelligence, which reflects
experience and education in specific areas of expertise, shows consistent gains
over the years of adulthood and into old age. By contrast, fluid intelligence,
conceptualized as the processing of new information, peaks in early adulthood
and shows a consistent decline thereafter (Horn &amp; Donaldson, 1980). Overall,
the pattern of intellectual development across the life span is one of general
stability until the late 60s with more pronounced decrements occurring by the
early 80s. There is wide variability in terms of individual patterns of change
during these years, however, and the magnitude of these decrements does not
necessarily have large practical significance (Hertzog &amp; Schaie, 1986; Schaie,
1988).


<i>Psychological Interactions</i>


Research on intelligence in older adults has historically been marked by
methodological concerns, particularly those pertaining to the confounding
effects of the "environment" on intelligence test scores (Schaie, 1990). When

<i>Compensatory Mechanisms</i>


The effects of aging on intelligence can be compensated for in measurable
ways, either through spontaneous strategies used by the individual or through
involvement in organized educational training programs (Baltes &amp; Linden-berger,
1988; Willis &amp; Schaie, 1994). Furthermore, as a result of their greater
life experiences, older adults can develop the quality of wisdom (Baltes,
Smith, &amp; Staudinger, 1992) that serves as a major compensating factor for
whatever losses they experience in the ability to manipulate symbols or puzzle
pieces.


<b>Summary</b>


In this brief review of the psychology of normal aging, I have attempted to
provide information on expectable changes in later life and to suggest ways
that physical and cognitive age-related changes can interact with other psychological
processes. I have also focused on compensatory mechanisms and
ways that clinicians can maximize the potential for positive functioning in
later life. From this review, several main points have emerged that cut across
the specific areas, and these will be summarized here.


First, it is apparent that there are important interactions between age
changes in various systems and the individual's interpretation of these changes.
Age-related losses in important areas of functioning may be viewed with great
unhappiness, leading to a reciprocal process in which anxiety over these losses
contributes to further deterioration of those very functions. Conversely, if the
individual is challenged to find ways to prevent further losses or to reverse
those that are amenable to change, then the processes of aging can be
significantly altered. Here again, though, extreme anxiety can be detrimental

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A second point is that many age-related changes can be compensated by
following the "use it or lose it" principle or by finding ways to substitute
functions that are efficient with those that are on the decline. By the same
token, the avoidance of bad habits, particularly cigarette smoking, a sedentary
lifestyle, and overuse of alcohol, can help maintain higher levels of functioning
in many bodily and cognitive systems.


Last, from a clinical perspective, knowledge of the aging process is extremely
vital to a wide range of mental health practitioners. At the simplest
level, education can provide aging clients with normative information about
the aging process to counteract harmful myths and stereotypes. The recommendation
of specific ways to compensate for age-related losses can be even
more beneficial, along with support and encouragement in what may be a
difficult process to initiate. Clinicians who work with clients with elderly
relatives can also benefit from knowledge of aging, as aging family members
can present issues that are of concern to younger adults seeking psychological
services.


Many mental health professionals, when contemplating the prospect of
treating the elderly, look on the enterprise as difficult, depressing, and of
limited value given the broad scope of age-related declines. The information
presented in this chapter suggests that there is remarkable flexibility and
resiliency in older peoples' response to decremental change, underscoring the
potential of intervention.
