BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: [Adjusts microphone]
[Door opens]
THERAPIST: Hi, come right in [inaudible at 00:12]
CLIENT: Thank you.
[Door closes]
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you.
CLIENT: Good. So I set up an appointment with, um, the woman that you spoke to in Concord.
THERAPIST: Great.
CLIENT: So I'm pretty...
THERAPIST: [This is for Dr. Jeffreys] (ph)?
CLIENT: Yes, exactly. Um, [clucks] so I'm happy about that. She doesn't take insurance, [clears throat and coughs] but she says that she can help me probably find someone who does. Um...
THERAPIST: Well, I don't either, you know.
CLIENT: Oh, you don't?
THERAPIST: I don't take — the reason that your insurance covers it...
CLIENT: Mm.
THERAPIST: ...Is because you're allowed to see — any people out of network, too.
CLIENT: Oh.
THERAPIST: So then it would mean — she says she doesn't take insurance; that means she doesn't participate with any panels. [00:01:01]
CLIENT: Uh-huh?
THERAPIST: And I don't, either, but some - that's what I was saying with the PPO plan. Some insurances will reimburse regard — like, it doesn't matter...
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: So that's — so just to clarify that confusion.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: So if you do have a PPO plan — I mean, I submit for you — I don't care - stu — university — um, universities, usually, will process as easier because they basically take care of your better.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But, um, like the other thing that you — like, if you had a PPO plan, and you would pay her, and then you'd just submit it, and they'd give you money back.
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: So — so that's why it is helpful to have a PPO plan because then you don't need someone who takes insurance.
CLIENT: Right, OK. OK, good to know because, yeah, he — he contacted his work and found out about, um, insurance and so...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: ...I don't know if he knows that, but he knows it is through Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and so — and then....
THERAPIST: Yeah, is he working for a big, big firm or a small firm?
CLIENT: Yes, it is big for Concord, but [chuckles] I don't know. [00:02:01]
THERAPIST: 'Cause the only reason I ask is that, sometimes, if it is a smaller place, it is like, "This is your health plan," that's it.
CLIENT: [Clucks] Yeah.
THERAPIST: Whereas, if there's a — it is a bigger place, they give you options.
CLIENT: I think it — they said, like, if we go through Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and then he'll — he'll decide from there, like, what kind of...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: ...Package or, you know, what plan.
THERAPIST: So you're better off — so HMO plans...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...Won't — won't cover unless they're part — unless the person participates, which you may know people who do.
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: But if you have a PPO plan, you can go to anybody.
CLIENT: OK, OK. Good to know. [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, yeah, he — after I left here, I didn't want to forget anything that you told me, so I called Chris, and so he wrote it all down, what you had, you know, recommended with the PPO, and you talked about the...
THERAPIST: That's [like spending] (ph), too.
CLIENT: Yes, exactly. So, yeah, [chuckles] I wrote it all down in trying to remember it all, everything. Um, that's a relief. It makes me a little bit nervous because she's going to be gone the first week that — in there, but then — so I'm going to have, like, a week without anything, [chuckles] so then I feel a little bit nervous 'cause — I don't know. [00:03:09]
THERAPIST: What are you nervous about?
CLIENT: Um, I'm getting [becomes emotional] really sad about leaving. [Pauses] Um, I'm nervous because I've come to rely on this process to help me — like, I'll think during the week, [sniffles] um, like it is a — it is a Friday, and I'll think, like — and I'll feel tense and [don't think it is OK] (ph), just have to get to Monday, and then I — and then I'll [sniffles] — you know, I have an appointment and I'll feel better. Um, and so I'm nervous to go [inhales] [becomes emotional] — I don't know - [pauses for nine seconds] just be [sighs] [pauses for 12 seconds] without something that is comfortable. [Sniffles] It makes me feel better. I don't know. [00:04:22]
[Silence for 13 seconds]
[Sniffles] And I was having dreams about the girls last night, that I lost them, that we were, like — that we were out, and I thought Sadie was going to school, and somebody — like a neighbor was taking her to school, and she came back to the house to get something, and then she was, like, trying to get to school with the neighbor, but — like, I knew she wasn't going to make — I don't know - like, I just lost her. [Sniffles] And [pauses] I don't know. I think I'm just — it is like me being upset about leaving them is manifesting in [pauses for five seconds] — [00:05:13]
And then I had a whole dream about them hiring — they're not hiring a new nanny; they're going to school full-time, and then, in the fall, Andrea, their mom, is going to work part-time, which is a new thing. Um, [sniffles] but I had a whole dream about them hiring a new nanny, and there was like seven different babysitters there...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Like that, and I was trying to, like, tell them what they needed to look for and what they — the par — like, Andrea and Todd, the parents — I was trying to tell them what they needed to do in order to, like, make sure the girls were OK, and...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: [Mumbles] <i>Mmm</i>. [Begins to cry] [sighs] [00:06:00]
[Silence for 25 seconds]
I'm just — [sniffles] and I think I — [clucks] like, Andrea and Todd want — those are the parents of the girls — they want us to stay close, and they want me to, you know, still be really involved in the girls' lives, and that's something that I want, too; I just don't really know if that's going to — going to really particularly click with Andrea and Todd. And, like, they — they'll say, like, "You could just like still come on family vacations with us and things like that," and, like, things that I just — I won't — I know I won't want to do, and that I'll know when the time comes, and so I just, you know — I wonder how much I'm actually going to still see [becomes emotional] the girls or be [sniffles] [pauses] — [rubs something] [weakly] I don't know. [00:07:05]
[Pauses] They mean, like, "Come on family vacations and, like, work for us." [Sighs] Just — and it is like, you know, and we — [drops something] [fidgets] — that — I don't know if that's something I'd really want to do. [Sniffles] It is not like other families that I've left in the past, when I — you know, there was a family in Seattle I just got really close to. And they're still my friends; they're my really good friends, still. And that was like the last family I left that I felt this hard. [Sniffles] Other families have just been — it has not been this hard to leave [pauses] just 'cause it has been so long since Hetty [becomes emotional] was born. [00:08:01]
THERAPIST: [Faintly] Mm.
CLIENT: [Pauses] [Begins to cry] I don't know why — like, I just — I know that she's the baby [becomes emotional] - isn't — she's not a baby; she's two and a half now — but she's not going to remember anything [sniffles] and she's not going to remember [becomes emotional] this at all, and I think that's probably — that's not a bad thing for her; that's a good thing. Like I don't want her to remember me leaving her, but it also makes me [becomes emotional] a little sad. [Begins to cry] [Sniffles]
[00:09:00]
[Continues crying, sniffles/pauses for 38 seconds]
Yeah, I don't know. [Weakly] I'm just not [pauses] very happy right now.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're both sad and a little worried.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] And then, now, I'm just in this mode where I just want to go. Like, I almost, like — I hate — I'm almost hating that this last week is even — like, I just, like, [Exasperatedly] "Ohh, I just want to go!" Like, I just want to — like, it just makes me too — the whole, like, build-up to everything makes me too anxious and makes me too nervous. I have — like, it just makes me tense. [00:10:00]
[Sniffles] [Shifts in seat] [Pauses for 17 seconds] [Clucks] Yeah. We're having, like, a goodbye — like, on Friday, we're having a goodbye dinner, and so, like, I made a little book for the girls with all the pictures over the last few years, for them to keep, and then — and I know that I'm just going to be a crying mess. [Chuckles] It is like I almost don't — I, like, hate — I'm hav — you know, we need to, like, say goodbye, but I don't — I am kind of dreading it at the same time [sniffles] 'cause it is going to be pretty awful. And I don't want them to see me crying. I don't want them to see me, like, upset. I don't know. [Pauses] [00:10:56]
There've been days [sniffles] that I've been work, and something's happened with [voice shakes] Hetty, [becomes emotional] and I'll realize that I'm not going to — like, I'll just [begins to cry] — like, I'll go to get her from nap, and it'll make me so sad knowing — 'cause, like, that's a really sweet time. She wakes up, and we snuggle, and she, like, tells me about all her little animals in her crib, [sniffles] and I'll get really upset, and I'll have to leave. I don't want her to see me. Like, I think that's just confusing for her [sniffles], and so - [sounds as if getting a tissue] another one?
[Silence for 10 seconds]
THERAPIST: Confusing — how?
CLIENT: I don't think — you know, she's just too little to understand. Like, she can see that I'm upset, but she can't process why, and I think that's — like, I don't want to make her feel nervous because that's just an unpredictable thing for a little kid. I don't — I think that that would — like, she doesn't — she just doesn't know how to process that, [sniffles] and I just don't — you know, I'd prefer that she not see me and - you know — crying; I just don't think that that's good. [00:12:16]
THERAPIST: How would it make her nervous?
CLIENT: [Sniffles] I don't know. I think, like, when any kid sees an adult [pauses] being fragile or being, like, un — you know, [pauses] — I just think that if she can't - like, can't understand it, then it'll just make her nervous - I don't know - 'cause, like, if she can tell that something's wrong, and she doesn't know what it is, then that would — I don't know — I just feel like that would be upsetting for her.
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:12:56]
CLIENT: [Sniffles]
[Pauses for 30 seconds]
Like, I'll explain to her — I'll sit down, and we'll talk, and I'll say — like, you know, 'cause sh — I brought her to my apartment to show her that all my — all of the things were gone, 'cause I wanted her to — like, Sadie, who's almost five, can — has a little bit of a better grasp on it. It is still really — I'm sure that she won't really get it until I'm gone, but you can still talk to her about it, and she can still — like, she knows wherever — you know, she went to my wedding, so she knows New Hampshire is, like — you have to drive a long way to — she knows, she gets all that, like, "I'm not going to be here anymore; I'm going to be there." She understands those kinds of things. But Hetty is two. Like, she just doesn't — and so I brought her to my apartment and said, like, "See, all of our things are at a <i>new</i> house now," like, "This isn't Jenny and Chris's anymore. We don't —" — you know, I wanted her to, like, <i>see</i> it. I don't know. [00:14:16]
And then I've been talking, and I've been saying, like, "Jenny is going to go to a new house, and then I'm not going to come anymore, but I'm going to be your friend, and — and you'll see me on the computer like you see your Auntie and —" — you know, she lives in Chicago, so try to relate it in that way, and [sniffles] — I don't know. She's obviously just not going to — she's not going to get it, but — so —
And then she saw me get upset one day, and I said it is — you know, "It is 'cause I'm sad because I'm going to miss you, and I'm not going to see you." And she said, "Jenny's happy now!" [Chuckles] She just — you know, she just wanted me to be done being sad, [sniffles] I think 'cause it just made her uncomfortable. [Pauses for five seconds] We don't talk about it. I made it seem like we [chuckles] talk about it all the time. It is very, like — you know, it is just a few times every — you know, once in a while, recently. [00:15:18]
But, [pauses for 12 seconds] yeah, we made cards for some — my friend Emma - the kids that she nannies for came over for, like, our last play date, so we made cards to say goodbye because they're just not going to see those kids again because they only come over for [slaps surface] — because Emma brings them, and so we made cards to say goodbye to them. And they're three, and so I was explaining to <i>them</i> what was — you know, that I'm not going to be Sadie and Hetty's nanny anymore, and why I wasn't going to be there anymore and, you know, those kinds of things. And Hetty — we were all sitting at the table, eating lunch, and Hetty just stopped eating and was just <i>staring</i> at me intently. And I didn't notice it until — 'cause I was concentrating on the twins who were over for the play date, and I just [shifts in seat] — I didn't notice it until I was, like, almost done explaining it to them, that she just hadn't moved and was just <i>staring</i> at me while I was saying it. And [pauses] I don't know — I'm probably just projecting, probably just, like — [weakly] I don't know. [00:16:41]
THERAPIST: How do you mean "projecting?"
CLIENT: [Slaps surface] Like I imagine that she's going to be so sad, and like, you know, it is going to be so confusing and hard for her. But maybe that's because, like, I want it to be because I - like, you know, I imagine myself as this huge role in her life, and I — you know, I <i>want</i> to be, maybe, like that big of a figure to her, that she would be — like, maybe I'm just mak — I don't know. [Sniffles] Mm, maybe I'm just, like, [becomes emotional] making a bigger deal out of it. I mean, [pauses for five seconds] nannies leave; that's what happens. That's — I'm not her mother, [sniffles] so — [pauses] <i>Mmm.</i> [00:17:41]
THERAPIST: Well, it seems that one of the things you're thinking a lot about is memory and what you'll take with you.
CLIENT: Mm.
THERAPIST: Like the way you described, like — I know it is kind of — the details are a [chuckles] little bit confusing, but like needing to call Chris right away 'cause you're worried about what you're going to forget...
CLIENT: Mm.
THERAPIST: ...And you're wondering whether — I'm sorry, the youngest one, again, is...? [00:18:00]
CLIENT: Hetty.
THERAPIST: ...Hetty — like what she'll forget, and then this association to bringing her to this empty apartment.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know? It is like there's — there's something about what you're going to take inside of you and what's going to, like, leave...
CLIENT: Mm.
THERAPIST: ...And not be a part of you.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] I don't know. [Pauses] [Sniffles] By taking her to the apartment, I just wanted to, like — I — [chuckles] I just — that was the best way to show her so that she understood. And I, for some reason, didn't want her to think that I would just still be here and not coming to see her. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I don't know. [Sniffles] [Fidgets]
[00:19:00]
[Silence for 58 seconds]
CLIENT: I do have a really terrible memory. I [chuckles] don't know what it is about, but, like, I won't remember — I just don't remember — like, I remember [pauses] — I can't remember the simplest things. [Clucks] We got a car over the weekend, and we went to the mechanic to get it checked out before we bought it, and the mechanic said that there were these [slaps surface] four things that should happen if we were going to buy it, and I couldn't remember yesterday. And we did it on Saturday. I was like — I was thinking, "Well, it is a good thing Chris it taking the car back to the mechanic today because I can't remember what those things were, at all." And then I just — I just don't remember. I don't know. And then I was — it was kind of weird to me that I just can't remember things. [Sniffles] Like, I'll remember idea — like, conc — like, I remember that he said, like — I remember one of the things was 'cause, like, a spring, and if that's broken, then the car [slaps surface] is like this, but that's all I — I don't remember that. Or like you talked about the account fees. I remember, like — I remember the <i>ideas</i> of things, but I don't remember specifics; I don't remember terms. Even when I'm trying to recall things, like a story — I don't know — I just don't remember, so - [Sniffles] It does make me a little nervous or uncomfortable. [00:21:28]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I don't know. My brain's [chuckles in exasperation] not working right. [Lightly slaps surface] [Fidgets] [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you're worried about relying on yourself. [00:21:54]
CLIENT: [Slaps surface] Mm-hmm. [Pauses for five seconds] Yeah. But also, at times, I — I feel like it works for my — like, I just want [pauses] — I don't know. Like, I just want my time with the girls to be over because I know — the only reason I'm really sad today is 'cause I'm starting — you know, today's my last week, and it is like — it is going to be really hard, but I know that, as soon as it is done, I'm going to be sad and I'm going to miss them. But this is the hardest part of it. This is like [sniffles] still seeing them and knowing I'm not going to see them anymore. And — and then, in a couple days, I'm — it is really — I just — I know that I'm just going to kind of like block it.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Like, I just don't — I won't really — I know that I just won't feel <i>this</i> much about it. [Clucks] Which is — I know that's normal, or that's natural, like everybody [slaps surface] — you don't carry around the sadness — the same amount of sadness that you feel when something initially happens, but I think that I — I do just kind of block things, in a way, to protect myself, to make it easier for myself. [00:23:20]
THERAPIST: Well, I'll certainly remember you.
CLIENT: Oh, thanks. [Sniffles] [Fidgets] [Shifts in seat]
[Silence for 17 seconds]
CLIENT: That made me really sad. [Chuckles] [Coughs, clears throat]
THERAPIST: Your impact on me...?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...And that I could miss you? [00:23:54]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [Sniffles] [Pauses for 15 seconds] Like, I also — is I just don't really say that to other people, either. Like, I'm not saying it to Emma and James. I'm not saying, like, "I'm really going to miss you. This is —" — like, I'm not saying that. [Sniffles] The only person I've said it to is Hetty. Like, I just — I'm not — and I realize I literally just don't — even though it is true, I just don't [becomes emotional] say it, and I think it is just [sniffles] — and I guess I just don't want myself — I don't know — to be vulnerable in that way? [Pauses] [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:24:50]
CLIENT: I only get upset to Chris or here, to you. [Sniffles] I think that's — [Chuckles] like when Hetty [chuckles] talks to her babies, so I'll [get that and cry] (ph). Hetty — every — sorry, I'm going back to Hetty again, but she likes to pretend to be — she only does it to me — Andrea said that she doesn't do it to her or Todd — she sits in my lap and says, "I'm a tiny baby. I'm your tiny baby," and then she wants me to pretend she's a baby. And I, like, cradle her, and I sing to —and then I, you know — and, every day, I come in to wake her up from nap. Bubble is her special snuggly thing. She — as soon as I open the door — "Bubble is a tiny baby!" [Clears throat] And I — it is like some — I know that it is some association that she is having...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...With me and with — I don't know — I just feel like she's thinking about something. [Sniffles] Um, like she is taking care of her Bubble. She'll say it — she'll want to be <i>my</i> tiny baby — that's what she [chuckles] calls it — to think [this up with me] (ph) — and then she'll — and then she, I guess, acts how she assumes I act to her Bubble. Like, she's doing what I do to Bubble. She's, like, snuggling him and putting his head on her shoulder, and then she pretends to feed — you know, she acts out the whole same thing? [00:26:27]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I don't know. I just can't figure out what that means, though. [Sniffles] And, like, I'm nervous I'm damaging [chuckles] her. Maybe I shouldn't — I don't know.
THERAPIST: How? How are you damaging her? [00:26:56]
CLIENT: [Clucks] [Slaps surface] I don't know. Like, I always say — kids - like, I always call her the baby. She's the baby, and I always [pauses] — I don't want her to — I don't know. [Sniffles] [Slaps surface] [Sighs]
[Silence for 40 seconds]
CLIENT: You know, I just don't if me emphasizing — like snuggling her and have — and babying her is, like, did I do something wrong? Was that wrong that I was always, like, - mmm — [00:28:06]
[Sniffles] [Sighs] - [pauses for 28 seconds] Mmm [pauses] I don't know. And think, then, that I just get sad that she's not [pauses] — I made — I don't know. [Clears throat] Her mom is not like a warm, snuggly kind of mom, and so I think I, like, made an extra point of being <i>really</i> snuggly and really — like, [clucks] notice that Sadie, her older sister, when I first started working there, they were like, "This kid doesn't really like —" — like, I know some people just don't like touch, a lot of touching, but like it wasn't — like, she just didn't like it like other kids like it. Like, she does — she didn't want to sit on your lap. She didn't want to — like, she's never — whenever I go to kiss her, she moves out of the way. Like, she doesn't [shifts in seat] — she's not really comfortable with a lot of touching, which I understand is just some people's — [slaps surface] but I think because their mom is so <i>not</i> touchy, I, like, really went overboard with Hetty. I was always really snuggly with her and always, like, kissing her, kissing her, kissing her, kissing her, [sniffles] and then I just get very, like, sad. I don't know. Like, I — [becomes emotional] I feel like she's a really snuggly kid, and then I guess I think, "What if she doesn't get that anymore?" Like she — [begins to cry] — I don't know. [Slaps surface] And I probably didn't — I'm probably attributing all these things that aren't, like, my doing what [sniffles] — it is probably just how she was born, [clucks] but then I get sad that she's not going to, like, [pauses] — [whispers] I don't know. [00:30:12]
THERAPIST: You're worried about her not getting the care that she needs, maybe you not getting the care that you need?
CLIENT: [Sniffles] Yeah. [Sniffles] [Sighs] [Fidgets]
[Silence for 28 seconds]
CLIENT: It is her first day of camp. She's there right now, and I'm really hoping it goes well.
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:30:58]
[Silence for 20 seconds]
CLIENT: [Sniffles] Mmm. [Clucks] [Whispers] I don't know. [Pauses for five seconds] But last night, when I was here, when I was talking about things that have changed — that I've change — like, that have changed in me and that — you know — I don't know. I think it is [slaps surface] — when we were talking about it, I said I've realized that [sniffles] this is totally not connected to anything else, but, um, I'll probably [becomes emotional] [slaps surface] — but, uh, I said I realize that I can't do the work for two people or do the work for other people in my life, and I then I was talking about, primarily, like, my brother and Chris, and — and realizing that it applies to all of the relationships that I have in my life? And I left and that — I kept thinking about that, and it scared the life out of me, like it just really [shifts in seat] — it <i>really</i> upset me after I left. And, uh, [pauses] - I don't know — it just scared the shit out of me because, even though I had kind of thought it before I had said it out loud, and it didn't make it real until I said it out loud. [00:32:40]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And [pauses] — I don't know — it just felt so real, and so it made me feel so helpless, and it made me feel so, like — I just hate that feeling, that I — I don't have the power to fix things, or that I don't [clucks] [sniffles] — I'm out of control. Um, and so [pauses] — I don't know — it made me feel really, just really scared. [00:33:12]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: [Clucks] And I've been thinking about it a lot.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: [Mumbles] I don't know. Like, my brother's been struggling a lot with his drinking, and it has just been driving me crazy [pauses for ten seconds] 'cause he's not trying to help himself. [Shifts in seat] But — [sniffles] Uhh [exhales]. Chris and I went through the whole car-buying process, which was really stressful, and did it very well together; I was really proud of us. We, you know, could have been [in a fit] (ph). Like, we got kind of scammed on this first car that we went to look at and... [00:34:18]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...And Chris's been really intense about researching everything, and, um [sniffles] — and I just stepped back and realized, like, this is just how he needs to do it. This is just going to be — like, [pauses] it bothers me [chuckles] a little bit but, at the same, it is not like not hurting me, so I just kind of step back and let him do his thing. And [pauses] [clucks] we were really excited about this one car, and our brother — Chris's brother-in-law, who knows tons about cars, went over to look at it and thought it was a great idea. But we wanted to get it checked by a mechanic first, so we went on Saturday, and, uh, the mechanic said there was a couple of problems with it, and the — it would cost us, like, $1,000 to get it all taken care of and to make sure the car was, like, in perfect condition. [00:35:01]
And Chris was really upset. And I wasn't really upset because I just thought, like, it is a 2002 Civic, and [clucks] only had 80,000 miles on it, but, like, it is still an <i>old</i> car. Like, there is probably going to be some things, you know, like — so I was kind of expecting it, but he was pretty bummed. And so, you know, we negotiated with the guy, and the guy wouldn't meet us where [slaps surface] we wanted to, so we walked away. And then, when we were leaving, I said, like, "Let's just sit down and talk about this for a while because I think we need to come to a — you know, [that's how we talked] (ph) I personally thought we should just — like, I had brought the car down from $6,700 to $5,200, which I thought was great, and I thought that we could really — reel it in there. [Shifts in seat] Chris wanted them to come down to $5,000, and I just — like, we talked about, and we ended up buying the car. And there was — it was just like — it wasn't easy, but we just didn't argue about it the whole time, and it was just — I stayed really — Chris wasn't, like, not calm, but he was just tense; he was really anxious about all of it. Um, but it was just — there was never any tension between the two of us... [00:36:12]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ....Which was really nice and kind of a relief, because I — I realized afterwards, like, that could have been — that could have been [pauses] an argument. [Shifts in seat]
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Like, that could have been really much more frustrating than it was. It was also <i>really</i> [chuckles] a frustrating, long day just because I went through other mishaps, but, uh, [pauses] - I don't know — it went — it went well. It was, [shifts in seat] I think, good practice for future, like, purchases or things like that, or — I don't know. [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: You went from feeling very scared about all the — all of the things out of your control, and especially how you can't control other people's problems... [00:37:01]
CLIENT: Mm.
THERAPIST: ...To feeling, like, "Well, but things can go OK anyway."
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah. I think — yeah, 'cause I was thinking on about that and I then I was thinking about, like, well, Chris didn't necessarily, like, change his personal — like anything, but I can change how I react to thing - ? Like, 'cause, normally, some things that he would have done would have driven me crazy. Like, when he got kind of like frustrated and upset that the car needed some work, that probably would have bothered me 'cause I would have felt like, "Are you a moron? Like, of course, if it is — it is a 10 year-old car, or a 11 year-old car. Like, of <i>course</i> it needs a [chuckles] second look." But it was like I can change how I react to those things and just — like, even though maybe other people still have their hardships, they're not mine to necessarily have. I guess that's the other part of it, is that, like, even though I can't change other people, the hardships that they have or the struggles that they have don't necessarily need to be my struggles, even if it is my husband, and even if it is my brother. Like, I can <i>support</i> them in the best way possible or the best of my ability, but I don't need to, like, take them <i>on</i> in this way that I have. [00:38:26]
THERAPIST: You don't have to be burdened by them.
CLIENT: Right, exactly. Mm, it just was — that was — I think I just didn't process it until just right now. It was connected in my head for whatever reason, but, um — 'cause I just remember, earlier in the week, feeling really scared by that, but now I'm kind of — yeah, just — I think that — the whole weekend made me feel a little bit better 'cause it is just OK. And like — I don't know — I just don't need to react to things. I would react in the past because I would know how hard those things were for them, or certain thing — you know, and so it would <i>really</i> upset me. And [pauses] I don't want to be, like, shut off to it, but I think I can be <i>better</i> than — like, I thought it was — maybe it can be better and then I can support them better by not getting so emotionally dragged into it...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Because, it is like, "Well, this isn't really my [chuckles] problem," but you get — and so if I just don't react, that's better for everybody.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It is better for <i>me,</i> and it is, uh, you know, better for other people that I love, I think.
THERAPIST: Well, it is a really important realization 'cause, when you're a kid, and your parents have a lot of problems, their problems are your problems 'cause you've got no one to take care of you if they've got so many problems.
CLIENT: Mm, right.
THERAPIST: Whereas, when you're adult and feel like you can rely on yourself more, then, I mean, you need other people, but you can still take care of yourself even if they have a lot of problems. [00:40:01]
CLIENT: Yeah, and that's been a hard thing for me to realize and a hard thing for me — like, I've been trying to exercise that muscle, I guess.
THERAPIST: Mmm.
CLIENT: And, um, [pauses] yeah.
THERAPIST: I wanted to know what has the audiotaping been like? Has that felt like it has affected things? Or what has that felt like?
CLIENT: In here?
THERAPIST: Yeah - the audiotaping?
CLIENT: Um, [claps hand] I totally don't really — I don't really think about [chuckles] it. Um, every once in a while, I will. Every once in a while, like, I'll think about it, and I'll think, like, [pauses] "Huh, whoever listens to [chuckles] this might think I'm bat-shit crazy." Um, or, like, every once in a while, it'll come to — to the front of my mind, but almost never.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I — I almost don't — like, I'll think about it sometimes when I'm about to come here... [00:41:00]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: [Clucks] ...scheduling? (ph) Um, and sometimes, when we're talking, I sometimes will suddenly realize it for some reason, but almost never. I'd say, like, once every like three or four sessions, it'll pop in my head, but...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Nothing that I would ever get hung up on.
THERAPIST: It is, um — it is very helpful to know...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...'Cause, you know, it is obviously a good resource, but I want to — it is helpful to know that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It sounds like it hasn't felt like it has sort of altered the process much, which is very helpful. I'm glad to hear that.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, not for me at all.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: It'd be one thing if I knew — like, if anything — I don't know — I've felt almost, like, good about it? Like, I've wanted to be more honest, if that makes any sense.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Like, when I've thought about it, I've thought about, like, because I know that it is going to, maybe, people who are — I mean, it is going [slaps surface] to med schools, right, in here? [00:42:03]
THERAPIST: Um, it is going to academic life (ph), so...
CLIENT: Academic — right.
THERAPIST: ...So social work, psychology, maybe psychol — you know, med circles, too. Sure.
CLIENT: Right, so I've almost thought about it in that way, where it is like, if people are going to potentially <i>use</i> this for something...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: ...Then I'd prefer to be as, like, truthful.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know if that makes any sense. But, like, as forthcoming — [slaps surface] as, like — as open as I could be and as, like, full-picture. I don't know. That was, like, always my thought about it.
THERAPIST: Hmm, really interesting.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. [Clears throat] Huhhh. [Sighs] [Shifts in seat] I'm going to go — try to go for my first run in over a week today. I hurt my leg. I broke my pinky toe?
THERAPIST: Ohhh.
CLIENT: And then I ran on it. That — remember that run that was, like, my best run? [00:43:00]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: That was right after it [chuckles] — like two days later. And then I ran again a few days later, and it was just like <i>screaming</i> pain up through my leg. [Clucks] [Whispers] I don't think that was the day — [speaks up] — so I took last week off.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: And then I was — you know, now I'm just feeling like I really need to go for a run.
THERAPIST: You healed quickly.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Hopefully. [Slaps surface] I don't know. We'll see. I'm going to take it easy. I — I tend to be a little hard on myself if I can't run the full run.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: But [pauses] we'll see. [Sniffles] I'm going to try not to do that. [Clucks]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: [Sighs] Huhh. I had to put a swimsuit on for the first time yesterday in a very long time, and it wasn't, like, a cute look. So — but I was able to just not really take it that seriously. It was, you know — I haven't been eating well. I didn't — oh — it definitely was, like, "Whoa!" [chuckles]. But I didn't get nearly as upset as I would have gotten before. [00:44:12]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So [chuckles] go for a run and — I don't know.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel both emotionally stronger and nervous.
CLIENT: Yeah, good summary. [Chuckles] Absolutely right. That — uh, that would definitely sum me up. I don't know if my nervousness is ever going to go away. I don't — I think that is just part of my character. I think that I was born with a little bit of that. [Clucks] Circumstances didn't help it, but I think that that's just part of me.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Well, I very much believe that people are born with temperaments, and I — you know, I agree that I don't know if you can always change your temperament, but you can develop other parts of you that anchor those things that are vulnerabilities. [00:44:59]
CLIENT: Yeah. [Sniffles] Yeah, so I'll try to do <i>that</i>. [Clucks] And we have our last session on Wednesday.
THERAPIST: We <i>do.</i>
CLIENT: Yep. [Fidgets]
THERAPIST: And then we say goodbye, certainly, at least, for now.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: You can always feel free — and, in fact, I would like you to, but it is up to you...
CLIENT: [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: ...To let me know how you're doing from time to time.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Becomes emotional] [Pulls tissues] I will. [Begins to cry] [Pauses for eight seconds] I'm not very good [whispers] with this kind of thing.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: [Sighs] Are we fully out of time? [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: Well, we're out of time for today.
CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]
THERAPIST: I just want to confirm, um....
CLIENT: Oh, yeah, 10:45 on Wednesday.
THERAPIST: Is it 10:45? Good. OK, that's what I have. I just wanted to double-check.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: OK, very good. I'll see you on Wednesday.
CLIENT: OK, so it is good.
THERAPIST: OK, take care.
CLIENT: Thanks [a lot] (ph).
THERAPIST: Sure. [00:46:00]
[Door opens and closes]
THERAPIST: [Sighs]
[Walks over and turns off microphone]
