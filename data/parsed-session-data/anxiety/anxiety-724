BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Very nice. Not so much?
CLIENT: $3,100 later.
THERAPIST: Ouch.
CLIENT: And now it kind of shakes a little bit every once in a while and there's like a weird smell, so I don't know. Jess suggested the brilliant idea of checking out Zip Car or iCar or [one of these] (ph) cars, but I drive so much it's like, I don't know if that would save me any money. I guess I'd have to wait and see if it would, when the car finally blows up where I'm at. I can imagine once I get past all of these taxes and mortgages and figure out what my monthly responsibilities are if I have enough room to add on a car payment. I probably won't.
[1:01] I know of a guy who's the financial services guy at the bank.
THERAPIST: [inaudible]
CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm going to do a seminar with him at the bank. They've got two branches. And, you know, you see advertising in the elevators and throughout the building, so it at least gets my name out there. And, who knows, I might get an estate planner too, you know. He even had the same gut feeling I had that we could get four or five people to show up to this thing, you know, but I don't know.
[2:04] It's the day before my summary judgment motion. So, I'll have plenty of, you know, anxiousness going on. But, [I'll let it] (ph) distract me a little bit. (pause) Yesterday, once again, I had a lot of anxiety in there and just couldn't stay in the office and get work done even though I had the whole day to really do stuff, I used picking up my car as an excuse to leave, like around 11, noon, somewhere in there. I did the one think I really had to do. You know, I realized looking at the book that I should have submitted my attorney fee affidavit with my summary judgment motion. So I sent that into the court and it came out to like 5 grand and change.
[3:06] It should be more, but, you know, I wasn't going to go back and look at e-mails and see every little communication or whatever, you know. (long pause) But, it's also, the day of the hearing is the day of our big visitor day. We're having a visitor day at E&amp;G.; I'm supposed to bring in ten envelopes. You know, one guy even called me last week which was I guess good. But, I don't know if I have enough time to go from that and get to the hearing on time, you know. Or if I should just blow off the visitor day because I think the motion session starts at two and we finish the (pause), finish the visitor day technically at 1:30, but if we have enough visitors it will probably spill over, you know.
[4:14] So, I don't know what to do. I mean I guess I could show up a little late for the hearing and, you know, still have a chance to argue there. But I would imagine that they would have the smaller, the quicker stuff go first. You know, they wouldn't have the summary judgment motion go first. (pause) So, I might just be a little late for that, (pause) second call up the list. I mean, it isn't that far. And with parking and getting into the courthouse I probably could do it in half an hour, but I'm not going to get out of there at 1:30.
[5:00] So, I don't know, I may just have someone else run the visitor's day and leave early. (pause) Or run part of it then turn it over.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, you've got to be in court you've got to be in court.
CLIENT: Yeah, I just feel like blowing the whole thing off would be a really bad leadership move on my part. So, I can have Tricia, who was last year's president who is now vice president maybe finish up the meeting somehow, you know, some sort of (sighs), I don' t know what the word is (pause). Some transition, you know, but yeah I didn't even do my ten letters yet.
[6:02] I'm going to buggy up to Pembroke and get my ten letters done. I just didn't have it in me. I fell asleep in the afternoon, woke up. You know, I would think that having slept for a couple of hours in the afternoon that I would fall; you know that I'd be awake and have trouble falling asleep. I fell asleep on the couch at like, you know, nine o'clock and I just, I don't know why I'm so tired. (long pause) And, I made a big, big decision in my life. I got a Andover parking permit, so (pause). For one thing, it sucks for the dog because of the lot of walks the dog got were walking to the car, you know. And this morning, even the thought the car was right in front of the house I went and took him out for a walk.
[7:00] So, I may just get used to taking him on more regular walks, which would actually turn out better for him. But, I'm just sick and tired of driving around and, you know. And my, my summer [go on] (ph) is up in June anyways, and (pause) I don't know if I'll have moved back by then. So, I don't know. There's too much, there's too much uncertainty out there. It's probably one of the reasons for my anxiety. (pause) One of the amplifiers, that and coffee. (pause)
[8:01] But, meeting with the Aflac guy this morning, he hosted the coffee at the last chamber event that I went to and I won a $25 gift card so I decided just to get together for coffee or lunch. I forget what the guy looks like, you know, he was the only other suit in the caf√©. And, (pause) I don't know, I'm less likely to be able to send him business than I am the financial services guy. But, I enjoy the estate planning business, that's new; it's all old stuff I've got to finish up. (long pause)
[8:55] The website, I wouldn't call it a failure because it's gotten a lot of business for Jess, but I haven't been getting any business out of it. Maybe that condo, (pause) they may have found me on the website. And, you know, sort of a collateral, this guy I met with said I had a nice website. (pause) So, I don't know. I feel bad and I'm going to leave here, hopefully get into Pembroke by like 8:30 and get about a half hour to whip out ten letters. I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it. (long pause) We'll see (sighs).
[9:58] It's just, I knew, I knew if I would just do it, just get the, find the names, you know. It will take me a half hour to print them out. But, I just don't know why, I just can't motivate myself to do stuff. If, you know, if this was something that absolutely had to be done and I didn't do it, and it's going to set a crappy example if I don't walk in there with ten envelopes, you know. (long pause)
My mom called. She's coming to town. She's asking me where the cheap hotels are, you know. She wouldn't get the joke if I said Springfield.
[10:51] She's like, "Are there any cheap hotels near you?" Well, there's two Holiday Inns. There's one right next to the projects and there's one in East Andover that's kind of next to the Twin City Plaza. You know, which, I don't know how much those places are. She wants to come over Memorial Day. (long pause) That [inaudible] having no radio in my car, it was nice having a loaner. [inaudible] (sighs) (long pause)
THERAPIST: So, (pause) do you know what was making you so anxious that it was hard to work yesterday? [12:01]
CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, I think it's (pause), since I did the affidavit and sent it off that, I don't know, because I like, I had the meeting and then I did the affidavit and that was enough work for the day. You know, just wanted to kind of go home and sleep. And as I'm driving home I remembered about the envelopes, the letters. And, I don't know, it's not like it's, the anxiety yesterday wasn't as bad as it has been (long pause).
[13:00] It really sucks about the $3,100 for the car. I had to ask my parents for 1,500 for the car. And right now I'm spending all the money for the past tickets. So I'm supposed to have a closing with the bank, I don't know when the hell that's supposed to happen. Just no other business coming through the door, you know. (long pause)
[14:03] I don't know if I'm so tired because I'm getting up early every day this week; semi-early. I get to sleep in tomorrow. (long pause) I may have to pick up Ian from school today which means that the work I'm supposed to be doing I can barely do. Most rational people would do it when they got home and I, I just can't. Once I hit the apartment I'm, I haven't been bringing my laptop home. I've been leaving it in the office. I've been checking access through home. I've got a desktop that's really slow, but I can, you know, I can go to my PC I can access. And I kind of joked with myself that I would do the letters that way, that I would at least get the addresses done.
[15:04] (long pause) I don't know when the ten day extension is for the inspection on the condo. I'm kind of hoping the guy backs out. (pause) I don't know what I'd do in September. (pause) (sighs) I don't know what people do; I don't know how people get business. You know, what do they do when they're in a situation like I'm in where's there's just, there's no business coming through the door.
[16:08] You know, I'm doing that housing court mediation stuff which would be good training for me, but, you know, I don't have any landlord-tenant stuff walking through the door. It's like, you know, I don't know what else I need to be doing to attract business. You know, the E&G; group is small and (long pause) I haven't seen anything in a while from the mortgage guy. Hopefully on the 19th, when the new program goes into effect where you don't, when the value of your house isn't important, that that'll be a little mini-boom. That's all I can kind of bank on.
[17:13] (long pause) It's like all of, all of the things that I can be doing take time. You know, there's no instant... (pause) Jess seems to be getting new clients all the time, but that doesn't help me out, you know. (long pause)
[18:00] For some reason I thought it was today, but next week is the appointment with the dog. I don't know how I'm going to pay for that. The money's just not there after this car fiasco. (long pause) It's like I'm almost better having not done any work and finding some other way to get around. And I drive a lot. Today I'm going to drive to Pembroke and then to Wareham, then probably back to Pembroke. (pause) Maybe to one of the things I need to do.
[19:02] Oh fuck, I just remembered this guy's file I need to review. That's in Plymouth. Maybe I can do what I need to do in Pembroke and then go to Plymouth and finish up. (pause) You know, I kind of want to spend time with the kids though. It's like (pause), I don't know.
THERAPIST: You sound pretty despairing.
CLIENT: Is that new?
THERAPIST: No, not really. Maybe a little more today than other days. (long pause) [19:56]
CLIENT: I had pulled up all the old invoices from the attorney I've been doing titles for and sent him an e-mail with it and he said, "Oh, I'm writing a check right away." I haven't gotten a check from him. At least, I mean I've gotten checks from him for the new stuff, but this old stuff I haven't and I don't know why, but I feel uncomfortable, you know, saying, did the check get lost in the mail? (pause) He probably just forgot about it. Which reminds me, I've got a title to do for them and I've got to go to the registry tomorrow. I keep feeling like there's something I had to do on Friday and that's it. I should tell Candy to remind me, the only one who really wants to help me out. [21:11]
THERAPIST: Candy?
CLIENT: Yeah (pause). What did I ask her for? I asked her for a FedEx office and she brought up all throughout the state, you know. There's none really located in the suburbs. They're all kind of in metro areas. I ended up coming to this one down in [inaudible] (ph) I think. That was weeks ago. (long pause)
[21:58] I still haven't started exercising. (long pause) I'm a procrastinator. You know, February was national procrastination month? I put it off until March (laughs). (long pause) (sighs) It's like I think of what else I could have done differently; put myself in a different position. You know, on the first firm job I had they were going to offer me a full time associate job. I quit before they could do that.
[23:00] For health reasons, but I don't know if that was really it, you know, my Crohn's.
THERAPIST: Because of the Crohn's?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because of the stress?
CLIENT: Yeah. I was having active Crohn's at that point. At least I thought I was. My stomach has been bothering me a lot lately and I've been wondering if that's Crohn's or just drinking a lot of coffee and, you know, more of my system being fucked up, eating a lot of vegetables. I have to find ways to get protein in my body. Especially with [Handball] (ph) coming up. I had two hot dogs after my salad last night. [23:51]
They were the good kind of hot dogs though. Uncured, no nitrates or [inaudible] added. But it's beef. Not the survey...I can't think. A study came about red meat and how bad it is for you. [24:16]
THERAPIST: Oh really?
CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) I don't know, having a ham sandwich in the afternoon is going to be enough protein for, you know. I feel like I've lost all of my upper muscle tone. I haven't been doing anything, but I have a feeling that they're not getting as much protein as they usually do. Something [inaudible].
[24:55] I mean, I try to eat better once in a while. Greek yogurt has a lot of protein, soy milk, cashew cereal (pause), I don't know. (pause) Maybe I should be buying chicken. It's like I'm running out of food, you know. It's like I bought enough food for the week, but now I'm running out again and I don't know that I have the money to go to the grocery store. I've got a couple of checks at the office, small ones. But, I'm really worried about having enough money for the football tickets. Because at the same time I've got pay for health insurance and (long pause).
[26:05] I don't know that Jess's going to build enough hours to cover, you know the money I've put out for her like her rent, and her malpractice insurance. Right there is her half of the health insurance that she would need to pay me. I have to cover my half too. And (long pause) I've got one thing closing at the end of the month and it's kind of driving me crazy because we still haven't finished the purchase and sale agreement. And I sent the guy an e-mail yesterday and never heard back.
[26:57] It's like these people are all using, you know, big firms [inaudible] residential deal in Swanson(sp). It's like 388,000, which for Swanson is pretty low. They're going to rehab the whole house. So, (sighs) it's one more thing I've got to deal with today. (pause) I feel like I've got to get to the office and get some of these letters done. Meet with the Aflac guy at 9:30 and if I can finish up at 10:30 I still have time to go do more letters, you know. It's good that I don't have to leave [inaudible at 27:52] until 11:15, 11:30.
[27:58] It's hard to, you know if you're really clicking, you know an hour doesn't seem like a lot of time. So, I may tell him that I've got to leave at 10:30. (long pause)
THERAPIST: Is that reasonable?
CLIENT: I don't want to drive my car a little gentler up to Pembroke and not fly up the 80. New Subaru's are fast. Yeah, I got back into my car and was like, come on, let's go. [28:58]
THERAPIST: There's more power in the motor with the newer's.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's a 2012 and you stepped on the gas and you went. My car, you step on the gas and you wait, you wait, you wait.
THERAPIST: Zero to sixty [inaudible].
CLIENT: Yeah. I went and got like a four cylinder, so, but they're still using the box for engines so I don't know if they've switched them up enough to make them faster, more responsive. The engines I think are made by Porsche. (long pause) I don't know why I think that. Someone must have told me that at some point. Don't quote me on that. (long pause)
[30:00] Jess's going into court today on a guy who already owed her $700 and gave her a $350 retainer postdated by a week. And she's going into court with him today. It's like she's not going to see any of this money. And you know I used to do that where I'd start working for people without a retainer, but I've gotten myself to at least ask for $1,500, 2,000 depending on what it is. I may not get any money after that, but [inaudible] that much money. The condo I'm in litigation with, they've already paid me $2,000 so...
THERAPIST: That's great. [30:55]
CLIENT: You know... (sighs) (long pause) Excuse me. (long pause) The realtor at E&G; called me at like eight o'clock last night. I was in the middle of something. Oh yeah, I was putting my hot dogs on the buns and she didn't leave a voice-mail. The deal she's supposed to have in May may be dying.
[31:58] I think she was calling to tell that it was dead, but call at eight o'clock at night, leave no voice-mail, send no e-mail, you know. I should have just called her back, but I was tired. I meet with Candy, the [inaudible] (ph) Saturday morning. We were supposed to meet yesterday, but she had to change her appointment. My choices were the morning or the afternoon, like 5:30 on Saturday. I've got the big swan (ph) banquet this weekend. Yeah. It's potluck so I've got to go to the grocery store and get cheese and crackers. I don't know what else to bring, you know. I'm not going to make anything. It's a Yankee swap where we have a bunch of swan related items in the Yankee swap and I haven't even...I think I just may not participate. [33:08]
THERAPIST: You could bake cookies, Cameron.
CLIENT: Swan cookies.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Can you bake cookies?
THERAPIST: It's pretty easy.
CLIENT: I would have to buy cookie mix, wouldn't I? And how do I get the swan on the cookie?
THERAPIST: I don't know. I don't know. You could just put the letter S, just make cookies and put the letter S on it or something.
CLIENT: There are some swan beers I might go grab; beer that's swan related. [34:02]
THERAPIST: You could put, like some chocolate chips in there and say they're hearts.
CLIENT: Or I can go to get the a swan related CD.
THERAPIST: There you go.
CLIENT: Do they still sell CD's?
THERAPIST: I don't know. Actually there's a record store just down the street that just opened up.
CLIENT: Yeah, one just opened up in Union Square.
THERAPIST: Oh really?
CLIENT: It's a new trend. All the young kids want to buy records. Like Phish puts out albums and live albums on record. Like Pearl Jam puts out vinyls. So a lot of bands are... (long pause)
[35:00] I think I might cancel for next Friday. (pause)
THERAPIST: Now remind me, what was the issue next Friday?
CLIENT: I've got a networking event.
THERAPIST: What would be better?<br />
CLIENT: Oh, we rescheduled for Wednesday. So, I don't know. [35:58] (long pause)
THERAPIST: Right. But you said Friday's better.
CLIENT: In the afternoon.
THERAPIST: Right. Yeah I don't have anything in the afternoon. I've got some stuff later in the morning, but that's not helpful.
CLIENT: What time?
THERAPIST: I could do (pause) maybe 9:30
CLIENT: Yeah, that's too early.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I think it only goes from eight to nine. [37:00]
But there's no other really good time. I mean it's going to go longer than that, you know. But any sort of success in meeting people that I would (long pause)...This guy, I think that's all he does is set up networking events at the [inaudible] (ph) Center. Interesting business, he just sells advertising for his networking magazine. Because these are free networking events so you have to rent he space, pay for the coffee and whatever. So, they had 150 people at the last one. [37:56]
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: So, it's almost too many people. But my mortgage guy will probably be there so (pause), mortgage kid, he's young. (long pause)
THERAPIST: Well it does sound like you're; this guy has been valuable to you. So this guy has definitely been able to [inaudible].
CLIENT: Forcing myself to, it's like I'm backed into a corner that, you know, I've really got to start going out there and... [39:04]
THERAPIST: I think that's the hardest thing for you to like, sort of boot strap this kind of stuff. When you've got so little coming in, in terms of money, in terms of like support from other people, and yet, you know, you've got to stay motivated.
CLIENT: I've sat down with, you know, mortgage guys and realtors and, you know some financial people in the past. It just, nothing really comes of it. You know really one takes something. I've got to get a couple of these [inaudible] and get a purchase out of it, but you know, just (long pause)...
[39:58] I don't know. (long pause) Jess does zero networking and she's got business coming in, you know. And, I'm not saying I'm networking my ass off, but I'm putting a lot of effort into it.
THERAPIST: Right. Sure.
CLIENT: With three, not including my E&G; meeting, only three sort of one-on-one's this week.
THERAPIST: That's a lot.
CLIENT: And that's a little work. It's not like it's...today's the only day that's kind of stressing me out a little bit because I didn't do my ten letters.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I've got to meet with the guy. He's got my $25 gift card. [41:00]
THERAPIST: Hopefully you'll have time to get some of them done.
CLIENT: I think I'm going to ask him about one of these coffees, you know. There might be some point where, you know, it might be smart for me to do one. (long pause) Just as you know, some of these lawyers have real practices that are so entrenched, you know, that (pause) it just, I don't know. (long pause) [41:57]
THERAPIST: Well, you know, these kind of referrals to like, you and, I'm sure they go through slow periods where...
CLIENT: [inaudible] law offices with overhead, you know. I've got a little bit of overhead, but, you know, payroll and you know, real office space, which means they've the phone, the cable, you know all of these extra. They're able to do it because they've got enough connections and business to at least cover that. I feel like I've just, you know, wasted the last eight, nine years just, I kind of know better than a first year law student coming out of law school, trying to work for themselves. (long pause) [43:00]
THERAPIST: We need to stop now. So, Tuesday and I'll let you know if anything opens up on Friday afternoon.
