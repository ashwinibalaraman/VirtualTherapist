<b>OVERVIEW</b>


The contribution of emotional processes
(Greenberg, 2002), empathy (Bohart &amp;
Greenberg, 1997), and client reflexivity
(Rennie, 1998) to productive experiential
psychotherapeutic outcomes has been well
documented in the psychotherapy practice
and research literature. In contrast, the
importance of client narrative expressionin
particular the narrative disclosure of emotionally
salient, autobiographical memoriesfor
the facilitation of experiential
engagement, emotional arousal, and personal
meaning-making has rarely been
addressed. In this chapter, we hope to fill this
gap in the experiential practice and research
literature.


Specifically, it is our view that clients' disclosure
of emotionally charged personal
narratives is foundational to the emergence
of emotional responses in therapy sessions
and contributes to the concretization of new
meanings in brief experiential psychotherapy.
Moreover, the sharing of emotionally
significant personal memories is central
to the construction of shared contexts of
meaning and understanding between clients
and therapists and the development of a
strong therapeutic bond and alliance. In this
chapter, we will first present a comprehensive
Narrative Process model of therapeutic

[p. <i>88</i>]

<b>THE NARRATIVE PROCESS MODEL</b>


The Narrative Process Model (Angus,
Levitt, &amp; Hardtke, 1999) views narrative
expression as arising out of a dialectical
interplay of autobiographical memory,
emotion, and reflexive meaning-making
processes. While personally significant narratives
are marked by the expression and
evocation of emotions, the significance of
emotions can only be understood when organized
within a narrative framework that
identifies what is felt, about whom, and in
relation to what need or issue. The Narrative
Process Model is in agreement with a dialectical
constructivist view of experiential therapeutic
change. Core assumptions underlying
this model include (a) client agency,
(b) human reflexivity and meaning-making,
(c) the importance of emotion schemes and
emotion processing for the facilitation of second
order or identity change, and (d) the coconstructive
nature of the client-therapist
dialogue. While we are in full agreement with
the basic tenets of a dialectical-constructivist
model (Greenberg &amp; Pascual-Leone, 1995,
1997, 2001), which views emotional processing
and emergent meaning-making processes
as central to the inception of change in
psychotherapy, we also believe that narrative
expression and the disclosure of salient personal
memories are foundational to the
inception of change experiences in experiential
therapy.


According to the Narrative Process Model
of self-change, all forms of successful psychotherapy
involve the articulation, elaboration,
and transformation of the client's life story
(Angus &amp; Hardtke, 1994; Angus, Hardtke, &amp;
Levitt, 1996; Angus et al., 1999). Personal
identity is construed as the coherent integration
of emotionally salient personal narratives,
which either explicitly or implicitly
represent core beliefs about self and others.
The emotional tone of the narrativeanger,
sadness, joy, or fearappears to be one of
the primary ways in which personal memories
and narratives are linked to one another.
Accordingly, implicit emotion themes and
the personal memories they contain become
the lens through which we classify, tell a
story about, and make meaning of our new
interpersonal experiences with others in the
world.


In the Narrative Process Model, therapeutic
change is viewed as entailing a process of
dialectical shifts between narrative storytelling
(external narrative mode), emotional
differentiation (internal narrative mode), and
reflexive meaning-making modes of inquiry.


<b><i>External Narrative Sequences</i></b>


In psychotherapy, it is crucial that clients
remember and articulate real or imagined,
past or recent events to fill in the gaps in the
narrative that may have been forgotten or
never fully acknowledged and therefore not
understood (Angus et al., 1999). This therapeutic
process is represented by the external
narrative mode of the Narrative Processes
Model, which addresses the question of
"what happened?" (Angus &amp; Hardtke,
1994). An external narrative sequence can be
a personal story that is either autobiographical
or nonautobiographical in content.
Recent research findings have established
that 75% of all external sequences, extracted

[p. <i>89</i>]

In addition, external sequences may entail
either a description of a specific event, a general
description of many repeated similar
events, or a composite of many specific
events (Angus et al., 1996). The autobiographical
external provides the client with
the chance to engage in storytelling, to create
a visually rich picture for the therapist by
means of verbally descriptive and specific
details of life experiences and events
(Angus et al., 1999). In fact, the description
of "what happened" might also entail
nonautobiographical information or chronicles
of factual information or events.


<b><i>Internal Narrative Sequences</i></b>


Clients also need to be fully engaged in the
lived experience of an event in order to bring
to awareness and fully articulate tacit feelings
and emotions. This is achieved when both
the therapist and client engage in the detailed
unfolding and exploration of associated sensations
and emotions, which can emerge in
the retelling of an autobiographical memory.
The internal narrative process mode is associated
with this process and entails the
description and elaboration of subjective
feelings, reactions, and emotions connected
with an event and addresses the question of
"what was felt?" during the event. In addition,
the internal narrative mode addresses
what was felt during the therapy session in
relation to the event.


The function of the internal mode of
inquiry for clients is to share with the therapist
their reexperienced feelings and emotions
that are associated with the retelling of
a particular event (external mode) or to
articulate newly emerging feelings and emotions
occurring during the therapy hour
(Angus et al., 1999). Research supports the
notion that emotional disclosure regarding
traumatic events can result in positive
immunological and psychological effects for
survivors (Harber &amp; Pennebaker, 1992;
Pennebaker &amp; Seagal, 1999).


<b><i>Reflexive Narrative Sequences</i></b>


The final goal of productive therapy
involves the reflexive analysis of articulated
experiences, which often leads to the construction
of new meanings and perspectives
on situations and can result in a recon
structed narrative. This reconstructed narrative
may either support or challenge the
implicit beliefs about self and others that
contribute to the client's life story or
<i>macronarrative</i> (Hardtke, 1996). The reflexive
narrative mode represents this therapeutic
process and is characterized as the reflexive
analyses of events and subjective feelings.
Therefore, this narrative process mode
addresses the question of "what does it
mean?" in relation to what happened or
what was felt during an event.


Each of the narrative process modes of
inquiry has a corresponding therapeutic goal:
(a) to help clients to fill in the gaps of what
has been forgotten or never fully acknowledged
and, hence, understood; (b) to help
clients to "re-live" the event and to better
articulate and understand it, perhaps for the
first time; and (c) to aid the client in forming
new understandings about the self and
others. Together, the three narrative modes
of inquiry and their accompanying therapeutic
goals are vital and contribute to the
development of more coherent, emotionally
differentiated personal narratives, which provide
individuals with a greater understanding
of themselves and their interactions with
others. In essence, the narrative process
modes are viewed as essential components of
a distinctive mode of human meaning-making,
which constructs, maintains, and, when
needed, revises our sense of self in the world.


The developmental psychologist Jerome
Bruner (1986,1990) points out that narrative

[p. <i>90</i>]

To conduct an empirical investigation of
narrative processes in psychotherapy, a
systematic method for the identification of
therapy discourse parameters associated
with narrativeprocessing modes was developed
(Angus &amp; Hardtke, 1994; Angus et al.,
1999). The Narrative Processes Coding
System (NPCS) and revised manual
(Angus et al., 1996) has evolved from the
Narrative Process Model and was designed
for application to psychotherapy transcripts.
The NPCS provides researchers with a rational,
systematic method of segmenting therapy
transcripts, regardless of therapeutic
modality. The NPCS has demonstrated both
construct validity and good levels of interrater
agreement in a series of recent psychotherapy
process studies (Angus &amp;
Hardtke, 1994; Angus et al., 1999; Gonalves,
Korman, &amp; Angus, 2000; Gonalves,
Machado, Korman, &amp; Angus, 2002; Hardtke,
Levitt, &amp; Angus, in press; Levitt &amp; Angus,
2000; Levitt, Korman, &amp; Angus, 2000; Levitt,
Korman, Angus, &amp; Hardtke, 1997).


The NPCS entails a two-step process that
enables the researcher to (a) reliably subdivide
and characterize therapy session
transcripts into topic segments according
to content shifts in verbal dialogue and
(b) further subdivide and characterize these
topic segments in terms of one of three
narrativeprocess mode types. The narrative
types are (a) External Narrative Process
Sequences, which include descriptions of
events (past, present, and/or future; actual or
imagined); (b) Internal Narrative Process
Sequences, which include a subjective/
experiential description of experience; and
(c) Reflexive Narrative Process Sequences,
which entail recursive questioning and meaning-making
processes in relation to beliefs,
actions, and emotions represented in current,
past, and/or future events. The NPCS provides
an empirical method for identifying the
occurrence of the three narrative process
modes as well as the dialectical shifts
between modes, as they occur over time and
across sessions. Accordingly, the Narrative
Process Model and NPCS can be used as a

[p. <i>91</i>]

Over the past 5 years, we have had the
opportunity to intensively investigate narrative
process modes and shifts in the context of
12 full case analyses of clients undergoing
brief process experiential therapy treatment
for depression (Angus et al., 1999) and unfinished
business (Angus &amp; Bouffard, 2002).
The findings emerging from this extended
inquiry into narrative, emotion, and meaning-making
processes will now be presented, with
clinical examples for key findings.


<b>NARRATIVE
PROCESSES AND PROCESS
EXPERIENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY</b>


Process experiential psychotherapy is a distinctive,
emotion-focused, constructivist therapy
rooted in an integration of both gestalt
(Perls, 1973) and client-centered (Rogers,
1951) psychotherapy approaches. As such, it
shares a common faith in humanity's innate
capacity for self-reflective awareness and for
movement toward positive growth and self-development
(Greenberg et al., 1993). While
the gestalt approach provides therapists with
a set of interventions designed to evoke problematic
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, the
client-centered approach encourages therapists
to adopt an empathie, prizing (positive,
accepting), and genuine attunement to the
client's emotionally salient experiences.


To build a strong therapeutic alliance,
process experiential therapists first establish
a secure, empathic relationship with their
clients. Once established, gestalt techniques
are introduced to facilitate the resolution of
longstanding problems in living. The objective
of the therapy is to access and restructure
habitual maladaptive emotional states
worthlessness, anxious dependence, powerlessness,
abandonment, and invalidationthat
are viewed as the source of psychological
distress such as depression (Greenberg,
Watson, &amp; Goldman, 1998). Through the
therapeutic process, adaptive emotions are
accessed to transform maladaptive emotions
and to organize the person for adaptive
responses. This process of changing emotion
is thought to work by the use of specific therapeutic
techniques that help stimulate
arousal of emotion and its processing.


In two-chair work, clients articulate their
experience or perception of an event from
two different viewpoints: the critical self and
the experiencing self. The critical self is
instructed to express harsh criticisms or negative
self-statements to the experiencing self
to evoke a strong emotional response or reaction.
Reactions such as hopelessness, fear, or
shame are then transformed by accessing primary
emotions, such as sadness in response
to loss or anger in response to violation.
When more primary emotions are activated,
clients are encouraged to combat the negative
cognitions with these and their associated
needs. This leads to a softening of the
harsh criticism and a negotiation and integration
of the two previously disparate
aspects of self (Greenberg et al., 1993).


Unfinished business is a gestalt therapy
term that signifies the presence of longstanding,
unresolved relationship concerns,
which are often accompanied by feelings of
burden and resentment. Empty chair work
for unfinished business involves emotional
expression of previously suppressed primary
emotion, such as hurt and anger toward the
imaginary significant other in the chair. This
intervention leads to an expression of unmet
needs. Clients take the perspective of the other
at this point, which leads to the accessing of a
new, often more positive view of the other.
The resolution involves accepting and forgiving
the other or, in cases of abuse, holding the
other accountable for his or her actions.


Greenberg (2002) states that a central
task for experiential psychotherapists is the

[p. <i>92</i>]

An intensive analysis of more than 18
therapy dyads and 200 therapy sessions,
drawn from process experiential therapy
clients undergoing treatment for depression
and unfinished business make it clear that
clients specialize in the narration and disclosure
of salient personal memories in their
therapy sessions. In the context of sessions
drawn from six brief process experiential
therapy dyads undergoing treatment for
depression (Greenberg &amp; Angus, 1995),
Rotondi-Trevisan (2002) found that 74% of
the external narrative sequences, or 668
external sequences, met criteria for personal
autobiographical memory narrative (Singer
&amp; Moffitt, 1992). Stated another way,
clients disclosed six autobiographical memories,
on average, to their therapists in the
context of process experiential treatment
sessions.


These findings support the notion that it is
through the telling of personal stories that we
show ourselves to others and construct
shared understandings with engaged listeners.
Moreover, our intensive narrativeprocess
analyses indicate that therapists'
attunement to clients' autobiographical
memory narratives serves two key functions
in a successful experiential therapy relationship:
(a) the development of a strong therapeutic
alliance and (b) the evocation and
differentiation of emotion processes for the
articulation of new meanings and perspectives
on self. We will now provide a fuller
description of each of these key contributions
in the context of clinical examples drawn
from process experiential therapy sessions.


<b><i>Narrative Expression
and the Therapeutic Alliance</i></b>


Clients use the description of vivid autobiographical
memories to tell their stories to
therapists and to be more fully understood.
Autobiographical memory storytelling facilitates
the development of a strong, trusting
therapeutic bond in which both client and
therapist co-create a sense of shared experiencing,
knowing, and interpersonal understanding.
The therapist's capacity to attend
empathically to a client's key concerns, as
conveyed in personal stories, contributes to
an early development of a strong, secure
therapeutic alliance by instilling a sense of
basic trust in the client toward the therapist.
Experiential therapists, in turn, invite their
clients to affectively and reflexively explore
and expand on these vivid memories in the
therapy sessions. New meanings that emerge
from the exploration of emotion and meaning
schemes are then concretized by clients in
the context of telling new stories about life
experiences, stories that represent new ways
of seeing or interacting with others.


In the following sequences, the process
experiential therapist empathically supports

[p. <i>93</i>]

<b>Client</b>


I just can't you know, because
the images of certain things like
that are so clear in my mind and
it was so long ago <i>[shift to external
narrative mode and the
description of a single event
memory]</i> And I said that to my
sister yesterday, that night is so
clear to me


<b>Therapist</b>


the night she died


<b>Client</b>


the night she killed herself. It's so
clear, I can remember everything


<b>Therapist</b>


just like it happened yesterday


<b>Client</b>


and I remember <i>[shift to a narrative
of childhood]</i> and it sort of
came into clear focus of me as a
kid, and I hate it, I mean I hate it.
<i>[shift to internal/emotional differentiation]</i>
I remember the
night that my mother died, that's
what it was like <i>[emergence of
single-event narrative of suicide
scene and external shift/landscape
of action]</i> I was walking
and my brother and sister, my
sister was supposed to be
babysitting my brother in the
house, and um, it was quiet and
I thought they were waiting to
jump out and go "boo!" you
know? kid's stuff


<b>Therapist</b>


mm-hm.


<b>Client</b>


so I tiptoe, tiptoe up the sidewalk
and open the front door very
carefully and listen, still nothing,
just the sound in my eardrums
<i>[shift to internal/landscape of
consciousness]</i>


<b>Therapist</b>


this deafening silence <i>[therapist's
evocative reflection of internal
experience]</i>


<b>Client</b>


so quiet, and I'm thinking <i>[shift
to reflexive/landscape of consciousness]</i>
this is really berserk,
really crazy, because usually by
now they've jumped out and
scared the living daylights out of
me and we've all laughed


<b>Therapist</b>


mm


<b>Client</b>


and punched each other or whatever
kids do. And I remember
walking in <i>[shift to external]</i> and
still nothing, and thinking this is
really funny, <i>[shift to reflexive/
landscape of consciousness]</i> and
I took my boots off and I went
creeping down into the kitchen
and I saw my mother's foot first
and<i>[shift to internal]</i> I was in
absolute shock and not knowing
what to do.


<b>Therapist</b>


and your heart almost stopped
<i>[therapist's evocative elaboration
of client internal experiencing]</i>


<b>Client</b>


<i>[shift to external narrative mode]</i>
and I started shouting because I
thought my sister was supposed
to be there and I started screaming
for my sister and then I

[p. <i>94</i>]

<b>Therapist</b>


sure, sure


<b>Client</b>


it felt like 10 hours, I'm sure it
was a minute but it seemed like
10 hours.


<b>Therapist</b>


so then you walked in and saw
what had actually happened
<i>[therapist invites a return to the
differentiation of the suicide
scene and shift to external/landscape
of action]</i>


<b>Client</b>


I tried waking her up, I thought
she might just have, you know


<b>Therapist</b>


who knows as a child


<b>Client</b>


and I'm just shaking her and
shaking her and trying to wake
her up, and thinking <i>[shift to
reflexive/landscape of consciousness]</i>
you know, oh god, what do
I do, who do I call, what do I do


<b>Therapist</b>


mm


<b>Client</b>


so the first thing I did, <i>[shift back
to external/landscape of action]</i> I
called my aunt she came over
with my sister because of course
I said,I don't know what I
said, I have no idea and of course
when she came in <i>[shift to reflexive/landscape
of consciousness]</i>
my heart also goes out to her
because I can't imagine an adult,
myself now walking in on a
situation like thatwith your
family.


<b>Therapist</b>


yeah.


In this sequence, both the client and therapist
collaborate in a detailed unfolding of a
trauma scene, in the context of a narrative
description that provides a clear beginning,
middle, and end to the event. In addition, a
clear scene and setting is provided, along with
the internal experiences of both the protagonist
and significant others (the aunt) involved
in the event. For the first time, a coherent narrative
of the trauma memory begins to take
shape for the client. A continual interplay
between external and internal/reflexive narrative
shifts seamlessly interweaves the unfolding
narrative scene with the emotions,
intentions, and expectations that the client
experienced at the time of his mother's suicide.


The following example is also drawn from
a good-outcome therapy dyad and illustrates
how the process experiential therapist helps
the client to access and disclose salient
personal memories:


<b>Client</b>


and <i>[external narrative shift]</i>
especially in the springin
around May of this year I was
really um thinking, the memories
were flooding back from 20
years ago in the spring when I
left home, and I first discovered I
was pregnant.


<b>Therapist</b>


I see.


<b>Client</b>


Really, the weatherthe weather
in the springtime of this year
brought back memories of what
happened in May and April
of '87.


<b>Therapist</b>


Oh I see, uh-huh, is there anything
about it that you can sort
of recapture and tell me

[p. <i>95</i>]

<b>Client</b>


uh


<b>Therapist</b>


what specifically kinds of memories
came back?


<b>Client</b>


I just remember pulling together
pulling together that
wedding, and all the running
around we did to pull it together
in 2 weeks.


In another example drawn from the same
therapy dyad, the therapist probes for the
disclosure of a specific autobiographical
memory narrative,


<b>Therapist</b>


Uh-huh. So see if any specific
memory comes up of any, of a
time when you really felt


<b>Client</b>


uh,oh yes


<b>Therapist</b>


uh-huh


<b>Client</b>


I took, I remember the time
when I called home. I called ... I
called my mother's home just to
hear whoever's voice answered. I
did it four or five times and then
I would just hang up


<b>Therapist</b>


hm


<b>Client</b>


just to hear [her family name],
just to get in touch with that
house that seemed so far away
and gone and lost.


The client responds to the therapist's
request for a memory with a narrative that
conveys the sense of the client's poignant
longing for the family that she had to leave
behind"lost"when she chose to leave
home, as a teenager, to live with the father of
her newborn baby. It is clear that in all of
these examples, the therapist is actively
encouraging the client to shift to the recollection
of emotionally significant personal
memories and to describe these experiences
to the therapist.


<b><i>Narrative Processes and
Emotional Meaning Making</i></b>


Process experiential therapists focus on
their clients' retelling of emotionally salient
autobiographical memory narratives, or
external narrative sequences, to enable
clients to further differentiate emotions that
are experienced during the retelling of the
personal memory. Based on the process experiential
model, it is clear that a key therapist
task is the active facilitation of client processing
shifts toward the differentiation and
elaboration of emotional experiences, internal
narrative mode.


One of the unique insights generated by
the NPCS to date has been the discovery that
the transition from storytelling to emotional
differentiation was most successful when it
was first preceded by the client's active
exploration of his or her own experiential
responses to the narrative, in the context of a
reflexive inquiry mode. Specifically, process
experiential therapists invite clients to shift
from external narrative modes to reflexive
and internal narrative modes to elaborate the
landscape of consciousness and facilitate
emotional meaning-making and new perspectives
on self and others in the world. In
turn, the differentiation and narrative organization
of painful emotion enables the client
to reflexively explore and symbolize emergent
meanings of distress, trauma, and loss.


In her intensive case analysis of three
good-outcome and three poor-outcome process
experiential therapy dyads, Lewin
(2001) found that reflexive to internal mode
shifts made up almost a third (30%) of all
narrative process mode shifts undertaken by
therapists involved in the good-outcome
therapy relationships. In contrast, pooroutcome
therapists initiated significantly fewer
to internal mode shifts (16.75%). In
essence, it appeared that the therapist's
specific focus on emotional meanings, in the
context of the client's self-reflections, helped

[p. <i>96</i>]

The following excerpt from one good-outcome
process experiential therapy dyad
illustrates this process of empathie attunement,
reflexive meaning making, and emotional
differentiation in the context of salient
personal memories.


<b>Client</b>


<i>[external narrative sequence]</i>
Rob's brother Peter was my
friend initially and we used to
spend a lot of time together at
the newspaper....most of the
reason that I'm unablethat I
am terrified of running into Rob
in front of other people is
because I cannot sit there and be
quiet but I cannot say things in
front of Peter that would incur
his wrath at all...<i>[shift to
reflexive narrative sequence]</i> like
just the idea of him not liking me
for some reasonand I have yet
to figure this outis extremely
upsetting to me and has been for
a long time....<i>[shift to new
relational context associated
with similar feelings]</i> and it is
becoming that way with Mark
too...my biggest problem with
Mark is everything I can see he's
a person that I could love and
respect but I have this nagging
doubt about me


<b>Therapist</b>


this is an inner doubt within
you. ... <i>[empathie reflection/
reflexive mode]</i>


<b>Client</b>


yeah. ... that it's all put on, that
I'm being lied to all over again
because ultimately the way I feel,
what happens with Mark is I feel
emotion toward him...<i>[shift to
internal mode]</i> just like different
emotions but up until about a
week ago, like friendship.


<b>Therapist</b>


Is that kind of like...a feeling
of warmth? <i>[empathic conjectional
differentiating emotional
experience/internal mode]</i>


<b>Client</b>


Exactly! I was about to say a
trust, a warmth ... just this
complete contentment


<b>Therapist</b>


that feels really good inside


<b>Client</b>


exactly and um it's followed by
this gut-wrenching, sick feeling
of dread <i>[shift to reflexive mode]</i>
because the only other person in
the last 4 years that has made me
feel that way was Raoul and it
turned out to be exactly opposite
to everything that was really
going on. ... like when I
thought he most liked me, and
most accepted me for who I was,
it was a huge act.


In this excerpt, both client and therapist
participate in a collaborative differentiation
of implicit emotions and meanings (Bruner's
notion of the narrative landscape of consciousness)
that suffuse problematic events
(the landscape of action) unfolding in intimate
relationships. Process experiential therapists
enable clients to access and symbolize
implicit emotion schemes and bring new
understandings to the actions of self and
others through or by means of the facilitation
of reflexive and internal narrative process
shifts. It should be noted, however, that this
facilitation process was most successful when
preceded by the client's active self-exploration
of his or her own heightened experiential
arousal, evoked by either the retelling of

[p. <i>97</i>]

Process experiential therapists also focus
on client descriptions of emotionally salient
autobiographical memory narratives, or external
narrative sequences, for the assessment of
emotion process markers such as heightened
emotional arousal and the introduction of
chairing interventions. In the case of emotional
harm, empty chair interventions are
designed to help clients undertake an experiential
entry into the internal world or perspective
of the significant other with whom they
have experienced relationship problems.


In the quest for emotional understanding, a
key question that will need to be addressed is
the intentions of the person whose actions
caused the client such emotional pain: "Why
did they hurt me?" The issue of intention goes
directly to fundamental issues of trust and
attachment and the belief that others are trustworthy
and loving. When the actions of loved
ones cause us emotional pain, we are often left
confused and unable to meaningfully integrate
feelings of anger, betrayal, fearfulness, and
sadness. Central to the quest for understanding
is the construction of a new, emotionally
coherent account that integrates the narrative
landscape of actionwhat happenedwith a
more differentiated and rich account of the
narrative landscape of consciousness, in which
the questions of "what do I feel?" and "what
does it mean?" are more fully addressed.


The following example of an empty-chair
intervention, drawn from the same therapy
dyad as the first excerpt, demonstrates the
important role that the process experiential
therapist's empathic reflections, selective
questions, and suggestions play in helping
the client to further articulate the landscape
of consciousness (emotions and meanings) in
relation to experiences of trauma and loss.
The therapist's responses help scaffold the
client's reflexive processing of implicit meanings
attendant to the personal memory as
well as to differentiate new emotional
responses emerging from his active engagement
in his inner experiential world. In this
sequence, the therapist first has the client
imaginatively place his mother, who committed
suicide when he was an adolescent, in an
empty chair and then asks the client to
describe the trauma scene (an external narrative
shift) followed by an encouragement to
elaborate felt emotions (an internal narrative
mode). The client, in turn, shifts back and
forth between describing the remembered
suicidal scene and articulating felt emotions
evoked by the terrifying images. In this therapeutic
dance, the therapist empathically follows
the client's lead and facilitates the
expression of painful emotions and deep
fears. Finally, the client shifts to a reflexive
questioning mode at the end of the sequence
in an attempt to bring understanding to this
trauma experience.

A primary goal of process experiential
task interventionssuch as two-chair and
empty chair tasksis the heightening of
client emotional arousal to facilitate shifts in
client emotional processes. Emotion shifts
can be in the form of movement from maladaptive
secondary emotions to more primary
adaptive emotional responses or the
accessing of new adaptive emotional
responses in the context of personal memory
narratives. Experiencing new and sometimes
contradictory emotional responses in the
context of past life events can lead to significant
shifts in the intentions, hopes, beliefs,
wishes, and feelings we attribute to the
actions of self and others. At these moments,
we see ourselves and others in a new light
and are impelled to construct a new, emotionally
coherent narrative that accounts for
what happened and why it occurred, what
was felt, in relation to whom, about what
need or issue. It is our contention that emotions
are "understood," and have personal
meaning, when they are organized within a
narrative framework that identifies what is
felt, about whom, and in relation to what
need or issue.


In contrast to the therapists engaged in
good-outcome process experiential therapy,
Lewin (2001) found that poor-outcome therapists
were twice as likely to try to initiate
shifts to internal emotion-focused modes
directly from external narrative sequences.
Similarly, poor-outcome clients initiated
more internal to external narrative shifts

[p. <i>99</i>]

In the context of intensively analyzing the
following poor-outcome process experiential
therapy dyad, Lewin found that most of the
client's emotional experiences involved the
therapist either (a) doing the majority of
the emotional processing or (b) focusing
more on the client's bodily sensations rather
than her inner psychological state. The client
also appeared to play a more passive role
than good-outcome clients when exploring
her feelings and preferred to focus on bodily
sensations rather than discussing her emotions.
The following excerpt, taken from
Session 4, highlights the client's focus on her
bodily sensations as she describes how she
feels out of breath a lot of the time.


<b>Client</b>


Yeah yeah. I find that I'm, I'm ah
I feel short of breath a lot. <i>[shift
to internal narrative sequence]</i>


<b>Therapist</b>


Short of breath a lot?


<b>Client</b>


mm-hm. And just panting and
huffing and puffing you know I
<i>[lets out breath]</i> breathing and
yawning and like I can't get
enough air.


<b>Therapist</b>


So it's almost as if you're suffocating
<i>[therapist empathie conjecture/metaphor]</i>


<b>Client</b>


Yeah.


<b>Therapist</b>


So, what's that sense of suffocating ...?
<i>[therapist invites client
to differentiate experiential felt
sense]</i>


<b>Client</b>


Well, I'll pick up the phone, I can
be sitting.... <i>[client shift away
from internal narrative sequence
to an externall storytelling narrative
sequence]</i>


It is of interest to note the client's movement
away from focusing on her internal
experiencing and back to storytelling rather
than reflection, despite the therapist's evocative
metaphoric representation of the client's
felt distress. The preceding excerpt also suggests
that it is not only the activation of emotional
schemes but the client's reflexive
engagement with and movement into the
elaboration of personal meanings connected
with emotionally charged events that is
crucial for therapeutic change.


<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>


In conclusion, it appears that clients' disclosures
of personal stories, and the subsequent
elaboration of the dual landscapes of narrative
action and consciousness, are fundamental
to the facilitation of significant client
shifts and personal change in process experiential
psychotherapy. Findings emerging
from the intensive empirical analyses of productive
process experiential sessions indicate
that therapists explicitly focus on strategies
that enable clients to dwell in and articulate
more fully key components of the narrative
landscape of consciousness. These components
included the differentiation of adaptive
emotions, implicit beliefs, hopes, intentions,
and expectations of self and others caught up
in the unfolding events of the narrative landscape
of action.


Less evident in the process experiential
model, but clearly present in good-outcome
therapy sessions, was therapists' active facilitation
of clients' disclosures of emotionally salient
personal memories for the purpose of meaning-making
and emotional differentiation. In addition,
the disclosure of personal stories seems to
be the fundamental means by which clients

[p. <i>100</i>]

In conclusion, in the context of intensively
exploring the interplay of narrative, emotion,
and meaning-making modes in productive
therapy sessions, a more differentiated understanding
of the essential contributions of both
emotion and narrative processes for self-change
has emerged. These findings would
appear to have important implications for
both the theory and practice of experiential
psychotherapy, and we are looking forward
to participating in the ongoing evolution of
experiential therapy practice and research.
