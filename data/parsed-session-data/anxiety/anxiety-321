Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the
leading cause of death in most
industrialized nations, including the
United States, where it is responsible for
approximately 450,000 deaths each year
(American Heart Association, 2004). In the
current U.S. population of healthy 40-year-old
adults, approximately one third of the
women and nearly one half of the men will
develop CHD at some point in their life.
Each year in the United States, individuals
experience approximately 1 million initial or
recurrent coronary events, with associated
annual costs in direct medical care, disability,
and lost productivity exceeding $100 billion
(American Heart Association, 2004). Obviously,
CHD represents a critically important
health problem.


Approaches to the prevention and management
of CHD have been guided by evidence
of the role of modifiable risk factors.
For example, smoking, high levels of cholesterol
in the blood, high blood pressure, high
blood glucose, obesity, and low levels of regular
physical activity confer increased risk of
CHD; modification of these characteristics
can reduce risk and improve prognosis.
These traditional risk factors, however, even
when combined with unmodifiable CHD
risk factors such as increasing age, male
sex, and a positive family history, provide an
incomplete account of the causal influences
on this disease. A growing body of evidence
indicates that psychosocial characteristics
can confer increased risk of the onset and
unfavorable course of CHD above and
beyond the influence of the traditional risk
factors. These include low socioeconomic
status, depressive symptoms and disorders,
other negative emotional traits (e.g., anxiety
and pessimism), acute and chronic stress,
and social isolation and conflict (Kop, 1999;
Krantz &amp; McCeney, 2002; Rozanski,
Blumenthal, &amp; Kaplan, 1999; Smith &amp; Ruiz,
2002). The identification of psychosocial risk
factors not only expands our understanding
of influences on this prevalent and costly
disease but also suggests additional avenues
for prevention and management.


The personality trait of hostiliry is one of
the most widely studied and well-documented
of the psychosocial risk factors (Miller,

[p. <i>20</i>]

Although typically conceptualized as simply
a characteristic of the person, hostility
and related traits are consistently related to
important interpersonal experiences. For
example, hostile people report low levels
of social support and high levels of conflict
compared to more agreeable people (Smith,
1992). Furthermore, these features of the
social context of hostility may be essential
elements of the mechanisms linking these
personality traits to CHD. As a result, interpersonal
processes are likely to be important
considerations in understanding the health
consequences of hostility and designing interventions
to reduce them (Smith et al., 2004).


In this chapter, we review evidence that at
least some of the effects of hostility on CHD
and general health involve close relationships,
specifically marriage. Hostility is associated
with increased exposure to conflict
and reduced levels of support in marriage,
and both of these interpersonal experiences
are associated with increased risk of CHD
and premature mortality (Smith &amp; Ruiz,
2002). In addition, hostile people display
increased physiological reactivity during
stressful marital interactions, and these
responses have been implicated in the initiation
and progression of CHD (Smith &amp; Ruiz,
2002). Therefore, a comprehensive understanding
of the mechanisms linking hostility
and health must include an examination of
the context of marriage and other close relationships.
Furthermore, if anger and hostility
are included in interventions intended to
reduce risk of initial or recurrent cardiovascular
events, then the context of relationships
may prove to be a useful addition to the
usual individual focus of such treatments.

<b>Pathophysiology of Coronary Heart Disease and the Role of Stress</b>

Understanding the effect of psychosocial risk
factors on CHD requires an understanding of
the nature of the disease and the basic psychophysiological
processes through which
personality, emotions, and the social environment
may contribute to disease development.
In the following sections, we describe
the nature and development of CHD and the
role of psychological stress in the underlying
pathophysiological processes.


<b><i>Coronary Artery Disease
and Manifestations of CHD</i></b>


The clinical manifestations of CHD
include angina pectoris, myocardial infarction,
and sudden coronary death. All three of
these clinical end points result from coronary
artery disease (CAD) or atherosclerosis in
the arteries that supply blood to the heart.
Beginning as early as childhood and becoming
more common and extensive with age,
lipids and related cells (e.g., macrophages

[p. <i>21</i>]

At later stages of CAD development,
these expanding lesions develop fibrous tissues
and calcification and are extensive enough to
encroach into the lumen or opening within the
artery through which blood flows. Sufficiently
advanced CAD of this type can cause myocardial
ischemia (i.e., insufficient oxygen supply
to the heart muscle) when the reduced supply
capacity caused by narrowing of these arteries
cannot match the heart's demand for oxygen
during times of physical exertion or emotional
stress. This ischemia is often "silent" or without
symptoms but also often causes stable
angina, which is chest pain of cardiac origin
that regularly occurs during physical exertion
or emotional arousal.


Inflammatory and hemodynamic processes
can also contribute to the progression
of some CAD lesions to an unstable form
and precipitate the rupture of such unstable
plaques. Ruptured plaques contribute to the
rapid formation of blood clots (i.e., thrombi),
which in turn can cause sudden and severe
blockage of the coronary blood supply. The
resulting ischemia can cause unstable angina
(i.e., rapidly worsening cardiac chest pain),
myocardial infarction (i.e., death of heart
muscle due to prolonged, severe ischemia), or
sudden death. Sudden cardiac death is typically
caused by a severe disturbance in the
rhythm of the heart, ventricular fibrillation,
that is promoted by ischemia and causes a
rapid cessation of systemic circulation.


<b><i>The Role of Psychological Stress</i></b>


Psychological stress has a variety of immediate
physiological effects that are implicated
in the initiation and progression of CAD
as well as in the emergence of the clinical
manifestations of CHD among people with
advanced CAD (Kop, 1999; Smith &amp; Ruiz,
2002). Cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) is
perhaps the most extensively studied of these
mechanisms. More frequent, pronounced,
and prolonged increases in blood pressure,
heart rate, and other cardiovascular
responses (e.g., increases in sympathetic excitation
of the heart and decreased parasympathetic
activity) have been identified as
contributing to the initial development and
progression of CAD and atherosclerosis at
other sites, and several studies support this
view (Kop, 1999; Rozanski et al., 1999;
Smith &amp; Ruiz, 2002). Other physiological
responses to stress that may promote CAD
include increases in circulating catecholamines,
cortisol, and plasma lipids; activation
of blood platelets; and inflammatory
responses (Kop, 1999, 2003).


Among people with established CAD,
psychological stress can induce myocardial
ischemia both in the laboratory, as assessed
by a variety of techniques, and during daily
activities, as assessed through ambulatory
electrocardiograph (ECG) recording (Krantz
&amp; McCeney, 2002). Transient stress-induced
ischemia may result when increases in the
rate and force of myocardial contractions
during psychological threats or challenges
create increased oxygen demand in this tissue.
This stress-induced increase in the heart's
demand for oxygen may exceed the available
supply because blood flow to the heart
muscle is limited by occlusive lesions in the
coronary arteries. Transient reductions in

<b>Association of Hostility with Cardiovascular and General Health</b>

In evaluating the contribution of hostility to
the development of CHD, three issues are
central. First, the nature and adequacy of the
measures of these individual differences in
emotion, cognition, and social behavior must
be considered. Second, the statistical association
between these measures and CHD must
be evaluated. Finally, the nature of the mechanisms
potentially accounting for this association
must be described and tested. Hence,
the evidence regarding the health consequences
of hostility consists of research on
these three issues.


<b><i>Assessment</i></b>


A variety of measures have been used to
assess individual differences in anger, hostility,
and aggressiveness in studies of CHD
and general health. To ensure that studies in
this area are indeed evaluating the health
consequences of these related traits, these
measures must be reliable and valid (Smith,
1992; Smith et al., 2004). The most commonly
used assessments are ratings of hostile
behavior during the Type A structured interview
(Rosenmann, 1978), the Cook and
Medley (1954) hostility (Ho) scale derived
from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory, and other self-report scales such
as the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire
(AQ) (Buss &amp; Perry, 1992). Behavioral ratings
of hostility can be made reliably and
are generally stable over time (Barefoot &amp;
Lipkus, 1994). Similarly, with some exceptions
(Smith &amp; Gallo, 2001; Smith et al.,
2004), these self-report measures are internally
consistent and stable over time. In most
cases, evaluations of construct validity have
indicated that these assessments show
expected associations with measures of conceptually
related constructs and smaller associations
with measures of conceptually
dissimilar traits (i.e., convergent and divergent
or discriminant validity, respectively).


These assessments are modestly intercorrelated,
however, most likely because they
use different methods (e.g., behavioral ratings
vs. self-report) and tap different facets
or aspects of the interrelated but distinct
cognitive, affective, and behavioral components
of this trait domain (Barefoot &amp;
Lipkus, 1994). Individuals may characteristically
display hostility during social interactions,
such as structured interviews, but
be unwilling or unable to accurately describe
this social style on self-report instruments,
especially given the negative connotation
of these behaviors and the susceptibility of
self-report instruments to social desirability
artifacts. Furthermore, even among self-report
instruments, the content varies in
terms of the relative emphasis on affective,
cognitive, or behavioral traits, and these
characteristics differ in important ways
(Costa, McCrae, &amp; Dembroski, 1989; Gallo
&amp; Smith, 1998). Hence, the association of

<b><i>Associations With
CHD and Longevity</i></b>


Although there are some inconsistencies
among studies testing the prospective relationship
between hostility and subsequent CHD
and premature death, this literature generally
indicates a robust effect. In a quantitative
review of studies published before 1996,
hostility was associated with increased risk of
CHD and premature mortality (Miller et al.,
1996), although this effect was stronger in
studies that used behavioral ratings to assess
this trait than in those that used self-reports of
hostility. Since that time, several studies have
confirmed this association. Among initially
healthy people, high scores on various self-reports
and behavioral ratings of hostility
have been associated with increased risk of
CHD, stroke, and early mortality (Chang,
Ford, Meoni, Wang, &amp; Klag, 2002; Everson
et al., 1997, 1999; Kawachi, Sparrow, Spiro,
Vokonas, &amp; Weiss, 1996; Matthews, Gump,
Harris, Haney, &amp; Barefoot, 2004; Williams
et al., 2000; Williams, Nieto, Sanford, Couper,
&amp; Tyroler, 2002), although some negative
findings have been reported (Eng, Fitzmaurice,
Kubzansky, Rimm, &amp; Kawachi, 2003; Sykes
et al., 2002).


In recent studies of people with established
CHD, various measures of hostility
have been associated with recurrent coronary
events and progression of CAD
(Angerer et al., 2000; Chaput et al., 2002;
Goodman, Quigley, Moran, Meilman, &amp;
Sherman, 1996; Mendes De Leon, Kop, de
Swart, Bar, &amp; Appels, 1996), although some
studies have reported negative findings in
this population (Kaufman et al., 1999;
Welin, Lappas, &amp; Wilhelmsen, 2000).
Overall, the association between hostility
and the initial occurrence of CHD and
longevity among initially healthy people
appears to be robust, whereas the association
with the course of established CHD
is somewhat more variable. This may be due
to a selection artifact; given the consistent
association of hostility with initial disease
development and CHD death, hostile people
who survive the initial occurrence of CHD
may be more resilient than hostile people
who did not. This would make it more difficult
to detect the effects of hostility on health
in clinical samples with established CHD
(Williams, 2000).


The statistical association between hostility
and CHD incidence among initially
healthy people may reflect the effects of this
personality trait at any number of time points
in the decades-long development of this disease.
That is, hostility may affect the initiation
or rate of progression of asymptomatic CAD,
the progression of stable CAD to unstable
and imminently dangerous forms, or the
occurrence of myocardial ischemia among
people with advanced disease. Studies suggest
that anger, hostility, and aggressiveness may
influence several of these phases of the disease
process. For example, in healthy individuals,
these traits are associated with ultrasound
measures of endothelial dysfunction, an
early indication of atherosclerosis (Harris,
Matthews, Sutton-Tyrrell, &amp; Kuller, 2003).
In other ultrasound assessments of healthy
people, hostility has been associated with
more extensive and more rapidly progressing
carotid artery disease (Julkunen, Salonen,
Kaplan, Chesney, &amp; Salonen, 1994;
Matthews, Owens, Kuller, Sutton-Tyrrell, &amp;
Jansen-McWilliams, 1998). Carotid artery
disease contributes to stroke, but atherosclerosis
in these arteries is often accompanied
by CAD. Recent developments in computed
tomography scan technology have provided
similar noninvasive tests of CAD through the
imaging of calcium deposits that occur at
lesion sites. In one study using this approach,

[p. <i>24</i>]

Several methodologies have been used to
evaluate the role of hostility in later stages of
CHD. For example, among CHD patients,
hostility is associated with greater myocardial
ischemia during laboratory Stressors
(Burg, Jain, Soufer, Kerns, &amp; Zaret, 1993;
Helmers et al., 1993; Rosenberg et al.,
2001). Similarly, among CHD patients,
experimentally induced anger can produce
myocardial ischemia (Ironson et al., 1992),
and episodes of anger are associated with
greater ischemia during daily activities, as
measured by Holter monitoring of ambulatory
ECG (Gabbay et al., 1996). Among
patients hospitalized for acute myocardial
infarction, interviews about activities and
experiences preceding the emergence of
symptoms of the unfolding coronary event
indicate that like smoking and heavy physical
exertion, anger is significantly more common
immediately before the onset of the event
than during similar time periods that were
not followed by acute illness (Mittleman
et al., 1995; Möller et al., 1999). Hence,
across these very different methods, evidence
suggests that anger and hostility can contribute
to the emergence of manifestations of
CHD among those with advanced disease.


<b><i>Mechanisms Linking
Hostility and Disease</i></b>


A variety of mechanisms may underlie
the associations among hostility, CHD, and
mortality described previously. For example,
it is possible that hostile people are prone to
smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and poor diet,
and that these traditional behavioral risk
factors may explain the association between
hostility and health. Some evidence of this
mechanism has emerged in epidemiological
research. Everson et al. (1997) found that the
association between hostility and subsequent
CHD was accounted for by the fact that hostile
people displayed higher levels of these
behavioral or lifestyle risk factors. In most
studies, however, the association between
hostility and subsequent health remains significant
even when behavioral risk factors
are controlled. As a result, two additional
pathways have received considerable attention
in research: exposure to stressors and
physiological reactivity to stressors.


<i>Hostility and Exposure to Stressors</i>


Individual differences in hostility are
consistently related to increased exposure
to a variety of stressors and to lower levels of
stress, buffering social support. For example,
compared to people who score low on various
measures of anger and hostility, hostile
people report higher levels of major life stressors,
minor daily stressors or hassles, job
stress, and other chronic stressors (Gallo &amp;
Smith, 1999; Smith, Pope, Sanders, Allred, &amp;
O'Keefe, 1988). Furthermore, hostility is
also associated with reports of reduced levels
of social support and greater levels of interpersonal
conflict (Hart, 1999; McCann,
Russo, &amp; Benjamin, 1997; O'Neil &amp; Emery,
2002). In studies sampling daily experiences
directly, hostility is associated with more frequent
and intense negative social interactions
and with less frequent and less intense positive
interactions (Brondolo et al., 2003).
Given their role as risk factors for CHD
(Smith &amp; Ruiz, 2002), high levels of stress
and low levels of social support constitute
psychosocial vulnerability to cardiovascular
and other illnesses, and these risk factors
may account for the association between
hostility and health (Smith, 1992).

[p. <i>25</i>]

The consistent association of hostility
with low support and high stress likely
reflects the impact of the hostile person's
characteristic style of thought and behavior
on the social context. That is, by expecting
mistreatment, attributing hostile intent to
the actions of others, and behaving in a cold
and antagonistic manner, hostile people
may create or exacerbate conflict and
undermine potential sources of social support.
This is the premise of the transactional
model of the effects of hostility on health
(Smith, 1992). In this view, hostile people
are exposed to greater stress and experience
less support in large part because of the
effects of their interpersonal style on those
around them. The transactional model is an
extension of the psychosocial vulnerability
model in that it provides a dynamic account
of the hostile person's increased exposure to
stressors and other unhealthy aspects of the
social environment.


<i>Hostility and Physiological
Reactivity to Stressors</i>


Another account of the mechanisms linking
hostility and health emphasizes physiological
responses to stressors rather than
exposure to such events. In this basic model
(Williams, Barefoot, &amp; Shekelle, 1985), hostile
people are hypothesized to respond to a
given social stressor (e.g., disagreement and
conflict) with more pronounced increases
in blood pressure, heart rate, and circulating
levels of stress hormones (e.g., catecholamines
and cortisol) than do nonhostile
people encountering similar circumstances.
As described previously, this heightened psychophysiological
reactivity may initiate and
hasten the development of CAD and promote
the emergence of later manifestations
of CHD among people with advanced CAD
(Kop, 1999; Smith &amp; Ruiz, 2002; Treiber
et al., 2003).


A large body of research supports the
hypothesis that hostile people respond to
social stressors with increased physiological
reactivity (Smith &amp; Gallo, 2001; Smith et al.,
2004). For example, compared to people with
low hostility, those high on behaviorally rated
or self-reported anger, hostility, and aggressiveness
have been found to display larger
increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and
various stress hormones in response to provocation
(Miller et al., 1998; Smith, Crawford,
&amp; Green, 2001; Suarez, Kuhn, Schanberg,
Williams, &amp; Zimmermann, 1998); discussion
of past anger-inducing events (Fredrickson
et al., 2000); current events discussions or
debates (Davis, Matthews, &amp; McGrath,
2000; Gallo, Smith, &amp; Kircher, 2000; Smith
&amp; Allred, 1989); and the self-disclosure of
personal information (Christensen &amp; Smith,
1993). Studies of cardiovascular and endocrine
responses during typical daily activities
suggest that the heightened reactivity of hostile
people also occurs in "real life" situations
(Benotsch, Christensen, &amp; McKelvey, 1997;
Brondolo et al., 2003; Polk, Kamarck, &amp;
Shiffman, 2002; Pope &amp; Smith, 1990). In
addition to these physiological correlates,
hostility is associated with higher levels of
blood lipids and larger stress-induced increases
in these atherogenic substances (Finney,
Stoney, &amp; Engebretson, 2002; Suarez, Bates,
&amp; Harralson, 1998). Other psychobiologic
mechanisms potentially contributing to the
health effects of hostility include activation of
blood platelets (Markovitz, 1998), higher concentrations
of plasma homocystine (Stoney &amp;
Engebretson, 2000), and higher levels of circulating
proinflammatory cytokines (Suarez,
2003a, 2003b; Suarez, Lewis, &amp; Kuhn, 2002).

<b>Marriage as a Key Context for Mechanisms Linking Hostility and Health</b>

The studies reviewed previously clearly indicate
that hostile people may be at greater risk
of CHD because they are both exposed to
more stressful experiences and have more

[p. <i>26</i>]

<b><i>General Health Consequences
of Marital Difficulties</i></b>


Married individuals are generally at lower
risk of CHD and other causes of premature
mortality than are their unmarried counterparts,
presumably reflecting the beneficial
effects of the social support inherent in marriage.
Interestingly, this protective effect of
marriage is generally stronger for men than
women (Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Newton, 2001).
Studies suggest, however, that the quality of
marriage is also an important influence on
health. For example, in one study of men
with elevated risk factors for CHD, marital
disruption (i.e., separation and divorce) was
associated with increased CHD incidence
(Matthews &amp; Gump, 2002). In a study of
postmenopausal women, marital strain was
associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis
(Gallo et al., 2003). Finally, in studies
of patients with established heart disease,
marital strain was associated with poor prognosis
(Orth-Gomer et al., 2000).


The effects of marital strain and disruption
on CHD may involve the psychophysiological
pathways described previously. A
variety of studies have examined the effects
of stressful marital interactions on increases
in heart rate, blood pressure, and circulating
levels of catecholamines, cortisol, and other
stress hormones (Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Newton,
2001; Robles &amp; Kiecolt-Glaser, 2003). For
example, discussions of topics of marital
disagreement reliably evoke increases in heart
rate and blood pressure, and the magnitude
of these increases is a positive function of the
level of negative behavior (e.g., hostility and
criticism) displayed by couples during the discussion
(Ewart, Taylor, Kraemer, &amp; Agras,
1991). Similarly, negative behavior during
such discussions is associated with higher circulating
levels of catecholamines and other
stress hormones (e.g., cortisol, growth hormone,
and adrenocorticotropic hormone)
(Malarkey, Kiecolt-Glaser, Pearl, &amp; Glaser,
1994). Marital stress and negative behavior
during conflict discussions are also associated
with alterations in immune function (Robles
&amp; Kiecolt-Glaser, 2003), and atherosclerosis
and acute coronary events are influenced
by inflammation and other immune system
mechanisms (Ross, 1999). Hence, just as the
positive and supportive aspects of marriage
may reduce the risk of CHD and other illnesses
by dampening cardiovascular, neuroendocrine,
and immunological responses
to stress, marital disruption and strain may
influence CAD and CHD by increasing the
frequency and severity of these psychophysiological
responses.


<b><i>Hostility and Exposure
to Marital Stress</i></b>


Several studies have demonstrated that
hostility is associated with concurrent reports
of reduced marital satisfaction and support
from one's spouse and with higher levels of
marital conflict (Glazer, Smith, Nealey, &amp;
Hawkins, 2002a, 2002b; Smith et al., 1988).
For example, in a sample of 120 young married
couples, we found that husbands' and
wives' scores on the anger and hostility scales
of the Buss-Perry AQ were associated with
lower concurrent levels of overall marital sat
isfaction, as assessed by the Locke-Wallace
Marital Adjustment Test (MAT), and with
higher levels of reported conflict with the

[p. <i>27</i>]

Prospective studies have also provided evidence
of greater exposure to marital stress
among hostile people. For example, Miller,
Marksides, Chiriboga, and Ray (1995) found
that individual differences in irritability were
associated with marital separation, divorce,
dissolution of a nonmarital relationship, and
unmarried status during an 11-year followup
period. In a sample of newlywed couples,
Newton and Kiecolt-Glaser (1995) found
that among husbands, higher scores on the
Ho scale were associated with decreases in
their own and their wives' reports of marital
quality during a 3-year follow-up period. In
an 18-month follow-up of our sample of
young married couples, higher initial levels
of wives' trait anger and hostility were associated
with decreases in their own and their
husbands' MAT scores. When these two
related personality characteristics were analyzed
together, trait anger was an independent
predictor of decreases in marital
satisfaction over time, but hostility was not.
That is, the effects of hostility on decreases in
MAT scores were due to its overlap with trait
anger. Interestingly, these effects of wives'
trait anger on declining marital satisfaction
appeared to be mediated by husbands'
reports of marital conflict. That is, the association
between wives' trait anger and reductions
in marital satisfaction over time was
accounted for by husbands' initial descriptions
of wives high in trait anger as displaying
high levels of hostile and critical behavior
during marital interaction.


Studies of actual marital interactions provide
converging evidence of higher exposure
to marital conflict among hostile people. In
one of our early studies of this type, we classified
husbands and wives as high versus low
hostile on the basis of their Ho scale scores
(Smith, Sanders, &amp; Alexander, 1990). From
a list of common topics of marital disagreement
(e.g., finances, in-laws, and children),
couples identified two low conflict topics
and one high conflict topic. Couples first discussed
a low conflict topic, followed by the
high conflict topic and then the second low
conflict topic. The discussions were videotaped
and later coded for the levels of hostility
displayed during the interaction. Couples
also rated their anger before and during the
conversations, the extent to which they
blamed their spouse for their disagreements
on the high conflict topic, and the extent to
which they viewed the spouse's behavior during
such discussions as intentionally causing
disagreements. Couples consisting of one or
more high hostile members displayed large
increases in the proportion of discussion
comments rated as hostile as they turned
from the initial low conflict topic to the high
conflict topic. During the initial low conflict
discussion, all couples made approximately
one hostile statement for every 10 comments,
and couples consisting of two low trait hostile
people maintained this low level of negativity
during the remainder of the discussions. In
contrast, couples with one or more hostile
members increased the rate of negativity to
three hostile comments for every 10 statements,
and this increased level of negativity
did not dissipate when they turned to the
second low conflict topic.


The association between trait hostility
and hostile behavior during the marital interaction
task was significant for both men and
women, although it was stronger for men.
Similarly, the association between trait hostility
and the magnitude of increases in state
anger during the high conflict discussion task
was stronger for men than women, as was the
tendency for hostile spouses to blame and
attribute hostile intent to their partner for
their difficulties regarding the high conflict
topic. Overall, individual differences in hostility
were associated with behavioral displays

[p. <i>28</i>]

<i><b>Hostility and Physiological
Reactivity During Marital
Interaction</b></i>


In several studies, high levels of trait hostility
have been associated with larger
increases in heart rate and blood pressure
during potentially stressful marital interactions.
In our first study of this type (Smith &amp;
Brown, 1991), we asked couples to discuss a
hypothetical problem in a local school district
(i.e., which personnel to retain during a budget
cutback). Half of the couples simply discussed
the issue, whereas the other half did so
with an incentive to influence the opinions of
their spouses. Among husbands, high scores
on the Ho scale were associated with greater
CVR when they were attempting to influence
their wives but not when they were simply
discussing the issue. Wives of high hostile
husbands also displayed greater CVR. In contrast,
wives' levels of trait hostility were unrelated
to their own or their husbands' levels of
CVR. In a replication of this study (Smith &amp;
Gallo, 1999), we asked couples to discuss
current events topics. Half of the couples simply
discussed the issues, and half did so with
the understanding that their remarks would
be evaluated for knowledge and effectiveness.
Among husbands, total scores on the BussPerry
AQ were associated with greater CVR
during the high, but not low, evaluative threat
discussions. Husbands' AQ scores were also
positively correlated with the magnitude of
their wives' cardiovascular responses during
the task.


In further analyses, among the four AQ
subscales (hostility, anger, verbal aggressiveness,
and physical aggressiveness), hostility
was the best predictor of husbands' CVR. As
in the prior study, wives' AQ total scores
were unrelated to their own or their husbands'
cardiovascular responses during the
discussion task. Hence, at least for men, hostility
has been consistently associated with
heightened CVR during potentially stressful
marital interactions. Wives' ratings of their
husbands' behavior during the discussion task
indicated that in the high, but not low, threat
condition, hostile husbands were perceived as
more dominant and controlling than low hostile
husbands. This suggests that the greater
cardiovascular responses displayed by hostile
husbands in the high threat condition may
result from efforts to exert control or status in
the discussion. Prior research in our laboratory
indicates that effortful attempts to influence
or control others evoke increases in heart
rate and blood pressure (Smith, Ruiz, &amp;
Uchino, 2000).


The most recent study of hostility, marital
interaction, and cardiovascular response in
our laboratory was an effort to address some
of the potential limitations of our prior work
(Smith, Nealey-Moore, Uchino, &amp; Hawkins,
2003). For example, the hypothetical problems
and current events that served as the
focus of the discussion tasks in prior studies
do not resemble closely the topics couples
typically identify as sources of conflict,
thereby posing a threat to the external or
"ecological" validity of our findings. Furthermore,
trait hostility predicted CVR during

[p. <i>29</i>]

Toward this end, we randomly assigned
80 married couples to one of two discussion
tasks. In the low conflict condition, participants
took turns describing what they knew
of their spouse's typical daily schedule. In the
high conflict condition, we provided both
spouses with a list of negative trait descriptors
(e.g., lazy and selfish) and asked them to
select three that described their partner.
During the task, participants took turns discussing
the negative characteristics that they
had selected as descriptive of their spouse.
Before the discussion task, participants completed
measures of state anger, and after the
task they completed a second state anger
measure and rated their spouse's behavior
during the task on the dimensions of warmth
versus hostility and dominance versus submissiveness.
For husbands, those high in trait
hostility and participating in the high conflict
discussion displayed the largest increases in
blood pressure and heart rate. For example,
high hostile husbands in the high conflict
condition displayed larger increases in systolic
blood pressure than did low hostile
husbands in this condition and high hostile
husbands in the low conflict task. Trait anger
did not predict these responses for husbands.
The high hostile husbands in the high conflict
condition were rated by their spouses as
unfriendly relative to the other groups of
husbands but not more controlling. Also,
these husbands did not report larger
increases in state anger than did the other
groups of husbands.


For wives, those high in trait anger participating
in the high conflict discussion displayed
the largest increases in blood pressure
and heart rate. Specifically, high trait anger
wives displayed larger increases in systolic
and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart
rate than did high trait anger wives in the low
conflict condition and low trait anger wives
in either discussion condition. Among wives,
trait hostility did not predict these cardiovascular
responses. High trait anger wives in the
high conflict condition reported much larger
increases in state anger than did the other
three groups of wives, and they were also
rated by their husbands as displaying much
more dominance during the interaction.


Hence, for both husbands and wives the
basic personality trait by situation interactive
effect that is the basis of the psychophysiological
reactivity model emerged, but the specific
trait involved in this pattern differed for
men and women. Cognitive aspects of this
domain captured by the AQ hostility subscale
(e.g., cynicism, mistrust, and attributions
of hostile intent) were important for men,
whereas affective aspects assessed by the AQ
trait anger subscale were important for
women. When combined with the results
of our other studies, it is clear that stressful
marital interactions can evoke heightened cardiovascular
reactivity from hostile men and
women in a pattern consistent with the psychophysiological
reactivity model, although
the specific individual differences related to
reactivity may differ for men and women.
Furthermore, aspects of stressful marital context
that evoke this heightened reactivity from
characteristically hostile and angry spouses
involve not only conflict and anger inducing
discord but also interactions in which challenges
to dominance and courrol are salient.

[p. <i>30</i>]
<b>A Model of Hostility, Marital Interaction, and Physiological Reactivity</b>

From the previous sections, it is clear that
characteristically hostile and angry people
are exposed to greater stress in marriage,
experience less support in this otherwise beneficial
relationship, and respond to potentially
stressful marital interactions with
heightened physiological reactivity. Figure 2.1
presents a general model of the mechanisms
that link these traits with psychosocial vulnerability
and psychophysiological reactivity
in the marital context. Although the model
emphasizes the personality trait of hostility,
it is also relevant to other personality traits or
individual differences that have been found
to (a) predict the development and course of
CHD and (b) be related to exposure to
aspects of marital functioning. For example,
both depression--as indexed by clinical disorders
or subclinical variation in depressive
symptoms--and the trait of optimism versus
pessimism are related to CHD in this way
(Smith &amp; Ruiz, 2002) and have been found
to predict exposure to levels of marital conflict
and support (Glazer et al., 2002a, 2002b;
Whisman, 2001).


The model is based on our previously
described application of the concepts of interpersonal
psychology (Keisler, 1996) to the
study of psychosocial risk factors and the
mechanisms linking them with disease (Gallo
&amp; Smith, 1999; Smith &amp; Gallo, 1999; Smith,
Gallo, &amp; Ruiz, 2003; Smith et al., 2004). The
interpersonal tradition in personality and
clinical psychology (for a review, see Pincus
&amp; Ansell, 2003) is based on the assumption
that personality comprises recurring patterns
of interpersonal situations and interactions.
The social behavior characterizing these patterns
varies along two basic dimensions:
dominance versus submissiveness (i.e., control)
and friendliness versus hostility (i.e.,
<br />

[p. <i>31</i>]

Figure 2.1 depicts these basic concepts in
the context of mechanisms linking personality
traits such as hostility to exposure to marital
stress and heightened physiological reactivity
to such stressful interactions. For example,
trait anger and hostility are associated with
negative views not only of others and relationships
but also of the hostile person himor
herself. Such people are likely to expect
mistreatment from others, including the
spouse; appraise ambiguous actions by the
spouse as hostile, controlling, threatening, or
some other form of mistreatment; attribute
negative intent to such actions; and experience
an increase in irritation or state anger.
These aspects of the hostile person's covert
experience are likely to lead to low levels of
expressed warmth and high levels of hostility,
control, and defensiveness in their overt
actions toward the spouse. Such actions, in
turn, restrict the spouse's covert experience,
making some interpretations and affects
much more common than others. As a result,
the spouse is likely to display unfriendly overt
behavior in response to the initial actor. In
this way, the hostile covert experiences and
overt behavior of the initial actor are confirmed
and complemented in a manner that
makes the continuation of prior personality
tendencies and relationship qualities likely.
That is, hostile people continually re-create
experiences in close relationships that promote
the continuation of the hostile tendencies
and the poor quality of their marriages
(for a review of transactional elements of
anger, hostility, and aggressiveness, see Smith
et al., 2004). It is important to note that these
processes influence not only high levels of
negative experiences in close relationships
(e.g., conflict, criticism, struggles for control,
and mistrusting vigilance for impending mistreatment)
but also low levels of positive
experiences (e.g., support). Furthermore, if
uninterrupted, a recurring pattern of such
cycles may place the couple at risk of marital
disruption (i.e., separation and divorce).


Most close relationships are characterized
by at least some negative interactions. The
psychophysiological reactivity model of the
health effects of hostility posits that hostility
and trait anger are associated with larger
perturbations in cardiovascular, neuroendocrine,
and immunological parameters at
such times. Hostile people will interpret such
events (e.g., attribute hostile intent to the

[p. <i>32</i>]

The specific interactions involving
warmth versus hostility and autonomy granting
versus control, described previously and
depicted in Figure 2.1, may be made more or
less frequent and pronounced by various
aspects of the couple's context. Their relationship
history, developmental stage (e.g.,
level of parenting demands and caregiving
for their own parents), and other sources of
chronic stress (e.g., crowded and unsafe
neighborhoods and high job stress) may
make positive or negative marital transactional
patterns more likely.

<b>Implications of the Marital Approach to Hostility and Health</b>

The model described previously suggests
several lines of additional needed research.
The specific cognitive, affective, and behavioral
processes involved in maladaptive marital
patterns associated with these traits should
be documented further. In describing and
explicating these patterns, it will be important
to consider specific aspects of trait anger, hostility,
and aggressiveness. For example, verbal
aggressiveness is an interpersonally unfriendly
and dominant style (Gallo &amp; Smith, 1998)
and may therefore be associated with marital
patterns involving conflicts regarding control.
In contrast, hostility reflects a more submissive
form of unfriendliness and therefore may
be involved in marital patterns in which vigilance
for potential mistreatment, withdrawal,
and resentful submission are more common.
In general, the varieties of hostile and angry
personality characteristics linked to CHD are
likely to be involved in similarly varied maladaptive
patterns of marital interaction.


Our findings regarding cardiovascular
responses to aspects of marital interaction
should be replicated and extended, but such
research should also examine the other
physiological responses to stress that are
implicated in the development of CHD,
especially the inflammatory processes that
are emerging as central to the development
and progression of this disease. As noted
previously, the model is also relevant to
other CHD risk factors that are also related
to marital functioning. Particularly relevant
in this regard is depression because it is a
robust predictor of the development and
course of CHD and seems to be both a
cause and a consequence of disturbed marital
functioning. Protective psychosocial
characteristics such as optimism may also
be examined in this manner. Finally, for
hostility, depression, and other individual
differences linked to both CHD and marital
functioning, more complete tests of the
general perspective are needed in which the
combined effects of the individual difference
and social context are examined as predictors
of CHD incidence and course.


Additional supportive findings from such
research would naturally raise questions
about applications to the management or
prevention of CHD. Psychosocial interventions
such as stress management have beneficial
effects on emotional, social, and even
physical outcomes among CHD patients
(Dusseldorp, van Elderen, Maes, Meulman,
&amp; Kraaij, 1999; Linden, Stossel. &amp; Maurice,
1996), although there have been notable
negative results of such interventions for
CHD. Several treatments for trait anger and
related characteristics tave been found
