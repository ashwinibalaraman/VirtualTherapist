Daniel Harrison had come back to town to see how
I was doing, and this day, the third day of his visit, early in the
morning, I lay in bed, only half-awake, and I thought in a
reverie....


<i>Today, you will start fighting again, hard, and with luck today
will be a fresh start and it will be climaxed by having your boss
to dinner. Dan will come into your home. He will see what
charming, sensible, nice young people Marilyn and you, especially
you, really are. The odds are truly all with you. Everybody
believes in you; Dan, especially now that your campaign
results are in, believes in you—despite your flight from the convention.
And your assistant, Leigh, believes in you, too. And
Marilyn, of course. She believes in you. Marilyn is your rock
and your rock is strong and your rock is firm in its love for you.
Your soft little rock of a wife, Marilyn, is your strength</i>....


<i>Dan will come into your home and Marilyn will have prepared
a casually elaborate dinner. This simple, hearty but
exquisitely prepared fare she will present to Dan as he sits in
relaxed comfort before her table. Carelessly, with no strain,
you will tell Marilyn that the dinner is good. But also you will
find some fault, perhaps the coffee, perhaps the dessert. This
will show Dan that you are a man of taste, a man of opinion,
and a firm but gentle-handed head of your own household. Dan,
of course, will have been soothed by a martini before the dinner
and after dinner you will have a V.O. or two together</i>....


Perhaps Dan and I would even get drunk together. Together

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then would it be, as this wonderful evening drew to its blissful
close, doubly sweet after the horror of the last few weeks,
that I would feel all fear leave my heart in a misty wave, and my
heart would once more be filled with love, warmth, courage and
all things that should be in the heart of a man.


Daniel Harrison would see revealed the renewal of my
strength, and he would leave for New York City, knowing that in
his representative Robert E. Dahl he had a young man who
once again showed great promise. And he would find himself
thinking of me affectionately too, as a friend, as well as one of
those he commanded.


That was the promise of this day in my fantasy, in my morning
reverie. That a miracle would happen.


But another promise I made also as I grew more wide-awake.
If the miracle did not happen, then I would search myself at that
evening dinner for the courage to tell Dan finally that I was
quitting!


The clock said quarter of eight. Marilyn was due at work at
eight. As usual, she wouldn't get there quite on time. She lay
on her side, facing me, her mouth slightly open, her eyes closed.
At peace.


"Marilyn. Marilyn. Are you going to work today, honey?"


"What?"


"Come on, babe, seven-forty-five!"


"Oh, no."

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She pulled herself to a sitting position, her face curling out
of its sleep into dismay. I lay in bed a second as she struggled
upright, her stomach in profile as she stood by the bed. The
stomach was big. The unreal confidence of my wish-filled dream
faded as it came to me that the stomach of my wife had grown
with frightening rapidity these last few weeks. And now, at the
beginning of her seventh month of pregnancy, the swelling of
her stomach brought home to me with shock that soon, in a very
short time, she would give birth to a child. <i>If only he would
stop his growth for just a little while, until you catch your
breath</i>.


We dressed. I helped Marilyn, awkward and careful with
the weight and size of her baby, struggle into the Ford. I climbed
in and we started for work.


I let Marilyn out at her office. I walked into my own office a
short time later. The telephone rang. It was Marilyn.


"Hello, honey," I said.


"Bob, I think I'd better go back home. I'm not feeling well."


... <i>It's the cold. It's got her down! Will she be well enough
to fix that dinner for Dan tonight? Pray, pray that she will.
Curse and pray, finger the silver coins in your pocket, and cross
your index and middle fingers of your right hand as it clutches
the phone. It is the dinner that has you worried, the critical,
all-important dinner. Does Marilyn realize the importance of
the dinner?</i> I hoped so. Because I couldn't mention its urgency
to her now—I couldn't do that—but I did.


"What do you think, babe? How about that dinner? If you
don't feel like it, give it up."


<i>Let the choice be hers. Let the guilt fall on her shoulders, if
the dinner is not prepared! Leave it up to your pregnant wife.
Let her make the decision</i>.


A pause, then Marilyn said, "I guess I can get dinner O.K."


"Well, it's up to you, babe. I don't want you overdoing it,
but I don't know how you feel, either. So you decide."


Marilyn's voice came flat and tired. "Don't worry, honey.

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"O.K., if that's the way you want to do it. I'll be by for you
in a minute and take you home."


"No, don't bother. I'll get a cab. You've lots to do today,"
said Marilyn in that flat, tired, sweet voice. "Be good and don't
worry. Everything will be all right. We'll have a nice dinner."


Marilyn was gone. I stared at the mess of work before me.
<i>Why didn't Dan call? ... Ring, phone, ring. If Dan would only
pull you away from this hideous detail to more important matters</i> ...


Silence in the office ... the clock ticking away ... 12:05 P.M.
... I was still staring blindly at the typewriter when Dan walked
into the office at 12:30.


Daniel Harrison. Ruddy complexion, crew-cut brown hair
beginning to gray. Six feet tall, his back a stiff, wide board. He
painfully struggled out from under his carefully tailored, heavy
topcoat.


"How are you feeling, Dan?"


"Terrible! How about you?"


(Me? How do you think I feel?) "I feel pretty good. Back
giving you hell again?"


"It sure is."


And so here was Dan standing in front of me and here was I
sitting at my desk. <i>Where do we go from here?</i> I fingered a
treasurer's report from one of the chapters.


Dan, with infinite perception and great kindness it seemed to
me at that moment, said, "Let's eat."


And then over coffee: "Dan, I want an honest opinion. You've
been with me for three days now. Do you think I'll make it
O.K.? Have I been doing all right?" <i>Let him make the decision</i>.


The question turned Dan's face into a mask. "Bob, this is
the third time you've brought it up. <i>You're</i> bringing it up again
now, Bob. Not me, but you. Remember that!


"And you brought up the resignation talk at the New York

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"But you brought it up for <i>the second time</i>, not me but you,
and in front of my wife at a time when the talk should have
been social, not business. And you raised the whole damn question
of resignation in the first place, the last time I was here.
Even before the New York meeting. And I took a chance on you,
felt sorry for you, talked to you man to man, and I thought I had
you straightened out that we want you and need you. But I guess
it just didn't click."


<i>Smoke the cigarette, drink the burning coffee, do anything but
dare to look into the hard, sad eyes of Daniel Harrison ... and
so the comic tragedy of the hired weakling failing despite the
will and strength of the kind boss is drawing to a close. But not
yet.... Still you must fight that it be done with some saving
of grace for your dying ego. You won't drive him to it. At
least not now in this way. Tonight ... tonight ... you'll fling
the final, irrevocable, "I quit" into his face</i>....


"Bob, remember I've tried to help you. Don't you ever forget
that," said the mysterious, insinuating voice of iron-faced Dan.


... <i>Get away from it now. Postpone this decision which soon
must be made</i>....


"Dan, Marilyn wants you to come out for dinner tonight."


Dan winced, "Bob, you two don't have to go to any trouble for
me."


"But, Dan, we're counting on you."


"But, Bob, I don't <i>want</i> you to go to any trouble. We can eat
together ... downtown."


... <i>Insist with all the strength of the fading will</i>....


"Dan, please come. Marilyn's at home now fixing some
things."

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He was trapped, "All right, Bob. I'll come out and thanks a
lot. Thank Marilyn for me, too. It's very nice and thoughtful
of the two of you."


In the evening early, at home, the table was set. The dinner
was going just fine, almost. Everybody was almost comfortable.
Dan exclaimed with proper enthusiasm at the tastiness of each
dish, and I said with what I hoped was proper husbandly authority,
"The dinner is fine, maybe not quite so good as usual,
and honey, there's something wrong with the coffee."


The courses were finished with polite gusto and with rapidity.
<i>Eat ... eat ... lest you have to take the lead in a conversation,
lad</i>....


The dinner was over. <i>Clear the dishes, Marilyn. Let's be on
with this travesty</i>.


I brushed past my wife's swollen stomach toward the refrigerator,
got out the ice cubes, poured the V.O. into the glasses.
Dan sat stiff and straight in his chair, waiting to be served.


"Thanks, Bob. And after we finish this, it might not be too
late to drop by Leigh's. She asked us to come over for a while
this evening."


<i>Thank you, Leigh, for delaying the inevitable</i>.


Silence on the way to Leigh's. Ten minutes ticked away as the
Ford carried the three of us along....


<i>Damn those chuckholes in the beat-up streets.... When will
you get the courage to tell him that you've had enough? That
you're sick of the job, sick of him, sick of Leigh, sick of all the
volunteers and all the staff, sick of your pregnant wife, and
most of all, sick of your own miserable self</i>....


"Dan, I hope these bumps aren't giving your back a bad
time."


<i>But how about a bad time for Marilyn as you hurl the Ford
wildly over deep pits in the crumbling road? How about your
unborn son—aren't you shaking him a bit too much? Brush the
unbidden thought away and brush the forbidden answer to such
hellish questions back far into the pit of your soul.... Don't</i>

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I skidded to a stop. We were at Leigh's house and we walked
the curving path into the friendly porch lights of Leigh's half
of the double.


What I had thought would be brief sanctuary wasn't. The
session that followed turned into a madness of forced gaiety by
all concerned.


Leigh met us, then went back upstairs for a moment more of
fixing up. It was still just Marilyn, Dan and me. Marilyn was
on the sofa, Dan in the easy chair across from her. I sat in a
low, uncomfortable chair near the stairs. The three of us were
tired of staring at one another. Our conversational resources,
particularly mine, were exhausted. Fresh human beings were
needed to stir the imagination and excite the talk.


<i>Marilyn is a coward, escaping that way with her knitting.
How she has the needles working; how they dart in and out of the
little blue sweater she is creating! Nice for her. She has something
to do, but how about you? The only release for you is to
smoke this damned cigarette and drink this tasteless whisky in
your hand. Well ... maybe there's good in the knitting after
all. You can talk about it</i>.


"Dan, see that sweater? Marilyn, let Dan see the neck."


Marilyn held the sweater in the air, turned the empty neck
toward Dan.


"Maybe I <i>have</i> gotten it too little," she said.


I said, "Maybe? Even if you have a midget of an infant, it's
too small. Why, you could hardly slip a pencil through that
neck."

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Marilyn was hurt. "I just want the baby to have a sweater
he can wear as soon as we get home from the hospital."


<i>She's a stubborn wife and now she's making you seem foolish
and maybe a little cruel before your boss. You cannot afford
to let her win the argument and besides, if you keep on needling
her, it'll keep the conversation going</i>.


"Honey—" laugh, laugh—"that sweater is a mess. It's worthless,
honey. Our child would strangle in it."


<i>Laugh, laugh, laugh, until you think your heart will crack in
two with the pain</i>.


Now Marilyn bridled a little with quiet dignity, "Bob, this is
my first sweater. Maybe I'll do better on the next one."


Silence. Leigh came downstairs now, all prettied up.


I said, "Leigh, I've taken the liberty of fixing you a drink."


Marilyn shifted a little behind the sweater and a smile came
to her face.


"Is he kicking, honey?" I asked.


"A little."


<i>Kick away, little Stevie-to-be! Punch your little fetus fist
through the belly wall of my little mate. Crack the egg shell,
eager chick. But, oh, what a fool you are to be so eager to enter
this strange world of brother fools!</i>


My whisky glass was empty again. When I came back from
the kitchen with the refill, Marilyn was gone.


"Where's Marilyn?" I said.


Leigh said archly, "She's up in the you-know-what."


"Oh."


<i>What's the matter, Marilyn? Bid you have to run and hide?
Wasn't the knitting sufficient protection against all of this
damned drinking and fake laughter?</i>


Dan stirred from lethargy and turned to question Leigh about
our fund-raising campaigns in several key cities. Leigh was on
her mettle in her replies. I could see Dan was impressed.


I interrupted her. "Wonder what's keeping Marilyn?"


She appeared as if in answer to a summons, looked at the

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"How you doing, honey?" I asked her.


"All right, I guess."


"Do you think we should go home?"


"Pretty soon now."


Dan looked at his watch. "Ten-forty-five ... Leigh, I'm sorry,
but I'm still tired from last night. Think I'd better get on back
to the hotel and get some sleep. Will you take me out to the
plane tomorrow? I have some things I want to go over with you."


<i>Well, good. It's all set. Finally you can go home and flee,
flee the whole damn world and all its people and all their damn
problems and all their damn meanness and weaknesses, and most
of all you can flee your own weak, hate-filled, mean self. Sleep
is only minutes away. Figure five minutes for the lingering
good-bys. Mustn't hurry away from hostess. She might think
you're leaving mad. Figure another fifteen minutes to drive Dan
downtown and the same amount home, and it will mean ... in
bed by eleven-forty. Tomorrow you can sleep until nine.
Marilyn can take the bus to work. You run down to the office
an hour later and tell Dan the good news of your resignation ...
in finality!</i>


"Good night, Bob. 'Night, Marilyn, take care of that cold.
Get some sleep now, Dan."


"Good night, Leigh, thanks for the hospitality. I'll see you in
the morning," Dan said. "Oh, if only I can get a good night's
rest! And ease this aching back."


"Good night, everybody."


There was waving of hands, cheery smiles fading away in the
night, and then into the Ford.


A few senseless, light comments by Dan and Marilyn as I
took the River Parkway toward the hotel. Then silence and the
car moved swiftly along the winding boulevard.

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Oh, Bob!" It was Dan in a scream of agony as the car's
wheels smashed down into another one of those chuckholes in
the pavement.


"I'm sorry, Dan. Hurt your back?"


"Yes!"


Marilyn was silent.


<i>How is she doing? You hope O.K. You hope she's feeling
O.K. over this bumpy road and that she's not too tired and that
she's not upset by your drinking. The drinking really didn't
have much effect anyway ... slow down now, fool. Do you want
to cripple your boss permanently? At last at the hotel entrance.
At last the final, grateful good-by.... How nice to see no more
of Dan for a while, even if it's only a few hours. The fear in
your chest, right above the diaphragm, is beginning to fade at
the sweet promise of sleep's escape</i>....


Marilyn and I were alone. The Ford moved slowly toward
the apartment, toward the cosy little double bed of peace at last.


I said to Marilyn, "Honey, I'm sorry I griped about the coffee.
I guess I was just showing off for Dan."


"It's, all right, honey. I just want you to be yourself again.
That's all I want, Bob." A pause, and then: "Honey, I started
to get an awful cramp in my stomach at Leigh's, and it seems
to be getting worse."


I helped her out of the car in front of our apartment building.


I held her arm as we slowly walked up the steps leading to the
first-floor landing. As I held her arm, I felt mean about some of
the things I'd done and hadn't done this night, and some of the
things my tortured mind had ground out, hate-filled into my fearful
soul.


We went up ten more steps. Marilyn placed her hand against
the wall as if it would give her strength. This step climbing was
certainly getting to be a job for her.


"Just a couple more steps, honey, and we're on the second
floor. Take it easy. There's no hurry."

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Her head was bowed, as if bent by a great weight.


Then Marilyn's hand pressed against the wall and she said in
a hollow whisper, "I have just got to get home!"


<i>God, what is she saying? Is she out of her mind? Has your
own fear and tension driven your pregnant wife insane?</i>


Again it came, the horrible soft, tired voice of a human soul
in anguish—"I've got to get home."


It was exactly the same thing I had cried into the phone to her
in the hotel room in New York City when I was in panic.


"Honey, what the <i>hell</i> is wrong?"


"I don't know."


"Let me carry you."


I slipped my arm around her waist and started to lift.


"I can make it by myself. If I can just get into the apartment."


And then she lifted one foot and dragged the other after it.
Her shoes slipped out at the heels and then back in again. On
the landing she clutched her stomach, pressed against it hard
with her free hand.


<i>Drag the little leaden feet along the landing. Move toward
the all-important goal, Marilyn. I love you, honey! Whatever
it is, don't let anything serious be wrong. Honey! You can't do
this to me! Marilyn, can't you hear my silent scream? Don't
frighten me, love, any more than I already am. Another load of
fear will send me down to the ground, a snarling, crawling
animal.... Marilyn, you are my rock. Honey, don't wash away
now like soapstone into the muddy yellow of my former prides
in self and friends and job</i>....


<i>Up, up, up to the haven of the apartment. It's only a few
steps above you, Marilyn, if only you will fight your white-faced
way up those steps. Then the two of us will be able to sit down
on the red sofa in our enchanted cottage, and together, very
calmly and sensibly, we'll talk over the problem, debate it pro
and con, figure out possible solutions and then act on them with
ease and deliberation like the two sensible people we really are</i>.

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Only a couple of steps now, but she stopped. She stopped and
she didn't move. Her head was down. I grabbed her at the waist
and started to lift.


"Honey, don't. You'll hurt the baby."


She pushed me away and, supporting little Stevie with her
hands pressed under her bulging belly, she took another step
upward.


<i>Now this creature next to you has become a stranger. You
feel sorrow for it in a detached sort of way. Poor sick thing.
What a rough time it is having as it fights its way toward its
mountain den. Well, now look. How strange. This fat female
mammal has dropped the crocheting bag it so lovingly carried
a bit ago. Is the bag back some place on the stairs? Well, now,
the poor suffering thing had something in that bag it cherished—
a knitted, blue, white-trimmed sweater made for someone named
Stevie. Maybe the creature would be happy to have the sweater
back. Boy Scout! Here's your chance. Good deed for the day.
Get the bright blue baby sweater for the lady! There isn't time.
Surprise! She's made it to the apartment door. Fumble in the
pocket. How embarrassing if you've left the key in the car. No,
here it is. See, Marilyn can be proud of you. In this crisis you
haven't lost the key!</i>


<i>Come on, lock. Open, door, before my wife dies in this hallway!
There! Good! Now we're home and all should be well
soon</i>.


"Marilyn, how are you doing?"


"Bob, you'd better call Dr. Frazier right away. I'm hemorrhaging
badly."


I picked up the phone book and wondered why the hell I
didn't keep his number handy. There it was. I tried to keep it
in my head, fix it in my mind as my trembling finger went
around the dial. A woman's voice answered, "Hello."


"Is Dr. Frazier there?"


"No, he isn't. I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do for you?"


"This is Bob Dahl. My wife is a patient of your husband's.

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Well, he's not here right now. I'll try to get hold of him.
What seems to be the trouble?"


<i>The trouble is, damn it, she may be bleeding to death and
poor Stevie, too</i>.


"Mrs. Frazier, you've got to get the doctor right away. She's
lost a lot of blood."


"Is she still bleeding much or has it slowed down?"


"Marilyn, how is the bleeding? ... Mrs. Frazier, she says
maybe it's not as bad as it was. Will you please hurry now to
find the doctor?"


"Well, Mr. Dahl, I'll do my best, I promise you, but he may
be hard to locate."


<i>Marilyn is silent. Why doesn't she speak from her refuge in
the bathroom? Is she dead? If she would only talk to you, to
prove that she doesn't hate you</i>.


<i>What now? So many possibilities. Most of all, you mustn't
get Marilyn overly excited. Shall we call the emergency squad?
But is this absolutely necessary and if not why alarm her by
the display of urgency? How about calling the hospital? Which
one? The one where she is to have the baby! Which one?
Glenview? Community? Mercy? Is it Faith, Hope or Charity?
St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, St. John? Why, of course, St.
John's! Well, if you call, maybe you'll have a busy line when
Frazier phones back trying to reach you. The whole strange,
weird business certainly is confusing. One thing for sure: You
don't want to make any mistakes, so let's consider each and
every one of the possibilities, quickly but thoroughly. But it's
hard to think with that damned silence bursting your eardrums</i>.


The phone rang.


"Hello, Mr. Dahl? This is Dr. Frazier."


"Hello, Doctor. Did your wife tell you about Marilyn?"


"Yes. We'd better get her to the hospital as fast as possible.


We may not run into any trouble, but if she is hemorrhaging,

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Doctor?"


"Yes?"


"What's the trouble with her?"


"I'm not sure.... I'm hanging up now to call an ambulance."


I turned from the phone and Marilyn, a pitiful little horror
of a white, bent ghost, was stumbling toward the bedroom.


<i>She walks; she talks; she smiles; she seems like a human being,
but really now she is a bloodless zombie. She lies on the
bed, poor, chalk-faced thing. She breathes, in and out. She
mutters. She holds your hand and squeezes it convulsively</i>.


<i>You've been so cruel to her, so mean and cruel. Why, there
are her plants. The ivy vine hanging on the wall. How she's
loved that ivy! How she's fought for its life! How she's told
you day by day of her struggle against death and disease in her
valiant, loving fight for her green-grown symbol of life. And
how deaf your ears have been! And how eagerly each night
you've flown from her love and faith into the funny papers to
howl at Al Capp's monsters</i>.


There was a polite, soft knock at the living-room door. I
rushed toward it. The ambulance men. A team, one tall and
fat, the other short and fat. Husky lads. Good, I thought. Maybe
they won't spill Marilyn when they cart her down that flight of
three-storied steps.


Slowly, carefully, they moved her down the stairs on a long,
white-sheeted pallet on wheels.
