"Is this client a veteran and, if so, are
there special issues that may interact with the presenting problem,
counseling techniques, and therapeutic goals?" That question is probably
infrequently considered by counselors working with male clients unless one
is a counselor in a Veterans Administration (VA) facility or a Veterans
Outreach Center. Often men who are veterans are referred to VA sources
since that is what the VA is "supposed to do." Unfortunately for many
clients, a VA facility is not convenient and/ or the veteran is not eligible for
services. Thus the man seeking counseling may be a veteran with certain
special issues originating from his service experiences that he may or may
not present. Likewise, he may be a veteran whose concerns are addressed in
other chapters in this book and are not specifically veteran related. This
chapter is designed to (a) help the counselor understand the service and
veteran experiences, (b) look at specific concerns of veterans, and (c) offer
some suggestions about counseling with veterans.


So who are veterans? In the vast majority of cases they are males who
have been drafted or who enlisted for a period of active duty in one of the
military armed services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast
Guard). Some may have served with national guard or reserve forces but
also served for a period on active duty in order to be considered a veteran.
According to data provided by the VA (1984), it is estimated there were
28,202,000 veterans alive in 1983. There have been four major conflicts/wars
(Korea and Vietnam were never officially declared wars by the
U.;S.; Congress) since the turn of the century. From World War I there are
about 297,000 veterans still alive whose average age in 1986 is thought to be
between 85 to 90 years old. For World War II there are about 10,978,000

<b>The Military Experience</b>


Every male who has served on active
military duty has had a unique experience. Veterans during different wars
had different experiences. It is probably unfair to generalize or describe a
typical experience, but it becomes necessary to make the attempt for
brevity's sake. The typical military experience begins in the late teens or
early twenties. Erik Erikson (1950, 1968) in his eight-stage model of
psychsocial human development, posed two important tasks for this life
period. Erikson's stages that correspond to the time of entry into the
military service are establishing one's own individual identity versus being
involved in role confusion (14-20 years) and establishing intimate relationships
versus being socially isolated (20-40 years). Most veterans had lived
within a family context with a set of instilled values, mores, and beliefs until
they made a break and were sworn into the armed forces. Culture shock
began immediately.


Upon entry onto active duty, the young person goes through a period of
basic training: generally an eight-week period of intense physical and
mental indoctrination and training that is designed to turn a young civilian
lad into a competent American fighting man whose job is to fight in wars.
For most recruits (the name given to a new soldier in training) basic
training is bewildering, scary, and physically demanding. There is much to
learn, with immediate negative reinforcement for the slightest mistake
delivered by a fierce-looking drill sergeant whose demeanor commands
fear and respect. The young recruit is being trained for combat and his
mission will be to kill the "enemy." This becomes the first major value
conflict that a young man must resolve. For 18 years he lived in a society in
which killing was wrong, and yet now killing is what he is supposed to do
(cognitive dissonance to the nth degree; Festinger, 1957). The military
helps to resolve this conflict by first depersonalizing the "enemy." The
enemy is never referred to as a person or anything that gives humanlike
qualities to the object of our violence. Nicknames are given to the enemy to

[p. <i>345</i>]

Although a counselor may become angry, upset, or empathize with how
awful that situation must be for the young male, one needs to remember
that there are reasons for all of those resolving mechanisms. Primarily the
training helps with the physical survival of the recruit and his fellow
recruits when they enter a combat situation. A moment's hesitation as one
stops to "think about" a situation may lead to a horrible wound or death. In
the survivalistic environment of war, reactions are often more important to
the individual soldier than are his cognitive abilities. The military trains
reactions that save friendly lives while destroying the enemy. Most people
want to live and so adopt the reactions. Almost of equal importance as the
physical survival is the psychological survival that the training provides. If
the military says to the recruit, "Your country wants you to go and kill
18-year-old boys, who just graduated from high school, who have a
mother, father and two sisters, and who pray to the same God as you do,"
the value conflict would be so intense that the recruit would not function
effectively in combat. A massive guilt complex would likely develop.
Psychological survival would be in grave jeopardy. Instead, the coping
mechanisms the military provides usually help young men to do what their
country wants them to do: to fight a war, to kill the enemy.


Besides killing, there are other value conflicts that arise for young men.
Many men had never lived outside their own community before entering
the military. Suddenly, they are thrown into a new community with other
young men from different communities and backgrounds. Values, beliefs,
and mores different from one's own may become the new norm. One's
individual identity, different from one's identity within the family, may
create the role confusion Erikson (1950, 1968) proposed. To use alcohol,
marijuana, or other street drugs may now become the "manly" thing to do.
To engage in sexual activity with prostitutes may be the accepted group
norm. To get into fights at local hangouts may be the merit badge required
to show manhood. Many of these same dilemmas are faced by young men
not in the military as well, but the group pressure of military "esprit de

[p. <i>346</i>]

The most significant part of the military experience is being involved in
combat. Combat strips away almost all vestiges of humanity. It is the
ultimate "game of survival." Life and death occur randomly with little
rhyme or reason. There may or may not be a geographical objective
/purposeon the large scale; for the individual soldier the objective
becomes kill or be killed. Most of the time nothing else matters. Men in
combat are regressed to more primitive levels of thinking and behavior.
The environment is no longer safe. Naturalistic dangers are often as deadly
as man-made dangers. The most basic need on Maslow's hierarchy (1943)
becomes threatened. Behavior becomes motivated to satisfy the physical
needs for survival. Horrors, pain, and suffering beyond human comprehension
occur routinely. After leading his famous Civil War "March to the
Sea," General William Tecumseh Sherman is supposed to have stated,
"War is hell." The destruction and devastation he witnessed in the
aftermath of his army's movement became overwhelming for him to
contemplate. For most people who believe in hell, combat surpasses their
concept of what hell is. Combat is hell on earth but far worse. Nothing man
does compares to it as a human activity. Think of the worst situation one
can. Combat is worse!


One could write an entire chapter—an entire book—on describing what
combat is like. That would only tell what combat, at that time, in that place,
in that war, was like. The next war would be the same, yet different. Suffice
it to say that war is, on the one hand, exhilarating for some men, giving
them a God-like feeling of the power of life and death over another; and on
the other hand, afeeling of the devastation and helplessness as the power of
life and death is in the hands of the enemy. The adrenaline rush caused by the
anxiety of combat can also become debilitating, making it difficult to cope
with the stresses of everyday life. More will be stated about combat in the
next section.


After a war, veterans either return to civilian life or continue with a
career in the military. Reintegration into civilian life often leads to feelings
of alienation and differentness. Friends and relatives who did not go to war
have continued their lives without interruption. Their existence may not
have been affected unless a son or brother or husband was wounded, taken
prisoner, or killed in the war. The returnee wants to get on with his life,
putting the war behind him. Unfortunately that may be easier said than
done. The family may not want to talk about what happened in the war
because they may have seen some of the horrors of war on the nightly news
and do not want to explore the possibility that their veteran had been
involved in such events. The veteran may quickly pick up on the unspoken
message that talking about the war is taboo. Feelings of not being accepted
or that by serving their country they had done something wrong may

[p. <i>347</i>]

Those veterans who remain in the military may experience many of the
same problems as veterans who get out. Military life away from combat
may be seen as "Mickey Mouse," which translated from military slang
means "unimportant, comical, and inane." Spit and polish, strict discipline,
and "fill the time" activities of a peacetime military do not compare with the
excitement and meaningful activity of combat. Again, discipline problems
may develop to include alcohol and/ or drug abuse. The serviceman may be
referred to counseling, may make an adequate adjustment, or be discharged
from the service. If he stays in the service until he retires, he may then face
adjustment problems in his move into the civilian world. The closed society
of the military has provided a safe comfortable environment in which he
has lived for at least 20 years. The customs and traditions within the
military community may be different from those in the civilian world. The
lack of common experiences, the military behavioral repertoire, and the
different view of the world may also lead to adjustment difficulties.
Retirement issues may also be encountered by veterans, as well as the
difficulties of starting a second career in the middle years or older age level.
A similar view of "counseling is for crazies" often prevents a retired veteran
from seeking the counseling that could help him become as successful in
civilian life as he had been in the military. The military experience generally
ends for most males back in the civilian world from which they entered the
military. That does not necessarily mean the same hometown in which they
were raised, but the civilian world. They are now veterans and may appear
as a client with any of the presenting unique problems because of their
experiences as veterans. The next two sections present information on those
unique problems.

[p. <i>348</i>]

<b>Post Traumatic</b>


<b>Stress Disorder</b>


The most common presenting
problem of male veterans seeking counseling and psychotherapy may not
be easily identified by the veteran or the counselor. A variety of symptoms
or behavioral patterns may be presented that may lead to different
conceptualizations or diagnoses. The veteran may be reluctant to tell every
detail to the counselor unless asked and asked in the right way. Without the
right questions, the core problem will not be identified and thus not
addressed in counseling or therapy sessions. The right questions focus on
military experiences, especially about combat or hazardous duty in which
the veteran may have participated or had been in a support role in which he
dealt with the carnage of war. Because of the reluctance to talk about the
war, it may require an extended evaluation session or several sessions
before the veteran (client) begins to develop the therapeutic trust in the
counselor. Many veterans are not only afraid that they will be considered
"crazy," they also fear that what they tell will either cause a feeling of
disbelief in the counselor or the counselor will think they are terrible people
for having done what they did in combat. Sarah Haley (1978) and Arthur
Egendorf (1978) present excellent chapters on the therapist-veteran
interaction during treatment sessions, especially when the horrors and
atrocities are revealed. Carl Rogers's (1951) concept of "positive regard"
may never be more greatly tested than when listening to a veteran talk
about killing eagerly, as if he had enjoyed it, or with total lack of feelings. It
is best if the counselor keeps in mind just how horrible the experience of
combat is. In combat man often regresses to a more primitive man whose
main concern is the survival of his physical and psychological self. The
biggest legacy of combat is the experience of trauma. Trauma to the
physical self and trauma to the psychological self. Combat trauma is often
painful to even think about, let alone talk about with a stranger. The
counselor needs to be aware of the veteran's issues about war as well as their
own issues about war.


For many veterans the experience of combat trauma overwhelms, them
and results in a variety of symptoms. At various times throughout military
medical history the cluster of symptoms has been called by different names
such as "shell shocked," "combat fatigue," "combat exhaustion," "traumatic
neurosis," "operational fatigue," and others. In 1980, a new disorder
called "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder" (PTSD) was added to the DSM-III.
The counselor is referred to DSM-III for a detailed description of the
symptoms of PTSD (American Psychiatric Association, 1980).


Besides the symptoms of DSM-III, others have suggested that additional
symptoms need to be included. Silver and Iacono (1984) reported
depression and anger as additional symptoms, especially in Vietnam

[p. <i>349</i>]

In closing this section, three symptoms that are frequently seen in
counseling are reviewed. The first is anomie, which can be described as a
loss of interest, a loss of a sense of purpose, or a loss of direction. After the
combat experience, nothing else compares to it. In the best and worst
senses, combat is probably the highest level of feeling alive. The best sense
is in terms of the development of the greatest love between human beings
undergoing the worst human experience. Every sense is heightened to the
highest degree, and the combatants become mutually dependent upon one
another for survival. The bond goes beyond family and marital love. It is a
love in which one will sacrifice one's own life without thinking in order to
save another. On the other hand, combat allows one to see the worst side of
humankind in terms of the killing and atrocities one human being does to
another. After reaching the acme and the nadir of human experience, many
veterans present themselves in a depressed state. They go through the
motions of living, yet appear almost zombielike, as if nothing seems to
matter to them. It is as if they are burned out on life. A similar response is
the veteran who is overly concerned, overly identified with another person.
Often it is with a child, and the veteran's life becomes enmeshed with the
child's life. The sole sense of purpose becomes the protection of the child.
The counselor's investigation may lead the counselor to events from the
traumatic experiences involving children, which helps explain the veteran's
behavior. Finally, another symptom is the veteran who is a bomb waiting
to explode. Rage reactions, super irritability, and continual anger become
the norm for some veterans' behaviors. It appears almost as if they are
addicted to this energized state, and some do seek the "thrill of combat" by
frequenting places in which fights are more likely to happen. Their negative
feelings are often blamed on others; yet this may only be a way to protect
the psychological self from self-condemnation for actions performed
during traumatic events. Often, acting-out behaviors are symbolic reenactments
of the traumatic events. As counselors, it is important to see beyond
our own emotional reactions when a client becomes enraged, and to
understand what has happened to trigger such behavior. It is not an easy
task but a necessary one when a client is in that much pain.


<b>Counseling with</b>


<b>PTSD Veterans</b>


There have been several excellent
books and articles published on doing therapy with war veterans, especially

[p. <i>350</i>]

The list of references could go on for pages. Counselors will, however,
pick and choose what method will work for them and apply it, just as they
do with any client. With the male veteran who has PTSD, certain issues
may be more prominent and so I will devote some time to each.


<b>THE "I WONT TALK</b>


<b>'CAUSE YOU AREN'T A</b>


<b>VETERAN" ISSUE</b>


Many veterans offer stiff resistance
to entering into a counseling relationship. It may be sex, age, or a
nonveteran status of the counselor that seems to be the stumbling block.
Some veterans honestly believe no one who has not been through combat
could understand what they still struggle with daily. Others use this issue as
a defense against being rejected or viewed as animals because of what they
did in order to survive while in a combat situation. Yes, it is true that most
people who have not been in combat cannot fully understand it, but no
one—not even another veteran—can completely understand what another's
time in the hell of combat was like. My most competent professional
associate, however, is a young nurse with a master's in counseling. Sue
successfully treats many combat veterans not because she understands
everything about combat, but because she cares and transmits that message
to the veteran. When confronted with this issue, she makes statements
along the line of, "You are right, I was not in combat and do not understand
everything about it. I am willing to listen and understand what it is like for
people to be in pain. I want to try and help. We can go at your pace until
you feel comfortable with me." Such statements usually will begin to
engage the veteran in the counseling relationship.

[p. <i>351</i>]

<b>THE "LET ME TELL YOU</b>


<b>THIS HORROR" ISSUE</b>


Sometimes veterans will attempt very
early in counseling to test the counselor. In a bizarre kind of way, the
veteran almost sets himself up for rejection, which is just the opposite of
what he really wants. Because he has such poor self-esteem and may have
had many rejections by people in his life, it is almost a form of self-punishment
to relate an involvement in an atrocity or vivid description of
the carnage of combat, hoping the counselor will be horrified and hence
either reject or feel the pain of the veteran. His self-evaluation will be
confirmed, and he may then continue to behave in social and/ or antisocial
ways. If the veteran gives gory details with enthusiasm, then further
evaluation of an antisocial personality disorder needs to be considered.
Most veterans who have horror stories take several sessions before they feel
comfortable enough to begin to talk about a traumatic event. Instead of
enthusiastically giving details, the veteran will do it matter of factly,
without emotion, or become very labile and angry while recalling the
events. Usually the anger is verbal but needs to be monitored for escalation,
in which case the counselor may need to apply gentle but firm limit setting.
The counselor needs to keep in mind that all veterans have been trained in
the use of weapons and violence. Those that have been through combat
learned that returned violence was a way to cope with intense fear and
anxiety. By listening with a therapeutic ear and paying attention to one's
own system, the counselor can prevent a blow-up that neither the veteran
nor the counselor would find helpful. If this issue arises or even before it
does, a reading of Haley (1978) can provide guidance.


<b>THE "WHY" ISSUE</b>


Many veterans spend a great deal of
time ruminating about situations looking for the answer to a "why"
question (e.g., Why did Joe, who was married and had a kid, get killed and I
didn't? Why did Tom take my place on point? I should have been hit by the
sniper. Why did that little kid have a live grenade and try to kill my
friends?). As in everyday life, there is often no answer to be found. Why a
bullet missed by an inch and killed the one behind is almost a random event
in combat. Some fatalists will attribute it to "fate." One can almost never
ask the person on the other end of the gun why and receive a response.
Often the "why" questions center on traumatic events with many "shoulds"
and "should not haves." This post facto second guessing may be treated
with the cognitive therapy of the "shoulds" and "should nots" (Ellis &amp;
Grieger, 1977). Veterans want to change the outcome of the traumatic
event and reduce their survival guilt. More global "why" questions may

[p. <i>352</i>]

<b>THE "I FEEL LIKE</b>


<b>EXPLODING" ISSUE</b>


A common problem for veterans is
the buildup of tremendous tension and anxiety. Some veterans turn to
alcohol or drugs as a way to "keep a lid on." Some go looking for trouble in
order to release tension by fighting. Others try to hold it in and control it
but become very irritable and then go into a rage reaction. During the rage,
they may direct much of their energy to verbal harangues, destroying
furniture or structures (more than one veteran has told me about punching
his fist through a plaster wall or kicking down a door), and unfortunately
some have physically abused a significant other. The veteran reports feeling
out of control, and after it is over, feeling guilty and self-deprecatíng.
Teaching relaxation is invaluable. Helping the person learn the cues to
increased tension and teaching other types of control can often defuse the
imminent explosion. The cues need careful investigation to determine the
etiology, the behavioral learning history, and the reinforcement potential
for the explosion. By the time most veterans come into counseling, they
realize their previous coping attempts do not work and often increase the
problems, and they are now willing to try to learn some other techniques.


<b>THE "I AM A VICTIM" ISSUE</b>


This particular issue can take two
forms. In the first form, a veteran will truly believe he is a helpless victim of
traumatic events. There is nothing he can do about it, and so attempts to
deny self-responsibility for his actions and for his efforts to change. He may
express confusion as to what happened and to how he became involved. In
the second way, the victim responds with much anger and frustration, often
directed at those who sent him, those whom he fought alongside with
and/ or against, his family, and in some cases the nation as a whole. When
the "boat people" refugees were brought into this country from Southeast
Asia, many Vietnam veterans viewed it as a personal insult, an affront to
their service. Many negative stereotypes were formed by veterans about the
refugees, based upon lack of information or on overgeneralizations. It

[p. <i>353</i>]

<b>THE "I CANT GET</b>


<b>TOO CLOSE" ISSUE</b>


This issue focuses on difficulties with
relationships that many PTSD veterans have. Many veterans will talk
about how close they had been to certain guys they served with in their
combat units. The comaraderie developed was frequently very strong
because they were sharing life-threatening experiences and depending
upon each other. Fighting not only the enemy, but the threatening elements
of the environment, veterans learned to share their last bit of food or water,
to talk about their plans for the future, and to huddle together to ward off
the elements. Many veterans report feeling closer to their comrades than to
any other friend or even their own brothers. Then in the suddenness of
combat, a friend is killed or horribly maimed. The veteran may experience
intense emotional pain at the loss, but military training does not support
showing those emotions. Later in another engagement, another comrade is
lost, and then another. Each time there is unreleased intense emotional
pain. For many veterans, the emotional pain becomes too much and
psychic numbing or a shutting down of emotions occurs. They no longer
allow themselves to become friends because they do not want to care so
much about anyone again. They develop a belief that if they get close to
someone, that person gets hurt, and the intrapsychic pain is unbearable.
That learning unfortunately becomes transferred to all close relationships.
Upon return from combat, many veterans get on with their lives by
marrying or living with someone. Because they have not resolved their
PTSD issue, they do not easily share positive emotions or profess their love
for their partners. Often the only emotions are irritability, depression, fear,
or rage. Such an emotional environment is generally not conducive to
long-term close relationships. Divorce is a significant problem for many
PTSD veterans.

[p. <i>354</i>]

For Vietnam combat veterans, negative experiences in which children,
women, and elderly were used as weapons by the enemy often led to a
deep-seated mistrust for all strangers. Involvement in atrocities also
instilled dysfunctional behavior based on guilt. Finally, for many veterans
disenchantment and feelings of being used by their government and
country caused feelings of suspiciousness. Then upon return to an
unfriendly, unsympathetic country, strong feelings of alienation developed,
and veterans tended to isolate themselves. Often these veterans talk about
their desire to live "off up in the hills" or "out in the country," away from
everyone. Another common statement is, "I just don't fit in here." Such a
cognitive-affective learning experience makes relationships difficult. In
some ways, it is almost as though the combat veteran went from age 19 to
age 40 without the learning of the intervening years. The veteran's
perceptions of relationships and of how to act his role within a relationship
is clouded by his combat experiences.


The counselor may become involved in a long-term relationship (with
many ups and downs) with a combat veteran. The workings of this
relationship can be generalized to a significant personal relationship of the
veteran. Communication skills, assertiveness skills, affective awareness
training, and anger control may all need to be covered. Cognitive
restructuring work, as well as couples and/or family therapy, may be
needed. The psychological defensive wall erected to keep out emotional
pain needs to be carefully taken down one piece at a time. Beginning to be
aware of emotions may be the first true step in healing and breaking the
chains of the traumatic events from the past.


<b>Other Problems with</b>


<b>Veterans in Counseling</b>


Besides PTSD, there are a few other
problems that often occur in counseling with veterans. These problems are
not related to traumatic events. Instead, they are based on living in a
military society with its peculiar rules and behaviors that can become
deeply ingrained. Arguments could be made about certain personality
characteristics that might lead an individual into the military service. A
high psychological need for order, love of excitement and adventure, a
desire for a camaraderie, self-sacrifice, and patriotism may be just a few.
On the one hand, the military does everything and provides everything.
Just do as one is told to do—don't think; just follow orders. It is a great
provider; the ultimate parental figure. As some old-timers would say, "If
the service wanted you to have a wife, they would have issued you one."
Such mentality or belief system can create certain problems in counseling
with veterans, and several of these problems will be discussed.

[p. <i>355</i>]

The biggest problem is that veterans <i>may not be in contact with their
feelings</i>. Much of counseling focuses on the affective level. But millions
upon millions of veterans have been trained to block out and deny feelings.
Thus a veteran may not be able to discuss how he "feels" about some issue.
He will tell the counselor what he "thinks" about the situation but seems at
a loss to respond about effect. As a counselor, one may need to teach or
offer affective alternatives to sensitize a veteran at the affective level. A
veteran may talk about being uncomfortable but may need careful
intervention to clarify whether he feels depressed, sad, tense, uptight,
angry, frightened, anxious, irritable, explosive, or another affect. By taking
the time to clarify, the counselor helps to educate the veteran and helps him
better understand what is going on inside. A great number of veterans do
not realize how tense/anxious they are until they are taught some
relaxation skills. The idea of stress management provides therapeutic
insight and treatment. Additionally, becoming aware of their affective self
is beneficial, but scary as well.


The <i>fear of becoming emotional</i> is the second problem area often
encountered. The military has trained the veteran to be in command, to
show no weakness, and to know what is right. A super-masculine image is
the standard by which veterans are judged. There is a place for women, and
women should stay in their place. That place is not in the military and
certainly not in combat. The male supremacy is reinforced constantly
throughout their military career, and suddenly in counseling the veteran
"thinks" of himself as a failure. There have been many times veterans have
said to me, "I felt like crying but could not do it." Whether from fear of
losing control or of viewing himself as weak if he cried, the veteran may
initially resist getting in contact with his emotions because he wants to
retain his self-image as a man. Instead of feeling anger at such a
chauvinistic view, the counselor is recommended to view it as a part of the
veteran with which he has not been in touch for a long time. The affective
side is as important for a veteran as it is for any client. Just realize it may
take time to help a veteran find and become accustomed to that new part of
himself.


A third problem is the <i>anomie</i> that many veterans have following
combat or an exciting career in the military. Nothing seems as important,
as challenging, or as exciting as it was during his service time. His level of
responsibility may have gone from being totally responsible for $30 million
worth of equipment and personnel to being the low man in an occupational
setting in which he has no input to decision making. The veteran may also
be having problems adjusting into a"civilian"world. His entire lifestyle has
abruptly changed, yet he may have little insight into any cause-and-effect
relationship between such a change and how he feels. Often a true
adjustment disorder as described in DSM-III is easily diagnosed for retired
or recently released servicemen. Counseling can prove very beneficial to

[p. <i>356</i>]

The final problem centers on issues of <i>authority</i>. Because counseling is
often a new experience for a veteran, he may view the counselor as an
authority figure. As an authority figure, the veteran may want the
counselor to tell him what to do, just as his commanders in the military did.
On the other hand, the veteran may have a need to resist the counselor
because he is tired of "taking orders." In either case, the counselor will
benefit from explaining what counseling or psychotherapy is about and
what each member's role is in the therapeutic relationship. For many
veterans the idea of counseling is anathema because in the military, seeking
counseling was thought to lead to loss of a security clearance and hence the
end of a chance for promotion. Difficulty taking orders may develop in a
new work situation because the veteran may view the boss as inept or not
knowing that there is a better way to do things. (Better in terms of the way it
was done in the military.) The old military formula of instilling discipline—
"kick ass and take names"—does not transfer to the civilian world. No
longer does military rank provide power to command with the military
justice system to back up orders with punishments for those who failed to
respond. Again, reality therapy can be useful. Playing on the veteran's
pride can also be used by the counselor. By pointing out to a veteran that in
his long, successful career, he made many moves and served under many
commanders, the counselor can point out to the veteran how he learned to
adapt in each new situation. After achieving agreement with that point, the
counselor can discuss with the veteran what the new environment is like
and what he needs to do to succeed. Usually such an approach removes the
blinders (resistance) for the veteran, and he can begin working on his
adjustment. Not everything is "black and white," as many veterans believe.
There are grays, and there are different ways of dealing with authority.


A subissue under authority is a veteran who runs his family as he did his
military unit. Spit and polish, Saturday morning inspection, stern discipline,
a "yes, sir; no, sir; no excuse, sir" environment often leads to family
problems and needs to be dealt with in family therapy. There needs to be
work done on the ego differentiation between the service and the family
when the veteran becomes too authoritarian. It may be difficult to move
him from his rigidity, but he would probably not be in counseling unless he
wanted to change.

When faced with a veteran client
whose main concerns are veteran related, it may be helpful to refer the
veteran to a Veterans Administration facility within reasonable distance or
at least provide a phone number to the veteran for him to call and check on
his eligibility for treatment. It may prove beneficial for the counselor to call
and consult with a psychologist, social worker, psychiatric nurse clinical
specialist, or a psychiatrist about a particular case. If one is located in or
near a large metropolitan center, there is probably a VA facility there. If
not, then one can call the following telephone number to obtain the phone
number of the nearest facility: VA INFORMATION—(202) 233-4000.


Similarly, if working with a Vietnam veteran or any combat veteran, a
consultation with or referral to a local Vet Center may be of benefit. A Vet
Center is an outreach counseling center providing free counseling services
to veterans who are still struggling with their combat experiences. PTSD is
the largest category of presenting problems and the reason the Vet Centers
were created. Call the same VA information number and ask to talk with
someone familiar with Vet Centers.


If the counselor wants or needs to do a PTSD evaluation, there are
several available. Figley's (1978) Appendix B has a suggested format
focusing primarily on Vietnam but is easily adopted to other traumatic
events with a few word changes. Another format is provided by Scurfield
and Blank (1985) to obtain a good military history.


<b>Conclusion</b>


Veterans are people who have been
through some special experiences that have affected their lives. Although
many veterans are resistant to counseling/psychotherapy, they often
become appreciative clients who respond well to counselors' efforts. Do
not try to fool them or not be "up-front" with them. Their experiences,
especially in combat, seem to allow them to know when someone is not
being honest with them. They often present a very stern, gruff exterior and
much pain can be seen in their eyes. Combat certainly ages them beyond
their years. Some problems they present may seem intractable because of
the many intervening years. An empathic counselor can often ease their
burden, simply by caring and showing a willingness to listen. As Fielder
(1950) indicated, it does not seem to matter which therapy or technique of
counseling is utilized, the concern of one human being—the counselor—
for another—the client—appears to be the most important therapeutic
factor. As with most clients, if treated with dignity, they respond with
dignity. Veterans have shouldered the nation's burdens and at times may
