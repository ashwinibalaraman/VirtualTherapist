Although group work with gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgendered (GLBT)
clients is commonplace in large metropolitan
cities and on university campuses,
research discussing group dynamics, processes,
and outcomes of group work with GLBT populations
is scarce. DeBord and Perez's (2000)
review revealed only six relevant research articles
(Everaerd et al., 1982; Hedge &amp; Glover,
1990; Mulder et al., 1994; Quadland, 1985;
Reece, 1981/1982; Russell &amp; Winkler, 1977),
all of which focused solely on men, and five of
which focused upon either sexual dysfunction
or HIV-positive men. Only two were published
as recently as the early 1990s. Seven research
studies investigating cognitive-behavioral
skills training, stress management, culturally
appropriate brief group therapy, and cognitive-
behavioral therapy in combination with medication
have since been published (Choi et al.,
1996; Lee, Cohen, Hadley, &amp; Goodwin, 1999;
Roffman et al., 1997; Roffman, Beadnell, Ryan,
&amp; Downey, 1995; Roffman, Downey, Beadnell,
&amp; Gordon, 1997; Roffman, Ficciano, Bolan, &amp;
Kalishman, 1997; Schneiderman, 1999). Again,
all studies focused on men and HIV prevention
and treatment.


There have been a few theoretical articles
based on case studies of group work with gay,
lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) populations (e. g.,
Chojnacki &amp; Gelberg, 1995). In addition to
DeBord and Perez's (2000) chapter on group
therapy with GLBT individuals, which focused
primarily on Yalom's therapeutic factors
(1995), Norsworthy and Home (1994) discussed
groups with HIV-positive men, Perez (1996)
provided guidelines for the development of
groups for HIV-positive university students, and
Baum and Fishman (1994) described a group
treatment approach for sexually compulsive gay
men. More recent contributions include case
studies of male sexual abuse survivor groups
of mixed sexual orientation (Meyer, 2000),
accounts of gay men discussing their experiences

[p. <i>225</i>]

Although it is commonly acknowledged
that GLBT individuals access therapeutic
services to a significant degree (Bradford, Ryan,
&amp; Rothblum, 1994; Liddle, 1996; Morgan,
1992), much less is known about GLBT group
work. Groups commonly advertised in GLBT
community newspapers and on university campuses
include HIV support groups, coming-out
groups, and more recently, gay and lesbian parenting
groups. Group counseling is beneficial to
GLBT individuals in a number of ways. Given
the isolation that many GLBT people experience
due to the stigmatization of their sexual
and gender identities, groups can offer an
atmosphere conducive to sharing universality of
experience (Yalom, 1995). Because many
GLBT individuals experience disruptions in
their families of origin during the coming-out
process, groups can also provide instillation
of hope for members to work through changing
relationships. Groups also provide an opportunity
to observe and imitate other members'
skills and strategies for integrating and disclosing
sexual and gender identities to significant
others. Finally, groups for GLBT individuals
allow for interpersonal learning among
members, the development of socializing techniques
that are necessary for successful integra
of a new identity, and the imparting of vitaltion
information about GLBT concerns to group
members (DeBord &amp; Perez, 2000).


The purpose of this chapter is to outline
important issues to consider when leading
groups that include or focus upon GLBT clients.
In general, the dynamics and process in groups
with GLBT clients are similar to group work in
general. However, this chapter highlights the
differences that are important within this type of
group. Because GLBT clients face issues of
discrimination and isolation that may be unique,
it is important for counselors to be sensitized to
these experiences. Throughout the chapter,
insights from the authors' clinical experience
and the professional literature will serve to
highlight the main points.


GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RELEVANT
TO GROUP WORK WITH GLBT CLIENTS


Coming Out


Facilitators for GLBT groups need an awareness
of the issues and challenges that GLBT
individuals regularly face. Generally, GLBT
individuals go through a "coming-out" process
that involves disclosing to self and significant
others their sexual or gender identities (Brown
&amp; Rounsley, 1996; Cass, 1979). During this
process, many individuals are faced with uncertainty,
fear, and anxiety, which can contribute to
clinical depression and social isolation. Groups
can serve to foster positive self-identity by
exposing group members to the varied developmental
processes of others. Members with solid
GLBT identities can model positive identity
development to emerging GLBT members.
Group leaders should be aware, however, that
for many people, the coming-out process is
lengthy and nonlinear; at times, individuals will
fluctuate from being very comfortable with their
GLBT identities but then can be set back by a
negative self-disclosure or event.


Discrimination Based on
Sexual or Gender Orientation


In most states, there is no protection for
GLBT individuals against employment discrimination,
meaning that mere participation in a
GLBT group could jeopardize job security if
confidentiality is breached. Many states and
municipal governments discriminate against
GLBT people by denying custody of children,
refusing adoption to GLBT individuals (e.g.,
Florida's anti-adoption policy), and limiting
access to housing (Barón &amp; Cramer, 2000). In
addition to overt discrimination, GLBT individuals
are at risk for losing social support of
family members, friends, or religious affiliations
if their sexual or gender identity is made
known (Savin-Williams, 1998). Even in a

Structuring Effective
Group Work With GLBT Clients


<i>Group Facilitator Personal Preparation</i>


Group facilitators should have examined their
own biases and assumptions regarding sexual and
gender orientation. Because heterosexist attitudes
and norms are prevalent in the United States,
most people harbor some heterosexist beliefs
and assumptions regarding GLBT individuals.
Heterosexual group leaders can explore their attitudes
and beliefs by spending time and asking
questions of GLBT friends and acquaintances,
reading GLBT narratives and fiction, and visiting
GLBT Web sites (e.g., www.glsen.org, www.
pflag.org). GLBT facilitators should examine and
consider their own possible internalized homophobia
while seeking out accurate information
about unfamiliar GLBT groups. At the same
time, facilitators should not commit an alpha bias
in relation to GLBT individuals (the belief that
enduring differences in problems and concerns
characterizes heterosexuals and GLBT individuals,
thereby exaggerating dissimilarities and
dichotomizing orientations) nor a beta bias (minimizes
and dismisses concerns unique to GLBT
individuals) (Hare-Mustin &amp; Marecek, 1988).


Group facilitators should also be aware of
their own developmental processes, whether
heterosexual or GLBT identified. Chojnacki and
Gelberg (1995) described a parallel process of
coming out for heterosexual group leaders and
GLBT individuals. The process encompasses
confusion for the counselor who is just becoming
aware of the oppression of GLBT individuals
and is engaged secretly in GLBT work; fear
and anxiety about becoming a GLBT ally;
increasing activism and advocacy on the part of
the GLBT community; pride concerning their
roles as advocates while experiencing increased
alienation from homophobic colleagues; and
finally, a sense of professional and personal
integration as the leader's values become more
congruent with their relationships and activities
as advocates and allies. Many individuals find
it helpful to participate in groups that include
only GLBT individuals in order to explore and
understand issues unique to their communities.
Group facilitators may find that the initial structure
of the group has a great influence on the
ensuing process and outcome. When forming a
group, facilitators may wish to consider issues
such as consent, confidentiality, members'
out-of-group contact, disclosure, group purpose
and theme, and membership. Considerations
relevant to groups that include GLBT members
as well as for homogeneous GLBT groups are
discussed.


<i>Recruitment of Members: Informed Consent</i>


A clear purpose of the group statement is to
recruit members and build group cohesion. It is
also important to indicate in any advertisements
that the group is affirmative toward GLBT individuals.
Despite the ethical guidelines put forth
by official organizations of helping professionals
(e.g., American Psychological Association,
American Counseling Association, etc.) that
explicitly repudiate therapies who attempt to
convert same-sex identified individuals to heterosexual
identities (conversion and reparative
therapies), these therapists proliferate throughout
the United States. GLBT individuals are aware
of these conversion efforts and will be more
inclined to follow up with an ad that states at the
outset that the group is affirmative in its approach
to GLBT individuals. The advertisement
should also describe the theme of the group
(e.g., transgendered support group, safe-sex

[p. <i>227</i>]

CONFIDENTIALITY:
STRUCTURING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT


For GLBT groups in particular, there is no more
important issue than establishing and maintaining
confidentiality. Group leaders should state
the limits of confidentiality, making members
fully aware of the consequences of breaching
confidentiality agreements (e.g., expulsion from
the group). Group members should determine
what course of action to take if members and
leaders are encountered outside of group or if
group members' names are mentioned by a nongroup
member. These rules should be clearly
established, and consensus reached among
members.


Facilitators should not assume that all
members of groups have the same respect and
level of concern about confidentiality. For
example, some GLBT individuals maintain that
being out about one's sexual or gender orientation
in all spheres of life is essential for mental
health and well-being. Such group members
may believe that "outing" members who are
closeted would be beneficial to their psychological
adjustment. Such a practice could be
extremely damaging to members who are at risk
if their identities are revealed; therefore, this
possibility should be discussed as a group.
Preinterview screening is vital to ensuring that
all members will be equally sensitive to the
importance of maintaining group confidentiality.
Individuals who are accepted to join a group
should sign a statement of confidentiality that
describes the limits and value of confidentiality
and asks all group members to adhere to this
value. The implications of breaches of confidentiality
should be described to members.
Leaders may ask the group to explore the
consequences of breaking confidentiality.
Confidentiality should be discussed periodically
in the group, as the need arises.


Issues Around Out-of-Group Contact


Members should negotiate about what to do if
they meet outside the group context by chance
and come to a consensus on whether they wish
to have relationships among group members
outside of group sessions (e.g., social meetings,
Internet exchanges, etc.) or to contain their interactions
within the group setting. Holahan and
Gibson (1994) caution that the likelihood of
interaction outside of the group is generally quite
high, given the small size of GLBT communities,
even in large cities; thus, group members
need to decide if the restriction of outside-group
contact is a realistic or desired goal. Again, it
will be important that all group members agree
to the final decision, which may include a
timeline for acceptable contact after the group's
termination. For psychoeducational and coming-
out groups (many individuals join coming-out
groups to make their initial contacts with the
GLBT community), limiting outside contact
may not be beneficial or even reasonable for
group members. However, with counseling and
psychotherapy groups, facilitators should prioritize
group discussion and consensus on outside
contact due to the nature of the group.


Group Facilitators'
Orientations and Disclosure


Leaders of groups should be expected to
disclose their sexual/gender orientations during
the initial screening interview. By doing so,
leaders can enhance trust and model openness.
If leaders are heterosexual, an immediate
disclosure in combination with a description of
the development of their interest in and support

[p. <i>228</i>]

TYPES OF GLBT GROUPS


Psychoeducational vs. Counseling


Although psychoeducational and counseling
groups can be distinguished by their respective
goals, these aims may overlap in homogeneous
GLBT groups. The goal of psychoeducational
groups is to impart information that promotes
personal growth and the prevention of specific
problems through here-and-now interaction
with group members who may be at risk for the
particular identified problem (ASGW, 1998;
Gazda, Ginter, &amp; Home, 2001). In contrast, a
counseling group is one in which facilitators use
theoretical strategies to address interpersonal
development issues with members who may be
experiencing temporary adjustment issues or are
interested in personal enhancement. At times,
psychoeducational groups will need to take on
aspects of a counseling group even though
psychoeducation remains the primary focus.
For example, in an HIV prevention group that is
providing information on safe-sex procedures, a
member may need to discuss the loss of a partner
who would not engage in new relational
safe-sex rules. Likewise, during a counseling
group, if a member were to share lack of
knowledge concerning safe-sex practices,
leaders and members might share information
and concerns about safe-sex practices.


Group Topic: Theme-Specific
and General Interpersonal Groups


If group members are highly verbal and
self-aware, the group may not need a great deal
of direction to function smoothly. These groups
typically consist of individuals who have
worked through their coming-out processes and
are engaged in considerations of career, relationships,
and meaning.


Some counseling groups work best, however,
with weekly themes, either leader or
member generated. These groups often consist
of members who are early in their coming-out
processes, such as adolescents or university
students. Usually, members welcome structure
as long as the group is flexible to emerging concerns
that should take precedence over weekly
themes (e.g., the concerns of a young lesbian
who is kicked out of her home when her sexual
identity is revealed to her family should be prioritized
over a weekly theme such as dating).
Weekly themes can increase participation by
group members with topics that generally are
avoided in general interpersonal groups, such as
hate crimes, safe sex, and intimacy.


Membership: Men vs. Women


The literature discusses a variety of GLBT
groups, some consisting of mixed groups of men
and women and others that favor homogeneous
gender groups (Perez, DeBord, &amp; Brock, 1999).
The purpose of the group should determine gender
makeup. Obviously, a psychoeducational group
focusing on issues of conception and fertility clinic
usage would typically include lesbian and bisexual
women, whereas a "considering parenthood"
group could include both men and women.
Increasingly, parenting groups are including both
men and women together as gay and bisexual
fathers become more common. At the adolescent
and university age level, mixed groups often are
beneficial. They highlight universal concerns of
GLBT men and women and help increase support
networks at a vulnerable developmental stage.


Membership: Gay, Lesbian,
Bisexual, or Transgendered


Differences among GLBT individuals are
important to consider when working with

[p. <i>229</i>]

GROUP PROCESS ISSUES


Identity Formation: Respecting
the Developmental Process


There is great diversity within GLBT populations
in the ways individuals understand and
discuss their sexual and gender orientations.
While some group members may be quick to
identify themselves in one category, others may
be reluctant to label themselves or may be struggling
with identity issues. Appreciating the
gradual process of building a sexual and gender
identity will allow leaders to recognize and
accept clients as they explore these themes.


Facilitators should be familiar with stage
models of sexual identity development (e.g.,
Brady &amp; Busse, 1994; Brown, 1995; Cass,
1979; Coleman, 1987; McCarn &amp; Fassinger,
1996; Troiden, 1989). These models describe
processes of GLBT identity acceptance, synthesis
with other identities, and increasing GLBT
group affiliation. An awareness of these models
can help leaders understand and normalize
differences among members' own development.
At the same time, these models should be used
as guides and should not blind facilitators to the
idiosyncratic processes of development among
group members (for a critique of the application
of contemporary sexual identity models, see
Fassinger, 2000). Based on research on a sexual
identity group that did not employ a GLBT title,
Home, Levitt, and Leitner (2003) asserted
that groups can be more inclusive of GLBT
members if they reflect the diversity represented
within these stage models of identity. Many
individuals would not identify as GLBT until
they fell into later stages or phases of the various
sexual identity models. If groups assume
that a coherent GLBT identity is already formed
prior to beginning a group, they may exclude
those members who are most in need of supportive
exploration, such as clients who are
unsure or ambivalent about their identities.


<i>Not Being "Label-Ready</i>. " In initial stages of
sexual identity development, group members
may not be ready to assume labels describing
their gender or sexual identities. They may be
sexually inexperienced, hold internalized homophobic
beliefs or attitudes, or may fear external
reactions. Adopting a title for a counseling
group that does not assume a fixed identity,
such as "Exploring Sexual Identity," invites
members at earlier stages to join. In a postcounseling
qualitative interview (Home et al., 2003),
one member of one such university group
reported, "I don't think I would have attended a
group, at that point, named 'les/gay/bi.' I just
wouldn't have wanted to identify.... And even
if I had decided to come, I wouldn't have started
the conversations I did with other people—
I wouldn't have been saying, 'I'm going to this
GLBT group,' you know, whereas I could say,
'I'm going to this sexual identity exploration
group'" (p. 13).


<i>Active Rejection of Labels</i>. Group leaders may
encounter many members who object to categorizing
themselves within a sexual or gender
identity label. To allow group members freedom
to explore and shape their own identities,
leaders will need to accept the ambiguity that
this represents. They may wish to overtly
encourage members to take their time in coming
to sexual or gender identities congruent with

[p. <i>230</i>]

<i>Coming Out</i>. Counselors should be aware of the
complexity of the coming-out process for group
members. Often, the initial disclosure to family
or friends is the beginning of a long and involved
process. Multiple layers of emotion may be
triggered, such as relief, anxiety, fear, and pride,
which can be explored in a group setting.
Leaders need to be careful that the group does
not "push" or use "peer pressure" to get
members to come out. The dangers and the risks
need to be fully explored and assessed, both on
a general societal level and on a personal level.
Group members can help prepare one another to
come out, if this is a shared goal. Role-playing
disclosure and sharing experiences of coming
out can be beneficial in a member's preparation.
A client who has just come out may require the
group's attention and support for the majority
of a group session to come to terms with their
changing relationships. It may be important to
check for safety concerns, especially with
GLBT youth who are at increased risk of familial
rejection and homelessness. Because family
and friends also go though their own process in
reaction to a member's coming out, leaders may
wish to prepare members to expect reactions to
shift over time, in either positive or negative
directions. Leaders may find themselves
confronted with different emotional reactions
from the same group members from week to
week as they negotiate changing relationships.


After one group member shares a coming-out
story, other group members may experience
heightened anxiety about their own coming-out
processes. Leaders may invite group members to
share their personal reactions and reflect upon
the way these affect their own stories. They can
discuss the process of coming out in a prospective
sense as well, as individuals may have to
make decisions about coming out repeatedly
throughout their lives. Members can discuss pros
and cons to coming out in different situations
and can share strategies that they use to assess
safety concerns and weigh them in against personal
and political needs to be visible.


DIVERSITY AND SPECIAL
GROUPS WITHIN GLBT POPULATIONS


DeLucia-Waack (1996) pointed out the erroneous
belief that groups are ever homogeneous,
given the numerous ways group members can
differ multiculturally, such as age, ethnicity, and
socioeconomic backgrounds. Leaders should be
prepared to address diversity issues within any
GLBT group they organize. Members of culturally
diverse groups may experience oppression
on multiple levels. Helping members to negotiate
the intersection of these identities is an
important part of group work. Important spheres
of difference to consider include race, age,
spirituality, class, and disability. Leaders of any
type of group may wish to make available contact
information for organizations that provide
resources and support for diverse subgroups
within the GLBT community.


<i>GLBT Youth Issues: Needing Support</i>.
Organizing a group for GLBT youth requires
preliminary research into the state laws about
parental consent and providing counseling to
youth. States have different laws about the
necessity of consent when it places a child at
risk; however, many youth do not feel safe
enough to disclose their sexual orientations to
parents. To provide needed services for GLBT
youth, counselors may act as facilitators for peer

[p. <i>231</i>]

In addition to the same developmental
concerns that all adolescents face, GLBT adolescents'
lives can also be complicated by a
number of severe Stressors. Much research has
documented the elevated rates of depression
and anxiety that GLBT youth experience (e.g.,
D'Augelli &amp; Hershberger, 1993). They are at
high risk for substance abuse (e.g., Grossman &amp;
Kerner, 1998), physical and verbal harassment
by family members (e.g., Pilkington &amp;
D'Augelli, 1995), homelessness (Kruks, 1991),
HIV-positive status (e.g., Rotheram-Borus,
Hunter, &amp; Rosario, 1994), and suicide attempts
(Garofolo, Wolf, Kessel, Palfrey, &amp; DuRant,
1998). Facilitators should screen carefully for
suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety before
the group starts, as well as periodically throughout
the group. Although group members may
need to discuss challenges unique to their sexual
or gender identities, they often want to discuss
normal developmental concerns, such as career,
dating, and social relationships.


For youth in particular, it can be important
to respect the process of negotiating labels.
Hollander (2000) stressed the importance of
supporting "questioning" youth by not superimposing
rigid developmental models on their
growth, and providing them with school support
programs that build alliances among youth
regardless of sexual identity or orientation.
Facilitators' modeling of comfort is important,
as the youth may be seeking clues about life as
an adult, especially if the leader is GLBT. They
may be inquisitive and may use humor to try to
learn about the leader's life choices and day-to-day
life. Leaders may decide to self-disclose by
describing examples from their own lives but
should be clear that there are varieties of ways
healthy GLBT adults structure their lives and
that a broader view is also helpful.


Also, leaders should have consistent boundaries
about self-disclosure and its potential
impact on youth. They should refrain from providing
overly personal information and from
framing their own choices as sole alternatives.
For instance, a group leader who identifies as
lesbian may want to make clear she views all
other identities as equally valid, as well as the
process of coming to an identity or the decision
not to identify using a sexual orientation label.


<i>Age</i>. Aging can be an isolating experience, in
particular for GLBT individuals. Research suggests
that gay men may determine self-worth
according to chronological age more so than
lesbians or heterosexual individuals (Kimmel &amp;
Sang, 1995) and that such self-estimations lead
to "accelerated aging," the defining of oneself
as old earlier than one's chronological age
(Friend, 1987). Facilitators can counter and discourage
statements that suggest members are
"past their prime." As older GLBT individuals
become more visible in public life, this tendency
toward accelerated aging may decrease.


At present, there are few resources for senior
GLBT community members. Elderly GLBT
individuals may feel hesitant about using
resources that are not clearly GLBT-friendly,
especially after being raised in an era that was
more heterosexist. At the same time, facilitators
should be aware of "cohort effects," the influences
of various political and historical conditions
that affect identity formation across
generations. Many GLBT individuals who are
older than 70 grew up during a time of very limited
openness about sexual orientation and may
actually experience discomfort in participating
in activities labeled for GLBT individuals.
Facilitators should take historical context into
consideration for older adult GLBT individuals
when it comes to identity discussion and formation
(Barón &amp; Cramer, 2000). It may also be
challenging for senior GLBT individuals to
ensure legal safeguards for medical care, longterm
partner care, and death and dying issues if
they are not accustomed to discussing sexual or
gender orientation with health care and legal

[p. <i>232</i>]

<i>Race/Ethnicity</i>. Therapists who are in tune with
the ways oppression shapes minority clients'
identities and who possess multicultural counseling
competencies will be better prepared to
guide group members to integrate their GLBT
identities with their racial and ethnic identities.
The decision to disclose sexual or gender
identity to racial group members may be more
threatening for GLBT people of color, as they
may risk rejection from their racial group, in
addition to other forms of discrimination.
According to Morales (1989), LGB people of
color balance three identities, "the gay/lesbian
community, the ethnic minority community,
and the predominantly white, mainstream
society" (p. 217).


GLBT members who are part of a minority
racial or ethnic group may face additional conflicts,
as aspects of their minority identities or
cultures may conflict with their sexual or gender
identities. Adopting a gay identity, for example,
may therefore mean relinquishing one's ties
to one's ethnic community. Similarly, claiming
an ethnic identity within a dominantly White
GLBT community may leave individuals feeling
as if part of their identity is not supported,
and they may experience oppression within the
GLBT community. In the group context, raising
the topic of multiple oppressions can give
members permission to share experiences of
racism in relation to heterosexism and to explicate
cultural differences within the group.
GLBT group members of color may be able to
share with White group members their strategies
for managing oppression in their daily lives
and contribute to the group's resources, as well
as broaden group members' perspectives on
oppression.


Some ethnic minority people who engage in
same-sex behavior do not adopt GLBT identities
because the adoption of such an identity
may be seen as assimilation into White culture
(Tsang, 1994; Zamora-Hernandez &amp; Patterson,
1996). Group facilitators should be cautious
about encouraging members to adopt labels that
are not congruent with their sense of self.


<i>Spirituality</i>. Contrary to popular accounts of dissonance
between religious beliefs and GLBT
identities, recent research (Noffsinger-Frazier &amp;
Home, 2003) suggests that many GLBT individuals
reconcile their spirituality and sexual
orientations. In group contexts, it can be important
for group members to share the different
ways their faith beliefs can change as they adopt
a positive sexual or gender identity. It has been
found that gay men are quicker to come out
when they have integrated their spiritual beliefs
with their sexual identities (Wagner, Serafini,
Rabkin, Remien, &amp; Williams, 1994). It can be
very painful, however, for many members to
sever attachments to their faith or congregation
in search of an affirming place of worship. The
group process can be used to help members
identify their spiritual needs and to become
aware of a broader set of options available to
them within their communities (Home &amp;
Noffsinger-Frazier, 2003).


<i>Class</i>. There is very little research available on
class and sexual and gender orientation (Barón
&amp; Cramer, 2000). GLBT groups are often provided
through university counseling centers,
and thus, clients of lower socioeconomic status
(SES) and education may not have easy access
to these services and may not feel comfortable
attending groups in these settings. Group
leaders should be aware that GLBT groups with
different SES status may have different cultural
characteristics. For instance, "butch-femme"
identities historically have been associated with
lower-SES communities, with upper-class
neighboring lesbian communities blending into
heterosexual models of femininity (Faderman,
1991), although this trend may be changing
(see Levitt &amp; Horne, 2002). There can be differences
in group members' abilities to access

[p. <i>233</i>]

<i>Disability</i>. Disability creates additional Stressors
for GLBT clients to manage. For the physically
disabled, it may be more difficult to access
resources and information to support their sexual
or gender identities (Caitlin &amp; Futterman,
1997). Boden (1992) suggested that the shame
surrounding disability could compound the
shame associated with sexual or gender differences.
However, Ketz and Home (2003) found
that lesbians with disabilities reported better
sexual self-concepts than heterosexual disabled
women, suggesting that a lesbian identity could
be a mitigating factor that helps to reduce
shame-based sexual self-constructs induced by
disability status in an able-bodied world. The
emphasis in many lesbian communities on sexual
self-acceptance and respect for diversity
may serve as a buffer for stigma associated with
disability status. Group leaders should talk to
potential group members in preinterviews about
accessibility and participation needs (e.g.,
American Sign Language interpreters or wheelchair
accessibility). They should promote an
atmosphere that dispels myths about disability
and encourages disabled members to communicate
their sexual and social needs.


<i>Bisexual and Transgender Identity: Difference
Doubled</i>. Bisexual and transgendered individuals
often face double marginalization. Bisexual
clients can experience rejection within heterosexual
society because of their potential for
same-sex attractions. At the same time, they
may face discrimination within gay and lesbian
communities because of the misconceptions that
bisexuals should commit to a gay or lesbian
identity or that bisexuality itself is not a "genuine"
orientation. To ensure safety in group
contexts, bisexual clients will need to have their
acceptance guaranteed, whether they are
involved with same-sex or other-sex partners.
It will be important to discuss the acceptance
of group members' sexual diversity in all
preinterviews.


Transgendered individuals may find it
difficult to use GLB resources because of their
nontraditional gender status. They may identify
as heterosexual but be seeking support for their
cross-gender presentation. Alternatively, they
may identify as homosexual and have a gender
presentation that is consistent with a GLB
identity, such as "drag queen." It is important
for facilitators to determine an individual's
needs. If clients are seeking the resources that
are being offered by the group, they should be
incorporated as members. Therapists should
discuss with these clients in a preinterview the
amount of disclosure they desire. If needed,
facilitators should refer them to an appropriate
group but do so with attention to the many different
identities that are subsumed by the broad
rubric <i>transgender</i>. For instance, many cities
have transitioning female-to-male groups, but a
masculine-appearing lesbian who identifies as
butch may be misplaced in such a group and
should be given other alternatives to explore her
gender identity (e.g., Levitt &amp; Bigler, 2003). It
can be important for leaders to realize that
although some transgendered individuals may
wish to undergo sex-reassignment surgery and
hormone treatments to change their bodies to
match their internal experiences, others may be
looking to develop healthy and positive identities
without any interest in medical intervention.


<i>HIV-Positive Groups</i>. Although HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS (acquired
immune deficiency syndrome) are blind to sexual
orientation and gender, this illness has
caused particular devastation within the male
gay and bisexual community. Different types of
group interventions have been developed
specifically for this population, including support,
psychoeducational, and prevention groups.


The stigma facing individuals with HIV/AIDS
remains a formidable obstacle for individuals
seeking diagnosis and treatment. Berger, Ferrane,
and Lashley (2001) suggested that HIV/AIDS
stigma is made up of four components: personalized
stigma, concerns about disclosure, self-image,
and concern with public attitudes toward
HIV individuals. Issues relating to stigma will be
important topics of conversation as individuals
work to retain or develop a positive sense of self
and their homosexual histories.

[p. <i>234</i>]

Because of this stigma, support groups for
HIV/AIDS-infected individuals differ from
groups for other diseases. Although there have
been many promising developments in the treatment
of HIV and AIDS and life expectancy has
been extended considerably, there still is no
cure for the virus, and so individuals struggle
with existential as well as social issues. The
opportunity to come together with others who
share similar struggles with the virus can be
empowering, educational, and may lead to
activism. Supportive therapy can be effective
not only for individuals with HIV/AIDS but
also for those mourning the loss of AIDS
victims (e.g., de Ridder, 1999).


There have been many varieties of psychoeducational
group formats that have been
developed to prevent HIV/AIDS within specific
populations. Telephone groups have targeted
closeted men (e.g., Roffman, Beadnell, et
al., 1995), and hip-hop groups have been created
for African American adolescents
(Stephens, Braithwaite, &amp; Taylor, 1998). In
addition to ethnicity, groups have targeted sexually
compulsive men having difficulty implementing
safety precautions in their sexual
practices (Baum &amp; Fishman, 1994). Choi et al.
(1996) identified four main goals of prevention
group work: the development of self-identity
and social support, safe-sex education, the
eroticization of safe sex, and the negotiation of
safe sex. Research indicates that these groups
do appear to promote safer-sex practices and
greater awareness of risk (e.g., Sorenson,
London, &amp; Morales, 1991).


It may be most efficacious to form groups
that are exclusive in terms of the stage of illness,
risk behaviors, and gender of members (see
Siebert &amp; Dorfman, 1995). At initial stages of
HIV/AIDS, individuals have to come to terms
with integrating this illness into their own identities.
Initially, group members will need to bolster
one another's sense of hope, which may be
difficult if confronted with other members in the
latter stages of AIDS. Similarly, it may be difficult
for members who have later-stage AIDS
and are negotiating physical and treatment Stressors
to have a sense of group cohesion with
members who are asymptomatic. For end-stage
AIDS, in the case of victims who may not be
able to come together physically, Rittner and
Hammons (1992) discussed the use of group
telephone therapy. These conversations can
allow members a place to discuss issues related
to impending death, interpersonal disengagement,
frustration with the medical community,
and living with illness. With the increasingly
popular use of the Internet as a therapeutic tool,
online groups may be another possible solution
for clients with end-stage AIDS.


The risk factors that lead to the development
of HIV/AIDS can be used to guide the formation
of groups as well. Heterosexual individuals
who have HIV/AIDS may have to deal with the
stigma of having this illness but without the
same attribution of blame that gay men face
(Herek &amp; Capitanio, 1999). Individuals who
contracted HIV/AIDS through drug use may
require group support to resist continued addiction
risks. By designing groups specific to risk
group, the challenges facing members may be
explored more deeply and without comparison
to other processes.


It can be advantageous to restrict groups by
gender as well. HIV/AIDS may hold different
meanings for women and men (see Green, 1996;
Siebert &amp; Dorfman, 1995). Women may require
their own groups to reshape their sense of gender
and sexuality; and group supports may be
important for women with HIV/AIDS with
children to explore their experiences and concerns
in mothering (e.g., Edell, 1998).


<i>Heterogeneous Groups With GLBT Group
Members</i>. In addition to the concerns above,
there are other concerns relevant for group
facilitators who are conducting mixed groups
of heterosexual and GLBT clients. In the
screening interview, leaders should ask GLBT
clients if they are comfortable self-disclosing
their sexual orientations or gender identities
within the group. Similarly, group leaders
should inquire of potential heterosexual
members their comfort level with diversity and
varied sexual identities. Facilitators should
screen these members for signs of heterosexism
or overt homophobia, although it may not necessarily
keep a potential member from joining,
as acquaintanceships with GLBT individuals
can be one of the most effective ways to
counter heterosexism (Mohr &amp; Sedlacek,
2000). The inclusion of these members does

[p. <i>235</i>]

CONCLUSION


Although in most respects, working with GLBT
clients will be similar to working with heterosexual
clients, it is important for counselors to
be prepared to deal with unique issues and concerns
that operate in tandem with oppression
that many GLBT individuals experience.
Because the source of difference for GLBT
clients can be invisible, clients may not have
terms to describe their experiences. Because
GLBT experiences are usually not raised within
a context of other minority groups, individuals
may have internalized a great deal of heterosexist
prejudices without buffers or role models
from family and community. Group leaders will
need to form, shape, and conduct groups with an
eye to revealing the biases within the culture at
large and within group members themselves. By
allowing for the discussion of oppression at
multiple levels and valuing the differences
between group members, group facilitators can
allow members to shape identities that are congruent
with their experiences and to become
resilient in the face of future obstacles.
