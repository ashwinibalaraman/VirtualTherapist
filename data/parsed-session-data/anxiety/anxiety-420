THE MAELSTROM OF LIFE drew me down. Deeper
and deeper, faster and faster, unseen forces spirited
me along a precarious course. I had no
choice but to submit and wait.


The last crisis was long in coming, and then
suddenly the end was upon me. There was no
mistaking the fact.


This occurred on Wednesday afternoon, December
23, 1959. I had awakened that morning
unusually tired and oppressed and remained in

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

First I had seen a small, closed book with a
hard cover.


Then I had seen a field of Michaelmas daisies
being cut, Michaelmas daisies such as grew in
profusion in our garden.


Next I had intimations of a terrifying play
which seemed purposely designed to frighten me.


Then I heard a voice calling and I ran to answer.


Last of all I tasted wine and it was so hot that I
couldn&apos;t swallow it.


What did all this mean?


Responsibility weighed heavily on me. I felt
myself entrusted to receive, remember and record
my dreams and intuitions correctly.


As soon as I arose I made an entry of these
latest dreams in my journal and pondered the
progression of previous ones.


My <i>house</i>, which had given me much trouble
over the years at last appeared in fairly good
order. Apparently I had finished <i>school</i>, and was
now engaged in a theatrical project of some sort.


In early dreams whenever I saw rooms, theaters
or auditoriums, they were always either
empty or only a few seats were occupied. Now
whenever I saw such places every seat was occupied.

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

According to my dreams the one undertaking
still to be accomplished was the <i>performance</i>
about which I dreamed so often and could learn
so little. Whoever or whatever controlled my
dreams was cleverly secretive about the <i>play</i>,
hinting that I had a small part, intimating that I
might have to act as a substitute, bewildering me
as to my role and even seeming to enjoy my
plight.


From one dream I gathered that a performance
had been held but had been unsuccessful. However,
I was led to believe that two more performances
could be expected.


These thoughts were very much in my mind as
I finished packing for our trip to Chicago and
attended to the small tasks that must be accomplished
before leaving a home unoccupied even
for a few days. In the early afternoon my younger
daughter came home from high school and announced,
"There&apos;s going to be a repeat performance."


She will never know how startled and alarmed
I was by her remark.


As calmly as possible I questioned, "What do
you <i>mean?</i> A <i>repeat</i> performance?"


She replied, "Every little while they announce

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I look back, I fear that my delicate balance
was then and there upset in favor of the dream
world. The final phase had begun. Apparently the
mysterious performance that so long had disturbed
my dreams was about to take place in the
every day world. Perhaps an "inner circle" of
humanity had seized the radio stations and was
broadcasting watchwords and coded messages to
alert the intuitive members of an invisible group
to an approaching event of great significance.


From then on all words spoken in the outer
world played a double role. In addition to their
matter-of-fact surface meaning, they seemed to
refer also to the strange events of my subjective
life. Could it be possible that I entered the dream
world while still retaining a certain amount of
consciousness in, and contact with, the everyday
world? Whatever the situation might be, the experience
eventually turned into a waking nightmare.


With anxiety in my heart I continued my packing
and final arrangements for the trip, hoping
that I would be able to hold myself together
whatever might occur.


Late in the afternoon my daughter and I took a
taxi to the railroad station in order to meet my

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The persons I overheard appeared to be speaking
in such a knowing and meaningful manner
that I wondered if they were getting thoughts
by telepathic means and were tossing the words
about to let me--and each other--know that
something important was about to happen. Had
we reached the end of an old era? Was the closed
book I had seen in my dream soon to be opened?
Were Michaelmas daisies really being harvested?


We arrived in New York, and, despairing of
ever getting a taxi at the rush hour, set out to
walk the four long blocks crosstown from the station
to our apartment. My younger daughter
undertook to carry the heaviest suitcase and
clumsiest shopping bag, but it was still all I could
do in my exhausted, nervous state to manage one
suitcase, pocketbook and a package filled with
gifts.


We stopped every few yards so I could rest and
catch my breath. The crowds were tremendous
that night. Perhaps humanity had been drawn
into the great city from the four corners of the
earth for a special event. The masses and masses

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At last we reached the warmth and refuge of
our apartment. The turmoil in my mind continued.
My husband was already present and our
older daughter arrived shortly.


Because we were flying to Chicago on Christmas
Eve our little family gathered together this
night of the twenty-third to exchange gifts. The
gathering was a distressing one for me. Each gift
when unwrapped, came as a shock, even the
presents I myself had so carefully purchased.
Each had a double meaning--a good interpretation
and a bad interpretation. The shadings of life
were disappearing and everything was becoming
either/or.


Every inanimate thing in the apartment now
took on meaning. For instance, the articles on a
table would tell an elaborate story. Someone
would pick up an item, or change things around,
and I could then read an entirely different message.
Articles seemed to be deliberately placed
and then switched about in order to convey

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My family unknowingly added to my fears.
Their remarks had one meaning to them and another
to me. As these double-meaning sentences
continued I knew without a doubt that all had
roles in this drama but were unconscious of the
fact.


My apprehensions became so intense that I had
to confess to being quite ill. Our older daughter
prepared supper and I soon retired, but there was
little sleep for me.


I couldn&apos;t drive from my mind the memory that
thirteen years previously I had undergone an
awesome experience in the basement of the very
building in which we were now staying. I wondered
if fate had drawn us all back for its own
purpose, a purpose at once terrifying and mysterious.


For the first time that night came a presentiment
that was to plague my mind frequently during
the days that followed. As presaged in my
dreams, I would not have been surprised if I had
heard my name called at any moment. I knew I
should respond immediately, and I worried how I
might do this from my bedroom ten stories above
ground.


Should I open the window and walk out? Or
should I run into the hall and ring for the elevator?

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What if I only <i>thought</i> I had heard my name
called and went out to mingle with the crowds
and nothing happened? Most assuredly people
would think I was mad.


Around my neck I was wearing an Indian elephant
leash made of silver. The clasp simply
would not open. Too nervous to struggle with it, I
left the leash on during an almost sleepless night.
There was something ominous in the fact that I
was unable to remove the necklace. Literally and
figuratively I felt a noose around my neck--a
warning for days to come that one false move
would bring the end of me. And even worse,
whatever the threat, it was menacing my family
as well. Constantly I felt that my family would be
implicated if I failed in any way. I knew I had
tremendous responsibility but I did not know for
what.


After a fashion at least, I was able to hold together
during the flight to Chicago, during
Christmas Eve and even Christmas Day, but the
effort demanded grew increasingly more difficult
to sustain.


I felt intensely that <i>time was running out</i>. I
also intuitively sensed that this trip to Chicago

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Foremost in my mind was the fancy that some
extremely droll minds with much leisure were
amusing themselves composing a ludicrous play.
An unseen performance seemed to be taking
place in the midst of a real but indifferent world.
I sensed that mixed in the masses of people were
some who were playing double roles--acting in
the obscure drama of the spirit as well as in the
tangible one of the body. There seemed no mistaking
that I had been caught up by some curious
fate in an invisible as well as visible performance
in which one moment I felt warmly welcomed,
the next coldly disdained, never knowing from
moment to moment whether my precarious role
should command sympathy or ridicule.


The hours and days in Chicago were a confused
jumble, resembling a ball of twine with a
thousand ends. Yet certain events stood out
clearly. I am able to extract a thread or two with
substance enough to tell how I existed and how I
made naïve efforts to cope with an experience I
could not understand.


My one vivid impression of Christmas Day was
dinner. A reservation for our party of eight had
been made in the main dining room of a fashionable

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The constant expectation that something was
about to happen, which had so far failed to occur,
kept my nerves on edge. Each move I made
seemed to test my patience and endurance. I even
worried that I might make a dreadful mistake in
selecting my dinner. I studied each item on the
menu, ordered with caution and hoped I was fulfilling
correctly my enigmatic role.


When the day ended, and nothing of a world-shaking
nature occurred, I was relieved I had had
sufficient control to keep from proclaiming to my
family my strong conviction that ominous events
were at hand....


Saturday morning, December 26, 1959 was
cold, clear, crisp--a gorgeous day. My husband,
the girls and I walked down Michigan Avenue.
The shop windows were enchanting. Every article
I looked at closely appeared to be made of
precious materials. The beaded decoration on an
evening sweater appeared to my eyes as a motif
carefully worked out in diamonds, rubies and

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As we walked down the Avenue, I pointed out
to my family items that seemed to me beautiful
beyond belief. This was taken in happy faith by
my husband and daughters. The Christmas decorations,
the trees, even a crack in the sidewalk
had meaning for me.


Eventually we entered a restaurant. It was
quite empty but almost immediately became
filled with diners. Such experience, or its reverse,
seemed to happen continually for some time to
come. We would enter an empty restaurant
which would quickly fill up. Or the restaurant
would be so crowded that the possibility of getting
a table would seem hopeless; however, as
soon as we were assigned a table, one by one the
other tables would be deserted until we might be
the only guests left. Such happenings strengthened
my feelings that I was moving contrary to a
normal current, living in an interim state at a
point of change. I was uncertain whether we
were the last stragglers of an old era or perhaps
the earliest arrivals in a new age. Strange things
were going on in my head, but each inner event

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To return to the morning after Christmas, we
agreed, following our walk and late breakfast,
that I was to go back to the hotel and rest while
my husband and the girls shopped and did a bit
of sightseeing. Then I was to join them late in the
afternoon for dinner and an evening at my
mother-in-law&apos;s.


I returned to the hotel but found little rest.
When I attempted to relax the phone would ring
in error or a maid would enter with towels.
Everything conspired to exhaust me.


At some point during that long afternoon the
boundaries of my mind seemed to melt away so
that other minds had clear access to mine. These
minds were able to examine every last thought in
my consciousness but the process could be in one
direction only. I was still limited to my own perceptions.


Now I was more certain than ever before that
these minds wanted to get messages and instructions
to me but could do so only by intuitive or
telepathic means. Surely it could be possible for
minds to exchange thoughts without words or
physical contact.


I had so longed for help and advice that I

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I started to dress for the evening and was impressed
by the remarkable and uncanny foresight
I had shown in packing my suitcase. Each article
of clothing, each accessory, conveyed an astonishing
amount of meaning that had not been in my
mind when I had made the selections. I had come
well prepared and was now almost ready to step
out into the open on my first trial assignment. I
didn&apos;t know what to expect but was rather sure
that when I walked out the door I would be observed
and judged on my ability as a <i>receiver</i>.


I dressed carefully; I didn&apos;t want to make a
mistake. Each detail seemed of utmost importance.
I was undecided whether or not to wear

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When the elevator arrived a woman as well as
an operator were in the cab. Upon entering the
elevator the operator did not immediately close
the door but held it open while he asked (it
seemed to me rather pointedly) if I wanted the
lobby floor or the street level.


I had thought naturally that I would follow
and receive instructions and here, immediately, I
was confronted with a decision. The choice was
so unexpected and seemed so important that I
was afraid to decide. I turned to the woman (I
smile with chagrin when I think of it now) and
asked, "Which would you suggest?"


She looked at me coldly and answered with
what seemed to me carefully chosen words,
words loaded with significance, "It depends on
<i>where</i> you want to go."


I said, "The lobby." But the choice worried me.
The operator began to close the door in what
seemed a reluctant and lingering way. It was almost
shut when I said, "Better take me to the
street level."


As I uttered these words the doors were thrown
back suddenly and a bellboy came running down

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The operator said, "A close call. You nearly
missed it this time." I felt that his words had been
spoken indirectly for my benefit, and now I
sensed an easing of tension and a general air of
relief about me.


The woman also went to the ground floor. I
allowed her to precede me out of the elevator.
She continued on to the revolving street door,
carefully slowing it somewhat with her white-gloved
hand as she gained the street and disappeared.


My training had evidentally begun; I had been
pretty clumsy and slow thinking--and conceited
too. Agents didn&apos;t show off in lobbies. They always
descended to the lowest level, even if they
then had to walk back up a floor or two. And they
never, never <i>showed their hands</i>. I sensed that I
had encountered three experienced workers and
had acted the tyro throughout.


Considerably abashed, I left the safety of the
hotel and entered the throng of passers-by. Instantly
my heightened senses spotted what soon
grew into a mighty army of significantly white-gloved
hands. No doubt there were many secret
agents mingled in the crowd. How audacious of
me to think I was anything special. I was simply

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Suddenly someone was thinking with me. "It&apos;s
not difficult to get as far as you have gone. You&apos;ve
reached the half-way mark."


This thought was another terrific letdown. Was
it possible that <i>all</i> these agents (or half-agents as
they had suddenly become) had struggled as
long and as hard and as dangerously as I had,
only to accomplish nothing unusual?


From the drinker: "That&apos;s right. There is nothing
unusual in getting half-way. The trick is to
get turned about. I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t give you much
advice. However, the belief is often held that
whatever a person has done in order to get halfway
should be repeated, step for step, but in reverse
order."


I stopped dead, horrified, but my mind raced
on. "Do you mean that I have to start now and
live back again in the opposite direction every
single experience and effort of the last thirteen
years?"


I continued walking and pondering. "This is almost
overwhelming. There must be some other
way. But if there isn&apos;t, I&apos;ll have no choice but to
try doing the whole thing over again backwards."


From start to finish I had felt that I was being
continually tested. I had been obliged to balance

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

More odd coincidences, capable of different
interpretations, were in store for me. I reached
the apartment building and took the elevator to
the proper floor. In the hall, however, I turned to
the right instead of to the left. Upon discovering
my mistake, I retraced my steps and rang the bell
to my mother-in-law&apos;s apartment. Her companion
answered the door, ushered me in, and explained
that mother was resting and that I was the first to
arrive. She said that she was happy we could
have a little time <i>alone</i>.


Immediately alerted by the emphasized word,
I wondered, had she purposely stressed the word
"alone?"


I then told her of my mistake when leaving the
elevator.


She gave me what seemed an understanding
look and chatted on, saying that such a mistake
was quite natural. Even she would turn the
wrong way at first, but one soon got used to this.
In fact, everything was just the same, but flopped
over, so to speak.


I recalled that my mother-in-law had for many
years occupied another apartment that was similar

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If I could only sound her out and discover a
next move. We indulged in further small talk, and
I mentioned that I had not been feeling well.


This trifling remark seemed to alarm her. When
she learned that I had eaten nothing since breakfast,
she insisted on preparing a snack for me. She
stressed the importance of keeping up my
strength.


The snack turned out to be an enormous ham
sandwich and a tall glass of milk. I was somewhat
appalled at the generous serving, but when she
insisted that food would be good for me I ate it
all. In my perilous condition I couldn&apos;t afford to
reject any aid that might be extended to me.


No sooner had I finished the food when my
husband, the girls and other relatives arrived.
Shortly after we all were assembled, a very fine

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, the people on <i>this side</i> were kind and
considerate. My husband said he would give me a
serving I could eat, and he placed a scant teaspoonful
of each of the different foods on a plate
for me. The sampling was so dainty that I was
able to dispose of it.


I sat thinking that I could accept the joke
about the ham sandwich, no doubt I deserved it;
but my hopes of help from this woman faded.
Even if she had spent years in half-way land I
doubted that she knew much more than I did. I
would still have to rely on myself. For better or
worse I was on my own.


After dinner there was music on the radio, so
gay that several of us began dancing. My older
daughter, thinking to bring me into the merry
group, pulled me to my feet and whirled me
around. No sooner had we taken a few steps than
the music changed its tune and broke into "It
Had To Be You, Nobody But You," and a disagreeable
voice blared the message so importunately
and with such teasing innuendos that I
knew it was meant for me.

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Again I felt I was being mocked, ridiculed for
thinking myself anything special. Could the
powers that be even use the radio when they
wished to speak to me? Had they used my mother-in-law&apos;s
companion as an unconscious transmitter
through which to play a mean little joke on me?


I managed to sit through the rest of the evening,
but my inner turmoil was great. Each article
in the room was coming alive and conveying messages.
There were several interpretations possible
for each innocent remark anyone made. I felt
more and more like an utterly helpless radio with
any number of stations tuned in at once and without
control. It was as though someone were constantly
switching stations, running two or three
programs simultaneously, turning them up unbearably
loud. Thoughts were occurring to me so
fast they blended together. My receiving set just
couldn&apos;t keep up. Bedlam took over and the unseen
performance in which I seemed to have a
part rapidly turned into a dreadful play--just as a
recent dream had foretold.


Worse, I felt that all the coincidences and unpleasant
jests had been used as tests to see how
much I could endure. Now I sensed that a conference
was held and a decision reached: "She
can take it. We&apos;ll go ahead and give her the
works."

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At this writing I still can&apos;t understand why
messages and thoughts frequently came to me in
slangy and slovenly language, language I particularly
disliked. So often the ideas would turn into
jingles, puns, or a play on words. All this was
often singsongy and tinpanny like a television or
radio commercial.


On this Saturday evening my mind finally became
so crowded with tumult that I could remember
nothing. I don&apos;t even recall how we got
back to the hotel. But I do know that beginning
with this night I was a very sick woman and no
longer able to disguise the fact. I simply could
not hold together any longer. For still another
time in my life I had to let go.
