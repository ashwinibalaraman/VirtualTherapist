Cancer is a commonly dreaded disease
that is the second leading cause of
death in the Western world. The
incidence of cancer, especially of specific
diagnoses (e.g., breast, melanoma, thyroid,
esophagus, liver), has increased during recent
years, even when improvements in diagnosis
and age-related trends are considered (SEER
Program, 2002). If current trends continue,
cancer diagnoses are expected to double
over the next 50 years (Hoyert, Kochanek, &amp;
Murphy, 1999), with more than 1.3 million
new cases of cancer diagnosed annually in
the United States alone (Garfinkel, 1995).


Cancer denotes a family of diagnoses that
may affect different body sites, including the
breasts, prostate, lungs, brain, gastrointestinal
organs, skin, soft tissues, and blood. It mostly
consists of a tumor in a specific site but may
spread to other sites (i.e., metastases), and this
is one of the reasons why it is commonly considered
as a systemic disease. Based on the size
of the primary lesion and the spread of the
disease at diagnosis, different stages (mostly
four with subdivisions) are identified, reflecting
increasing severity. In distinction from staging,
tumor grading indicates the similarity of the
tumor cells to their normal tissue counterparts
(based primarily on the degree of differentiation
of the malignant cells and secondarily on an
estimate of their growth rate). The major treatment
modalities are surgery, radiation therapy,
chemotherapy, immunomodulation, and bone
marrow transplantation. Treatment may last
for months and may need to be administered
repeatedly. Following the initial diagnosis of the
disease and its treatment, remission may set in
for differential periods of time. The disease-free
interval ends if the disease recurs. Recurrence
usually denotes a deterioration but not necessarily
death.


Cancer affects individuals of both genders
and of all ages and ethnic backgrounds, albeit
to different degrees, so that specific cancers
may be more prevalent in individuals of a particular
gender, ethnic background, geographical
area, or age group. The pathogen of cancer
has not been identified, although several risk
factors are known, ranging from genetic back-ground
to more behavioral factors such as
smoking, exposure to the sun, contact with
particular carcinogens, and diets that may
increase the incidence of particular cancers
(Garfinkel, 1995).


Psycho-oncology is the discipline of health
psychology that deals with the psychological
aspects of cancer. It is often considered as one
of the most comprehensively studied domains

[p. <i>326</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00336&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<b>Overview of Special Crises and Problems</b>

It is of special importance to identify the
crisis situations and problems characteristic
of cancer patients. These form special foci for
intervention and research.


<b>
<i>Prevention</i>
</b>


Despite knowledge that early diagnosis
and treatment of most cancer types facilitates
treatment and enhances survival rates, many
individuals do not undergo the medically
recommended periodical tests for the early
detection of cancer and might even overlook
early symptoms if these occur. This is mostly
due not to lack of information on the part of
patients or physicians but rather to psychological
factors, such as excessive fear of cancer,
that may even reach the level of the psychiatrically
meaningful syndrome of cancerophobia
(Ingelfinger, 1975), a false sense of physical
security grounded in characteristic attitudes
and beliefs, entrenched coping styles of passivity
and denial, and preexisting emotional difficulties
(Green, Rimer, &amp; Elwood, 1981). As a result,
cancer is often diagnosed in a later stage than
would have been possible and beneficial for the
patient. The delayed diagnosis not only may
result in a compromising prognosis but also
may have two significant psychological
sequelae: sense of guilt and loss of the sense of
physical security and confidence (Kreitler,
Chaitchik, &amp; Kreitler, 1990). The former
reflects thoughts such as the following: "In retrospect,
I can see that if I had paid more attention
to myself, I could have avoided the
catastrophe." The latter reflects thoughts such as
the following: "How come I did not know for so
long that something is wrong with my body?"
and "How could I be sure now that I am not
terribly sick, although I feel nothing is wrong?"


<b>
<i>Diagnosis</i>
</b>


Because of the alarming connotations of
cancer, the diagnosis of cancer often has a
shocking effect on the patient. Even the mere
initiation of a series of tests in response to the
patient's complaints may evoke increased anxiety
and a sense of life being set "on hold" until
the tests are concluded. If the diagnosis of
cancer arrives, the shock may be so great that
even the risk of suicide cannot be ruled out
(Campbell, 1996). This state of increased stress
and panic is usually resolved partly through
denial and mainly through speeded-up transfer
to the stage of treatments in which both the
patient and the physician are interested.


<b>
<i>Decision Making</i>
</b>


Following diagnosis, the patient is often
called on to participate in the decisions
about the kind of treatment (surgery, kind of
surgery, chemotherapy, specific protocol of
chemotherapy, radiation, and complementary/alternative
treatment, each singly or in

[p. <i>327</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00337&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>
<i>Undergoing Treatments</i>
</b>


Treatments in oncology are both difficult
and mostly protracted. They often
include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.
Surgery may be undertaken for different
purposes: diagnostic (i.e., biopsy), therapeutic
(i.e., removal of tumor or metastases), reconstructive
(e.g., esophagus, bladder, breast), or
palliative (e.g., biliary or urethral diversions,
pleurodesis or analgesic such as cordotomy).
Surgery is often accompanied by intense anxiety,
especially if it is diagnostic or results in
bodily changes such as stoma, loss of an organ
(e.g., breast, limb), loss of a function (e.g.,
talking, walking), or visible disfigurement
(e.g., face, neck). Changes of this kind are
often accompanied by changes in body image
that reflect on the patient's sense of self-esteem
and self-identity (Rapoport, Kreitler,
Chaitchik, Algor, &amp; Weissler, 1993; Sneeuw,
Aaronson, &amp; Yarnold, 1992).


Chemotherapy may be administered as a
major therapeutic agent for controlling the
disease and promoting remission, as adjuvant
treatment subsequent to surgery for eradicating
presumptive micrometastases, or as neoadjuvant
treatment for reducing the tumor prior
to surgery. Chemotherapy mostly consists of
a combination of drugs that are administered
through infusion (or sometimes tablets), in the
hospital or clinic (or sometimes at home),
according to a certain regimen (e.g., once every
2 or 3 weeks) over months. Chemotherapy
may adversely affect the patient's quality of life
(QOL). The most salient effects are due to the
toxicity of the drugs themselves. Some of these
effects are neuropsychological, including
dementia, delirium, lethargy, depression, and
even psychosis that may be evoked by prednisone
as well as delirium following the use of
vincristine or cisplatin. In addition, the drugs
may cause nausea and vomiting, alopecia (e.g.,
adriamycin), weight changes (gain or loss),
insomnia, gonadal dysfunction, difficulties
with concentration and short-term memory,
and disorders of fertility and sexuality. The
short-term effects are mostly stronger following
the administration of the drugs and get
weaker after a few days. The side effects
together with the generalized weakness and
fatigue disrupt the patient's daily routine
and render it difficult for the patient to keep
up work or carry out planned commitments
(Clark &amp; Fallowfield, 1986).


Radiation may be undertaken as a major
therapeutic agent, as an adjunct to chemotherapy
designed to minimize the chance of recurrence,
or for palliative and analgesic purposes.
It is often of shorter duration than chemotherapy
but may also be accompanied by side
effects (e.g., nausea, fatigue, or anorexia,
depending on the site, dose, and volume of
treatment).


Other frequent treatments include immunotherapy
(e.g., interferon), with side effects

[p. <i>328</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00338&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the course of treatments, the patient is
highly vulnerable and needs a lot of support
and encouragement to overcome the difficulties.
However, getting treatment makes the
patient feel that there is hope for recovery,
thereby contributing to improving the patient's
QOL (Kovner &amp; Kreitler, 1996).


<b>
<i>Being a Chronic Cancer
Patient in Remission</i>
</b>


Although remission is a positive state from
the medical point of view, it is not necessarily
so psychologically. During the first stage of
remission, patients may feel anxious because
of the need to learn to function on their own
and handle different bodily reactions without
the continuous contact with the medical staff
that characterized the phase of treatments.
Furthermore, patients who have completed a
protracted series of treatments start to reconsider
whether their lives are satisfying and
meaningful enough, especially in view of the
suffering they incurred during treatment. In
view of the close encounter with death that
patients have undergone, they may also experience
the pressure to use advantageously the
time they have gained by enjoying themselves
or doing things they consider relevant and
important for themselves. Moreover, anxiety
about the possible recurrence of the disease
persists. It may be further enhanced by regular
follow-up visits to their doctors and is often
also maintained by continuous medical treatments
(e.g., tamoxifen tablets in breast cancer
patients). In addition, patients may feel the
need, to normalize their interpersonal relations
after a period characterized by getting help
and social support from relatives and friends.
For this reason, as well as because of their
desire to reestablish their daily routines,
patients may minimize their references to the
disease and put on a cheerful mask of "business
as usual." This may enhance their isolation
and speed up the process of patients'
"burnout" (Kreitler &amp; Chaitchik, 1993).


<b>
<i>Disease Recurrence
and Deterioration</i>
</b>


Disease recurrence is a particularly difficult
phase for patients because it represents a shattering
of their hopes for complete recovery or
at least ensured survival. It also indicates the
necessity to undergo a series of treatments,
some of which may be more difficult than those
during the initial phase. The situation may be
exacerbated, through the appearance of different
physical symptoms signaling deterioration.
As a result, patients may find it difficult to
avoid thinking about death as a real possibility.
Hence, fear of death is a theme that occurs with
increasing intensity during this phase.


<b>
<i>Terminal Stage</i>
</b>


Physical symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue,
motor disabilities) as well as psychological
symptoms (e.g., disorientation, depression)
may turn this phase into a particularly difficult
one for patients and their families. One
impending problem is the need to decide
whether to continue medical treatments, given
that their contribution to prolonging life may
be small and uncertain and their effect on QOL
is negative, or whether to stop treatments altogether
and enjoy a certain modicum of QOL
that may still be possible. Thus, during this
phase, some patients may be getting curative
treatments, whereas others may be getting only
palliative treatments or none at all. This phase
is characteristically marked by the phases of
dying, that is, gradual withdrawal from different
preoccupations and interests (e.g., work,
profession, friends, entertainment) that may be
accompanied by gradual physical weakening.

[p. <i>329</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00339&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During recent years, the issues of "physician-assisted
suicide" and "right to die" have been
increasingly discussed in regard to the terminal
stage. On the basis of questionnaire surveys,
it seems that about 8% to 25% of oncology
patients with advanced disease express interest
in death alternatives (Chochinov et al., 1995;
Emanuel, Fairclough, Daniels, &amp; Clarridge,
1996), citing mostly reasons such as fear of
becoming a burden on their families or of
losing dignity, lack of social support (Back,
Wallace, Starks, &amp; Pearlman, 1996), disease
status, pain, and other bothersome physical
symptoms (Massie, Gagnon, &amp; Holland,
1994). In general, the desire for hastened death
is more a function of psychological and psychiatric
factors, such as depression, than of pain
and. physical problems (Cherny, 1996).


The desire for hastened death is an issue
that deserves consideration apart from the
operational implication of aiding the patient
to die. The desire is unstable (Chochinov,
Tataryn, Clinch, &amp; Dudgeon, 1999), it
increases when the patient is lonely and
depressed (Rosenfeld, 2000), it decreases after
the patient gets social support and exposure to
empathic listening (Severson, 1997), and it is
not a function of current pain (Emanuel et al.,
1996; Sullivan, Rapp, Fitzgibbon, &amp;
Chapman, 1997). It is likely that considering
the option of euthanasia expresses the
patient's need to gain a modicum of control in
a situation marked by extreme helplessness.
These observations suggest that the desire for
hastened death may be a cry for help when
basic psychological and physical needs are
unmet. Taking care of these needs may well
result in a significant decrease in the patient's
interest in assisted suicide.

<b>Brief Overview of Research in the Area</b>

As noted earlier, psycho-oncology has stimulated
much research. This section presents
the major domains of research in psycho-oncology.
Each subsection includes a brief
description of issues and major findings.


<i>
<b>Cancer Prevention and Screening</b>
</i>


A typical assumption is that at least a third
of the cases of cancer could be prevented
by controlling behaviors such as smoking,
drinking alcohol, prolonged, exposure to the
sun, and contact with carcinogens. Another
assumption is that undergoing regular tests in
adherence with the screening regulations for
the various cancers (e.g., annual PSA test for
men over age 50 years, repeated self-examination
of the skin for melanoma or of the breasts
for suspicious lumps) could have further
reduced the lethality of the disease. Despite
increased efforts at information dissemination,
prevention and screening have not reached, the
desirable levels. For example, although the
contribution of smoking to cancers of all kinds
has been established and is well known, only
about half of the smokers have quit smoking,
and very low percentages persist in not smoking
for longer durations (for 1 year, 1% to 5%
of smokers after treatment or self-quitters
[Cinciripini, 1995]). The same is true for
screening. In regard to breast screening, only
about 15% to 30% of women get screened,
and even individuals at risk do not comply as

[p. <i>330</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00340&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A great number of studies have been done
to understand the causes of noncompliance
and to increase compliance in these areas (e.g.,
Cinciripini, 1995; DiPlacido, Zauber, &amp; Redd,
1998; Rossi, Blais, Redding, &amp; Weinstock,
1995). Studies have shown that information
about risks, benefits, and dangers of doing or
avoiding certain behaviors do not suffice for
motivating people to comply with the medical
recommendations. The health beliefs model
assumes that four components play a significant
role in screening behavior: beliefs about a
person's susceptibility to the disease, beliefs
about the severity of the disease, beliefs about
the barriers and difficulties of the behavior,
and beliefs about the benefits of the behavior
(Janz &amp; Becker, 1984). However, these variables
often have proved insufficient for predicting
or generating the desired, behavior and
had to be supplemented by various circumstantial
factors (e.g., Janz &amp; Becker, 1984;
Murray &amp; McMillan, 1993). Some studies
suggest that noncompliance with screening
may have deeper dynamic roots. First, because
higher perceived risk among women with a
family history of breast cancer reduces frequency
of mammography screening (Polednak,
Lane, &amp; Burg, 1991), it is likely that increased
fear may deter women from undergoing tests.
Accordingly, reducing the anxiety by framing
the medical test in a nonthreatening setup
increased attendance (Chaitchik &amp; Kreitler,
1991). Second, women of a specific personality
type (e.g., higher on negative emotions, with a
restricted self-concept) were found to be more
likely than other women to undergo screening
tests (Kreitler et al., 1990). Findings of this
kind, suggest that screening may resemble other
behaviors in being controlled by motivational
dispositions, for example, in line with the cognitive
orientation theory (Kreitler &amp; Kreitler,
1982). This theory assumes that behavior is
guided by motivational vectors defined by four
types of beliefs (about oneself, reality, norms,
and goals) reflecting dynamically meaningful
themes rather than by conscious, voluntary,
rational decisions reflecting cost-benefit considerations.
Identifying the motivationally relevant
beliefs enabled the successful prediction of
who would undergo screening for breast,
colorectal, and cervical cancers (Kreitler, 1998).
The prediction for breast cancer held in regard.
to different populations (e.g., urban, workplace)
and different kinds of screening (e.g.,
induced, spontaneous, personal initiative or
not, examination by self or doctor), whereby
the best results were obtained with repeated,
self-initiated screening by a doctor (Kreitler,
Chaitchik, Kreitler, &amp; Weissler, 1994).


<i>
<b>Coping and Adaptation</b>
</i>


Coping is the general concept that
describes strategies for dealing with threat.
Strategies of coping are triggered whenever
there is a large gap between the extent of the
resources appraised by an individual as necessary
for handling a situation and the extent
of resources appraised as available to the
individual (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984).
Coping is evoked when the gap in appraised.
resources is indeed large but less than in the
case of despair, often characterized as hopelessness/
helplessness, and more than in the
case of mere challenge, often experienced as
"I could handle it if I tried hard enough." A
large variety of coping mechanisms have

[p. <i>331</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00341&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There have been numerous attempts to
identify the efficacy of coping mechanisms,
whereby efficacy is defined in terms of
improving the patient's adjustment and QOL.
Most prior research suggests that there is no
one specific coping mechanism that can be
considered as the best because the efficacy of a
strategy depends on (a) the individual (e.g.,
one patient may find comfort through faith
and religion, another through emotional support,
and. another through going back to work
[e.g., Schonfield, 1972]) and (b) the stage of
the disease and the problems confronting the
individual. Thus, the individual changes in
the use of different coping mechanisms in the
course of different stages of coping with the
disease (Buddeberg et al., 1996; Heim,
Augustini, Schaffner, &amp; Valach, 1993). In
general, the more efficacious coping mechanisms
are those focused on solving problems,
confronting real-life issues, actively searching
for information (Felton &amp; Revenson, 1984;
Weisman &amp; Worden, 1976-1977), having
emotional discharge (e.g., through humor,
through sharing experiences [Penman, 1980]),
and cultivating hope and optimism (Scheier &amp;
Carver, 2001). The least effective coping
mechanisms are those focused on avoidance,
passivity, pessimism, yielding, blaming, acting
out, apathy, and regrets about the past
(O'Malley, Koocher, Foster, &amp; Slavin, 1979).
Concerning the often-discussed mechanism of
denial, the most adequate conclusion is that it
may be very helpful during specific stages of
coping, especially when applied selectively
(e.g., to emotions and not to reality appraisal)
(Kreitler, 1999). However, it seems warranted
to assume that the quantity and variety of coping
mechanisms that a person has at his or
her disposal constitute a better guarantee for
adjustment than does a specific coping mechanism,
regardless of how efficacious it may be.


Some studies have investigated the efficacy
of coping mechanisms in regard to the course of
disease. Efficacy can be assessed in terms of the
patient's adjustment. For the most part, results
show that low adjustment is significantly
related to recurrence (Rogentine et al., 1979)
and. that better adaptation 1 year after diagnosis
is significantly related to fewer recurrences
after 3 years and to longer survival in 5- and
7-year follow-ups (Kreitler, Kreitler, Chaitchik,
Shaked, &amp; Shaked, 1997). Only one study
found that adjustment was unrelated to recurrence
(Temoshok &amp; Fox, 1984). However,
studies of specific coping mechanisms did not
yield clear results about the benefit of any specific
coping mechanism in regard to survival.
Thus, active behavioral coping was related to
survival (Fawzy, Fawzy, &amp; Canada, 2001), but
the active means of distraction and problem
tacking were unrelated to survival (Buddeberg
et al., 1996). Again, hopelessness/helplessness
was related to recurrence (Jensen, 1987) but
also was unrelated to recurrence and survival
(Cassileth, Lusk, Miller, Brown, &amp; Miller,
1985; Cody et al., 1994; Ringdall, 1995). One
reason for the lack of clarity of the findings is
that in some studies basic medical prognostic
criteria, such as the number of affected lymph
nodes, were not considered. This was the case
in the famous series of the Royal Mardsen studies,
which reported that fighting spirit and perhaps
denial had a positive effect on survival,
whereas stoic acceptance, anxious preoccupation,
and. hopelessness/helplessness had a negative
effect (Greer, Morris, &amp; Pettingale, 1979;

[p. <i>332</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00342&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>
<b>Quality of Life</b>
</i>


Quality of life is defined as the subjective
evaluation by the individual of his or her own
well-being and functioning in different
domains of life. The major characteristics
of QOL are that it is subjective (hence, it is
assessed by self-reports), based on evaluation,
phenomenological (causes not considered),
dynamic (changes in line with changes in situations
and conditions), and multidimensional
(refers to various domains such as physical
functioning, eating, sleeping, sex, emotional
state, cognitive functioning, family life, social
relations, meaning, and coherence in life).
QOL differs from functional indexes that
assess mainly functioning or ability of the individual
to take care of himself or herself in
daily life (e.g., Karnofsky's Performance
Status Rating). QOL assessments mostly fail
to distinguish among groups with different
clinical disease statuses or different levels
of performance ratings (e.g., Aaronson,
Ahmedzai, Bergman, Bullinger, &amp; Cull, 1993;
McHorney, Ware, &amp; Raczek, 1993) but are
sensitive to effects in different domains of life,
for example, in the course of treatments (Ganz
&amp; Coscarelli, 1995). The assessment of QOL
plays an important role in clinical trials, in
decisions about treatments, and in evaluating
the costs of treatments in terms of QOL as
compared with their contribution to survival
(de Haes et al., 2000). One important finding
is that QOL tends to maintain a stable optimal
level based on the appraised status in the
major domains of health, work, and family or
social ties. If status in any of these domains is
lowered for a longer duration, attempts are
made to reinstate the optimal level as much as
possible by establishing the new QOL level on
improvements and increases in a variety of
other domains such as entertainment, dwelling
conditions, and meaningfulness of occupation
(Kreitler, Chaitchik, Rapoport, Kreitler, &amp;
Algor, 1993). This homeostatically grounded
tendency is probably also responsible for the
increases in levels of QOL (even over the pre-disease
levels) that are sometimes observed in
cancer patients who find new venues for creativity
and personal growth.


<i>
<b>Effect of Psychological<br />
Factors on Disease Incidence</b>
</i>


The major psychological factors investigated,
are stressful life events, psychopathology,
and personality tendencies. This subsection
focuses on each in turn. Table 17.1 presents
the basic research designs in this domain.


<i>Stress</i>. Animal models show that stress hastens
the onset and further growth of most
virally induced tumors and inhibits the onset
and growth of nonviral ones (Justice, 1985).
But the results of studies investigating the relations
of stressful life events and cancer incidence
in humans are equivocal. Thus,
case-controlled studies have shown that cancer
patients, as compared with controls,
had more stressful events in their earlier
lives (Courtney, Longnecker, Theorell, &amp;
Gerhardsson de Verdier, 1993; Geyer, 1991),
had the same number of stressful events
(Edwards et al., 1990), or had fewer stressful
events (Priestman, Priestman, &amp; Bradshaw,
1985). Large-cohort studies have yielded similar
results; no relation was found between
stressful events earlier in life and cancer morbidity
in prisoners of war (Joffres, Reed, &amp;
Nomura, 1985; Keehn, 1980; Keehn,
Goldberg, &amp; Beebe, 1974) or between stressful
events earlier in life and bereaved spouses
(Helsing, Comstock, &amp; Szklo, 1982; Kaprio,
Koskenvuo, &amp; Rita, 1987), but more cancer

[p. <i>333</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00343&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I028&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<i>Psychopathology</i>. Earlier studies suggested
that schizophrenics tended to get
cancer less often than did others. Yet later
analyses of the findings showed that the early
studies had led to erroneous conclusions
because they were based on calculating proportional
mortality from cancer instead of
absolute mortality rates (Fox, 1978). Studies
based on absolute rates show that schizophrenics
do not have a reduced rate of cancer
(Gulbinat et al., 1992) and that patients
diagnosed with reactive psychosis may even
have a slightly increased rate of cancer as
compared, with the general population
(jørgensen &amp; Mortensen, 1992).


Depression is another pathological condition
that has been associated with cancer,
especially on the evidence of a cohort
study at an electric plant in Chicago (Persky,
Kempthorne-Rawson &amp; Shekelle, 1987;
Shekelle, Raynor, Ostfeld, &amp; Garron, 1981).
Yet other cohort studies did not confirm this
finding. The combined evidence supported
merely a null or weak relationship between
depression and risk for cancer (Fox, 1989).


<i>Personality</i>. It has been often claimed that a
certain pattern of personality characteristics,
Type C, presents a risk for cancer. Type C has
been described as compliant, unassertive, submissive,
and avoiding the expression of negative
emotions, especially of anger (Temoshok,
1987). Studies have supported some Type C
tendencies. For example, one study enabled significant
identification of cervix cancer patients,
as compared with controls, on the basis of high

[p. <i>334</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00344&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>
<b>Effect of Psychological
Factors on Disease
Course and Survival</b>
</i>


The main investigated factors were stress,
psychopathology, and personality (see also
Table 17.1).


<i>Stress</i>. There is no definitive evidence that
stress influences the course of cancer or survival
rates. For example, no relationship was
found between stressful events and breast
cancer survival (Barraclough et al., 1992).
However, bereavement (losing a son in a war
or in a traffic accident) increased the risk of
death from different types of cancer, but only
if the cancer had been diagnosed before the
loss (and not after it) (Levav et al., 2000).


<i>Psychopathology</i>. To date, the evidence
concerning the effect of depression is equivocal.
One early study indicated higher rates of
depression and psychiatric disorders in patients
with shorter survival periods (Weisman &amp;
Worden, 1975). Another study showed the
reverse; long-term survivors were in greater
distress, whereas short-term survivors
were well adjusted (Derogatis, Abeloff, &amp;
Melisaratos, 1979). Still other studies indicated
that recurrence and survival in cancer patients
are not related to distress (as assessed by the
Symptom Checklist-90) (Holland et al. 1986)
or to anxiety, depression, and anger (Jamison,
Burish, &amp; Wallston, 1987). Indeed, the recent
replication of the Royal Mardsen studies
showed that depression was the only psychological
variable that predicted earlier mortality
from cancer, but there were too few cases to
make the finding reliable (Watson et al., 1999).


<i>Personality</i>. Of the Type C components,
defensiveness was related to shorter survival
(Ratcliffe, Dawson, &amp; Walker, 1995) as well
as to a particular personality type whose major
characteristics are dealing with loss by despair
and retaining closeness to people with whom
one's relationship has ended (Grossarth-Maticek,
Kanazir, Schmidt, &amp; Vetter, 1985).
However, the latter study was severely criticized
in regard to reliability (Schueler &amp; Fox,
1991; Van der Ploeg, 1991). Concerning emotional
suppression, the findings are unclear;
Fox (1998b) found three studies with positive
results, three with negative results, and three

[p. <i>335</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00345&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The cognitive orientation theory has
enabled identifying a set of characteristics
(e.g., readiness to expose a person's
weaknesses, self-confidence, low seeking of
approval, low obsessiveness and compulsiveness)
that differentiated significantly between
patients with recurrence and those without
recurrence at 3 years follow-up and survival
at 5 years onward. During the initial years,
psychological factors contributed less to predicting
survival than did medical factors, but
the former's relative and absolute impacts
increased with time (Kreitler et al., 1997).


In conclusion, there are two main reasons
why most of the findings examining the impact
of psychological factors on survival have been
unclear. One is disregard for the fact that prognosis
of survival should consider conjointedly
medical and psychological factors. The second
is the tendency to narrow research down to a
specific set of psychological variables rather
than to expand the search for new psychological
variables by applying new methodologies.


<i>
<b>Social Relations and Support</b>
</i>


It has long been surmised that the social
environment in which people function affects
cancer incidence and prognosis. The question
of whether social ties affect cancer incidence
has been studied by examining two aspects of
social relations: static-descriptive aspects (i.e.,
marital status and number of social ties) and
active-functional aspects (i.e., extent of participation
and involvement in social relations). In
regard to cancer incidence, various studies
found that married people had a lower incidence
of cancer (Reynolds &amp; Kaplan, 1990),
that they had a higher incidence of cancer
(Zonderman, Costa &amp; McCrae, 1989), and
that the findings probably varied with cancer
site, gender, and ethnicity (e.g., Swanson, Belle,
&amp; Satariano, 1985). No effect of marriage on
recurrence was found (Burman &amp; Margolin,
1992). In regard to survival, studies showed a
small effect of better survival for married,
women (Goodwin, Hunt, Key, &amp; Samet,
1987), but only when they are young (Neale,
Tilley, &amp; Vernon, 1986) and not for older
women (Cassileth, Walsh, &amp; Lusk, 1988).
However, there is also evidence of shorter survival
for married women (Ell, Nishimoto,
Mediansky, Mantell, &amp; Hamovitch, 1992)
and of no relation between survival and being
married (e.g., Dean &amp; Surtees, 1989). The
results are inconsistent, possibly because cancer
site, gender, and quality of marriage have
not been considered.


In regard to size of social network, studies
show no relation to incidence (Reynolds &amp;
Kaplan, 1990), recurrence (Cassileth et al.,
1985), or survival (Vogt, Mullooly, Ernst,
Pope, &amp; Hollis, 1992). In contrast, active social
participation and active involvement have a
positive effect on reduced recurrence (Hislop,
Waxier, Coldman, Elwood, &amp; Kan, 1987) and
on longer survival (Vogt et al., 1992), more so
with friends than with relatives (Waxier-Morrison,
Hislop, Mears, &amp; Kan, 1991).


Cancer patients often refer to their need for
emotional support, which is widely believed,
to positively affect the course of disease. In one
study, perceived family support did not predict
recurrence (Levy, Herberman, Lippman,
D'Angelo, &amp; Lee, 1991). However, shorter survival
was related to feeling isolated and lonely
(only in women) and to having few contacts (in
men) (Reynolds &amp; Kaplan, 1990) as well as to
having a high need for emotional support
(Stavraky, Donner, Kincade, &amp; Stewart, 1988),
whereas longer survival was related to perceived
adequacy of family support (Stavraky
et al., 1988) and to getting adequate emotional
support (only in women) (Ell et al., 1992). It is
likely that social participation positively affects
survival and disease progression because it hastens
diagnosis (Neale et al., 1986) and promotes
compliance with treatment (Richardson,
Shelton, Krailo, &amp; Levine, 1990).

[p. <i>336</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00346&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />


There are often cited studies that supposedly
support the effects of social support interventions
on survival. The best known is the
Stanford University study that claimed an
additional 18 months of life for advanced
breast cancer patients who got social support
as compared with controls (Spiegel et al.,
1999). However, the study was criticized for
methodological reasons, mainly sample choice
and differences between the two groups (Fox,
1998 a; Kogon, Biswas, Pearl, Carlson, &amp;
Spiegel, 1997) and failed to be replicated.
(Goodwin et al., 2001; Spiegel et al., 1999).
Methodological criticism was also leveled
against other studies in regard to the effects of
social support (Gellert, Maxwell, &amp; Siegel,
1993; Morgenstern, Gellert, Walter, Ostfeld,
&amp; Siegel, 1984). In contrast, many studies
show clearly the beneficial effect of social support
on patients' QOL (e.g., Bloom, 1986;
Dunkel-Schetter, 1984; Spiegel et al., 1999).


Future research in social support could
benefit from considering the following: (a) the
differential effects of various types of social
support (e.g., informational, emotional), (b) the
source of support (e.g., relatives, health professionals),
and (c) the dependence of the need for
support on personality and availability
(Dunkel-Schetter, 1984).


<i>
<b>Family</b>
</i>


The family is involved in psycho-oncology
in different aspects. First, the family is a
provider of care for the patient (e.g., providing
emotional support, getting information,
offering help in decision making, giving concrete
help, sharing financial costs, meeting
social needs and costs, maintaining routine)
(Lederberg, 1998). Second, the family undergoes
serious changes due to the patient's disease
and the involved stresses (e.g., changes in
routines, roles, attachment relationships, manner
of functioning, structure, and sense of wellbeing)
(Weihs &amp; Reiss, 1995). Third, specific
family members may be exposed to special
stresses (e.g., children of sick parents, parents
of sick children regardless of the children's
ages, partners of patients) (Keller, Henrich,
Sellschopp, &amp; Beutel, 1995; Koch, Härter,
Jakob, &amp; Siegrist, 1995). Fourth, the family is
exposed to severe stresses due to the patient's
sickness and everything else it involves, including
the changes in daily routine and roles, the
threat of impending death, and/or conflicts
with the medical staff (Jacobs, Ostroff, &amp;
Steinglass, 1998). Families vary greatly in the
manner in which they cope with the difficulties
and respond to the stresses. Some mobilize
resources and are even strengthened, whereas
others disintegrate. Some families provide
support or solve problems, whereas others are
hostile or withdrawn (Kissane, Block,
McKenzie, McDowall, &amp; Nitzan, 1998). The
state of the family is an important factor in
the patient's well-being, not least because the
family is a serious provider of care to the
patient. The family's coping depends on several
factors such as how it interprets external
reality and defines its identity (Jacobs et al.,
1998) as well as the degrees of communication,
emotional expressiveness, and cohesion in the
family (Kissane et al., 1998). There is a growing
awareness in health professional circles
that family members deserve special psychological
support so that they can withstand adequately
the hard and prolonged stresses of
cancer, provide the patient with an adequate
environment, and avoid turning into "second-order
patients" (Jacobs et al., 1998).


<i>
<b>Getting Information
and Truth Telling</b>
</i>


Information about diagnosis, prognosis,
and treatment is one of the most central issues
for the cancer patient. Its importance has been
enhanced by the tendency during past generations
to keep the diagnosis secret and by the
current tendency to involve the patient in decisions
about treatments. Information is a
theme that occurs primarily during the first

[p. <i>337</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00347&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Studies show that patients often view the
amount of information they got from their
doctors as less than the amount the doctors
estimate they have transmitted (Chaitchik,
Kreitler, Schwartz, Shaked, &amp; Rosin, 1992).
There is also a difference in the kind of information
expected and that obtained. Patients
often expect to get information about whether
their doctors believe the treatment will help
them, what their real states are, whether they
are about to die, and how long they have to
live. In contrast, the information they get refers
to diagnosis, stage, grade, and percentages of
remission following different treatments.
Hence, patients are often frustrated. Another
complicating factor is the conflict that many
patients experience among the kind of information
they want to get (e.g., good news),
the kind they think they should get (e.g., how
long they have to live), and the kind they
get (e.g., facts about diagnosis and prognosis).
Moreover, patients may be reluctant to ask for
information they want or think they are entitled
to get because they believe that their doctors
know best what is good for them, so that
if the doctors did not provide that information,
it is probably not good for the patients to have
it (Chaitchik et al., 1992; Kreitler, Chaitchik,
Kovner, &amp; Kreitler, 1992).


After getting the relevant information, the
major issue becomes living with the information.
For example, a study with head and neck
patients showed that those who had a large
amount of information had improved relations
with family members and friends but
functioned, less well at work and suffered from
anxiety about their medical state, those who
had a little information had tense and poorer
relations with family members and friends but
functioned well at work and did not suffer
from undue anxiety, and those who had a
medium amount of information had tense
relations with others as well as problems with
work and anxiety (Kreitler et al., 1995).


Another aspect of information in cancer
patients concerns the communication of information
by the patient to others. Patients are
often concerned with issues such as how much
and which information about their states
of health to disclose, to whom, and when.
Considerations include not wanting to bother
others or to burden them emotionally, preserving
patients' self-esteem, avoiding the pity
of others, and maintaining patients' denial of
the disease. Notably, one study showed that
even spouses of cancer patients know relatively
little about what cancer patients experience
and know, indicating a low degree of
communication (Chaitchik et al., 1992).

<i>
<b>Genetic Testing and Counseling</b>
</i>


The spectacular advances of genetic
research have increased the importance of
three categories of genetic determinants
related to cancer: (a) cytogenetics, which concerns
abnormal chromosomes; (b) single-gene
traits, which concern hereditary mutations
(e.g., <i>BRCA1</i>); and (c) ecogenetics, which
concerns gene and environment interactions
(e.g., Epstein-Barr virus causing lymphoma
in individuals with specific genes). Genetic
information may have serious psychological
effects, including anxiety and stress in healthy
and sick individuals as well as in their children.
Studies have shown that individuals at
risk might not undergo screening, especially if
their fear is high. Furthermore, their readiness
to participate in health-promoting procedures,
including prophylactic treatment,
depends on their anxiety, education, and
beliefs about their likelihood of getting sick
(Kash &amp; Lerman, 1998).


<i>
<b>Models of the Problem</b>
</i>


Models in psycho-oncology about the etiology
and prognosis of cancer form part of the
more encompassing approach of biopsychosocial
medicine, which has replaced the more
limited approach of biomedical medicine and
assumes that psychological factors are involved
in physical disorders. Thus, in regard to disease
incidence, it is assumed that each disease is
caused by some pathogen (e.g., microbe, virus,
material with detrimental effects for the organism
such as radioactivity or carcinogens). As
illustrated in Figure 17.1, the effect of the
pathogen is not automatic rather, it depends
on background factors such as the organism's
genetic tendencies, nutritional state, immune
system, comorbidity, psychological factors,
and characteristics specific to the particular
disease (e.g., lipids and blood pressure in cardiological
disorders). Likewise, the effect of the
treatment on recovery is not automatic; rather,
it depends on background factors that are of

[p. <i>339</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00349&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I030&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Most of the etiological models in psychooncology
are based on psycho-neuroimmunology
(Bovbjerg &amp; Valdimarsdottir, 1998;
Goodkin &amp; Visser, 2000). According to this discipline,
the causal matrix consists of a multiplicity
of factors derived from different domains,
mainly the neurological, immune, endocrinological,
and psychosocial domains. However, the
models differ in the interactions assumed among
the factors, in the nature of the embedded causal
links, in the emphasis placed on factors of different
domains, and in the manner in which the
different factors are structured and positioned in
relation to one another. Most often, the immune
system is placed in a central position and the rest
of the factors are considered insofar as they
affect immunological parameters (Finn, 2001;
Garssen &amp; Goodkin, 1999). The effect of
psychological factors on cancer is assumed to be
through the immune system (Bovbjerg &amp;
Valdimarsdottir, 1998). However, because the
overall effect of the immune system on tumor
growth appears to be moderate on the whole, a
variety of pathways are explored to account for
the effects of psychological factors. One such
pathway is infections, to which cancer patients
may be particularly vulnerable and which
form the major cause of cancer-related deaths
(Bovbjerg &amp; Valdimarsdottir, 1998; White,
1993). Two other likely pathways are stress,
which functions through alterations in the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the
hypothalamic-sympathetic-medullary axis
(Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Glaser, 1999), and depression,
which functions through alterations in the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid
axis, and the
hypothalamic-growth hormone axis (Mussel-man,
McDaniel, Porter, &amp; Nemeroff, 1998).
Notably, it has been suggested that more weight

<b>Diagnostic and Etiological Issues</b>

<i>
<b>Clinical Description</b>
</i>


A great number of studies have examined
the prevalence of mental health disorders in
cancer patients. According to a review based
on the findings of the first cooperative group
organized for the study of these issues, 53% of
cancer patients had "normal responses to cancer,"
whereas 47% had different psychiatric
diagnoses: 32% adjustment disorders with
symptoms of depression and anxiety, 6%
major depression, 4% organic mental disorders
(dementia or delirium), and 5% preexisting
psychiatric disorders (3% personality
disorders, 2% anxiety disorders) (Derogatis
et al., 1983). Of all psychiatric disorders
observed, 89% were related to the disease and
the treatments, whereas only 11% represented
prior psychiatric problems. Other studies,
using various assessment instruments and
criteria, reported 14% to 31% of cancer survivors
with psychiatric diagnoses (for a review,
see Kornblith, 1998). The estimates of the
reviewed studies resemble the earlier estimate,
considering that adjustment disorders are an
intermediary state between normal coping
under stress and pathology.


The prevalence of <i>adjustment disorders</i> is
due to the special stresses of cancer: the duration
and difficulties of treatments, the side
effects of treatments, the fear of recurrence, the
impairment of body image, and so on.
Adjustment disorders are more frequent during
the early phases of cancer and often subside
with time or evolve into another diagnosis. In
one study with adult patients, after 5 years,
71% were completely symptom free, whereas
21% had deteriorated into major depression
or alcoholism (Andreasen &amp; Hoenk, 1982).


<i>Depressive symptoms</i> are the most frequent
kind of mental health problem in cancer
patients. The estimates of their prevalence
range from 1% to 53% in the various studies
(DeFlorio amp; Massie, 1995). The reasons for
the variation are differences in the tools of
assessment, in the diagnoses (e.g., major
depression, unipolar depression, dysthymic
disorder), in the group of cancer patients in
which depression is assessed (e.g., pancreatic,
breast), and in the phase of the disease in
which depression is assessed (e.g., preliminary,
advanced). The tools of assessment vary
in the ways in which they solve the problem
of overlap in symptoms between depression
proper and cancer (i.e., the disease and its
treatments). There are four major approaches
to this issue: (a) the inclusive (counts all
symptoms regardless of origin), (b) the etiological
(counts only symptoms due to depression
proper), (c) the substitutive (replaces
indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue with
cognitive symptoms such as brooding), and
(d) the exclusive (eliminates all symptoms due
to the disease or treatment and uses other
depression criteria). The narrower the definition,
the lower the observed prevalence of
depression. On the whole, depression is also
quite frequent in other medically sick people,
with its prevalence ranging from 5% to 55%
(Popkin &amp; Tucker, 1992).


Of the varieties of depression, the most
prevalent in cancer patients is depressed mood
coupled with a general adjustment disorder,
followed by unipolar depression. Depression
is higher in some cancer diagnoses than in
others, for example, breast cancer survivors
versus testis cancer survivors (Gritz, Wellisch,
&amp; Landsverk, 1988; Sneeuw et al., 1992).
Advanced disease stage is often correlated
with more depression. The factors contributing
to depression in cancer patients include
disabling symptoms, lower Karnovsky

[p. <i>341</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00351&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although the total number of cancer
patients who commit suicide is low, the risk of
suicide in cancer patients is double that in the
general population (Campbell, 1996). Factors
correlated with the risk for suicide include gender
(being male [in adults], being female [in
adolescents]), site of cancer (particularly oral,
pharyngeal, and lung cancers), medical state
(e.g., advanced disease, poor prognosis, suffering
due to pain and fatigue), and preexisting
psychopathology (e.g., suicide attempts, psychosis).
Suicide ideation seems to be much
more frequent than suicide intent or actual suicide
attempts (Breitbart, 1990). Suicidal
thoughts expressed during preterminal stages
also are often not steady; may subside when
patients get empathy and social support.
Suicidal ideation of patients may at times
express primarily their desire for control, their
need to test their relatives, and/or attempts to
reduce their fear of death (Kreitler &amp;
Merimsky, in press).


The prevalence of <i>anxiety disorders</i> in cancer
patients is probably higher than in other
medical conditions but its extent is uncertain
due to varying criteria, assessment instruments,
and samples. Estimates vary from 15%
to 28% (Carroll, Kathol, Noyes, Wald, &amp;
Clamon, 1993). There are no consistent findings
about the gender, cancer site, age, and
marital status correlates of anxiety. Anxiety
appears to increase in the course of treatments
(surgery and chemotherapy) and particularly
with the advance of disease. It may be viewed
as a more or less constant accompaniment of
the different vicissitudes of the disease.
Anxiety may also be evoked, by different
metabolic states (e.g., hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia),
hormone-secreting tumors, and
various drugs (e.g., corticosteroids). Its
manifestations include emotional lability,
tension, fear, dependence, withdrawal, and an
enhanced tendency to become nauseous
(Noyes, Holt, &amp; Massie, 1998).


During recent years, increasing attention has
been devoted to posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) in cancer patients and survivors.
Research was spurred particularly by the high
prevalence of avoidant and intrusive symptoms
in this population (Greenberg, Goorin,
Gebhardt, Petersen, &amp; Hirji, 1994). In some
studies, up to 44% of patients reported PTSD-like
symptoms (Cordova et al., 1995). Yet only
4% to 10% of cancer survivors actually met
criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD (Alter et al.,
1996), as compared with 25% to 33% of individuals
exposed to traumatic events (Yehuda,
Resnick, Kahana, &amp; Giller, 1993). One important
result of PTSD is that it renders recurrent
exposures to medical tests and treatments more
difficult emotionally for patients.


Of particular importance are <i>neuropsychiatric
effects</i> due to side effects of chemotherapeutic
agents or abnormal metabolic
states often observed in cancer patients. For
example, 5-fluorouracil may cause memory
loss and confusional episodes; ifosfamide may
cause hallucinations, somnolence, and mutism
(Tuxen &amp; Hansen, 1994); interferon alpha
may cause agitation, emotional lability, and
personality change (Quesada, Talpaz, Rios,
Kurzrock, &amp; Gutterman, 1986); and hypo- or
hypercortisolism and hypo- or hypercalcemia
may cause depression, delirium, and dementia
(Fleishman, Lesko, &amp; Breitbart, 1993).


<i>
<b>Typical Etiologies</b>
</i>


In trying to understand the psychological
state or reactions of cancer patients, it is always
recommended to apply a broad multidisciplinary
approach and to assume interactions of

[p. <i>342</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00352&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<b>Assessment and Treatment</b>

<i>
<b>Assessment</b>
</i>


The major assessments in psycho-oncology
are focused on evaluating psychological
distress, QOL, physical symptoms,
and cognitive state.


<i>Psychological Distress</i>. Evaluating or screening
for current or future psychological distress
is of great importance in view of the relative
paucity of professional psycho-oncologists and
sometimes the reluctance of patients to admit to
their psychological distress because they may
regard it as a sign of weakness. The evaluations
are usually based on a structured interview or
self-report measures. The best known is the
package referred to as Omega Screening
Instruments, which is a structured interview
combined with a self-report measure. It enables
constructing the patient's profile on the basis
of his or her responses to questions about past
history (e.g., mental health, substance abuse)
and social support (e.g., marriage, church),
answers to the Inventory of Current Concerns,
and demographic facts (Weisman, Worden &amp;
Sobel, 1980). The four measures that are commonly
used and are most reliable among
the self-report tools are the Brief Symptom
Inventory (BSI) (Derogatis, 1993), which consists
of 53 items and provides scores on 10
scales (e.g., hostility, anxiety, paranoia) and 3
global scores (Global Severity Index, Positive
Symptom Distress Index, and Positive
Symptom Total); the Profile of Mood States
(POMS) (McNair, Lorr, &amp; Droppelman,
1971), which consists of 65 items and provides
scores on 6 scales (e.g., anger-hostility, tension-anxiety)
and 1 global score (Total Mood
Disturbance); the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS) (Johnson et al.,
1995), which consists of 14 items and provides
scores on 2 scales (anxiety and depression); and
the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form
Health Survey (MOS SF-36) (McHorney et al.,
1993), which consists of 36 items and provides
scores on 8 scales (e.g., physical, pain, social,
vitality).


<i>Quality of Life</i>. Major assessment
instruments of QOL include the European
Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer (EORTC), which is based largely on
particular modules for different cancer diseases
(Aaronson et al., 1993); the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) scale
(Cella et al., 1993), which is also based on specific
modules for each cancer disease and
requests evaluation of extent to which QOL

<i>Physical Symptoms</i>. The assessment of
physical symptoms may be part of the assessment
of QOL or independent of it. Most often,
it is based on self-report symptom checklists
that refer to multiple or single symptoms. Two
examples of multiple symptom tools are
the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale
(MSAS), which refers to 32 physical and psychological
symptoms (e.g., feeling nervous,
lack of energy)--each rated in terms of intensity,
frequency, and distress--and provides
scores on a Global Distress Index and the two
physical and psychological subscales (Portenoy
et al., 1994), and the Rotterdam Symptom
Checklist, which refers to 30 physical and psychological
symptoms, assesses their impact on
physical activity and function, and provides the
same scores as does the MSAS (de Haes, van
Kippenberg, &amp; Neijt, 1990).


Examples of frequently used tools that measure
specific symptoms include the Brief Pain
Inventory (BPI) (Daut, Cleeland, &amp; Flanery,
1983), which assesses pain history, intensity,
location, quality, and interference with overall
functioning; the McGill Pain Questionnaire
(MPQ) (Melzack, 1975), which evaluates
through verbal descriptors the sensory, affective,
and evaluative dimensions of pain; the
20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory
(MFI) (Smets, Garssen, Bonke, &amp; de Haes,
1995); and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)
for dyspnea (Borg, 1982).


<i>Cognitive State</i>. Some of the tools for
assessing mental state focus on cognitive
deficits, whereas others deal more specifically
with delirium and confusional states. The
Cognitive Capacity Screening Examination
(CCSE) (Jacobs, 1977), which screens for
organic mental syndromes, and the Mini-Mental
State Exam (MMSE) (Folstein, Fetting,
Lobo, Niaz, &amp; Capozolli, 1984), which is the
standard mental state instrument, are based on
examining basic processes such as orientation
in time and place, instantaneous recall, short-term
memory, simple number calculations,
and the use of language. The Neurobehavioral
Cognitive Status Examination (NCSE)
(Kiernan, Mueller, Langston, &amp; Van Dyke,
1987) assesses level of consciousness, orientation,
attention, and five major ability areas
(language, constructions, memory, calculations,
and reasoning). More specific delirium
assessment tools, based on clinicians' ratings,
include the Delirium Rating Scale, with 10
items based on DSM-III (<i>Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>, third
edition [American Psychiatric Association,
1988]) criteria scanning diverse aspects such as
perceptual disturbance, psychomotor behavior,
hallucinations, and lability of mood
(Trzepacz, Baker, &amp; Greenhouse, 1988), and
the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale,
with 10 items based on DSM-IV (American
Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria scanning
disturbances in arousal and consciousness
as well as in cognitive functioning and psychomotor
activity (Breitbart et al., 1997).


<b>
<i>Goals of Treatment</i>
</b>


There are a great many psycho-oncological
interventions with a diversity of goals.
Most are tailored to the specific needs and
benefits of the patients. The main six goals of
interventions are crisis overcoming, problem
solving, patient education, adjustment, medical
survival, and prevention. The first five
deal with treating the patients and sometimes
also family members. The sixth targets primarily
the population at large.


<i>Crisis overcoming</i> is designed to help the
patient through the most difficult physical and

[p. <i>344</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00354&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Problem solving</i> is designed to help the
patient solve typical disease- or treatment-related
problems such as whether or how to
tell others (e.g., parents, partner, children, colleagues
at work) about the disease or its recurrence
and whether to go on working during
chemotherapy. Some of the patient's problems
may have existed before the disease but were
exacerbated through it (e.g., family tensions
concerning partner behavior or finances).


<i>Patient education</i> is designed to provide the
patient with information and skills to enable
optimal use of medical resources and services
(e.g., getting services such as psychological
help, sex counseling, tax deductions, and social
benefits) while minimizing harassment and
different avoidable difficulties. It also includes
skills at getting and evaluating medical information,
assistance in clarifying misperceptions
and misinformation, and suggestions for
improving doctor-patient communication.


<i>Adjustment</i> is designed to reduce as much
as possible the patient's psychological distress
in the course of treatment or remission periods
by controlling anxiety and depression on a
long-term basis; reducing feelings of loneliness,
isolation, and hopelessness; improving
coping skills; raising the level of QOL; and
possibly even promoting personal growth and
happiness beyond the levels attained prior to
the disease. Living with cancer and living well
are the goals of adjustment.


<i>Medical survival</i> is focused on using psychological
processes to improve the patient's
chances for longer survival or to extend the disease-free
intervals. Sometimes, this goal is considered
as strengthening the patient's immune
system (Finn, 2001).


<i>Prevention</i> is focused on reducing the prevalence
of cancer by enhancing compliance with
screening guidelines in the population at large,
and particularly in individuals at risk, and by
modifying behaviors that increase the risk of
cancer (e.g., improper diet, exposure to the sun,
use of tobacco) (Cohen &amp; Baum, 2001).


<b>
<i>Types of Treatment</i>
</b>


There are great variety of psychological
treatments applied in the framework of psycho-oncology.
Often, more than one are used conjointly
or within the same setup. The major
types of interventions are counseling, dynamic
psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, behavioral
therapy, existential therapy, psychoeducational
therapy, group therapy, social support, art therapy,
and guided imagery. Although the names
of most of these interventions are familiar from
other domains in psychology, their application
in psycho-oncology is specific in several
respects. First, treatments are focused on the
disease with the more or less implicit assumption
that the major goal is to minimize the distress
occasioned by the disease and the
treatments. Second, another implicit assumption
is that if it were not for the cancer, the
patient would not be exposed to that particular
psychological intervention. Third, interactions
between psychological and physiological processes
constitute an integral part of the treatment,
sometimes as a focal theme (e.g., in the
life-extending therapies) and other times merely
as a fact that is taken into consideration (e.g., in
treating insomnia, the chemotherapeutic agents
that the patient is getting are considered).

[p. <i>345</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00355&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />


Two major modes of treatment are
individual therapy and group therapy. Individual
therapy is more costly in resources but is
tailored better to the needs of the specific
patient and shields him or her against the anxieties
evoked by the vicissitudes in the state of
other patients (i.e., downward comparisons)
and against the tendency to devote himself
or herself too much to helping others. For
objective reasons, individual therapy may be
the only option for patients with advanced
disease. Group therapy is more economical,
enjoys a good "reputation" in many communities,
and may be less threatening for patients
(Helgeson, Cohen, Schulz, &amp; Yasco, 2001).


Each of the major kinds of treatment has
been used for attaining the different goals of
treatments. Thus, group therapy has been used
for life extension, adjustment, and psycho-educational
purposes (Fawzy &amp; Fawzy, 1998;
Spira, 1998), and art therapy has been used for
adjustment and vocation of self-healing potentialities
(Luzzatto &amp; Gabriel, 1998).


The major therapeutic components or
processes used in the various treatments are
getting the support of others (e.g., patients,
health professionals), eliminating mainly negative
affect, sharing one's experiences with
others, learning coping skills, facing one's
fears (including fears of suffering, pain, and
death), overcoming despair and strengthening
hope, gaining a better understanding of oneself
and one's responses, gaining a better
understanding of the situation (e.g., the disease,
treatments), strengthening one's sense of
control, and gaining a modicum of control
over one's symptoms. Some of these elements
are stronger in some of the treatments; for
example, getting support is often stronger in
group therapy, whereas gaining a better
understanding of oneself and one's responses
is more salent in individual therapy.


There exist some better-known treatment
protocols, mainly Spiegel's supportive-expressive
therapy (Spiegel &amp; Diamond, 2002)
and Fawzy's psychoeducational intervention
(Fawzy et al., 2001). Each is based on using the
components mentioned previously in a more or
less structured manner. Thus, Spiegel's group
therapy is based on supporting other patients
and receiving support from them, getting family
support, getting social support, improving emotional
expression, detoxifying death, reordering
life priorities, facilitating communication with
one's physician, and controlling symptoms (by
self-hypnosis, meditation, biofeedback, etc.).
Fawzy's psychoeducational intervention is
based on getting health education (being
informed, about cancer), managing stress (identifying
sources of stress, identifying one's reactions
to stress, and controlling these reactions by
hypnosis, relaxation, guided imagery, etc.),
learning coping skills (using problem-solving
techniques based on promoting the active
approach and weakening avoidance coping),
and getting psychological support from the staff.


There are four major therapeutic orientations
used in the various treatments: the
dynamic approach, the cognitive-behavioral
approach, the existential approach, and the
cognitive orientation approach. The dynamic
approach is rooted in classical psychotherapy,
so that it is based, on applying transference and
countertransference, exploring the patient's
past, interpreting dreams and free associations,
and using a specific structure of interplay
between contents and process (Sourkes,
Massie, &amp; Holland, 1998). The cognitive-behavioral
approach emphasizes the acquisition
of skills (thoughts, beliefs, or behaviors)
that enable controlling symptoms, mainly
stress, pain, and anxiety. The most often used
means are hypnosis, relaxation, systematic
desensitization, guided imagery, and coping
self-statements (Jacobsen &amp; Harm, 1998). The
existential approach is based on exploring the
function, role, and meaning of the lives of
humans in general and the life of the patient in
particular while examining the authenticity of
assumptions about oneself and the world in
the framework of one's culture and society
(Spira, 2000). Finally, the cognitive orientation

[p. <i>346</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00356&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I031&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Most treatments report effects in terms of
reducing patients' distress and improving
their emotional well-being (Fawzy &amp; Fawzy,
1998; Fawzy et al., 2001; Jacobsen &amp; Hann,
1998). The effects of the treatments on
survival are less clear. Spiegel and colleagues
(1999) initially reported a remarkable effect
of their intervention on prolonging survival.
However, as noted earlier, their study had
serious methodological shortcomings (Fox,
1998a; Kogon et al., 1997) and failed to be
replicated (Goodwin et al., 2001; Spiegel
et al., 1999). The replications showed that
the intervention proved to affect only
patients' mood (Goodwin et al., 2001;
Spiegel et al., 1999) and did this for only a
short duration (Edmonds, Lockwood, &amp;
Cunningham, 1999).


Fawzy and colleagues (2001) showed that
their intervention had positive effects on
immune system parameters 6 months after
treatment, but the effects did not differ significantly
between the intervention and control
groups after 1 year. Furthermore, when the
treatment and Breslow depth were used
together as predictors, treatment did not predict
recurrence of disease but instead predicted
survival. The results were explained as due to
better adjustment and coping in the experimental
group. However, the number of participants
was very small (3 were dead and 31
were alive in the experimental group, and 10
were dead and 24 were alive in the control

[p. <i>348</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00358&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As discussed previously, the cognitive orientation
approach has also led to significant
increases of survival in the intervention
group that lasted for 12 years, which is the
follow-up period to date. Notably, the cognitive
orientation variables predicted survival
together with the medical prognostic variables,
and the effect of the psychological factors
became more evident the longer the time
since diagnosis (Kreitler, In bar, &amp; Kreitler,
1999; Kreitler et al., 1997).


Furthermore, there are less conventional
interventions of the mind-body sphere that
mostly share several of the following components:
emphasis on a holistic approach, positive
attitude, mind-body unity, personal
responsibility for one's health, belief in the possibility
to control bodily processes, and frequent
use of procedures from the Kabala,
Reiki, meditation, and spiritual approaches.
Results are mostly not evidence based and
remain equivocal at best.


Finally, many cancer patients use psychopharmacological
drugs for the control of
symptoms in one or another phase of the disease.
The most frequently prescribed drugs
are antidepressants and antianxiety medications
as well as analgesics and insomnia-controlling
drugs (Massie &amp; Lesko, 1989).

<b>Summary and Conclusions</b>

Psycho-oncology is one of the most active
domains of health psychology and has earned
for itself a relatively central role in health
psychology as well as in oncology. The two
main reasons for this are (a) the great need for
psychological help on the part of patients and
physicians alike (albeit for different reasons)
and (b) the theoretical and empirical advances
in gaining knowledge and understanding in
oncology contributed by adding the psychological
perspective to the scientific and clinical
research. Psycho-oncology has become deeply
interwoven in the daily practice of and research
in oncology. This has made it possible to detect
its contributions in the most varied domains of
oncology, ranging from prevention, genetic
testing, and counseling to decisions about treatment,
launching of new drugs supported by
QOL arguments, and euthanasia. However, if
psycho-oncology is to maintain its very unique
status in practice and research, three recommendations
seem appropriate.


The first recommendation is increased
emphasis on considering multiple background
variables. This would entail assuming
an inherently interactional and synergistic
approach in every act of applying psychooncology.
The second is increased emphasis
on considering a variety of specifically
medical variables such as histology, type of
tumor, and genetic aspects. This would lead
to widening the scope and generalizability of
psycho-oncological findings. The third is
adopting a broader and more creative
approach to identifying and testing purely
psychological variables. This would enable
enriching the host of familiar variables, such
as depression and emotional suppression, that
have contributed to advancing the field up to
the current level.

<b>Case Study</b>

"S. M." was a 37-year-old woman, married with three daughters, who was diagnosed
with melanoma (Stage IIb) in the cervix. She underwent surgery and was prescribed
a course of chemotherapy. She kept delaying the beginning of the treatment
with different excuses until she was given up in the hospital files as a case of "treatment
resistance." A year later, she showed up for a regular follow-up, and it turned
out that there had been disease recurrence. When the doctor raised the need for
chemotherapy, S. M. again declared that she would not undergo any kind of
treatment--"not now, not ever." The doctor responded by saying, "No one can be
forced to undergo treatment, but I suggest that since you are already here you see
the attending psycho-oncologist." S. M. said, "I will do so, but only because you
are such a kind doctor who has agreed not to prescribe chemotherapy for me."


At the beginning of the meeting with the psycho-oncologist, S. M. said that she did
not believe in psychology and that all that psychologists had to say was mere "literary
fiction." The psychologist suggested that S. M. might want to tell the psychologist
some "fictional story." S. M. readily agreed and started to tell a story about two
sisters, 1 year apart in age, who were so close and inseparable that most of those who
knew them thought they had a lesbian relationship, which of course was not true.
When they were ages 16 and 17 years, they were invited by their uncle to spend a
vacation in Canada. It is there that they went on a boat tour on the St. Lawrence
River and one sister accidentally fell off the boat into the water and drowned. The
other sister did not jump in to try to save her, even though she was a much better
swimmer. The surviving sister went back to her own country, and because she was
now the only child, she was spoiled by her parents and lived happily ever after.


The psychologist assumed the role of a "literary critic" and offered the remark
that the end of the story was not convincing from a literary point of view because
it seemed likely that the surviving sister suffered from a sense of guilt. S. M. rejected
the criticism but agreed to explore the possibility that some readers of such a story
might get the "wrong" idea that the surviving sister felt guilty. S. M. suggested that
the surviving sister may have wished the other sister dead for fear that the dead
sister would not have allowed her to marry and have children because "they loved
too much." The psychologist then remarked, "Some people who feel guilty for
actual or imaginary things they have done or felt consider undergoing chemotherapy
as a kind of punishment. What do you think?" "Funny," S. M. said, "I thought
chemotherapy was quite the contrary--the means for life."


S. M. did not come back to the psycho-oncologist, but she underwent the whole
course of chemotherapy without any resistance. At the end of the treatment, she
left the psycho-oncologist a note stating, "For me chemotherapy was a punishment,
and now I have earned my right to live." Her response to the treatment was
good, and after 5 years she was still in full remission.


This case illustrates the use of a brief psychological intervention for resolving
noncompliance with treatment and possibly also the contribution of psychological
change to medical remission.
