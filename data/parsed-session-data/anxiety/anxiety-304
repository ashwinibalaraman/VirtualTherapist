SO much for the moment for the bars. We must now
deploy ourselves at the barricades.


Readers of the first part of my autobiography will
realize how the experiences of the early part of my
life made my mental constitution that of a revolutionary.
Now, in my middle thirties, I had no cause either through
personal circumstances, or through increased knowledge
of life, or on account of developments in the world of
affairs, to alter my view.


What was I up against? It is my duty to my readers to
summarize this as best I can. I can do this in simple,
straightforward manner. I was a rebel against an "ethos,"
a social climate in which—so it seemed to me—mental
energy and ability not only failed to signify, but were at a
discount; in which seniority—or perhaps one should say
senility, social prestige, family tradition were elevated in
the conduct of our affairs to the degree almost of Chinese
ancestor worship. I was a rebel against a society whose
very maintenance required the deliberate inculcation
of mental sloth, required also unquestioning subservience
to narrow loyalty at the expense of broad principle;
a society too, that rested upon a widespread prevalence
of moral cowardice that militated against any form of
political independence in speech or action.


For such was the state of England in the nineteen-thirties;
and all the woes that came upon England during
the years of which I write were due to these things rather

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was against these things that I pitted all my puny
strength. These were the dragons which I set out to slay.
All the sense of vocation that had been denied me in
my medical career poured itself into my political aspirations.
The Voice of the Lord spoke to me as He did to
the Infant Samuel and I replied in due humility, "Here
am I. Send me." As those who have undergone similar
dedication know, this is a call which supercedes worldly
ties, domestic obligations, personal comfort, even the
ordinary workaday ambitions of conventional life. And
it was in this mood of sacrifice that I viewed the political
scene.


To anyone seeking to fulfil the Lord's will in righteousness
and, what was equally important, in accordance
with the tenets of ordinary common sense, the vista
presented by British politics in the year 1935 was a
particularly unpromising one.


"Politics" said my numerous mentors with one accord
whenever I mentioned my intentions, "Well, you've got
to join a Party."


I could not help but agree. The Wavertree by-election
in which I had taken part early in 1935, and one or two
subsequent excursions into the "Independent" field
that I had made, painfully bore on me the fact that an
Independent candidature for Parliament was an impracticable
proposition. It can now be generally agreed that
the world of 1935 was a world gone mad, but it is not
easy to convince a world-gone-mad that one is the only
sane person in it—not in the course of a single brief
election campaign anyway. A world-gone-mad is apt
to think of the proposition as being the other way round.


All the same, to enter Party politics in 1935 was clearly
enough to enter the portals of a lunatic asylum. On one
hand were the Government leaders, showing the signs of

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This had been my quandary—the choice between two
lunacies. A quandary that had become the more harrowing
as the General Election of 1935 approached. Bent on
action as I was, I had clearly to wait for a further "sign"
before putting my intentions into practice.


It had been the middle of August, 1935, before this
was vouchsafed to me. We were on holiday—Christiane,
"Granny," Christopher and I—at the Pension Beau
Sejour of Tante Butaye at Heyst-sur-Mer, Belgium. As
we sat down to our continental breakfast in the long
dining room overlooking the sea, I noticed an unfamiliar-looking
envelope addressed in a slightly unsteady copperplate
handwriting amongst my morning post. I opened
this, unaware that in these contents too destiny awaited
me; and this is what I read:

Dear Dr. Johnson,


We have heard from a very reliable source that you are seriously
considering standing as a Candidate for Parliament at the next
General Election.


As a native of this Borough, the son of a gentleman who was
very highly respected, and deservedly so, by the great majority
of the members of the three political parties we should cordially
welcome you as the Liberal Candidate for the Borough at the next
General Election, and invite you to become that Candidate.

Will you please let me have your decision as early as possible?


Yours very sincerely<br />
O. L. W. WHITEHEAD,<br />
<i>Chairman</i>.


The Liberal Party! I had not thought seriously of the
Liberal Party. My father had been a Liberal and I had
always thought of myself as "something of a Liberal,"
but, particularly in the southern suburbs of London
where I had lived for so long, the Liberal Party did not
signify. It was what so many of my friends said it was—
a thing of the past.


"Do get on with your breakfast, darling," exhorted
Chris, "we want to go on the sands before the tide comes
in."


But, regardless of Christiane's exhortations, I left my
roll unfinished and walked out by myself, away from the
family, along the Digue of Heyst-sur-Mer to breathe the
bracing air of the North Sea and to cogitate. All the same
(so my train of thought continued) the Liberal Party was
a political party with many of its local organizations still
intact and with the potentialities of building up on these.
Old-fashioned as it might be, perhaps it only waited for
young people, for keen spirits within its ranks, to revitalize
it. And, since earlier in that year of 1935, when
the Liberal Party had agreed to support the necessity for
armaments while making a stand for principle in our
foreign affairs, it at least had a coherence in its policy
that the other two parties lacked.


So—in brief—my mind ran. As I finished the mile
across the sand dunes to the outlying resort of Duinbergen,
I had seen my path. The Lord had sent His sign.
I walked quickly back to the Beau Sejour and sat down at

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Good evening, Doctor Donald."


The little bow-legged man in the shiny blue serge
suit, who was standing by the door, welcomed me
ceremoniously.


It was by now mid-October and, the preliminary
negotiations over, I was now to meet the Bury Liberal
Association to be adopted as their Prospective Candidate.
By the time I arrived, the meeting room of the Bury
Chamber of Commerce in Silver Street was already filled
to capacity with the subscribing members of the Association,
agog with curiosity for the sight of me in my new
prospective prominence.


"Come along, now, Doctor Donald. I'll introduce you
to some o' t' friends. Then you can sit yourself down and
we'll start t' meeting," continued the little bow-legged
man, whom I already knew as Robert Garnett, the agent
of the Association.


A dozen or more introductions effected, Garnett
escorted me forwards to the far end of the room.


"Sit yourself down there, Doctor Donald." Garnett
indicated an uncomfortable-looking straight-backed chair,
poised precariously near the front of the narrow platform.
"Then we'll get started."


I mounted the platform and sat myself down. Feeling
more than a little conspicuous on my perch, I tried by
means of a series of discreet glances to take stock of my
future supporters. As, for the first time, I surveyed the
Bury Liberal Association <i>en masse</i>—row beyond row of
lower middle-class, Northern provincial folk whose

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Inexorably at 7.30 sharp the Chairman opened the
meeting. Old Mr. Whitehead, worthy retired schoolmaster,
spoke in diffuse fashion of the importance of the
occasion, and of my own merits as Prospective Candidate.
My body was a prisoner to its seat on the edge of the
platform as Mr. Whitehead continued to speak, regardless
of the normal time limit of a Chairman's speech, but my
mind ranged free. I thought of the comments of my
various friends to my announcement that I was to embark
on public life as a Liberal Candidate, the pleas that I
was tying myself to a corpse, that I was clutching at a
straw, that I should write and cancel while there was still
time.


"The Liberal Party! Well, Donald, you've certainly
joined the rottenest Party. Teetotallers and nonconformists—those
are your people," had been my old friend
Charles Plumstead's opinion.


The thought of his comments brought me back with a
jolt. Here I was. Here was my revolutionary army. Here
was my crusading force. Oh, dear me!


But Mr. Whitehead, with a final tribute to "brilliant
young men" and about "the future belonging to youth,"
was at last coming to the end of his speech. He was
followed by a more rousing oration from Arthur Worsley,
the ebullient Area Secretary of the North Western
Liberal Federation.


Then it was my own turn to address the meeting. As
was usual at this stage of my career, I was half-paralysed
by nervousness. My speech had been carefully prepared

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But I was soon recalled to a sense of reality. Farsighted
as my speech might have been, it was not the
speech the Bury Liberal Association wanted to hear from
a prospective candidate. There was no doubt about that.
I had yet to learn the arts of the politician and in my
ignorance of these I had, all unwittingly, incurred the
anger of the Gods. Nemesis came swiftly when my proposer,
the Congregationalist Minister, the Reverend
Bushrod, rose from the body of the hall.


"Dr. Donald Johnson has told us what he believes,
my friends," began the Reverend Bushrod, "and we
appreciate his honesty. But if Dr. Johnson really believes
what he has told us, he is not the sort of Liberal Candidate
that I want to see in Bury...."


The lean figure of the Reverend Bushrod, behind his
black frock coat and high turned-down collar, became the
incarnation of avenging Jehovah. Too late did I realize
how I had strayed and erred in my ways as the minister's
words of disapprobation found the approval of his listeners.


"Dr. Johnson evidently lacked faith in the League of
Nations." "Dr. Johnson had talked on economics for

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Momentarily I was seized with panic. I may have felt
doubts of my mission, but I had not looked for this!
I saw myself in imminent danger of a public repudiation
at the hands of these frightening people. Fortunately,
however, there was my father's memory as a former
Chairman of the Association; there were my relatives,
my cousin Annie and my Aunt Laura, still serving on the
Committee of the Association. Even the Reverend
Bushrod had to compromise. He started to recall with
affection my father's services. The corner had been
turned. The awkward moment was over. Perhaps (rather
grudgingly admitted the Reverend Bushrod) he himself
was an old man—one had to move with the times and
be open to other points of view. With something of a
sigh, he begged to propose the Resolution that "this
Association adopts Dr. Donald Johnson as Prospective
Candidate for the Parliamentary Division of Bury and
pledges itself to support him at the poll."


The formal seconder of the Resolution spoke from the
back of the hall. Then, after him, others from amongst
the audience gave their views. Some made clear their
expectation that their candidate would "take a firm stand
for Peace." Others were enthusiastic for a Liberal
Candidate—"but"—one after the other, they put out
only slightly guarded hints—"there were those who
called themselves Liberals, yet who were not sound on

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, to my relief, the Resolution was carried
<i>nem con</i>. I had entered public life as the chosen representative
of the Bury Liberal Association.


Family influence had pulled me through.


(3)


The meeting had taken place on a Wednesday, and I
had arranged to spend the remainder of the week in
Bury. The General Election was due during the autumn,
as everyone now knew, and there was no time to lose.
I reported, therefore, the following morning to the
Trevelyan Club where, in a dingy back room furnished
only by a worn strip of carpet and a dirty green baizecovered
table; I found Robert Garnett.


"Good morning, Dr. Donald," greeted Robert Garnett.
"Here you are. Ready for t' fight?"


He got up from his chair and shook my hand with
fervour. It was a red-letter day in Garnett's life, this
welcoming of a new candidate into his office where it
must often have seemed that no candidate would ever
tread again.


"Now sit yourself down and we'll see what we've got."


Robert Garnett was short in stature, of a rough,
homely countenance, almost completely bald, and as
bandy-legged as a prize bull-dog. He was in fact no great
shakes to look at. But his heart was large with an all-pervading
optimism. During his fifty odd years of life
he had by laborious process of self-education worked
himself up from half-timer in the cotton mills to his

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Now, Dr. Donald," he began in deliberate tones,
emphasizing each item in his Lancashire accent as he
spoke. "You've got a winning hand if you'll only play
your cards properly. Si'thee now. Look at this. You've
got fourteen Town Councillors—Tories have only sixteen
and Labour's nobbut four—and we're winning votes
in' t' Council Elections all t' time. You've got six Liberal
Clubs all over t' Town. Then there's Women's Association
as'll work for you; and Young Liberals as well.
You'll get th' Nonconformists voting for you—that is,
if you nurse 'em a bit. And you should get th' Catholic
Vote too, and if you get th' Catholic Vote, you've won for
certain. Of course, we've had no candidate here since
Mr. Ickringall in 1929, but he came in three weeks before
th' Election and got six thousand votes—you'll double
that easy with your local connections—then if t' Tories
lose some of theirs to Labour you've beaten 'em and no
mistake."


Garnett continued to build castles in the air in this
fashion for some fifteen minutes, while I listened and
said nothing. Then he got down to brass tacks.


"Well now, Dr. Donald. Si'thee. I've told thee nigh
on everything and here's programme as I've drawn up.
You've got to go out and meet people and tell 'em as
you're a Bury man. A Bury man for Bury—that's our
slogan and we're going to win wi' it. Here you are now.
This morning you and me are going out and we're going
round t' streets and we're going to meet hundreds of
individual voters." (I looked at the programme on the
table, and sure enough, Garnett had it written down in

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Before I had time to reply, Garnett already had his
bowler hat on and was ready to go.


"Come on now, Dr. Donald. I've said as I'd introduce
you round t' Market and they'll be wanting to see you.
‘A Bury man for Bury.’ That's some 'ut as Tories can't
say."


We went out, first across to the Market for an introduction
to a stall-keeper; then to a little old woman round
the corner in Crompton Street; then a little further out
to contact an old-standing subscriber in Paradise Street.
Garnett waddled along beside me, stopping now and then
to introduce me to a passing acquaintance, basking in the
sunshine of glory reflected from his prospective candidate.


"Champion, Dr. Donald, champion! You're charming
'em all!" he chattered his encouragement as we went
along. "Personal introductions. That's t' way as Bobbie
Phillips won his election back in 1880. And they'll all talk."


The two of us together undoubtedly looked a comic
sight as we tramped over the pavings and cobblestones of
Bury: my own six-feet two-and-a-half inches height as
against Garnett's bandy-legged five-feet two. I once or
twice playfully referred to Garnett as my "shadow" and
the joke went down well.

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By the end of the morning the "hundreds of individual
voters" had turned out to be a small number, perhaps a
dozen including street introductions, of Garnett's personal
cronies to whom he wished to display his candidate.
None the less, the time was not wasted. Everyone knew
that the Prospective Liberal Candidate was about.


Moreover, my fellow Lancastrians are friendly people
and I found myself enjoying my first experience as a
Candidate.


"Never let 'em forget it! You're a Bury man; you're
one o' their own." Garnett continued to admonish.


I tried not to let them forget it. In my conversations I
developed a new-found enthusiasm for Bury and everything
pertaining to it, while in return, I was the Prodigal
Son come home to my native hearth; I found myself
greeted with interest, curiosity, even with enthusiasm.


The ordeal of the previous night was forgotten. At
this stage, being a prospective Parliamentary candidate
was roses, roses all the way.

The Dissolution of Parliament was announced at the
end of October. Within forty-eight hours I had left my
practice in the hands of my partners and, accompanied
by Christiane and our four-year-old Christopher, was up
in Bury—entertained in the comfortable home of my
cousins Annie and Harry Holt at Lower Walshaw on the
outskirts of the town.


The circumstances of this Election will be remembered.
The combined effect of the Peace Ballot held by the
League of Nations Union earlier in the year, and of the
crisis caused by the Italian attack on Abyssinia, had been
to bring the League of Nations right into the forefront
of British politics.

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There were three candidates in the field at Bury vying
with each other to support the League of Nations. The
National Conservative Candidate, Alan Chorlton; a lady
Socialist Candidate; and myself—a much chastened I,
who had fully realized by the time I started my campaign
that, whatever I did, I must give unswerving support to
the League of Nations. We were all of us ardent for the
League. But no one was so ardent as Alan Chorlton, the
National Conservative Candidate. In this he followed the
example of his Party leaders. Eleven million people had
signed the Peace Ballot to support the League of Nations,
and Mr. Stanley Baldwin had therefore had no doubts.
The Government must have a policy of support of the
League of Nations. It had been a simple process of
deduction.


Quite apart from his support of the League of Nations,
Alan Chorlton was a formidable opponent. Prosperous,
middle-aged, solid-looking, he was the type beloved of
the middle-class electorate in the inter-war years—and
Bury, part Manchester suburb, part manufacturing town
in its own right, loved him. Above all, he was a "business
man." Therefore when a photograph of Mr. Alan Chorlton—a
handsome Mr. Chorlton taken some twenty years
previously—was published in the advertisement columns
of the <i>Bury Times</i>, accompanied by the stirring caption
"ENTERPRISE: ABILITY: EXPERIENCE—AGAINST WHAT?—
(it being presumed that a doctor who had merely wasted
his time attending to the ills of his fellow-men possessed
none of these things)—the effect throughout Bury was
electric. In addition to which, Bury had been returning a
Conservative member for seventeen years ever since the
election of 1918.


However, Alan Chorlton had come in at the last moment
to replace another candidate whose campaign had
languished. In the meantime it had been "the female of
the species" who had been making the running. This was

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

(5)


I found the Election campaign a hard row.


It was the appalling orderliness and dullness of my
meetings that put me off more than anything else.


"Would anyone like to ask the candidate any questions?"


The final meeting of the evening at the Methodist
Schoolroom in the outlying hamlet of Warth Fold had
just come to an end.


No, there were no questions. The faces of the audience
remained as they had been during the meeting—stolid,
like so many lumps of wood.


The Chairman, one of the fourteen Liberal Town
Councillors, gabbled off the formal Resolution.


"This Meeting—gabble, gabble, gabble—and pledges
itself to support him at the Poll. I declare this meeting
closed."


The audience filed out silently, leaving the Chairman,
Robert Garnett and myself in possession of the room.


"You're doing champion, Doctor Donald," beamed
Garnett. "Nigh on twenty people come to listen to you

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But I was not so happy about it as that. Garnett had
touched the spot. "Not a bit of opposition." That was
the trouble! To-night I had talked to three meetings in
succession on the all-important subject of "The Liberty
of the Individual." They had been erudite speeches in
the preparation of which I had spent hours of valuable
time. Yet the electors of Bury had remained swinishly
unresponsive to the pearls of intellectual effort that had
been displayed in front of them. And it had been the
same on previous evenings. By dint of immense mental
application I had produced speeches on different subjects
for each night's series of meetings. By telling them all I
knew—after the manner of an examinee of the Chinese
Imperial Regime—I had felt that I could not fail to
impress the electorate. It had been disappointing when
I did not seem to have succeeded. If only someone had
heaved a half-brick or a rotten tomato, or tried to heckle,
it would have relieved the tension. But even this did not
happen. I could never have imagined that election meetings
could have been so dull.


"I'll be wanting you to come back to th' Committee
Room, Doctor Donald," said Garnett as we left the
meeting hall.


My heart sank. I felt dead weary. I had already spent
most of my day in the Committee Room at the Trevelyan
Club with Garnett, and the past several days also.
During this time the resources of our joint intellects had
been devoted to the discovering of the best means of
demonstrating my eagerness to support the League of
Nations and my enthusiasm, as a Bury man, for the
welfare of my native town and the numerous sectional
interests that it contained.

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I longed to escape from this bondage. But Garnett
was insistent and I had no choice but to drive back with
him to the Trevelyan Club and to trail wearily upstairs
to the dingy sanctum with the dirty green baize-covered
card-table.


"I'll be wanting you to answer these to-morrow,
Doctor Donald," said Robert Garnett, picking up from
the table a large pile of papers, and brandishing them in
front of me. "Questionnaires, all on 'em. Every one of
'em in by th' evening post."


I groaned inwardly. It was no easy matter to try and
please everybody in Bury. It seemed, in fact, that the
whole electorate, in its various religious, business, social
capacities wished to know several times over, "In event
of your being elected will you pledge yourself to support
(or oppose, as the case might be) ——-" this, that or the
other interest which they had at heart.


But to Garnett the questionnaires were irresistible.
Weary though he was himself, he could not keep from
fingering the papers lovingly and looking over their
contents.


"Here's t' Bury Ramblers Club." He picked the top
one off the file. Then he paused a minute and scratched
his bald pate—as keeper of his candidate's conscience, he
took his duties seriously. "Yes, you can answer ‘Yes’ to
all these questions, Doctor Donald. It's important to
satisfy these folks. They've got hundreds—thousands,
I should say—of votes in t' town. Then you can
answer ‘Yes’ to this too. It's from t' Cyclists' Touring
Club."


But my only wish was to be elsewhere—back in my
warm bed in my cousin's home at Lower Walshaw.
Questionnaires had come in by the dozen during the past
few days, and I was fed up with them. The Bury Ramblers'
Club and the Cyclists' Touring Club, who had no opposite
numbers in the contest, were reasonably easy. But it was

"Oh, aye, I forgot to tell you, Doctor Donald," replied
Garnett. "T' Secretary o' t' League o' Temperance called
to see you again this afternoon just after you'd gone,
and he's calling again at half past twelve to-morrow.
I expect you'll be wanting to be out by then." And lay
preacher of the Methodist Church and teetotaller though
he was, Garnett gave a knowing wink. I had been
successfully avoiding the Secretary of the League of
Temperance, a very persistent gentleman, for several
days.


"Now, come along. Here's t' Road Haulage Association.
What are we going to answer them?" Garnett had
picked out yet another from the pile.


It was well after eleven when Garnett finished the
questionnaires. Then, having made a neat file of the
affirmative replies and having thrown the three latest
missives from the Lord's Day Observance Society (a
very persistent body too!) into the waste-paper basket,
he opened the engagement book.


"Let me see. You've got t' League o' Nations Union
coming to see you at eleven to-morrow morning. You'll
have to think on what you're going to say to them between
now and then, so as we shall get t' Peace Vote. Then after
that we'll have time to go round to t' Deanery to see Dean
Keegan, and you'll tell him you'll do everything you can
for t' Catholic Schools so as we'll get t' Catholic Vote
for certain. Then in th' afternoon we'll go round and
meet hundreds of individual voters...."

Robert Garnett continued to talk in this way of the
lovely day that was to be to-morrow, but long before he
had finished my head was starting to nod.

As, next morning, Garnett and I walked down Silver
Street to the Presbytery behind St. Marie's Church, I was
still feeling depressed and worried. The nervous strain
of trying to satisfy everybody was beginning to get me
down. Not only were there the League of Nations Union,
the Roman Catholics, the Lord's Day Observance
Society, the League of Temperance, the Bury Ramblers'
Club and so on, but also as the election progressed my
own supporters of the Bury Liberal Association had
shown that they did not intend to leave me alone. "I
thy God am a jealous God." Round every corner, so it
seemed, in these recent days, there had lurked a Firm-Stand-for-Peacer
or a Was-I-Sound-on-Free-Trader,
mindful of my political and economic conscience, waiting
to waylay me. I had become so jumpy that I hardly
dared go out in the daytime. Except for a visit to my
cousin, Harry Holt's Daisyfield Mill and another,
personally conducted by Dean Keegan, to a Catholic
School, I had spent almost my entire time during the
previous three or four days shut up in the dingy Committee
Room wrestling with the questionnaires which, at
least, were only paper foes—and making up my speeches.
Only to venture out at night either to my meetings—where
again my fiercest opponents were invariably those
who were nominally my own supporters. (Why had I
supported Mr. Randolph Churchill at Wavertree?) Or to
find the sanctuary of a Liberal Club, where, on one
desperate occasion, in a burst of reaction from my

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"How do you think we're getting on?" I asked Robert
Garnett, as I had asked him several times previously
during recent days.


"You're doing champion, Doctor Donald. Champion!
Don't you worry yourself. A Bury man for Bury, that's
candidate as they'll vote for. Anyway, here's t' Deanery
and mind what you've got to say to Dean Keegan."


An atmosphere of Hibernian joviality that contrasted
pleasantly with the somewhat severe interview that had
taken place earlier in the morning with the Bury Branch
of the League of Nations Union, pervaded the well-furnished
sitting room of St. Marie's Presbytery.


"Sure now, Doctor, won't you be joining me in a glass
of port?" Dean Keegan's bearded face and twinkling
eyes beamed a welcome.


The glass of port took away the frozen feeling that had
been an integral part of me for the past hour ever since
the League of Nations Union had filed out of my Committee
Room. I felt a sense of relaxation from the rigours
of the election campaign as the Dean talked affably of the
happy affinity of former times of the Liberal Party with
the Irish Nationalists, only by imperceptible degrees
steering the conversation on to a series of complicated
equations and percentages connected with the liability
for repairs of the buildings of the Catholic Schools.


"Yes," chimed in Garnett, "Doctor Donald has said as
he'd do everything he possibly could for t' Schools."


So we went on to talk of this and that. The one thing
that I have no recollection of being discussed was the
questionnaire that had arrived by the previous morning's
post addressed from the Presbytery, "Will you, in the
event of being elected...."

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was this questionnaire, however, which was the
subject of the following dramatic pronouncement by Dr.
Edith Summerskill:


"There was one moment when I was offered five
thousand votes in one hand and a pen in the other if I
would say ‘Yes’ and I said ‘No’. If I had said ‘Yes’ I
would have lost my immortal soul."


The five thousand votes Dr. Summerskill referred to
were those of the Catholic population of Bury over the
age of 21—what my mentor Robert Garnett had somewhat
loosely termed "the Catholic vote," reputed to be an
organised entity, the destiny of which was the subject of
much fascinating speculation at election time in Bury.
And the questionnaire was in the form of a pledge to
oppose any legislation that would help to promote (<i>a</i>)
birth control and (<i>b</i>) euthanasia.


Anyway, no mention of either birth control or euthanasia
came into my interview with the genial Dean. As we
prattled on over our port for some three-quarters of an
hour, I felt happier, more elated, than I had done since
the first occasion that Garnett and I paraded the town
together; while as we started to take our leave of the Dean
I could see that Garnett himself was hopping from one
bowed leg to the other bowed leg in the difficulty which
he found in containing the enthusiasm which had
been engendered within him.


We had barely closed the wrought-iron gates of the
Presbytery behind us than this spontaneous combustion
broke out.


"I've got to congratulate you, Doctor Donald," said
Garnett solemnly, stopping in his tracks to shake me by
the hand, "You've won th' election. He's going to give
you th' Catholic Vote. He's as good as told you that he
would."


His earnestness was such that I almost believed
him.

The succeeding days of the Election Campaign were a
time of bewilderment for me, during which I was the
victim of a sense of unreality that may well be understood
by my readers. Despite the immense mental labours of
making speeches, more and more I had the uneasy feeling
that what I said would have little relevance to the issue
of the campaign. As I grew more and more tired, anxious
and hunted during the day, sleepless at night, I began to
feel insubstantial and wraith-like, a mere <i>façade</i> for a
battle that was taking place elsewhere.


As indeed I was. For, day after day, in the November
fog, a fierce war of words, catchphrases, and innuendos
was swaying up and down the sidestreets of the town and
from doorstep to doorstep along the Council Estates—
where Dr. Edith Summerskill was no longer having it all
her own way. Other protagonists had entered the field.
There were, for instance, my own small and heroic band
of canvassers, headed gallantly by my Aunt Laura whom
a lifetime of experience in the fierce, and sometimes
vitriolic, internecine political strife of a Nova Scotian
village had equipped for just such a contest as this.
While overwhelming them, and indeed everybody else,
were the hordes of blue-beribboned ladies who advanced
like convoys of well-constructed battleships in support
of Mr. Alan Chorlton.


On such occasions as these the conversation of ladies
is, as we know, apt to take a personal turn. It may be that
invidious, though not entirely untruthful, comparisons
were made between the claims made by and on behalf of
Dr. Edith Summerskill as a medical practitioner and the
substance behind these claims as represented by her entry
in the current Medical Directory. Maybe Dr. Edith
Summerskill's dissension with the Roman Catholics was

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As Polling Day approached, signs and portents of
what was to come appeared on the poster hoardings and
in the advertising column of the <i>Bury Times</i>. The hoardings
that covered the nakedness of Bury's numerous spare
grounds shed their multi-coloured posters and broke into
a homogeneous blue rash of large letters VOTE FOR
CHORLTON. While the more maliciously-minded voters,
when asked for the favour of their vote, now pointed to
the front advertising space in the latest issue of the
<i>Bury Times</i> which shouted WHEN TWO DOCTORS DISAGREE
CHOOSE A BUSINESS MAN.


When on the morning of the Election Day itself we
did our tour of the Polling Stations, I was desperately
conscious of a difference in my reception to when I made
my first visit to the Town as prospective candidate.
Now my fellow-townfolk, as they went in to vote, had
lost their friendly welcoming air and behaved, in fact,
as if they did not want to see me. Or was I just imagining
this? Anyway I mentioned it to Garnett.


"Nay," said Garnett. "Nay, Doctor Donald. You're
tired and you're worried and you're imagining things.
You're one o' their own and they're proud o' you.
Hundreds on 'em, thousands on 'em, I should say, have
told me so. They're voting for you and no mistake."

It must have been quite 10.30 by the time that, after
driving positively the last voter to the polls across the

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I saw the scene through a haze. Mr. Alan Chorlton—
a self-satisfied looking Mr. Alan Chorlton—walking up
and down in company with a tall and exceedingly handsome
daughter; the Conservative agent; a number of our
family friends in unfamiliar guise as Conservative
supporters; then, in a separate group, Garnett and his
quorum of the fourteen Liberal Town Councillors
together with Chris, who had obviously been wondering
what had happened to me, and my Aunt Laura and
Cousin Annie and others; only the otherwise ubiquitous
Dr. Edith Summerskill was nowhere to be seen. Then,
through the haze, I was aware of Robert Garnett
approaching me.


He was a different person from the sprightly individual
of the morning. Garnett had become old and grey and
drawn.


"E-eh, Doctor Donald, it's awful," Garnett greeted me.


Garnett was right. It was awful. The Count was in its
last stages. There, on the centre table, presided over by
the Returning Officer, and neatly arranged in their
hundreds and thousands, were the voting papers, already
checked and cross-checked. Chorlton already with his
fifteen thousand or more; Summerskill, an indifferent
second, with ten thousand or so; Johnson a small pile at
the side—a mere two or three thousand. It seemed a
debacle.


"We've lost our deposit, sure enough," said Garnett
gloomily shaking his head.

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, as he spoke, another two thousand votes,
which had been overlooked, appeared from nowhere;
and we were saved the disgrace of a lost deposit. But we
were bottom of the poll by a long way.


But, for myself, I couldn't care less. As I gazed in
stuporous fashion at the pile of ballot papers on the table
in the centre of the Bury Drill Hall, my own small pile a
third the size of Alan Chorlton's and scarcely half that
of Dr. Edith Summerskill's I felt no disappointment but
only an overwhelming sense of relief. Relief that there
would be no one pestering me any longer whether or
not I was Sound on Free Trade; no one to demand was I
Firm on the Peace Question; there would be no more
questionnaires to answer; no more speeches to make up;
no more solid, unresponsive audiences to try and cajole.
I was glad it was over. I had not slept for days and nights
and I could now go to bed and sleep in peace without
anything to worry me.
