COMING OFF PSYCHIATRIC drugs, especially neuroleptics (also known as antipsychotics
and major tranquillisers), is not an issue for typical psychiatrists,
drug companies or family organisations sponsored by drug companies with
a vested interest in solving family problems with drugs. They all want to
have more, preferably life-long, drug treatment. In many US states there
have been court-decisions and law-amendments to permit permanent, often
violent, use of neuroleptics in people's communities.


On the other hand, there are more and more reports about the damage
caused by neuroleptic use. Many forms of professional action, even within
the context of health promotion, might unintentionally enhance the process
of marginalisation of recipients of neuroleptics (Lehtinen, Riikonen and
Lahtinen, 1997). According to thousands of reports, neuroleptics and other
psychiatric treatments can cause a deterioration of health. So it is no accident
that the world's biggest organisation of people who have been treatment-objects
of psychiatrists has decided to call itself, ‘European Network of (ex-)
Users and Survivors of Psychiatry’. The term ‘survivor’ refers to those who
have mainly experienced psychiatric diagnosis and treatment as a danger to
their health and life. The term ‘user’ refers to people who have mainly
experienced psychiatric diagnosis and treatment as helpful in their specific
situation. These definitions are often misunderstood: to survive psychiatry
does not mean that psychiatrists are being accused of intentionally killing
people; but it does mean that diagnoses such as schizophrenia and psychosis,
which very often have a depressing and stigmatising effect leading to
resignation and chronic hospitalisation, must be prevented. Drug-effects
such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, febrile
hyperthermia, pneumonia, asphyxia, and other dystonic or epileptic attacks,
which can pose a danger to health and sometimes cause death even after
small and single doses, have to be survived, in order for people to have a real
choice in going on taking neuroleptics or to withdraw. Kerstin Kempker, a
German survivor of psychiatry, in her book <i>Mitgift — Notizen vom
Verschwinden</i> (<i>Dowry of poison — Notes from disappearing</i>) shows the
indifference of the majority of psychiatric workers to the harm psychiatry

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048389-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Liver damage, pigmentation of inner organs, eye and brain damage,
chromosome damage, receptor-changes, modification of the personality and
‘broken-wing’ syndrome are other possible dangerous effects of
psychopharmacological treatment. Increased incidence of breast cancer
caused by drug-connected increases in the level of the sexual hormone
prolactin is discussed in the American Journal of Psychiatry (Halbreich,
Shen and Panaro, 1996). But who cares? All these damaging effects are
caused by all sorts of neuroleptics; very potent ones, less potent ones, the
older typical ones and the newer atypical ones. Differences of damage-causing
potential are secondary, for example the most common damage from typical
neuroleptics like haloperidol arises from changing the dopamine-D<sub>2</sub>-
metabolism, observable as movement-disorders; the most common damage
from atypical neuroleptics like clozapine is a change in the metabolism of
special subtypes of dopamine-receptors, dopamine-D<sub>1</sub> and -D<sub>4</sub>, seen as
producing or increasing psychotic syndromes of organic origin medium and
long-term (Chouinard and Jones, 1980; 1982; Ungerstedt and Ljungberg,
1977). Surveys of medical literature on the withdrawal problems of
neuroleptics can be found in <i>Wie Chemie und Strom auf Geist und Psyche
wirken</i> (<i>The effects of chemistry and electricity on the human mind and psyche</i>:
Lehmann, 1996a, pp. 99ff.) and <i>Wie Psychopharmaka den Koerper veraendem</i>
(<i>How psychotropic drugs change the body</i>: Lehmann, 1996b, pp. 405ff.). There
are many good reasons to decide to come off neuroleptics.


<b>Withdrawal risks of neuroleptics</b>


In the USA and Europe there are some remarkable court decisions bringing
compensation for drug-damaged people, sometimes with sums of more then
one million US$, on the grounds that there were no attempts made to help
people withdraw from the medication over many years. Lacking information
about the risk of dependency will soon no longer be a valid defence in these
cases, even if psychiatric workers deny vehemently that dependence on
neuroleptics occurs. International psychiatric journals are full of reports
about massive withdrawal problems from neuroleptics. Physical and psychic
withdrawal-symptoms may bring about — in itself unnecessary — continued
psychopharmacological treatment (Lehmann, 1996b). The most obvious way
to prevent tardive dyskinesia is to limit the use of neuroleptics (Jenner and
Marsden, 1983).


The silence concerning withdrawal-symptoms, rebound-effects,
supersensitivity-effects, receptor-changes, and tardive psychoses has fatal
consequences for users of psychiatry. They cannot act in an appropriate way
because they eventually misjudge the problems. Even psychiatric workers
have the same difficulties; in withdrawal-studies there is no distinction
between true relapse and withdrawal problems (Gilbert, Harris, McAdams
and Jeste 1995; Woggon, 1979). There is a lack of scientific rigour, a problem
frequently replicated within psychiatric practice. There are, however, many
positive experiences of self-determined withdrawal; developing a system to
support self-determined withdrawal would enhance the prospects of (ex-)

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048389-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Withdrawal symptoms are diseases or problems that were never
experienced before treatment with psychoactive drugs or not to such an
extent. Knowing exactly what to expect during withdrawal from neuroleptics
should enable the person and those who are helping him/her to assess
problems realistically and to react appropriately, in order to bring the
withdrawal process to a positive outcome. In addition to the usual withdrawal
symptoms, another problem often arises: temporary rebound symptoms
(sometimes more intense reappearance of the original symptoms present
before treatment). The appearance of these somewhat mirror-like rebound
symptoms makes it particularly difficult to see the difference between the
withdrawal symptoms and the original problems. It should be taken into
consideration (as it should be before starting such a treatment) when coming
off neuroleptic drugs that hypersensitivity (delirium, withdrawal-related
psychoses) is a serious risk. Sleeplessness, mental disturbance, symptoms
of the central nervous system, muscular and motor disturbances and
troublesome and even lethal disorders of the autonomous nervous system
have to be taken into account, leading medical professionals to recommend
gradual withdrawal.


There is a significant risk of developing tolerance and becoming dependent
on (minor) tranquillisers even after a short period of treatment with a low
dose. Severance from tranquillisers can be a dangerous matter with rebound
phenomena and powerful, sometimes life-threatening withdrawal symptoms
such as convulsions. Other risks are long ongoing depression and suicidal
tendencies, anxiety, delirium, and psychoses, which can lead to the risk of
continuous or repeated psychiatric drug treatment using progressively stronger
and more harmful substances. Withdrawal from neuroleptics (major
tranquillisers) is not basically different from withdrawal from other psychoactive
drugs, but in addition to the usual withdrawal symptoms (agitation, anxiety,
confusion, headaches, lack of concentration, eating and sleeping disorders,
increased heartbeat rate, fainting, vomiting, diarrhoea, and sweating) rebound-and
hypersensitivity-symptoms can become a problem. This is particularly
true for the relatively recent, atypical neuroleptics such as clozapine (Leponex),
olanzapine (Zyprexa), remoxipride (Roxiam), risperidone (Risperidal, Rispolin),
sertindole (Serdolect), and zotepine (Nipolept).


R. Ekblom of Ullerak Hospital in Uppsala, Sweden, and his colleagues
are the authors of a report on supersensitivity psychoses discernible
immediately after withdrawal from clozapine. They state that normal relapses
are highly unlikely to immediately follow withdrawal. They relate the case of
a 23 year-old man who, after being observed to be ‘emotionally withdrawn
and subject to olfactory hallucinations’ was given haloperidol and other
neuroleptic drugs. Due to unbearable motor and muscular disturbances
which can be the effects of these drugs, they changed to clozapine. 22 months
later he developed a dangerous alteration in his blood; the neuroleptic had
to be stopped immediately. The psychiatrists recount:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Twenty-four hours later his clinical picture changed dramatically. He
became tense and restless with intensive auditory hallucinations, hearing</i>

<i>voices which ordered him to crawl on the floor and to hit people. He also
exhibited persecutory ideas and ambivalence. During his psychotic
experiences he was well aware of the fact that he was ill. Thioridazine
was given</i> (commercially best known as Mellaril and Melleril, P.L.) <i>in
doses of up to 600 mg/day, but his symptoms only gradually diminished
and did not disappear</i>. (Ekblom, Eriksson and Lindstroem, 1984, p.
293)
</blockquote>

Rudolf Degkwitz, former President of the German Association for
Psychiatry and Neurology, has repeatedly reported on withdrawal symptoms
— not publicly, but in specialised journals:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>We now know that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for many of
the chronic patients to stop neuroleptics because of the unbearable
withdrawal-symptoms</i>. (Degkwitz and Luxenburger, 1965, p. 175
[Translation by P.L.])
</p>
</blockquote>
George Brooks, psychiatrist at the Waterbury Centre, Vermont, says:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>The severity of the withdrawal symptoms may mislead the clinician into
thinking that he is observing a relapse of the patient's mental condition</i>.
(Brooks, 1959, p. 932)
</p>
</blockquote>

<b>How to come off neuroleptics</b>


Desire, will-power and patience are of extreme importance in coming off
psychoactive drugs. The rule of thumb is: do not overdo it, be aware that
quick changes in the body's metabolism can cause severe withdrawal
symptoms.


We should also be aware that persons coming off psychiatric drugs are
weakened, particularly when they have just gone through withdrawal. Even
if they are symptom-free, their nervous system is not yet stabilised. Only a
person who is completely cured can take on new tasks.


A magic recipe for coming off psychoactive drugs does not exist. It might
be that they must be reduced gradually and, if necessary, under medical
supervision. Since it is very unusual to come off neuroleptic drugs in a
sheltered ward, there are many alternative factors of great importance: contact
persons, integration into self-help groups, social relations, access to less
harmful substances to help calm severe symptoms (Ochsenknecht, 1993)
as well as a disillusioned view of psychiatry. No matter what the conditions
of one's life at the time of severance from psychiatric drugs, it is vital to
persevere and to gradually pull oneself out of the mire. Others can only
support. The decision to live a life free of mind-invading substances must
ultimately be the patient's.


A series of articles by people who have freed themselves from dependency
on neuroleptics and very often additional antidepressants, lithium,
carbamazepine and (minor) tranquillisers as well as by those who helped

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048389-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is no patent recipe for excluding problems when coming off or
withdrawing psychiatric drugs: the uniqueness of individuals, their problems
and their possibilities mitigate against any hope of a generalised approach.
The survey of factors described by survivors as being essential for successfully
withdrawing illustrates the diversity of strategies and needs
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_14701');">[note]</a><div id="_note_14701" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1 References to individual experiences of withdrawal are taken from Lehmann, P.
(ed.) (1998a) <i>Psychopharmaka absetzen — Erfolgreiches Absetzen von
Neuroleptika, Antidepressiva, Lithium, Carbamazepin und Tranquilizern</i>. Berlin:
Antipsychiatrieverlag. English translation due 2002.</div>
.


If any problems are looming, the reduction of doses by degrees is the
best way to decrease withdrawal risks. This is especially important if a
psychiatric drug has been taken for more than one or two months. Optimally,
all the necessary factors for successful withdrawal would be present
simultaneously: a responsible attitude, a paced of coming off which matches
the dose and duration of drug treatment, supportive environments,
appropriate assistance, qualified specialists and a supporting self-help group.


But as a rule you can assume that the circumstances while coming off
are the opposite of optimal. In the worst cases there is no other possibility
than to help oneself get out of the jungle of psychopharmacologic addiction.
Ulrich Lindner, a retired theologian, philologist and historian living in the
Black Forest, and attempting to withdraw, has been taught how by his brother
who has experiences of withdrawal. Gerda W.-Z., writer, translator and
publisher of poems and short stories and also living in the Black Forest,
encourages:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>We are on our own, called upon to live in a responsible way. We are not
only sentenced by others, muzzled by others. We always have more
forces (and self-helping forces, too) available than we might have thought
in dark days</i>. (Lehmann, 1998a)
</p>
</blockquote>
Some argue that as a condition for success it is important to see through the
incompetence and the low probability of effective help from medics prescribing
psychiatric drugs, to give up illusions about their help and to separate oneself
from the doctor or psychiatrist as well as from an understanding of life-problems
as illness. ‘I gave away 21 valuable years of my life and hoped in
vain for an improvement or a cure’, says the German Bert Goelner, who
worked as a type-setter for many years, now in early retirement (disabled);
he is also founder of a self-help group for people with compulsive difficulties.


<i>We are on our own, called upon to live in a responsible way. We are not
only sentenced by others, muzzled by others. We always have more
forces (and self-helping forces, too) available than we might have thought
in dark days</i>. (Lehmann, 1998a)

To make coming off successful in the long term, it is essential to refuse
to adapt to unpleasant situations; this can mean leaving a burdensome
environment as well as quitting an unsuitable relationship. Getting crazy is
a sign showing the necessity of a change, says Maths Jesperson, board-member
of the Swedish organisation of (ex-)users and survivors of psychiatry
and researcher at the University of Lund (faculty of theatre-science): ‘Madness
is no illness to be cured. My madness came to call in a new life for me’
(Lehmann, 1998a).


Those who learn to take feelings seriously, to follow their instincts and
to take notice of and to react to warning signals of a developing crisis escape
the danger of psychiatric drugs being prescribed for a second time. Thus
developing a calm response to burdensome circumstances in life, patience,
courage and determination and the understanding that harm and hurt are
inherent to life was helpful for some survivors. Now they admit their mistakes
and accept relapses without despairing immediately. So Tara-Rosemarie
Reuter, born in the Federal Republic of Germany and having experienced a
bipolar perception of herself and the world when she was 40 years old, writes:
‘Relapses are needed to refine the instrumentarium. How should we learn if
not that way?’(Lehmann, 1998a).


These people have learned to live through fearful situations and to reduce
deep-seated anxieties. Wilma Boevink, working as a researcher at the
Department of Care and Rehabilitation at the Trimbos-Institute in Utrecht,
The Netherlands, reports:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>During the years I developed the courage to face what I tried to cover
with all my dependencies. I fought the monsters of my past, and to be
able to do this, first I had to admit them and look into their eyes. (...) You
have to find the courage to confess to yourself how things went so far</i>.
(Lehmann, 1998a)
</p>
</blockquote>
The sooner (ex-)users and survivors of psychiatry developed an understanding
of the connection between violence or abuse and their difficulties, understood
mad and troubling symptoms and reacted in alternative ways to crises, the
easier it was for them to break off emotional involvement from life problems
and deal with them. The hunt that is started after the end of an acute phase
— madness or depression — has a preventive character, as the German
Regina Bellion, former cleaning-woman, factory-worker, haute-couture sales-woman,
teacher, waitress, now living in early retirement, says: ‘Who gets
down to understanding her psychotic experiences afterwards obviously does
not run into the next psychotic phase that soon.’ (Lehmann, 1998a)


<i>During the years I developed the courage to face what I tried to cover
with all my dependencies. I fought the monsters of my past, and to be
able to do this, first I had to admit them and look into their eyes. (...) You
have to find the courage to confess to yourself how things went so far</i>.
(Lehmann, 1998a)


Some people regard it as a fundamental condition to notice their own
(co-)responsibility for their lives, their problem-burdened past and their
responsibility for their future (see, for example, Coleman, 1999). Carola Bock,
in the former German Democratic Republic working as an industrial
accountant, in early retirement since 1991, says self-critically:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Today I know that I am partly to blame for the states of crisis because I
acted wrong and was no angel at all. I often tried to solve my problems in</i>
</p><p>[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048389-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
<i>heavy-handed way, and I had not collected enough experience of life
either</i>. (Lehmann, 1998a)
</blockquote>

<i>Today I know that I am partly to blame for the states of crisis because I
acted wrong and was no angel at all. I often tried to solve my problems in</i>

As long as they make an open non-invasive interchange of personal
problems possible, self-help groups are as useful as friendships. Moreover,
self-help groups build the scope for mutual advice and for the spread of
information about possible damage caused by psychiatric drugs and problems
with coming off: ‘Most important were the conversations with (ex-)users and
survivors of psychiatry who had comparable experiences and a similar attitude
towards the world’, reports Nada Rath, co-founder of the German national
organisation of (ex-)users and survivors of psychiatry. For the English woman
Una Parker, retired school teacher and member of Mindlink and ECT
Anonymous, co-counselling meant the end of the danger of psychiatric drugs
and electroshocks:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>It has made a very great difference to me, and I think that the support I
have had from regular co-counselling sessions not only kept me out of
the psychiatric system but also helped me be much more effective in my
life</i>. (Lehmann, 1998a)
</p>
</blockquote>
Homeopathic decontamination, alleviation of withdrawal problems with
naturopathic remedies (e.g. Saint John's wort, valerian), body— and
psychotherapy, conversations in groups, sports, meditation, praying,
shamanic practices and much more can additionally help with reducing
problems of coming off and withdrawing.


<i>It has made a very great difference to me, and I think that the support I
have had from regular co-counselling sessions not only kept me out of
the psychiatric system but also helped me be much more effective in my
life</i>. (Lehmann, 1998a)


The importance of a non-discriminating relationship between a person
who wants to come off and a professional helper is underlined by Erwin
Redig, who spent several years in psychiatry in Belgium and died in 1999
after a forced commitment to a psychiatric hospital:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>This support will not come from the people that declared you ill. This
support must be sought amongst people that look upon you with other
eyes, that have honest appreciation and true interest</i>. (Lehmann, 1998a)
</p>
</blockquote>
Professional helpers note their human presence and their availability in the
critical moments of coming off as a prerequisite for effective support. But the
(ex-)users and survivors of psychiatry have to do their share in overcoming
the problems that can appear when coming off, too. Constanze Meyer,
psychologist and psychotherapist, working in private practice as well as a
counsellor in a women's centre for substance abuse in Berlin, knows that
this is not always easy:


<i>This support will not come from the people that declared you ill. This
support must be sought amongst people that look upon you with other
eyes, that have honest appreciation and true interest</i>. (Lehmann, 1998a)

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048389-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>These solutions all normally need much time and an active confrontation
with the person's own situation, attitudes and patterns of behaviour</i>.
(Lehmann, 1998a)


Anxieties should be relativised (and in that way reduced) by accurate
specialist information about risks of psychiatric drugs and coming off them.
It is not very surprising that practices used during the withdrawal process,
like acupuncture, are often highly regarded in reports of people who have
experiences with psychiatric drugs. Other measures, for example a complete
change of diet or a considered use of other drugs, are, because of the frequent
problems with getting on well without psychiatric drugs, also worth trying
by people who want to come off.


When the body is finally free of psychoactive substances and the system
is cleansed, former vitality probably will return. The belief that their stay in
psychiatric treatment was just an unfortunate incident which is best forgotten,
causes many to push away the thoughts, feelings and behaviours that got
them into treatment in the first place.


This can be dangerous. People who were forced into psychiatric treatment
should ask themselves how they can change their lives so that the
psychosocial problems that led to their psychiatrisation can be diminished.


People who ask their doctors for psychoactive drugs should first ask
themselves whether their needs — perhaps a need for peace, relief, attention,
understanding, acknowledgement — could not be better taken care of without
exposing their body to these risky and dangerous chemicals.


<b>Alternatives and measures to encourage withdrawal</b>


Karl Bach Jensen, the former chair of the European Network of (ex-)Users
and Survivors of Psychiatry, developed responsible political demands to
enhance the situation of people who made the decision to withdraw from
neuroleptics:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>To disagree with the conventional concept of mental illness and the need
for synthetic psychoactive drugs — especially when prescribed for long
term daily use or even for life — doesn't mean to close your eyes or to
deny the real problems many people experience</i>. (Jensen, 1998, p. 343)
</p>
</blockquote>
Jensen's point is not that the society shouldn't care at all or that people
should be locked up and left alone when they go crazy or out of their mind.
A fundamental characteristic of alternative mental health services, he
continues, would be to help people to cope with their problems by use of
mutual learning processes, advocacy, alternative medicine, proper nutrition,
natural healing, spiritual practice, etc. For example, alternative pharmacy


<i>To disagree with the conventional concept of mental illness and the need
for synthetic psychoactive drugs — especially when prescribed for long
term daily use or even for life — doesn't mean to close your eyes or to
deny the real problems many people experience</i>. (Jensen, 1998, p. 343)

In this field, (ex-)users and survivors of psychiatry could play an important
role as staff members and consultants, having the knowledge of what helped
them. Such services linked with a positive subcultural identity and dignity could
be provided by the public or with public financial support by the (ex-)user/
survivor-movement itself giving people the space to meet and create their
own lives (see Lindow, 1999). If people are locked up to save their life or to
prevent them from doing serious damage to others, nobody should have the
right to force upon them any kind of treatment. As a defence against
involuntary treatment, Psychiatric Wills or advanced directives — with
instructions about the kind of treatment a person wants or doesn't want if it
comes to involuntary commitment — should be legally adopted by all states
and nations. Alternative systems and decentralised services to meet the needs
of people experiencing mental health problems would minimise and in the
long run make use of synthetic and toxic psychiatric drugs needless. Until
the final abolition of these drugs, a lot of people need help and support to
withdraw from them.


An integrated part of building a future ecologically-and humanistically-oriented
social system would be the renunciation of toxic substances in
nature, the environment, the food chain and in medicine. The renunciation
of the deployment of chemical toxins in the psychosocial field could be
developed under the following aspects: (Ex-)users and survivors of psychiatry
should raise awareness in the public, amongst professionals and consumers,
about the inhuman, dangerous and negative cost-benefit outcome of long-term
administration of synthetic psychiatric drugs. So (ex-)users and survivors
of psychiatry should:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• oppose and fight international recommendations and national laws
legitimising forced psychiatric treatment, especially legally-enforced
conditions of long-term treatment in the outpatient sector,
</p>
</td></tr>

<p>
• collect and promulgate knowledge about withdrawal problems and how
to solve them,

and long-term help and support not depending on the use of synthetic
psychiatric drugs at all.

Services mentioned by Jensen are included in the aims of the European
Network of (ex-)Users and Survivors (Lehmann, 1998b; Lehmann, 1999).
One of these new services is the Berlin Runaway-House, an antipsychiatric
project with a long history (Wehde, 1992; Hoelling 1999), whose staff reflect
on the risks of psychiatric drugs. This antipsychiatric institution can provide
a good shelter to withdraw from neuroleptics too, says Kerstin Kempker,
member of the staff of the Berlin runaway-house (see her book <i>Flucht in die</i>
