<b><i>The Questions That Haunted Us</i></b>


DIANE ACKERMAN, in her Book <i>A Natural History of the Senses</i>, emphasizes
the importance of the senses for ego development when she
asserts that it is by being touched that a newborn first learns the "difference
between <i>I</i> and <i>other</i>." When Cliff and I were working with
Walker, certain questions haunted us--what are we neurologically,
psychologically, existentially, without clear sensations? What do those
individuals with confused and dysfunctioning senses have of memories?
How do people with unclear sensations store their memories?
What kinds of bonds can be forged in the chaos of sensory confusion?


If Freud was correct, if the first templates by which we pattern
love are born of our intimate moments with mother, what kind of
future lies in store for a baby lost in sensory chaos or inconsistency,
unable to forge a firm template for loving, for accepting love, for producing
love? I read that the famous autistic engineer, Temple
Grandin, claimed that she didn't "get" <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. The baby
with sensory processing disorder finds himself stuck in a world we
can only imagine. What is that world? A primordial state? Or perhaps
something worse--a kind of non-being where memory, meaning, a
sense of spatial relations, and human interaction don't begin to happen,
or happen haphazardly? I have heard stories of neurological
patients who lose their sense of their bodies; they live as if they were
ghosts, never have a sense of where they are in space. But what if such
a disorientation were translated into the psychological realm as well
as the physical? For individuals with autism, somehow the pain of the
senses, the pain of distorted senses, seems to be the primary concern.

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In both Temple Grandin's and Donna Williams's biographies about
life lived with sensory integration dysfunction and autism, they speak
often and compellingly about the life of the senses. In their worlds,
there is a kind of hegemony of the senses--the life of the senses <i>is</i> life.
And yet the senses can also be scrambled for a person with sensory
processing disorder, scrambled as if he or she were on an LSD trip, so
that some individuals have spoken of the distortions of synaesthesia, a
disorder in which one sense seems to be experienced through another:
one hears color, for instance, or sees music. I often wondered if
Walker was experiencing synaesthesia, or some altered perceptual
wash of sensation.


Temple Grandin talks in her book <i>Thinking in Pictures</i> about the
strange sensory disorientation experienced by Donna Williams:
"Fluorescent lighting in a kitchen with yellow walls blinded her.
There were also situations in which things disappeared and lost their
meaning. Donna described moving quickly through a hall:
'Perceptually the hall did not exist. I saw shapes and colors as it
whooshed by' When her visual system became completely overloaded
with stimuli, all meaning in visual sensation was lost."
Meaning was not just lost for Donna Williams on a perceptual plane.
She explains in her book <i>Nobody Nowhere</i> that she was deeply crippled
in her abilities to relate to others as a child; she spent her early
years in a bizarre and solitary world, punctuated by incomplete or
aborted relations.


I watched Walker sleeping at night, or as he stared away, and wondered
how he felt.


One day Arlene brought me a handout describing an "experience"
that some parents of grade-school age children with sensory integration
dysfunction are invited to take part in, a kind of staged performance-art
experience inviting them to literally enter their child's confused world.
The brochure described the experience something like this:
<blockquote>
<p>
The therapist invites you to imagine yourself a student. She ushers
you into a small room. Lights flash on and off; you have difficulty
finding a seat. A recording of static blasts so loudly your ears
hurt. The sound recedes, only to be replaced by the noise of children
laughing. A teacher enters and begins whispering. You can
tell that she wants you to follow directions, but the lights flash on
</p><p>[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
and off and you can't see her well. She is moving toward you. A
shrill scratching sound blasts so deadly loud you feel yourself
wanting to curl up. You try to listen to the teacher approaching,
but now you're focusing on the pain in your ears. A light bores
from behind her head. You close your eyes and curl up. "Look at
me, damn it," she yells. She sends you to the principal's office for
impertinence.
</blockquote>

The process of fully fathoming what sensory processing is about--
the ways that our senses inform our personalities and our experience
--took me months, years to understand, and of course, I'm not
finished.


When I began working with Arlene, I quickly learned that there
exist far more than five senses. Vision, hearing, touch, taste and smell:
These are the obvious senses. Yet while Arlene slowly moved Walker
through the air or held him firmly in her hands, she began to delineate
for me the myriad realms of other, more mysterious senses, the
ones not often spoken about. There is the felt knowledge of one's
own internal organs, of one's limbs, a sense of time passing, gravitational
security or insecurity (the sense of how one relates to gravity).
Arlene taught me about the <i>proprioceptive</i> sense (the sense of where
one is in space), that within this sense there exist myriad abilities,
strengths, deficits.


<i>If we close our eyes, do we know where our hands lie or move? Our kidneys?
Our toes? Some individuals don't. I have often wondered what a profound
proprioceptive deficit feels like--a kind of swimming, a floating world,
where the self evades itself, like water through a sieve</i>.


Within the proprioceptive sense there exists a sense of one's relationship
to moving bodies--the particular sense of one body's relationship
to another body in space. Thus, the proprioceptive sense determines,
in some sense, the negotiation of relationships as well. Arlene
explained that Walker was spending so much time trying to figure out
where he was--a sense that comes to us through the joints and muscles
--that he couldn't quite know where <i>we</i> were.


I learned about the <i>vestibular</i> sense (the sense of one's body in
motion or in a vehicle in motion) and, within this sense, a plethora of
fine distinctions regarding directions and types of movement to which

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Over time we began using a laundry basket to pull him around the
house, to acclimate him to unusual and unexpected movements.


It was hard to understand exactly why Walker behaved in many ways
as if he were blind. The pediatrician at our HMO who examined
Walker suggested he be tested for blindness.


"But how can you measure that?" Cliff asked.


"The eye shows an eye doctor how it can focus, regardless of what
a baby can express," he explained. "When the eye doctor asks you,
'Can you see this better or that better?, he already knows. He's just
entertaining you by asking." The doctor laughed. Perhaps he was joking.
"We won't be requiring a response from your son."


I had always imagined that when I looked out of my eyes, I saw a view
that was standard--perhaps more in focus than some who required
glasses, since I don't wear glasses, but standard. Yet what I have learned
about vision has changed that naive view. We don't all see the same
world. (For some reason, traditional eye doctors either don't acknowledge
this fact or don't care to make much of it.) According to recent
theorists in sensory processing, there is a universe of stimuli to which
we each respond differently: shapes, "directionality," spatial relationships.

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Eye doctors who can measure, and sometimes correct for, many of
these differences are called behavioral optometrists and view sight as
a neurological function, a process of perceptual interpretation. They
test for "eye tracking," "teaming" (integration of the information
coming into the two eyes),"visual focusing" (one eye's ability to focus
in tandem with the other eye), depth perception and visual perceptual
skills, which affect balance and how the body moves. We, all of us,
possess varying abilities to perceive visual information. One boy I read
about was reported by a behavioral optometrist to see twice as much
detail as the average person. The boy who saw too much had an anxiety
disorder. No wonder. Another was terrified of dogs and couldn't
catch balls until a behavioral optometrist caught what a traditional
practitioner had been unable to: that the boy's visual "teaming" was
not functioning. The first day he received corrective lenses, he caught
a ball and let a dog come straight up to him. Such stories were a revelation
to me about the connection between perception and behavior.


I struggled to understand Walker's visual sensitivity, which Arlene
made clear was profound--the worst of his sensitivities. She said he
was probably not using his eyesight much of the time.


<i>What does light have that a mother doesn't? Answer? A boy's attention</i>.


One day we asked our day-care provider to take care of Walker so we
could attend a concert in which our friend's daughter was singing a
solo. It was in an old neoclassical building on the Smith College campus.
On the southwestern wall stood huge banks of leaded windows,
thirty feet high. The afternoon sun poured into the windows, making
a glow so intense it became a haze, a headachy bright intrusion that I
tried to avoid. Yet for some reason I was drawn to the light, pulled
into it, in spite of the fact that the light was thoroughly unpleasant. Is
this some kind of instinct? I felt impressionable, unfocused, irritated.
Still I couldn't look away. In that instant. I thought I might understand

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The tactile system is another important sense in the world of sensory
dysfunction, as it is for all of us, though we may not realize it. Arlene
explained to me that she was "tactilely sensitive" herself and could
barely bring herself to help Walker eat certain foods, particularly if
they were gooey.


I came to realize that there is no touch like human touch. It is the
most stimulating, perhaps, of all sensations. "That's why it's hard for
Walker to be touched by you," she said. "The skin is an extreme
source of stimulation because it was designed to be so. It's meant to
give neurological messages." I began to suspect, by the both positive
and negative and dramatic reactions Walker had to being held or
touched, that human skin is perhaps unlike anything else in nature.
Consider his reaction to nursing. He had to force himself to do it.
Now I know it must have been a vortex--the mouth including a
major nerve, so much skin touching skin. Was satisfaction itself stimulating
to the nervous system? Certain touches organized Walker;
certain touches disorganized him. But did I quite understand which
did which?


The sense of smell, though it may be less talked about than the other
senses, is an important one. It is neurologically closely connected to
memory functions. Perhaps this is why autistic individuals, with highly
sensitized noses, are reported to have often powerful memories.


Yet a strong sense of smell, I learned, could drive an autistic person
mad with irritation. I understood this fact from having been pregnant,
as many woman do. Both times, when I was pregnant, I could
smell the butcher's department the second I walked into the supermarket,
even though it was at the far end. The smell of dead flesh was
often so overpowering I had to leave, gagging, and was often literally
sick from it. Yet even those heightened sensations seemed tame compared
to what I learned can happen in severe sensory integration disorder.
I read about one boy who could identify the smell of all
different kinds of animal manure--cow, sheep, horse, and even other

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One day in midsummer, my friend Mark sent me an e-mail explaining
that he had a friend who lived in Norway whose baby was very
ill. The infant had no sense of hunger, had received several operations,
was failing to thrive. It suddenly occurred to me that the baby in
question might be having sensory problems. Wasn't hunger a sense?
An internal regulatory function whereby the body decided how
much input one needed? It didn't take me more than another step to
wonder, for the first time, if Walker's eating problems weren't largely
sensory. Arlene expected his mouth was sensitive, and she had some
success stimulating his mouth to help him eat better, yet still we
hadn't been able to do much to stimulate appetite. Arlene felt he was
often too overwhelmed to be hungry.


Perhaps the area of greatest competence for Walker was his sense of
hearing. He was indeed sensitive to sound, yet he could also be
responsive to our sounds. He also sometimes made noises when the
radio was on, as if he might be singing. Perhaps auditory strength
explains why in the early months he seemed to be imitating us, saying
"Ah ew eh," for I love you. <i>But why had he then lost that ability?</i>


As soon as I began to understand the hidden senses, and the ones I
thought I knew about, I had to face another fact: that perhaps the
most important aspect of any sense in the nervous system may be its
relationship to another sense. Arlene blithely spoke about the mysteries
of the nervous system.


"The vestibular and auditory are housed next door to each other
in the brain. They share the same fluid. Sound gives you a sense of
space," said Arlene.


The mouth was connected to the brain and other senses in ways I
would never before have imagined.


"The mouth is where we begin in the world," Arlene said.


"Begin?"


"The mouth is the center of the body. It brings together the two
sides of the brain, organizing us around a midpoint. The mouth is

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The brain I could see as a complex system, but <i>the mouth</i>? "Have
you ever found yourself biting a pen while you were thinking?" asked
Arlene. "That's why."


If the senses formed a rich neurological matrix, the fear was that
Walker's experience might be a broken mosaic, some mesmerizing
chips of illogic or color, only vaguely reflecting the themes of reality.
The idea was to always create a full and whole, lived experience for
Walker.


The way out was synergy. Arlene and Lenore, each in their separate
languages, emphasized the same truth about the nervous system:
The senses "speak" through each other; they can "learn" from each
other. The senses can work to complement, distract, instruct, or
inform one another. I was astounded to learn that some non-speaking
children, remarkably, learn to do so first by reading, whereas
other children who can't perform the visual operation of reading,
learn to do so through touch, by feeling letters made of sandpaper.


We needed to talk while we touched Walker, to give sounds to
actions, to name feelings, to use words to render sense to gestures, to
touch, touch, touch and talk, talk, talk. Cliff and Elizabeth and I made
up songs and dances. Walker at times was beginning to watch. But
where was the point of overstimulation? What was the trigger that
sent him reeling away from us into the internal landscape? That was
always the challenge, the paradox, the danger--that the treatment
could also be the poison.


If we were going to help Walker live in our world, we would have
to enter his. So while Arlene and I studied the small creature on the
rug, I learned to be aware of the subtle annoying noises, the harsh
lights, the wound of certain textures. I tried to hear the wind outside,
the scratching of branches on the window, felt, almost viscerally, the
multipitched, high and airy, low and humming insult of traffic outside.
I began to feel the zing of the ambulance screaming, the shrill electric
whine of the saws working on our neighbor's house addition; I
alerted myself to the intrusion of the <i>crick, crick, crick</i> made by the
squeaky crumpling of a plastic bag. I hoped, if I could feel any of these
feelings before he felt them, I could pull him away, could prevent his

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My memory of Walker's first summer is distorted, skewed. It seemed
to last for years. Time was stretching, yawning. The sun was always
hanging in the sky--exalting like a kid showing off. Sometimes the
sun was so strong it seemed to be bending the windows to its will,
especially in the bedroom or the kitchen on the south sides of the
house where the blinds seemed nearly useless. Light flooded like
water through the slats. It was as if noontime seemed to be all time
that summer, though Walker and I were always hiding away from it in
the darkness like one of the creatures in children's stories that die from
light. Not until nearly nine did the sun finally give way, long past
Elizabeth's "witching hour," when she seemed to lose her nerves
somehow. Like many children her age, she sometimes lost self-control
before dinner, crying, yelling, lashing out. We were all frayed, all "sensory
defensive," overstimulated, frazzled. Still, we played with Walker
every chance we found. We played the game with the wire sphere. We
said his name. <i>Walker</i>. We held him in a tight ball. We jumped up and
down to attract his attention--we were having to work hard to keep
his attention. The electric saws droned on and on next door, but one
day I realized that Walker was able to play with me for ten minutes
without losing his concentration, even as the saws buzzed wildly.


Every day, on the floor with Walker, at the kitchen table, we tried
to put some food into him, and we tried to understand. Yet if trying
to understand Walker was difficult, trying to explain was even harder.


The Fourth of July weekend Cliff's sister, Susan, came with her
daughter to nearby Springfield to visit her parents and to see us. Susan
invited us to join the family in Springfield for a backyard picnic. Cliff
declined. Susan called me later that day. "Can't you just come for a
couple of hours?" she wanted to know. I can well imagine what she
must have been feeling, after flying up to visit. She must have thought
we were all going mad or were overprotective.


"It's hard to explain," I tried to tell her.


"I know," she said, patiently. "You said he's sensitive. But we'll just
be in the backyard. In nature. It will be very calm and peaceful. We're
not going to have loud music or fireworks."

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

How could I explain? The last thing in the world we wanted to do
was offend Cliff's kind sister and family. So we went. As we ate, Cliff
and I watched Walker.


"Look," someone said. "See, he's looking up at the trees."


But we knew that he wasn't looking at the trees at all. His gaze was
lost somewhere. As it often was. While Walker stared above us into the
white-blue space, I wondered how much time we were losing. What
had it cost him to be gone from us for two hours? For three? For four?

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>New Clues</i></b>


A WOMAN--Therese, a mother from Arcadia, Elizabeth's nursery
school--called me one day when I had been working with REACH
for about a month. She was pregnant when I was, gave birth to her
daughter, Emily, a month before Walker was born. She called because
she was concerned about us, had heard through the grapevine that
Walker was ill. It may have been one of the most important phone
calls of Walker's life, though its roots were peculiar, disturbing. Years
later, Therese confessed to me that another mother from the nursery
school had called her to talk about Walker (she won't reveal to me
who it was, and I'm grateful). The mother, however, was apparently
convinced that I wasn't feeding Walker enough. I'm still not sure why
she never asked me what I was doing, or perhaps she had, but the
answer didn't mean much to her. All she saw was a baby who looked
like a starving child from the drought land of East Africa--ribs that
pressed beyond skin and flesh, almost exoskeletal bones, arms as skinny
as a hose, distended stomach, a starved look around the eyes. I can
see how a mother would think that Walker's was the look of hunger.
And it may well have been. We knew Walker was starving to death in
a way, sliding into a shadow world. I had called the pediatrician, even
sent him an emergency fax, when days before I'd tried to tell him that
Walker was losing weight quickly (seven ounces in just a few days),
losing in spite of how much rice cereal I pressed between his dispassionate
lips.


I suppose we could be angry that someone might have thought we
weren't doing enough, but the irony is that whoever called Therese
had called the right person.

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She called Therese because she knew Therese had experience with
social services, yet what she may not have known about Therese is that
she had a lifetime's experience with allergies.


When Therese received the call, she was frightened. She knew
from having worked in the system that social services had a history of
making fatal mistakes--taking children from their homes because of
misunderstandings. She urged the other mother to resist making the
call, to talk to me, and after they hung up, she immediately called me.


When I told her I thought Walker might have allergies, she
believed me, embraced my theory. How could she not? She had lived
with allergies her entire life. Allergies had eaten her. She had a special
air filter installed in her air conditioner. She intentionally lived near
the hospital.


"Look," she said. "I'm highly allergic. I've been in anaphylaxis. I need
to get up twice a night to take inhaler for asthma. If my husband eats fish
and kisses me, my cheeks swell. I can't visit people with dogs or cats."


I told her my own story.


When I was in college in California, I moved into the most beautiful
house I had ever lived in--it was a house near the sea that had
been hand-built by the owners of the local hardware store. It was
Tudor style, with imported Italian tiles, leaded windows, arches. Yet
from the first day living there, I was ravaged with feelings of discomfort.
Tears rolled down my eyes as I sat in bed trying to read. I tore the
place apart with a vacuum cleaner, but it didn't help. Eventually I visited
an allergist who told me that I needed to get away from that
house. He suspected mold in the walls, since I showed high allergic
responses to mold on my skin tests. At that time I began reading as
much as I could about allergies. Several books insisted that severe
allergies can change your personality, can deeply affect the ability to
concentrate, to work, to attend.


Now, here was my baby, writhing, covered with eczema, barely
able to breathe, rashy after nursing. How could I not believe that
something in his environment was causing such discomfort? Yet I
didn't understand why any doctors wouldn't attend to this point. "The
pediatrician at our HMO claims babies don't really have allergies," I
told her. "Can that be true?"

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No." said Therese. Only Dr. Lasneski, the chiropractor-nutritionist
who gave us supplements, would engage with the question. He said
that Walker's eczema was decidedly an allergic response.


"After we nurse," I continued, "his cheeks are red. I want to wean
him, to fill him full of only pure ingredients. The pediatrician says
breast milk is the best. But I don't believe it. Not for this child. I see
him rolling, writhing with discomfort, and I think I know that discomfort.
Red cheeks, swollen. Tell me, Therese, do you think allergies
could be so bad they could affect brain development?" I asked.


"Oh, yes," she said, "I'm sure of it. When I have bad reactions, I
feel raw all over. If I eat the wrong things, they'll kill me, why
wouldn't they also possibly affect someone's brain?"


She vowed to research the subject on the Internet, to call me back.


She knew I was busy working with Walker.


<i>What is he allergic to that I'm eating, or is it just me and my milk?</i>


Therese and I agreed to meet in a park; we could talk while her children
played. She brought some information. On the Internet, she had
discovered that there is a phenomenon called "brain allergies." She
said the subject was controversial, she had the impression that people
concerned with how diet affects behavior were particularly interested
in the subject. She had found that the Feingold Association asserted
that diet affected the brain and that at Johns Hopkins University they
had advocated a diet called the Ketogenic diet, which seems to have
dramatically curtailed seizures in some epileptics.


"If Walker's nervous system is sensitive to natural levels of stimulation,"
I argued to Therese, "what kind of sensitivities are there in his
internal system?" What kind of havoc were the chemicals in certain
foods wreaking with Walker's sensitivities, abrading him, twisting him
inward, damaging his ability to give us his attention?


As Therese talked, I looked down and noticed that I was wearing
two different shoes, mismatched, a tennis shoe and a black leather one.
We laughed. I went home and researched some more after the children
slept.

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What was this connection between allergies and neurological dysfunction?
I felt certain they were related. I watched Walker closely. If
his system were profoundly compromised by some substance, what
might be the invader?


I had a clue several nights later when I went to a parents' meeting.
There a woman spoke of her quest for a cure for her daughter's
autism. She felt certain the problem was largely dietary. She recommended
removing wheat and dairy.


Two days later, I was talking to Therese on the phone and I decided
that for certain I would put Walker on hypoallergenic formula.
Even Vicki, REACH'S nutritionist, agreed it was a worthwhile move.
I hung up quickly, drove to the pharmacy, and bought hypoallergenic
formula. I drove fast. Cliff and I also called the doctor and insisted the
doctor try a round of antibiotics. Something must be done for
Walker's breathing.


Results came in from the X-ray of Walker's adenoids. They were
inflamed. He agreed antibiotics were in order.


<i>Is it difficult taking my baby away from the breast, Therese wants to know?
No, it isn't. It's one of the easiest things I've ever done, holding Walker in my
arms while he cries now from a hunger that must be overwhelming. We sit in
the rocker, but I barely move--not much, not too much motion. It's one of the
few things I can give him, this taking away</i>.


I shut my ears to the cries. After several hours of having no food,
he took the bottle thirstily. Therese wanted to know if it hurts me
somehow that my own milk isn't good for my baby. Why take it personally?
If machine oil was best for him, I'd buy a case.


Yet that night--his first off of breast milk--we noticed a difference.
Walker seemed to be resting for the first night of his life. Now,
a week after we had begun the supplement therapy with Dr. Lasneski,
and two days after I had weaned him, the eczema was almost gone.


The next day, we made another change.


We found a new pediatrician, Dr. Cochrane, a polite man, handsome,
sandy hair, and an old-world formality. He shook our hands
with unusually soft fingers and studied Walker. He turned from
Walker, bore his eyes into mine, looked almost frightened with the
effort of it, and said, "I certainly share your concern for your son,

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Think of the future you want</i>.


Walker was now on two brands of hypoallergenic formula made of
some milk product, though with the allergens removed. I still don't
fully understand how such a process is possible--to remove some
aspect of the milk's protein without depriving it of its usefulness, but
I always imagined it to be something like decaffeinating coffee (flyers
said the protein was "predigested"). Whatever the process was, it must
have been complex, because the formulas were expensive. Cliff and I
estimated that keeping Walker on the formulas would cost us between
$600 and $950 per month.


Cliff was growing more and more anxious about money. He began
calling me from work to say he felt we should move, that no one with
a baby like Walker could afford to live in a large 150-year-old house
in the Historic District, at least not in one that was as needy of repairs
as ours. He called me while I was supervising Walker's push-ups.


"I've called an agent. She's going to show me some houses during
lunch."


"What are you talking about?" I said.


"We've got to move, Pat."


"There is no way we're moving now. Our son needs us, needs
everything we've got to give."


"The supplements are costing us about $150 a month; Lenore
costs $80 a week, and now this formula is costing $600 a month. That's
a mortgage for some people right there, and the insurance company
won't pay for a dime of any of it."


"So we'll go in debt. We'll use credit cards."


"We already are. This is no way to live."


"You can look at all the houses you want, Cliff, but I'm not moving."
I hung up the phone.


I called our insurance company. They gave me a list of diagnoses
that would qualify us for insurance to pay for hypoallergenic formula.

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You mean insurance won't cover hypoallergenic formulas for
children with allergies?"


"No," said the woman on the other end.


I took the list and called our doctor. He called me back quickly.


"Is there something here that you can legitimately say that Walker
has?" I read a list of foreign medical terms. Colitis. Malabsorption.


"No."


"Can't you say he has this gastroesophageal reflux?"


"No," said the doctor. "It's a very specific problem."


Later, when Walker was napping, I called Darleen Corbett at REACH
and asked her if there was any way we could receive help for Walker's
expenses. She referred me to Marianne Beach with the Department
of Public Health.


Within two days, Marianne Beach was at our door, making a home
visit, customary when she took on cases.


She sat on the couch and waited while I ran upstairs to retrieve
Walker from the crib. It was about his time to wake up, and she wanted
to meet him. I stood in the doorway for a few seconds to catch my
breath. I didn't know what I'd find. Sound emanating from the room
was emptiness, a void, and I had that fear that I always had that perhaps
he had died in his sleep. I began to speak, hoping my voice
would make him stir, but when I reached the crib I saw that he was
awake already. Awake, but not awake perhaps. Walker was lying in the
crib with his head curled far upward, backward. I knew what this was
now, it was called "extension." His eyes were open, yet he seemed
somehow frozen. "Walker," I said. No reaction. "Walker!" Nothing. I
shook him a little, but he remained frozen. I'm not even sure he was
blinking. I picked him up, brought him into the correct form that
Arlene and Lenore insisted he needed to always be in, the perfect C,
curled in toward his center. He fell into my arms like a dead weight.
Head heavy, rubbery-seeming. Moving through the somewhat dimmer
light of the stairwell, I tried to bring his attention around to me.
I didn't speak but strained to make as blank and loving a face as I
could. Was it my imagination or did he seem a little more aware in the
C shape? I brought him downstairs and into the room where
Marianne sat and crossed my legs on the floor.

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Is that some special thing you're doing?" she asked.


"Yes. We're to keep him in a perfect circle or C shape."


"Really--he needs to be in a shape?"


"Yes," I said. "It encourages proper brain development."


"Really?"


"Yes."


"I've never heard of that," she said.


"I know," I agreed. "It sounds superstitious."


"Actually, I think I may have had one boy, mentally retarded,
whose parents did something like that." As she spoke, Walker grew
agitated.


Was it the new voice, or too much holding? I lay him on the floor
in the ball, making small adjustments, as my ballet teacher used to do
to me to make sure I positioned myself properly, got the curve just
right. I lay down close to him with our heads near each other.


I sighed. "Retarded people don't have problems with loving, do
they?"


She looked at me gently as if to say, "Everybody has problems with
loving, don't they?"


"It's not like with autism; was the retarded child affectionate?"


I looked down at Walker.


"So they suspect autism, do they?" said Marianne.


"Nothing official yet, but we sort of do."


"I have a lot of clients whose children have autism. One family, in
the Berkshires with triplets. All three autistic."


"Wow," was all I could say.


I lay on the floor while Marianne told me something about herself
and her brother with cancer, about her special interest in special
needs children, about some of the strange situations she encounters.


"Once I was called in on a suspected child-abuse charge," she
explained. "A doctor had examined a baby with duct tape around his
diaper. When I came to the home I immediately knew what the problem
was. The kid was a wild man. No wonder the mother needed to
use duct tape on his diaper, he was tearing at everything in sight."


"Sounds more like the baby was abusing the parents," I said. We
both laughed.


"By the way," she added, "this is backtracking, but were you ever
given a drug called terbutaline?"

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Terbutaline?"


"It's given to mothers who go into labor early."


"No," I said. "I didn't go into premature labor."


"Are you sure?"


"Yes I'm sure. Why?"


"My family in the Berkshires has been doing some research with
an autism expert in Boston. They believe the terbutaline she was given
is responsible for their children's autism. The doctor figured it this
way: Why would three fraternal--you know, non-identical--triplets
all have the same disease? How could genetics factor for that? What
were the genetic odds? It must have been something postconception
that caused the autism. The mother was given terbutaline. Seems
they've found other terbutaline women with autistic children."


"Wow."


Later in the interview, we got down to the basics. I explained to
Marianne that we needed financial assistance for Walker. She
explained that a program called Mass Health might cover a lot of
Walker's needs and might also fill in for what insurance companies
don't pay for. She looked around our house and said, "I'm not sure
you'll qualify, but perhaps I can help you in another way."


The next morning at 8:30 A.M. she came to the door. Was she
wearing a trench coat, or do I just imagine it?


"Come here," she said in a tone of conspiracy. We walked to her
car on the street; she opened the trunk and began pulling plastic bags
out of it.


"What is this?" I asked.


"Hypoallergenic formula," she said. "You said you needed some. I
know a family that doesn't need this anymore."


"Is this part of your job?"


She looked at me sideways. "Well, it's not written into my job
description or anything. In fact, don't mention it to my boss."


That night I was lying in bed, the day settling heavily, a leaded sediment,
sleep coming fast. My body was grabbing sleep, claiming it, the
sinking water pulling me, when ideas began to tumble: <i>babies in duct
tape, retarded client, triplets with autism in the Berkshires. The oddness of three.
No one child for solace....And what was this drug? Tribute? Tribune ...?</i>

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I thought back to Walker's birth.


Back to a moment, the scene in the hospital flooded my awareness.


<i>I am lying on a table, lightning entering my body: Back labor. (The famous
back labor they talked about in the labor classes with dread.) All bets were off
with that kind of labor--too much pressure on the spine; it seemed only a
masochist would try it without pain medication. They said it would move like
evil through the body, the legs, and they were right. The baby seemed to be
exploding out of my nervous system rather than the womb. Electric shock</i>.


<i>Tired, jaded doctors--one yelling at me, the other flirting with the nurse, talking
incessantly, incessantly about Steven King novels, the wicked car, the doctor's
maniacal laugh</i>.


<i>C-section was inevitable, but the doctors weren't ready ...
and the needle ...</i>


<i>"But is it safe?" I asked</i>.


<i>"Honey, it's what they give asthma patients," said the nurse</i>.


<i>"But I'm pregnant."</i>


<i>"We do it all the time, honey."</i>


I ran downstairs and went through my files for the birth records. I
found the yellow sheet with its smudgy carbon writing--the word
"terbutaline" written three times in separate places across the record.


First thing the next morning, I called a friend in the medical field.


"You'll never know why," she said. "What about your other concerns
-- the blue cold medicine, the antibiotics, genetics? And besides.
Even if you feel sure you know the reason, you'll never prove it."

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>A Walk Around the Driveway</i></b>


A WEEK AFTER WE MET with Marianne Beach, I was scheduled to
teach the morning writing intensive--every weekday for three hours.
My friend Kyle agreed to baby-sit for an impossibly low sum. I felt
ashamed asking her. I wanted to say I knew that women were often
asked or even expected to do things for reasons different than money,
and I was sorry I was relying on her affections for my son, but I didn't.
Instead, I said, "Could you possibly watch Walker for $4.00 an hour?"
She said she might be able to do it for $5.00. I knew that Kyle was
the ideal choice to spend mornings with Walker. In many ways, she
had more to give him than I. She was filled with affection, caressed his
body firmly, rubbed his little feet to warm them, and dressed him
thoughtfully, creatively, using his berets and the new socks she had
bought. She was attentive to his eating (now that he was on hypoallergenic
formula, he wasn't vomiting as much). What I wasn't fully
prepared for, however, was Kyle's attention to me.


Each morning as she waited for me to leave, Kyle watched me rush
around the house looking for last-minute items: "Where is that
<i>Reader's Encyclopedia</i> I promised to share with the students?" "Where
is the notebook I was writing in last; night?" "Where are my keys?" I
was a bit shaky, scattered. When it was time to close the door, I leaned
around it and gave a final look toward Walker. "Good-bye honey," I
said. Walker didn't often look my way.


One morning Kyle arrived with a piece of paper. She handed it to
me shyly. On it was a poem she had written to me with a veiled hint
I might want to take antidepressants.

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In anticipation of my teaching, Arlene, who had been seeing
Walker for about two months, began coming in the afternoon so she
could work with me and Walker when I would be home. Walker was
nine months old. Most babies at that age are vigorously crawling, babbling,
looking at people every moment. Giving and taking with the
world is their way of learning. They do it naturally, grabbing at life.
With Walker, it still took considerable effort to reach his attention.
One afternoon during this period, I sat above him and lifted a small
teddy bear to my eyes. He smiled and looked up. Awareness pierced
through me. I could swear that he was looking right into my eyes. We
held the gaze for a moment, and then he looked away.


I had the odd electric charge, a raw and slightly alarming sensation.


"Arlene," I said, "did you see that? He was looking into my eyes. I
could swear it. Do you think he was?"


"Yes," she said. "You know, I have an idea. Let's take him outside."


"Are you kidding? For real? I'm not sure we should. Two weeks
ago, on the Fourth of July he was outside for two or three hours and
he just stared into space."


"Let's see how he does," she said. "Just for a while. He's doing a
little bit better every time I see him."


We planned that on the following week for her next visit, we
would take a walk.


All that weekend, I looked forward to the day that Arlene would
come for our stroll with Walker. I had romantic images of Arlene and
Walker and me strolling through the park, two women and a baby,
enjoying the afternoon. It would be quaint, an old-fashioned comfort.
I was starving for stimulation myself, but it was more than that--not
so much that my senses wanted something, but more that I wanted
something for me. Teaching was helpful, and was helping, but it was
so much in a different world. A walk, a talk, two adults and a baby --
I hungered for such a life with Walker. Arlene was one of the few
adults I spoke with during the day. (Cliff and I were too busy at home
to talk to each other; he had taken on a freelance job to pay for therapies.)
Arlene's concern for me and for Walker gave me a focus, not

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When she arrived, she began to do her normal therapy but I
reminded her that we had planned an outing. She looked at her
watch. "Well, there's not much time, but we'll give it a try." I picked
up Walker and took him out to the back porch. Arlene followed.


"Where shall we go?"


"Not far," said Arlene. "There isn't much time." Walker was
squirming in my arms, arching.


"Let's put him down," she suggested. "Do you have a stroller?"


"Yes." I scrambled to pull my stroller out of the garage, where it
was kept, waiting to be useful. I placed a blanket on it, and Arlene
adjusted it so Walker could be inclined enough to see out.


Then we began to walk.


"Wait," said Arlene. She bent down near Walker's face, not too
closely, and tried to attract his attention. He looked up at her.
"Good," she said. "Now let's just take a walk around the driveway."


"Around the driveway?"


"Yes. That may be more than enough for him."


"Is that as far as we get to go?"


"It's miles for him."


I pushed the stroller. Every few feet Arlene tried to get Walker's
attention. Once around the car and Walker could still look up at us,
could still give us his attention. By the middle of the second trip,
we had lost him. He was gazing away.


The stroll had been too much for him.


We brought him into the house and tried to work with him, but
the stroller trip had overloaded his vestibular system, Arlene
explained. We would have to wait until he was calmer to work
again.


A few days later, Arlene pulled a red plastic ball out of her bag. It
was medium sized, rubbery, covered with plastic prongs that came
to a point (a fun version of those metal balls that hung from chains
in the middle ages). She handed it to Walker, who held it in his
hand, then immediately began screaming. The screams were loud,
as if he'd been pierced by pins. I snatched it out of his hand--just

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What do you think it was?" I queried Arlene.


She shook her head, shrugged. "I think it was just the ball," she
said. "It was just too much for him."


My nerves were shot, and I was trembling. The realization of
Walker's sensitivity came home to me again, this time not just as
sadness that my child might not be able to socialize, but as something
more visceral--<i>my God, a plastic ball produces hysteria?</i> What
about jungle gyms and mud in your toes, what about birthday balloons
bursting and the squeaky brakes of buses? All the sensory
challenges that face children, and here was my baby in Armageddon
at the touch of a knobby plastic ball.


Still, I convinced myself that Walker was improving. Hadn't he
made eye contact? Couldn't he push his head up now? I rode the
high curved arc of the roller coaster, thrilled with what I thought
was progress--particularly the fact that he had looked in my eyes,
until I saw Arlene the following Thursday. She had seemed so positive
the past few weeks about Walker's progress, had looked at
Walker with loving eyes. If anyone could teach my son to love, I
reasoned, it was this tall, handsome woman with brown bangs and
large eyes. I excitedly mentioned an invitation I'd received from
REACH to bring Walker to a playgroup. It was on a bulletin board
in the kitchen. I was moving toward it while we talked when I
turned and saw her standing next to me, with a sober expression.


"What's the matter?"


She held out her hand as if to stop me. "I don't think you should go."


"But I got an invitation."


"I just want to ..." She hesitated, chose her words carefully. "It's
my job to protect you. I mean, I should be protecting you, too, not
just Walker."


"What do you mean protect me?"


"There'll be other babies there ... it's just that ..."


<i>I think I understood what she meant. What she meant was that I would
compare. I would see</i>.

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Cold air into the oven--the baked goods fallen. Did she have to say it?
There had been so much compassion in her eyes. Since Walker made eye contact,
I had been hopeful he might be getting better, and now ... What is she
protecting me from? She has been so good lately at hiding her concern. Indeed,
I had begun to think she might have favored Walker among her clients</i>.


One afternoon, when Walker was asleep I had asked her if it was
difficult to work with the mothers of extremely ill children. "At
REACH," she said, "the mothers are great. And anyway, they always
seem to find someone they feel more sorry for than themselves."


<i>Now she doesn't want me to go to the meetings. Does she suspect I would
lie at the bottom of the food chain?</i>


"Listen," she said. "I've got someone at REACH who might want
to work with Walker. Her name is Dawn. She'd like to come and meet
him. When would be a good time?"


She didn't tell me exactly who Dawn was, nothing about her speciality
or background, only that Dawn was "interested in working
with Walker."


Dawn came into the house one day, about a week later, following
Arlene. I guessed she was in her late thirties, a woman with a wide,
friendly, almost shy smile, and thick strawberry blond hair. Oddly,
Walker did what he had done when he met Arlene. He began sprinting
upside down through the air with his arms and legs, his head
swinging from side to side. I remember thinking, "Oh no, now she
won't want to work with Walker," ignorantly assuming that Dawn
could choose her cases.


I spent days waiting to discover if Dawn would work with Walker.
When Arlene arrived on the following Monday, after the visit, I said,
"Does she want to?"


"Does who?"


"Dawn."


"What?"


"Want to work with Walker?"


Arlene seemed flustered. "It's not a matter of what she wants. It's a
question of what's appropriate."


"Is it appropriate?"


"Yes, I believe it is. She'll be calling you to make an appointment."

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Arlene had been avoiding the word <i>autism</i> for weeks. What Arlene
didn't quite have the heart to tell me, what I learned on Dawn's visit,
was that Dawn was an educator who had worked for fifteen years
with children with autism.


It would be years later that I would learn that she and Dawn had
returned to the office, agreeing that neither had met a baby quite like
Walker.


"Do you think," said Dawn to Arlene, "that moving his hands in
the air is the baby version of an autistic child flapping?"


I would learn only years later that Arlene had said yes.


<i>But there's something else gnawing at me, a feeling I've been here before, somehow.
I remember how I longed to reach my mother when she was listening to
her own sirens that pulled her inward. In the car, doing errands, she used to
think so intensely I fell she was trying to solve the all the problems of the world
in just one car ride. One day, when I was about four or five, I thought up a
solution to my problem: A joke--the perfect joke, just the funniest, most hilarious
joke I could think of. It worked. Suddenly Mom turned, the face coming
to life, her lovely lips opening, her eyes beaming. And she was back there with
me, all of us together, laughing at the very same joke. But there were never
enough jokes to keep Mom with me for good. Now I wondered. Perhaps working
this hard could keep my son with us for a few moments, but a few moments
didn't constitute a life. Arlene had said Walker experienced "islands of warmth
and relatedness." But what good was an island, floating in a sea of disconnectedness?</i>

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>The Epidemic</i></b>


ELIZABETH'S MONTH with my mother was over, and now that it was
mid-July, Dawn was coming. She brought props. She came, as Arlene
did, though at a different time, with a large canvas bag filled with
toys. I began to think of the contents of these bags as the stuff of
magicians: cups and balls to hide, scarves, photographs, mirrors. She
held Walker in her lap, enticed him, moved him with her eyes, her
hands, laughed and hugged him.


"Why mirrors? I said.


"So he knows himself. So he knows where I begin and where he
leaves off."


It would be Dawn's focus to work on Walker's social development;
Arlene's to work on Walker's physical development, though, of
course, their duties would overlap. (Lenore's work was close to
Arlene's, though difficult to categorize.) Dawn was formally called an
educator, though she specialized in autism. Arlene was formally a
physical therapist, though she was well versed in sensory integration.
Dawn was also to focus on Walker's cognitive relationship with the
world. At times her suggestions seemed weird or unexpected. She
encouraged me to plant as much of the unexpected into Walker's
daily habit as possible. "Take one of these little board books that he's
familiar with, for example," she said, "and paste a picture of Elizabeth
inside to surprise him. Sensitive children, and children with autism,"
she explained, "become dependent upon the familiar to be content,
because each new thing they encounter requires an adjustment to the
senses, the brain."

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>But a baby might be able to learn to grow used to the shock of the new?</i>


Dawn sometimes encouraged me to bring Elizabeth into the dining
room to play with Walker. She talked with Elizabeth and played with
her, too. Yet it was clear to all of us that Walker wasn't quite on
Elizabeth's wave length. I doubt that even if he had not been born
particularly sensitive, he might not have been like her--the girl who
wore dramatic white dresses with petticoats to preschool, the girl who
insisted on dressing as a cowgirl for picture day. When Walker napped
I spent time with Elizabeth, brushing her long hair, or we sometimes
cooked together--yet the phone was always ringing. Often when the
therapists came, I turned the TV or videos on. I began rationalizing
that Elizabeth might someday be a movie producer. She memorized
lines from movies, sang the songs from the musicals for Dawn and
Arlene, who sat on the floor, enchanted, but ready to move back to
work. She pretend tap-danced in the kitchen, ran in to show Dawn
the picture books she had stapled and illustrated. Often, when she was
near, Walker turned away from us. If she got him laughing hysterically,
he might even vomit. She was simply too dazzling.


Dawn, like me, was a talker. Every spare chance we had we talked.
When she spoke, she spoke of autism. Whereas Arlene (whose early
insight was responsible for bringing an autism expert on board) still
found "autism" a difficult word to articulate, Dawn was eager to use
it. Though for Arlene, the word <i>autism</i> seemed an epithet or a judgment
on Walker's character, a determination of his fate, for Dawn it
was a wake-up call.


"I called a consultant to talk about Walker," Dawn told me, "and
she thinks Walker's condition does sound like autism, especially the
way he has his good days and has bad days."


I was troubled, perplexed. "Why all the confusion? Don't you
know? Haven't you worked with hundreds of cases like this?"


"No," Dawn explained. "Nobody diagnoses autism this early."
Dawn had seen autism in toddlers and adults, but she had never seen
the symptoms of autism in a baby this young. Usually autism becomes
apparent at eighteen months or two years, when speech and social
skills are slow to develop. One of the major forms of autism shows a

We waited for the appointment with the neurologist, which was
scheduled for August. (Walker would be ten months old. It was the
earliest he could see Walker.) Dawn emboldened me to research. Now
I was no longer afraid to type the word into a search engine or to read
articles or books. I remember that Proust in <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>
says that love makes us into great scholars and researchers. Very quickly
I became both of these.


I was astounded to learn that over the previous ten years, the number
of children with autism had increased significantly. I asked a local
organization, Community Resources for People with Autism, for
some statistics about incidence of the disorder and was told that a
report merely three months old would be out of date. California,
reflecting a national trend, reported a 210-percent increase in a
decade. Estimates for current incidence nationwide varied, depending
on which web site I visited or which pamphlet I was able to get. Still,
even the conservative estimates seemed staggering, far more than I
ever imagined: One in 500 people. Some sources claimed the incidence
to be as high as one in 150.


Most of the experts agree that autism has a genetic component, but
genetics apparently represents only a piece of the puzzle. When I was
doing my research in 1997, several experts were speculating that a
relationship may exist between genetic propensity and environmental
causes. The possibility that pollution from pesticides or other chemicals
may be one culprit was being vigorously debated. Sometimes
autism showed up in "clusters"--mysterious concentrations of children
with diagnoses--in particular neighborhoods or cities.

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For some unknown reason, the percentage of young children with
autism had risen dramatically. Between 1965 and 1969, only 1 percent
of young children had autism. Yet by 1994-1995, the figure had risen to
17 percent. Some people, particularly parent advocacy groups, felt that
vaccinations might be the explanation. They considered vaccinations
problematic for two reasons: Kids are given too many at one time, being
exposed to as many as three diseases for each shot, and at times more
than one shot is given at once; and certain viruses or diseases in particular
were suspect.


I read that many parents in both the United States and England
reported a temporal relationship between the onset of autism and the
MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, given between the ages of
twelve and eighteen months in the United States. Opponents of the vaccination
theory suggest that some forms of the disorder simply tend to
arise at this age, yet others note that since the advent of vaccinations, the
kind of autism that appears at eighteen months, once considered rare,
began appearing with shocking frequency as these changes in vaccination
patterns occurred. Parent groups and some researchers assert that in
both the United States and England, a close relationship exists between
an increase in the use of the multiple vaccine and a rise in the incidence
of autism, though critics seem to insist that the relevant studies were
flawed.


Another possible culprit in vaccinations is mercury poisoning. At the
time I was researching, mercury was used in the vaccination additive
thimerosal. If a child was given more than one vaccination at a time, the
mercury level, some argued, might even be dangerously high. The symptoms
of mercury poisoning are hauntingly close to those of autism: sensorimotor
dysfunction, delayed reaction time, developmental delays.


Another theory suggested that the symptoms of autism were exacerbated,
or even caused, by food sensitivities. Though I had only heard in
June 1997 of one family of parents who had removed wheat and diary
products from their children's diets, by July I learned the numbers were
growing. Many parents reported observing dramatically positive effects.
Three years later, Karyn Seroussi was to publish <i>Unraveling the Mystery of
Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder</i>, arguing the same point; the
book would attract significant attention.


A partial explanation for the rise in incidence seemed to be that the
very definition of autism was expanding. In 1943, when the term was

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the far end of the spectrum are people dwelling in a Dantean
nightmare. They exist among us but not with us, without meaningful
speech or even language comprehension; theirs is a world of
objects rather than people. They may bite themselves or others,
scream out for no apparent reason, have uncontrollable tantrums,
thrash, bang their heads against walls, act as though in a trance, rock
back and forth, or wave their hands in incomprehensible patterns.
The worse cases involve severe mental retardation. Even in less
severe circumstances, children with autism may refuse or be unable
to look at others, or they may repeat phrases from Disney movies,
for example, or fragments of commercials, without seeming to know
what they've said. People with autism may engage in obsessive
behaviors, focusing on one thing and refusing to let it out of their
sight; they may stare at a stain on a rug and rub it incessantly. Some
such behaviors can cause severe injury, and sufferers must be institutionalized
or watched constantly by an aide. One woman I spoke
with told me that for an entire summer, she had worked with a man
with autism who lived in a residential hospital and engaged in one
activity alone: He hit his ears from behind, slapping at them with
both hands.


"That was my whole job," she said. "All summer ... trying to
keep him from doing it, and he never stopped. That's all he did."


"Why didn't you just let him do it?" I asked naively.


"He would have bled to death."

Dawn came once a week and worked with Walker for as much
time as she could. Like Arlene, she stayed far longer than she was supposed
to--lingering through her lunch hour, talking to me endlessly
while Walker slept.


Dawn was a storyteller, and while Walker slept or rested, like
Scheherazade she wove yarns. She spoke of her long history working
with disabled and autistic children, of the odd quirky and beguiling
behavior and personalities of children with autism, about the mystery
of the senses, about the slowness of psychologists to understand the
role that sensitivity plays in autism.


<i>Imagine a five-year-old girl with autism sitting in a room calmly.
Unexpectedly, she begins to scream. She throws her head to the ground and
thrashes wildly. The teacher assumes she's having a schizophrenic episode;
something in her own demented consciousness must be causing this girl's pain.
Such behavior continues periodically for years. One day someone enters the
boiler room next door to the classroom where our student is playing. The water
heater clicks on, emitting a low hum. Immediately, the child with autism begins
to scream and pull at her hair. Could the heater explain her behavior? The
teacher clicks off the heater. The child stops crying. She turns it on: the child
screams</i>.


<i>Once there was a conference during which a boy with autism was coming to
speak. Dawn and the rest of the audience had been advised not to wear perfume
or deodorant or to chew gum in the large conference room, lest it irritate
the sensitivities of the young speaker. He was introduced and quickly came into
the room, but he did not move toward the podium but instead began to move
toward someone's seat in the middle of the crowd</i>.


<i>"Can you please take that gum out of your mouth?"</i>


<i>He had not seen the gum, but acute sensitivity told him in the instant it
was there</i>.


Dawn taught me to see the devastating effects of autism, not fundamentally
as a disease of the spirit or the soul but as the secondary

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>I am beginning to realize that we can only know ourselves through the eyes
of another, through their reactions to us. How important it is, then, to be
aware of others' reactions. When our receptors don't work, it is as if the mirror
goes dim. We can't see people clearly and neither, then, can we see ourselves.
Over and over if such hack-and-forth messages go awry--stimulation
not well interpreted, reactions distorted--we will have a child who is
bound to grow mentally ill, seeing neither himself nor his world clearly. The
mind might grow like a weird bonsai, not because it was meant to, or
designed to, but because what it received from the world was unusual. The
sun grows dim, or too stark. The plant is cut too much. It grows beautiful,
but odd</i>.


I attended a meeting on autism and heard a story. I reproduce it
here as well as I can remember it.


<i>A boy heard voices ringing in his ears, throbbing in his head, voices prattling
the stuff of daily life--"I did not take your keys ..." "Well they
were on the bureau ..." "No, give me an apple instead." He spoke
about and repeated these voices, often verbatim, to his family. The boy
had seen many doctors, was diagnosed with schizophrenia, given various
drug therapies and sent away to an institution, One day when he was
eighteen years old, living at home again, he began articulating a series of
sentences. His mother, barely listening to the conversation--it had grown
to be the white noise of her days--left her son in midsentence and
stepped into the backyard to hang some laundry. As she approached the
fence, however, she heard something extraordinary--two women were
carrying on the second half of the conversation her son had begun in the
house</i>.


<i>Doctors were called in, and the diagnosis was changed. The boy was
not insane, living in an imaginary world; the voices were real. They had
always been real. All these years, he'd been hearing people speak, through
fences and through walls. No longer psychotic, he was now given the appellation
"autistic."</i>

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I called the presenter of this story to ask her if I could
interview the boy's family, she explained that it is a composite story
based on the experiences of two families of children with autism
she worked with--the families were extremely sensitive about their
children's disorders and she felt she needed to mask the particulars,
yet she asserted that this story carries the truth of many people's
experience with autism. It's not about insanity, but hypersensitivity.
The boy described above was not suffering from a problem of being
out of touch with the world, but quite the contrary: His "psychotic"
behavior, paradoxically, derived from what we might describe as an
overconcentration of the actual, too much of the real.


A young child repeating such voices in ancient times, in the
middle ages, might have been presumed to be possessed by evil spirits.
In the nineteenth and, indeed, most of the twentieth century, such
a child would most likely have been considered irremediably disturbed,
untreatable, mad. Still today, in some corners of the world such
tragic miscalculations are being made all the time.


"Is there such a thing as autism without a sensory processing disorder?"
I asked Dawn.


"None that I know of," she replied. I searched for an incidence of
autism without sensory dysfunction and found none myself. Sensory
processing disorder, the malfunctioning of the senses, was so integral
to autism spectrum disorder that there seemed to be no known cases
without it--though they can be present in typical individuals as well.


"What do you do to decompress?" asked the social worker. She sat on
the couch opposite me and Cliff. He had come home from work
specifically for the appointment. I wanted to ask her what she expected
of us. "Do you think we can just pop a couple of beers," I imagined
saying, "flip on some <i>I love Lucy</i> reruns, take a toss in the hay?"
But I didn't. Instead, Cliff answered. He talked wistfully about things
we had done when I was pregnant with Walker, of going to the

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The social worker clearly seemed to be on Cliff's side. She seemed
impressed by Cliff's efforts to see the bright side and was particularly
pleased when Cliff said that Walker was a "great little guy." She felt we
should go to the theater, that we should take walks. But when? My
insistence that we were simply too busy made her distrustful of me, as
if I were inventing a ploy to ... to what? I couldn't understand. I was
furious. How could Cliff seem so nonchalant? (It took me years to
understand that he was trying to hold up his end, to counterbalance the
uncontrollable flood of ballast I was taking on--the weight of my
inwardness, the closing in of ranks, the shutting off from the world, the
maniacal, obsessive need to research.) At that time it was just betrayal that
I experienced from Cliff. If he wasn't with me, I reasoned, he was against
me, seeming too focused on work, houses, money. The thought was too
hard to look at, too white hot. I turned away and looked down at the
rug.


While we talked, Walker lay on the ground, doing his push-ups.


"It's hard for me to relax when I'm worried," I said.


"Let's discuss your worries," she said.


"Arlene says we're making progress, but I'm fearful Walker will
regress. There is a kind of autism in which the child regresses."


"No, there isn't," she said.


"What?" I wasn't sure I was hearing her correctly. "Of course there
is. It happens at eighteen months."


"No," she said, "Autism is autism. Either you have it or you don't."


The room seemed to contract.


"What we really need is help," I said at length, changing the subject.
"Could you help us?"


"What do you need help with?"


"I need help making phone calls, or even to have an extra hand with
Walker while I make phone calls."


"I can see you're an excellent networker. You don't need my help.
Besides that's not why I'm here."


"Why are you here?"

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I'm here to talk about how you're handling all this, to talk about
your feelings."


She looked down at Walker, "Why don't you pick him up?"


"I don't want to overstimulate him." She looked at me quizzically.


<i>Did she believe that Walker's problems were my fault--that I simply wasn't
mothering him properly? Was it really possible that Walker's problem was my
fault?</i>


While the social worker spoke, my mind wandered. It seemed to me
that years ago my mother had told me of an autism expert who insisted
that autism was the fault of mothers. But I couldn't remember his name.
All I could remember was that he had an institute in Chicago, and that
years ago in the <i>New Yorker</i> I had read an article of his that I very much
admired. He was a high muckety-muck among psychologists. <i>What
was his name?</i>


Arlene arrived at the end of the meeting to work with Walker.
After saying good-bye to the social worker, I found myself slipping
away for a few minutes while Arlene took up work with Walker.


I pulled up a search engine and typed all the words I could think
of: "mothers," "autism," "fault," "blame," "cause." Two names appeared
in several entries, Bruno Bettelheim and Leo Kanner. Apparently the
latter had publicly recanted any claims to blaming mothers. The other
name I knew fairly well. My college professors in psychology used to
evoke the name with reverence; intellectuals in the coffeehouses
evoked it pompously. This was indeed the psychologist who had written
the <i>New Yorker</i> article I had so admired. Bettelheim had been a formidable
intellectual presence. I called Cliff at the University of
Massachusetts where he worked and asked him to bring any relevant
Bettelheim books home from the library. The one he brought was <i>The
Empty Fortress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self</i> (1967), which sat
on the kitchen counter for days until, one morning, I began flipping
through it as I sat on hold with a medical office. It seemed a mass of
words, a dense philosophical tome. Paragraph after paragraph
described with complexity and downright opacity the psychological
intricacies of what happens when a baby sucks a breast. I flipped further
and saw something about a mother's resentment, a mother's wish
that her child would die. I closed the book.

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For days I brooded. I had never wished Walker dead. In fact, I thought
often about a concept called "Mamatoto," from the Swahili, which I'd
learned about during my pregnancy. It is a concept that we Westerners
don't quite possess--the notion that mother and child are one.
Breathing together, feeding together. "How is Mamatoto?" Cliff
sometimes said when he came home from work. Yet still, I remembered
that when I was carrying Walker, everything had seemed dark.
It had been that way, too, with Elizabeth. Pregnancy never seemed to
agree with me. Darkness, like a cloak, seemed to fall between me and
the sun. It seemed to follow me everywhere. I became fascinated by
horror. The horror, I reasoned, was somehow related to my nausea,
which lasted far beyond morning and through most of the pregnancy.
As the nausea wore on, so did the darkness, the canopy. It moved
through the summer like a black parasol, following me, dogging me.
Drawn to dark worlds--mirroring my malaise?--I found myself reading
Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i> and Elie Wiesel's <i>Night</i>. Now I wondered if
I had somehow hurt my son by reading Shelley and Wiesel. <i>Are such
thoughts rational? If not, why do they feel so real to me? Why does the social
worker look at me and scribble things into her notes? Does she trust me?</i>


The following week I found myself again in the circle of parents in
the school classroom at night. Pamphlets were distributed. Same tired,
worn eyes were there, though some of the faces were new. The talkative
blond woman was talking quickly, loudly across the room again.
I looked down at a flyer on social learning classes for children with
autism while I listened to her speak. She talked about her son at
school, something about a soccer game, and the next moment I heard,
"Yes, he is a fraud. Didn't you know that? It came out in the press a
few months ago. All that stuff about blaming mothers--hooey."


I strained to hear, to learn if she was talking about Bettelheim, but
the meeting began and I couldn't bring myself to approach her afterward.
<i>Could it be that Bettelheim had been proven a fraud?</i> I went back to
the Internet. This time I typed in Bettelheim and fraud. First to pop
on screen: Review of two new biographies.


With help from Cliff, <i>The Creation of Dr. B:A Biography of Bruno
Bettelheim</i> was in my hands by nightfall.

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Clearly, one of the most surprising and disturbing parts of the
autism story did indeed lie with one of the twentieth century's most
charismatic and powerful intellectuals. For more than thirty years,
the conception and treatment of autism lay under the spell of this
brilliant Austrian, who seems to have bribed his way out of a concentration
camp in Germany and come to America with a compelling
and fecund literary imagination. Bettelheim presented a
résumé full of egregious misrepresentations--untruths that were
discovered only after his suicide in 1990. He claimed, for example,
to have three Ph.D.s, one in psychology, when in fact his sole doctorate
was in "philosophical aesthetics." He claimed to have been
caretaker for a girl named Patsy who was autistic. She was not. He
claimed to have been embraced by Freud, but no evidence is available
that they even met. Yet Bettelheim, who seems to have felt a
resentment of Nietzschian proportions, persuaded a credulous world
that he knew the cause of autism because he had seen the phenomenon
in the concentration camp: people retreat in "extreme situations."
As he explained in that seminal book, <i>The Empty Fortress</i>, the
cause of autism was an unloving mother who wished that her child
did not exist, a persecutor, a woman whose "black milk" (an image
from Paul Celan's poem about the death camps) so threatened her
child that he was forced into "autistic withdrawal." The term "refrigerator
mother" thrived under Bettelheim. Tragically, I learned, such an
explanation for autism still exists in some parts of the world.


Richard Pollak, the biography's author, explains that one of the
most important books to vindicate parents was written by the father
of an autistic child. In 1964, Bernard Rimland, the founder and now
the director of the Autism Research Institute, wrote <i>Infantile Autism:
The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior</i>.
Bettelheim dismissed Rimland's idea that autism is biologically based,
but Rimland was proved correct. I later discovered that in 1975, the
neurologist Stephen Hauser, then a medical student at Harvard, and
Robert DeLong, then the chief of pediatric neurology at
Massachusetts General Hospital, found abnormalities in the brain ventricles
of autistic subjects. In 1983, neurologists Margaret Bauman and
Thomas Kemper began dissecting the brains of subjects with autism,
finding abnormalities in the cerebellum and the limbic system.

After I read the biography about Bettelheim, I thought for several
days about the social worker. I guess it didn't matter what she
thought. I called and told her I didn't want her to come every week.
We were going to change Walker's environment to suit him--of
that I was certain--change it so he could learn. Even Cliff, though
reluctant to give up our freedom, agreed with me that if Walker
wasn't learning by being out and about, we must limit his time away
from home as much as possible. <i>But what if Walker didn't learn? What
if he proved part of the significant percentage who couldn't? Anyway, even
if nothing could be done, didn't the social worker understand grief?
We weren't going to be decompressing anytime soon</i>. In my journal, I find
a cryptic line: "There are no bowling alleys on the dark side of the
moon." It was the kind of bad poetry line I used to write in college,
but I remember the feeling behind it. It was my way of talking about
how useless seeking pleasure can be in the midst of darkness and
obsession. It was my way of trying to justify the fact that I didn't want
to have fun, didn't want to move to a new house, wouldn't be going
to the theater or even for a walk in the woods anytime soon.
