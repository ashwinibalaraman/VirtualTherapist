BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
[00:00:15]
CLIENT: So I was - I can't even remember. I was talking to Jess on the phone last week, and it must have been Friday after we met.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Or whenever we met. And I had sent her a text earlier that there was money in the account to pay for her office rent, which is like four twenty-five. And I kind of - when I was waiting for my car and didn't know how much it was going to be, told her that I'd have money for the kids this month. And so when I suggested that she was going to pay me back for the four twenty-five, she's like, "Well, I thought you were paying for the kids this month," then started going off how I haven't paid for the kids at all, and, you know, blah-blah-blah-blah. And you know, I was like, "Well, you know, I'm doing the best I can." [00:01:33]
And she suggested that - I don't know what - remember what her exact words were, but she said that I could be doing more to get more business. And I didn't really ask her what she meant by it, but, you know, I kind of just started accusing her of stupid things. You know, but it really upset me.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And...
(Pause [00:02:03] to 00:02:11.)
CLIENT: Maybe that - did we meet a different day last week, where we already talked about this?
THERAPIST: Yeah, we did. You know, I don't think we - we did not talk about this, but we did - because I was out at the time we usually meet. I think we met early on Thursday.
CLIENT: Maybe we - maybe we - Thursday.
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) o'clock on Thursday.
CLIENT: So this happened Thursday afternoon.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And it was like I was so upset I didn't do any work, I went home, and I was - I'm still kind of upset about it. I'm just like, you know - I don't know. She's made people - like yesterday on the phone, you know, she said, "Well, you're doing nothing," you know. You know, like I had time to do certain things because I'm doing nothing, you know.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Because I have no work. And that's kind of been bothering me. And I - [00:03:06]
THERAPIST: Oh, go ahead.
CLIENT: As I said, there's - you know, there's no use in me - you know, I was going to send her an e-mail, you know, saying how much that upset me. But it's like, you know, I'm arguing with - you know, nothing I say is really going to change anything. Or, you know, just set myself up for her to bring something else up that, you know, just - I don't know. I decided to just not say anything to her about it. But I saw Jen Weiner on Saturday morning and I was still upset then and...
THERAPIST: What's your sense - and I mean I'm not surprised I had some thoughts, but what's your sense of why or what about that was so upsetting? [00:04:12]
CLIENT: I don't know, because, you know - and like I said to her, I was like - I was like "You've got to be fucking kidding me," you know, because I had met with someone on Tuesday. I met with the financial guy at the bank on Wednesday, and we're going to be doing, you know, seminar together. I had a meeting set up for Friday. Was it Friday? Or no, I had a meeting set up for like 9:30 on Thursday, so I had already met with someone from AFLAC, this guy. Just, you know, so it's like I've been doing, you know, just a week of networking and she's telling me that I'm not doing enough, you know, to... And maybe I should have asked her, "Well, what more should I be doing, you know, to get more work?" You know, it just boggles my mind really what else... I mean I know there are things that I'm trying to do, but... [00:05:16]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're doing enough?
CLIENT: Yeah, you know. I mean I feel like the rug's been pulled out from underneath me, you know.
THERAPIST: In terms of business, you mean.
CLIENT: In terms of business.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I would imagine that's probably because the rug's been pulled out from under you in terms of business.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think maybe in the past there are things I could have done, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But, you know, right now, I think I'm doing - without banging on every door of every realtor office and every mortgage company and, you know, I mean... [00:06:04]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I don't have the motivation to do that and I don't, you know - it's a waste of time for the most part, you know.
THERAPIST: Sure. In fact, at least it's my sense that you're doing much more, especially over the last few weeks, than you've done in a while to really...
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I went to Rotary yesterday.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And Bristol, which I'm not so sure that Bristol is the right Rotary for me. I mean it was a St. Harry's Day thing between Rotary, Kiwanis, and Lions, so they had, like, a comedian there, you know. So it wasn't really a good chance for me to -
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: - to see what Rotary is like. But you know, it seems to be very - Bristol seems to be very community-oriented, and I really have no -
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know, my office is in Pembroke -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, there's really no connection with Bristol.
THERAPIST: Right. [00:07:05]
CLIENT: Where I think Concord, which I haven't been to, but I know a couple people at the Commerce Center who go to the Concord Rotary, that Concord is - since it's more - it's a bigger city -
THERAPIST: (Sneezing). Excuse me.
CLIENT: You all right?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Bless you. You know, Concord's a bigger city and it sort of - you know, Pembroke's a big commerce center because of the Commerce Center; that there's a lot more people from Pembroke in the Concord Rotary. You know, Pembroke has its own Rotary, which is supposed to be the best Rotary in the area, but that conflicts with E&amp;G.;
THERAPIST: Oh, I see.
CLIENT: Which is another sore spot that just, you know... I mean there's nine people at the meeting on Thursday. [00:08:02]
THERAPIST: Eww, sorry to hear that.
CLIENT: And no one - you know we're supposed to be doing ten letters a week to invite people to Visitors' Day.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And only like 5 of 13 people are doing letters. And it's just, you know - I don't know. I don't know where the group's head is, and I really don't - you know, I don't have the ability to put the group on my back and carry it forward and try and get... You know, I'm not - my office is in Pembroke. I'm not in that area to, you know, bring in businesses and, you know... It just...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And not that no one else cares, but not enough people care.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And the Visitor Day is going to suck. And we're not going to get new members.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know, maybe one or two, I don't know, but it's just... And E&G; is going to come in and they're going to clean the house and they're going to, you know - I'm okay if they move it to a morning E&G;, because if this E&G; falls apart, one of my good friends who does real estate in the Westford Group, used to do personal injury in our group, suggested I join his group as the estate planner. [00:09:31]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Which, you know, is a decent idea, but really sort of, you know, gets me away from the real estate, you know. I'd have to maintain my connections, you know, my connection.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, right now.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And that might be harder to do, you know, because E&G; gives you this sort of, you know - you know, I just wouldn't have that any more, you know. And I mean there are real estate attorneys in E&G; who don't get along with the realtor or the mortgage person. [00:10:24]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know, I mean... And Westford's a very successful group, you know. They've been up close to 50.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: And they're at, like, 35 right now.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: And they've lost some good members, but it's a good group. And our assistant director is in the group, so they do everything, you know, by the book. And, you know, I have no doubt that -
THERAPIST: Wait, sorry. What assistant director?
CLIENT: The assistant director, like, for -
THERAPIST: Oh, for the -
CLIENT: He oversees, you know...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: - like six chapters.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And he personally is in the Westford Group. [00:11:09]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So I think, you know, I would do okay in that group. I'd definitely have more estate planning business than I have now.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But, you know, I don't know, I would have to work a lot harder to maintain my mortgage connections and, you know... I mean because Phil would be the real estate attorney in the group and I wouldn't be able to get any real estate, you know?
THERAPIST: Right, right.
CLIENT: So the thought of moving away from real estate is not sitting well with me.
THERAPIST: Right. How busy is Phil?
CLIENT: He's busier than I am. You know, I do his title work. So he had two closings last week, you know, a re-fi and a purchase. You know, I mean he just sent me another title order, so he's busier than I am. I mean I've got like one closing, you know, with the bank. Who knows when it's going to close. [00:12:17]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And then a couple of - that I haven't got the orders on that I know are in the pipeline and, you know, my guys, and E&G;, but he's busier than I am.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, and I mean I remember when he - I mean I basically have helped him with everything, starting up real estate, you know. He started from scratch, and, you know, I do it - every title I've done for him I've had to explain what he needs to do on certain things.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And he rents space in an office where there's a paralegal, so he gets advice from her as well. [00:13:04]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But, you know, I've basically trained him, and I don't know. And then, you know, once again it's - you know, it's Westford, you know, which is, you know, not like Wareham, made sense from a Pembroke perspective, but, you know, the group was a lot more spread out, where the Westford Group is more people from Westford and that area, you know.
I don't know. I just - seems like I don't have many decent options lying ahead of me, you know, and that I've really got to use the Chamber and get into one of these Rotaries. [00:14:01]
THERAPIST: This may be a stupid question, but is Pembroke the best place to be? I mean are there other areas that... I mean I guess my thought is if things are slow enough now that not a lot is coming through there, and the connections you have there in terms of E&G; as well as, like, the mortgage guy who moved, aren't what they used to be...
CLIENT: Well, the current mortgage guy is in the Commerce Center, you know.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I started to do a little networking in the Chamber. And, you know, I'm doing this coffee connection thing on Friday. But I think there's just more opportunities -
THERAPIST: I see. I see
CLIENT: - in the Commerce Center. And I'm doing that housing court thing in Concord.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So I'm kind of...
THERAPIST: Yeah. So you're working at stuff that, over time, could make a difference. [00:15:08]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I mean, you know...
THERAPIST: I know you've been doing stuff. I just didn't have a quick sense of the job.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it really would be starting from scratch. I mean there's a similar - and I had looked at it in North Westford, something like office space.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Executive suites, shared space, and decided on Pembroke because of the Commerce Center, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I've gotten business over the years because people want to work with someone on the Commerce Center.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So, you know, I don't know. Just hard decisions I don't want to make or have to make. And, you know, I just - to a large degree, it's scary, you know? I'm facing just not growing my business, you know, and just - I mean I haven't, you know, seen squat from Claire, and, you know, I can't - I can't live on - at the pace I'm going. [00:16:38]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I mean I can't get mad at Jess because, you know, she's been pulling all the weight. And it's been a year now, over a year, that I've been slow, you know. I mean things were actually a little busier at times last year, you know, but I don't know what to do. You know, and I'm just... You know, I look around me and there are people that are successful and it's like what have they done that I haven't done, you know? And...
(Pause [00:17:27] to 00:17:35)
CLIENT: I don't know. I mean E&G; is not the be-all, end-all, but it's been a huge portion of my business and...
THERAPIST: How much of that has been Ray?
CLIENT: Oh, it was - all of it. You know, I mean Ray was - we did a ton of business together.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And, you know, the mortgage guy has gotten some referrals. And for one reason or another, they're have been - delayed or not, you know... Just I mean there's a chance that I could work and I could continue using this guy. I've sent him business, but other attorneys sent him business. So...
(Pause [00:18:28] to 00:18:33)
CLIENT: You know, and Rotary is one of these things where, you know, you're not supposed to talk about business.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm, right.
CLIENT: You know, we can get fined if you talk about business. So it's something where I've got to make a commitment of just getting to know people is really what it's going to be. You know, just being a known quantity.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And then, you know, ultimately people do learn. I think it's actually on your name tag. [00:19:02]
THERAPIST: I was going to say.
CLIENT: What you do.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know... So...
(Pause [00:19:08] to 00:19:15)
CLIENT: I'm just scared.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I'm really - the anxiety I had last week was just - I mean was crazy, and I spent most of Saturday with the kids, which kind of distracted me.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And then all day Sunday, you know, gorgeous day, and I'm inside watching, you know, basketball and just trying to keep my mind off of, you know, all the other crap I've got to do in my life.
THERAPIST: I see. So it sounds like this is part of what was so upsetting about what Jess said. It's not that it played on a doubt of yours that you weren't doing enough. It's more that it just touched on this issue that you're really scared about, which is not knowing where the money's going to come from, or (crosstalk) going to come from.
CLIENT: I mean I'm like - do I need to get a second job, you know? Do I need to work at Starbuck's at night, or... I mean is it... I don't know. And...
(Pause [00:20:32] to 00:20:40)
CLIENT: I'm not sure, you know. It's like I don't know - something went wrong somewhere and, you know, it's just - I mean part of it is the business I'm in has slowed up tremendously.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: And, you know, I've gotten, like, a new client every so often from the website, you know. I just got a retainer for, you know, condo collection, that woman who called me a couple of weeks ago.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: That was from the website. And, you know, I just...
(Pause [00:21:21] to 00:21:37)
CLIENT: You know, a friend of Jess's, they need some landlord/tenant help, and so, you know, I said to Jess, I'm like, you know, "What should I charge them?" And she's like "Well, you know, you probably should charge them like 75 bucks an hour, you know, because they've done a lot to help out with, do you know, like, covering for childcare."
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: And stuff like that. And, you know, so basically, you know, working for free practically.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And just - and she always keeps bringing up how, you know, she makes 55 bucks or 65 bucks or whatever it is on her criminal defense cases; it's like that's by choice, you know. I mean, you know, you've got the ability - you've got unlimited, almost, access to those cases. [00:22:39]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I mean I don't have access to that, you know?
THERAPIST: Um-hmm, right.
CLIENT: I applied years ago for - to get on to one of the lists and, you know, nothing ever came of it. They're so overwhelmed, you know, with people applying that, you know - she has all the connections where she knows the people, you know, involved, and, you know... I mean they weren't - you know, they're taking applications, but they weren't training people. And, you know, I don't know if - I could be doing work for Jess to help her do more, you know. [00:23:25]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: I don't know. It's just...
(Pause [00:23:28] to 00:23:37)
CLIENT: I don't know that. Something good did happen though to me. You know, I had taken out a loan on Ian's life insurance policy.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: It was like 850 bucks. And so that came in the mail yesterday. And then I get this envelope, where I did the partial.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm, I remember it. [00:24:02]
CLIENT: And it was a handwritten, and I'm like, "Oh, my God, what are these guys..." You know, billing me for something?
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And inside was a check for $611, which was what I paid when I went in there for my deductible. And I guess maybe my - I met my deductible or something and they returned it.
THERAPIST: Great.
CLIENT: Which, you know, now I've got an extra $600.
THERAPIST: Well, good.
CLIENT: Which, you know, basically it's enough money to put into the business account with the $850 to cover the football tickets, you know? I don't know. I'm supposed to have this closing with the bank, and this woman calls me on the weekend and she's just all confused on the title with the wrong deed and the wrong - you know, just incompetent. So it's like, you know, they called me in February and asked me about the title work, and I said "Yeah, I'll have it to you this week." And they're like "Good, because we want to close in March." And it's like March is running out. You know, we've had a... [00:25:28]
You know, and I've got this sale at the end of the month where that's going to be 850 bucks. But they don't want to take the money out of the sale, which is the normal course where I'd be paid from the sale. They want to pay me out of the estate, so I'm thinking of sending them a bill today. You know, I only have communications with one - there's two trustees - with one of the trustees. The other trustee is the one who has - is the executor of the estate. So...
(Pause [00:25:59] to 00:26:13)
Started doing the paperwork for the IRS and that's just...
THERAPIST: I think you're so anxious about the money and business that it really makes it hard for you to think. I think it sort of makes you much like kind of obsessional and kind of litanizing (ph) in how you sort of go through it instead of allowing you to really like think about what makes sense to do.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well...
THERAPIST: Am I being clear? Like do you know what I mean?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it stops me from doing work. I just, you know - I can't - I just can't...
(Pause [00:27:07] to 00:27:25)
THERAPIST: Like...
(Pause [00:27:25] to 00:27:43)
THERAPIST: Are there any options really for other things you could be doing beyond all the stuff you've been starting to do?
CLIENT: I don't know, you know? I mean I'm like...
THERAPIST: Is there anybody who would - else around who would have good ideas?
CLIENT: I don't know. The real estate attorneys keep everything very close to the vest. You know, I remember once Jess asked - she had a client or had a colleague who did real estate and was asking him, you know, if - this was years ago - you know, if he could mention me or help me out or whatever. And he was just like "No way," you know, because it's all about your contacts, you know, and getting the loans and whatever. You know, I mean I just - yeah, I'm kicking myself, but, you know, having not been involved in the Chamber... You know, there's all these businesses. There's a lot of networking opportunities I just haven't been doing, and now I've just got to start doing them.
THERAPIST: Yeah. And maybe if you're doing that, you're doing what you can do.
CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I don't know what - you know, the guy who's in the Bristol Rotary, he's like been in for a year, and he hasn't seen any business from it, but he enjoys it, you know. [00:29:18]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I think, though, when I'm in the Concord Rotary, I might run into those people at the Chambers, and they come just walking down the halls at the Commerce Center and, you know...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I don't know. Just... And the other big thing I did last week was I went and got a Andover parking sticker. Have we talked about that?
THERAPIST: I think you mentioned that, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. Which now I need to figure out where the resident parking is around here. It doesn't matter for - well, it will matter for Tuesdays in April. [00:30:12]
THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, there's a bunch of it on the side streets.
(Pause [00:30:21] to 00:30:37)
CLIENT: And then you just couple it all with I'm just - I don't want to say I'm paralyzed, but I'm just so - my motivation is just not there. You know, it's like, today, I've got a client coming in at 2:00 o'clock to sign a health care proxy. You know, there's $150 or whatever I told him I'd charge him. And then there's a thing online about short sales, and I'm just going to - you know, it's like an hour long; figured I'd watch that because it's free. But just - I don't know. I'm just so - I don't know. I just don't have the motivation to do stuff, to do my work. Put everything off until the last second. Yeah.
(Pause [00:31:43] to 00:31:53)
THERAPIST: Well, I think you're really worried about getting deeper and deeper into a hole financially again. I think it's really hard to step back at all from that worry so that you have some space to think and I think you just shut down.
(Pause [00:32:17] to 00:32:27)
THERAPIST: You know, you are - trying to think - to me, doing a lot more stuff. I mean you're really able to focus a lot more on work. And, you know, I remember us talking not that long ago about all of this networking stuff. And you're saying like, "Yeah, I know I should be doing this, I know I should be doing that. I just can't get myself to do it." Well, now you can.
I mean you really have been - it's been gradual, but you've really been ramping up a lot over the last, I guess, nine months or so, especially in terms of just what you can do. I mean your capacity to work has really increased a lot. I remember when it was, you know - you weren't doing any of the networking. And I guess you're doing E&G; but... And, you know, you could work maybe ten percent of the time. I mean things really, I think, have gotten certainly better since then. I know you're not where you want to be, and I know you're not anywhere near your, like, real capacity. But I think you are doing a lot more than you were. And I think it's hard for you to see that or feel reassured by it because you're so scared.
(Pause [00:33:56] to 00:34:10)
CLIENT: Yeah.
(Pause [00:34:10] to 00:34:20)
THERAPIST: You don't know what's going to happen from the efforts that you're making, but I know that you're making a lot more of an effort than you were three months ago, six months ago, nine months ago. I mean you weren't really in shape to do much networking, like, last summer. I mean you were having a lot more trouble.
(Pause [00:34:37] to 00:34:42)
CLIENT: Yeah. I remember I wasn't having problems with the dog because I was at home all day with the dog, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
(Pause [00:34:48] to 00:35:39)
CLIENT: Scared. Harry asked me if I was having suicidal thoughts.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I say "There are times I wish I was dead," you know. Someone was - the mortgage guy, Harry, was telling me about there's an attorney who became a loan officer that just passed away at age 46. [00:36:12]
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: And my response to Harry is this, "Lucky bastard," you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I feel like that. You know, it's like, you know...
(Pause [00:36:28] to 00:36:35)
THERAPIST: Feel like you've had enough.
CLIENT: Yeah.
(Pause [00:36:37] to 00:36:58)
CLIENT: Everything is like it is just a chore, you know. And I just have so many things that seem to be just blowing up or going wrong. Or, you know, it's like shirts; I don't have any dress shirts that don't have, you know, the ring of sweat around...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know? It's like - I've got like two shirts, you know? And I don't have the money to even go to Kohl's and buy a $10 shirt, you know? You know, great, I have the $600, found money, but, you know, I'm going to be paying it right over to the vet on Thursday.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know? And I thought this bank thing was going to go through by now and it hasn't, and so I don't know that I'm going to get the money this month. And, you know, I don't know when I'm going to get the $850 from these people. And I know I've got this $2,000 retainer and, you know, I'll probably use that to cover expenses at the end of the month and put myself farther in the hole, you know, waiting for those things to come in, which I shouldn't be doing, but, you know, I feel desperate, you know. I'm desperate.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
(Pause [00:38:40] to 00:38:51)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
(Pause [00:38:51] to 00:39:25)
CLIENT: You know, I feel like, you know, E&G; is just like the loan modification and the IRS. It's like I'm waiting for it to be resolved.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, like to me it's not an ongoing thing, which it really is.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But I'm waiting for it to be resolved.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I almost want to tell Luke, who is our assistant director, that, you know, I can't do it. You know, that E&G; has got to come in and reshape this thing, you know, and that means getting up at 5:00 in the morning because they're going to move it to the morning. You know, it starts at 7:00.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So - or 5:30 in the morning or - I don't know. It's just...
(Pause [00:40:24] to 00:40:31)
CLIENT: It's just that it's amazing to me that there are people in the group who really benefit from the group. And now, the CPA, she's overwhelmed with taxes, I understand that.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: The people just don't come to meetings.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: You know, they don't - you know, it's like the life insurance guy; he hasn't been there in three weeks. You know, he's been out of town.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: He's got trainings, you know, and he was iffy on renewal because he hasn't gotten any business. And it's like -
THERAPIST: Right. [00:41:06]
CLIENT: You know, you've got to show that you care and do things and set up one-to-ones, and, you know, people just aren't doing it, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And when you aren't doing it and there's 20 people in the group, you don't notice it as much.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Well, there's 13 people in the group and only 9 show up, one of whom is a sub.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know?
THERAPIST: That really makes a difference.
CLIENT: And, you know, it's difficult for me because I had actually - I had talked to Jess before E&G;, I think, because I remember being so upset.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, going to E&G;, you know, I'm supposed to put on a happy face, and here I am completely upset, faking it, you know, for nine people.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: One of whom is me.
THERAPIST: Yeah. We've got to stop for now.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, let me know about later on Friday if you have anything.
THERAPIST: Okay, I will.
CLIENT: So...
THERAPIST: I will. I'll let you know by the end of the day when we're out there.
CLIENT: Yeah. If not, I'll see you tomorrow.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Continue this - follow the conversation. [00:42:37]
