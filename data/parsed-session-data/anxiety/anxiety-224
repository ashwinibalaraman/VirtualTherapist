BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
PATIENT: Kind of, not really. Last three days though, before this, I really was unbelievable. I didn't ... it looked like I was going to, I don't know what it was like, I was just so tight, you know, and just ... really weird it was awful. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday it was like (inaudible - 0:00:34.4), like one of those screams. I don't know why but ... and the least little thing would bother me  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - to the point where I just, you know.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it just really bugged me to no end, it was awful. I don't know why, I never experienced that before.
COUNSELOR: It was kind of really on edge?
PATIENT: Yeah, and like I had all of a sudden an instant headache, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and having to explain it to (inaudible - 0:01:04.6). Doing time and things just seemed too much.
PATIENT: Yeah, it just like really.
COUNSELOR: I get real irritable.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. It just, and little things.
COUNSELOR: Show feelings because things you start to feel here, well (inaudible - 0:01:16.1) person.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, right. Yesterday it was like it was a beautiful day there's no kids  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - because all we had were parents and I was feeling.
COUNSELOR: Which we know is the IQ days.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, the IQ days so other then time about 2:30 I said I was finished, so we sat down and talking all of a sudden at about 10 after 3 this woman walks in who just irritates me to end and I just like, I just wanted to tell her to go to hell. I want to go home, just get out of may, you know, and I laughed at her. She was (inaudible - 0:01:55.4) about her son and she just kept on insisting that her son was in fifth grade and he was in fifth grade and I laughed at the poor woman. I said Mrs. Mays you don't even know your own child, which is really unbelievable. It was really weird and I just, you know, and then I just walked out, she really bugged me, so it was awful. Well, at any rate and then, when was it, Tuesday, Wednesday, Wednesday I guess it must have been, this friend of mine called, I haven't heard from him in a long time, you know.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: In fact he was my student teacher about almost three years ago  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - almost three years ago, he's really a nice guy and he's strange.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:02:54.2) he's really strange though, really strange. And I hadn't talked to him in a long time and I was really surprised to hear from him. And he always struck me as being a little weird, he's like a mystery man, you never know, you just don't know about Jim, he's just really strange. And he called me and he talks so fast  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - just like incisively, just fast and besides that he's black and the inflection  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - of this fastness, you know just slow down, he's hyperactive.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Very hyperactive, very strange person. Anyway, he called and he was talking about well some theatrical group he was talk, start, you know, and then he gets off in a tangent and just what are you doing and I said well, I'm getting ready for parent interview day but I'm not. And he said what are you doing this minute and I said well I'm not, I'm just about to get ready to prepare for parent interview day and he says well why don't you come by and I said well okay and we went by. And he only lives three blocks away and he's married and he has got a couple of kids, his wife and nobody is home and I said oh where's Kim and the kids? He says I don't know where they are. And that's the strange thing about it, like they both do their thing.
COUNSELOR: Independently of each other.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, really independent it's really weird. And so he says oh let's go out and so we went to this restaurant (inaudible - 0:04:32.5) so we went and got a sandwich and we were talking and having a good time and everything else. And then he says well let's go back to your place, I said okay fine. So then we went back to my place and we had a couple of glasses of wine and then he kept on bringing up the subject of bed and everything and I really think he was, he's a homosexual  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - and I really think of it now.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It crossed my mind before.
COUNSELOR: Oh before.
PATIENT: Before, yeah, but like I never it never you know like  -
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:05:03.5) more about it.
PATIENT: Yeah, right I just  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - the thing was he's so mysterious, you know, you could never be right if you said he was. He could be mad at you and convince you that he wasn't.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He's really a strange person.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:05:17.4).
PATIENT: Yeah, right. Something about what time do you go to bed? And then say well I didn't want to keep you up, stuff like this. And he says something about you ready to go to bed and said no thanks Jim and he said well whenever you're ready to go home or something like this and it's a really weird conversation.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. But somehow you feel like he was kind of  -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: - leaving something open to you?
PATIENT: Right, right, you know, the inflections and things like this. And I was sitting there and you put, he's stretched out and he was in an accident like a year ago, a really bad accident, a car accident and he's lucky he's alive for that matter. And he gets terrific headaches now. He was on cocaine and everything. He gets terrific headaches now so he was stretched out on the couch, I was sitting at one end and he's putting his feet up all over me, which really didn't mind, you know.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I just thought he was going comfortable but I don't know if that was it or not, to come to think of it.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. You mean it might have some seduction?
PATIENT: Yeah, right, right. And it's really, like I said he and his wife are so independent from one another and like they both take separate vacations  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - they go on their separate ways. (inaudible - 0:06:28.8) in the spring they teach and she teaches in a private school and he teaches in a public school, they both, you know, I can understand it, they're not both off at the same time but during the summer they both separate vacations.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Just kind of strange but I thought well. And then we got on the subject of marriage and I had mentioned that I had been thinking about getting married and all this stuff and he was very kind of against it. And he said that he wouldn't and he said that, you know the old thing, you change and you're never the same and all this stuff (inaudible - 0:07:10.1). And then he said with my situation I'm lucky something that I can do what I really enjoy doing and stuff like this.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's another thing that made me think.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But it was really strange. And then like I was sitting there and then all of a sudden he pulled me back, you know, I was just lying there next to him and it was nothing, like there was nothing for me at any rate. And he brought up the subject of going to bed again and said no, no, you can forget Jim or something like this.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that was about it but it really.
COUNSELOR: It sounds like he really made you uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yeah, well it was, you know, it was really a strange thing, it was really weird. And like I was surprising for me with that experience with him after I had known him so long that this had never happened before, it had never really happened before. It was weird, it really was and it bothered me too.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it kind of generally disturbing.
PATIENT: Yeah, it bothered me.
COUNSELOR: How did it bother you?
PATIENT: To the fact that, you know, then bringing up the subject of - oh when we were talking about marriage he said if you're, he got on the social thing too.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You don't marry for a social thing and all this stuff, blah, blah, blah. And then he said, went into say that he's fortunate that he can do the thing that, you know  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - enjoy what he wants to enjoy with his wife not being there.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But like I said he never, it was never a direct it was always like a game  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - and you're kind of like figuring out.
COUNSELOR: Is that what bothered you? You had to kind of be figuring out?
PATIENT: I don't know what, yeah, that.
COUNSELOR: Sort of like  -
PATIENT: And that
COUNSELOR: - he be seductive?
PATIENT: Yeah and that like he, he knew about me. Of course, he's a very perspective person too, in fact he's a licensed (inaudible - 0:09:20.9). He kind of knew about me.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I just.
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like  -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: - sort of like he had your number.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: And he was trying to get you?
PATIENT: Yeah, it was really, it was very strange, it really was, it was really weird.
COUNSELOR: Kind of must (inaudible - 0:09:43.6).
PATIENT: Yeah, it was really, it was awkward. It was really and like it bothered me and then Tanya came by yesterday  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - and we had gone to bed and everything and well like I, like when we were getting ready to go to bed like I was taking her clothes off  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - I felt as if I was going to explode any minute.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But then getting right down to the act of intercourse itself, I couldn't get an erection  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - again and she says what's wrong and I said I'm worrying about it again.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Oh. I still was tensed up inside.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I just, it was really maddening.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It was really maddening. And I was like, you know, I just felt so rotten.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It was really maddening, just unbelievable.
COUNSELOR: Kind of like it had been really nice and you did well and got tense.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, I just ...
COUNSELOR: Kind of like you had felt really clear about it all (inaudible - 0:10:48.6) worries.
PATIENT: I guess yeah it really did. I just started thinking about it and I was just like (inaudible - 0:11:00.4). I thought of it like, like you're a baseball underneath (inaudible - 0:11:09.0) and it's all tight  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - that's the way it kind of like felt.
COUNSELOR: You were all wound up.
PATIENT: Wound up it was like string  -
COUNSELOR: Tight and (inaudible - 0:11:15.3).
PATIENT: - yeah, right and all it just like break it apart like this and it was really  -
COUNSELOR: Bounce (inaudible - 0:11:20.8).
PATIENT: Yeah, right, it was really weird, it was really weird, it was just awful. But at any rate and I didn't enjoy it after that at all, you know like Tanya, Tanya and I, then after that I said well, I'm just going to sit here and relax, lie here and relax for awhile.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then I become aroused  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - with the help of Tanya and it was okay but nothing like before it was just kind of like, really kind of a, it was kind of like I mean not as well as the previous times.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It was like well it's over with, it wasn't really anything fantastic.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible - 0:12:10.8).
PATIENT: It was really. And then I thought about, well then do I really like girls getting on that thing again.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like because it wasn't so great and you felt some initial trouble getting an erection it was kind of like  -
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: - well, raise all sorts of questions to you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, and the fact that and Jim bringing up the same questions that bothered me.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It was really  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - it was, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like, it's not like, you know, you're really feeling so sure and like  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - your problems are solving kind of like, you know, was the fact of not having an erection and you did have intercourse not finding it thrilling.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: You know, it's kind of like that's enough to kind of make you feel (inaudible - 0:12:54.7) of this.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, right.
COUNSELOR: Is that stated?
PATIENT: Yeah, it was like, you know like wow, it was really unbelievable. I don't know maybe I was thinking about it must be just accumulation of things.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I was just feeling rotten and all for three days and seeing Jim and having that experience.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, that experience probably kind of disturbed you.
PATIENT: Yeah, and not.
COUNSELOR: It certainly wasn't overtly sexual experience, it really was.
PATIENT: Yeah, it was, it really was, it was.
COUNSELOR: It wasn't like there was any sex but you knew that was what you wanted  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - you were pretty damn sure.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, that's the truth. He's a weird dude, he really is strange. He's funny as hell though. He's really strange. Like he, he's the type that, when he got out of school, out of undergrad school, like okay maybe two years ago  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - wait let me see, two and a half years ago, something like that, been close to death, like really got in a bad accident, got his Master's Degree, and he has got three more hours and then he'll have 36 hours beyond his Master's Degree.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He goes to school excessively, it's school, school, school, school, you know like during the summer most people would take six hours or the summer session  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - he'll take nine or twelve.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And he's very brilliant and very smart but really strange, a really strange person very hyperactive. And I thought to myself all of this happened, this all can't happen within a span of two days.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I said no way.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, just kind of a lot of stuff that really happened  -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: - very unsettling like you're feeling  -
PATIENT: Right. I said no way this all can't happen in two days.
COUNSELOR: I guess you kind of feeling unsettled now then.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, really, that's the truth, really that's the truth, really feeling like I just can't even sit here. Feeling like you just ...
COUNSELOR: It just really agitates you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. I was really, I don't know, I don't know, like I don't even know what to do about it.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I can't even rationalize any more.
COUNSELOR: What do you mean rationalize?
PATIENT: Well, you know why are all these feelings jumping at me at once? Why am I feeling wound up? Why is all this worrying me? Why can't I relax?
COUNSELOR: Well, it's worrying you because it's not like, yeah you feel like getting all tense when you don't want to be.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, I just.
COUNSELOR: And it's kind of like, I guess it's like it felt great to be to finally sleep with Tanya  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: You know it's kind of not like, it's not a thing that is solved or you feel find about it overnight  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - maybe, (inaudible - 0:15:58.7) and having someone come really kind of inviting you to a homosexual experience  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - can be, you know, feel unsettling.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Because it raises your past feelings of guilt  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - or feeling  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - it means (inaudible - 0:16:18.1) you can be upset about the next time you're with Tanya  -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: - it's like you're carrying the residues of all that.
PATIENT: Yeah, right. That's alright but then I was thinking well I had called Tanya and she was coming by and I thought well I'll feel much better when I'm with her.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That didn't turn out too well either so it was just like something else.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:16:40.2), it's like when you sometimes feeling upset or disturbed it's not so easy  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh, really.
COUNSELOR: - (inaudible - 0:16:51.5).
PATIENT: Yeah. It's unfamiliar, I don't feel so bad today though.
COUNSELOR: The thing is, you know, the problem is you maybe can worry about those type of things too much and then it starts to be your bad  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - you know it's like worrying about having an erection.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: It's the same kind of thing, if you worry about having an erection it goes more of a problem.
PATIENT: Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: If you worry about worries then they become bigger worries.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I mean do you see that?
PATIENT: It's so hard for me not to worry though.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It really is hard for me not to worry, like until it's really, you know like until it's really done, it's really  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - hard for me not to worry, I don't know why.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's just really - like I have this thing, you know this thing that the scenery has to be done by next Wednesday for this thing that the kids are putting up.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I really there's a lot to do, you know, a lot to get done.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I just haven't had the time.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And like one of the teachers out today and there wasn't a sub so that meant I couldn't go over there and do this. It was like and I really worried about it, like it won't be finished.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And there's really nothing to worry about, if it's not finished well so what I keep on telling myself.
COUNSELOR: Sure, it's not like the end of the world.
PATIENT: Right, it's not going to be like the end of the world. Oh, and I get to the point where I even dream about it.
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like there's so much going through your mind that you can't get a peaceful night sleep.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: This is going through your mind at night.
PATIENT: Awful, like god. I need to I don't know a day off that's for sure.
COUNSELOR: Maybe get two won't you?
PATIENT: Get two months off.
COUNSELOR: Tell me that tomorrow is  -
PATIENT: Oh yeah right, right that's true, that's true, that's true and I'm looking forward to that. One thing I had a day off during the week, those are always much better because those you  -
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:18:50.1).
PATIENT: - yeah, right. The week after next I'm going to take a day off, I have to. And these kids are getting to me too, really bugging me. Of course, today it was like the ones who didn't have a part in the play had to sit in the classroom so I had a classroom full of children with nothing to do.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And a day at 90, whatever it is outside.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they're going crazy and I'm going crazy so I just said okay let's go outside and we'll just play baseball which is fantastic.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It made me feel much better and they felt great too. Because there was, you know, like there just wasn't any sense trying to get something done and neither one of us really.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: Nobody was doing anything.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:19:36.0).
PATIENT: And it was very relaxing, it really was, I found it very relaxing. I was thinking about yoga, that's an up and coming thing, to relax. I don't know do they offer a class, do you have a class anywhere where they offer you?
COUNSELOR: No, but I'm sure they have them around (inaudible - 0:19:54.3).
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It tends to be a pretty popular.
PATIENT: Oh yeah it's the great fad.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: A woman I work with is involved in it and she oh, she comes to work with a great, I mean really looking good. It's just so, so relaxing and everything (inaudible - 0:20:11.2). It really did her a hell of a lot of good. But, that's my whole problem.
COUNSELOR: Okay. It just kind of goes (inaudible - 0:20:25.9) how you are  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - I want you to just take more things in stride.
PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know why.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:20:35.4) worries  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - have the (inaudible - 0:20:39.8) or something, you know, just peaceful  -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: - low lying.
PATIENT: Yeah. I remember a nun referring to me as a worry-wart.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Come to think of it. I just thought about that, which is strange and that was in grammar school.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Very young in grammar school, I think it was about fourth grade, come to think of it. Fourth or fifth grade or something like that, I think it is a music nun or something, from her (inaudible - 0:21:18.7), which I didn't appreciate it.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I always worried if I was going to have my homework done  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - always worried about am I going to pass or fail, like really worried, you know like really scared and I see someone  -
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:21:43.1).
PATIENT: - yeah, I see some kids like that today too and I just have to like it's no big deal.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it doesn't make things any easier.
PATIENT: Uh-uh.
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you get through the things with a whole lot more psychological glare or something then you would if you just didn't worry about it.
PATIENT: Yeah, really, that's the truth.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:22:00.8).
PATIENT: Yeah, that's the truth. Christ. If I don't have anything to worry about I would find something to worry about. Maybe if I were more organized.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I won't have to worry, that's for sure. You know as if I should take up basket weaving or something. I use to even bite my nails. I don't know if I can beat that habit.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:23:15.1).
PATIENT: Yeah, right. I should be able to beat worry. I just got in the form I didn't have time to bite my nails any more.
COUNSELOR: Too worried about  -
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: - biting your nails.
PATIENT: Yeah, I was too worried about something else to go about biting my nails. (inaudible - 0:23:34.8) turn to a smoking I don't know. Oh well, it just moves too fast.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you think.
PATIENT: It really does.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kind of sense that you just (inaudible - 0:23:51.8) you know that you do it over  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - and it's just like the feeling that (inaudible - 0:23:59.0) part of you which wish you weren't.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Just wishing more relaxed (inaudible - 0:24:07.2).
PATIENT: It's about everything.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you really feel like, I feel more relaxed (inaudible - 0:24:13.8).
PATIENT: Uh-huh. I was talking like, you know I was talking to Tanya, I said I'm a perfect candidate for becoming an alcoholic or becoming a dope addict, really.
COUNSELOR: You getting an ulcer.
PATIENT: Yeah, right or getting an ulcer right. And I thought wow that's really bad because I could, I really, really could. That's why I don't think I would ever try it, because I was afraid I would become addicted to like dope at any rate. And the alcohol, well lately well it has been half, like I'm going to have a drink and really I did that before. The last three days I've had the ... it's really strange. And I think and then you think, then you start worrying about that. You think oh Christ and you can't even have a drink without worrying that you're going to turn into an alcoholic (inaudible - 0:25:14.8). At least I'm not worrying about guilt feelings, I'm living a clean life. I just thought about that, that's one way I kind of messed up. A step forward if nothing else but then that gives me something else to worry about in turn.
COUNSELOR: That's the way it is  -
PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:26:02.3) started from.
COUNSELOR: - and that's really the way life is (inaudible - 0:26:07.8) there is always going to be something to worry about.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: And like you feel like you're going through a hard time and you have 50 things to worry about and then when things are better you maybe feel like you made some steps forward it's like other things (inaudible - 0:26:24.7)  -
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
COUNSELOR: - kind of.
PATIENT: Yeah and that's it, yeah, uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you do have a worry (inaudible - 0:26:30.9).
PATIENT: That's the truth.
COUNSELOR: You use it.
PATIENT: That's the truth.
COUNSELOR: No matter how smooth things are  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh. It must be hereditary, both of my parents (inaudible - 0:26:45.9).
COUNSELOR: Oh, I'm not sure why (inaudible - 0:26:49.6) so much as parents who maybe have another way of looking at parents who worry a lot (inaudible - 0:26:57.1).
PATIENT: That's true too, yeah. Make a big deal out of it. Right. My mom she was she didn't she isn't the type that worries, at least, she isn't the type, she usually lets everything out.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: My father is another thing. My mother she had an ulcer, she didn't get an ulcer for a couple of years, my father has had them for years and years ago. But that was like another thing like if you don't really say what you feel you can worry about that too  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - you can really build up inside of you too. You just really don't say what you feel  -
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: - it just. That's like Jim was saying too like he said he always, usually says what he feels and he says but you can hurt someone while you're doing it but at least they'll know you're honest in what you say and truthfully, forgotten (inaudible - 0:28:02.9) it doesn't mean that much. And that's another I caught myself apologizing to Tanya because when she was suppose to come over that day she wanted to come over that day and I said forget it. I caught myself apologizing and I had mentioned it to Jim, he says if you keep on apologizing it's going to be like expected that you should always apologize.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it's really why should you, there's really no reason why you should so I thought about that too. And I meant to I was going to say I really didn't mean that apology but then I thought well I'll just let it ride (inaudible - 0:29:04.0), but I shouldn't have. Fear and worry.
COUNSELOR: Fears and worries plague you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, really.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:29:52.0). They plague you as long as you let them plague you.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, really.
COUNSELOR: Because it's not like they're from outside (inaudible - 0:30:01.6).
PATIENT: That's true, really that's the truth.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:30:03.9) face value (inaudible - 0:30:05.6).
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: It seems like you're a victim of choosing  -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: - kind of let yourself get into (inaudible - 0:30:13.5).
PATIENT: It's terrific not to though. I've experienced that too, you know. We get to, you know, some days you just figure all so what.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you know like I, you know, I've seen you much less worried  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - and it's like you can tell like if you look lighter  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - like you just felt you were bogged down.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, it's really it's gray. I remember one time just like it was really a nice day and I was just dragging along, I missed like a turn off, and then I had to really go out of my way and I just really didn't care.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I said so what maybe I'll see something I haven't seen, it really didn't bug me whereas other times I was sort of hip.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because I missed the shitty turn off  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - and it really.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's kind of like when you're feeling good things just don't bother you  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - but if you're feeling bad it's like everything bothers you.
PATIENT: Right, right, right.
COUNSELOR: That's when you're feeling good it's kind of like you bring that out more  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - into things so that things don't bother you. But when you're feeling bad you're really sensitive to some bad things  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - you know, you let them worry you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. How it can start in such a little thing, like it really can start in a little thing. Like today when ... like the other day when the man said, the art consultant said, he couldn't get any play bills  -
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: - and I just like instantaneously had a headache.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like you can make a bigger thing out of it then really was  -
PATIENT: Yeah, right, right.
COUNSELOR: - get caught up  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - to it's such a big thing whereas you know  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - a long run in your life, the fact that they do have play bills (inaudible - 0:32:03.5).
PATIENT: Yeah, right, no big deal.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:32:05.0) a difference.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: But you don't have that kind, it's hard to have it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. And why it should bother me at that point when any other point it probably, you know it wouldn't have really bothered me. In fact today it was kind of, I got, I made a couple of phone calls and I called up The Metro Advertisement Company and Theater  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - and they said yes they should be able to help me and they would call me back. Of course, they haven't called me back and I'll sit around and worry about it until they do. It was nice that they gave me some assurance that yes they could help me. But I'll just call them back is the thing that I'm going to have to do, just call them back as soon as they call me I will call back them back.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So but it really felt kind of good that like okay the problem really isn't there.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The kid in the class she's like an old woman and she's working with me on the scenery and she keeps on saying we're not going to have time, we're not going to have time and I says I know, I know. And she said well why aren't we working on it and I was like I can't because I have to watch this classroom. She just really gets upset about the whole thing. And she's really like a woman, an old woman.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And she even dresses like one.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And she's really strange and but still and she acts like an adult  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - but still she won't take any shit from nobody including the teacher which I have enjoyed. At times she gets to the point she's even disrespectful but it really doesn't bother me.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's another child it would.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because you know who she is and what type of a child she is, she's not a child she's an adult.
COUNSELOR: A lady child.
PATIENT: Right, an old lady child, which is what she is. It's like I can get along so much better with those kids who are so much more adult then the others.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: This other girl she's like a woman too. And she just really, really grown and really an adult and I really kind of envy her in a way.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then I figured (inaudible - 0:34:37.3). It's kind of nice having your parents I guess, if they, a lot of them oh they're thanking you, you've done a marvelous job blah, blah, blah and it really felt kind of good. If he hasn't been so conscientious since he started school and all this stuff.
COUNSELOR: It makes you feel good.
PATIENT: Yeah, really it felt kind of nice it really did.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:35:29.9).
PATIENT: Yeah, right. Even the kids don't realize it but the parents do. It really felt kind of good. If only Mrs. Mays hadn't showed up, obviously she was crazy, she's really out of it. She was trying to tell me that Lloyd had gone through fifth grade three times and she wanted Lloyd to (inaudible - 0:35:56.0) and I just said oh why don't you talk to the principal about this. At that point I just said forget it lady. (inaudible - 0:36:03.3) I said I don't know you go check (inaudible - 0:36:07.6). But it was really kind of nice let him handle the problem for once (inaudible - 0:36:20.6). He shouldn't even be in the job I mean he has caused so much (inaudible - 0:36:44.5).
COUNSELOR: Maybe (inaudible - 0:36:47.4).
PATIENT: That's true.
COUNSELOR: Well, some jobs are more worrisome then other jobs.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: There's also the fact (inaudible - 0:36:56.1).
PATIENT: Yeah, that's true.
COUNSELOR: And that's constant.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, right. If I had to worry about that I would worry about what I was doing in any job.
COUNSELOR: Imagine if you signed up for electronic controller?
PATIENT: Oh god. I wouldn't last a day, no way. There wouldn't be any way, no way at all, that would be unbelievable. I mean yesterday when Tanya was over there, you know after I had bombed out, and then I thought I even would liked to have seen her go  -
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: - I just felt go, you know I just felt like go. And then I was thinking about her going to Spain (inaudible - 0:38:22.9), it was really.
COUNSELOR: What was that kind of like you feeling so hard that you let yourself  -
PATIENT: Yeah, right. I was just feeling so rotten about myself. I just was feeling rotten. And then I was just going to ...
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:38:41.8).
PATIENT: I don't know what it was like, yeah kind of like it was.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It was like a hopeless feeling, like shit why even bother, it was like a hopeless feeling. And then after we experienced intercourse then she said something about patience, not patience or something, she said something like that and I just felt she's trying to make me feel good and something, I don't know it was really weird.
COUNSELOR: You know what I mean the thing she made (inaudible - 0:39:22.7)  -
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
COUNSELOR: - yeah it's probably (inaudible - 0:39:26.1).
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know, it's the kind of thing I was saying it's something you know you're not you still have worries about it, if you can be upset  -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: - (inaudible - 0:39:38.8).
PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:39:44.5).
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: To give up hope  -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: - things like worrying, it's over worrying it's making more of something that should be made of.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: It's making more of not having a reaction, it's making more (inaudible - 0:40:00.0).
PATIENT: Yeah, that's true yeah.
COUNSELOR: Do you see a similarity there?
PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Like not really making a big deal out of it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean like the first time when you tried and it didn't work  -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: - (inaudible - 0:40:15.3) able to  -
PATIENT: Yeah, right laugh it off.
COUNSELOR: - to laugh it off. Maybe if you had been in another mood you would have laughed it off.
PATIENT: That's true, that's true too, that's true.
COUNSELOR: You know all those kinds of things are subject (inaudible - 0:40:31.0), how you feel sexually (inaudible - 0:40:35.6) and they are subject.
PATIENT: It's funny how, you know like one day you can just be so relaxed and another day just so tense and nothing goes right, nothing and it's your own damn fault, it's my fault. And I knew it and I was sitting there, you know lying there consciously trying to relax and, of course, I couldn't relax because I was thinking about why I can't relax.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: You know relax, relax, relax.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:41:04.0).
PATIENT: Yeah, right, keep on telling myself you've got to relax, you've got to relax and I couldn't. All I said was you got to relax, you got to relax, this is really weird. Basically very pessimistic.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:42:10.3).
PATIENT: Yeah, right it's really rotten, really rotten. I can see why the scene with it my appearance.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Couldn't bother and stuff like that. Well, everybody is a god damn crook to me.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They're all crooks don't tell me about.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Just the tape, basically pessimistic.
COUNSELOR: Pessimistic?

COUNSELOR: Oh no not yet. I'm doing analysis (inaudible - 0:43:21.3).
PATIENT: Oh. No big hurry, huh?

PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Just try to do all the work on the computer.
PATIENT: I see.
COUNSELOR: Analysis so I can write.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: And I'll start writing when I leave.

COUNSELOR: - I will have the writing to do.
PATIENT: But the work is all compiled, at any rate at least you know where you're going.
COUNSELOR: Right. And I just have to write it up.
PATIENT: Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: What it means. (inaudible - 0:44:03.9).
PATIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah, right. Are you going to be employed while you're writing it?

COUNSELOR: Oh, I worry about it.
PATIENT: Really.

PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:45:20.6).
PATIENT: Yeah, right. But you can kind of like say for instance if you're working on a paper you can kind of cut it down to size by sitting for a couple of hours and really doing something.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And you figure well okay.
COUNSELOR: Plus the worry is too big to prevent me from doing something  -
PATIENT: That's true.
COUNSELOR: - which makes it worse.
PATIENT: Yeah, that's true. I mean something like that is so it's there it's tangible  -
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: - you can really do something about it and then well, you're happy where it's going. Should have done something about those play bills (inaudible - 0:45:53.3) get them.
