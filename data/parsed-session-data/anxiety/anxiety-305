I DID not, of course, win the Bewdley election—there
was not the least chance of that at any time. When the
Count took place at 10 a.m. on the morning after the Poll
at the County Hall, Worcester, and Chris and I arrived
in the Hall some three-quarters of an hour after this time
(at least this procedure obviated the suspense) the half-
counted ballot papers already showed indications of the
result. When this was announced I was second; but a
reasonably good second, as my final total of 8,511
votes against the 15,054 for Captain Roger Conant
showed.


Chris and I shook hands with our victorious and and affable
opponents and returned to our Committee Rooms at
Malvern for our last sorrowing reunion with my fervent
supporters, many of whom had genuinely expected that I
was going to win and were in an appropriate state of
disappointment. Then we motored back to Woodstock
in the late evening.


My thoughts once more returned to "The 
Marlborough Arms" as I underwent the gradual metamorphosis 
from my exhilarating existence as a by-election
candidate back into my previous incarnation as a
struggling innkeeper.


The idyll which I outlined at the end of Chapter Two
had not lasted for long. Though united in our aim to turn
"The Marlborough Arms" into a first class hotel,
differences in policy over the precise method of doing this

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Max paid a brief visit to Kent the day after our
"takeúover" and had arrived back in a big way two days
later with innumerable personal possessions including his
two Airedales, Nip and Tinker, and Blossom the goat,
all of whom he had insisted on keeping on the premises—the
latter being installed half way down the yard, from
which point of vantage she held herself in readiness to
butt all-comers. Thus established, he had a simple
solution to propound for the numerous problems that
beset us:


"Turn this lot out and get some decent people in.
That's what Fothergill did at Thame. What we want is a
notice outside ‘NO CHARABANCS.’ Look here, let me read
you a bit from Fothergill ..." Max Colyer-Fergusson
took <i>The Diary of an Innkeeper</i>, which had become his
<i>vade mecum</i>, out of his pocket and started to read: "Listen
to this, ‘Here I've determined not only to have proper
and properly-cooked food but to have only either intelligent,
beautiful or well-bred people to eat it.’ Doesn't he
express himself well? That's what we ought to do. Clear
out these ruddy charas. You can't mix your type of trade.
You'll soon find that out."


But this simple, straightforward philosophy of innkeeping,
appealing as it was to Max, needed the moral
courage that I did not possess. The majority of Harry
Gowing's valuable goodwill failed, admittedly, to qualify
in regard to one or the other of Mr. John Fothergill's
criteria. In some cases they failed in regard to all three.
But it was all very well to talk. Despite the pressure which
Max Colyer-Fergusson alleged himself to be applying to
his trustees, he had not yet produced any money. While
the charabanc parties, even if they were only good for
tuppenny cups of tea, at least yielded ready cash to help
along with expenses. Already, within a fortnight of taking

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To start with, our differences had been of a purely
academic character and had not affected in any way the
spirit of <i>bonhomie</i> that pervaded our efforts. The jolt out
of our Arcadian existence had, however, come on the day
just two weeks from the date on which we had taken over,
when the telephone bell at the cottage rang at about
10.30 a.m.:


"Is that Mr. Johnson?" asked the voice—an importunate
voice—at the other end.


"Yes," I said.


"You the proprietor of ‘The Marlborough Arms’?"


"Yes."


"Well, if you want to keep your customers, I'd advise
you to come along and look after your business."


"What is it?" I asked.


"Never mind. Come along and see," said the voice.
Then the receiver at the other end slammed in place.


I hesitated a moment. I had hoped for a quiet, restful
morning that particular morning.


"You'd better go along hadn't you, darling?" said
Chris. "I expect Max has done something. He's always
upsetting the staff anyway. I know that."


Reluctantly I jumped into my car and went along. I
cursed as I did so. It was as bad as the old days. Just like
general practice!


When I had arrived at "The Marlborough Arms" there
was a hushed atmosphere about the place. The two or
three locals in the snug, fat jovial middle-aged Councillor
Tommy Robinson, our milkman, garageman Jack Holly
and the one or two others were unusually silent. Our

"Don't seem as if your manager wants his trade, do it?"
summed up Tommy Robinson.


Once started, there was no stemming the flow of
<i>racontage</i> from the local customers. It seemed as if there
had been sacrilege committed—no less. In awed tones the
story was told. It had not been gone three-quarters of an
hour since four of Smith's grey and black coaches,
harbingers of the summer season, had drawn up in their
customary parking place on the street kerb in front of
"The Marlborough Arms." Their cornucopia of B'rummagemers
on spree had been unloaded into the hotel.
Then something had happened to interrupt these
auspicious proceedings. Rumours varied: some said there
had been a <i>fracas</i> in the ladies' lavatories upstairs, others
that there had been trouble about last night's beer being
served. The only certainty was that Max Colyer-Fergusson
and the leading driver, young Fred Smith, the boss's
son, had been seen in hot altercation with Max shouting,
"Get out! Get out, I tell you," as an outcome of which
the drivers had rounded up their parties and driven them
the circumference of the town round to "The King's
Arms" where our opposition had received them with
open arms.


An atmosphere of doom had hung over "The Marlborough
Arms" following this desecration of the altars
of the goddess of plenty. The only person who could not
be seen about was the perpetrator of the sacrilegious act,
this latter-day Clodius, Max Colyer-Fergusson. No one
knew what had happened to him.


It had been, in fact, an hour later before he appeared
in company with the Airedales. No sign of impending

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Hello, old boy," greeted Max Colyer-Fergusson,
"Grand morning, isn't it? Simply splendid in the Park.
Old Nip has had a hell of a time chasing rabbits. Enjoyed
herself no end, haven't you, old girl? I say, anything
wrong?"


"Wasn't there some trouble earlier in the morning?"


"If you'd call it trouble, I suppose you're right,"
agreed Max breezily. "I can't say that I had much
trouble. I went into the kitchen and found some damn
chara driver washing his filthy hands at the sink. I told
him I couldn't have it and I turned him right out. I
never allowed that sort of thing at the Hall and I'm not
going to allow it here. Strangers coming in and making
themselves at home in the kitchen—I never heard of such
a thing."


There was a certain logic in Max Colyer-Fergusson's
statement of the position. But it was not difficult to detect
the flaw in this from an hotel-keeper's point of view and I
started patiently to explain this to him. It was obvious
that the "damn chara driver" had been young Mr. Fred
Smith himself and my heart sank.


"After all," I finished my homily, "we can't run
this place as if it was our own estate."


"Nobody said we could," he replied. "Last thing I
should think of, old boy. All the same, if I'm going to
work here, it's got to be the sort of place a gentleman can
work in. Not a roadside public convenience. That's what
Fothergill was always complaining of. He wouldn't have
it at Thame and I'm not going to have it here."


"Well," I said, "I can't afford to turn away cash—not
with the expenses of all these repairs and decorations."


"Very well," said Max Colyer-Fergusson, straightening
his old Harrovian tie with a jerk, "Have it your own way
then."

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Very well," I said, "I will."


"If you don't get gentlefolk as customers," said Max,
"it will be your own look out."


"It will," I said.


"And you can jolly well run the place yourself too."


"Very well," I said, "I will."


In this way, my carefully-laid plans for my personal
life shattered, I had started, willy-nilly, to get down to
the business of hotel-keeping in a manner I had not
originally contemplated. Daily from 9 a.m. onwards I was
up at "The Marlborough Arms" to act as buffer between
Max Colyer-Fergusson and the charabanc parties.
Though, alas, the damage was done—done beyond repair
as far as Smith's coaches were concerned. Attempts at
creating a reconciliation that were generously made by
our local customers, assiduous in their defence of the
reputation of "The Marlborough Arms," were foredoomed
to the scornful treatment which they received
at the hands of the insulted party, young Mr. Fred Smith.
As every roadside publican knows, chara drivers (let
alone charabanc proprietors), the bringers of custom,
are not to be treated like that! Despite the apologies which
I proffered for the incident of the kitchen tap, Smith's
grey and black coaches, all ten of them on occasions,
instead of stopping in front of "The Marlborough Arms"
as hitherto had been their custom on their twice-weekly
appearances in Woodstock, now passed by in majestic
fashion, each in turn blowing a contumelious toot on its
musical horn as it passed the hotel, before it swept round
the triangle of Woodstock streets eventually to pull up in
front of "The King's Arms" at the opposite corner.
We were still to get our occasional charabanc parties. In
fact, we still relied on our booked coach parties for our
summer's business. But, as regards charabancs <i>en masse</i>,
the news of the unfortunate incident just retailed
spread amongst the fraternity of chara drivers and

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Following this incident there had been an uneasy
period when Max Colyer-Fergusson was still nominally
in charge, but in fact divested of real authority—for I
had felt that I could take no more chances! Despite his
declaration, he did not leave us right away. He was
obviously reluctant to abandon the career which he had
mapped out for himself. But he had set his course by the
lodestar provided by John Fothergill and once he could
no longer follow this, the barque of his good intentions
drifted aimlessly hither and thither and to and fro. His
interest in hotel-keeping became more or less desultory.
Whole hours were spent communing with Blossom, the
goat, down the yard; whole mornings out with Nip and
Tinker watching them chase rabbits down the "green
lanes" at the back of the hotel. At other times he sat in
the make-shift bar-lounge which we had created out of
Harry Gowing's draughty passage and rang bells for the
staff or murmured, "Mine's a double whiskey, please,"
to any such open-hearted, but unforeseeing, guest who
asked him to join in a drink.


From his initial pinnacle of success as our right hand
man, he had dwindled to the status of a rather troublesome
resident who had to be reminded on occasions that
the establishment could not be run for his exclusive
benefit.

This had been the state of affairs when I had left to
contest the Bewdley by-election. My departure had
meant leaving Chris to cope with the deluge of June
business pretty much on her own.

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had, in the manner I had stipulated, broken away
from my electioneering with the intention of spending
two days in Woodstock for the Ascot Week parties. I had
fixed to come back on Tuesday evening and to stay
over until Thursday morning. I had felt like a visitor
from another world, when Tuesday midnight, following
a drive of forty-odd miles back from Malvern, I walked in.
Cups, saucers, plates, vegetable dishes, pots and pans—clean
and dirty, but mostly dirty—were occupying every
available standing place in the kitchen of "The Marlborough
Arms." In the middle stood Chris, scarcely
visible behind the mounds of egg containers on the table,
directing with frenzied determination the operations of
her small army of helpers—Mrs. Walters, our cook, at
the gas stove, Mrs. Desmond and Mrs. Rowley, local
washers-up, at the two sinks, while our artist friend,
Valda Vaughan, who had been doing our new hotel sign
and our wall map, had put aside her brushes for the
occasion, and was running round in ever narrowing circles.


"Hello," I said, "Busy?"


"It looks like it, doesn't it?" said Chris.


My remark must, indeed, have sounded a fatuous one.


"Can't I help?"


"No thanks, we're managing," said Chris.


"But I've come back specially."


"I shouldn't have bothered."


"Anyway, here I am. What can I do?"


"Nothing," repeated Chris, "we'll manage." And that
was all the response I could get.


For half an hour or so I stood about foolishly in the
kitchen while Mrs. Desmond, standing at one sink,
regaled the company with accounts of her eight children
with particular reference to their various modes of entry
into this earthly vale of tears and Mrs. Rowley at the other
vied with her in descriptions of her own attentions to
her husband who was a martyr to rheumatism. Gradually

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"We'll manage," said Chris firmly.


Realizing eventually the futility of these proceedings
I had gone to bed.


But the same thing had happened next morning when,
with everyone else, I got up at five-thirty hoping to be
useful in preparation for the breakfast parties who were
booked to fill all the available seating space in the hotel.
Chris, full of her desire for independence, was determined
to keep control. More than that, she seemed determined
to do everything single-handed! Meanwhile I hung about
in the same frustrated fashion as on the previous night.
Mrs. Desmond appeared at 7 a.m. and started to weigh
in with an account of "the good time" which she had had
with her third, while Mrs. Rowley, who appeared to have
been up all night putting flannels on Mr. Rowley's
aching joints, came in half an hour later.


But to listen to further bulletins on these subjects
was more than I could stand. I had therefore stationed
myself in front of the hotel, where I had the honour of
welcoming the first party, the formidable-looking members
of the North Bromwich Women's Constitutional
Association and settling them in the main dining room
where I attempted to assuage their immediate clamour
for bacon and eggs. Unfortunately, while this was
happening, a second party led by the landlady of "The
Bird in Hand," Upper Fledgley, had sat themselves
unnoticed in the upstairs party room and were also starting
to "create" through not having instant service. I did my
best to placate these importunate people too and to inform
Chris, still furiously frying eggs over the kitchen stove,
of the urgency of the situation (to be greeted by, "Oh,

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had had no report of the <i>denouement</i> of this unpromising
situation since the time I had left Woodstock. And,
now, as we drove back from the count at Worcester, I
concluded from Chris's terse remarks that the encounter
between her and the ladies' charabanc parties had not
been a satisfying one; but I thought it better to leave it
at that.


(3)


It was 10.30 p.m., just after closing time, when we
reached Woodstock. As we walked in, "The Marlborough
Arms" seemed quiet and gloomy with no one but the
supercilious Mr. Loveil to wish us a quick "Good-night"
before he retreated upstairs.


Throughout the drive home I had been making good
resolutions. It had been pretty sporting of Chris to have
carried on as she had done. She had behaved somewhat
unreasonably when I had taken the trouble to motor
back late at night to help her. But wives were, I supposed,
like that. All the same there was no one like Chris to go
to when you were really in a hole. It had been damned
good of her to tackle the party catering without business
experience. Perhaps she had kept them waiting a bit.
But whatever sort of muddle she had got into, she had
done her best about it. It had been hard work for her and
the least I could do, on my side, was not to make too
many criticisms. In fact, by the time we reached "The
Marlborough Arms" I had decided that tonight I would

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, with the unpredictability of women, Chris
who was usually the first to put off anything of a serious
nature, now strode into the hotel in determined fashion
and headed straight for the office—which even at the
height of summer, maintained something of its winter
chilliness—where she took out her account books and
started to get down to figures without further ado.


It took Chris nearly ten minutes to finish her figures
while I watched in silence.


"There you are," said Chris at last, pushing the books
over towards me with a flourish, "Now you can look at
them."


"That's all right, darling," I said, making my gesture
of abnegation. "Let's leave the books until tomorrow and
talk of something else. I expect you're tired."


"You're not interested in what I've done, are you?"
said Chris in challenging fashion.


"It's not that, darling," I protested. I knew myself
and I knew Chris and I knew the most likely outcome to
a discussion of the accounts.


"Well, what is it then?" persisted Chris. "You can't
think of anything else except politics, that's the trouble
with you."


There would clearly be trouble if I didn't look at the
books. My decision weakened. Having denied myself
thus far, an irresistible urge now seized me to look at
the figures and see just what Chris had done while
I had been away. Perhaps, I thought, I could give
a brief "once over" and leave any comment until tomorrow.


I sat down at the desk and started to pore over the array
of figures which Chris had drawn up. Chris had obviously
worked hard at them.

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Unfortunately, once given rows of figures, I automatically
had to go right through and check them to the
bitter end. I managed to skate over fifteen shillings
deficit in the reckoning of one party and thirty shillings
in another without batting an eyelid—or I was aware that
Chris was watching my actions intently. It was not until
on one item I found a whole four pounds difference
between the reckoning on the day book and the amount
of money that had been banked, that my self-control
deserted me. I reached across for a piece of paper and a
pencil and started making a detailed check-up. For the
moment, I forgot Chris was there.


"Well, what's the matter?" broke in Chris ominously.


"Oh, nothing, darling."


"Oh, yes there is," said Chris.


"Well, you're only about four pounds out in your
reckoning for Wednesday, my darling."


"Oh, am I?" answered Chris. "I suppose I can't do
anything right?"


"Yes, of course you can," I replied with vain attempts
at appeasement. "Still, it doesn't matter." I didn't know
what else I could say.


"Oh, yes it does," replied Chris—once it was under
way, Christiane's temperament tended to work itself up
to a crescendo like a Labrador gale—"You start to talk
about the work I've been doing for you, while you've been
away neglecting your business; and then you say
it doesn't matter. You can show me where I'm
wrong."


Unfortunately Chris was not good at seeing where
she was wrong. While on my side I soon found myself so
heavily bogged in the figures in front of me that I was
unable to explain where the error did lie. I felt myself
losing face rapidly.


"You're bound to be wrong, darling," I insisted
unwisely.

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Oh, yes," said Chris. "Everything I do is wrong.
Well, I'm fed up. You can stay home and look after your
own hotel in future instead of gallivanting about with
your politics and then you can do things the right way for
yourself. I shall be the one that goes away next time. And
you can look after these charabanc women and clean the
lavatories out at two in the morning like I've done this
month. Then you'd probably make a few mistakes in
your own accounts."


Chris was obviously overstrung after her busy weeks
of work. I more than half suspected that she had provoked
the row in order to have the opportunity of telling me
what she thought of me.


"Well, listen to this," Chris continued—and now she
was calm and collected and deadly serious. "If you're
going to do what you want, then so am I. You want to
have your career. Well, so do I. I won't let you down now;
I've promised to work in the place until we can afford a
manager to carry on; then I'm going to have my career."


"Yes, you can smile if you like," continued Chris—
I had evidently betrayed my scepticism at the idea of
Chris working at anything consistently enough to produce
a career—"But I'd be a famous dress-designer or something
better than that now if I'd had your education."
(Chris had only the vaguest idea about my education!)
"You think I can't do it, don't you? But I shall do something
big yet, when I've finished in this place. You wait
and see. So don't think that I'm going to slave here for
you for the rest of my days."


"Of course I don't, my darling," I replied.


But Chris, having said her say, flounced out of the
room, leaving me to my own devices and the assortment
of figures in front of me.


Naturally, I found the mistake as soon as Chris had
gone. I made to follow after her, but then thought better
of it. Our conversation had gone beyond figures.

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Pensively I started to rummage among the papers on
the desk. As I did so, my eye was attracted by a scrappy
bit of notepaper, headed in illiterate handwriting "The
Bird in Hand, Little Fledgley." I picked it up and read:
<blockquote>
<p>
Dear Madam,
</p>
<p>
Owing to your bad food and extremely folty service we have
decided never to call at your hotel again. Your eggs and bacon
were not worth sixpence never mind the 2s. 6d. you charged.
</p>
</blockquote>
Oh, my God! But, as if this wasn't enough, there was
another letter underneath it from the Secretary of the
North Bromwich Women's Constitutional Association
demanding in more restrained language a rebate of 6d.
per head as they had not been supplied with marmalade
according to their menu submitted. While yet again
beneath this was one from Mr. J. F. Poleaxe, Managing
Director of Messrs. J. F. Poleaxe &amp; Co., wholesale and
retail meat merchants, whose staff party had been entertained
for thirty dinners: this, clearly written more in
sorrow than in anger, took the form of a homily on the
necessity for efficient business management in the running
of a catering establishment.


Dear Madam,


Owing to your bad food and extremely folty service we have
decided never to call at your hotel again. Your eggs and bacon
were not worth sixpence never mind the 2s. 6d. you charged.


After reading these through, I remained gazing in
front of me in dazed fashion. I scarcely dared visualize
what had taken place that morning when, despairing of
being of use, I had left Chris in control at "The Marlborough
Arms." I could only vaguely imagine the clash
of personality that had taken place between her and the
Birmingham ladies. My mind wandered back to the
vision of Chris furiously frying bacon and eggs in the
kitchen and, exhausted by the day's events, I must have
dozed off. For there I was in the kitchen still standing
idly by, watching Mrs. Desmond and Mrs. Rowley wash
up—Mrs. Desmond was still telling of "the good time"
which she had had with her third—when at the door
that opened in from the yard, there appeared the face

"Look here, miss. You've promised us marmalade."


Chris tried to argue. But when she started to do so,
the Chairman of the North Bromwich Women's Constitutional
Association had pulled a piece of paper out
of her bag and there it was in black and white—in my
own handwriting—on "Marlborough Arms" notepaper,
"Marmalade" at the bottom of the menu, there was no
getting away from it. Chris cursed out loud: it was a good
job she didn't seem to see me there. And everyone had to
interrupt what they were doing in order to hunt out the
marmalade pots and dishes and fill these for the benefit
of the North Bromwich Women's Constitutional Association
while their Chairman watched the proceedings in
order to make quite certain that it was marmalade that
went into the dishes. Then in the middle of it there
appeared at the other kitchen door that led up the back
stairs another Fury, more florid and more furious than
the first—as it shortly turned out, the landlady of the
"Bird in Hand," Little Fledgley.


"Look here, young woman," began the landlady of the
"Bird in Hand." "It's now half past eight. We were
promised our breakfast at 8.15 and it's now half past..."


She had meant to go on. But two of these women at
the same time were too much for Chris. Looking from
the red face of the Chairman of the Women's Constitutional
Association to the red face of the landlady of
the "Bird in Hand," Chris obviously saw red herself.


"Get out!" she yelled. "Get out of this kitchen, both
of you! You'll get what you want if you wait for it!"


The Chairman of the Women's Constitutional Association
spluttered; while the landlady of the "Bird in Hand"
blenched and her jaw dropped and her teeth started to

"My God, if only we could get some decent people in!"


I came to my senses with a start. I could not be certain
whether I had imagined Chris saying this or whether
I had said the words myself.


Anyway it was getting late. I looked at my watch and it
was 12.30a.m. The office of "The Marlborough Arms"
was decidedly chilly by now. It was high time for me to
go to bed.
