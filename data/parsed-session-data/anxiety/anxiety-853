CLIENT: (Sighs)
THERAPIST: (Coughs)
CLIENT: So on of the things about my trip to Arizona was—I want to talk to you—(inaudible [00:00:19) like secondarily was this for my (inaudible [00:00:22) about being depressed and about like how our parents react or don't react or freak out. And also I was thinking I wanted to know if he had a different experience of our parents because they were, I guess, more open with him or less anxious or, you know, whatever. [00:00:55]
I wasn't sure how I was going to make this happen...I was kind like maybe over dinner or—on Saturday, right before I was leaving the house, there was this, like, awesome segue way to talking about it a little bit, but I'm like, "I have to leave and meet friends" but... Like I sort of brought up that I was feeling really depressed and (inaudible [00:01:25) like, "You have to talk to my psychiatrist, I just got my medications adjusted, yes, I'm seeing a therapist." Like, da, da, da, da, da. 
And (inaudible [00:01:38) I was actually more vocal about it than my brother which—I don't know, he was in a kind of quiet mood. But when I came back in the evening, I just, like, kind of—to get ready for—brought up the topic. [00:01:52]
THERAPIST: Um hm.
CLIENT: Um (pause) and it was kind of weird because I realized we don't actually (pause) like for all kind of like for all the openness, like generally—like (inaudible [00:02:13) openness around the (inaudible [00:02:14) issues in my family, but we don't really talk about them. Like...so I hadn't really thought about that until we were talking earlier and we were talking (pause) so well one thing that like was interesting is that he (inaudible [00:02:43) my mother being kind of anxious and really intense on things and my sister-in-law often comments on that. And of course, it is easier for her because it is not her mom but (inaudible [00:02:57) well why don't you just do X, Y and Z and she feels much more comfortable just saying no to my mom or not responding or just like, I don't know, like...I mean, for whatever reason, she is like (inaudible [00:03:23) easier time like setting boundaries with my mom. My mom is slightly more respectful of them. [00:03:33]
So, it was just kind of, you know, I mean for (inaudible [00:03:38) so (breathes deeply)—um, because I wanted to know if my mom had always been this anxious, like if she had been like this when we were growing up. And none of us could really remember. I kind of like—I don't remember her being anxious when I was growing up. And thinking about it, I used to—like among my friends, my mom was like the chill mom compared to other people's moms because I didn't have a curfew ever. And like if I was home, like if I—like after say, elementary school, if I didn't come home right away, she would figure I was at a friend's house playing, because I was. And, you know, like there were friends across the street and up the street and like my other friend kind of down the street. So like we were just kind of there. And my friend Zoe's mom would call—started calling all of Zoe's friends' mothers if she was late home from school. And I would always think, A, she's just at my house—like that's what happens half the time. Also it was embarrassing and my mom always found it kind of odd so she was chill about that. She wasn't worried about me going to Prom with a guy—she's just like (inaudible [00:05:11), she didn't freak out. And like when I went off to camp she's usually chill. She would write me all these letters and stuff, but... [00:05:21]
So my brother kind of remembers it as being like a year or two after I graduated that my mom started getting really anxious about things. So she joined a (inaudible [00:05:38) choir company and was basically doing work backstage and really liked it but also would get very intense about certain aspects of it. And it is also when she started renovating, you know, stripping wallpaper and repainting and doing all these things in our house. Well, she did that when I was in college, too, but a couple like bigger bursts of it (pause) and then when she is working at this job at this store, she would get really, like, intense and fixated about making displays. Or she would just get super focused on something at work and, I don't know, it is hard to describe. She was just very tightly wound while working. [00:06:38]
Um, but also when we were growing up, my parents didn't really socialize with people very much. 
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: They pretty much all—they used to—they had bridge parties when we were both younger—
THERAPIST: Like playing bridge?
CLIENT: Play bridge together. Without (inaudible [00:06:59), like that was part of the—there really was kind of like a housewives welcoming club sort of thing and that was part of it. And then people stopped playing bridge, so that kind of went away. [00:07:19]
And I can remember, I think once, my mom having a friend over for dinner because it was a very big—it was unusual and my mom was super stressed about it and got mad at me for cutting bread the wrong way. It was just like a whole shebang. But, yes, and they still don't—the socializing they do now is around a bridge group and their group and my mom's friends from (inaudible [00:07:52).
THERAPIST: Their what?
CLIENT: it's the group of parents with kids with mental illnesses. Which came out one of the time my brother was in the hospital.
THERAPIST: I think you've [interposing].
CLIENT: Yes, yes, so they have gone traveling and—but they don't really—I think we were talking about does my dad have friends who aren't co-workers, former co-workers. I don't think so. I don't know. I am also not convinced that if they had friends that they would necessarily say anything to us. 
THERAPIST: If your parent—if your dad had friends, that your dad's friends would say anything to you? That your parents—I'm— [00:08:44]
CLIENT: I feel like if my parents were, say, going over to someone's like a friend's house for dinner or having someone over, it is really up in the air if they would say anything about it. Does that make sense?
THERAPIST: Yep.
CLIENT: Um (pause) I know, like, just again I think of other parents of friends of mind who do more socializing, especially Zoe and Jamie's parents, they both do like—Jamie's mom does really intense formal socializing where it is like a dinner party and there is a lot of intense manners and things. And it is all kind of weirdly icy [ph] and terrifying. And then Zoe's parents, they have done like a sort of let your friends come over and make gingerbread houses at their house thing for years. It is very casual. [inaudible [00:09:50] just kind of come over. And then also like both of them—both Zoe's parents grew up here so like extended family everywhere. But obviously I don't have extended family nearby and actually Jamie— [00:10:13]
THERAPIST: You said you don't have—
CLIENT: I don't have extended family nearby. 
THERAPIST: All right.
CLIENT: And actually Jamie doesn't either, but um, so what I imagine is this last time he was in a mental hospital he was actually really worried that my mom was going to have a breakdown because she was so tense and worried and just freaked out. She would never mention it. Like my memory of that time was her calling and telling me she was really happy that she had found my brother in the hospital and that she had booked, like, an extended stay hotel and was really happy because they had a complimentary wine and cocktail—or wine and like (pause) nibbly food hour. So she got free wine and thought that was great. [00:11:16]
So from my point of view, I was like, oh it is kind of weird that she is this excited about free wine, but whatever. You know, she's chiller, she seemed okay. So it was kind of where—for my brother to be like, "Yes, I thought she was going to lose her mind."
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: And I was thinking—then I was thinking it was like I don't think I ever really talked to my brother about him being in a hospital, like any other times. Um (pause) because we were talking about this exhibit and this artist [inaudible [00:11:56] voluntarily [inaudible [00:11:58] [interposing]
THERAPIST: The Japanese artist. [00:11:59]
CLIENT: Yes, the Japanese artist. And I mentioned how I thought that was really, like, scary to me. And my brother, his response is like, "Well, even it was like—I've got to tell you, they treat you pretty well in the mental hospital, like, structure, get your meals, you don't have to do anything and he is like, if you are on a lot of drugs, it is kind of nice." And then I found out that Tricia's mother I heard [00:12:29] spending [inaudible [00:12:31] of her life in a mental hospital.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Which I didn't know.
THERAPIST: Do you know what she had?
CLIENT: Yes, I knew that she had major mental health problems. She was bi-polar and maybe [inaudible [00:12:46]. But mostly bi-polar. And—so her mother—
THERAPIST: Including [inaudible [00:12:53]?
CLIENT: Yes. Her mother, when Tricia was like seven, so they were living in Texas—and her mother had some kind of breakdown and left.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Moved to Arizona where her mother was and never came back.
THERAPIST: Oh, I had no idea.
CLIENT: Yes. It is kind of craz—like when she talks about it, it is kind of this mix-up like she has obviously made whatever peace with it and also kind of like, "Isn't this wacky?" But every time I am like, "Your mother just left. Boom." (Pause) Um, and so her mother—Tricia's mother lived with her grandmother until her grandmother died and Tricia's mom was not able to live on her own for various reasons, so as Tricia put it, the option was to have her mother live with her, which wouldn't work because—for many reasons, or some kind of institution. You know. And she was—her mother was in there for about a decade. Yes. [00:14:14]
I also—remember correctly—Tricia didn't really see her mother or her family in Arizona for a couple of years and then what would happen is she and her older brother would sort of be put on a Greyhound and sent to Arizona like once a year. Mostly to see—like—my impression is that mostly (pause) like she wasn't really—she didn't really have a maternal relationship with her mother. And that she sort of mostly was seeing other family members like her grandmother. (Pause) Yet in some ways it is kind of surprising that—like, you know, two people with parents who have [inaudible [00:15:14]. But yes, [inaudible [00:15:20] Seth are kind of like in my head, like being in the hospital is so scary to me, like the idea of it, that I couldn't really conceive of what it was like for him. So I'm glad it is not horrible. [00:15:42]
So Tricia had, like she had sort of more to say than my brother. And her thought was that some of this might be just like my parents' generation and their ideas of how to be a good parent. And sort of the idea of being slightly distant to encourage your kids to be independent. (Pause) I'm not sure if I agree with her, but she remembers people saying things like, you know, like when her parents would do something like—I don't know—like, "Don't pick up your kid so much. They are going to be spoiled and never leave the house." Or, "Don't coddle them", or "Don't—there is sort of the fear of spoiling. But by spoiling, sometimes it is things like letting your kids run around in the front yard and play as opposed to how what I would think of as spoiling as like indulging their every whim. 
THERAPIST: Right. [00:17:11]
CLIENT: And Tricia also commented that that is something that she—she said that she has been sort of doing the same thing that I have been doing with her dad, which is like trying to get a deeper connection and trying to sort of like have a closer relationship and just having it not work. I think her comment was, like, that I am there trying to communicate with my mom and understand what is going on and like, explain things and talk about it and my mom—it is not [inaudible [00:18:09] that she rejects it, it is more like nothing happens. You know?
THERAPIST: I have the impression of a (pause) really, like a gulf between the two of you that—
CLIENT: My mother and I?
THERAPIST: Yes. That has never really been acknowledged and had to do with her (pause) not really being aware and in touch with (pause) a lot of what was going on inside of you, how you felt, what you wanted, things you thought, and which you mostly didn't know was there either because (pause) maybe you didn't know (pause) didn't have a feel for the type of connection that was missing with her. [00:19:43]
CLIENT: Yes. I mean it is one of those—yes—like (pause) I don't know it just didn't really—really seem like—like at that time it just seemed normal, like I'm kind of like, "Sure, that is..." Lots of people [inaudible [00:20:12] had problems with their parents or—
THERAPIST: Like you and your brother are reflecting for, I guess, one of the first times in your 30s together about whether your mom was anxious when you were a kid? [00:20:29]
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: I guess I find that striking and—another thing—I may be wrong because clearly I was not there and you two were there—
CLIENT: (Laughter)
THERAPIST: (Chuckles) And she was really anxious. I know that there are ways—things that inaudible [00:20:50] some of the things you described, like sexuality, like didn't seem worried about you guys getting into sort of trouble, in a way.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: So I do hear you about that stuff and that all makes sense to me in terms of other things you have said about her, but (pause) in terms of, like, your emotional life and (pause) things you struggled with in that way, like emotionally and maybe socially too, or that (pause) sort of going on in that sphere for your parents or in the family (pause). My impression is that has always made her terribly anxious and that she was like miles and miles and miles away from being able to acknowledge that. [00:21:56]
CLIENT: Yes. I mean, so—Part of—I think—in looking back is also—since the narrative I have of my mom—like [inaudible [00:22:12] like when I was a teenager and in college, was like as if everyone is always like, "Your mom is so chill."
THERAPIST: Right. [00:22:23]
CLIENT: "It's so awesome that she is not worried about these bazillion things."
THERAPIST: Right
CLIENT: And we didn't ask her anything. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So for a long time I have kind of felt like, well, getting in screaming arguments—I don't hate my mom and she has really been great on these things, therefore I guess we have a good relationship.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Um (pause) you know, and also like having several friends who are estranged from their families or have had crazy, intense problems with their parents, I have kind of voiced [ph [00:23:24] well, so I don't have that problem.
THERAPIST: Um hm. 
CLIENT: So I am not having these crazy problems, then it must be okay. Does that make sense?
THERAPIST: Yes. 
CLIENT: Um—
THERAPIST: This is what problems look like. I don't have those; things must be okay.
CLIENT: Yes. And it is kind of like, well, I don't know and then it is kind of like I don't know, like when I would think I wanted to go see my mom, mostly what I think about is, well, but at least we are not (pause)—I have had this like, well, I guess we are close enough. We don't fight. We don't have these kind of big fights. And like most of the things that my friends would bitch about hiding from their parents, "My mom will never understand that I'm gay" it was always like, "My parents don't care." Um (pause) so yes, it has taken awhile to kind of see that while it is true that my mom has done these sort of like actions that are good—
THERAPIST: Um hm. [00:24:48]
CLIENT: Um (pause) they were sort of more like actions than like, emotional action. Does that make sense? 
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Like, we didn't fight—we'd have a fight [ph [00:25:12] about me being queer which was great—we didn't really have a conversation about it, either, like I told her and she said that she already knew. She thought that I was already and that was pretty much it. At one point she asked if I wanted her to join PFLAG and I said, "No" that just—I was sort of so overwhelmed that she wasn't—I [inaudible [00:25:39] telling her PFLAG is mostly for parents who are freaking out—
THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:25:42]
CLIENT: In part because [inaudible [00:25:46] they were kind of like, "Mom, Dad, go to PFLAG, get some brochures, talk to people, Jesus." 
THERAPIST: Right (chuckles).
CLIENT: But yes, like she has never really talked to me about it—like didn't really ask—when I wasn't dating women, generally ask about it. And they knew a lot of people whose parents' were then like, "Oh, so you're not—so you're straight now?" Mom never said that when I was dating [inaudible [00:26:2] she never said, "Oh, so you're a lesbian now?" Because we used to talk about it. And I think I am focusing on sort of the big dramatic problems. (Pause) It would be much easier to kind of ignore this, yes, gulf between my mother and I. [00:26:54]
The other thing is—that I never really talked—which rather I have talked about before—is doctors [ph [00:27:07] people who have been like, "You're bi-polar because you are mixed race." 
THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:27:12]
CLIENT: So we have both talked about that a lot.
THERAPIST: Right. Sure.
CLIENT: And how it is really annoying and crazy. 
THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:27:20]
CLIENT: [Whispering] Oh, God, every time. Um (pause) And sort of like Ross [ph [00:27:31] and I talked about that because we are like, "I don't feel that way." We actually—when I was like 19 or 20, somewhere around that—no, that was younger. I guess I was 16 or 17 and he was like 19-ish. Um (pause) when he went to Dartmouth he sort of developed more of [inaudible [00:28:00] identity. So there was like a students of color something and there was like even a group for black students and Asian students and then there was the mixed race group which my brother was in and you saw [inaudible [00:28:20]. And he was like, you know, initially he was really uncomfortable because everyone else was having these like, you know, very strong, unified message of like, "We are this." And well, in this group there is people who are a whole bunch of things. But he also felt like together they were kind of able to connect more deeply. Because [inaudible [00:28:52] ] like on the surface like, Asian Pride, and never get beyond that.
THERAPIST: I see. [00:28:59] 
CLIENT: Well he felt like they don't have to—
THERAPIST: They would have to start with were we non [inaudible [00:29:04]
CLIENT: Yes, where we sort of like paper over things.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Yes, it's funny. I remember talking about that and [inaudible [00:29:12] came off maybe a year ago—it was some brunch for one of my brother's friend's birthday and there was someone who lives in Arizona now who had been part of that group and he brought it up and how like inspiring it was and how meaningful—and also a separate couple at the table—where inter-racial couples and having kids was all kind of played [ph [00:29:39]. 
So the other thing which I really haven't discussed here was how upset and angry my mom gets over the idea of being criticized—of her parenting being criticized in therapy. Like (pause) it is just like it is funny because that is one of the biggest, crazy irrational outburst that she has over anything is that idea. [00:30:20]
And my brother definitely was like, "Yes, that happens." I think he sort of experienced it first because the guy [inaudible [00:30:38] who said that he is bi-polar because he was mixed-race also blamed my mom. It was kind of like a [inaudible [00:30:44]. So (pause) I don't know if that set the tone for how my mom thought about her kids and mental health, but it was a really disastrous interaction in a bazillion ways.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: And those were two components of it. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And she is still really angry about that.
THERAPIST: What was the criticism of her?
CLIENT: It was a little confusing. They didn't really—I wasn't totally following the "You are bi-polar because you are bi-racial", but the main sort of thrust of it was sort of like being black and being white are warring cultural personality, everything. And that (pause) my mother—so—and therefore, also my mother is representing whiteness and my, Seth [ph [00:31:53] and I are actually black, so she felt to properly form—she was negatively effecting our racial identities by people. And it was kind of sort of—it was just kind of weird like, "Your mom is to blame for you not being black enough" thing.
THERAPIST: Which is to blame for you developing bi-polar disorder?
CLIENT: Yes, because what should have happened is that (pause) you can't identify as mixed race because that is like incidental things and so we were both denying our true racial heritage, which is black. And that we were sort of using—claiming to be mixed race as a way to distance ourselves from blackness. Which is a thing that many people do, but that wasn't what was happening and it also doesn't make you bi-polar (chuckles). 
THERAPIST: No, it doesn't (chuckles). Oh, my God.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:33:08]
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: (Pause) Do you have a (pause) kind of corresponding anxiety—like worry, anxiety—about me saying things that (pause) are or sound like criticisms of your mom and her parenting? 
CLIENT: I think I do. It is really frustrating because I find myself—and it not just with you, it is a whole lot of people—sort of being, "Well, but no" while also agreeing. Like kind of wanting to defend her, but also agreeing with the criticism at the same time. (Pause)
I guess, like, even though I know she is not actually feeling this—like the idea that if she knew she was being criticized, she would be extremely upset and hurt, so it makes it hard to listen to the criticism even when I agree with it. [00:35:00]
THERAPIST: That makes a lot of sense to me and I wonder if (pause) part of the way you both always dealt with this—at least in my mind, sort of gulf—(pause) has been to have this kind of fantasy that you are totally on the same page.
CLIENT: My mom and I?
THERAPIST: Um hm. Like unquestionably. 
CLIENT: Yes, I think so. Because we are on the same page conceptually for a lot of things.
THERAPIST: Yes, sure.
CLIENT: But emotionally we are not. (Pause) It definitely feels weird to be like—to think—I would rather that my mom is open and accepting of who I am, but I don't know how she feels about it beyond that.
THERAPIST: Um hm. 
CLIENT: I feel like although it is really horrible when parents are negative towards their children about being queer, at least it is like—it is usually a ton of emotional response. Like there is all these things—I was worried that—I am worried you will never get married or that you are gay or [inaudible [00:37:26] like it is usually these super emotional, crazy, intense arguments (pause). It is like we never had, I guess, what the positive version of that would be.
THERAPIST: Um hm. (Pause) Yes, the way she was accepting about it was sort of great so far as it went, but it wasn't the same as hearing a lot of supportive things and having her ask, like, you know, what it was like figuring that out or how it played out in your life or, I don't know, whatever else.
CLIENT: Yes. And I always—I also could feel—I do feel weird complaining about that, I guess, because I have a hard time describing what is the other part. Like, you met the goal of being supporting, but then there is this big other part they don't really—I guess the other one is like, "Hey, mom" you know, "why don't you talk to me about being gay?" She would just be like, "I don't understand. I said that was fine." And then there wouldn't really be anything else. [00:38:59]
THERAPIST: The crux [ph [00:39:00] is that, you know, that is sort of where the gulf is—or one—I mean, just being gay [interposing [00:39:08] important thing, obviously, but I wonder if some of it—I don't know—I don't know how much you sort of feel really you are afraid of like the feelings that would come up in that and then the emotional stuff that would have made her anxious or the potential differences, you know? Because it might have been in some of those sorts of specifics that differences emerged between you? [00:39:38]
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: I don't know. I mean some of the stuff that we talked about has sort of made me imagine that it very anxious and even kind of paranoid about your feelings at times with your emotional life. And there are other things like (pause) absolutely, some of your brother's experience was horrible [inaudible [00:40:07] psychologist, whatever, mental health person—and that that certainly [inaudible [00:40:10] feeling. My hunch is that this worry about being criticized by therapists goes well beyond that one event and that that has something to do with somebody getting between you and she. [00:40:27]
CLIENT: Yes. And—
THERAPIST: And that sort of like—(pause) like tearing you apart in some way.
CLIENT: Yes. So, I mean, I think also part of that was her concern about raising mixed race kids. So, like—it is kind of—I mean, it is always a huge thing to people. Like one in particular that I always hear about interracial relationships is, "What about the children? The poor, suffering, confused forever children?" And I know it was a concern of hers—[inaudible [00:41:19] talk about it later, like a lot later. So they had folks—like how to raise a strong black child, how to raise a black child in like, you know, positive whatever, and she (pause) was very careful to make sure that I had dolls that were black and that my brother had—yes, he had dolls too, but other things like she wanted to make sure that—
THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:41:52]
CLIENT: He actually had dolls [inaudible [00:41:52], but also action figures. [inaudible [00:41:58] was an Eskimo doll, but and like in our books, like some of the kids books, she was like, okay, let's have—yes. Diversity. And (pause) when my brother went to college she would also walk like—she went to the bus stop—it would send him to—she would always want to stand there to see the bus go and she would always look really worried. And finally I was like, "Mom, what the hell is in the bus?" Like what was going to happen? And she is like—and her concern was of my brother being harassed for being a young black man. And then she talked a little bit about how—well she never said any of this to us when we were growing up. 
THERAPIST: Okay. (Chuckles)
CLIENT: So she's like, "Oh, yes, well, you know"—it's all these things about being a young black man and society and blah, blah, blah, and I'm concerned that maybe you didn't get enough of this information from your father and it's [inaudible [00:42:58]. This whole thing. And I was like, "Wow, I had no idea you were doing that, Mom."
THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:43:08] clearly is there, there that she had thought about, worried about, done things about, that you didn't know. [00:43:15]
CLIENT: Yes. I also wonder why—sort of like, why didn't you just say it?
THERAPIST: Right. [inaudible [00:43:27]
CLIENT: You know?
THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:43:32] for now. We'll talk more tomorrow.
