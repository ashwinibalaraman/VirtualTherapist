The only significant change in my condition, as compared to
that (condition) of last March, or the previous March (1971),
is that I am two and one-half stones heavier as a consequence
of taking the Priadel and Surmontil medications. It is a condition
which is unimaginable to those who, (fortunately for them)
are uninitiated in the tribulations of what is blithely called, by
doctors, <i>depression</i>.


Never in my entire life have I known a word which is used
with less justification to describe a condition! Each day is a
severe battle with no release. No joy, optimism or confidence
fills oneself; one is immersed in a jug of absolute hell.


The distinction between <i>endogenous</i> (i.e., psychotic) and
<i>reactive</i> or <i>involutional</i> (i.e., neurotic) depression is based largely
on psychology. If psychology is to make a positive contribution to
the problem of mental illness, then it is ipso facto necessary that
psychology recognises the biochemical nature of the brain.


It is sometimes possible to see the one in another; it is
sometimes possible to see neither in the one and both in the other;
here, however, we are in the realm of fact and not in the supermarket
discussing self and environment.


It is essential that prospective psychiatric social workers do
not observe the <i>allegro</i> or the <i>marina</i>--both incidentally, products
of British Leyland--as it were--Freud/Jung/Adler-Stokes.


It is my solemn aspiration to write, when, and if, this illness
is finally a thing of the past, at least in its recent virulent form,
a work about what it feels like to be subjected to recurrent long
attacks of so-called manic-depressive psychosis. I would like to
try to write an unashamedly honest account of the day-to-day

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048403-I00010&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However while I want to write an account from the inside,
and therefore obviously subjectively, of what it is really like to
be a victim of this terrible disease, I also want to parody human
reaction to sickness, especially mental illness. Without in any way
wishing to presume to the art of Kafka, I would nevertheless
like to take as my model <i>Metamorphosis</i>. (Could it be self-inflicted
ostracism?)


To be stricken by blindness is not an enviable condition.
But the handicap is apparent; it is "visible" to others; it invites
a measure of sympathy and understanding. Moreover, it does not
handicap the other senses; indeed, it serves to reinforce them as
compensation. It is to fall victim, out of the blue, of an illness
such as endogenous depression is to become a "half-person"; to
suffer, for months on end sometimes, a disease so all-encompassing,
so ubiquitous, at least to the "subject," that it has no
boundaries. Yet it remains largely nonapparent, nonvisible to
the outsider. When it at last becomes apparent, it is greeted,
not with the understanding extended to the blind, but with derision
and scorn and rebuke, manifested in such retorts as "pull yourself
together;" "work-shy;" "neurotic," and so on, ad infinitum.
Finally, usually, it may invite indifference!


Consequently the victim suffers doubly. His suffering is beyond
descriptions which suffice to relate "ordinary physical illness."
Yet, he has probably sinned less than most. He may become
stigmatised, or he may simply feel the psychological taint of
stigma, in addition to the physiological pain of the illness.
To all intents and purposes, it is largely irrelevant to the patient
whether the former or latter stigma prevails.


I would like people to know what it is suddenly to find one
day that one's reason and intellect have vanished, one's mental
capacity has diminished, one's physical and sexual interest has
been reduced to zero. Consequently one's self-confidence and self-respect
disappear, until, within a few days, one adopts the
person of a total nervous wreck, and one greets even the smallest
action with the utmost trepidation, interpreting it as a personal

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048403-I00011&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I vividly recall one example. While I was in the hospital recently,
I had occasion to be walking back across the sports field and
gardens from occupational therapy to the ward. I remember looking
at the blades of high grass and then recoiling instantly--I felt
they were censuring me for my miserable condition. I recognised
that they were living organisms, emanating vitality; I was not.
Of course, this all seems absurdly irrational, as I knew that, in
any case, my condition was not of my own making. Yet, nonetheless,
the experience was unavoidable. Guilt is a constant companion,
though; by any criterion, there exist no grounds for guilt.
Even as I write these lines, my mind has become so blank that I
am "coerced" into ceasing forthwith.


I know not when I will write this story, but I know one
thing clearly; that I regard it as my life's work, not only to
recover totally and permanently from this evil illness, but to
portray the depths of human suffering that, if we are to "believe"
the latest medical findings, a deficiency or surplus of the tissue
enzyme, serotonin, can produce. I doubt if any period of confinement
conceived in the long history of man's inhumanity to his
fellow man can surpass, or indeed equal, the naked pain that
exists in the depressed person, when the entire life-instinct has
been erased. There, in that single, short statement of fact, lies
both the miracle and the anguish of Homo-sapiens existence.

At the time of this writing (11:00 A.M.), I am becoming
increasingly concerned about the operation of the treatment.
The improvements which I described above and which, in the

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048403-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My present condition can be reasonably compared to my
general situation during the period January to June, 1972. Therefore,
although not constantly acutely agitated, there is no doubt
that the depression is still functioning vigorously and consequently
preventing me from functioning on par physically or mentally.
The foreign agent at work in my being still has a grip of iron
on my whole organism, though admittedly the more severe
melancholia which attended that grip has been relaxed after
nearly a fortnight on the Priadel/Surmontil/Parstellin combination.


My condition, in short, may be described as <i>extremely</i> weak
generally; short exertion tires me, and I have a fairly continual
desire to lie down. Concentration is still very much impaired;
physical symptoms comprehensively described above continue.
Sleep is very restless and frequently characterized by nightmares
now.


Taking the day as a whole, the condition, at least in its mental
aspects, shows the classical pattern of becoming markedly better
as the day runs its course, reaching a "high" in early evening.
This is characteristic of the depressive syndrome, but it has been
absent for months now, in the sense that my feelings of absolute
despair never showed signs of changing during the day.


Finally, it is impossible to talk of the depression having been
cured until the foreign "body," which is so contrary in its actions
and effects, has been finally and permanently eliminated from
my body.


A reflection on suicide: To die as a consequence of financial
ruin, marital situation, or any such circumstance, is, ipso facto
a denial of life, since, to the persons concerned, the trappings
of wealth, status, marriage--whatever--have assumed an importance
greater then the life they rest upon, like a coat of icing
on a Christmas cake. To commit the act of self-inflicted death, in
circumstances such as these, is to admit that life, contained no

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048403-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For a depressive of the endogenous variety, however, who
loses the very feeling of being alive, of possessing intellect, virility,
everything, who descends from being a member of the living to
the domain of the "half-living", closer to death- than to life-instincts.
To such a person, suicide is justified, since he has
nothing to help him when his existence collapses and he ceases to
function in the normal way.


We are all extremely vulnerable in the face of natural forces;
some of our lives are precarious indeed in the wake of man's
world, man's laws, the unbearable pressures that mass society
imposes on the individual in the twentieth century: a snowstorm
here, a typhoon or earthquake there. For myself, I salute you,
Miss Baker, and many, many thousands who were perhaps, less
overtly naked and exposed. God knows why I wrote the above
tripe. Sociology was never a province I took pleasure ramblin'
in! Give me Transylvania any day, baby.


Why must we be burdened with the millstone of thought?
Edgar Allan Poe, for instance ("The City in the Sea")--somewhere
in that piece were invincible thoughts, feelings that defied
hydrogen and oxygen. They found expression in numerous
fashion. However, like those few clips from Hopkins, like the
feelings of most of us--they are beyond comprehension. WE
DARE NOT SAY WHAT WE FEEL. The words I have in mind
are, no doubt, engraved on the brains of "A"-level "historians"
throughout this land--to be regurgitated here and there on
demand. They were used in a different context then, ingeniously
historical in retrospect. To me, they dig like a hammer into my
soul. Thank you, Mr. Poe, for having such courage:
<blockquote>
<p>
While from a proud tower in the town<br />
Death looks gigantically down
</p>
</blockquote>
Thank you very much indeed, you say something which the
social scientists, with their clinical dialect, cannot satisfactorily
convey.

I remember seeing <i>Vision of William Blake</i> in 1968--I
shudder. I can feel, but can no longer perceive. I continue to
tread through the past with my pathetic candle ... very dark in
the past and fiercely frightening. Primo Levi's <i>If This Is a Man</i>--
poetry incarnate ... oh, if only I could express void with such
unassuming, graceful wit and beauty. Like Mr. Wainwright.


(He survived.). All I have is my love of life, but "love" is
not living: I tremble with the thought that I may have a
devastating sojourn ahead of me, years, perhaps.

Preliminary findings, regarding treatment after a week's
medication: Anxiety and hypertension considerably diminished.
This has therefore removed peripheral aspects of the disease
which were the instruments of added misery to the already
acute feeling.


Subjectively speaking, the main symptoms of the malaise
remain as vehemently entrenched as ever, i.e., absolute lack of
ordinary animation and sexual interest; hair texture, still coiled
vigorously and engulfed with dandruff. The feeling of lack of
physical coordination is the general factor.


Parallel to these physical symptoms is the mental inadequacy
(i.e., the mind is still the victim of a debilitating lethargy), with
consequent atrophy, i.e., concentration coefficient still very low;
memory very dimmed and arbitrary; indecisiveness and lack of
self-confidence still manifest themselves, as they clearly will until
the physical aspects disappear with full remission. Sleep remains
troubled again. Though most of these characteristics have been
present in one way or another since January, 1972, and can,
therefore, be regarded as forming, with the exception of very
brief (single days) "recoveries," an unbroken pattern of fifteen
months' depression. The last six months have been more extreme,
and the symptoms, very acute, producing virtual incapacitation.
(They can be compared to the first attack of four months, in
the summer of 1970; the second, of six months, in '71, and the

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048403-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Nearly all the period at Keele in 1972--indeed the entire
year of 1972--was continually characterised by the above
symptoms, which, taken in aggregate, had a very depressing
effect on me personally--to the extent that thoughts concerning
suicide were almost an everyday phenomenon.


Summing up, the only realistic and meaningful description of
my present condition is, by way of borrowing from the first
page of Kafka's Metamorphosis e.g., "As Speed-Jive (edition
twenty-five) awoke one morning from an evening of unquiet,
troubled sleep, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
gigantic insect."


That description, which, to the outsider, may seem like
melodrama and unnecessary exaggeration, is not so in the least,
to the unfortunate recipient of this cancerous disease. For
medical terms in themselves are wholly inadequate to convey the
full crippling reality of the illness, both physically and mentally
ubiquitous, as the "subject" feels it. It is to have oneself violated
for months on end by a "foreign agent"; something which no
end of mental development and previous experience can hope to
prepare one for.

("Match of the day" as the distance: another
reminder).


Franz Kafka's <i>Metamorphosis:</i> One could weep for ten
billion years, or, alternatively, one could shed a tear for, maybe,
.7-.9 second. (A typical burst of E.C.T.)--whichever form of/)
exorcism one chose, it could never remove the inner disgust one
feels for Homo-sapiens, nor alleviate the tragedy of human beings,
of their pitiful predicament. Those children, universal, with no
contours, who will grow up in the wake of the storm created and
promoted by these self-styled "homo-superiors"--one could cry
indeed. Then, occasionally, oceans of joy pour forth at the

After nine days of this new chemical treatment, I still await
that onrush of life-energy, on awakening, that will be the conclusive
proof and evidence that the formula has successfully
attacked the depression (organic).

<b>Wednesday, April 18</b>

It is an extremely slow and arduous business, awaiting, in
hope, the true effect of the drugs to be realised. I am up and
about now but, paradoxically, this tends to aggravate matters,
since the day, as a consequence, is that much longer and correspondingly
more difficult to fill and, thus, endure. I still look
forward to the day when my being is once again fully animated
and when intuition brings with it the personal feeling of spiritual
freedom. Unless that condition is once more realized and maintained,
my future hopes and ambitions will remain unfulfilled.
Toward that end, I get up at a more reasonable hour in the belief
that the effect of the treatment will thus be hastened.


I have had Mogadon, both in capsule and tablet form, and,
on all three occasions, found that the results, in conjunction with
the evening treatment, provoked sleep that, though not as
restless and interrupted as usual, was characterised by predictably
nightmarish dreams. I therefore feel obliged to discontinue
this practice forthwith.


To "live" for a single day with such a total, all-encompassing
incapacitation would be a considerable achievement; to "survive,"
in the flesh, for almost three years, completely oblivious of time,
people, sensations, and seasons, alike, is a small miracle indeed.
If I die soon, I will at least do so with the knowledge, and the
knowledge of those nearest to me, that I fought harder than a
man is reasonably expected to fight in this life.
