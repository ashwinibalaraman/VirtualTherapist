THE next morning I was awake early, and wondered where
on earth I was. Then I remembered that I had just
achieved the almost impossible transition from being an
inmate in a mental hospital to becoming a Sister in another hospital
of the same kind. Strangely enough I felt no sense of triumph
or of vindication. To me it seemed the most natural thing in the
world to step from one condition to the other. Was it part of my
illness?


You considered the ward as you smoked your first cigarette, the
calm objective thoughts overlaying your queasy doubts, but in
spite of this there was the peculiar binocular effect of one eye
looking and searching inwards, and the other eye observing the
outer world which must be explored. Yes, there were some
changes that needed to be made in the ward, but you would have
to go warily so as not to step on anyone's toes.


Yes, I would begin by laying up some emergency trays, then
the sluices needed tidying, and I would have to get on to the male
staff about shaving their patients every day instead of twice a
week.


You began to feel hungry, thought of the large dining-room,
and your mind gave a switch and a heave, and the calm Sister
departed leaving a slightly demented individual who couldn't
enter such a public place for fear of being spied on and talked
about. Calm, cool, starched and rustling Sister Wallace could not
make the cringing schizo eat in the dining-room, so Sister Wallace
would have to starve, wouldn't she?


There was a Sisters' meeting scheduled for one-thirty. I took

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Matron and one of her assistants opened the meeting with the
usual cliché about the difficulty of getting staff, and this seemed
to be the general cue for the usual grumbling about the students
we had. This led to a discussion of youth today, and what were
we coming to? It all seemed rather puerile and you looked down
at your highly polished shoes and thought about the ward.


The afternoon went well. I was finding my way about and
learning about my staff. I listened to their grumbles and suggestions
and discussed these things with them as a good Sister
should.


You fancy yourself.


Well, I was trying to be a good Sister.


An Irish registrar came to do a round, and ended up by giving
me the diagnoses of all forty-four patients, although I only knew
the names of four or five of them. He made some treatment
changes, arranged for two more day patients to be squeezed in,
then rushed off with his white coat-tails flying.


You were off duty for the next two days and had breakfast
brought to your room by rather a surly maid. No dining-rooms
for you.


And then came the next week when I had to work the morning
shift. The staff had changed around and I was on duty with an
elderly male staff nurse who was soon due for retirement.


You had heard some very uncomplimentary stories about him
from the other staff and you soon found out that they had not
exaggerated.


Mr. Haynes was a hopeless nurse and objected to having to
work under a Sister. He liked to give orders and sit in state in the
office. Although he was old enough to be my father, and I could
understand something of his frustration, I could not excuse the
way he spoke to the patients, and the way he delegated duties
that I had given him.


He was my greatest opponent to the idea of male staff caring
for female patients, and he tried to get the other men to back him
up. It was apparent to me that despite his arguments, he was
merely lazy. Left to himself, he dithered about in the office, and
talked about himself and what he thought of the patients, the
doctors, and the other staff.

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I thought I would give him a lead and asked him to assist me
while I got the female patients washed and dressed. He did so,
with a very bad grace. Next, I sent him to give the senile and
helpless women their breakfast. Five minutes later he was back --
the plates looking peculiarly clean. He could not have fed all of
them in that time.


You let it pass, but you resolved to keep an eye on this Mr.
Haynes.


The mornings were very busy indeed. The phone rang constantly.
There were blood samples to take; countless forms to fill
in; the patients to be changed, washed and fed, and all the beds to
be made.


When the day patients arrived, the overcrowded ward was
jam-packed. Everywhere one went, there were patients wandering
about, asking questions, shouting, talking, and leaving pools
on the floor.


You finished ordering the dispensary, took the blood and went
to help the two orderlies who were fully occupied with your ten
demented patients. You directed Mr. Haynes to do the medicines
as he was doing nothing else. That was at eight o'clock. At eight-thirty
he was still doing them, and then you noticed that one of
the orderlies had disappeared.


I found her tearing round with medicine glasses in her hands.
I went into the office and found my staff nurse leaning against the
wall and staring out of the window.


‘Mr. Haynes. The orderly tells me that you sent her round with
medicines?’


‘That's right,’ he said. ‘I told the girl to run round with 'em.
I've got bad feet, y'know.’


‘Never mind about that for the moment. I asked <i>you</i> to do the
medicines; the orderly has more than enough to do in the ward.’


‘Look here,’ he blustered. ‘I belong to the nurses' union --’


‘I don't care whether you belong to the Mothers' Union,’ I said
coldly. ‘If I think you need assistance with a job, I'll give it to
you.’


I walked out and went back to work.


Dr. Jensen -- the consultant -- began his rounds the next morning.
Afterwards there was so much to do -- treatments or medication
to be changed, intravenous injections to be given by the
registrars, new patients to be examined, and almost no staff to
cope with all this and the phone.

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When two o'clock came, I had a list of extra points to pass on
to the charge nurse. One patient was for X-ray; another was due
at physio; a man had to be prepared for a radioactive iodine
tracer test; Mrs. Collins was to have a blood sugar taken before
she was discharged. Mrs. Dorensen was going out with her relatives
at four. Miss Cracken was to be regarded as a suicidal
risk....


And this was supposed to be a psycho-geriatric ward -- not acute
medical.


The next day you were off duty. The maid brought you breakfast
but it tasted peculiar so you left it. Obviously, they were after
you again. What on earth made you think that they were going to
let you get away with being a busy and efficient Sister? If they
didn't get you one way, they'd get you in another.


I got dressed but worries about the ward flooded over me. The
shortage of staff, the chronic overcrowding, Haynes doing the
medicines with a cigarette stuck in his mouth and dropping ash
down his white coat and probably in the medicines. Haynes lolling
in the office while the rest of us were working against the clock....
The scene that had ensued when I had asked him to help in the
ward.... Connolly shoving the patients around as though they
were sacks of coal.... And the score of patients whose names I
didn't even know, who just sat about because there was no one to
give them any more than the barest essentials.


It isn't good enough. What kind of nurse -- or so-called Sister
are you? They're your responsibility. It isn't right to let them
sit there dementing. Did you make out the transport forms for
Collins? Did you order another stock of Largactil? Did you put
down that Smith is for E.C.T. in the morning? Did Haynes get
Mr. Croyde dressed? Is Maxton eating enough? Did you make
out the blood forms correctly? Mrs. Talbot has started hallucinating
again. She would need more E.C.T. but perhaps they could
increase her phenothiazines? Maynard's relatives were inquiring
about his black socks. Where were they? He had come in with
them....


The pressure was building up.


You caught a train into the town to do some shopping. As you
were walking down the high street, you noticed a soldier going in
the opposite direction. You turned into Woolworth's and he was
there again.

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I dodged into Lyons for a cup of tea and there he was again,
seated at the next table, his brass buttons gleaming.


Oh God! They weren't going to start having you followed
again, were they? But what about that woman over by the cash
desk? Surely she was looking at me in a strange way?


You left your tea and hurried to the station. What about the
breakfast that the maid had brought you? It had tasted odd,
hadn't it? They were trying to poison you. And take a look at
that woman across the street. She's following you.


No she's not. She's just an ordinary pedestrian.


Is she? Is she?


I locked myself in my room and tried to read, but it was no use.
Thoughts tumbled about in my mind. Poisoning, tailing -- what
kind of punishment was this?


Thursday came. Get into your uniform. Forget about the
Stelazine -- a fat lot of use they are to you. Now over to the ward.
Turn on a smile. Must keep up appearances.


‘Good morning, Miss Cochrane. How are you?’


‘Terrible, Sister. It's these voices in my head. They keep saying
four-letter words -- never in my life heard such language.’


‘The E.C.T. will help get rid of them.’


‘I'm afraid.’


‘I know, but it's the answer.’


‘I'll do anything, Sister. I just hope and pray that nothing like
this ever happens to you. It's terrible... all the time.’


‘I know, Miss Cochrane. If you will just sign here, doctor will
give you a treatment tomorrow.’


‘All right, Sister. I'm putting my trust in you.’


Bright, shiny brass buttons.... The woman by the cash
desk.... The peculiar-tasting breakfast....


‘Good morning, Mrs. Higgs. Good morning, Joe. What's
going to win the two-thirty?’


‘Well, I've got me eye on something today. Going to 'ave two
bob on it are you?’


‘I might.’


‘'Morning, Mr. Bracebridge. Do you know the date today?’


‘Hullo, darling. It's about eighteen hundred.’


‘How old are you?’


‘A hundred and ten.’


‘Your shirt's undone.’


‘What does it matter?’

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Still hypomanic. Not eating much. He could do with a shave.
Must remember to wash out his tie.


‘Sister. Nurse Connolly can't come in today -- her baby's sick.’


Hell. One short. That just leaves Haynes, one orderly, and
you.


The soldier... that woman in the train. The food.... When
did I eat last? Must have been five days ago.... Now into the
office. The dispensary to order; the diet sheets; hardware today.
Two admissions due and the patients not discharged from the beds
yet. Out into the female dormitory. Sleeves up. Can't run a
ward from the office, and smile, damn you.


Empty the commodes, dress those four. Wash them. Comb
their hair. Help to lift these two into chairs. Make up the beds
for the new patients. Go past the linen bins -- full of stinking
sheets. Must ask the maid to scrub out the sluice. Breakfast-time
and we're late. Ask Haynes to do the feeding in the female dorm.


Now into the lounge-cum-dining-room. Put out the bread and
butter. Damn that phone. Where's Mr. Bracebridge? Wandered
out into the garden. Bring him back. Serve him breakfast.


Haynes back already with the porridge plates. Bet he threw it
down the sluice. Scramble some eggs for the dements and feed
them yourself -- be sure they've had something.


Direct Haynes to do the medicines. He finished a cup of tea
slowly and sauntered into the office. Great temptation to put a
stick of dynamite under him.


Here come the day patients to add to the confusion. No room.
No room to breathe.


‘Sister, I've got a pain in my leg, and I never slept all night.
Give me a tablet.’


Miss Catner. Hysteric. That's how I might get.


‘Sister, I can't stay here another minute. I feel all worked up
and my memory is getting terrible.’


Mrs. Marney. Depression. Probably had enough E.C.T.


Two doctors arrive. Give them the medicine cards to write up.
Show one the diabetic chart. Give that E.C.G. record to the
other. Another doctor comes in.


‘Good morning, Sister. Can I see Mrs. Dell?’


Go to find the patient. Put her in a side room after I've wheeled
Mona back into the dormitory. Show the doctor the room. Get
back to the office. Haynes still doing the medicines. The doctors
have left the cards strewn all over the desk. Phone ringing.

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘Will you send Mrs. Briggs to X-ray at eleven o'clock?’


‘Yes, thank you.’


‘We'll do a round, Sister.’


Shining buttons.... Uniform.... Always about. Has he
followed me here, or have they sent someone else?


Pick up a memo pad and follow the doctors into the lounge.
Patients milling about everywhere. The noise is deafening. ‘Why
don't you give those bloody dements six grains of Amytal? That
would shut them up. No more noise.’


Now what's going on?


‘I'd like to examine Miss Brady.’


Find Miss Brady. Get her undressed, and put her into the spare
side-room. Perhaps the orderly could chaperone? Where is the
orderly?


‘Sister. I haven't much time. Where is Miss Brady?’


‘Sister. I want Mr. Bracebridge to have Largactil. And I'll
just give him some I.V. Parentrovite.’


A tray to be laid. Where's Haynes?


‘Sister. The two admissions have arrived. Where are they to
go? And the relatives want to see you.’


The surgeon tapping his foot in the corridor. Hurry into Miss
Brady.


‘I'd like her to have two enemas straight away. Phone the
result to me, and I might just look at her X-rays....’


‘Sister. I want to examine the two new patients.’


They're not even in bed yet.


‘Sister. Have you got that I.V. tray ready?’


‘Sister. I'd like to talk to you about Mrs. Seaton's property...’
(the social worker now). ‘She had a nice green cardigan when she
came in and she hasn't got it now.’


‘Sister. Have you got those X-rays?’


‘Sister. Are my patients ready for examination?’


‘Sister. I've got a nasty twitch in my eye...’


‘Sister. Can you give me Mr. Jones's notes?’


The occupational therapists arrive.


‘Sister. I'd like to have some country dancing this morning. I
know how the old people like it. Can you send someone to help
clear a space in here?’


A space. Dear God. In here.


‘Sister. The X-rays!’


‘Sister. The I.V. tray!’

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘Sister. The two new patients!’


Sister! Sister! Sister!


You trailed off duty an hour late. The ward was sheer chaos. It
was no use kidding yourself any more. You were no good as a
Sister. You were finished.


That man standing by Out-patients... that black car parked
outside the home... that breakfast tray.... It all added up. But
what was I going to do?


I waited until evening and phoned Kay. I was surprised to find
myself sobbing. The pips sounded and I put some more money
in the box.


‘What shall I do, Kay?’


‘You've got to give yourself a chance, Clare. You've only been
there a little while. Tell me about this soldier.’


You told her about him, and about all the other things too.


‘There isn't much time to talk,’ Kay said. ‘It sounds like one of
two things. Either it's the newness and will clear up, or you're
having another acute episode -- in which case I should get the hell
out of there.’


‘How can I do that? I don't know...’


‘There's only one thing to do. Go to the consultant and tell
him everything.’


‘He'll be furious.’


‘You will just have to put up with that. Take it easy. It's your
decision. There are the pips. Good-bye.’


The next morning you were off duty, and you went to see the
consultant. He listened quietly while you condensed an endless
story into five minutes. He asked a few questions and then jingled
a key ring in his pocket.


‘Well, Sister. If you feel like that I'll help you to leave on
medical grounds. But I would say that I've found nothing wrong
with your work. I suggest that you phone Dr. Cross and get his
opinion. He knows you.’


‘He isn't in today, but I could phone him tomorrow.’


‘You're on duty then, aren't you?’


I was.


‘Can you cope?’


‘I think so.’


‘Right. Well, you let me know what he says....’

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went on duty the next day in a dream. This wasn't really
happening. It couldn't be true and real....


At ten o'clock you put through a call to Dr. Cross. He sighed
slightly when he heard your story. ‘- The decision is really yours,
Clare. You know my views. I think you need eighteen months in
hospital for rehabilitation -- and, of course, give up nursing.’


When Dr. Jensen came in at twelve, I told him what Dr. Cross
had said.


‘And what is your decision, Sister?’


All those weeks of private nursing to save for this job....
Charlie.... John.... Mary.... Ann -- ‘But I had to say
that you weren't ready for a Sister's post -- I'm sorry....’ Eighteen
months in hospital... ‘Get the hell out of there...’ Room
twelve. Sister C. M. Wallace.


‘I think I'll leave, sir. As soon as possible. I'm very sorry. If I
could have foreseen... I would never have applied for this post.’


No, you wouldn't.


Later, I went to my room and automatically turned on my transistor
radio. Roy Orbison was singing <i>It's Over</i>. The song
echoed in my mind.


‘-- All the rainbows in the sky... You won't be seeing rainbows
any more. It's over...’


I carefully parcelled my uniform and repacked my cases.


‘It's over, it's over, it's over... IT'S OVER.’
