<font size="4"><b>Chapter 16: Disorders of Volition</b></font>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>


Previous chapters have been concerned with disorders
of emotion, perception, and thought--that is, with
emotional and cognitive disabilities. Obviously, no part
of this material dealt solely with either emotion or
cognition, since the emotional and cognitive elements
of experience are closely interrelated and in addition,
knit with the conative (striving) aspects of experience.
Reports that have emphasized volitional disabilities
may next be considered.


In Chapter 2 I demonstrated repeatedly that
many psychiatric patients first became aware of their
mental disturbance and acknowledged the fact when
they realized that they could no longer exert voluntary
<i>control</i> of their thoughts and behavior. I have also
cited many excerpts made by individuals who might
admit that their perceptual and intellectual functioning
was faulty and confused, and yet continued to
insist that they were in control of their mental faculties
and that they were in no sense insane. Similarly, other
patients have related how they became overwhelmed
by senseless fear or anger but still continued to insist

[p. <i>334</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00350&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Every person believes that he can, by using his own will power,
control and direct his thoughts and behavior. Furthermore, he is confident
that he, and only he, is responsible for his inner life and external behavior.
If unreasonable and pervasive thoughts or feelings intrude into
his mind, or if he finds himself behaving in some peculiar way, he
rationalizes both the event and the surrounding circumstances; that is,
he quickly supplies an explanation (which may or may not be true)
that satisfies him (or others) and that fits the event into the more usual
and acceptable categories of experience. The major function of this
rationalization process is that of adjusting successive phases of inner
experience into the reasonable, self-consistent stream which is part of
the broad stream of the person's mental life. But when the patient finds
that his own thoughts and behavior proceed in an uncontrollable fashion
for which he can no longer find a "reasonable" basis, he becomes convinced
that his mind has come under some external or supernatural
control, more powerful than any strength of will or volitional process he
may possess. For example, visual hallucinations, persistence of hallucinatory
voices, compulsions, and unnatural feeling-states will compel the
person to realize that mysterious outside governing forces are more
powerful than any self-generated, internal control. At this point he will
usually retreat, saying that he is no longer responsible for his mental
life and social behavior. Such an admission generally makes "sense,"
both to the afflicted person and to everyone else, since a mental illness
is popularly regarded as a disruption of psychological processes that
results in a loss of control.


But what is will power? How can I, or anyone else, recognize the
qualitative or quantitative aspects of the experience of will? Volitional
experiences do not bear self-scrutiny or prolonged introspection. The
experience is tenuous, fleeting, and fluid. It affords little or no basis for
rational or objective verification. This tenuous quality is so generally
recognized that further analysis or explanation is rarely requested. There
are many varieties of mental experience, such as fragments of remembrances,
memory traces of decisions, fleeting feelings, patterns of
preconceptions, and other tricks of mind, that are ordinarily neither
scrutinized nor scrutinizable. We can only accept such experiential
material as part of the qualitative stuff that complicates and "flavors"
conscious awareness. Everyone recognizes the elusive nature of such
fragments of conscious experience; if these experiences do not continue
for too long and are not too intrusive or demanding, they are usually
ignored. The volitional capacity (whether for simple movements or
complex deeds) must neither be absent nor grossly interfere with the
general mental processes. If the volitional quality is persistently absent

Disorders of volition have received various designations, depending
on the circumstances of their occurrence and the effect on the person
having the experience. Among the terms used in this connection are fixed
ideas, obsessions, compulsions, irresistible ideas, imperative commands,
and abulia.


<i>Fixed Ideas</i>


In order to gain some understanding of the nature of these types of
volitional disabilities--minor obsessions--examples were collected by
Berry from a group of normal college students. Berry requested the
students to provide him with answers to two questions: first, "Do you
have or have you had any fixed ideas?" and second, "Do you have any
ideas which involuntarily come to you when you are fatigued?" The
following are a few of the answers he received to these questions.


I used to have a fixed idea of a monstrous stone so high that I couldn't
see its top, and the stone would begin to roll toward me menacingly. I haven't
had it, however, since I was a little youngster. So now it is very vague. Only
the fearful sensation remains.


I have ... a fixed idea ... I don't remember ever being seriously
injured with a knife ... I can't imagine where I ever developed such a feeling
of perfect terror for that object. The thought of it comes at most inopportune
times when there is no occasion at all for is appearance. I can be talking on an
apparently interesting topic of conversation when all at once without any
warning, whatever, I shudder as I feel the blade of a knife hurting me. I know
it is ridiculous to imagine that I am being cut, but I cannot help being
frightened.... Sometimes I can feel the sharp blade in my mouth and I am
perfectly certain that in real life it never was there. I haven't told anyone of
the queer sensation for I do not wish to be considered abnormal....


When I was about eight years of age I had a fixed idea. I thought I was
going to cut my throat from ear to ear with a certain large butcher-knife in my
grandmother's kitchen. I couldn't throw off the idea. I was afraid to go near
the knife. This persisted for about two weeks, then gradually wore off. When
fatigued certain combinations of words or letters recur again and again. Often
I am wholly unaware of their origin. For instance the words "sy," "cip" have
come to me over and over the last few days, and I am absolutely ignorant of
where or when I heard or saw them....


I am not sure the following would be designated as a fixed idea, but
I have never been able to discover any reason for the occurrence. My home
for several years was on a farm. I never went into the large barn alone that I

[p. <i>336</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00352&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I do have fixed ideas ... When I am at a railway station watching a
train come in I have a desire to jump in front of it and I never have been able
to get rid of this feeling. The same thing happened when I saw Niagara Falls
this summer. I felt as though something were urging me to jump into them.
(Berry, 1916, pp. 19-22)


Fixed ideas similar to those described by Berry's subjects are not
uncommon in the everyday life of the normal individual. The experience
is often reported to be mildly unpleasant, intrusive, and of unknown
origin. Although fixed ideas are largely conative in nature they cannot
be started, modified, or stopped voluntarily. During an individual's life
span, experiences begin, run their course, and slowly lose their emotional
impact over a period of time. Fixed ideas of this degree of intensity
cannot be considered as pathological per se. They seem to differ from
true pathological experience largely in terms of intensity or of the extent
to which they complicate the general mental functioning of the individual.


<i>Obsessions</i>


When a fixed idea or feeling continues to intrude into a person's
thinking, often it may lead to behavior which that person comes to
regard as unreasonable and annoying. This continuous condition is
termed an obsession. We may illustrate this concept from the account of
a general surgeon who, after entering the British Army during World
War II, found himself overtaken by feelings of anxiety and by obsessive
ideas. He found that these ideas forced him to attempt to restrain his
thoughts and behavior during his professional work. Finally these ideas
compelled him to seek psychiatric assistance. He later described his
experiences in this way.


Acute visual obsessions were terrifying, both because of their apparent
meaninglessness, and because of their independent existence. I often had the
most acute image, for instance, of a hammer and screwdriver working away
at my skull, or of my skull being forced open and spat into, perhaps at a
moment when an observer would only have noted me as a surgeon doing
some operation or talking to my commanding officer. I would be opening an
abdomen, for instance, and would have the most vivid hallucinosis of eyes
looking at me from within the cavity. At night I was driven to distraction by
thoughts of self-destruction--not by the wish to do so but an accurate representation
of suicide in various unpleasant ways--and I took elaborate precautions

[p. <i>337</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00353&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This surgeon became convinced that he was losing his mind, and
that he was beyond ordinary medical help. His surgical work continued
to be satisfactory but his loss of self-control became so unbearable that
he had to be invalided from active military service in order to seek
intensive psychotherapy.


Another description was written by a patient who, having overworked
for many years, finally consulted a physician because of stomach
pains. During the medical treatment Dr. Baillarger found that the patient
had many hypochondriacal complaints and obsessions and had written a
manuscript detailing both his physical and mental symptoms. Portions of
this manuscript were published by Dr. Baillarger, from which the following
is a relevant excerpt.


If I decided to go horse-back riding I would see myself falling on my
head and breaking it on the rocks; the ideas of a boat excursion brought without
fail the idea of being ship-wrecked. In the country, it was the fear of
snakes that would pursue me; it seemed to me that there were some even in
my bed. Whatever security my room offered me I could not go to bed without
first making a thorough search and it is with difficulty that I would fall asleep.
This fear of snakes would follow me even to the city. Sometimes I would
imagine that somebody was hidden under my bed in order to stab me; the
slightest noise would keep me awake and provoke in me fears, and I would
never consent to sleep alone in a house. I always bear in mind objects, people
and even the places I am being told about and if I am told about a scene I
immediately see all the characters appear. If I am told, for example, of the
death of some woman, I see that person immediately, she is being placed in
a coffin, I assist at her burial, she is lowered into the grave and <i>all this is in
my mind</i>. Often I have seen myself dead and assisted in advance at my own
funeral procession. (Baillarger, 1856, p. 56)


Dr. Baillarger considered that this patient's complaints were a form
of monomania and wrote at some length concerning the automatisms
involved. It is obvious that the patient was overwhelmed by obsessive
fears--particularly fear of death--and that he had no voluntary control
over his intrusive and obsessive thoughts. At the time this report was
published (1856) the patient was certainly disturbed and handicapped
in his everyday activities, but he was not considered to be candidate
for admission to an asylum.


However, there have been instances in which obsessions may, if
sufficiently acute, lead the individual to believe that his mind has gone
astray and that he should be hospitalized as one who is mentally incompetent.
A patient who had been committed to a mental hospital
because of obsessive ideas and compulsive behavior, which led to general

[p. <i>338</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00354&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm constantly afraid I'm going out of my head.... Anything that comes
up in my head I try to remember. If I walk the street I try to remember
everything I see. There is no reason for my doing it except that I must remember
it.... Since I have been in the hospital I have had all sorts of compulsions....
The worst of it all is, Doctor, that I feel I have to remember. I'll be
unhappy all day now because I'll try to remember everything I said to you
and everything you said to me....


I am forced to remember everything; I hear something on the radio and
then I have to know all about the words of that song; when I look at the
window I have to keep counting all the windows and try to remember them;
when I go to bed at night I have to keep repeating the names of the patient
on my left and the one on my right for fear I won't remember them in the
morning and this keeps me from sleeping; I know I am incurable; this
drives me mad. (Zeifert, 1940, p. 295)


As far as one can judge from this patient's account, his depression
and anxieties were thought by him to be secondary to the driving force
of his obsessions and his inability to exercise any control over them. It
was as if compulsive questions and doubts had overwhelmed him in
most of his activities, both physical and mental. Although he realized
the absurdity of his obsessional ideas, he could not by his own will
control or change them. Generally speaking, obsessions are intrusive,
irrational, and uncontrollable mental states. Even if a patient does recognize
some of the aspects of the origin of his trouble, he remains unable
to control the persistent ideas or emotions and cannot resist actions that
grow out of the obsessions.


<i>Compulsions</i>


The terms <i>obsession</i> and <i>compulsion</i> are used somewhat interchangeably.
<i>Obsession</i> implies a persistent, unavoidable, haunting idea,
usually motivated by fear, while <i>compulsion</i> implies a more definite
force that acts against the will and, in turn, leads to overt action. Since
both terms are used in trying to describe persistent and unwelcome
feelings that tend to lead to action, neither term can be expected to
convey much descriptive precision or clear understanding.


A forty-year-old patient wrote Dr. E. Straus a description of the
development of a compulsive system of ideas and behavior that had
overwhelmed her. While ill in a hospital some fifteen or twenty years
earlier, a visitor had placed a bouquet of flowers on her bed. Her cousin
had removed the bouquet saying that flowers should not be placed on an
invalid's bed. This cousin had a three-year-old son who died several
weeks after this incident. The patient then became obsessed by the idea

[p. <i>339</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00355&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If one of these [neighborhood] people touched me, I would have to
wash the affected garment with soap flakes or benzine. Or someone who had
been there [the cemetery] would come to our house, and then I cannot move
around properly. I have the feeling as if the rooms were becoming too narrow
and I were hitting everything with my dress. I have to go through the
door sideways. In order to find peace, I wash everything in soapy water and,
depending on the circumstances, I also have to wash the dress which I wore
at the time. Then everything becomes large and wide again and I have room.
If I go shopping and someone is in the store, I cannot go in, because I might
either be pushed by the people there, or receive the money that had belonged
to them. Thus, I am anxious the whole day long and this anxiety drives me
hither and yon. Now I have to wipe away or wash something here, then over
there.... I do not find peace anywhere.... I am also disturbed by pictures
in newspapers and magazines where such things are portrayed. If I happen to
lay my hand on them I again wash it with soap.... Inwardly I am constantly
agitated and the beautiful saying suits me well: "Where thou art not,
there dwells peace!" (Straus, 1938, p. 64)


According to Straus, this woman's basic obsession consisted of a
senseless but pervasive fear of death. This fear spread to germs and
contamination and then generalized to a fear of contamination of any
sort. Although she realized intellectually that her fears and compulsive
rituals were nonsensical, she was not able to exercise sufficient selfcontrol
to maintain her peace of mind.


When obsessions and compulsions characterize the individual's
reaction to internal conflict and anxiety, as in Straus' patient, the condition
is generally referred to as obsessive-compulsive neurosis. The actual
symptoms, however, are not restricted to this diagnostic category. Some
psychotic patients, particularly schizophrenics, live through periods of
incessant, obsessive mental activity. Schreber, for example, complained
bitterly of his mental disturbances that were created by such compulsive
behavior.


This [divine] influence showed itself relatively early in the form of <i>compulsive
thinking</i>--an expression which I received from the inner voices themselves
and which will hardly be known to other human beings, because the
whole phenomenon lies outside all human experience. The nature of compulsive
thinking lies in a human being having to think incessantly; in other
words, man's natural right to give the nerves of his mind their necessary rest
from time to time by thinking nothing (as occurs most markedly during

[p. <i>340</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00356&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Compulsive thinking ... contravenes man's natural right of mental relaxation ...
it disturbs the "basis" of a human being. My nerves are influenced by
the rays to vibrate corresponding to certain human words; their choice therefore
is not subject to my own will, but is due to an influence exerted on me
from without. From the beginning the <i>system of not-flnishing-a-sentence</i> prevailed ...
the words so produced contain not mainly finished thoughts, but
unfinished ideas ... It is in the nature of nerves that if unconnected words or
started phrases are thrown into them, they automatically attempt to complete
them to finished thoughts satisfactory to the human mind. (Schreber, 1955, pp.
70; 171)


The experience Schreber said would "hardly be known to other
human beings" has actually been recounted by many other persons, both
normal and deranged. Psychotic compulsions differ from the typical
neurotic's compulsions in that the former usually attributes the irresistible
demands and orders to an external force. Also, in obsessive-compulsive
neuroses there is a continuum between the persistent thought and the act
-- both seem to originate from one single dynamic cause, as seemed to be
true for Straus' patient. In contrast, Schreber's compulsion seemed to be
related to his over-all psychotic disturbance rather than to some specific
fear. When one recalls that Schreber had been the Presiding Judge of a
high court, his lack of volitional and intellectual control becomes yet
more impressive as a form of disturbance.


Obsessive ideas do in some cases become so intense that the person
fears his own impulses, which may become homicidal. In 1882, a physician
who had testified in the trial of a man accused of attempting to take
the life of the Queen of England, received a lengthy letter signed
"Sufferer," which he submitted for publication. The letter was concerned
with a strong compulsion to commit murder that the writer said he had
experienced for many years. Some passages are of unusual interest.


Now, sir, <i>I am a Homicidal</i> (and sometimes Suicidal) <i>Maniac</i>. Up to the
present time I have only <i>thought</i> these awful thoughts, I have never put them
in <i>action</i>, but at the same time it is quite true that I cannot control them (the
thoughts). But for God's help (in answer to agonizing prayer) I know not
where I might ere now have been. It is awful to contemplate.


To go back. It is now 17 years since I had an attack of nervous debility,
brought on by working overtime to help my dear old parents (curse overtime).
One night my mother was away from home, and I slept with my
father. There was an old Dagger in a cupboard in the Room, and my thoughts

[p. <i>341</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00357&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Go where I will, be where I may, in Church, Chapel, Street, House, or
public Meeting of any sort, the same ideas pursue me. <i>I hear</i> NO <i>voices</i>. It
seems an IMPULSE, as in other people there is an impulse to go whoring, &amp;c.;,
when no object is present to give rise to the thought. But I argue this way.
Sins of the flesh, avarice, ambition, &amp;c.;, are <i>natural</i>, my mania is <i>unnatural;</i>
and whatever is unnatural must be wrong. Still it is all of no use. However I
will hope, strive, pray, and endeavour by God's help not to fall. I am certainly
in Hell. Such thoughts form a Hell to anyone who has just sense enough
to know they are wrong. (Manning, 1882, pp. 370-371)


This letter leaves no doubt about the compulsive tendencies which
the writer had up to that time successfully resisted. The writer was certain
that his impulses were evil and unnatural, but was skeptical of being able
to keep up his resistance.


We may mention another oft-cited example of homicidal mania, the
case of a Frenchman named Glenadel. He had always been very devoted
to his mother, but at the age of sixteen he became obsessed with the
idea that he might "accidentally" kill her. This obsession was most
repugnant to him, and to relieve his guilt he somehow shifted its object,
so that the compulsion was directed toward his sister-in-law. In order
to avoid committing an actual murder, he enlisted as a soldier; while in
the Army, however, he found himself continually obsessed with the idea
that he might desert in order to return home and carry out his tormenting
impulse. After several years word reached him that his sister-in-law had
died, upon which he accepted a furlough and returned home. To his
horror, he found his sister-in-law and mother both alive and well. In an
attempt at self-protection, Glenadel had himself roped in bed and then
requested that he be committed to a mental hospital. When the examining
health officer asked him, among other things, whether he had any
complaints against his mother, he replied as follows.


No, monsieur, I loved her very much; thus, before starting, I said to
myself [in 1812], "Shall I kill that mother who has exercised so much care
over me during my infancy, and who has loved me so well, although I have
entertained this fatal thought against her? I will not do it, but I must kill
some one." It was then that the thought of killing my sister-in-law first occurred
to me; I have a distinct recollection of this, I being at that time in
Dax, and it was in the year 1832. It was then [1837] announced to me that
my sister-in-law was dead, which was a mistake, it being another relative who
had died. I then accepted the furlough they had offered me, which I should
by no means have done, had I known that my sister-in-law was still living.
When I reached my home, and was informed that she was not dead, I experienced

[p. <i>342</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00358&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the time of this examination, 1839, Glenadel had been suffering
from the same compulsive homicidal urge for 26 years. During all these
years he was able to resist the idea and conduct himself rationally. On
the evening of his admission to the asylum he wrote to the physician-in-charge
saying that he would behave himself at all times, and continuing,
"You will think me cured. At moments perhaps I shall pretend to be so.
Never believe me. Never let me out on any pretext: The only use I shall
make of my liberty will be to commit a crime which I abhor."


That such compulsive ideas may actually break through all barriers
of inhibition and self-restraint is illustrated by the case of a patient who
shot and killed a surgeon who had previously treated her. When asked
why she killed him, she replied as follows.


Because I couldn't get him out of mind: and this from the time I left
the hospital; that made him a victim too. I couldn't understand why I was so
attracted to him. I could control myself before that; what I mean, I couldn't
stay away from him. That person was always in my mind! Before the
operation I could have kept from thinking about him, but afterward I never
could. And I couldn't stay away from his office. I knew that as long as I was
in the city that I'd always think of him. I thought that was the only way to get
him out of my thoughts.... I'd give anything I could ever have to be what I
was before the operation. That is, able to work, able to control myself, rid
of the numbness and cramps in my arms and legs, and the ideas, too.... The
feeling like wanting the Doctor, and wanting to be near him and all that, these
caused me the most trouble. I thought that was the only way to get him out
of my thoughts. That was the biggest reason--to get him out of my mind. My
mind since, is relieved. I don't think about him as much as I did before.
(Rathmell and Corrin, 1940, pp. 318-319)


This woman was said by the police to be partially deranged after
the murder. She had yielded to her obsession, believing that overt action
would drive the idea of the doctor out of her mind. Although she said
in this interview that her mind was relieved after the murder, her subsequent
behavior gave evidence of the persistence of further compulsions
and destructive tendencies. The psychiatric report of her case brought
out the evidence that from childhood the patient had been a lonely, unloved
person. Her development, physical and psychological, was considered
to be abnormal. With respect to the murder, the court psychiatrist
concluded that during her period of aftercare from surgery, when she
had received understanding and sympathetic treatment, she had fixated
her need for affection on the surgeon, and, the need remaining unfulfilled,
her emotional cravings and morbid ideas had led her to commit murder.


Obsessive ideas and compulsions may lead to criminal acts other

I was out one day a little further from home than usual and resting
against a railing, when opposite me at a groundfloor window I saw a young
woman. She was standing just between two lace curtains and looking at me.
Suddenly the thought flashed into my mind: "What if that girl should see
me naked?" The idea was ridiculous, I knew, but my limbs began to tremble,
and a cold sweat broke out over me. "What if I could not control myself, and
I were to unfasten my clothes before her," was the next thought. I became torn
with a panic of fear.... From that day this new dread was added to the
others. For about a year I never went out of doors without the fear that I might
expose myself. The acuteness of the agony that this cost me was probably
greater than any of my other dreads.... Sometimes when very bad I would
make a pretence of going down the stairs of an entry to the basement where
the cellars were. I had often done this to get away to absolute quietness. Now
in my extremity, I resorted to this means of escape and while there my
strength failed me. I did that which I had feared [exposed himself], for
facing me at the other side of the garden upon which the basement opened
were a number of houses, their windows looking towards where I stood.
(Raymond, 1946, p. 59)


When the spasm was over, David found himself lying on a rubbish
heap, dazed and exhausted. To save the scandal of open court proceedings,
he was certified as mentally irresponsible and committed to a mental
hospital. The court and physicians held that his was a case where the
temporary inhibition of will power resulted from "acute nervousness."
The disability caused by the fear of open places had somewhat subsided
before the act of indecent exposure, but during and after hospitalization
all his phobias returned in full force.


It is apparent that there is little essential difference between a
fixed or perseverative idea and an obsession or compulsion, except that
obsessions and compulsions are usually much more socially harmful and
disturbing. These disorders of volition usually involve great anxiety and
fear, but the anxiety and fear are not of themselves reported by the
sufferer as being the primary motivating force of the disturbance. The
onset and course of disorders of volition may be experienced and
described somewhat as follows: "For reasons I do not know, I found
myself possessed by a feeling of being compelled to think about some
specific idea and then to act upon the idea. I could not and cannot control
this compulsion; rather, it controls me. I usually realize that the compulsion
has no logical or rational basis, but it forces me to think and
behave unreasonably. Usually I am aware that no positive gain will result

<i>Irresistible Impulses</i>


The experience of quite suddenly feeling compelled to perform some
involuntary action--against one's better judgment--is termed an irresistible
impulse. The impulse--for example, an unreasonable fit of anger--is
usually described as coming into the mind abruptly and overriding all
other thoughts. The concept of irresistible impulse has some status in
courts of law, which implies that it has happened frequently among the
general population as well as among deranged persons. The following
account recorded by an anonymous writer is typical.


One night, after a number of weeks of fearful suffering, as I was lying
in bed tossing, sleepless and despairing, a most horrible impulse seized me,
an impulse impelling me to destroy one who of all living beings, most deserved
my love. I buried myself under the bedcloths and struggled with the hellish
impulse till the bed shook. It still gained strength. I sprang up, clung to the
bedpost and sunk my teeth, in the agony of despair, into the hard wood.
It was uncontrollable. I shut my eyes, bowed down my head for fear that I
should see her, and rushed out of the house. Bare-footed, with no covering save
a nightshirt, I ran through the streets to the Police Office and implored them to
lock me up. Fortunately the officer on duty was a humane and sensible man.
He gave me a watch-coat to wrap around me, kept me under his own eye,
and, I suppose, sent notice to my friends, for my wife and sister came with
clothing. The paroxysm had passed, and gasping, panting for death in any
form, I accompanied them home, steeped to the lips in despair. (Anon., 1947,
pp. 17-18)


The major difference between an experience such as this and an
obsessive-compulsive tendency is the <i>rapidity</i> with which the former
seizes the individual and his almost complete inability to exercise selfcontrol.
In this case the destructive urge formed part of the onset of a
total breakdown; in spite of the kindly action of the police, the patient's
continued agitation led to his early removal to an asylum. In such a
situation the word <i>asylum</i> is actually more appropriate than the word
<i>hospital</i>.

<i>Inner Commands</i>


For the most part, the involuntary actions and disrupting conative
experiences we have considered, thus far, have been instances where the
underlying motivation seemed to the sufferer to be nonspecific. Another
variety of such disorders describes feelings that are related to an inner
compulsion, an <i>inner</i> force or urge, an inner feeling of "<i>I must</i>." Some
patients, particularly those suffering from auditory hallucinations, attribute
the impulses to certain statements or commands given by these
voices. The commands lead to thoughts and behavior which may be much
the same as those related to nonspecific feelings; but, in this case, the
patient feels that there exists a real basis (or what seems to him to be a
rational basis) for his essentially involuntary thoughts and actions.


Perceval recounted the extent to which his behavior during his
mental derangement resulted from commands issued by the voices. He
rejected or tried to reject many of them, particularly since at the beginning
of the episodes the voices often seemed to provide irrational commands.
Several incidents may be cited to illustrate the interaction between
the hallucinatory commands and Perceval's bizarre behavior.


A spirit came upon me and prepared to guide me in my actions.... I
heard voices without and within me ... I understood that I was only saved
by the mercy of Jesus ... Actuated by the same spirit, I took a like position
on the floor, where I remained, until I understood that the work of the Lord
was perfected.... The guidance of the spirit left me, and I became in doubt
what next I was to do.... After some hesitation, I heard the command, to
"<i>take your position on the floor again</i>."...


Returning to the common room [after meals], I always attempted to
wrestle with, or asked one of the patients to wrestle with me, I was then locked
into my seat. If my arms were at liberty, I would occasionally seize one or
two of the patients to wrestle with me as they passed by me. I had no malicious
motive; I did it in obedience to inspiration, and imagined they were inspired
to know what I was commanded, how I obeyed, and how to act in
consequence. My attempts at wrestling were however inculcated by the spirits
on more practical grounds than ordinary. They told me that it was necessary
"for the <i>keeping me in a right state of mind</i>," in other words, "to keep my
head to my heart, and my heart to my head"; that I should be suffocated, or
strangled, or violently exercised, or at least perform one act of obedience to
the Lord Jehovah supremely Omnipotent, in a certain rhyme or measure once
or twice through the day ...


Another delusion I laboured under was, that I should keep my head
and heart together, and so serve the Lord, by throwing myself head over heels
over every stile or gate I came to; the condition here was as before, on its
being done <i>in precision and decision</i>. I often attempted and failed, getting
smart strokes from the cane of Herminet Herbert [his attendant]. I knew it was
dangerous, but I expected to be miraculously preserved if I did it aright. At
last I did it outright, and my head struck upon a stone, on the other side.

[p. <i>346</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00362&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Explanations such as these given by Perceval for his behavior are
illustrative of the inner conative struggles of many psychotic patients.
The voices, stating that they are of divine origin, give orders which may
seem somewhat foolish to the patient, but an order from God is a
command which constitutes both an inspiration and a threat. If the
patient does not comply at once and wholeheartedly, the voices then tell
him that he will be punished. Not only will he himself suffer, but because
of his doubts or lack of conviction, other people will also suffer and die.
The patient's dilemma is further complicated by the fact that the commands
are often ambiguous and unclear; suggestions are given and
rewards promised, but once the command is followed through, involving
personal danger and humiliation, the patient finds that nothing has
changed. Hence, having obeyed the orders he attributed to supernatural
control, the patient is at a loss, for he is informed by the voices that he
misunderstood, did not wholeheartedly comply, and so forth. All this adds
further to his confusion, so making any exercise of self-control even more
difficult.


An example of a similar unsuccessful struggle was related by Renee
in the <i>Autobiography of a Schizophrenic Girl</i>. How she finally did succumb
is told in this excerpt.


I received orders from the System. I did not hear the orders as voices;
yet they were as imperious as if uttered in a loud voice. While, for example,
I was preparing to do some typing, suddenly, without any warning, a force,
which was not an impulse but rather resembled a command, ordered me to burn
my right hand or the building in which I was. With all my strength I resisted
the order. I telephoned [her analyst] to tell her about it. Her voice, urging me
to listen to her and not to the System, reassured me.... but unfortunately
only for a moment.


An indescribable anguish squeezed my heart, an anguish no resolve could
allay. If I refused to obey, I felt guilty and cowardly for not daring, and the
anguish mounted. Then the order became more insistent. If, finally to obey,
I went to the fire and stretched out my hand, an intense feeling of guilt overcame
me as though I were doing something wicked, and the anxiety waxed
in proportion. I should say, however, that the latter alternative provoked the
greater disturbance, for I felt that if I obeyed the order, I should commit an
act irreparably damaging to my personality....


I had, too, the conviction that my behavior was deceitful. In reality, it
wasn't anything of the kind. I was deeply sincere. But if I disobeyed the System
to maintain the integrity of my personality, I was deceitful since I acted
as though I had no consideration for the order. If I obeyed it, I was equally
deceitful, since I did not agree to burn myself. I suffered horribly from the
orders and from the feeling of treachery so contrary to my character....


One day, trembling, I placed the back of my right hand on the incandescent

[p. <i>347</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00363&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Undoubtedly, Renee did struggle against the inner commands and
impulses. She succumbed to them in the vain hope that the inner tension
would be relieved. She, like most other similarly afflicted persons, reported
that little or no relief of tension was gained from following such
orders. The particular impulse itself may become less demanding, but
the anxiety continues; and now, added to the tension, is the demoralizing
knowledge that one was foolish and weak enough to follow the dictates
of a senseless command.


<i>Abulia</i>


In contrast to the inner force exerted by compulsions and obsessions,
there may exist a state of complete inability to exert one's will
power, or of having no will power to exert--that is, an experience of
<i>abulia</i>. The various disorders of volition considered so far have been
characterized by a feeling of being prompted by some external force, so
that the person experiencing it was no longer completely under his own
self-control. The individual was acting, so to speak, "against his will."
Abulia, in contrast, represents a total lack of will to direct or resist any
kind of internal or external impulse. An example of such a condition was
described by Dr. Heveroch's patient.


I am absent-minded, without energy or will. It is impossible for me to
reflect about something at will. My head feels like a washcloth. I have the
feeling of a madman, I don't perceive my will and do everything mechanically.
I can't get my eyes to stand still, don't know how to turn myself around; I do
everything without thought or feeling. If someone speaks to me, I am as if
without consciousness, without thought, and am unable to give an answer....
I, myself, can't bring the sensation of will, that is the sensation of the expression
of the will to the level of consciousness. (Heveroch, 1913, p. 427)


The experience of abulia is not just that of a simple loss of will or
will power. Every description of abulia I have found seems to have been
complicated by the addition of other experiences. The patient just cited
used the following phrases; "Everything in me is asleep," "Everything
around me is enveloped in a fog," "My hands are the hands of a ghost,"
"My mouth begins to speak without my knowing about it," and so on.
Not only is the experiential quality of will lacking, but feeling of unreality
and other inappropriate emotions act to complicate the entire
experience.


I have cited part of Renee's description of her inner struggle to
resist an "order from the System to burn my right hand." Somewhat later
in the course of her illness she found herself gradually enveloped in a
state of apathy and abulia. She described it as follows.

[p. <i>348</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00364&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I no longer received orders from the System: there was much less anxiety,
and the fear too affected me rarely. My usual keen sense of responsibility
was gone; I did not raise a finger to find work or to help my family. For the
greater part of the day I sat in a chair, gazing fixedly before me, or plunged
in the absorbed contemplation of a tiny spot,... but with what weariness!
The slightest movement required extraordinary effort, particularly to overcome
the first inertia. Once I had begun things became easier, but then I could not
stop. (Sechehaye, 1951, pp. 56-57)


Abulia, like apathy or anhedonia, is described as a dreamlike state
of unreality, in which the EDITOR function of ordinary consciousness
remains semivigilant. The EDITOR notes some fraction of passing events
and retains partial memory traces of them, thus providing a hazy record
of the total experience. But the EDITOR function has no control nor is it
in any way identified with the passing show. During abulia and apathy
the EDITOR is limited in its capacity of awareness and fixation, since it
plays no active part in the interaction between the apathetic organism
and his environment.


It will be recalled that Perceval doubted (but tried to obey) the
inner spirits or voices he heard. Many of the commands involved actions
that were dangerous to his welfare. On one occasion the conflict between
the orders and his own safety led to the following experience.


At last, one hour, under an access of chilling horror at my imagined loss
of honour, I was unable to prevent the surrender of my judgment. The act of
mind I describe, was accompanied with the sound of a slight crack, and the
sensation of a fibre breaking over the right temple ... accompanied by an apparently
additional surrender of the judgment. In fact, until now, I had retained
a kind of restraining power over my thoughts and belief; I now had
none; I could not resist the spiritual guilt and contamination of any thought, of
any suggestion. My will to choose, to think orderly, was entirely gone. I became
like one awake yet dreaming. (Perceval, 1838, pp. 60-61)


Perceval's sensation of something physical breaking or snapping is
not unique. Such an experience has been mentioned in several other
autobiographies as having occurred when there was some marked change
in mental content or experience. Whether the actual sensation occurred
or whether the description is no more than a figurative way of saying,
"My will was broken," is impossible to say.


<b>DISCUSSION</b>


<i>Will</i> or <i>volition</i> are terms used to designate a mental function
ordinarily related to experiences such as choosing, delaying, deciding,
and directing. In phenomenological accounts of an individual's mental
life, will and volition are rarely mentioned as independent functions or
processes. Volition is an attribute of experience in the same fashion that
pleasantness and unpleasantness are attributes of feelings, ideas, images,

[p. <i>349</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00365&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Disorders of volition are subjectively self-evident. Others may come
to gain knowledge of their occurrence, either by inference from behavioral
observations or by taking stock of the verbal descriptions of the
experiencer, and by comparing these descriptions with the memory of
their own experiences.


Disorders of volition are of two major sorts: (1) a need for greater
effort in the achievement of an act of will (decision) due to an unusual
force that opposes the normal mental process involved in such acts, and
(2) the weakening or loss of the mental capacity to exercise an act of
will. In both varieties the disorder is associated with a feeling of weakened
personal responsibility and a constriction of freedom in decision-making.


The experience of the increase in volitional effort that is required
to exercise one's will is associated with certain states and behaviors
called fixed ideas, obsessions, compulsions, irresistible impulses, and
inner commands. The differences between these phenomena depend
largely on the timing and vigor of the opposing force against which the
will must operate. There is nothing to indicate that weakness of will is of
itself pathological in any of these circumstances. The conditions under
which these difficulties in conation arise may or may not be abnormal.
The state becomes abnormal to the experiencer if it results in the feeling
of loss of or interference with his sense of responsibility. Fixed ideas,
compulsions, and the like are usually regarded by the experiencer as
nuisances; they interfere with his peace of mind but are of themselves
no indication of "loss of mind." Only when certain ideas, impulses, or
commands overwhelm the totality of his better judgment does the experiencer
agree to the possibility that for a shorter or longer period he
had indeed lost his mind.


Most psychopathological experiences involving disordered volition
are reported by the experiencer as possessing one or more of the following
features: an imperative, distasteful idea demands an inner strength to
resist that is near to or beyond the limit of his ability; the idea, thought,
or impulse intrudes on him persistently and he cannot stop, divert, or redirect
it; not only is he unable to control the idea, but, rather, he finds
himself controlled by it; most of his thoughts or impulses seem to him
utterly senseless, deprived of all ordinary values or meanings, so much so
that many become positively repulsive and cause him to behave in ways
contrary to his accustomed better judgment and desire. Disorders of
volition engender or carry with them feelings of anxiety, fear, and dread
that tend to make the total experience itself more vivid and confusing.

Abulia, the feeling of having lost one's will, is subjectively different
from those experiences that bear the necessity of increasing or using more
of one's volitional strength and is usually accompanied by other complex
and unusual inner states. Descriptions of lack of will are frequently associated
with descriptions of anhedonia and feelings of unreality. The
abulic individual complains of having lost all human feelings; he says
he is operating automatically, much as a mechanical man might do.
Abulia may overtake an individual suddenly, but the more usual account
indicates that it is realized only after a long inner struggle between the
person's normal inhibitions and the ideas, impulses, and commands that
he feels are externally imposed on his mind.
