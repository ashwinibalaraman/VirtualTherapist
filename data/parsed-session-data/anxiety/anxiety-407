What I have lived is in a large measure what I am. While
I don't know your motives for reading this book, I suspect
that in one way or another, either you or someone you love
has felt the gnawing suspicion of nothingness. This suspicion
is the most destructive, debilitating, and frightening
emotion in the range of human responses. Difficult to describe,
this suspicion suggests that the struggle you make
may be worthless, that the game is not worth the candle,
that even if you persist and even if you triumph, in the end
you will lie down forever having meant little to the world,
to the people in it now, or to those to follow. This is the
insidious feeling that must be anticipated and guarded
against.


The human mind and body can endure anything, provided
there is a conviction that the "game" is worthy of
the effort. This conviction has enabled man to withstand
the worst that fate and other men can conceive--witness the
persecution and perseverance of the Jews--the degradation
of human dignity occurring so often in the ghettoes of the
world. Look at our treatment of our fellows who are sick in

[p. <i>2</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When a man decides that the struggle is not worth the
effort, then a kind of death, absolute or relative, can be
predicted. How to anticipate this I don't know. Our predictive
devices for individuals aren't accurate. Perhaps one
could simply ask, "Can you resist pain, unrelenting and
unremitting and unlikely to be relieved?" We should not
ask the question, however, if we are not prepared to accept
responsibility for man's answer.


With me it began as a pain in my chest. It was acute and
fairly severe. At least I thought so at the time. I have withstood
much worse since, not without considerable whimpering
and bitching, I might add. Well, what could it be?
Indigestion? I gave voice to this thought, but a sneaky feeling
in the back of my mind began to give voice to its
thoughts as well: "No, it's not indigestion. It's probably
cancer or a heart attack." "No," I argued out loud, "it's
indigestion." But "that feeling" didn't hear me. And a slow
but growing panic moved over my mind and body.


Almost a month before this, my wife and I had gone to
her home to visit an aunt who was dying of cancer. She had
not been told, and we were to maintain a cheerful attitude
with her. I am sure that she knew, but she was pleasant and
optimistic during our visit.


We returned to school and I resumed studying for my
doctoral examinations coming up in October. My major
fields of study were counseling and school psychology. Like
most graduate students I was under considerable pressure.
How much of myself I had committed to this milestone in
my life I did not then know. Passing the examinations
seemed to represent some peak of achievement in my life
that even now I am unable to explain. I had to pass! To fail

[p. <i>3</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So the days dragged by. Studying, reading, talking with
other students, worrying. Nothing unusual. I was conscious
of a considerable amount of anxiety. But "So what," I
thought, "everybody else is ready to flip too." Finally the
big days came. We took our examinations--a day, and half
of another, of written exams. Then came the wait for the
verdict.


In about a week, I received a letter from the assistant dean
informing me that I had passed the written portion of the
tests. I was soon to report to a committee in my department
for oral presentations. This was scary, too. I knew the members
of my department, and I knew they thought I was a
good student. About the only question I can remember being
asked during this interview was, "What would be the
main focus of emphasis in a program to train counselors if
you could make the decisions?" I remember my answer too.
I said that I would require trainees to have access to intensive
and complete counseling and personal analysis themselves.
The point being, of course, that they must know
themselves and be at relative peace with what they are
before they can give others the help they need. How little
I knew of myself.

[p. <i>4</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Panic</b>


Then I experienced my first recognizable period of panic,
the first, that is, that I could relate to an outside event. The
chairman of my department congratulated me on passing
my exams and said that I had made one of the highest
recorded marks on the written materials. He went on to say
that he and other members of the department had the greatest
expectations for my future--that I would undoubtedly
make some significant contributions to the field of psychological
services in the future. One should be pleased with
such praise and encouragement, but I wasn't. I felt intense
panic over what it seemed to me that I now had to do. I now
had significant eyes on me and had to make some notable
contributions!


There may be no rest for the wicked, but compared to the
rest that anxious people get, they undoubtedly have a pastoral
life. I had successfully entered graduate school, had
been awarded a scholarship, passed two years of graduate
course work, completed my comprehensive examinations,
favorably impressed my major professors and my other instructors,
and now I had to make a significant contribution
to the field! There was no point at which I could rest. When
could I drop my partially pretended and consciously maintained
air of studiousness, perseverance, flexibility, and ease
of manner? I was in worse shape than I had been in before.
I might have been able to recoup somehow if I had failed,
but now that I had passed, what?


I must admit, however, that I see many of these things
only now. At that time I knew only that I was tired and
overwhelmed by feelings that were strange and powerful.
Fortunately, at this time I was finishing my formal course
work and all that remained was to plan, outline, and complete
a dissertation. All that remained--ha! Those of you

[p. <i>5</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>A period of coping</b>


One evening after a leisurely meal and some television
watching, I noticed a feeling of discomfort in my lower
chest. It felt like a knot. A dose of soda didn't seem to help.
By bedtime the knot had grown and with it a considerable
pain. It had penetrated to my back in sharp, piercing waves.
My mind shifted into high gear, and I began to consider the
things that it could be. Indigestion? No, it hurts too much
and it hasn't eased yet. Heart attack? No, I said to myself,
I'm too young. Nervous spasms? No, I didn't think I felt
particularly anxious. Ah, then the joker triumphantly
sprang from the deck, a malignancy! It was going to be
death for me! My head began to feel as if it had too much
blood in it. Anxiety danced madly in my stomach, demanding
exit through my mouth. And a crushed feeling, like a
childish hurt or resentment, settled on my shoulders. I complained
worriedly to my wife, not saying, of course, what
I suspected. She tried to reassure me, but I succeeded in
worrying her too.


Finally the pain eased and we went to bed. But I didn't
sleep for a long time. I went through every imaginable possibility.
I pictured myself in a hospital. The doctor told me
that I couldn't make it. I had six weeks. (Why do people
always have six weeks?) I went through those entire six
weeks, on to my final breath, my funeral, and wonder of
wonders, on to my wife's subsequent period of mourning,
her recovery, new friendships, a courtship, and finally remarriage,
and my resulting jealousy. I know this sounds
ridiculous, but this is what I was doing. It would be ludicrous

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My episode of panic over the chest pain gradually subsided
over the next few days, and for a week or so things
went along about as usual. I would have been willing, I
think, to accept a psychosomatic explanation for this if it
had occurred prior to taking and passing my comprehensive
doctoral exams. But those were behind me now, and it
seemed logical to assume that if this was a somatic reaction
to stress it would have occurred before, not after, I took my
exams. My logic, I have found, is not always in keeping
with my emotional reactions!


Things went on as before, But inevitably, another night
came with another attack. My panic and unbridled fantasies
increased. After this attack, I was frightened enough to go
to the infirmary. The doctor there gave me a careful physical
examination and took a comprehensive history. He prescribed
some drug (a sedative) and suggested a bland diet
for a few days. Well, this calmed me down for another week
or two. However, soon more pain and a more intense reaction
from me. I was in a state of near panic. I was finally and
completely convinced that I was dying.


On my next visit, the doctor could see that I was distraught.
He made an appointment for a stomach x-ray and
for a kidney study. Back in the infirmary a few days later,
I felt my level of anxiety somewhat allayed, probably by the
attention I was getting.


The stomach x-ray was suggestive of a lesion in the
duodenum. In other words, an ulcer. What a relief to learn
this! There really was something physically wrong with me.
So, when I went on a bland diet with medication and milk,
my stomach calmed down a bit. By now my doctor had
suggested psychiatric help for me. I was a little stunned at
this suggestion. "You mean I've got a neurotic stomach?" I

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I tried. My friend, and major professor, tried. But I was
beyond the point of "reconstruction" at the time. The
decompensation process was in full momentum. There was
the added obstacle of my prior deception in my own department.
I had spent so much time and effort on my public
personality that I found it impossible to drop it. I gave some
flimsy excuse after a couple of sessions and my counselor
permitted me to withdraw. I wish now that he had insisted
that I stay with him. But if the decision didn't come from
me, it probably would have been meaningless. Besides, I am
sure insistence would be contrary to his basic beliefs concerning
the helping relationship. I wonder how he feels
about this now. I was beyond the point of making anything
like a mature, capable decision about myself. I didn't know
what to do or whom to turn to. My resources and strengths
were exhausted and my defenses, so laboriously built, collapsed.


<b>Another day, another doctor</b>


We went to my wife's folks' home for the Christmas
holidays. Talking about my newly discovered ulcer and my
diet was some relief. And for two or three days, I had some
respite. But now the episodes were coming more frequently
and were more damaging and frightening. Finally, I woke on
the fifth morning of our vacation with a distraught feeling
and with profound nausea. My mother-in-law called the
doctor. He looked me over, decided it must be the ulcer, and
prescribed something for nausea.

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt a little better, and we went over to my folks' house
for a few days. On Christmas day I couldn't get out of the
bed. I was so nauseated and so miserable that I could barely
talk. Another doctor called. Still more medication. He told
me some years later that he thought at the time that I was
having a "nervous nausea." But he didn't say anything
then. In fact, no one had yet said, "You are having a depressive-emotional
attack. There's nothing physically wrong
with your stomach."


That afternoon my mother called an internist in the city,
an older and wise man. He was cautious and careful and
sympathetic and he found out what was wrong with me,
but he didn't anticipate its severity. At least he didn't tell
me if he did.


That afternoon I was admitted into the hospital in the
city for diagnostic study. Dr. W. took a careful history and
listened to my long tale of woe. After a thorough physical
exam, he ordered an electrocardiogram. When I learned that
he had done that, I really was in a tizzy! I tried to appear
casual when I asked if he suspected some cardiac trouble.
"No," he replied, "but I want to do a thorough check on
everything that may possibly be wrong." I was convinced
he was lying. He had heard something that sounded bad in
my heart! I was convinced of that. I now imagined myself
a lifelong invalid or saw myself dropping over dead at any
moment.


He left and after awhile a young technician came in
wheeling the electrocardiograph machine. She seemed
rather uncertain of herself as she attached the leads. I interpreted
her behavior as being due to her knowledge that I
was very sick. Certainly her rather grim manner did nothing
to reassure me. She finally left and I was alone again.


In trying to capture in words my predominant feelings at
this time, all I can come up with is "I felt bad." I could

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then Dr. W. came back with a copy of the EKG tape in
his hand. "Well," he says, "we're going to have to take
another one." "Oh Lord," I groaned to myself, "I must
really be in bad shape." But all I said out loud was a calm,
"Why?"


"The first test wasn't run properly." He seemed to me to
be calculatingly casual, and I didn't believe him for a
minute. Later that night I had another period of panic and
despair. I cried bitterly late that night, alone in my room,
convinced I was dying.


More tests and more probing, including an examination
for possible kidney damage. It's amazing what terrible
shape you are in when somebody really looks! But all of this
testing yielded nothing.


Dr. W. came in my room and sat on the side of the bed.
He went over the results of all the lab studies and x-rays.
"There's nothing wrong with your heart. The first test was
not done properly and the second was perfectly normal. The
cystoscopic examination revealed no kidney disorder. And
the x-ray showed no ulcer." No ulcer! I was really worried
since they had found nothing. "If you've had an ulcer," he
continued, "I can see no trace of it now." "Son," he said,
"you've just got to change your way of life. You're pushing
yourself to the point of exhaustion." I thanked him and
soon left the hospital, somewhat relieved.


After a day or so, my wife and I headed back to school.
I was so beaten and felt so bad that I had to lie down in the
back seat of the car most of the way while she drove. We
got back to school and to our apartment. And we went back
to our jobs--me to class and work as a teaching assistant-
she, back to her work at the university library.

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Final decline</b>


Stress, fear, anxiety, and panic are part of everyone's life
at some time. These burdens are hard to bear even when one
has support and help. Alone, you are crushed, without hope
or the promise of relief. Fortunately I did not have to face
these trials alone. My wife, in every sense, is a part of me.


I think many times of the anxiety, pain, and heartache
that my wife has suffered, with and because of me. I'm sorry
that it has been this way for her. But I'm selfishly glad that
I had her with me for comforting, for her courage, and for
the meaning she has given my life. Without her, I'm convinced,
I wouldn't be writing these words now. And her
courage has been much greater than that of simply caring
for me. And much more demanding because she has insisted
that I am and can be somebody, like everybody else. And
she has not fallen into the easier snare of taking over for me
and letting me drift through life uninvolved. She is involved
with me. I like her.


But school and my work were no easier. I submerged
myself in studying, trying to force my wildly fluctuating
emotions to settle down. I studied and read. I wrote papers
and reviewed many more books and journal articles than
was necessary for my course work. Sometimes, though, I
would read three or four pages and suddenly realize that I
didn't have the vaguest notion what I had read. Then I'd go
back and read it all over again. Sometimes I would be in
such agony that I would almost have to cry aloud in the
library. Then I would go outside until I felt I was under
control again. I read and worked until I finally was in such
misery that I couldn't read at all.


I told two of my professors that I was having panic attacks
and depressions. They were all sympathetic and supportive.
I talked with the head of my department about my

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My illness had begun suddenly and rather severely. For
three months I had struggled and had maintained my outward
equilibrium, and had stayed on my teaching job and
in my doctoral program. But now the disorganization was
precipitous. I was rapidly losing my ability and will to
recover and reorganize. Panic and depressive attacks were
besetting me with increased frequency and with more awesome
force. Now I was having four or five attacks a day.
Attacks so beyond my control that I literally had to hide
when I knew they were coming. If I could get to my apartment,
I would sit huddled against the wall in a corner with
my knees drawn up to my chest, clinging to them tightly.
And my body would shake like that of a malaria victim and
I would cry in anguish and pain. Sometimes I would pace
the floor, my insides quivering, with every nerve in my
body seemingly on the surface of my skin, being scorched
by the movement of the air.


When the attacks subsided, I did my job as best I could,
went to class, wrote papers, listened to lectures, and took the
final exams in the last of the course work I had to take.


Somehow I made A's on all of this work. How I did this,
I don't really know. I did manage to pull myself together for
extended periods of time. But these periods were becoming
shorter and shorter. Finally, the semester was over, and so
was I.


I called the school psychiatrist who had seen me two or
three times and told him that I was in a panic state, that I
could no longer tolerate it. I had to have some help. Something

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I lay in the bed at the infirmary thinking that at last I
would get some relief. I was given tranquilizers and, at
night, sleeping medication. But it was too little, too late.


I didn't calm down. I was in a state of acute anxiety and
agitated depression. The psychiatrist came in twice a day for
brief sessions and I think he felt I was calming down a bit.
The fact was that I hurt terribly every minute. Occasionally
I had a few moments of relative calm and ease. When these
moments came, I thought, "Ah, now things will get better.
I'll get out of here and finish my degree and maybe even
write a book about the horror of mental illness! I'll tell the
world about my tragic suffering and show them by my
brave and noble works how people with emotional disorders
can contribute to society." I know this is asinine, but
it's really what I was thinking. I felt ennobled, cleansed
through suffering, compassionate, rather more fortunate
than those poor clods who led such meaningless lives. My
humbling was yet to come. But I didn't know it then.


The psychiatrist let me go home after three or four days.
There my newfound sense of noble martyrdom lasted about
six hours. I entered the final decline. I soon was so paralyzed
with psychic pain that I was almost comatose. I couldn't eat
at all and the only sleep I got was in fifteen or twenty
minute exhausted periods. I couldn't talk to anyone or even
sit up. I couldn't read or watch television, and finally I
couldn't hold my head up off my chest. I was in desperate
agony.


My mother had stopped by a few days before this. She

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mother and my wife tried to help: hot soup, back
rubs, aspirins, quiet, and dark rooms. What those few days
must have done to them!


There was no turning back from my destination. They
tried to take me for walks. The psychiatrist must have advised
them to keep me busy. Each of them would hold one
arm, propping me up. I remember how cold it was. And we
walked, and we walked. Finally I couldn't even walk.


In the free moments we talked. We talked about many
things. Old wounds and old disappointments; guilts for
things done and not done, for things said and not said; for
help and sustenance given or withheld. The anguish of my
wife was for someone she loved and could not help. That
of my mother, for someone she loved and could not help
and who was suffering, she was convinced, largely because
of her. I guess every mother believes in her heart of hearts
that she is responsible for what she has nurtured. In that
sense, mothers are doomed (privileged?) to live the lives of
their children and to suffer their anguish and savor their
triumphs. So we wallowed in anguish, in fear, in guilt, and
in self-reproach. Until we finally had to stop.


We all knew that I had to have care, probably in a hospital.
My wife and mother left me in the care of a friend, and
I was now so distraught that it's probably a good thing that
they did. They went to see the college psychiatrist who had
been treating me. He agreed that his "first aid" had failed,
and they arranged to have me admitted to the psychiatric
ward of the student health center and hospital on the campus.


We made our way fearfully up those steps and to the

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Soon, I was admitted. Before I walked down the hall, my
wife and my mother kissed me and uttered sounds of comfort
and hope. As I walked away, I knew that something in
my life had ended, an era was over and a time of transition
had come.


It was to be nearly six months before I was to walk back
down that corridor to leave the hospital. And I was to come
to know that hell has no fear for him who has been there.
And I would have been there before I came back to the
world.
