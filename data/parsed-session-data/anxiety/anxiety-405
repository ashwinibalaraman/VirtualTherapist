<b>Turning away from unilevel reality</b>


Faster, stronger and more lasting. A poet said once in
a fairly brutal but truthful way: "I do not live, and I do
not want to live, and I will say more -- I would live
a beautiful life -- I spit at the pig&apos;s survival."


Life is such without a hierarchy of values, without
a consideration of the multilevelness of life, without ideas.
It is a unilevel, statistical, adjusting, sensual life with intelligence
in the service of primitive instincts. It is "ordinary"
life. It is a sensual, instinctive union but it is not a union
of respect, love and recognition in each of his originality,
psychic richness, unrepeatability and uniqueness.


Life begins only with a hierarchy. Only then, when we
have developmental nuclei to "rise above", when slowly we
grasp the hierarchy -- does humanization begin.


If we "touch" the longing for a hierarchy, we begin to
experience inner conflicts, drama, and even, sometimes,
tragedy. Only such experiences make from the species man
-- individual man.


The grasping of these hierarchical values, the grasping
of "the spaces above" gives us new forces, new dynamics
of experience -- the dynamics of astonishment with oneself,
disquietude with oneself, dissatisfaction with oneself, the
feeling of guilt. Only such conditions allow us the possibility
of "rising" and grasping the new reality.


This grasping of a "new reality" is presented in a very
subtle way by Juliusz Slowacki in "Balladyna".


Soar to the dawn, pierce through its purple;<br />
Glide through the dew, gather its pearls;<br />
Rise to a cloud, discern the blue<br />
And maybe a rainbow thread somewhere wavers<br />
Then seize it on your spindle<br />
And weave, and weave, and weave.

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We don&apos;t know anything concrete about the higher levels
of reality. In some experiences we grasp levels which are
a bit higher than the levels approchable by normal statistics:
in ideal love, in friendship, in the realization of great and
important social ideas, and so on. But in every case -- only
the multilevelness of grasping and experiencing reality gives
us the possibility, and perhaps the hope of reaching its
higher levels.


The experiences of great mystics, writers or poets such
as Kafka, Rilke, Slowacki are examples of this. The greatest
sculptures or paintings give a certain insight into this
unusual reality. We can reach this reality through empathy,
renouncement, contemplation and ecstasy, and a desire for
perfection.


Only in these conditions where we reach, and usually
partially, that which is called transcendental, are we able
to grasp this transcendental reality in the rather unclear,
unsure area between mystical experiences and that which
"perhaps" could appear from "true transcendence" during
these mystical experiences.


However -- multilevelness and only multilevelness.
Kierkegaard outlined the esthetical, ethical and religious
phases in developmnet. Only the last one can bring us
near to transcendence, to the absolute, to a completely
different reality than the everyday, statistical one. Of course,
this is the individual and mystical religiousness expressing
the need of being "tête à tête" with transcendence.


It is an expression of unofficial, non-institutional,
non-commanding, unauthoritative transcendence which is
reached through a difficult a-statistical way, through a
difficult climbing up a narrow path, through difficult
intellectual, original, mystical experiences, through experiences
of love.

<b>Compulsions to be free</b>


On some levels of development --- it is necessary to be
characterized by obsessions. They result in emotional forces
which cause us to experience something very exclusively,
to remember something; to build resistance in the pursuit

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And if someone is also dynamic -- the obsessions have
to connect with compulsions; one has to do something, to
change something through the strength of intuition and
effective acting. One must do something for selfhood
fundamentally; one must oppose something; one must
concentrate on something in an active way.


Changeability and the "passage of all values" -- terrifies.
It is necessary to stop, in some way, this changeability; it
is necessary to persist, to do something, to oppose something,
to discriminate against something, to choose something, to
accept something.


There are some overpowering needs to arrest oneself
in time and space, to never let go of certain feelings ... some
horrific, inhuman, and perhaps superhuman tendencies to
arrest oneself, to be unchangeable, to go morbidly into the
depths, not to submit to changeability, to flux and to flow.


There is in this a strong desire to be liberated from
subordination to the element of time, time which passes
superficially without attachment to us, to our personalities.


We have to stop ourselves in order not to be horrified
by changeability and by ourselves; we have to stop ourselves
in order not to identify morbidly with ourselves and with
others; we must stop ourselves in order to forecast some
fragments of our immortality, even though this immortality
was the most apparent.


Accept obsessions and compulsions as one of the ways
to development, even though this development is most
morbid, and as long as it is not dull and constantly an
escape. It is an apparent but human consolation.

<b>Paradox -- the joy of life and the sadness of death</b>


We are gifted with senses from which we draw many aural,
visual, tactile, gustatory, olfactory and sexual experiences.
Sensory feelings connected with emotional ones give us
esthetic, moral and social experiences of various scope and
multilevel depth. Sensory feelings connected with intellectual
and emotional ones bring us into an experiental -- mental,

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is a tragic, existential antinomy between the more
refined experiences afforded by senses, feelings and intellect
which attract us and pervade us with joy, and experiences
afforded by the same receptors and functions which cause
us pain, illness, death, funeral experiences and before --
dissolution and nonexistence.


These antinomies are present in some fundamental existential
collisions, in constant encounters, cause breakdowns, and
at the same time create strong tendencies toward finding
the meaning of life, the sense of existence.


There is pain in joy, enthusiasm in suffering; there appears
multilevelness of experiences, the problem of transcendence
of temporality and of a reaching to the absolute.


Perhaps without these contradictions, without this "fear
and trembling", without these tensions there is no possibility
of reaching the absolute.

<b>The sadness of a child</b>


There are two kinds of sadness in a child. Here is one
of them: Once, on a street in front of her home, I saw
a child, about two-and-a-half, with tears on her face. She
turned to me and cried: "Take me to my kitten; my kitten
ran away and I want to go to him". She repeated this
several times with great emotion grasping her entire little
personality. I observed her for a long time; this intensivity of
feelings was not connected with depth and constancy, though
it was sincere and it was grasping the whole personality of
a child. In a few minutes there was nothing of this sadness.
It was a nice sadness, an attractive child&apos;s sadness, sadness
which does not tear down, is not tragic or even dramatic.


We have another kind of child&apos;s sadness, for example
after the death of his parents. A child may fall into the

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, the older child, several years older or a teenager,
sensitive and emotionally rich -- expresses tragic, autonomic,
so to say. authentic sadness. With such sadness we have
normal external activities but the child ceases moving
internally, experiences a spasm which is characteristic of the
tragic difference and deprivation of the things important to
him. It is a disappointment of an existential and metaphysical
type.


The child is deprived of great good. He understands his
situation, understands that this deprivation is irreversible,
that fundamentally nothing will change from the point of his
unique, unrepeatable, so to say, essential good.


Not all, but some of this content and above all -- mood
is shown in the Pasternak movie "Doctor Zhivago"; it is
the scene in the cemetery and the behavior of the child,
the hero of the movie, the future doctor Zhivago.


There is a scene of the dead mother in the coffin,
put into the grave for eternity; there is the kindness and
friendliness of his relatives which cannot compensate for
his mother&apos;s love because it cannot be replaced, because
nothing can replace a mother&apos;s love.


There is an atmosphere of beauty in the funeral song,
which changes nothing in the actual situation. Add there
is the loneliness of a child upon his return home to the place
where she had lived and where now exists only her vision.
It is the recognition of the waxy immobility of her face,
immobility of her figure and of something else ... something
else... burying her in the ground.

<b>A contribution to the psychology of expression</b>


The psychology of expression is in its infancy in a scientific
sense, but we still return to it to some extent in the
metaphysical sense. Of course, all systems working on
psychosomatic problems, on the correlation between bodily
types and character types, touch this problem.


It is not my intention to write a short scientific treatise on

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Such an attitude is characterized by impetuosity, passion,
sudden tension and relaxation, outbursts, inclination
with others.


There is something of the strong pressure of passion,
of the tactile -- sensual attitudes in which the desire for
touch, drink and other things are manifested externally very
strongly.


I have observed, hundred of times, the way such individuals
drink. It is the opening of their lips, the tilting of the cup
containig the drink to their now swollen, widely "outspread"
lips, the adhering to the lip of the cup, together with closing
of the eyes, strong tension of the whole body, strong concentration
without the possibility of relation of almost "painful
joy" during the drinking.


Of course, it is hard to base a full typological diagnosis
on such an attitude. It is only a fairly narrow fragment
of diagnosis. However, it gives a certain basis for a diagnosis,
for looking for correlations. At any rate, this first fragmentary
view of the human allows one to grasp the psychology
of expression, though in a narrow way.

<b>On the prophylaxies of anxieties</b>


I knew a girl with a logical and reasonable mentality. In
the first few years of school she did not talk spontaneously
to her friends -- she only answered when spoken to.


Outside of school, in everyday matters she was impractical,
unsure; she had to be assured that she understood practical
matters and could do them. And indeed, being very intelligent
she could do these matters very well and thoroughly. She was
not shy with her family, on whom she depended very much.
She was with her mother and father all the time. Before
she went to bed she had to have emotional contact with.

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She had outstanding global abilities and abilities for
intravertive insight in stories about animals of the forest,
imaginary figures. She noticed very early "matters of death".
When she was 4 or 5 years old she learned that, after
death, people are thrown into "a hole" in the ground. She
did not want to look at death -- she tried to wall it out;
she did not want to transfer it to her beloved world.


Sometimes she fought with anxiety, "forced" by her
consciousness. She did not like to talk about it much. It
seemed to her that talking about it would discover and
bring to light those matters which she put to one side,
anxious matters, unbearable matters.


There appeared occasionally, however, an inclination to
deal with these "hidden" matters. Though always under
great tension, she was fascinated with prohibited terms,
terms having a close relation with death. Immediately after,
she became apparently indifferent and, above all, externally
indifferent. She fortified herself through criticism of authors
of poems, novels or treatises concerned with the problems
of death. Sometimes she questioned her father in a calm
way which did not show the depth of her feelings and
disturbances.


These are childish but elaborated forms of prophylaxis
through slow discovery -- slow in order not to cause
breakdown. This slow discovery of a secret was the school
of initiation into one of the most cruel, developmental and
crushing experiences in the human experiment -- from this,
and not of this world.


8.11.63


<b>Intellectual essence and emotional essence</b>


I have thought about this problem but only very onesidedly.
What does intellectual essence, essence in ideals and concepts,
cognitive essence mean for man?


If one touches on this problem in an intellectual sense
only, and not in an experimental sense, one is reminded
of the cosiderations of Plato and Aristotle about which is

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We do not always realize that these intellectual essences
have one quality: they are common to all people -- not
in the sense of emotional closeness through love, but in
the sense of the condition of "sine qua non" to atrophy, to
the nonexistence of individual and psychophysiological
separateness of man, this uniqueness and unrepeatability.


If the intellectual is only permanent and unchangeable, it
means it is undifferentiated, does not assume the human
separateness, the permanency of human feelings and
so-called immortality. It is permanent in universality, and
impermanent in individuality.


Ideas, abstract activities are alike, are similar, so that
they exclude variety which is an essenial quality in the
instincts and feelings of man.


The above-mentioned philosophers thought that the future
belonged to thinking, to abstraction, to ideas. They put human
instincts and feelings on a low level and condemned them
to atrophy in development. Angels of St. Thomas are not
only immaterial creatures but also insensitive -- they are
"minds" or "intellects". In this way the intellectual essence
is no longer a differentiated one, is no longer essence for
individual people, but is essence for all.


This is opposite to existentialism, which assumes a hierarchy
of reality. A true existentialism must be at the same time
an individual existentialism, in the sense of emotional essence.


If I am an individual, if I have needs for indentification,
developmment and empathy, if I want to be unique,
unrepeatable, if I want the same for others -- that is to
say, I want to see them as separate and unrepeatable --
my essence must be emotional.


I desire lasting friendship and unrepeatable, unique feelings;
I want to have deep interests. The same talents I now
have, in my more or less infantile longing, I want to keep
in transcendental life.


Essence is a value which I would not renounce because
it determines the meaning of my life. Should I have to

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So the human being is not a homo sapiens but homo
emotionalis, in, of course, the sense of higher emotions,
feelings.


6.02.64


<b>Do not oppose personal evil</b>


In the case of "intoxication" with difficult experiences,
hurt and humilation, people are ready not only not to
defend themselves but they are ready to deepen the psychic
and physical wounds, forced on them by fate, and to destroy
themselves.


These are certain kinds of intravertive reactions when
even a child does not react to very distinct injustice and
wrong-doings. He waits for injustice to right itself, to balance
itself. He manifests great pride and independence and strong
feeling of dignity. It is as if the child were a teacher of
adults, parents and educators. He waits for the adults to
understand their mistakes and remove from themselves their
egoistic ambitions, correct themelves and rise to a higher
level of reasoning and empathy.


In this attitude is something of an appeal to transcendence,
to Providence, to the levels of autonomy, and human
authentism. It is not always possible; most often it is
impossible to wait for justice, valuation and moral
compensation of a wrong. Very often such fulfilment does
not happen at all. Too "decisive" people consider
it humiliating to correct ther defects because of the sad,
almost transcendental attitude of a child.


But perhaps even in such cases there comes some
fulfilment, some sublimation of a child&apos;s attitude. There
develops in him a "shying away from" average constellations&apos;
of persons and leanings toward well chosen people with whom
he maintains a close relationship.


There grows in the child something of autonomy,
independence, and authentism. There is created in him an
attitude of heroism expressing itself in very subtle gestures

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Loftiness of Slogans and dullness of reality</b>


The strength of the ideal must be great even though
only a few people represent the ideal.


Why do we talk about the greatness of the ideal?&apos;
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical but the greater the ideal, the
greater the number of lies contained in the so-called loftyslogans
of people. The pervasion of lofty slogans suffuse and
daze us. Politicians, in their long and short speeches, and
persons running for parliament tell us about the ideal. And
in everyday life, fiancees, the young and not young married
couples, so-called friends, co-workers tell each other these
slogans.


There is some need to show off, to present oneself near
to the ideal, in spite of one&apos;s being a great distance from
this ideal; there is a need to portray closeness to this ideal.


My opposition to the lies hidden in slogans is expressed
by Ibsen in the well-known saying from "Wild duck": "Why
do we talk about ideals, if we have a better expression for
this -- a lie".


Everywhere we notice prosaic kindness, artificiality in
behavior, a desire to introduce ourselves as better, and
then ... then the return to the "shallower" trend of one&apos;s
own egoistic, instinctive, materialistic and integrated self
on a low level of needs.


We are raised surrounded by such a multitide of illusions
and untrue slogans, make-believe and underhanded tactics
that sometimes -- very seldom having ascertained the
contradictions between truth and illusion -- we wonder
about it very much, and we are surprised. No wonder,
because all around us are lies and slogans -- illusions.


Regarding persons who are near us in everyday life, and
whom we think are our friends, and whom we think are
decent, unselfish, friendly -- we change our opinion about.

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We are surprised and disquieted at this phenomenon but
if we had a better and more vigilant imagination, we would
have seen that the majority of human attitudes have nothing
in common with the ideal reality which is suggested, by
them, to us, consciously or half-consciously.


But I will come back to the previous problem: What
does it mean when people want to appear better than
they are? There exists an unlegislated "harmony", an ideal
system of reality which forces people to He, to endear
to them this ideal of a "higher" reality which we cannot
see, and, lastly, which we want to introduce through our
tendencies to appear closer to the ideal.


But our personality, hidden under a primitive and
self-preserving surface, contains many phenomena and
tensions, in fact, control us -- and only from time to time,
in the case of suffering and conflicts, illness and death
do we create a small but authentic path to this hierarchical
world of different reality. We want to grasp a small ray
of the "kingdom not of this world".


7.08.64


<b>The power of evil and unverified opinion</b>


I still return to old Ibsen and his aphorism from "Wild
duck": "Why do we talk about ideals when we have a better
expression for this -- a lie".


A true smile, friendliness, "truth" is a very rare phenomenon,
because the actual attitude displayed by "humans"
consists of "sticky smiles" in the service of self-interest.
The unexperienced smile of a child or saint is very rare;
however, a fake smile, which is visible for one who can
read an expression and external attitudes, is an everyday
phenomenon. True friendliness is a very rare phenomenon.
In human relationships there is something of hate.


Can you belive that the interest aroused in someone who
grasped a concrete problem in an interesting way, or who
recited a poem nicely -- can actually cause in someone
else who has no inclination toward poetry or philosophy --
envy, apprehension, suspicion? These almost non-existent

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This is like the envy of a lawyer when someone becomes
a bishop; this is like envy of a social worker who predicts
the success of an engineer.


And this jealous person can have social respect, be thought
of as a man with high morals, and a Christian known for
his great causes. And such an individual can destroy another,
can make allusions about the bad points of another, can do
harm by competent criticism. He can give imagined facts.


For such an individual truth does not exist. First, motives
are imagined, and then he forgets that these facts were
made up and he elaborates them and creates a situation,
almost without blunder, which is untrue and which contains
systematized lies.


But it is a matter of pragmatism, of "attitude", of life
efficiency. And such efficiency is great, we can observe it
in various countries, at meetings and so on. The most
important thing is the fact that such a weapon is very
efficient.


University profesors, physicians, engineers, artist accept
such opinions thus giving proof that the source, that the
criterion, that the method of checking in everyday life
does not lie in a desire for objectivity and is not concerned
with the need for verification.


There is something in human nature which causes fascination
with apparent dangers, which must have an ally, which
must attack, which is -- as a matter of fact -- ruthless
and cruel.


In man there is the need to fight, trap, hunt, and roam,
and above all -- power over others. And one more thing...
the need of disapproval, negation and weakening of all
true thoughts and custom. It is something of a "democratic"
lie to destroy others and something of disloyalty toward
that which is true and pure in the filth of this world.


That is why I like psychoneurotics, schizophrenics and
pathological worlds. Because, here, there are no lies, no
"as if" attitudes. Sadness and tragedy are distinct, joy and
friendliness are expressed, revolt is decided; immobility
and indifference or dislike -- clear; despair -- tangible.
The morality of the psychiatric hospital -- immorality of

[p. <i>77</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I think that we should go into dynamisms of this difference,
into the dynamisms and reasons for psychic clearness in
the "morbid" worlds in order to transfer some of them
into the everyday, supposedly "healthy world".

<b>The existentialism of a madman</b>


The impossibility of reaching for a solution or understanding
of fundamental matters of the sense of life forces a change
in the level of emotional attitude, the levels of reasoning,
of wants, of the hierarchy of values and of the hierarchy
of reality.


We become satiated, we become so saturated with the
reality of one level that we fall into discouragement, into
the experience of barrenness, into feeling that the experience
on the present level can give us nothing. We force ourselves
to a higher level which is perhaps not approchable to all,
but which is often as concrete as is everyday reality
for some individuals, for some groups of people.


The world of intuitive recognition, the mystical world, the
world of dreams -- in the systematization and description
-- becomes "different", becomes a higher level of reality
into which we slowly enter. In this way grows our different
perception of external and internal worlds.


And one more point: our recognition stops being perceptive
recognition in the previous sense. It also stops being the
perception connected with analytic and discursive reasoning.
It becomes the recognition through emotional-instinctive
rational connections with some subordination of the last
one to the first two. The rational elements which are
contained in this recognition become -- through these
connections -- less rational and more intuitive.


So, we enter into a different reality which is higher in
respect to level; we enter into it during the gradual
changing of cognitive or discovery methods.


This entrance into a new reality causes change, some
devastating in our attitude toward our former external and
internal reality. There appear astonishment and disquietude

[p. <i>78</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We begin to experience shame and guilt that we were
in that reality -- toward ourselves and toward others. We
begin to feel ashamed of ourselves and of others; we begin
to be dissatisfied with ourselves and others, but above
all -- with ourselves.


We begin to see clearly that which is "lower" and "higher"
in us. We begin to see that which "is" and that which
"ought to be". We see analogous things in our inner milieu.
We want to separate ourselves from the previous "I" --
in the sense of "our true", more autonomous and authentic
"I".


We want to handle the influence of the environment on
us in the same way. We wish to choose an independent,
authentic, closer-to-the-ideal self and turn away from the
dependent, primitive and adjusted self.


So, we begin the work of negation in our inner and external
environment. We begin to be objective toward ourselves
and more subjective toward others; we begin to treat
them as subjects with regard for their unrepeatable, developmental
and individual selves.


Such an attitude draws us to others, we grasp them in
their own variety, in their better or worse aspects; we
feel sympathy toward them; we express our help and
understanding though we may not agree with some forms
of their behavior.


Thus come about certain fundamental changes in our
disposing and directing center. We are not directed by different
motivations, whims, and caprices or other stimuli
deriving from our primitive instincts.


Our numerous disposing and directing centres organize
themselves into one, which is closer to the personality, a
unity of fundamental psychic, self-conscious, self-chosen
and self-education experience. It is like a second psychic
birth, a second unity in which we take our development in
"our hands".


We feel that some structures, some qualities, some interests,
some emotional relations become matters of indifference
to us while others, unique, unrepeatable and exclusive, we

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

These qualities, these concerns become like essence to
us, an essence without which we could not live and the
loss of which would destroy the meaning of our existence.
Simply our life would have no value for us.


In this way we become determined, independent from our
external environment and from our lower inner milieu. We
identify with our higher subjective, and perhaps objective,
reality. At the same time we feel clearly the rights of
others to the same existence and essence, the rights of others
to a chosen union with us on the basis of the right of
absolute independence, unrepeatability and uniqueness of
human beings.

<b>One cannot have too rich an imagination or empathy</b>


Demands of adjustment to everyday life, to social life
and to the so-called norm are so great that hardly anyone
does not undergo it. One cannot have a too rich and
deep imagination because it could lead him to "unreal"
worlds, to excessive oversubtlety, to breaking away from
everyday reality, to schizophrenic and psychoneurotic worlds.


One cannot reject meat because it is physically and
psychically unhealthy, because it would be mocked and even
derided. One cannot ignore fashion because it draws excessive
attention. One cannot be too dutiful and too responsible
a physician because it causes dislike and jealousy. One
cannot take a too small fee for educational, medical, or
lawyer&apos;s service because it would counteract the interest of
the group.


One cannot be an ascetic because it is suspicious and
looks like an illness. One cannot talk in company about
matters of the meaning of life, about psychological,
metaphysical and mystical matters because it is boring and
does not let one ramble from subject to subject, and also
because the majority of people do not have anything to say
on these subjects.


One cannot have too much empathy because some degree
of egoism is a norm from which one cannot depart for fear

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One should always know the limits of his responsibility.
One cannot base his responsibility on a steadily growing
sensitivity which does not allow him rest and reassurance.


We have defensive forces in order to oppose this excessive
sensitivity and imagination. We have to forget about death
and funerals; we must make contact with life; we must
stop remembering because too much thinking of all would
lead us to despair, mental illness or suicide. We also display
primitiveness, brutality and aggression in the service of
our instinct of self-preservation.


It is necessary to know well what is more important,
what is real and what is fantastical, what is substantial and
what is spiritual. One cannot compare the importance of
mystical, esthetic and moral experiences to experiences
connected with sleep, eating, health, satisfaction of the
sexual instinct.


We cannot be obsessive, we cannot repeatedly experience
crimes, rapes, blood, the dead body in decay and so on.


We have to separate ourselves from that by a wall of
forgetfulness, by a wall of inattention. How much more
lofty is the smell of a roast than the smell of dead bodies;
how much nobler is the smell of alcohol than the excessively
subtle smell of flowers? Both are important but the proportion
is one to a hundred and we must see this proportion clearly
-- unless we are psychoneurotics or schizophrenics. But
mental illness on the borderline of this illness is the most
difficult matter. Stay as far away as possible from such
matters!

<b>Astral experiences</b>


Theosophical and antroposophical experiences in the area
of spiritual life (which are full of chaos and option), concern

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Not all can participate in these experiences because
they concern only those with special spiritual qualities,
with special life histories -- persons who have autonomic
factors.


This are the states of separation from that which we
call "lower bodies", that is to say, of lower bodies from
"higher bodies" -- the separations which allow independence
for the latter.


Perhaps psychoneurotics and schizophrenics -- especially
some kinds -- know something about it, because these
phenomena are connected with the ability for psychic
looseness, for the breaking of the personality into two
or three persons, often into lower and higher, which
takes place through a "split" into two different existences,
also perhaps lower and higher.


This development goes through inner conflicts, through
maladjustment to lower reality and adjustment to higher
one. Such individuals have special predispositions to such
transformations. They are concerned with the feeling of
the lack of meaning of life, of adjustment to integrated
everyday forms of behavior.


They have a strong longing for "getting beyond oneself" ;
they have strong needs to experience day dreams,
to systematize them and make from them -- a shaped
reality; they have a need to transfer the important
material of life into the area of the "unknowable".


In the case of great tension and an usually difficult
experience there can occur this split into "body" and
"soul": into a body which lives a physiological life and
into a soul which stops being dependent on its body,
separates from it and begins to "soar" into different
dimensions, into different areas and levels.


Probably this separation from the body oomes with
the mood of "difference", with the mood of immobilization
and rigidity of body and with the mood of the slow
birth and growth of mystical visions.


Such an individual is a witness, an object and a subject

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This process begins often in conditions of increase in
some area of sensitivity, for example -- olfactory of smell,
of a flower&apos;s fragrance. It does not have to possess the
entire consciousness at once. The individual -- who under-
goes this process -- can stop these states and control them,
can determine the time and place of an experience, can
see and control the environment and come back to the
state of contemplation.


Sometimes -- as some mystics say -- in the beginning
of such experiences one can hear something like "ethereal
music" which cannot be described, which does not resemble
real music, is not rythmical but presents something like
a spoken process of development, that is to say, development
which progresses toward the quickening process of separation
of the soul from the body.


Sometimes these experiences look only partially similar
and sometimes they express -- after the first period of
separation -- "cosmic leap" into the "ethereal music&apos;". It
is probably a big impetus into space, a space filled with
preyerful mood, with emotional aims toward Divinity, with

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sometimes, in the process of such experience one feels
the strong gravity of bodily life; there arise inner conflicts;
and the "higher ego" returns to the body with which it has
strong feelings of connection.


Also it is possible -- during the first kind of experience
-- to transport oneself in the air, to steer oneself, to
experience spiritual joy because of independence from the
rules of gravity, from the pressure of connections with
the earth. This experiment -- say those who experience it --
has nothing in common with dreams or with "flying" during
dreams. Consciousness is more perfect, control much higher
and there is a possibility of stopping the experiment and
coming to it, at will.


It has probably happened many times that sensitive
individuals saw and were "called" by a "double" brought
on by an individual who was contemplating and experiencing
mystical states of split. It sometimes happened that the
individual who saw "double" went to the house of the owner
of this "double" and asked him what he wanted.


The contemplating individual usually knows what was
going on and tries to introduce someone to the normal
interpretation of this phenomenon.


So, there are things on this earth and in heaven "about
which even philosophers did not dream". However -- it
seems to me -- that these states are often connected with
development of psychoneurotic, and even schizophrenic
processes. Proper study of an attitude toward these matters
could perhaps throw a fundamental light on the proximity
of the positive developmental states of the above described.


So, perhaps the future belongs to the psychoneurotics
and schizophrenics?

<b>Authentism in madness</b>


I think that authentism of man exists only in
nuclei that can be developed through life&apos;s difficulties,
sufferings and breakdowns.


Now I realize that the above sentence is taken from
the automatic, superficial though organized expression of

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But something else is ascertained here. In the "abnormal"
group many symptoms such as obsessions or compulsions
contain something of authentism. They free a man from
alarming, tense aims to shatter the existing reality, to
reject the official, the rigid and dignified.


Sometimes authenism results from the need of prospection
from reaching "beyond", a need eontainig morbid tendencies
to be rid of the automatism of the instinctive structures
and functions. We could ascertain this in the case of Van
Gogh who cut off his ear. It was a protest, it was a
compulsion against automatism; it was an expression of
tension impossible to control; it was an expression of the
impossibility of finding creative expression -- that is to
say -- it was a compulsion of the "lower self" in spite
of impossibility of finding the proper self. Sometimes suicide
expresses more the global aim toward authentism than the
above mentioned kind of compulsions. Here there are
various gradation of an attempt to get out from unbearable,
impossible to control tension.

<b>On existential anxiety</b>


I am not talking here about existential fear but about
existential anxiety. Why?


Anxiety has -- among other things -- 3 important
differentiated qualities: it is a less primitive phenomena
and is higher in the scale of development; in content it is
less concrete, that is to say, more global; and inner elements
are dominant over external.


All this indicates that existential anxiety has complicated
philosophical colouring and that it expresses the connections

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What main intellectual-experiencing contents can we find
in existential anxiety? The name itself tells us that this
anxiety has strict connection with existence. This anxiety
is far away from the fear of financial difficulties, of
misery, of one&apos;s own death. So, it is not a primitive anxiety.
It is also not the anxiety of some types of existence, of
normal, of "statistical" life, for example, in the sense of
financial difficulties. Anxiety is rather an expression of
the protest against this everyday, apparent, non-essential
existence. It is an expression of a protest against "apparent"
essences.


It is not only a result of a protest against non-existence,
it is a protest against some forms of existence. It is an
expression of a protest against existence in identification
with God, against the limitation of individual and against
absorbtion of the individual by God because both are an
expression of ill-usage of truly human feelings of a man
and ill-usage of authentic understanding and experiencing
of God. It is a need of a human longing to love independently,
not under pressure. It is an anxiety not to be limited in
acquiring God&apos;s love through freedom and with keeping his
independence and freedom; love in the sense of unavoidable
individual&apos;s essence accepted by oneself autonomically and
authentically in harmony with the unchangeable qualitatively
human personality.


Existential anxiety is perhaps an apprehension of
development and perfection of such a personality which
-- from God&apos;s will and one&apos;s own good and chattels --
would be at the same time in God and beyond God and
which would break in an absolute way the fear of God
and others.


It is a protest of tragedy. It is a huge and deep
self-consciousness of the possibility of autonomy and
authentism based on a disposition of man, on "a shout
of will" and one&apos;s own dignity, and not on sufficient
experience and verification. This self-consciousness leads
to the highest tensions and inner conflicts, leads to tragedy.


Independence in a human way, love in a human way,
truth created by oneself and in harmony with God&apos;s truth

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I hope they do not take that which I have loved in
altruistic and essential truth; I hope they do not take
that which they let me acquire in struggles of the
"higher with the lower" -- some representatives of the human
race ask and fight for this.


If this is taken from man, if he is pressed down
by God&apos;s power or by nature under the mask of "higher
love of God" or by rules of involution -- the human
individual, matured in a tragic antinomy of existence and
non-existence, will choose non-existence in an imposed life
which is grasped discursively and abstractively.


Acquiring the unknown in that which is unknown but
grasped in longing and human essence and which develops
in the feeling of dignity -- is one of the fundamental
elements of existential anxiety.


"I want to be with them, with the chosen, with the
beloved, with friend like the relation of Christ with Apostles;
I want to have and keep these interests, needs and abilities
which make my essence; I do not want to forget about
my tragic way; I want to have the same of more sensitivity"
-- here is my creed, here is my lament and cry toward
higher hierarchy. Without this I prefer to die forever.


This split between the unconsciousness and needs and
longings; this tragedy of uncertainty, this fight between a
slave and a man dependent on the unknown -- is the
content of existential anxiety.

<b>Cosmic spirituality and cosmic techniques</b>


In the world of nuclear experiments, in the world of
biology and biochemistry, in the world of electronic brains
-- there arise thoughts and experiments of penetration into
new worlds. One thinks about the creation of artificial
people, about refrigeration and thawing of human tissues
and bringing to life -- the dead.


These are biological and physical experiments and besides
them, in a very poor way, there appear aims in the spiritual

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652257-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perhaps the technique through the slow but systematic
problem solving from the borderline of biology and medicine,
and the detailed techniques will indicate the even greater
possibilities for psychology, education, philosophy and spiritual
life. Perhaps they will prepare for a spiritual "leap into
the unknown", will allow the invention and creation of
forces of autonomy and authentism which are at present
too weak. Perhaps it will allow the fortification of these
efforts from the biological side; perhaps it will allow
the discovery of one&apos;s own methods of regulation of spiritual
multilevel forces which would be able to transgress the
life cycle of man, to transgress the dependence from
constitutional forces and external environment.


Perhaps we will enter the area of possibilities of enlarging
the forces of concentration, of human essence and of
"approaching" transcendence.


Frankly, I doubt it, and even I do not believe in reaching
these roads on a narrow path: scientific and technical.
In every case there must be the cooperation of transformed,
sublime and authentic spiritual forces of man, that is to say,
also "psychopathological forces".
