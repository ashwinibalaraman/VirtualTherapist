TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:
______________________________________________________________________________
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: Friday morning at around 10:30, I got an e-mail from my friend Heather Kate saying, "Hey, you're probably not interested in this, but here is this e-mail forwarded from my mother-in-law." Heather Kate's mother-in-law was the head of the high school that we went to—um—and she had gotten this e-mail from her good friend who teaches and is like the principal or something at this charter school—um—and they suddenly have a teacher position for a year that they need to fill because someone is—has to take a sudden leave of absence. So—um—this is going to seem really fast (ph) (laughs).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So I wrote back and I was like, "Yes, yes, yes," and by that afternoon I had like called and left a message with the people that Annie (sp), Heather's mother-in-law, told me to call and leave a message with. And Annie had apparently called several people and was like—and just was like, "You need to give this job to this woman."
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 0:01:26.0
CLIENT: (laughs) Which is awesome.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And she's like—I—I don't know. I have mixed feelings about her. She's been not—she and Heather got off to a—Heather got off to a rocky start. There was—the first Christmas after they were married, Diego (sp) got seated at the grown-ups table and Heather-Kate got seated at the kids table (laughs).
THERAPIST: (laughs)
CLIENT: They have that kind of a relationship. (laughs)
THERAPIST: There's some that's subtle and some that isn't. Yeah.
CLIENT: Annie's not so much into subtle. (laughs) And—but, yeah—um—so on Saturday morning, I got a phone call from this woman, who's like godmother to one of Annie's kids. And, um—but—who was like, "Yeah, the head of the upper—the assistant head and the chair of the department are both out of town with no e-mail or cell phone access until Monday. So they're going to take over, but like let me talk to you for a little bit." So she did a little bit of a phone interview.
THERAPIST: Right. 0:02:32.0
CLIENT: Like I talked to James the night before, and he was like "Never do a phone interview off the cuff. Like always say ‘Can I call you back later?'"
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And so I talked a little bit, and then I was like, "You know, now's not a good time." And it actually was in the middle of breakfast—um—and—but—so probably they're going to call me today or tomorrow. And it sounds as if this might actually happen.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Um, it—she said that Annie really raved about me. Those were her words, um—(laughs)—and that—Annie doesn't do that if there's not reason, which is true. You know, she's—she—she's (inaudible). Like, she just is.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And I need something really fast, you know? And I have been really clear, like, I am not a specialist. I'm not. But I'm a scholar.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And I have enough experience—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT:—and I have teaching experience.
THERAPIST: Yep. 0:03:35.5
CLIENT: And I know charter schools, which is very important. So I've been kind of rocketing—not rocketing quite so badly as I thought might happen, but rocketing back and forth between, "This is really, really good," and, "There's no way." (laughs) I'm like—cuz it would mean moving to Camden.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Living in a dorm—
THERAPIST: Sure, yeah.
CLIENT:—paying dorm fees, you know, commuting down here two or three times a week.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And (pause) I think—you know, I could see it being really, really good for me –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT:—as in—you know, honestly the teaching isn't—like you get really immediate feedback.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Like you know when things are working. 0:04:29.0
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And you know when things aren't. And there's always at least one class a day where things aren't going to go right.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: At least that was my experience. I don't know what it would be like in this school. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And that's really good, and I could see being part of this kind of community that strives to be very warm and intentional and working with kids all the time –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT:—like I could see it being really good, but I could also see it as being like just so draining.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So I kind of want your actual opinion, but I'm not sure I'm going to get it. (laughs). But—um—I don't know—um (pause)
THERAPIST: Um, well, I don't have one yet. 0:05:27.7
CLIENT: (laughs) Ok. Ok.
THERAPIST: Um (pause) um (pause)
CLIENT: I mean, I—I've already applied, basically.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I—I sent in my CV –
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT:—and cover letter—
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT:—and references. Um—it—it seems like the sort of thing where if I was going to get the job it was going to be because I was available right now.
THERAPIST: Yep.
CLIENT: You know? Um—they're probably going to start orientation in like a week or two.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So—um—I just—it's just really fast.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 0:06:37.4
CLIENT: Um (pause) and that was—and you know, I just—I go back and forth. Today, I'm feeling like—it's—you know, it's not that I'm trying to live up to the ideal teacher that lives in my head, like, really I'm just trying to live up to other teachers. I know a lot of teachers.
THERAPIST: Yep. (inaudible)
CLIENT: I can do that.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Um—you know, thinking about—I mean, just when thinking about interview questions and then thinking up questions that I would have for them—um—yeah, you know, I know exactly what I would need to do, I think. Or I know pretty much what I would need to do and I think I—I can do it.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Um –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And it's something that I've missed so much (ph)—and James said that—James really wants me to do it. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: He's like trying so hard not to push. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (laughs) 0:07:55.7
CLIENT: But he says that—you know, he really likes when I talk about teaching or when like a teaching opportunity comes up because I just like light up and I just get so excited about it. And it's true.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So you know—yeah. You know—and—I've seen the really good parts and the really bad parts of charter schools.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And, you know, I've never been some place that's—I—I've never been in some place that's like quite on the tier of Camden –
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT:—but I feel like it's kind of like with colleges. Everything else is—is pretty much just trying to be the same that or the same thing as –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT:—Camden itself is just trying to be Camden.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: (laughs) You know, there's a lot of really, really valuable stuff that they do and a lot of stuff typically that's bullshit.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And you just have to pull through it.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) They're tuition, room and board, is $50,000 a year. 0:09:05.2
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: (laughs) And on the website, I think it was the interview with the head master, he was like, "I'm so proud that, you know, I feel like we're—we're really moving away from the whole image of a prep school, and our—our rate of students who receive financial aid is up to 40 percent." (laughs) And I'm like, "You've got to be fucking kidding me." (laughs)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Right.
CLIENT: You have a $300,000,000 endowment, and you're only giving financial aid to 40 percent of your students?
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Give me a break. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But—but that is actually a role I'm really comfortable with—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT:—of, you know, being inside something that I'm slightly cynical about.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Maybe that's bad? (pause) Certainly it's helped me deal with the university (ph). (laughs)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (laughs) Yeah, that too. (pause) So I think at this moment I guess I feel a little like you're looking for my—um (pause) this is going to sound more patronizing than I mean it to, but like a screw hole (ph) or kind of—permission, but like encouragement that this is a good thing? 0:10:41.1
CLIENT: Um, yes. I mean (pause) rationally, I just want to know if you have any immediate alarm bells that say, "No, she's really not ready for this, this is a terrible idea." I want to know about them. Um—below that, obviously, I just want you to tell me I should go for it.
THERAPIST: (laughs) What—um—while we're at it, what alarm bells or flags are likely to be going off for me about this? I bet you could tell me what they are.
CLIENT: Um—that's it's going to be a fuck ton of work. I'm going to be working all the time.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Because I don't very—I don't know the subject material that well. (laughs)
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: You know? And I'm relying on my ability to stay two steps ahead of the kids, which—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT:—I basically always can.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And on the fact that it is really easy. Um—yeah, that it's going to be a lot of work. That it's going to be a completely different social setting and a life setting, that I'm not going to have as much privacy as I would like. Um—it—you know, it—when I'm not—that I'm just stable enough. Um—um—you know, I can't—I can't feel confident any more that I won't just stop being able to function abruptly.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 0:12:50.9
CLIENT: And that scares me.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And uh—not—I take my responsibility to my students really very seriously, you know?
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I—I don't want to do that if that means that—you know, I don't want to let them down.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Because (inaudible—whispers) children.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, those are the ones that I am worried about. Um—I—you know, I also want to ask you because things that—because things that I worry about are not all the things that there are to worry about. (laughs) Or—or—not—there's—I'm still worried (ph) there's a Venn diagram between –
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT:—the things that are actually concerning and the things that I'm concerned about. 0:14:00.0
THERAPIST: Right. Right.
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: Right. Right. (pause) It does sound like—um—though you'd be worried about some things, in a lot of ways you feel, I think, like it was a huge relief to do this.
CLIENT: In some ways, yeah. I mean (pause) it (laughs)—that I would have a purpose.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: After the purpose? (laughs) It would feed me. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I mean, the—yeah, room and board is quite the perk. You know, I would have a salary and health insurance. Don't need health insurance again, but whatever. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Right. Presumably it would get easier, but (inaudible) health insurance, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, I—I have—I haven't really thought about it until this moment in this way, but I would be in a role that I know—where I know what's expected of me, to some degree. And I have done that before. You know, it would be something that I didn't feel like I was doomed from the beginning, which—you know, I feel that way about school now. It's just—about the scholarship, I just—to feel doomed. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Huh. Huh.
CLIENT: You know, sometimes—some days, I really get excited about it still, but I just feel like (pause) you know, it's probably the reason to take a leave of absence (ph) when I—I just felt like I couldn't—I couldn't make it. (pause) Um—their religion teacher is—has his—got his Ph.D. from—oh, fuck—I think ... But some place good.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 0:17:51.9
CLIENT: [inaudible].
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know, had a couple of books.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It's a chair position, the SPL (ph). It's like—he's a (inaudible) scholar.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: That's impressive. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. You can (inaudible) school. 0:18:09.8
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. And it makes—the head of—my boss at—at St. Margaet's, you know, I think really wanted St. Margaret's to be that model –
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT:—of the secondary school where the faculty like actually had time to pursue charter research. Um—but, yeah, St.—St. Margaret's doesn't have the resources.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And the—
THERAPIST: Yeah, I've heard that—
CLIENT:—the teachers don't have the time.
THERAPIST: Right. I've heard that about other, like, prep schools around here, that they—it sometimes works out well for the Ph.D. as well, who are like, "I don't want to deal with the—sort of big time deals and the academic stuff."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like, "I'm really teaching high school." That's kind of—it's like a cool kind of effort. Could you really not give me time to do my research, and come to work with the kids, and really focus on teaching the right way.
CLIENT: Yeah, that was kind of my vision when I started grad school.
THERAPIST: Yeah. 0:19:06.1
CLIENT: Although, again, you know, I'm so conflicted about the utility and principles of that—I—I don't—you know—I don't know. I just—because it's just—
THERAPIST: Because you're mostly educating rich kids?
CLIENT: No, not necessarily, but partly.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know, there's a really good thing about an insular community, and there's really good—bad things about it.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And I think—you know, as—the—the people at St. Margaret's, you know, failed me in some serious ways in terms of, like, standing in for parents and didn't (inaudible) at times. And—but at the same time, it was still a much better environment than I had at home, so—and even that was really good. I don't know. I just (pause) I—I just—I—it's just so pretentious. It's so fucking pretentious. Like I feel there's just this assumption that you can't get a good education in a public school. And I just had this assumption as a—because I had always been in private schools. 0:20:40.5
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Until I got to college, and the two smartest people that I was around were Franco and James, both of whom were publicly educated and both of whom had much better educations than I did.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Well, not James. You know—and—and both of them were lucky in where they were.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But like—you know. And—and it's like—it's like this—this club. Like, if I get hired, it's going to be because I went to an charter school, and like I know boarding school.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And I feel like that just limits the talent they need so much that they want people that they know and understand.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. I see that's –
CLIENT: But I would still take that job. (laughs)
THERAPIST: I understand. It's like code or sort of (inaudible) having a certain kind of background.
CLIENT: Something like that, yeah. Yeah, you know and then—and maybe it's just—I just have a chip on my shoulder from like my entire life I've been surrounded by people who had so much more money than I did. (laughs) 021:50.8
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know, I had a $40 a month allowance when I was at St. Margaret's. Like I—I could basically buy shampoo. Like I never could go out to eat, I never could go see movies. I just couldn't do it. Um—and—you know, I've always been around people with like fucking preposterous amounts of money.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So it's like—you know? (pause) I don't always handle it as maturely as I would like to. (laughs) (pause) At the same time, I did deliberately choose—I mean, not –before this, but like I chose a career path that I knew was going to keep me poor for the rest of my life.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 0:22:44.7
CLIENT: Like I said, "Yeah, I'll keep doing this. This is fine." So—(pause)
THERAPIST: Have you kind of already decided?
CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, I just—but I just don't—I think that there's a—a not trivial chance that I'll really regret the decision.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 0:23:56.8
CLIENT: Yeah. So it's like—but I think if I—if I didn't pursue it, I would regret it so much more.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I just find uncertainty really scary.
THERAPIST: Feeling uncertain for whether you'll regret it?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Why do you mention you will or might?
CLIENT: Because I'm not well, you know? I'm not stable. I'm just not. And I really want to be. Um—but I—you know, the stakes are so much higher here than, you know, temping for a year.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 0:25:00.0
CLIENT: Um—(inaudible—whispers)
THERAPIST: You mean, with the kids?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause) You know and—thinking of Annie.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It's less—you know, I have no idea why she's recommending me so highly. Like I've never worked for her. She hired me—she taught me—or she was the head when I was at school.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And then she hired me, but she had—was leaving. Like, she hired—that was one of the last things she did. And then when I was working at St. Margaret's there was a new head. (pause) And—and so—so it's easier because I don't love her in the way that I love the other mentor—um—but at the same time, like, I don't want to let her down. And it's not like English where if you don't learn anything in British Literature, you can catch up next year. You know?
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I mean, I know this because I had a group of 10th graders who hadn't learned shit in 9th grade. (laughs) That teacher had been new the previous year –
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT:—and they let her go after –
THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, it's not like math. 0:26:45.6
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Where if you don't do Algebra 1 it's hard to do Algebra 2.
CLIENT: Exactly. And I know that because I had an 8th grade Latin teacher who didn't teach us anything, and I started in Latin 2 Honors in high school and had to drop back to Latin 1 and do it all over again.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So I, you know, lost—well, I lost reading Cicero, so I didn't lose very much. (laughs) You know?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (laughs) I shouldn't say that. (laughs)
THERAPIST: (laughs) You're not at the interview yet.
CLIENT: I know. (laughs) I just have to, like, start working on my filter.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I don't know why I—I'm surprised this is so scary. Everything is scary, like, for me, right now. Everything scares me. Um—but this is scary in a new way.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Well (pause) uh—there's one—another reason I think it may be scary—uh (pause) I have not heard you since you, like, started talking about this a few minutes ago or however many minutes ago it was—um—really express much worry at all about yourself. Like, you're worried about not doing well enough or being stable enough and letting the kids down, or you letting the school down, or maybe letting Annie down, or burning a bridge there, or something like that. But you haven't said anything about simply what it would be like for you if it was too much. 0:29:35.0
CLIENT: I'm trying not to think about that. Um, but yeah.
THERAPIST: I—I'm sort of suspecting of—maybe—especially when you say that, I have it wrong—that you were leaving it somewhat to me to look out for you. I mean, by sort of asking for my take, knowing it's harder for you to think about yourself that way. I think you –
CLIENT: Maybe –
THERAPIST:—might be horrified, feel like you're a laughing matter to me, but that's not how I would see it.
CLIENT: I mean –
THERAPIST: Am I being clear?
CLIENT: You know, I think so.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um—I think that's very possible, as I have—have been thinking about it. It's more like I know exactly what it will be like if it's too hard for me. I know exactly what it will feel like. Um—you know, it will be right back in hell all the time, and it's much easier, I think, for me to think about the con—the consequences of that for other people than to think about being there. Um—that—you know, I mean, at this point, we both know what it looks like for me when it's like that. 0:31:26.0
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Um (pause) but I don't know—I don't know how to avoid it or whether—you know, I think (pause)—I don't know. I—you know, I—I –
THERAPIST: It's just very frightening to think about –
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST:—what it would be like to be having the sort of hard time, I guess, that you have had in the last few months or close to a year—a year?
CLIENT: The kind of hard time that I haven't had or that I have had?
THERAPIST: You have been having.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Combined with—with living in a dorm, having full-time job responsibilities, or dorm responsibilities, people around you all the time?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I imagine that's (pause) very intimidating.
CLIENT: You know, it's really—it's like if I start looking at that, I can't look away, so –
THERAPIST: Do you?
CLIENT: If I start thinking about what it would be like for me to be having that hard of a time, I can't—I can't think—like I can't think at all. I—I can't think about anything other than being so terrified of that and how horrible that is. And I can't make decisions based on that kind of—because that (pause) it's probably going to happen no matter what I do, at some point any way –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT:—for some of the time, and I have just move forward, I can't—I can't let that—you know, if I think about that, that's—that's when I just stay in bed and don't eat and don't—I lack function. I don't do anything.
THERAPIST: I see. 0:34:41.3
CLIENT: And I've done a lot of that this year and I'm broke (laughs), so (pause) you know?
THERAPIST: So it's debilitating to think about –
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST:—that?
CLIENT: I think you were right, you know, (laughs) that I do—I do, you know, keep relying on you to—to look out for me in that way. Do you see that as a problem? (laughs) I mean, that's—that's—not a real question.
THERAPIST: Oh, ok. I—I think you—no, no, my point was more like (pause) um—I guess I can put it like this: that what you were just describing and how scary it would be was one of the first things I had thought of when you first started talking about the job, along with the other things you were saying.
CLIENT: Uh-huh. 0:36:20.8
THERAPIST: And it became conspicuous to me that you had—that you were talking about it. And that combined with your interest in my opinion made me think you were kind of sort of leaving that for me to think about because it—it became clear it was so overwhelming for you to think about. And so, you ask me if that's a problem? Yeah, I mean it's (pause) it's a way you're trying to deal with something that's quite overwhelming, I think, to think about. But is also—you know, it's germane.
CLIENT: It's the only thing that's germane in some ways. (laughs)
THERAPIST: No, I think the rest of it is, too. I mean, at least to my mind the other side of this is that, I think, for better and for worse, you're probably (pause) really excited about the way this job could kind of pull you out of yourself. Not—that—that sounds more negative than what I really had in mind like –
CLIENT: I know what you had in mind, though.
THERAPIST:—with—you know, with being part of a community, having kids to focus on, responsibilities and things to take care of, stuff that matters. Like, that's so much—easier or it feels so much better to you, I think—um—you know, in a way because of the good, constructive work, because you would matter to yourself (ph), and in a way because it doesn't give you nearly as much room to focus on yourself. I think –
CLIENT: I'm so (inaudible—whispers). (laughs)
THERAPIST: (laughs) Ok. And I—I imagine that your hope is that (pause) it would like help you feel better to do this job.
CLIENT: That's my hope. 0:39:04.5
THERAPIST: And (pause) so I—I guess I think you were sort of taking that side of it and you—me the other side of it, a little bit. Like, you were focused on the hope and the excitement that would go along with, you know, sort of the whole package of things involved with the job. Like, focusing on the kids, focusing on teaching, having the much more structured life, you know, having like a security set-up, like—and –
CLIENT: I hope that and I also just want to get that—I'm in a cycle of being more excited about it than I am afraid of it.
THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, and you –
CLIENT: Like we were talking yesterday.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I might have focused on the –
THERAPIST: The other side? Yeah.
CLIENT: Maybe? I don't know.
THERAPIST: Maybe. (pause) I guess—uh—I'm imagining that we're kind of on the same page about it—all important, like—well, the—like, your excitement about it and (inaudible) the way that it's good, you know, that you're doing things for kids and helping them, and it's satisfying, and also a way to not be with yourself, as much as what's going on with you. And the other side, that—uh—I imagine it is pretty—it is a terrifying and debilitating prospect to think about what you go through, periods of days or weeks where you're having really—or months, where you're having a really hard time. When you're there with all your responsibilities and all of—you know, and relatively little space for yourself—time for yourself.
CLIENT: Uh-huh. 0:41:20.0
THERAPIST: Um (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I don't have an opinion at this moment about whether you should do it or not, you know. I actually—I would—again, I probably would say so—I mean, if –
CLIENT: I—so when I –
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: When I said—you know, I want your opinion.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I guess what I really meant is that I guess I have a responsibility not to take the job if I can't do it.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And so that if I was missing something huge—
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT:—to say—it's not just that this is a calculated risk. This is, you know, probably destined for failure.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And you could see that, you know—
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT:—I want you to tell me that.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Whereas –
THERAPIST: Yeah—(inaudible) kind of what I was going to say is I think most important is you sort of see the whole picture as best you can. And yeah, it seemed to me there was this one part of it that you don't know why you would think about it today, in this hour, although it was—I wasn't all convinced you hadn't thought about it before. I mean, you said it was sort of (inaudible) the job. But (pause) yeah, I'm not seeing anything besides what I've said that you're not thinking about.
CLIENT: Ok. 0:42:57.3
THERAPIST: Um –
CLIENT: That's good to know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, I think—um—I think it could be pretty tough if you have a bad stretch, which what's nice about it is a lot of what you've been having—and you, you know, had teaching responsibilities for a lot of the day and dorm responsibilities at night and—
CLIENT: To look at the—the woman I talked to –
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT:—described the schedule for me. It sounds as though it's a very long day, but there's a lot of flexibility and down time in it.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So the class periods run—the classes—the classes meet—you meet six days a week, but each class only meets four times a week for 45 minutes at a time.
THERAPIST: I see. 0:43:50.7
CLIENT: But classes run like 8:45 to 3:10.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I don't know what they do with the rest of that time.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But it's not like packaged –
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT:—you know—
THERAPIST: Yeah. That's kind of what my schedule's like (ph).
CLIENT: Fair enough. (laughs) Yeah. And so—and that seems like that could work for me.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that sounds great. I think it's going to be a hard time for you know—you have to—you know, when you have to teach in the afternoon, you'll have to teach in the afternoon. Or if it's –
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST:—you know, 10:00 at night and you're having a rough time and a student comes and knocks on your door –
CLIENT: Still have to (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Right. That said, you know, I would take your enthusiasm for this and your history with—interest in teaching, and it's plausible to me that you'll feel better when you're there, you know, like—for various reasons.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So you know, if—if I—if I had some reason to think you would be feeling all year like you've been feeling this last year, I would be really—then I would say, like, "Wait a minute, I really need to think about this."
CLIENT: Ok. 0:44:52.6
THERAPIST: Because I think if you were feeling—over a year, teaching like that, like you've been feeling over the last year, I don't think it would work.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But at least to me it seems plausible that you will feel better for the kind of environment and type of work you would be doing.
CLIENT: Ok.
THERAPIST: You know, that's a –
CLIENT: Sometimes I think you're thinking about the same thing –
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT:—that I am. It's a risk.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But you (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I can do it (ph).
THERAPIST: You've got it for now.
CLIENT: Ok.
THERAPIST: We can talk more about it Wednesday.
CLIENT: Um, in terms of meeting four times a week –
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT:—can we do that –
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT:—for now?
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Ok.
THERAPIST: I'll e-mail you the schedule.
