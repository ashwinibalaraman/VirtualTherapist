In telling the story of our trip to the Philippines and landings
at Lingayen Gulf on Luzon I am handicapped somewhat by
an organic amnesia. This memory gap begins with the last
months of our service in New Guinea and ends early in 1946.
The straightforward story will be told from the "islets of memory"
which are so characteristic of this organic amnesia. Some
psychiatrists call this a "fragmentary memory." This difficulty
in recollection makes writing arduous; later in this account I
will attempt to give an accurate description of this amnesic fog.
This portion is a nail-biting attempt to write a story with continuity.
My present retention is excellent, but it is hard cracking
open the recollections of those fourteen months.


Our field hospital embarked for the Philippines on 6 January
1945. We loaded our personal equipment into amphibious
ducks and took the rough ride out into Maffin Bay to board the
ship. We were a sorry-looking group of men, contrasted with
the spic-and-span sailors aboard. Everything we possessed containing
metal was rusted. The metal, surrounding eyelets of our
shoes, was rusted. The bucklets of our belts and our steel helmets
were rustier, even though they had been used constantly. Hinges
and locks of foot lockers were covered with corrosion. An inspection
would have been embarrasing.


There were many ships in the convoy; it was made up by
troops from New Guinea and from Manus Island of the Admiralties.
Units of the First Cavalry Division were aboard some
of the ships. The vessels were crowded with soldiers; we opened

Four diversions occupied us during the three-week trip —
poker, eating, gazing at the many Philippine Islands and working
in the sick bay. Sickcall was conducted daily topsides at
an improvised infirmary. Most of the soldiers had "jungle rot"
and we did our duty. We painted their skin. With the knowledge
that we must use a colored solution we tried blue, pink,
red, orange solutions. None did any harm; few did any good.
The soldiers were at least half satisfied if we daubed a bright-colored
medicine on them. We knew that a change of climate
would cure them and within the year many would be in the
United States.


The hills of Mindanao provided our first glimpse of the
Philippine Islands. The great convoy plowed through the tranquil
Pacific along Mindanao's eastern shore and we soon saw
the coasts of Dinagat and Leyte while going through the Surigao
Strait. Before we emerged into the Sulu Sea we gazed for
hours at the islands of Bohol, Cebu and Negros. They differed
little in their topography. Passing through Mindoro Strait we
had our first glimpse at "battle wagons." These were the first
battleships we had seen in the Pacific. We reasoned that our
fliers had air supremacy if these big boys could herd into those
waters.


The long trip was no pleasure cruise. It was a vessel of about
ten thousand tons and the heat below deck seemed unbearable.
At night we played cards in a small messroom about two decks
down. We stripped to our waists and had fans in the room. It
was nevertheless uncomfortable; the room temperature was
above ninety degrees. We perspired so much that we carried
bath towels to use periodically.


While we were threading our way between the many Philippine
Islands I began having headaches and could not determine
their cause. I reasoned that it was not due to the excessive heat,
as drinking water and taking salt tablets offered no relief. I was
more troubled when I found myself becoming irritable. Poker

The long, weary trip finally ended and we arrived at Lingayen
Gulf. This gulf is on the northwest shore of Luzon. The
entire bay and beach were crowded with vessels of all descriptions.
It was a busy war spot; invasion of Luzon was proceeding
at a feverish pace and debarking units were fanning out to
break the Japanese grip on this island. The "Pearl of the
Orient" would soon be freed!


Late in the dusk of 25 January 1945 we went ashore and
sought a spot to bivouac during the night. We were near the
city of Dagupan. Finally we found a less crowded spot on the
beach and set up our pup tents. We sat down to K rations
around a small fire. Then we laid our ponchos on the sand
inside the pup tents, inflated the small flotation bladders to be
used as pillows, pulled some blankets over us and went to sleep.
During the night it rained hard and there was a strong windstorm.
I awakened with a headache and was nauseated. Crawling
outside the tent I found my entrenching tool and dug a
hole in the sand. Vomiting into it does not warrant description.
Later during the night I became nauseated and dug another
hole. The headache and dizziness seemed to improve, and I
crawled into the tent to sleep out this first night on Philippine
soil. On awakening the next morning I laughingly told Eddy
Haskett that I'd probably have to take more calomel!


I fussed around for a day, half confused and worried, while
the 37th Field Hospital moved inland from the beach. Two days
after landing the commanding officer asked me to go to the
beach to supervise a detail of men in unloading our supplies.
I have little recollection of what we did; we remained there for
about ten hours in the hot sun. That night I returned to our
area fatigued and dizzy. I felt that even a night's rest wouldn't
make me feel better. Somehow <i>I</i> was badly shaken and had a

In those succeeding three days I badly needed my friends
in the 37th Field Hospital. They did not return in those hectic
first three days of February. For some reason I was not evacuated;
every hour I became more disoriented. It became apparently
impossible to remain quiet and equally impossible for
the medical attendants to keep me in bed. Four corpsmen were
unable to handle the situation.


When it became obvious that better hospitalization was needed
in a fixed hospital I was evacuated by air to the 360th Station
Hospital. I arrived there on a litter and was left among a
group of other casualties. I was comatose and had a temperature
of 103.6°. There was some type of "miliary rash" on my
body. There was some weakness of my left arm, presumably from
pressure on the sides of the litter. One of the medical officers
later told me I was moribund; at any rate, shortly thereafter I
developed a pulmonary edema due to a circulatory collapse. It
was at this stage that the news went through channels resulting
in the wire received by Mrs. Leach shown in the appendix. Sum
and substance of the situation was that I "wasn't at all well."


A day later, when the coma lessened, I looked about me and
discovered that many of the Americans who had been imprisoned
by the Japs at Baguio, the summer capital of Luzon,
were on cots near me. I shall never forget the emaciated colonel
who was on my left. He was skin and bones! The colonel was
still smoking his ancient corncob pipe and had a bag of weeds
which he had smoked at Baguio. Some of the Americans had

Three days later, quite bewildered, disgruntled over a furred
tongue and dismayed by weakness and tingling of my left arm,
I surveyed the ward and bemoaned my fate. The doctor from
the corn-hog belt was now more than satisfied with field duty!
Those stringy pectoral muscles had done their share of straining
during the delirious period and had wearily shivered into fatigue.
The bed was hard. I gazed in interest at some small petechiae
scattered over my body. I was a casualty!


Within a week I graduated from bed rest and took my place
in the mess lines at the outdoor kitchen. Somewhere I bought
some wooden claques and wandered out to the shower along the
shade of the buildings and stood in the cool water. Hours were
spent listening to stories of Jap atrocities told by liberated prisoners
from Cabanatuan. Soon I thought that only a period of
rest would be needed and I could return to duty. So I found
some Red Cross stationery and wrote a letter to Marion.


Attempting to review the illness on February 3rd, I told
Marion in this letter:


"I was a little confused so I asked Major Buck and Bob to
take me to a hospital. I am unable to make a diagnosis; all that
I know was that I vomited until everything was out and now
I feel much better. I most certainly hope that everything
straightens out directly so I can go back to work."


This letter was written at the same time that I was removed
from the seriously ill list (as shown in the appendix).


Evacuation by air to a general hospital at Leyte was the next
step; the expected improvement did not occur. After mid-February
another long air hop was taken, and I found myself in a
dismal general hospital on Biak of the Shouten Islands. On
this lengthy jaunt we made a brief stopover at Peleliu of the
Palau Islands. I had returned to the desperate beat off the coast
of New Guinea!


Hospitalization at Biak was bleak; <i>I</i> was among a large group

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The barracks were constantly locked and our activities were
supervised by corpsmen. We wore those half-on, half-off homemade
Red Cross slippers when in the barracks. Our field shoes
were parked in racks outside the barracks, as the attendants
feared we'd strike one another with the shoes. Our belts were
denied to us, as the commanding officers must have thought
we'd hang ourselves. So most of the time our trousers were half
on, half off. This was merely an initiation into endless regulations
which were to follow in the succeeding long months.
When we shaved at this hospital a corpsman stood alongside
to watch us. Lest we slit our throats! How little those men knew
how traumatizing that air of suspicion was to the very sensitive
minds of these mentally ill soldiers! I attempted immediately to
gulp the whole situation into complete, placid understanding so
that air of suspicion, those locks, those fences and the innumerable
regulations would not tumble me into a worse mental
state. We were not even permitted to use knives at our meals;
our only utensil at the table was a tablespoon. Later in this
book I will attempt to point out how this injures the malleable
mind of the sick person.


In this wretched hospital and among those bewildered soldiers
I attempted to find my bearings. I concluded that I must
have had a heat exhaustion or some tropical disease, probably
typhus fever. I was pretty weak and wobbly and the slightest

Such was my farewell to foreign duty. It is merely sketched
into this prison background. Puzzled and tired, at times unshaven
and disheveled, I awaited return to the United States.
Waiting with me at this large hospital were over a hundred soldiers,
who, lacking a medical background, were haunted by
countless fears. Volumes could be written abount this haunting,
wretched, barefoot period, the endless days under the hot sun,
the long treks over the coral to the hell-on-earth latrine and the
miserable rations gobbled with a tablespoon! One day I saw
a nurse who was months pregnant, and two attendants were
attempting to take her for a walk. I talked with her; and she
was frantic and hysterical and could hardly be restrained. And
she questioned me, "Where is that Navy Lieutenant, J. G. ——-?
I must get in touch with him! I must, I must! Oh, Doctor Leach,
help me!" I have never seen her since. I wonder if she yet lives.


The dismal days and weeks finally came to a merciful end.
The great, graceful navy hospital ship the <i>S.S. Comfort</i>, white
as a newly laundered sheet, with huge red crosses on her gleaming
sides, hove into sight one blessed day in March. Comforted
and cared for by its sparklingly efficient navy nurses, the doctor
