SOME psychologists hold that there is no such thing as coincidence.
I am not so sure. If I had not been sent on the
errand to 33 West 42nd Street, I might never have seen a
door marked "Broadcast Central."


The word broadcast intrigued me. At the time everybody
was talking about crystal set radios; a cat's whisker tuned in
music and talk. Back with the Burritts now, I spent a lot of
time around the Y.M.C.A. Someone was always saying, "I
hear those guys that speak over this dingus get paid cash
money." That was the cue for everyone to laugh and say,
"Why?"


So out of curiosity I opened the door marked "Broadcast
Central." There was one small room and a telephone operator
with her switchboard. "Is this a broadcasting station?" I
asked; it didn't look like much of anything.


"Yes, it is," she said, very pertlike.


"What're the chances of getting to be an announcer?" I
said, to keep the thing going; she was kind of pretty.


"Oh, about one in a thousand," she said crisply. Into the
telephone she said, "What number are you calling?" I closed
the door and went on about my business, but the place stuck
in my mind.


At the Burritts' I was able to indulge my mechanical bent in
a small way. Merton and I slept in an airy room on the third
floor. On cold mornings both of us had an aversion to getting

[p. <i>41</i>]

In between such activities I would check the want ads. I
knew I hadn't found my right place yet. One morning at
breakfast as I was reading the ads, everything stopped short
for me as I read:


Wanted: Announcer for Metropolitan radio station. Must
be college graduate and have knowledge music terminology.
Apply Broadcast Central, 33 West 42nd Street,
New York City.


The coffee grew cold while I wrote an answer to the ad.
Days passed, weeks. I had given up hope when one day a post
card came. It read, "Please come to 33 West 42nd Street for
audition."


The telephone operator gave me the mere flicker of recognition.
"Remember?" I said. "You said one chance in a thousand.
Well, cross your fingers for me."


Actually the chances were one in seventy-four; there were
seventy-three applicants besides me. I never knew how many
of the others went through the full audition, but mine consisted
of reading something out of a newspaper, a few prepared
announcements, each in a different vein, a foreign news
dispatch stuffed with foreign names like dates in a pudding,
and finally an ad lib period when I was asked to describe the
studio where I was auditioning. Out of the tail of my eye I
noticed several men, hovering in the glass-enclosed control
room over a gadget of some sort. Later I learned that it was
an oscillograph, a device that showed actual voice vibrations
in revolving mirrors. This device was my unknown friend!
The radio people were after a well-modulated voicein radio
broadcasting the peaks and valleys were the dangerous things

[p. <i>42</i>]

In the resulting interview the first question was ticklish;
"Are you a college graduate?"


"Well almost," I said; "I've had two years at Syracuse."


"Do you have a knowledge of music terminology?"


A bit bolder now I showed off the side of my personality
that was both to gain me immense popularity in record time
and to cause me no end of trouble. Brashly I looked Mr.
Popenoe, the manager, in the eye and said, "I haven't even
the slightest idea what it means<i>have you</i>?" There was an
instant of stunned silence during which he looked from me
to Keith McLeod, who had written the ad in the <i>Times</i>
, and
back at me. Perhaps if I had realized that McLeod was also
the station musical director, I might have been a bit more
discreet.


With a look of surprise Mr. Popenoe said, "Keith, just what
<i>do</i> you mean by music terminology?"


McLeod picked up a copy of the <i>Musical Courier</i> from the
desk. He flipped over to the back cover, which carried a listing
of twenty or thirty foreign composers. "Knowledge of
music terminology involves the ability to talk easily and accurately
about music and to pronounce such names as these
correctly." I ran my eye down the list. Peter Ilyitch Tchaikovsky,
Sergei Vassilievitch Rachmaninoff, Jean Sibelius, Igor F.
Stravinsky, Jascha Heifetz. "I can learn things like this in
five minutes," I said, not handicapped by modesty. Mr. Popenoe
looked amused and slightly impressed. He glanced at his
watch, "You've got <i>just</i> five minutes," he said and left.


In those five minutes I inveigled Keith McLeod into reading
those names over and over to me while I made mental
notes, also sneaking a couple of penciled notations on a scrap
of paper.


"Now then," said Mr. Popenoe, "read 'em." His expression
said that it would not surprise him in the least if I ran out
the open door, <i>Musical Courier</i> and all. Luck was with me.
I sped through the list exactly as though I knew what I was

[p. <i>43</i>]

My brother Melvin was living in a rooming house in the
eighties. I was so excited at having a chance in this new and
mysterious world of radio that I tore up there to tell him
about it. I spun on so long that all of a sudden I noticed I
had exactly ten minutes to get back to the studio. I did my
best, but when I got to 33 West 42nd Street, white with fear
and out of breath, the Dow Jones report for that day had
come and gone.


But right there I was to benefit by the first of many good
turns in the radio business. Tommy Cowan, the station chief
announcer, had called Mr. Popenoe when he found I wasn't
on deck, and told him that I was a little bit nervous so he
was going to hold me for a different show a little later. I
nearly passed out with relief. He saved my job, but more
than that, he gave me a better chance; instead of having to
make my first impression with dry Wall Street statistics, he
had me introduce a pianist, name of Joel Coffey, calling for
the exercise of a little bit of personality along with the required
modulation.


It went off all right, but the next day I could hardly believe
my eyes when I discovered that it had drawn a nice
little squib in the one radio column in town, in the <i>Herald
Tribune</i>, called "Pioneer." Stuart Hawkins wrote: "Who is
this new AON? He speaks with perfect enunciation and exceptional
modulation."


If you can imagine a day when radio announcers did not
use any names, this was it. In 1924 WJZ was following the
custom of radio operators on ships at sea, who used only initials
for ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore messages. It was the
replacing of the spark gap with the tube that made possible
the broadcasting of music and voice in place of dots and
dashes, transforming radio into a medium for entertainment.
The first engineers and operators for broadcasting entertainment

[p. <i>44</i>]

The letters assigned to our announcers designated location,
affiliation, and identity; for example, Tommy Cowan was
ACN (A, announcer; C, Cowan; N, New York). For me N
couldn't be repeated; E and B sounded too much like C; so
I chose O, becoming AON.


The announcer's job was not only to introduce programs
but to line up talent and create programs. Talent, not being
paid, had to be rounded up among friends or even passers-by.
Luckily entertainers were around who had been on the air
or were known to be willing, even eager, to be. We would
write or telephone them, inviting them to be in the studio
on a given day. In one of the two studios one announcer
would be on the air with a program, while in the other studio
another announcer would be getting a pianist and singer together,
maybe a violinist, too, whipping together a little program
that would follow as soon as the other was finished. As
friends were our chief reservoir of talent, the atmosphere of
the programs was informal and happy. Our position as announcers
was quite formal, however. Our hours were like the
hours of hotel clerks; one long, one short day. In the morning
and afternoon we wore regular street clothes, but in the evening
it was the tuxedo and the elegant air.


Broadcast Central's two stations were WJZ and WJY: in
the trade they were called the twin stations, because of the
two antennas on top of 33 West 42nd Street. The so-called
studios, draped in monk's cloth for acoustical reasons, were
actually just office space adapted for this new and puzzling
use. There were windows, but they were kept shut and sealed
off with heavy hangings. Rubber snubbing made the doors
noiseless and soundproof.


Each day was a separate safari to an adventurous unknown,
thrilling little episodes with new people, uncovering the best
of existing entertainment, welding together the components
in a way to please hoped-for listeners. If we found favor with
listeners, we would stay on the air; if we didn't, we'd be
through in short order. It is all very well to say that progress
cannot be stopped; be that as it may, merely keeping up with

[p. <i>45</i>]

The crystal, or cat's whisker, set was followed by wonderful
heterodyne, and superheterodyne, hookups that used
many tubes with batteries and earphones or a speaker. Stores
all over New York sold radio parts, and magazines devoted
to mechanics were filled with articles describing how to build
your own set, using either a coil, one tube or two, or the
heterodyne and other circuits that inventors were pouring
into the market.


Once the set was constructed, it was equipped with batteries.
Experience showed the majority of sets to be heavy, awkward,
often very difficult to tune. As many as six different knobs
might have to be accurately tuned to obtain clear reception.
Earphones restricted enjoyment of the instrument by limiting
the number of listeners. Amplifying horns appeared, rendering
earphones old-fashioned if not downright obsolete.
Now the whole family could sit around comfortably and
enjoy programs. Inventors worked at top speed to render sets
without batteries operable, and on house electric current.


Management, program directors, announcers, and operators
were working at top speed, too, to develop and try out
new entertainment ideas. Broadcast Central stumbled on a
Long Island woman who had an intriguing way of explaining
household duties to women, particularly the preparation of
food. If radio in the home were ever to develop wide popularity,
it must appeal to women, who had to spend the most
time in the home. It was decided to bring a Mrs. Heath every
morning to women in their homes; the first Woman's Hour
on radio was born, and Mrs. Heath rocketed as a radio personality.


This program became a stage for me, too. Mr. Popenoe

[p. <i>46</i>]

It developed that a large proportion of Mrs. Heath's mail
came addressed to her announcer; every day made it only
clearer to management that a station announcer was no ornament
or luxury but a real necessity.


This did not make the operators happy, because operators
were proud, too. Operators and announcers became natural
enemies, each convinced of top importance, each willing to
do battle to hold the advantage. It took some time for each
to settle down to the fact that one was helpless without the
other; but finally a truce was made. It didn't preclude announcers
having to help lug equipment to remote broadcast
points, and standing taxi fares to keep the operators in a good
mood so they wouldn't mess up our modulations or otherwise
meddle with our efforts to be good on the air.


"Remotes" developed when engineers worked out the idea
that American Telephone or Western Union wires could be
used to bring programs to the transmitter from a given

[p. <i>47</i>]

The moment we had our new scope we began casting about
for likely entertainment value of more complex type. Logical
"remotes" were the metropolitan hotels; luncheon music
from the Plaza or Waldorf, at Thirty-fourth Street and Fifth
Avenue; <i>th dansant</i> music from the Astor, on Times Square;
dinner music from the Pennsylvania, only five years old in
1924 and, with two thousand rooms, the largest hotel in the
whole world. There was dance music available for broadcast
every night from the grills of famous hotels or supper clubs
and night clubs (and, during Prohibition, speak-easies!), but
now that the technique of "remote control" was developing,
many other kinds of programs were possible. For instance,
Major J. Andrew WhiteI had heard him on the cat's
whisker at the "Y" long before I answered the ad in the
<i>Times</i>broadcast a prize fight, the very first prize fight ever
to be heard by radio.


To tell the truth the Major, quite a character, became
something of a model for me. In his manner and habits he
was a gentleman, definitely the man-about-town playboy.


When I was first hired, Major White wasn't a regular member
of the Broadcast Central staff but, imagine, worked on a
retainer, doing sports and news broadcasts of special interest,
later to be known as "special events" and requiring large and
important departments.


I began to be assigned to work with Major White, I the
observer, he the announcer of what I saw and passed on to
him. We worked the first horse race on the air, the ZevEpinard
race on a Labor Day at the Belmont Track on Long
Island.


But the one episode of our working tandem that I'll never
forget was the 1924 Democratic National Convention, in the
old Madison Square Garden. Nowadays political conventions
over television are the thing, with no punches pulled in the
heat of argument or internal secrets of excitement sacred;
but to melargely for personal reasons, I admitthere will
never be another event like that 1924 convention. A Canadian

[p. <i>48</i>]

I acted as the Major's leg man, racing around the Garden
to pick up bits of information, political news, hints of
switches in roll-call votes, and color. Speeches, introductions,
ballots, delegation hassles over policies and prerogatives were
punctuated with blasts from bands basking briefly in the glare
of the political sun. My own moments in the sun came when
Major White needed a respite and would take himself off to
lunch at the downtown Newspapermen's Club or some such
oasis, leaving me in charge.


In one of these spells on the air it was my good luck that
a real fight between two delegations mushroomed near my
post, well down in front on the convention floor. Spotting it,
wanting to do well for the glory of WJZ, I concentrated on
the fight and let everything else go by. I explained that one
whole delegation had blustered across the aisle to register a
complaint, following with a blow-by-blow eyewitness account
of one of the finest donnybrooks I'd ever seen. Delegation
signs were banged down on opponent's heads, chairs and decorations
destroyed; I had a ringside seat. I was letting the
listening audience in on the fracas when Major White walked
in. When he grasped what I was doing, his face turned pale,
he grabbed the microphone from me, signaled the operator
to take us off the air, picked up a telephone, and called the
studio. We were off the air only a few seconds. Keith McLeod
came on, placidly playing "Trumerei," while Major White

[p. <i>49</i>]

Back at the studio I received plenty of hints that the powers
were displeased with me for having seized the initiative; but,
too, I detected that they made mental note of my capacity for
spot description. My hopes were justified. Soon I was being
assigned to do special events on my own.


The first was the arrival at Mitchel Field, Long Island, of
the round-the-world fliers. Four planes of the U.S. Army Air
Force, Colonel Lowell H. Smith commanding, had taken off
in April, 1924, from Seattle, to cover a zigzag course over
oceans, deserts, jungles, and arctic wastes; out of the four
starting planes two completed the course of 27,553 miles.
This round-the-world jaunt with many stops was designed to
prove the capacity of the Army Air Force to go successfully
anywhere it elected.


The Mitchel Field reception to the fliers was an important

[p. <i>50</i>]

There were two broadcasts. First, in the afternoon, my
vantage point was a little stand on the field; among the celebrities
to greet the fliers on my microphone were the then
Prince of Wales; the Mayor of New York, John F. Hylan;
the commanding officer of the field; and an assortment of
Washington dignitaries.


I remember how diffident and nervous the Prince of Wales
was as he pinned a medal on the chest of each flier, but I
didn't dwell on it as it might have been thought undignified
for a mere radio announcer so to comment on the mannerisms
of a future King of England. The Prince was good looking,
had great charm, and was a popular figure, so there were
lots of other things to say about him as I watched from a distance
of about three feet.


The second part of the program was the formal reception
for the fliers and the celebration that evening in the officers'
mess. It had been announced in the radio and news columns
as the big feature program of that evening's radio, starting
at eight o'clock.


After the afternoon ceremonies I decided to relax for a
couple of hours, collecting strength and information to make
a good job of the evening assignment.


Following instructions, about seven o'clock I went to the
officers' mess, which I expected to find elaborately decorated
with flags and buntingall good for a couple of minutes' air
descriptionfull of bustle and the impending excitement of
an official military reception, with music, lovely women beautifully
gowned, and dancing.


To my horror on entering the building I found exactly
nothing. The building was empty, there were no lights, no
flags and bunting, no orchestra, no sign of an entertainment
committee, nothing. I was scared to death. Had I mistaken
the building? Had I been given the wrong directions? Had

[p. <i>51</i>]

I raced around the building looking for someone who
could give me some information. Upstairs I found two enlisted
men getting in some sack time. "What about this reception
tonight?" I demanded. But they knew from nothing
and placidly resumed their snoozing. With something less
than an hour before I was due on the air with a gala description,
I was in real trouble.


I found a phone and called the commanding officer's quarters.
An orderly informed me idly that the C. O., discovering
that he had a previous engagement that evening in New
York, had hurriedly held the "reception" in his own home
after the afternoon shindig, therefore everything was all over.
In one blinding flash I saw how new and important radio was
to the Armyso new and so important that nobody had taken
the trouble to inform the station that its day's biggest broadcast
event was off! It certainly left me in a deep hole.


Hurriedly I took stock. The chain was set to carry this
program. If the program went on the air, it would be the
largest feather in my cap to date. Add the fact that there was
no time left for whipping up a program that wouldn't, in
view of all the advance advertising, make a monkey out of
the station, and I had to make a decision. I decided to hold
the reception anyway. Maybe I had heard the expression,
"The show must go on." If I had I doubt if I thought of it
thennot with eight o'clock thirty minutes away.


I tore to an enlisted men's day room (thank God and the
Y.M.C.A. for knowing my way around!) and grabbed a victrola
and an assortment of records: Sousa marches, Viennese
waltzes, some fox trots and two-steps. Back at the officers'
mess (where <i>were</i> all the officers tonight, just when they could
have been useful?), I yelled to the two sleep artists upstairs
to rise and shine. But who were the guests of honor going to
be? More important, now that I thought about it, where were
they?


My good angel was certainly on duty that night. A race to
officers' country turned up two of the fliers, holed up to rest
after the excitement of the day; the other two were in the

[p. <i>52</i>]

One minute before eight arrived. I checked with the studio.
One of the enlisted men started up "Stars and Stripes Forever,"
then the operator's voice said, "You're on the air."
For good or ill I let go.


This important date in the history of aviation ... intrepid
Fliers ... Army Air Force ... magnificence of the scene ...
illustrious guests ... wonderful decorations ... beautifully
gowned women ... handsome uniforms ... receiving line (my
two enlisted men diligently shuffling their feet). Before I let
them go to enjoy the acclaim so richly deserved, I asked permission
to introduce the first of two fliers, told about the
two in the hospital, describing how they looked, how they
were feeling, their little human comments on the great adventure,
and read their little speeches. As a climax I introduced
the commander of the flight; appreciating the spot I was in,
he threw in with me on the make-believe, even including me
in the repeat of the things he had said about the reception
at the C. O.'s house in the afternoon. When it was all over,
I nearly passed out on the mat.


Staggering back to New York and into the studio, I heard
compliments right down the line. I had been of two minds
about making a clean breast of it with the powers. In the
end I just let it ride. Who was going to be helped if I told
what had really happened?


In between spectacular and exciting special events, fundamental
radio was growing in the studio day by day. We were
getting audiences. The problem now was to hold them. In
those days there were no polls, no guides to audience preferences.
We had to feel our way for common denominators of
interest, find talent, and experiment with formats to take advantage
of them.


One of the common denominators was the Children's
Hour, the first thing of its kind, created in 1924 on WJZ

[p. <i>53</i>]

At first it was rotated among announcers, but soon Smith
decided that he liked the way I handled it, and I took it regularly.
My studio salary was still forty-five dollars a week.
Smith gave me twenty dollars and a good dinner every Sunday,
on the side. Sixty-five dollars a week was good pay in
those days for a single kid.


I took to the children, and they took to me; on both sides
the affection is still there. Mary Small was a child prodigy;
I put her on a chair so she could sing level with the microphone.
Eleanor Lanning played the piano, and there were a
lot of others. What I like to remember is that the Children's
Hour made such a place for itself that it withstood all the
organization changes; NBC took it over from WJZ; for many
years it was a success under the name "Coast to coast on a
bus," and in those years I had the satisfaction of bringing
many talented children to the broadcast. Perhaps the original
is dearest to my heart, because, a few years after I had
been carrying it on in New York, I went to Washington and
was asked to organize a Children's Hour down there, which
I did. That's where I first came across a little fat girl by the
name of Katherine Smith. Washington is where she started,
and you know her as Kate Smith.


Although radio was developing fast, it was still pretty primitive;
much of the time we had to make do with off-the-cuff
programs. In other words, if people dropped into the studio
and could perform in any way, we had a program to put on
the air; if no one dropped in, we were stuck. If the weather
was bad, they stayed away in droves. In a single day three
different programs failed to show, and it was up to me to fill
in. For the first I played the ukulele and piano and sang a bit.
By the second I was at my wits' end. Heaven only knows what
made me think of it, but it popped into my head that New
York noise was sort of a trade-mark; the noise of New York
interested everyone who ever came here. In desperation I
pried open one of the windows, dangled a microphone out

[p. <i>54</i>]

When for the third time that day they told me that so-and-so
hadn't shown up and I'd have to fill in the gap, my mind
went blank. Cudgeling my brain as I went into the studio,
my eye fell on a small bookcase standing in the hall. I grabbed
a book at random. When the mike was open, I said impulsively,
"Let's read a story aloud." The book happened to fall
open at a short story by Irvin S. Cobb. Of all crazy titles it
was called "Fish Head." I took my time reading it, watching
the clock anxiously for the moment when I could sign off,
praying that the talent for the next program would be on
hand.


When I got the sign-off signal, I hadn't finished reading
the story so I said, "Well, that's all for today; next time we'll
finish the story of Fish Head." The next morning we had
a bushel of mail. "When are you going to finish Fish Head?
What day? What time?" There were over three thousand
letters. Without knowing it I had stumbled on a formula that
is known as the "cliff hanger"; it borrows from the old silent-movie
serial days when Pearl White would be left at the end
of a reel dangling in some frightful position, as a lure to the
customers to come back to the same theater next week to see
how she managed.


Mr. Popenoe took one look at the grist demanding, "More
Fish Head" and grinned, saying, "O.K., if that's what they
want, give it to them." Now "Fish Head" was a fairly long
story, but even it had an ending. So we rounded up a bunch
of stories to follow it. I was sent on a round of pulp magazine
editors. <i>Detective Stories</i>, published by Street &amp; Smith, I
think, said they would be glad to pick stories out of the
magazine for us, cut them into episodes to fit segments of
air time, rewriting wherever necessary. And so started the
radio continued story. Its characteristic appeal was suspense,
and with the development of dramatic enactment and narration,
it became the forerunner of the present-day serial.


Today possibly there are thousands of radio announcers in

[p. <i>55</i>]

On the surface good fellowship reigned among us. Actually
each man was strictly out for himself; he had to be; in a
business where names could be made overnight, there were
bound to be jealousies. Each announcer knew in his heart
that he was God's gift to radio. The fact that I had been sent
out on remotes of all kinds marked me as a fellow to be
watched, and if possible held down. Radio was becoming a
business of mounting tension, with certain dog-eat-dog overtones.


When one day in early 1925 a staff meeting was called, it
was for many reasons a great day for us all. The purpose of
the meeting was to announce that from now on we would
use our own names in place of the meaningless initials. The
step was taken to meet competition.


In New York our chief competition was WEAF, run by the
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company. Graham McNamee
was chief announcer at WEAF; not only he but Phillips
Carlin and the rest of the station announcers were using
their own names. This fact, coupled with the realization that
radio was fast becoming an entity in its own right and needed
to divest itself of all remaining ties, real or implied, with
marine radio, had overcome the reluctance of management to
let announcers function as individuals, utilizing individual
talents and mannerisms to build reputations.


At first I was panic-stricken. My radio initials, AON, had
become so well-known an identification that I was afraid to
let go of them. As a substitute I thought of Arthur Owen,
which resembled the initials in sound. But "Arthur Owen"
didn't seem to have much zing, so I decided to put my all

[p. <i>56</i>]

These first few months in radio probably marked the greatest
change of all the changes I had known. Here, within six
months, I had become a public personality in my own right;
true, nobody knew who I was or what my name was, but they
knew AON, and AON was me. I received more than a hundred
letters a day. I would cram my pockets with them and
read them between announcements on the outside jobs. The
Canadian boy who was so proud of his first mail-order long
pants was now sporting a tuxedo every night! The boy whose
first knowledge of hotels was the stopover in a fifty-cent room
at the Mills Hotel with his dad when he first came to New
York was now a daily visitor in the best rooms of the best
hotels in the largest city in the world.


At first when I left the Burritts' home in Brooklyn, I was
to take a room on Lexington Avenue with my brother Melvin.
But now I had a very nice room of my own at the Royalton
Hotel on West Forty-third Street, just behind the
building in which I worked. As my wardrobe and manner of
living broadened, so did my horizons. No one knew exactly
the possibilities of radio, but there was no doubt in my mind
that they were limitless. Still, in my heart, I was for some
unknown reason a timid boy. I always felt somehow inadequate.
Each job frightened me until I was actually in the
middle of it. In meeting and working with so many people,
I had acquired a veneer, a front, which I knew sent people
away saying, "He's quite a guy," or "What a character!" I
had a strong handclasp and a pleasant, reassuring smilewhat
they did not know was that I also had a fearful heart. I don't
know if that ugly term inferiority complex had been coined
or not, but I guess that was it with me, and I guess that's
why I was so lonely inside. I was twenty-six years old, yet I
hadn't had a girl since my "steady" in Geneva. I knew nothing
of living, especially sex. I have often said through the

I was drinking but it was not a problem; at least no one
said, "You mustn't." These were speak-easy days, Prohibition,
yet liquor was everywhere. Drinking was smart. Flappers carried
flasks in their handbags or in the tops of their rolled stockings.
When I went to a hotel or night club, the manager
would usually quietly give me a pint, encouraging me to
give the place a good plug. I did discover thisthat for
me it was becoming harder to get over a night's drinking than
it was for my associates. Sometimes after a late night in a
club one or two of us would linger on with the guests and
the proprietors, and I was usually the last to leave. I knew
they had made a lot of fun of me, for there would be writing
in lipstick on my boiled shirt front; and a taxi driver would
have been paid to see that I got safely home. Sometimes when
I had a job to do the next day I'd have to prime myself with
a few drinks to get going. If I did drink like that, it was
more and more by myself, at a place where I was not known,
and over in an inconspicuous corner. My hand shook, and I
was ashamed.


And yet, it still didn't happen too often. I was progressing
nicely in my work; liquor was no problemat least so I
thought.


The program department worked night and day to find
events and personalities who would be listenable to on the
air and build prestige for the station. We had the usual percentage
of unforeseen accidents. One evening the Fred F.
French Company gave a big dinner at the Biltmore Hotel.
The feature of the after-dinner entertainment was the glorious
Mary Garden of the Metropolitan Opera Company.

She was living at the Commodore, and I was sent over to
meet her and gather some program notes. Although I liked
to think that five years in the Big City had given me a glossy
veneer of sophistication, my eyes popped at this glamorous
creature in her dcollet gown and ropes of pearls, and I was
put to it to keep my wits about me.


The function went on the air. After the usual addresses,
after I had made quite a furore about the musical feast to
follow, in which for the first time the great diva, Mary Garden,
would give of her glorious voice by radio, the first few
magical notes went out on the air andbang! The telephone
lines making these out-of-studio broadcasts possible went
dead. In exchange for the rest of Mary Garden's rendition the
audience got reliable old Keith McLeod, playing "Trumerei"
on the piano over at 33 West 42nd Street.
