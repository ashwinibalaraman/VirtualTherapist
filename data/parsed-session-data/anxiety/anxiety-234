<font size="4"><b>Chapter 3: Stress, Immunity, and Health Outcomes</b></font>

The assumption that psychological
stress, physical stress, mood, and
behavior modulate the immune
system, and predispose an individual to illness,
is centuries old. In the sixteenth century,
the Greek physician Galen observed that melancholy
women were more predisposed to the
development of tumors. Today, the assumption
is widely held that stress, emotions, and
behavior affect health, well-being, and predisposition
to disease. For example, a character
proclaims in Woody Allen's film <i>Manhattan</i>,
"I can't express anger, I grow a tumor instead."
Only recently, however, has this mind-immune
relationship been subjected to rigorous
scientific inquiry.


The organized establishment of the science
of psychoneuroimmunology is often
credited to Robert Ader, who first introduced
this term in his presidential address to the
American Psychosomatic Society (Ader,
1980). Ader defined <i>psychoneuroimmunology</i>
as the study of the interactions among behavioral,
neural, endocrine (neuroendocrine), and
immunological processes of adaptation. The
central premise is that an individual's response
and adaptation to the environment is
an integrated process involving interactions
among the nervous, endocrine, and immune
systems. This is in contrast to the traditional
view of the immune system in which it is autonomous
and functions independently of the
other organ systems of the body. Today,
psychoneuroimmunology is a multidisciplinary
science that includes nurses, psychologists,
immunologists, microbiologists, neuroscientists,

[p. <i>48</i>]

Despite the recent development of
psychoneuroimmunology as a discipline, initial
evidence that linked stress to the immune
system was reported by Hans Selye in the
1930s. In his general adaptation syndrome,
Selye described a triad of responses to acute
physical stress that consisted of adrenal gland
enlargement, gastric erosion, and thymic involution
(Selye, 1936, 1976). Since then, scientific
evidence confirming biological links
among the nervous, endocrine, and immune
systems has accumulated. These links include
direct innervation of lymphatic tissue by the
central nervous system and a shared communication
network in which cells of the nervous,
endocrine, and immune systems use
common molecules and receptors to reciprocally
modulate biologic activity. Thoughts,
emotions, and behavior are known to activate
anatomical and biochemical pathways, and
these pathways in turn modulate immune
function (La Via &amp; Workman, 1998). Such
observations and demonstrations have permitted
advocates of psychoneuroimmunology
to suggest that biobehavioral interventions
aimed at strengthening immunocompetence
may be an important component of holistic
health care (Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Glaser, 1992).


- <b>NEURAL-IMMUNE
INTERACTIONS</b>


The connection between the brain and the immune
system is through direct innervation of
lymphoid tissue and through the release of
products from the brain that bind to membrane
receptors on immunologically competent
cells. It is clear that primary and secondary
lymphoid tissues are innervated with
noradrenergic and peptidergic nerve fibers
(Felten et al., 1987). The Feltens's immunohistochemical
studies provide direct evidence
of the close association between presynaptic
sympathetic nerve endings and lymphocytes
and macrophages (Felten, Felten, Carlson,
Olschowka, &amp; Livnat, 1985). Experimentally
produced brain lesions of the hypothalamus,
hippocampus, and cerebral cortex alter immune
function, suggesting a neural-immune
interactive network of connections. Those areas
of the brain that exert immunomodulatory
effects are areas concerned with emotions
and with visceral, autonomic, and neuroendocrine
regulation, thus establishing the
"hardwiring" between neural centers that process
emotions and immune cells. Further verification
of a neural-immune network or axis
was provided when lymphocytes and
macrophages were shown to bear receptors
for adrenergic substances (both α- and β-
adrenergic receptors) and various neuropeptide
hormones, including vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide, somatostatin, calcitonin
gene-related peptide, substance P, and
opioids (Stevens-Felten &amp; Bellinger, 1997).
The presence of such receptors on immune
cells provides a mechanism whereby
the immune system can respond to biochemical
signals from the brain. Activation of these
receptors leads to functional changes in immune
response (i.e., lymphocyte proliferation,
cytotoxicity, antibody production, and
cytokine secretion).


A pivotal step in firmly establishing that
the brain and immune system interact was accomplished
by psychologists who, using animal
models, demonstrated that classical psychological
(Pavlovian) conditioning could
produce immunologic changes (Ader &amp; Cohen,
1993). Such conditioning and its effect
on the immune system have been demonstrated
clinically. For example, research has
documented the occurrence of anticipatory
immunosuppression prior to the administration
of chemotherapy (Bovbjerg et al., 1990;
Fredrikson, Furst, Lekander, Rothstein, &amp;
Blomgren, 1993).


Investigators continue to unravel the intricate
interplay among the nervous, endocrine,
and immune systems. The associated
immunologic changes that occur in response
to neuroendocrine mediators, however, are

[p. <i>49</i>]

Adding additional complexity, it is well
established that not only do nerves and secretory
products from the brain influence immune
function but also the converse is true.
Immune activation can modulate central nervous
system activity. Hugo Besedovsky and
collaborators conducted seminal studies,
which demonstrated that antigenic challenge
of the immune system can produce an increase
in neural firing within the medial hypothalamus
(Besedovsky, Felix, &amp; Haas, 1977).
A peak immune response was associated with
a decrease in norepinephrine turnover. Cytokines
produced by antigen-activated lymphoid
cells altered the turnover of norepinephrine
(Besedovsky, del Rey, Prada, Burri,
&amp; Honegger, 1983).


It is now understood that alterations in
cytokine secretion subsequent to immune activation
mediate behavioral effects often associated
with illness. For example, interleukin-1
(IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α ) mediate sickness behavior (the fatigue,
lethargy, and decreased appetite associated
with infectious illness) (Dantzer et al.,
1998). Because they are large protein molecules,
cytokines do not readily cross the
blood-brain barrier. They are believed to signal
the brain by entering neural structures that
do not possess tight capillary endothelial barriers,
such as the organum vasculosum
laminae terminalis and area postrema. In addition,
recent evidence indicates that cytokines
released in the periphery can activate sensory
afferents, such as vagal afferents, and signal
central nervous system (CNS) areas involved
in immune-related behavioral responses
(Watkins, Meier, &amp; Goehler, 1995).


Collectively, this evidence supports the
concept of a dynamic neuroendocrineimmune
network whereby soluble products of
immunologically competent cells affect the
CNS following antigenic challenge. It is this
conceptualization that led Blalock to liken the
immune system to a sensory organ capable of
informing the CNS of an antigenic challenge
(Blalock &amp; Smith, 1985).


Both psychological and physical stressors
are known to activate neuroendocrine
pathways that interact with the immune system
(Chrousos, 1998). Stressor activation
leads to increased secretion of neurosecretory
hormones from the hypothalamus, such as
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). In
turn, these hypothalamic hormones regulate
secretion of pituitary hormones, such as
adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and
endorphins. Because there are shared hormonal
receptors on cells of the immune and
neuroendocrine systems, reciprocal interactions
between these systems are possible
(Reichlin, 1993; Weigent &amp; Blalock, 1999).
Neuroendocrine secretory products have
immunomodulatory effects and alter leukocyte
function (e.g., the immunologic effects of
glucocorticoids, endorphins, ACTH, growth
hormone, and prolactin). These effects include
the regulation of cytokine secretion, antibody
synthesis, natural killer cell (NK) activity,
and lymphocyte proliferation (Weigent
&amp; Blalock, 1999). The complex interactions
between the neuroendocrine and immune systems
are believed to, in part, downregulate inflammatory
responses and limit continuous
proliferation of lymphoid cells or excessive
production of immune cell products or both
(Munck &amp; Guyre, 1986).


Interestingly, neuroendocrine hormones
can be produced by leukocytes, the most well
studied of which is proopiomelanocorticotropin

[p. <i>50</i>]

The bidirectional nature of the neuroendocrine
and immune systems likely accounts
for the effect of stress on the immune
system (Figure 3.1). Regulatory hormones
and neuropeptides once believed to be confined
to the brain or endocrine system or both
are now known to be mutually expressed by
all three systems (nervous, endocrine, and
immune), and as a result each system may be
capable of modulating the function of the
other.


In summary, during the past 15 years empirical
evidence has emerged that supports the
existence of a communication network linking
the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems.
Psychological stimuli modulate the immune
response either through direct activation
of neural pathways that terminate in lymphoid
tissue or by activation of neuroendocrine circuits
leading to the release of molecules that
bind to immunologically competent cells.
Conversely, the immune system recognizes
noncognitive stimuli, such as bacteria, fungi,
and viruses, resulting in the secretion of an array
of cytokines that act on receptors of the
neuroendocrine system. Collectively, cognitive
and noncognitive stimuli form a network,
which is the basis for behaviorally induced alterations
in immune function (Weigent &amp;
Blalock, 1999). It is likely that this neuroendocrine-immune
network mediates the effect
of stress on the development or progression
or both of immune-based disease.


- <b>STRESS AND IMMUNITY</b>


Stressful life events, and the subsequent emotional
and behavioral responses to these
events, are commonly believed to alter immunity.
When external demands (i.e., stressors)
exceed an individual's adaptive capabilities, a
stress response ensues (Lazarus &amp; Folkman,
1984). It is the subsequent neurological and
endocrinological changes that are believed to
produce stress-elicited immune alterations.
Studies during the past decade provide convincing
evidence that psychological stress
can affect the immune system (e.g., lymphocyte
proliferation, NK activity, antibody synthesis,
and cytokine production). These studies
have been accomplished with animal
models and in human stress situations, including
both experimentally produced stress
and naturalistic paradigms for stress evaluation.
This chapter focuses on the major human
stress paradigms.


Early studies supporting the effects of
stress on immunity were conducted by the research
team of Glaser and Kiecolt-Glaser.
These investigators conducted a series of
stress studies in medical students that demonstrated
the immunosuppressive effects of in-class
examinations (Kiecolt-Glaser, Garner,
Speicher, Penn, &amp; Glaser, 1984). The results
of these studies indicate that the stress that accompanies
examinations leads to a wide range
of immunosuppressive effects, including decreased
NK cell activity (Glaser, Rice, &amp;
Speicher, 1986), lymphocyte proliferation
(Glaser et al., 1987), IFN-γ production
(Glaser et al., 1986), IL-2 production (Glaser
et al., 1990), and latent viral activation as evidenced
by increased antibody titer to the virus
(Glaser et al., 1992).

Figure 3.1. Summary and possible interconnections by which environmental stimuli, or stress, can
affect the immune response and health outcomes. Perceived environmental stress is mediated by the
central nervous system and can lead to neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system activation. As a
result, the immune response can be altered by autonomic nerve fibers that directly synapse with
immune cells and by circulating catecholamines released from the adrenal medulla. In addition, further
alteration can be produced by secretory products (hormones and neuropeptides) released from the
pituitary and endocrine target glands (adrenal cortex, thyroid, ovaries, and testes). In turn, feedback
(dashed lines) from immune cell products (cytokines) can modulate endocrine and central nervous
system activity by either humoral or neural communication networks.

Furthermore, medical students with
lower anxiety levels had faster and stronger
immune responses to hepatitis B vaccination
than did students with higher levels of anxiety
(Glaser et al., 1992; Glaser, Kiecolt-Glaser,
Malarkey, &amp; Sheridan, 1998). Recently, examination
stress was shown to alter cytokine
production that shifts the cytokine pattern
away from a Th1 to a Th2 type of response
(Maes et al., 1998). This shift is characterized
by a decrease in secretion of IFN and an increased
secretion of IL-10. The authors suggest
that the shift in cytokine production may
partially explain the increased incidence of

[p. <i>52</i>]

The type of immune response seen as a
result of stress is dependent on the acute versus
chronic or repeated nature of the stressful
event (McEwen, 1998). For example, acute
stressors, such as parachute jumping, are correlated
with a mobilization in the numbers of
NK cells; this is likely attributable to a change
in cell trafficking related to adrenergic arousal
(Schedlowski et al., 1993) or glucocorticoid
secretion (McEwen, 1998) or both. Studies
such as these suggest that acute stress produces
a redistribution of lymphocytes and
macrophages in the body. These cells
marginate on blood vessel walls and compartmentalize
in the skin, lymph nodes, and bone
marrow. It is theorized that acute stress activates
the immune response and prepares the
organism for potential encounters with an immunologic
challenge. This activation may exacerbate
autoimmune or allergic responses
(Dhabhar, Miller, McEwen, &amp; Spencer,
1996). Repeated or chronic stress, however,
suppresses immune responsiveness, particularly
cell-mediated immunity, and increases
susceptibility to infectious challenge and tumor
cells (McEwen, 1998). Chronic stressors,
such as bereavement, caregiving, marital conflict,
and divorce, impair the ability of NK
cells to be lytic and to respond to cytokines
(IFN-y or IL-2) <i>in vitro</i> (Esterling, Kiecolt-Glaser,
&amp; Glaser, 1996; Herbert &amp; Cohen,
1993; Kiecolt-Glaser, Dura, Speicher, Trask,
&amp; Glaser, 1991; Kiecolt-Glaser, Glaser,
Cacioppo, &amp; Malarkey, 1998). Other aspects
of cellular immunity are also affected by
chronic stress (Herbert &amp; Cohen, 1993), including
decreased lymphoproliferation, NK
cell activity, numbers of circulating lymphocytes,
as well as salivary and serum immunoglobulin
levels.


The impact of chronic stress has been
poignantly illustrated by assessing the immune
response of individuals caring for relatives
with Alzheimer's disease. Kiecolt-Glaser
et al. (1987) found that such caregiving
was accompanied by greater distress and
heightened levels of herpes virus-specific
antibody (suggesting viral reactivation). Furthermore,
elderly individuals experiencing the
chronic stress of caring for a spouse with Alzheimer's
disease had attenuated responses to
the influenza vaccine and more physician-confirmed
respiratory infections than control
subjects. Health behaviors did not differ between
the two groups.


Conversely, Irwin et al. (1991) reported
no differences in NK cell activity between
caregivers and control subjects. Esterling et
al. (1996), however, found that both caregivers
and former caregivers (those whose relative
had died at least 2 years previously) had
blunted NK cell activity compared to
nonstressed control subjects. Interestingly, the
results of this study suggested that the psychological
and immunological aftermath of
caregiving persists beyond the actual stressful
experience. In an attempt to reverse the
immunosuppressive effects of stress in the elderly,
these investigators enrolled subjects in a
1-month stress-reduction program that used
progressive muscle relaxation. This form of
stress reduction produced a 30% increase in
NK cell activity (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1985).


The type and magnitude of stress-elicited
effects on the immune system are influenced
by many factors. Such factors may relate to
the stressor, such as the type, intensity, and
duration of the stressful stimulus. The sampling
time frame between the stressor and the
immune response can also influence whether
an effect can be measured. Furthermore, not
all components of the immune system may respond
to a stressor. Therefore, it is important
that the immune parameter to be measured be
carefully chosen within the context of the
population or illness studied or both. A variety
of host or subject factors will also influence
the immune response to stress, such as age,
preexisting illness, nutritional status, substance
abuse, exercise habits, adequacy of
sleep, coping, and social support (Kiecolt-Glaser
&amp; Glaser, 1988; Zeller, McCain,
McCann, Swanson, &amp; Colletti, 1996).


The primary criticism of many stress-immune
studies is that although the immune
change observed is often statistically significant,

[p. <i>53</i>]

- <b>STRESS-IMMUNITY AND
HEALTH OUTCOMES</b>


One fundamental question that remains unanswered
in the field of psychoneuro-immunology
is whether or not stress-induced
alteration in immune function plays a role in
disease development or disease progression
or both. Numerous studies, although inconclusive,
have shown stress to influence the
course or progression of illness or disease
(e.g., cancer, infectious disease, and HIV).
Few studies, however, provide definitive evidence
that links stress, immunity, and health
outcomes. This area remains a challenge for
researchers in psychoneuroimmunology.


One of a handful of well-controlled studies
that examined the effect of psychological
stress on susceptibility to illness was conducted
by Cohen et al. (1991). They investigated
the relationship between stress and the
common cold using a viral challenge paradigm.
Following extensive health and psychological
assessment (for the previous 12
months), 394 volunteers were randomized to
receive either a low infectious dose of a respiratory
virus or saline. For 2 days prior to viral
challenge and 7 days postchallenge, volunteers
were quarantined. Rhinovirus infection
was based on the development of clinical
symptoms of a cold, the development of virus-specific
antibodies, and the culture and isolation
of the inoculated virus. The results revealed
that psychological stress predicted susceptibility
to colds among the initially healthy
people exposed to the respiratory virus. Psychological
stress was operationalized as an
index of the number of negative life events,
the perceived impact of these negative life
events, perceived stress, and negative affect.
In a related study, Cohen et al. analyzed the
relationship of an individual's social contacts
to the development of the common cold. In
276 volunteers exposed to rhinovirus, a
greater resistance to upper respiratory infection
was exhibited in subjects who had the
greatest diversity of social contacts (friends,
family, and community). Interestingly, greater
resistance to infection was related to increased
numbers of social contacts and not to
the absolute number of individuals involved in
the social contacts (Cohen, Doyle, Skoner,
Rabin, &amp; Gwaltney, 1997). Recently, these investigators
reported that acute stressful life
events (less than 1 month in duration) were
not associated with the onset of colds. Severe
chronic stressors (1 month or longer in duration),
however, were associated with the risk
of cold development. The most prevalent
chronic stressors for this study group were under-
or unemployment or enduring interpersonal
difficulties with family or friends
(Cohen et al., 1998).


- <b>STRESS AND WOUND HEALING</b>


Studies of the effects of stress on wound healing
and tissue repair have suggested that
stress-induced neuroendocrine activation impairs
healing and delays recovery. Both animal
and human models of wound healing
have been used to examine the effects of
stress. In one study (Padgett, Marucha, &amp;
Sheridan, 1998), the effects of restraint stress
on the healing of a sterile punch wound in rats
were studied. Rats were subjected to restraint
stress for 3 days prior to and for 5 days after
wounding. Wound healing was measured using
photography and image analysis.
Compared to control rats, which were
wounded but not restrained, healing was delayed
an average of 3 days in the restraint
stressed group. Treatment of the restraint
stressed group with a glucocorticoid receptor

[p. <i>54</i>]

The ability of stress to delay wound healing
has also been shown in human stress paradigms.
Kiecolt-Glaser, Marucha, Malarkey,
Mercado, and Glaser (1995) studied the effects
of chronic stress on caregivers (spouses)
for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
Punch biopsy wounds were applied to
caregivers and age-matched control subjects.
The results indicated that wound healing was
markedly delayed in the caregivers compared
to control subjects. These differences were
not related to other covariates, such as nutrition,
sleep, or the presence of other illnesses.
In another study, wound healing was delayed
by the more acute and benign stress of academic
examinations. Two punch biopsy
wounds were placed on the hard palate of dental
students during summer vacation and then
on the contralateral side 3 days prior to the
first major exam of the term. Mucosal wound
healing took 3 days longer to complete during
the exam period. The production of mRNA
for IL-1β was also reduced during the stress of
examination (Marucha, Kiecolt-Glaser, &amp;
Favagehi, 1998).


In summary, the previously discussed
studies provide compelling evidence suggesting
that stress can impair tissue repair and
wound healing. This can have significant implications
for recovery from injury and
surgery, especially in vulnerable populations,
such as individuals with diabetes, impaired
tissue perfusion, and advanced age. Delayed
healing of wounds increases the risk for
wound complication by infectious pathogens,
which can further prolong recovery and length
of hospital stay. Nurses are in a pivotal position
to recognize and reduce stress and to
teach stress management skills. This has the
potential to promote both healing and recovery
and enhance health outcomes.


- <b>STRESS-IMMUNITY AND
CANCER</b>


The immune system is believed to play a role
in surveillance against malignantly transformed
cells. It has been hypothesized that
stress-induced suppression of immune cell
activity (e.g., NK cell activity) may alter the
clinical course of cancer. The relationship between
NK cell activity and cancer is complex
(Rosenberg &amp; Lotze, 1986). NK cells, however,
are also important in the control of viral
infections (Trinchieri, 1989; Whiteside &amp;
Herberman, 1989). As such, NK cells may
prevent the development of infectious complications
in cancer patients who are often
immunosuppressed.


There are a few highly intriguing studies
that have examined the relationship between
stress and immunity in cancer patients. Levy
et al. (1990) found that estrogen receptor status
predicted NK cell activity in 66 women
with Stage I or II breast cancer 3 months after
surgery with or without adjuvant therapy.
These researchers also showed that social support
contributed significantly to a regression
model predicting higher NK cell activity. That
is, the greater an individual's social support,
the higher the individual's NK cell activity.


Andersen et al. (1998) studied stress-immune
parameters in 116 women who were diagnosed
with invasive breast cancer (Stages II
and III). Women were enrolled within 4
months of their breast surgery but prior to

[p. <i>55</i>]

Researchers have begun to address the
definitive question as to whether psychosocial
interventions can produce health effects that
slow cancer progression and promote survival
(Fawzy, Fawzy, Arndt, &amp; Pasnau, 1995; Greer
&amp; Brady, 1988; Speigel, 1996). Randomized
prospective trials have shown protective effects
of psychosocial interventions on cancer
progression (Spiegel, Sephton, Terr, &amp; Stites,
1998). Fawzy et al. (1993) studied the effects
of a behavioral intervention in patients with
malignant melanoma. Subjects were randomized
to an intervention consisting of six 90-minute
sessions including health education,
stress management, coping skills, and group
discussion. Six months later, the intervention
group showed reduced psychological distress
and enhanced immune function (increased
IFN-α and augmented NK cell activity) compared
to the nonintervention group. Although
no association between survival and NK cell
activity was found, individuals with higher
baseline NK cell activity had a decreased incidence
of disease recurrence.


In another study, the effects of a home
visit and educational intervention program for
lymphoma and leukemia patients were investigated
(Richardson, Shelton, Krailo, &amp; Levine,
1990). The results showed that patients
in the intervention group were more compliant
with their medical treatment. More important,
when controlling for this difference,
members of the intervention group lived significantly
longer than members of the control
group.


A landmark study that assessed the effect
of behavioral intervention on cancer survival
was conducted by David Spiegel and
colleagues (1989). They reported compelling
results suggesting that an intervention, characterized
as supportive-expressive group therapy,
increased the survival of women with advanced
breast cancer. Fifty of 86 women with
advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned
to support groups. The groups were designed
to build strong supportive bonds, encourage
"emotional expressiveness" about
cancer, confront fears of dying and death, reorder
life's priorities, improve relationships
with family and friends, enhance communication
with and development of shared problem
solving with physicians, and teach self-hypnosis
for pain control (Spiegel et al., 1998).
The women were followed for 10 years, and a
significant 18-month increase in survival for
women in the intervention group was observed.
Further analysis of the results of this
study, in which medical records were reviewed,
showed no difference in therapeutic
treatment that could account for the differences
in survival. Rather, a correlation was
found between group support and survival.
Spiegel's research team is currently replicating
this study with a larger group in which endocrine
markers of stress and cellular immune
response, including NK cell activity, are being
measured in addition to survival. It is hypothesized
that psychosocial support will buffer
the immunological consequences of cancer-associated
stress and thereby improve disease
outcomes (Spiegel et al., 1998).


In addition to the ongoing study of
Spiegel, Andersen and colleagues (1998) are
conducting a prospective, randomized study
evaluating the effectiveness of stress-reduction
interventions on psychological, immunological,
and survival outcomes in women with
advanced breast cancer. The structured intervention
includes several stress-reduction strategies,

[p. <i>56</i>]

The role of psychological stress in cancer
progression or response to treatment or both
remains controversial, as was expressed in an
editorial by Cohen and Rabin (1998). They
contend that it is not clear if the effects of behavioral
interventions are due to an individual's
greater adherence to a healthy lifestyle
or to the behavioral intervention therapy or
both. The results of behavioral-based intervention
studies are highly provocative and difficult
to ignore, however. Indeed, the results of
the ongoing clinical trials will provide further
data that will aid in the understanding of the
importance of stress, its impact on the immune
system, and cancer control.


- <b>STRESS-IMMUNITY
AND HIV</b>


Individuals living with HIV face numerous
stressors, such as family discord, change in
occupation, economic hardship, social isolation,
and bereavement (McCain &amp; Zeller,
1996; Robinson, Mathews, &amp; Witek-Janusek,
2000). Because the immune system plays a
dominant role in the prevention of viral infections
and in the suppression of latent viral infections,
stress-induced changes in immune
function may alter disease progression. Evidence
suggests that stress-induced modulation
of immunity may alter the course of HIV
infection (McCain &amp; Zeller, 1996; Robinson
et al., 2000). Psychological variables are hypothesized
to mediate host resistance to the
HIV virus by modifying behavioral practices
and by promoting an optimal neuroendocrine
and immune milieu. Overall, most of these
studies are fraught with methodological difficulties,
such as small and nonhomogeneous
samples, lack of control for treatment and disease
stage variables, inability to document or
measure the presence of psychosocial stress
in the sample, and lack of sensitive and relevant
indices of immune measures. Nevertheless,
the results are intriguing.


Goodkin, Fuchs, Feaster, Leeka, and
Rishel (1992) studied stress-immune correlates
in asymptomatic HIV-positive males. Although
the sample size was small, the results
suggested that men with a lower ability to
cope with stress had lower total lymphocyte
counts, whereas men with higher coping abilities
had greater numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes.
A series of stress-immune studies have
originated from the University of Miami's
Center for the Biopsychosocial Study of
AIDS; some of these studies have evaluated
the psychoimmune effects of the stress of HIV
antibody testing (i.e., test notification stress).
This research team reported a significant relationship
between increased anxiety (State
Trait Anxiety Index [STAI]) at the time of notification
of test results and decreased NK cell
activity. No association with lymphocyte proliferation
was found (Ironson et al., 1990).


In a similar study, during a 5-week period
before and after HIV testing, seropositive subjects
reported higher anxiety (STAI), higher
depression, increased intrusive thoughts, and
lower lymphocyte proliferation rates than
seronegative subjects. Although plasma cortisol
levels declined significantly in the sero-positive
group during the study period, they
were within normal limits (Antoni et al.,
1991). McCain and Cella (1995) found a significant
relationship between high stress and
lower CD4+ cell numbers in their study of a
heterogeneous group (heterosexuals, minorities,
injecting drug users, and those with various
stages of disease progression) of 53 men
with HIV disease. These same investigators
examined the effect of a stress management
intervention in HIV-positive individuals. Although
a reduction in stress was demonstrated,
they failed to show any significant accompanying

[p. <i>57</i>]

Although there is no clear mechanism for
how stress influences HIV disease progression,
Clerici and colleagues (1994) proposed
an "immunoendocrinological" hypothesis implicating
the potential role of elevated cortisol
in the progression of HIV disease through
modulatory effects on viral replication,
cytokine modulation, and increased induction
of apoptosis. Supportive evidence for this theory
has been provided by reports that cortisol
enhances HIV viral infections when added to
cell culture medium containing human lymphocytes
(Markham, Salahuddin, Veren,
Orndorff, &amp; Gallo, 1986) and HIV viral replication
when added to monocyte cultures
(Swanson, Zeller, &amp; Spear, 1998). Norepinephrine,
a major catecholamine released during
stress, also accelerates HIV replication
(Cole, Korin, Fahe, &amp; Zack, 1998).


It is likely that studies examining psychoneuroimmune
parameters in HIV disease are
limited by the immune outcome variables
measured. It is possible that psychological effects
may not have a measurable impact on indices
of HIV disease development or progression
or both. More important, stress may play
an important role in the HIV-infected person's
susceptibility to opportunistic infection. Consequently,
there is a need to design and implement
studies aimed at determining the role of
psychological stress on immune system indices
designed to measure defense mechanisms
important in host defense against opportunistic
infection (Robinson et al., 2000). The nature
of the stress-immune relationship in HIV
disease needs to be carefully evaluated within
the context of currently used antiretroviral
therapy and within the context of future therapeutic
approaches. Such therapies may not
only alter immune responsiveness in those
with HIV but also influence the type of stress
they encounter as they live with HIV.


- <b>STRESS-IMMUNITY AND
INFECTION</b>


Vulnerable populations, such as cancer patients
and persons with HIV, face a multitude
of stressors. These stressors can influence the
immune system and increase susceptibility to
infectious diseases. Psychological stress
seems to alter the susceptibility of individuals
to infectious agents and influences the onset,
course, and outcome of the pathology associated
with infection (Biondi &amp; Zannino,
1997). Moreover, infectious disease can be a
stressor. The human body's response to infection
and to immunological challenge resembles
both physical and psychological stress
(Dunn, Powell, Meitin, &amp; Small, 1989).


Infection can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis (HPA) axis and increase
the synaptic release of norepinephrine and serotonin
in the brain (Dunn, 1993). Thus, by
physiological criteria, infection can be regarded
as stressful. The activation of the HPA
axis associated with immune responses has
been interpreted as a signal to the brain indicating
the presence of an infectious threat
from the external environment, triggering a
stress response (Blalock &amp; Smith, 1985).
Once an effective immune response has been
initiated, the HPA axis is thought to negatively
regulate the immune system by the release of
glucocorticoids that limit the inflammatory
response and prevent overreactivity and autoimmune
phenomena (Besedovsky, del Rey,
Sorkin, &amp; Dinarello, 1986; Munck &amp; Guyre,
1986). Thus, the effects of stress on the immune
system and the effects of the immune
system on the neurologic response to infection
are a complex and interrelated series of

[p. <i>58</i>]

<b><i>Tuberculosis</i></b>


Stress has long been associated with the
pathogenesis of tuberculosis. With the recent
resurgence of tuberculosis, understanding the
potential role of stress in susceptibility to and
progression of this infectious disease has become
even more important. In previous studies,
high rates of tuberculosis have been
reported among socially isolated individuals
and in schoolchildren and their teachers
during periods of emotional stress, such as
during war (Guyre, Girard, Morganelli, &amp;
Manganiello, 1988; Ishigami, 1919). These
studies showed a reduced capacity of the infected
individuals to phagocytize the infectious
agent and suggested that stressful situations
might serve as cofactors in the
development of tuberculosis. Until recently,
very little evidence existed to support this suggestion.
Work using experimental animals has
shown that HPA axis activation, induced by
restraint stress, increased the growth of the tubercle
bacillus (Zwilling et al., 1990).
Adrenalectomy and treatment with the
glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 abrogated
this effect. Furthermore, HPA axis activation
suppressed phagocyte function and
decreased the capacity of the animals to produce
immune augmenting cytokines in response
to the mycobacteria (Brown, Sheridan,
Pearl, &amp; Zwilling, 1993).


The effects of stress in experimental animals
may have important implications in human
disease. In an extensive study, tubercular
patients were shown to have a dramatic increase
in the number of stressful life events
approximately 2 years prior to their hospitalization
(Homes, Hawkins, Bowerman, Clarke,
&amp; Joffe, 1957). Likewise, mortality due to tuberculosis
has been shown to be higher in subjects
who have experienced divorce (Somers,
1979). It is possible that the reactivation of tuberculosis
may be a consequence of susceptible
populations being affected by stressors.
Stress, mediated by neuroendocrine-immune
interactions, may significantly contribute to
this infectious disease, which continues to be
a serious health hazard worldwide.


<b><i>Viral Infections</i></b>


Colds and influenza have been useful
models to evaluate the role of psychoneuro-immunology
in human disease. As discussed
previously, Cohen et al. (1991) evaluated the
significance of psychosocial factors on the
common cold. Subjects were inoculated with
respiratory viruses, and the risk of developing
the infectious disease was directly associated
with chronic stress. This study and many others
showed similar effects of stress on the development
of colds and influenza but no direct
effect of stress on the immune system of the
more susceptible individuals (Clover, Abell,
Becker, Crawford, &amp; Ramsey, 1989).


Many other studies have evaluated the effects
of stress on latent viral infections caused
by herpes simplex virus, EBV, and HIV. These
viruses are typically latent in humans, and the
hypothesis that stress favors viral reactivation
has been evaluated. These studies have shown
that exposure to acute psychological stressors
(e.g., examinations and spousal, discord) and
chronic psychological stressors (e.g., nuclear
disaster and caregiving) is associated with
high antibody titers to these viruses. These viruses
are thought to be controlled by normal
host cell-mediated immune response. When
stress reduces the cell-mediated immune response,
the virus replicates and stimulates an
antibody response that is typically non-protective
(Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1991). In the
case of genital herpes, Kemeny, Cohen,
Zegans, and Conant (1989) showed that a negative
mood state was correlated with a decrease
in CD8+ lymphocytes (the principal
effector against herpesvirus) and herpetic lesion
recurrence. Likewise, psychological
stress has been shown to predispose an individual
to the onset of infectious mononucleosis
(Glaser et al., 1991). This work remains

[p. <i>59</i>]

<b><i>Fungal Infections</i></b>


Although the association between emotional
stress and infectious mycological disease
has been long suspected, only recently
has considerable attention been paid to this association.
Fungal infections are well-known
to be associated with the stressful conditions
of pregnancy, surgical trauma, cancer, organ
transplants, long-term antibiotic use, cortico-steroid
therapy, diabetes mellitus, critical illness,
and prematurity (Reszel, Mishra, Mishra,
&amp; Pierson, 1993; Shareef, Myers, Nagab-hushan,
Mathews, &amp; Witek-Janusek, 1998;
Witek-Janusek, Cusack, &amp; Mathews, 1998).


Stress hormones such as cortisol and
adrenaline are known to enhance pathogenesis
of experimental fungal disease (Odds,
1988). For example, <i>Candida albicans</i> and related
fungi are endogenous opportunists, and
infections with these fungi are typically associated
with debilitating or predisposing conditions
or both. <i>Candida</i> infections are the first
symptom of active AIDS to appear in HIV-positive
individuals. One factor shared by
AIDS patients and the other susceptible individuals
described previously is hormonal imbalance
resulting from HPA axis activation.
Furthermore, emotionally affected women
who perceive their situation to be stressful
have a higher incidence of vaginal <i>Candida</i>
infections (Reszel et al., 1993). Candidiasis
also appears frequently in people undergoing
surgery, a unique form of stress that involves
emotional stressors (anxiety), chemical stressors
(anesthesia), and physical stressors (surgery)
(Mishra et al., 1994). Similarly, the
emotional stress of divorce has been positively
correlated with increased incidence of
the carriage of <i>Candida</i> (Reszel et al., 1993).
Such associations of stress and fungal infection
in vulnerable populations are only beginning
to be understood.


- <b>STRESS-IMMUNITY AND
NURSING SCIENCE</b>


The holistic view of human nature ascribed to
by the discipline of nursing is harmonious
with the philosophical underpinnings of
psychoneuroimmunology (McCain &amp; Smith,
1994; Zeller, McCain, &amp; Swanson, 1996). As
a result, nurse researchers have used a
psychoneuroimmunological framework in
their research and have made significant contributions
to the scientific growth of this field.
Nurse investigators have examined stress-immune
interactions in a variety of immune-based
illnesses, including asthma, HIV, and
cancer. In addition, nurse scientists have documented
the immunosuppressive nature of
postoperative pain and the effects of stress on
wound healing. A psychoneurouimmunologic
framework has also been used to understand
the immunologic implications of child
birth and postpartal stress on maternal-infant
well-being. Some of these studies are addressed
in the following discussion.


Asthmatic symptoms can often be initiated
and potentiated by stressful life events.
Kang et al. studied the effect of examination
stress in asthmatic and nonasthmatic adolescents.
Their results revealed that examination
stress produces significant alterations in circulating
immune cell subsets and in both
proliferative and cytolytic activities. No differences
were found between the asthmatic
and nonasthmatic adolescents, however. Both
healthy and asthmatic adolescents reported
similar levels of stress and similar changes in
immune cell numbers and function (Kang,
Coe, Karaszewski, &amp; McCarthy, 1998; Kang,
Coe, &amp; McCarthy, 1996). The lack of a relationship
between asthma status and social
support was believed to be due to the stability
and well-managed nature of this asthmatic
population (Kang, Coe, McCarthy, &amp; Ershler,
1997). In a similar study, examination stress
in adolescent asthmatics produced a bias toward
a Th2-like pattern of cytokine production
compared to that of nonasthmatic adolescents
(Kang, Coe, McCarthy, et al., 1997).
These studies are suggestive and need to be

[p. <i>60</i>]

The laboratory of Gayle Page conducted
a series of compelling experiments in rodents
that showed that untreated postoperative
pain led to impaired NK cell activity and
enhanced tumor metastases (Ben-Eliyahu,
Page, Yirmiya, &amp; Shakhar, 1999; Page &amp; Ben-Eliyahu,
1997; Page, Ben-Eliyahu, &amp; Liebes-kind,
1994; Page, Ben-Eliyahu, Yirmiya, &amp;
Liebeskind, 1993). In her model, rats were
subjected to laparotomy and injected with NK
cell-sensitive radiolabeled tumor cells that
metastasized to the lung. Rats that were
treated with morphine, and that exhibited
signs of pain relief, had significantly less
radiolabeled tumor in the lung, fewer metastatic
lesions on the lung, and higher postoperative
NK cell activity (Page et al., 1993,
1994). These results suggest that untreated
postoperative pain leads to impaired immune
function (e.g., reduced NK cell activity) and
potentially increased organ localization of tumor
emboli. In addition, this research group
has demonstrated that the degree of postoperative
pain immunosuppression is related to the
estrus stage of the rat, suggesting that reproductive
hormones may affect the stress-immune
response to surgical stress (Ben-Eliyahu,
Page, Shakhar, &amp; Taylor, 1996). As a
whole, the studies of Page and colleagues indicate
that the treatment of pain is necessary
not only to alleviate suffering but also to prevent
pain-induced immunosuppression and
possible tumor metastatic spread. Although
these observations have been made in animal
models, others have shown in humans that
surgery for tumor resection leads to a postoperative
reduction in NK cell activity compared
to preoperative levels (Pollack, Lotzova, &amp;
Stanford, 1992). Evidence that healing and recovery
from surgery are potentially altered by
stress has also been provided by Wysocki
(1996), who found that noise stress delayed
wound healing in an animal model. Also, McCarthy,
Ouimet, and Daun (1991) have provided
evidence that noise stress alters lymphoid
cell function needed for tissue repair.
The previously discussed results support the
supposition that an individual's psychological
state can influence surgical recovery by altering
various aspects of immunity (Kiecolt-Glaser,
Page, Marucha, MacCullum, &amp;
Glaser, 1998).


<b><i>Immunity and HIV Progression</i></b>


Living with HIV is replete with multiple
stressors, and nurse scientists have contributed
to the supposition that the stress-endocrine-immune
axis is implicated in HIV disease
progression (McCain &amp; Cella, 1995;
McCain &amp; Gramling, 1992; Robinson,
Matthews, &amp; Witek-Janusek, 1999a; Robinson
et al., 1999b). Stress-induced neuroendocrine
activation leads to elevations in
plasma cortisol. <i>In vitro</i>, physiological concentrations
of cortisol increase HIV replication
in monocyte-derived macrophages, suggesting
a potential role for stress hormones in
HTV disease activation and progression
(Swanson et al., 1998). The effectiveness of
stress-reducing interventions in HIV disease
has been evaluated by McCain et al. In a pre-test-posttest
design, the effect of a 6-week
stress management program in HIV disease
was evaluated (McCain et al., 1996). Outcome
measures at 6 weeks and 6 months included
perceived stress, quality of life, psychological
distress, illness-related uncertainty, and CD4+
T lymphocyte levels. Although the program
improved measures of emotional well-being,
no significant changes in CD4+ lymphocyte
levels were detected. It is likely that CD4+
lymphocyte number may not be a sensitive indicator
of improvement in immune function,
and other types of immunological assessment
may yield more positive results.


In an ongoing intervention study, Robinson
and colleagues are examining the efficacy
of an 8-week, mindfulness meditation-based
stress-reduction program on psychoimmune
variables in HIV-positive individuals. These
investigators are measuring NK cell activity,
which is an important host defense mechanism
against viral infections, and opportunistic
microbial infections, which cause significant
morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive

[p. <i>61</i>]

Stress-induced immunosuppression may
have special relevance to the nursing care of
cancer patients who undergo immunosuppressive
therapies. The emotional stress of
undergoing breast biopsy for cancer diagnosis
has been clearly demonstrated and presents a
useful human paradigm to study psychologic
stress (Hooper, Mathews, &amp; Witek-Janusek,
1997; Witek-Janusek &amp; Mathews, 1999b).
Anticipation of breast cancer diagnosis has
been shown to alter immune cell subsets
(Fillion, Lemyre, Mandeville, &amp; Piche, 1996)
and TH1 and TH2 cytokine production
(Witek-Janusek &amp; Mathews, 1999b). The effect
of stress on gene transcription factors
has been investigated in women undergoing
diagnostic breast biopsy. Gene transcription
factors play a significant role in the immune
response and can regulate the production
of cytokines (Wulczyn, Krappmann, &amp;
Scheidereit, 1996). In the diagnostic breast biopsy
paradigm, nuclear localization in lymphocytes
of two transcription factors, NF-kapB
and AP-1, was decreased in women experiencing
significant emotional stress,
whereas when stress was relieved (post-biopsy)
the nuclear localization of these gene
transcription factors was similar to those of
age-matched control women (Nagabhushan,
Mathews, &amp; Witek-Janusek, 2000). If and
how these factors relate to the modification of
immune function and to cancer outcome remain
to be determined, but such studies will
move this field to a molecular understanding
of the effects of stress.


Nurse researchers have used a psychoneuroimmunologic
approach toward understanding
the impact of childbirth and
postpartal stress on maternal child health.
Maureen Groer and her research team at the
University of Tennessee College of Nursing
have demonstrated that childbirth stress leads
to a reduction in maternal secretory immunoglobulin
A (sIgA). This reduction was most
pronounced in women who reported an increased
state of anxiety. Women with very
low or undetectable levels of sIgA had a
greater incidence of postpartal complications,
and their infants had more illnesses. These results
indicate that the stress of childbirth can
have profound effects on maternal immune
function, which can alter the clinical course of
mothers and that of their infants (Annie &amp;
Groer, 1991). Interestingly, Groer, Mozingo,
et al. (1994) demonstrated that touch, provided
by a 10-minute slow-stroke effleurage
back rub, was shown to increase sIgA levels in
elderly adults. It remains to be determined if
such an intervention may blunt the decrease in
sIgA observed during parturition. Other nurse
investigators have demonstrated that glucocorticoid
hormones can profoundly influence
the pattern of cytokine production (i.e.,
colony-stimulating factors) from neonatal
mononuclear cells obtained from umbilical
cord blood. Such immunomodulation may alter
the newborn's ability to resist infectious
pathogens (Witek-Janusek &amp; Mathews,
1999b).


The unique psychologic and immunologic
relationship between a breast-feeding
mother and her infant is an intriguing paradigm
in which to evaluate the stress-immune
relationship. Stress-induced alterations in maternal
immunity in breast-feeding mothers
could potentially alter their capability to provide
optimal levels of immunoglobulins for
their infants. Postpartal mothers of preterm infants
report high levels of mood disturbance
compared to the general population. Mothers
who score higher on negative mood subscales
of the Profile of Mood States produce less
milk sIgA than those who report lower negative
mood states. Conversely, mothers who report
higher vigor and anger produce greater
amounts of milk sIgA (Groer, Droppleman, &amp;
Mozingo, 1999). Interestingly, an inverse relationship
between cortisol levels and sIgA in
breast milk has been reported, such that the
higher milk cortisol was associated with lower
milk sIgA. It is plausible that increased maternal
stress leads to elevated plasma and milk
cortisol. Higher levels of milk cortisol may

<b>FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND
NURSING IMPLICATIONS</b>


The guiding premise of psychoneuroimmunology
is that stress-induced impairment
of immune function influences disease
progression or response to therapy or both.
These types of investigations are directed toward
an understanding of the effect of the
psychoendocrine stress response on the immune
system, particularly within the context
of cancer, autoimmune disease, infectious
disease, and maternal child health. Nurses
must recognize the potential effectiveness of
biobehavioral approaches to the care of patients
with immune-based disease. Such approaches
to stress management may not only
improve the quality of life and emotional
well-being of targeted populations but also
halt disease progression or complications
from opportunistic infection or both.


Complementary and alternative therapies
integrate preventive and curative therapies
that consider the whole person and are used to
"complement" traditional approaches to illness.
The use of complementary and alternative
therapies by American health care consumers
has markedly increased; rigorous
scientific testing of such practices has lagged
behind, however (Eisenberg et al., 1998;
Fontanarosa &amp; Lundberg, 1998). Increased
use of massage, touch, meditation, acupuncture,
yoga, botanical herbs, guided imagery,
and behavioral-based stress reduction programs
has spurred a renewed interest in understanding
the scientific basis for such approaches
toward healing and health maintenance.
This integrative biobehavioral, mind-body,
therapeutic approach is harmonious
with the view of psychoneuroimmunology
and that of nursing science.


As discussed previously, the links among
one's emotional state, neuroendocrine activity,
and immune response are well described.
Future emphasis needs to be placed on understanding
the mechanism(s) of stress-induced
immune dysregulation and the relationship
between stress-induced immune dysregulation
and health outcome. That is, do stress-induced
changes in immunity alter health,
and can stress-reducing interventions that
strengthen immunity halt disease progression
and improve health? These are critical questions
that require intensive empirical investigations
using human paradigms of stress.
Such approaches will lead to a better understanding
of disease and to better diagnosis,
treatment, or both of stress-induced immune
dysfunction. The results will provide the scientific
foundation that will lead to the identification
of individuals "at risk" for psychological
distress and altered immune reactivity.
Such identification will permit the development
of psychologically based interventions
designed to reduce stress, promote immunocompetence,
and hence improve health. Such
interventions may prove to be cost-effective
additions to traditional forms of treatment or
therapy or both and hold promise for disease
control. Ultimately, this will serve to enhance
the quality and the quantity of life.
