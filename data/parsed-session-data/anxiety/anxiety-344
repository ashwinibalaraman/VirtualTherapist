I waited another ten days, some of which were
pretty bad, but I crept along clinging to the
idea that hope was at least within hearsay.
Several times I swallowed my natural reticence
about pestering the office nurse and called to
tell her again that the doctor had said he would
not need to see me for long.


She was kind, but adamant—the schedule
was airtight thus far. She had my name down
and would keep in touch.


The next few days were a game of cat and
mouse with the doctor's staff. My reactions
ranged from hope and impatience to another
period of deep depression. I hoped that this
doctor was on the right track. After all, my
close friends and relatives, even my own good
sense, had pooh-poohed the idea that this was
a mental breakdown. I felt agitated and discouraged
that I must go on suffering just because
Dr. Van Tyl had no time to see me. It
seemed such a small thing to get the summary

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Did the doctor realize that I had been walking
the floor with nerves atingle, that it took
grit-toothed patience to endure my older son's
portable radio, blaring out its din of popular
music—popular with teen-agers at any rate!
My husband and I had discussed our younger
son's less-than-mediocre grades, and the eternal
matter of the family car with two youthful,
new license holders, and there had been a
semblance of a family conclave. At least this
gave me a feeling of being once more a working
member of the family, rather than a poor
creature to be pitied and endured by males
who tried to understand but who found my
inability to be jocose difficult going. <i>They</i>
found it difficult? <i>I</i> found it almost intolerable,
especially with the feeling that only a few
minutes with the right doctor might help me
back to health.


The days dragged by ... a week ...
another weekend. Suddenly I could stand it no
longer. I dreaded the professional tones of the
receptionist, but even if it meant being a nuisance,
there was a strange impulse to phone at
once. I had learned to listen to these inner
urges; I called them "guidance" and often

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Suddenly I felt deflated. "There isn't any
use," I told myself. "The office nurse must be
sick of the sound of my voice, and she promised
to call as soon as there was the slightest
leeway in the doctor's schedule."


My sense of immediacy would not be
denied. Nervously I dialed, my finger slipping
so that I had to hang up and try again. The line
was busy. "There," I told myself, "you weren't
supposed to call at all and this proves it."


But myself answered right back, "You mean
to say that you expected a man as busy as Dr.
Van Tyl wouldn't have a busy phone? Ring
again." This argument was beginning to be
wearing, so I dialed once more. This time the
office nurse sounded surprised. "How strange,
Mrs. Fraser. I was just noticing your name on
this list of patients waiting for a cancellation.
One came in a few minutes ago but I hadn't
had a chance to call anyone. There are a
number of people on the list, but ... well,
could you be in here at 3:30 this afternoon?"


Some might attribute my success to desperation
and persistence, or even to ESP. I prefer to
think that God is a God of mercy.


"Could I?" I fairly caroled to her. "I'd be
there if I had to crawl on my hands and knees
all the way downtown!"


She laughed at my obvious relief. "Well, 3:30
then. You might come in a little early. Goodbye

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I would have several hours to get ready; my
husband was out of town overnight, so I had
the car. I would take a tepid bath, prepare
slowly and carefully, and perhaps the beastly
hot flashes would leave me alone today. It was
cold—December—and if I weren't hurried or
late ... One of my worst sins, even when
well, was not allowing enough time and then
experiencing a last-minute panic.


"At least I know the office location," I
thought as I maneuvered my car along the
four-lane highway into the city. Marc's advice,
"Take a deep breath," came to me, and I tried
to inhale deeply as I drove past the lake with its
iceboats sailing like huge swans, taking advantage
of the strong winds. I began to feel
more light-hearted than in months.


Then trouble started. I had made excellent
time driving in from the suburb, but there was
not a parking space in sight. What a maze of
one-way streets and "no-left turns." By this
time I was beginning to perspire. Where were
all the outdoor parking lots? The ones I passed
had "SORRY, FULL" signs at the entrances.
What would I do? I found one several blocks
from the clinic, but no matter, I would have to
run. The wind whipped at my frame; I would
have a stiff neck tomorrow. Wind and I are old
enemies. But what matter whether my neck
would swivel after today? If I missed this appointment,

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>And what if I couldn't turn my neck? It would
be just as well</i>, I thought ruefully. I'd done too
much looking backward during this year. I
wondered if well people realized that every
moment seemed an hour to one depressed.


Yet when I was well the days were not long
enough for the things I wanted to accomplish.
My church, my family, and my many interests
encroached upon each other, vying for my
happy attention. How far away that phase of
life seemed now. And yet ... was it in sight
again? My hot flash subsided as I finally
reached the doctor's building, but I had to
mop my face as I waited for the elevator. I was
reminded of a friend, a bit older than I, who
went through menopause with her face
streaming wet most of the time. "How could
you stand dripping everywhere?" I asked in
wonderment and sympathy.


"Sarah, I made up my mind that I wouldn't
stay home and I definitely would not sop at my
face and neck constantly. I would be a new
style ‘drip.’"


Bravo for that type of pioneering courage. I
didn't have it. Oh, heavenly day, would the
elevator never come? I could be within
seconds of the appointment time if there
would ever be an "up" instead of a "down"
cage.


I arrived in the doctor's office three minutes

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Looking around the room, I found it much
larger than the previous office suite I had
visited. From the names on the door, I deduced
that Dr. Van Tyl had several partners. I
hoped that some of the numerous occupants
of the reception room were waiting to see the
other doctors, or had brought someone there.
Surely they could not all be patients.


They weren't. One anxious-appearing older
couple spoke quietly to a girl who came from
the inner hallway. "Did you have the brainwave
test?"


"Not yet," the attractive girl replied. Her
head was immobilized in a round collar of
metal and felt, indicating possibly a broken
neck. She walked up to the desk and spoke
quietly to the nurse who began to shuffle some
cards, saying, "Let's see, yours was accident,

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I tried not to stare. Had this girl been out
with a careless crowd of young people and
now would have her young life permanently
scarred because of a few unguarded moments?
Or had a drunken driver crossed her pathway?
The girl looked up, caught, and returned my
sympathetic smile. "I'm going to pray that her
brain isn't injured and that her neck will heal,"
I thought.


Idly I wondered if "hurry up and wait" was
still a key saying in the Armed Forces. The
minutes had stretched into an hour. It was a
good thing I was in a parking lot. My nerves
were misbehaving again. I had studied the
pleasant realistic pictures, the warm tones of
the walls—such a contrast to the gray surroundings
of the other psychiatrist.


As the waiting lengthened, I found myself
growing quite frightened as if this were the last
chance for me. If Dr. Van Tyl didn't help me,
what then? I reminded myself that the previous
doctor had said that medication would help,
that 1 need not be doomed to a life of one
extreme or the other, with the depressed times
increasingly long and the "up" times shorter
and more hectic. He had said that there were
combinations of drugs that would help me; a
doctor just had to find the right ones.


"Breathe deeply," I told myself. "I must go
into this interview with confidence and trust."

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tick, tick, tick. Had I been in Dr. Van Tyl's
office for hours or minutes? I began to fret that
I wouldn't see him in time to get my prescriptions
filled that same day. After a year of
misery, one would think another day wouldn't
matter, but it did ... dreadfully. If my suffering
could help someone else and be salvaged
as a useful experience, I felt I could bear it; still
I yearned to swallow the first medication that
very day.


"Mrs. Fraser, right this way. Doctor will see
you now." I hoped the nurse and the others in
the room hadn't noticed my nervous jump
halfway from the chair when my name was
called. Like a self-conscious child, I continued
to raise myself as if that were the way I always
got up from a chair.


I followed the nurse past a series of small
consulting rooms, going into the one she indicated
for me. More waiting. I ought to have
brought along a book; one always had to wait
in the inner office. I should have recalled this,
in view of the time I had spent thus in these
past months. If only it might be for some
positive results.


My natural interest in others asserted itself as
I studied the bookshelves crowded with medical
literature, the general aura of untidy busyness.
It was quite different from the pristine
quarters of the first psychiatrist. Papers and
files and folders were everywhere.


Presently a medium built, youngish man with

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was startled; his voice had sounded much
older over the phone. Oh, my, was he really
capable of understanding the subtle tortures of
a middle-aged female ... but he must be, to
have such a heavy case load.


He began to question me. Did this mean he
hadn't called the other psychiatrist for the
ten-minute briefing? It seemed he hadn't.
Well, here we go again. I must try to decide
again what are the highlights. Repetition
seemed so painful. He jotted down a few
things, nothing so complete as the other man's
notes. He was interrupted by a phone call and
reached for heavy dark-rimmed glasses as he
wrote down an address and date.


"That ought to be a good court fight," he
spoke into the phone. "Will you be there, too?
I'm not for committal myself."


Waiting, I felt grateful. This busy man, doing
so much good, cared enough for me as a
suffering human being to add me to his already
overtaxed schedule. My confidence in him
expanded. He could have his youthful look; he
needed it for his pace. Besides, if he helped
me, I hoped he'd live forever!


After another question or two, he wrote
down two prescriptions and handed them to
me as we both rose.


"Call me in ten days, after you've tried
these," he told me.

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt almost giddy with relief and expectancy.
I was on my way; I just knew it! Then
I glanced at the prescriptions. My heart sank
and my body followed suit in the chair I had
just vacated. My tones came from the depths of
disappointment.


"Dr. Van Tyl," I said in a shaking voice, "I've
a whole bottle full of this at home. It was
prescribed by a doctor in our former home
state. I quit taking it on my own, for it didn't
help at all. I've had the other too, some time
ago." My voice must have been dulled, distressed.
So quickly hope was gone; Dr. Van Tyl
had seemed my "last chance" apart from God's
sending a miraculous healing.


"Well," he said soothingly, "let's try them
together and see what happens. I'm afraid
you're a little impatient, Mrs. Fraser."


What a deep voice he had, reassuring, too.
"But doctor," I protested in self-defense. "It's
been such a long year."


"I know." Somehow i felt he really did. This
was rapport between physician and patient;
ages didn't matter after all.


"Sometimes we're lucky and get the right
combination at once. Sometimes it takes a little
patience; it's not easy to balance the body
chemistry."


"Not when it's misbehaved this long, I'm
sure. Thank you, doctor," and even I sensed
that my voice held hope again.


The improvement didn't come in a day, nor

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Our older son noticed a change. "Gee,
Dad," he told his father one night during the
third week, "Mother said, ‘Oh, <i>rapt</i>-yure,’ today.
You know the funny way she used to say it
when something pleased her a lot? I think she's
better."


"So do I, son," said his father happily.


I had come through the doorway in time to
hear the latter part of their conversation.
"Praise the Lord, I think so too," I exclaimed.


Through the ensuing weeks my biochemistry
did not continue to escalate. Not really. True, I
had made it from the basement to the first
floor, but there were several higher floors to
which I could not go. In a matter of months I
returned to the basement.


Had I been able to climb, this would have
been a much shorter book. I'm not sure that
anyone knew what had happened. There were
some personal worries and shocks, but I had
never had an easy life, and I thought I had
learned how to accept or to fight back, depending
on the urgency at hand.


It was almost impossible to reach Dr. Van
Tyl, though his nurse assured me that my name
was on a list for him to call at night from home.

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This was the period when I discarded my
name, Sarah, and said, "Just call me G. P.
Fraser."


"Ha! Guinea Pig," snorted my smart menfolk.
How right they were. Dr. Van Tyl and I
embarked on a series of medications by telephone
that is too unbelievable to record. Combinations,
new medications, an endless and
expensive array. Results? Negative. I might as
well have swallowed sodamint tablets.


One day after backing and filling in front of
the phone for over an hour, I finally made
myself dial Dr. Van Tyl's office. The nurse must
have sensed my desperation; she said sympathetically,
"Doctor's busy with a patient, Mrs.
Fraser, but hang on; I'll put you through to him
very soon."


Dr. Van Tyl's beautiful voice radiated good
cheer. "Mrs. Fraser, I was thinking of you
today. One of my patients, a professor at the
university, has been trying a new product. He
danced out of my office today with the remark
that he felt so great it almost frightened him.
Are you interested?"


"Not in the professor, but in his pills. Oh,

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048382-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hope may spring eternal, but mine had been
sprung so many times that I wondered if the
spring was sprung for keeps. Still
I was ready to try yet again. Tally-ho!
