BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Perfect.  More importantly, how are you?
<b>PT:</b>	I think I'm doing good.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm doing between okay and good.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	How's that?
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What, uh, I know last time we talked, it seemed like we had things kind of on track in terms of at least feeling pretty decent.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Any, any kind of down days yet that you get or—
<b>PT:</b>	Um, the most recent comes to mind here a couple of weeks ago, I went through about 3 panic attacks—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	In about a week and a half and that was, that was totally all work.  Um, came in one morning to find out my direct supervisor had cleaned out her office and resigned.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, really?
<b>PT:</b>	Then, [COUGHING], excuse me, like a week/week and a half later, came in the office to find out they fired the CFO the night before and she was gone, but then at the meeting that the CEO had with us at 8:30 that morning or at 9:00, there sits my direct supervisor at the meeting.  She's back, never to have resigned, a whole lot of miscommunication.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	So all of this occurred with those news in that setting?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Have things settled down at all?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Is your supervisor back?  Is that—
<b>PT:</b>	The direct supervisor is, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, of course, if related to her a lot better than the CFO.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I kind of was nervous around the CFO a little bit—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	You know.  Not used to sitting that close to the CFO, you know?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm used to that being a whole other building, top floor—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, the—
<b>DR:</b>	It's, it's, it's neat though that you're functioning at a level that you do have some of that interaction.  I mean that's, I think that's great.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But I understand why, nonetheless, the relationship with your supervisor could be a much more comfortable one.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and she's from one of my hometowns.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay, so this is really particularly good then—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	In terms of—yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And she just, she and I really relate.  She, she didn't start until like March.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Middle of March and she plugged for me all the way through.  You know, when she came on board and took the job as the new manager, the CFO asked her what she wanted, you know, what she needed—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And she said from the get go that she wanted me to be permanent fulltime.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	So, and I did get hired on full time at the end of June.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, oh, that's great.  That's great.
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	So that's good.  So that makes things a little more financially secure too.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I'm not so nervous, you know, about how long I'm going to be working there—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Kind of thing like I was when I was a temp.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	Have you, outside of those episodes, panic attacks, anxiety problems since then?
<b>PT:</b>	I had a couple of down days.  Um, I honestly don't remember when.  I remember calling the office about it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I honestly don't remember what it was about now, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Nothing that seemed like it, it stayed for more than a few days?
<b>PT:</b>	No more than a week for sure.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Don't remember any specific stressor at the time?  Because I don't think we, I mean I know you called, but I don't think we have that from the phone contact either.
<b>PT:</b>	I honestly can't remember.  I mean we've, we, I've had my share of things going on and stuff.  I mean we, we got some bad storm damage, had the basement flooded out.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you?  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Had like 8 inches of water.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you cleaned up at this point?  Are you—
<b>PT:</b>	For the most part, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I had a few things I had to throw out that I really didn't want to, you know?  Had a few tears.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But, you know, I'm getting over it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you able to have, are you, are you staying busy with the days with things you enjoy?  Things you look forward to doing?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I've been a couch potato a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It seems like I get, you know, by the time I get home, I've fallen asleep for the night at 7 o'clock a lot of times.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How often does that happen?
<b>PT:</b>	Quite often.  Um, or else I'm, I'll fall asleep and then I'll wake up an hour or 2 later and then I'll be up to 11 o'clock kind of thing.  Um—
<b>DR:</b>	So how do you sleep after that?  If you fall asleep at 7:00, how's the rest of your night go?
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah?
<b>PT:</b>	I wear my CPAP and—
<b>DR:</b>	I was going to say, you're still—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Religious about that?  Has, has that been checked recently?  How long's it been since—
<b>PT:</b>	Actually, it has.  [NAME OTHER] had to take it in for me the other day because we had like 3 power surges that we had for the—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Thing, and, and the cord fried.  So [NAME OTHER] took it in for me and they said everything was fine with that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	But I don't—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	See him, the doctor for that until December.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	That's my annual checkup.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  But that's good.  Sometimes people get off on those annual checkups and if one gets canceled or something, sometimes I've talked to people who gone through the year—
<b>PT:</b>	I know how long it takes to get to see him.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly, yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't cancel that unless I run into a snowstorm.
<b>DR:</b>	How, how about you and [NAME OTHER]?  How are you guys getting along?
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	There's absolutely no, nothing happening in the bedroom.  Absolutely nothing.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you guys talk about that?
<b>PT:</b>	I've talked to him until I'm blue in the face.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Just doesn't respond with any—
<b>PT:</b>	I, I finally, this is mean, but a couple of weeks ago, I finally told him, talked to him about it and said something to the tune, you know, I'm going to go find somebody who will, you know?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Kind of like go out and get a good time for an hour and come home again.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You thought about that?  Yeah, I've thought about it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Nothing said afterward.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, holy cow.  I'm only [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Is there, I mean what, what if you kind of up the anti in terms of saying what about, um, uh, about doing anything in terms of any kind of therapy specifically talking about that and—
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know if he would.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean I guess I might suggest that that's an even healthier way to, you know, kind of say and, you know, look, this is, you know, this is something that I need; it's something that's important to me—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And if we, you know, if we're not able to, to make this work for us here at home, let's talk to somebody.  You know, it, I mean I think the, the point would be that they can be, you know, a very focused kind of area to talk about.  So I don't think this is something that, you know, you have to say, you know, 2 years from now, we're going to be seeing somebody related to this.  Many people go to therapy with those kind of specific areas of concern and, you know, can, and I think sometimes it's that third person in the room that can really facilitate the, the conversation, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	That needs to take place and it sounds like he's not able to kind of engage enough in it to feel like you guys need to make progress.
<b>PT:</b>	He, when I said that to him a couple of weeks ago here, he, he said something that he just doesn't have the desire anymore.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Which is just something I hadn't heard from him.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, has he talked to his doctor about that?
<b>PT:</b>	He won't.  She knows about it 'cause I've talked to her about it and stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you know when he goes back next?
<b>PT:</b>	He usually has like an August/September/October yearly exam with her.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You know, I mean it might be worth either going with him if he's okay with that and just saying, you know, I do want to bring this up.  You know, letting him know in advance that, you know, you'd go because you do want to bring it up because it does, you know, there are medical causes for it if he hasn't had, uh, some of the tests done; if there are medicines that could be causing it; if it's, uh, you know, sometimes even things like testosterone levels can effect a guy's drive; um, and at the same time, if he, you know, if that doesn't really work out for you, you can always call the office and leave the information just saying I'd like to talk to, you know, uh, you know, whoever the physician's nurse is and just say I just want to tell you this because you don't need a release of information to give information—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But I think you can say, you know, look, this is, I just wanted you to know this is significant; I know it's been brought up before, but I don't think he's going to be the one to initiate it, um, but, you know, I'm wondering if there's, if there's, if, if she would be able to bring this up and, you know, think about what more might be done, um, and again, he might even, you know, I think, you know, saying would it be okay if I called and let them know or if I come, but, you know, I do want to do something about this and I think, you know, you're even more likely to get that healthier response of—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, kind of be on the shock value of, of what you said and kind of push him—
<b>PT:</b>	I think he would—
<b>DR:</b>	Into what would we do, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	One thing that he's brought up to me before is that 'cause of all the FMLA time I've had in the past—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	That he feels like I'm not pulling my own weight with finances—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And he feels stressed out because he feels like he has to be the only one.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Now what does that have to do with the other?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, and that's where I think if kind of his family doctor checks things out and everything else is otherwise normal from a most general medical perspective, then you do get in that point of saying, hey, look, you know, talking to somebody about this and helping kind of sort out where those emotions are, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And, and how they impact intimacy is—
<b>PT:</b>	And he, it would piss him off if I took time off work to go with him to the doctor.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, then—
<b>PT:</b>	Then I think it would talk.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, and I think he's right.  Either whether it's that way, and I think again, the conversation of your end can be look, I, I feel like we do need to do something about this.  If you're telling me the desire, the desire and dr, drive's not there, then what are going to do about it and, you know, include him as an active participate in the discussion, but, you know, I think the, the, you know, on your part the, the fairness being that what, what, you know, really is unacceptable to me in so many terms that we just don't do anything more about this, um, and, and I think that's, you know, that's a fair position for a spouse to take is, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm not asking for you to come up with a solution tonight, but I am asking that you care enough, um, that you help figure out, um, where we might find one and, and I think that beyond kind of that sense of, you know, if you don't, somebody else will, uh, which again I appreciate gets his attention, but doesn't get you anywhere further in terms of probably a very healthy emotional response on his part—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And, uh, yeah, or for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, um, you know, I do think, like you said, I do think that, that trying to fix those sleep habits of going to bed that early, typically that much sleep that gets more fatigue, not a greater sense of restfulness and try to get into that routine, I'm just saying when you're, you kind of get that initial urge of hey, I'm, I'm tired, I could do this, what, you know, what can I do to keep myself just a little bit more active?
<b>PT:</b>	I had my, uh, my 3 month checkup for my diabetes.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes, I, I think that was coming the last time we talked.
<b>PT:</b>	With, uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and I asked her, I said is there some kind of a better vitamin I could be taking or something?  I said, I just get tired all the time.  I don't have any desire to do anything and, and she really didn't, she said something about the one a day vitamins and that's what I take now.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you ever, have you, uh, ever taken the, the medicine Provigil?
<b>PT:</b>	Never heard of it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's nothing that we've ever prescribed here.  Um, it's an interesting medicine.  It's been out for a number of years.  Uh, it has been used, it's FDA indication is really for fatigue associated with a couple of different things, either with people that work with shift—work situations, you know, they're working through the night, but the other indication is people that have sleep apnea and have a lot of residual fatigue.  You know, the, the treatment works, it helps, but there's still just, their energy isn't significantly improved.  Um, it's not prescribed sometimes by a lot of clinicians because it's expensive and plans lots of times won't approve them unless you specifically have one of those conditions, but you do.  And it's interesting, there's been a little bit of secondary research that's been done when they look at it in terms of, you know, how it might impact mood, um, it's medicine, it helps concentration and focus probably in  higher dosages it may be something that, you know, uh, would be effective for even, you know, adults, children with ADHD, uh, that that's been talked about.  There's a little bit that's written about it.  None of this is FDA, you know, indication stuff, but the, but the energy and sleep part is and, uh, I think that that would be an appropriate medicine for you.  Um, I think that it would do a couple of things.  I think that hopefully we'd see some greater consistency in energy level for you and I think that that would have a lot of secondary benefits in terms of mood or those, you know, and, and—
<b>PT:</b>	Being able to do stuff—
<b>DR:</b>	Hopefully—
<b>PT:</b>	At night.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  What fuels that cycle—
<b>PT:</b>	Exercise.
<b>DR:</b>	Of feeling better.  Uh, I think it's appropriate.  It's a very well tolerated medicine.  It's a once—a—day medicine.  You take it in the morning.  It's a controlled medicine meaning that it has abuse potential.  I've not ever seen anybody that's abused it and it's not addictive or habit forming in that you can stop it abruptly and there's no withdraw, uh, and, uh, it's, you know, and it's something that again I've, I've taken people off [INAUDIBLE].  It's, it's in the stimulant class, um, you know, uh, it's not the same level of Ritalin, uh, but it's, it's similar—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But again even Ritalin for people, we've treated people with, uh, difficulty with energy level whether it's multiple sclerosis or sleep apnea with that.  The Provigil is a little nicer in that it's, it's, it's one of the, uh, longer acting products, um, in terms of en, and, you know, rarely do we see somebody with any insomnia with it.  Um, mild upset stomach, mild headache, little bit of potential for dry mouth, um, but it's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	How expensive is it?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it, it should be on your plan.  It's expensive if your plan doesn't cover it.  It will be a branded co—payment on your plan, um, and they don't sample it, um, but, uh, do you know what you, do you have a 3—tier plan?  Do you pay for generic brand and then kind of specialty branded—
<b>PT:</b>	I think so.
<b>DR:</b>	It, it wouldn't surprise me if it's a third tier on your plan, whatever that is.  Uh—
<b>PT:</b>	Would it be through the mail order program?
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, I wouldn't have any reason to expect that we couldn't get it through the mail order program.  You know, I guess it's kind of up to you in terms of how you'd like to start it.  I, uh, sometimes I don't—
<b>PT:</b>	I wouldn't want to do it through mail order right away.
<b>DR:</b>	Usually I do the first month for a couple of reasons.  First of all, you are going to pay more for that if you don't end up staying on it.  You're kind of heeding your bets on that, but at the same time, it's a lot of medicine if it's not something that's, that's right for you whether it's a side effect issue or it's just not a benefit.  Um, so I might suggest that we start getting it locally first.  It may be that even with the prescription that when you take it to the store, they still phone us back and we have to call through your plan to get an authorization for it, but you have an indication for it.  So it would just be a matter of  dotting our I's and crossing our T's for that and I think we'd get there.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I guess my feeling is, is that if it's in a range where what it would particularly if we could get it through mail order that it's doable financially, uh, I, you know, the, the nice thing is that this doesn't take a long time to figure out, you know, and, uh, so it's not something that we'd be doing over the long term unless we really felt like it was something that you'd see, see a pronounced difference, but it is very different than anything else we've done before and I think it has more potential kind of yield in that respect.  Um, should we give it a try?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Like I said, if you end up at the pharmacy and it's something that we don't anticipate with your plan, uh, then, I, we've got, we've got other options in this area.  I just, I think it's the better option for today it seems.  Like I said, I think the medicine, and the sleep centers use it a lot too.  They'll be very, by the time you follow up with them, they'll be very familiar with what we're doing and what we're doing it.  I, like I said, I think the nice thing is secondarily from a mental health perspective, we see a lot of people with, uh, uh, depression that there's a lot of overlap between that—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And residual symptoms of sleep apnea and, and I think that it's—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, phys, physically I'm on, that's the okay level that I'm at right now I think.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, my feet have been swelling up for about 2 months now and, uh, they, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] started me on a water pill.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Hydrochlorothiazide?  Is it HCTZ?
<b>PT:</b>	That sounds right.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you know how many milligrams?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  I didn't know you were going to ask me that.
<b>DR:</b>	It's all right.  Did you start anything new, else new medicine wise?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, no, everything's the same.  Um, I had some, had some knee problem for a couple of months and I saw a doctor in urgent care for that.  So it's kind of been hard to do exercising and stuff.  By about noon, my ankles are just—
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and it starts to hurt actually, kind of an ache and that.
<b>DR:</b>	Have they talked about having you do anything more like on a recumbent bike or anything like that to get some—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, no.  She didn't say anything.  Um, maybe actually when we got our stimulus check—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Went out and bought a Wii—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And the Wii fit board.
<b>DR:</b>	That's what I was going to say is, you know what, you're probably the third or fourth person that's told me that they done that.
<b>PT:</b>	We just started getting it hooked up.  I went over to my best friend's house Sunday and she showed me how to get it set up and stuff.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	I've heard really good things about that.
<b>PT:</b>	So I figure, you know, the only thing I've done so far is hoola hoop and watch [NAME OTHER] try to do the ski slope thing where you come down and then you're in midair and—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	It's quite the balance thing.  I mean just to get balanced right, I can, I can feel it, you know?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, and I think that the benefit to that is like there's a lot of, uh, work with kind of core muscles in doing that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So I think that there's something for that too.
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	I would suggest, let's get this started.  I want to see you back in 6 weeks with this new medicine.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	If there's any problems with it, you call me.  Um, the, um, let's not change the other.  I think your, because you're mail order, I think you're okay right now with your, uh, the Lexapro—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And the Ambien—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, and I won't change dosage of those.  Uh, I think that the, uh, let's keep those where they are.  Let's, let's add this in here and see if we can't, uh, see the nice thing is this stuff works pretty quick.  I expect the day you take it, that you can see some benefit with it.  I think the secondary benefits will still play out over the, the next few weeks, um, and it's half a dose, 100 mg for the, the first week and then we'll go to 200 mg.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay?  Take it to the pharmacy when you get a chance though 'cause like I said, if they, I've got the code on there that you should need for them to know why we're doing it and hopefully get through the authorization, but that doesn't mean they won't push back with us.  I think last time I wrote for this, the company sent me back a form with 48 questions on it to answer.  Uh, they were all yes/no questions, but, uh, sometimes they make us work for it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But I think we'll get it and like I said, if we don't, we've got products similar but different that, uh, I don't think we're stuck that we can't still go in this direction of things.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay?  But let's see if we can't help you keep up in the evening and get on the Wii fit.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All right?
<b>PT:</b>	Sounds good.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	On a side note, did you hear this morning?
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] got traded to the Jets.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes, that, I forgot that, yes.
<b>PT:</b>	I, I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, oh, do you think they should have let him come back?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But, you know, it doesn't even feel right anymore with all the hassle.
<b>DR:</b>	I know and that's why you'll understand that it does seem like this answer that they gave [INAUDIBLE] you know what, we're, we've done kind of irreparable damage with all of us at this point, it would be hard to make it work.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?  I don't know.  I kind of thought it would be fun if he went to the Bears, but I suspect you don't feel that way?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	That would have really cracked me up.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	The Bears or the Vikings either way.
<b>PT:</b>	To the Bears, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Really the Jets?  Well, that's interesting.  I did not hear that.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I thought if they were talking about Tampa Bay yesterday.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, exactly, that's what I thought too.  Well, the Jets is a little more exciting.  They need a quarterback.  Are you guys going to go to the game this year?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, they were going to go to the Colt game.  I don't know—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	That'd be great.
<b>DR:</b>	A while.
<b>PT:</b>	'Cause I love [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But they only have 4 tickets for that and there's not near the crowd going.  There's only like 5 people going—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So I bailed out so [NAME OTHER] and I could do like a long week vacation—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Or something.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, oh, that's nice.
<b>PT:</b>	Now if he would have went to the Vikings, maybe I would have tried to get a Vikings ticket, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	That's almost forbidden territory [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I was going to say, that's rough, yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	Good to see you.  Call me if there's any problems.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
