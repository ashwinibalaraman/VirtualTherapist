MY MOTHER HELPED me find digs in the home of artist friends,
in a charming house just off the Brompton Road. I was given a
small room on the top floor. My glowing hat, on the washstand,
symbolised clearly the difference between two worlds, the one in
the near past, the other which I was about to enter. Some part
of me, defensively, clung to the glamorous hat, the other real part
demanded acceptance at the art school as a serious student and
not as a dilettante.


London was bursting into spring, mischief was all around me,
but still I had no share in it. That first term was a difficult one.
I was still very shy, unsure of myself, and I stammered. Besides
this, I had only my army uniform (I was not demobilised yet)
and a pair of riding breeches. So that my appearance alternated
between a potentially dashing young Guards toff and a young
dark-haired edition of Munnings. The looks which I received did
nothing to increase my confidence and I suspect that even my
stammer was assumed to be a 'social status symbol'. I longed to be
accepted; for here at last in the long narrow locker-filled corridor,
nicely stained in paint, was the world I understood and loved. The
studios overawed me when filled with students, who all appeared
far more talented than I was, sure of themselves, knowing where
they were heading. I longed to possess their nonchalance, their
easy ways in the canteen and their laughter. Those first few weeks
were truly unhappy ones. I felt isolated, unwanted and incompetent.
Probably to an outsider I appeared brash and pushing.
This was merely a disguise to hide my unsureness.


I liked to potter about the empty studios, which reflected my
sadness to perfection. It was almost an act of masochism. In those
large rooms, so suddenly stripped of their vitality and use, I found
another form of loneliness which I could add to my own. It was

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had submitted a painting of a street in Ben√¥det, done during
the holidays in Britanny, to the annual sketch club. I remember
joining the rest of the school for the 'crit' which was to be given
by the Principal, Harold Williamson, in the gymasium where the
works were hung. I wedged myself into the back of the hall as
inconspicuously as possible. The Principal talked for some minutes
and finished his introduction by saying that there were five
paintings which he particularly liked, for entirely different reasons.
He talked about four of them and then quite suddenly mentioned
mine as the fifth, and as prizewinner. He explained for some
minutes why he found my painting interesting, where its faults
lay and what pleased him about it. I was flushed with excitement.
Nothing will ever obliterate the memory of the joyous swing
which my pendulum took during those few minutes. The room
danced around me and the pictures became blurred rectangles of
pure colour and delight. The faces around me dissolved into dots
and dashes and the Principal became a thin perpendicular streak
silhouetted against a blurred host of coloured rectangles. I remember
only hazily leaving the hall afterwards and the many
congratulations from unknown students. That moment was my
ticket into the art school as a serious student. I have of course a
most affectionate regard for that painting and have always refused
to sell it. It now hangs in the hall of my father's house, not because
it is a very good painting, but because its success meant so
much to me at that time.


From that moment onwards I was back in the world of reality,
laughter and light. It led to four years of much happiness, in
which I squandered my talents in the usual boisterous ways

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I remember my world, at the start of art school, as still divided.
Part of me was immersed in the bohemian pleasures of student
life, part of me still clung to the upper-middle-class security of
my parents' world. My mother's flat, sophisticated and ordered,
contrasted strongly with the rooms and houses of my student
friends. Lacking full security myself, often I found myself retreating
to her world of Adam fireplaces. But I was aware that in
these surroundings, so free of creative problems, lay a trap. I had
no wish to touch and handle the well arranged objects in my
mother's flat; I merely wanted their security and approval. Paradoxically
my behaviour, when I did visit this flat, was often
aggressive and out of tune with the surroundings. For the real
and tactile artist in me pined for a room where created things
grew. Despite the squalor of many of my friends' rooms, I
found in them the quality which was most needed by me at that
time.


Soon I moved into a world which was nicely situated between
the two. A large and handsome studio, close to the art school,
was owned by one of the senior students. Felicity welcomed me
into her fascinating circle of friends, and to a room which I loved
from the first moment I saw it. Here, in Felicity's Glebe Place
studio, where art was synonymous with breathing I met a host
of interesting people. Looking back over the years, I see a studio
full of dearly loved books, pictures and objects, arranged with
rare judgement, creating an eternally peaceful world. It was a
world poised somewhere between Tissot and Bonnard. Here I
first experienced 'itchy' fingers, and the passionate desire to live
in such a room myself. So I collected round me objects which
were close cousins to those in Glebe Place, and decorated my own
first real home, a two-room unfurnished flat in Oakley Gardens.
This studio flat arranged itself in much the same pattern as my
Greek room in the Mess in Salonika, only now there were no

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Settled in my new studio, many of the past sensations surfaced
again. I began to draw with some of the passioned fury of Salonikan
days, unleashing rhythms and ideas which hammered continuously
for release. At art school it was not possible to work in
this abandoned way. I was ashamed to draw in this fiery impetuous
manner. Guilt still lay within me, and subconsciously I
connected this emotional way of drawing with sin, and ultimately
with collapse and total darkness. I would look at the few remaining
drawings from Greek days, realise the cost, and resolve not
to express myself in this way again. It was probably wise at
the time. My mind still needed rest and could not afford a torrent
of ideas to flood it. Even now I have to ration my painting, for
I know there is a danger point which can only lead to the uncontrolled
swing of the pendulum. I work these days with more
caution than I would have guessed possible a few years ago, at full
tilt for a while, but with a keen ear for the shrill scream of the
pendulum.


Not that I feared a return of my illness; that did not occur to
me. The very name of the illness, manic-depression, had not once
been mentioned to me. I heard mention of the word schizophrenia,
hushed somewhere during my illness. But once I was
free of hospitals, my illness was immediately relegated to the
'breakdown file', certainly by my family, and consequently by
myself. Therefore I was not aware of what had really 'possessed'
me, not did I sense any dangers for the future. I had had a bad
breakdown, My father, I think, realised some of the potentials
which might lead to a further illness. Often he has tried to persuade
me not to get bogged down in the pattern of thought and
reading which interests me most, and which he thought led to
my troubles in Greece. But of course, despite the well-meaning
intent of his advice, I have never, for long, been able to accept
it. For my life and creative work are bound up with these matters,
matters that I do not fully comprehend, but which I realise

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But at Chelsea, I played safe with that part of my life which was
fraught with danger. This was mainly a subconscious reaction, not
one born of considered thought. And 'Spring had such mischief
in me' that much of my time was spent in explosive student rags.
But there were times when the pendulum did swing more fully.
I remember my first meeting with Soutine. Purposely I say with
Soutine, rather than with his painting, for at first glance I met a
kindred spirit who had done in his painting what I most wished to
do. Looking at his magnificent crimson-cassocked, white-surpliced,
standing choirboy, I rose with him in prayer right into
the gaping heavens. There was in Soutine's work the ecstasy
and anguish which I understood so well. I hungrily purchased a
book on this master of deeply emotional poetic painting. He
showed clearly the close link which ecstasy possesses with
anguish; without reading his biography I knew the torments
he must have suffered, and the heights he must have reached.
I realised fully the reason for his death, at an early age, of
ulceration, barnacles born of spiritual passions exceeding
the endurances of man. These paintings fired me to work
again.


I took wing on many an occasion into the visionary clouds and
blossoms of Samuel Palmer. And I met Bomberg in full force
at the Redfern Gallery. At that time he was mostly neglected; it
is only in recent years that the London art world has woken to
his vital powers. But I remember well my admiration and respect
for his work, which cast an even gloomier spell upon the already
misted ambiguities of the Euston school, who reigned triumphant
during the late forties. I felt anger at his neglect and could not
comprehend a world of art which put faded post-Sickertian

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was engaged on many fronts during those years, but none
was more important to me than the search for paintings that
spoke to me. Chardin spoke of perfection, peace and mysticism;
Kandinsky of vital rhythms and a divine ecstasy; of the ecstasy
and anguish I knew so well. Van Gogh and Kokoschka spelt the
full force and vitality of man, though Kokoschka's force never
burnt as deeply into my mind as Van Gogh's; this great Dutchborn
painter meant for me certainty and positivity, and compassionate
perception. And the poetic three words, Piero della
Francesca, whispered a magic, mystic stillness which man has
rarely equalled in the field of painting.


I realise now, after many years involved with paintings, that
I never see the literary content of a picture at the first glance. It
is the abstract essence which strikes me, and it is by this quality
that I judge it. Slowly the realism dawns upon me, but the true
'reality' for me always lies in the abstract content.


I had not analysed this 'inner understanding' of a painting
during student days. But I do remember, in recollection, that I
was deeply thrilled by the baroquely voluptuous masterpiece of
Rubens, 'The Rape of the Sabines', at the National Gallery, and
yet until my third meeting with it had no real awareness of its
subject matter. I thought of it as a joyously sensuous mass of
movement; later I saw the infinite subtleties of the flesh painting;
but it was some years before the words of my composition tutor
at Chelsea, the distinguished painter Robert Medley, who referred
to the 'mystical worldliness and delight' of Rubens really
fell into place. During those student years, it was the 'glow' which

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I mention this, at this juncture, because it is vitally important
to the problem of the pendulum. Objects, during the 'imprisoned'
world of the Grecian days, had taken on another form; I had become
part of them, comprehending their abstract content--by
which I mean their non-occupational task. In that cookhouse I
had first sensed the peace and exactitude of Chardin's world, in
cups and saucers. Later, as I have recorded, many objects became
linked to me in more fiery challenge. And so it was with paintings.
And that is why I accept and enjoy so much of abstract
painting, although I am myself what is called, for want of a better
name, a representational painter. To judge a painting by its realistic
content is to miss the point of art. That the details and story
within a picture add to it, I do not deny, if they are sublimated to
the original abstract conception. Any work of art of distinction is
first and foremost abstract. That I did not fully comprehend this
during my student days is not surprising; but within me I held
the intuitive understanding of this important matter.


The years can easily glaze the past in nostalgic memories. I
have no nostalgia at all for my student days. I could write of
Renoiresque summer outings on the Thames, when students and
staff mixed cricket with beer. Or of the 'Stunt', the end of the
Christmas Term variety show, which the students staged, and
which meant so much to me at the time. Or of the film called
'The Lost Chord' which I made with a handful of other students
on the Berkshire Downs. But none of these events really looms
large in my memory and certainly had no profound effect upon
the pendulum. The joys experienced in these various activities
were normal and fully happy ones, but without intensity.


But there was some intensity in my feelings for the autumn
and winter evenings which are an inseparable part of the magic
of London, if one loves that city at all. My memories of those
foggy evenings, with the lights faintly peering through them, are

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The self-indulgent, monastic world of art school passed and I
had no regrets as I brushed down the visitors to the public
lavatory at the Festival Gardens, during the last summer vacation.
I enjoyed immensely that temporary job and gained some of the
best tips on dogs and horses that I have ever had, besides the usual
ones accorded to such a post.


When the vacation was over I went out to teach. I could not
find myself a post in an art school, much to my disappointment,
but took up one in the West Country in a small public school. I
had determined to live in the country once I had finished studying,
for I was more than anything interested in landscape. Also, my
legs were ulcering badly and I knew that the country would
afford me a more restful time, the queueing for buses and trains
being a continuous strain on my health during student years.


I found, near Taunton, a small public school which might have
come straight out of the <i>Bumper Boys' Annual</i>. But my heart leapt
with joy to be deeply in the country once more and I sensed, at
first meeting, that Somerset had something very special to offer

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I remember many scenes from that happy term. But only one
or two are relevant to this story. I recall with great joy a scene in
a dormitory. A master, short in stature but with a huge moustache,
and puffing an even vaster pipe, is on 'dorm duty'. A tall
boy comes up to this little Napoleon and, towering above him,
puffs at the infernal clouds of smoke. The master staggers back,
unbelieving. "How dare you--how DARE YOU ... blow away
... blow away--my smoke." My pendulum, in sheer delight,
responded strongly to that moment of supreme pomposity and
I barely concealed my laughter. Perhaps that incident encouraged
my ambition to get out of schoolmastering, and fired me with
even more zeal for my creative work.


The world of dog-eared books, mortar boards, tired desks, and
crisply functional matrons did beckon. It possessed calm permanence,
upon which you could rest and rust away, very easily. But
in its midst there were sudden glimpses of other matters. The
blackboard streaked with signs and symbols which faced one
entering a classroom: a master had left something more than just
a white algebraic equation chalked upon a board, some essential
and vital part of him was inscribed upon that flat dark enigmatic
surface. And the pendulum leapt a little at those newly discovered
and disturbing signs; the writing was, if not literally upon the
wall, at any rate upon the board.


And in that remote negative world of quadrangles and equations,
silver cups and gowns, fired by the full enjoyment in my
task of teaching, infected with the golden glow of autumn, my
mind chalk-streaked by fluent signs and symbols, I tackled with
football fury my first white canvasses since leaving art school. I
worked long hours into the night, in my small attic studio,
covering vast canvasses which almost exploded from the room.


Many 'indoor fireworks' were produced during that term of
work, none more important, to my career as a whole, than the
vast backcloth for the end of term school play. This I stretched

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But more important, to my story, are the scars which that
activity left upon my aching legs. It was a foolhardy act to work
for such long hours, on that concrete base, with legs already ulcering
so fiercely. No sooner was term finished and I had returned
to London, than my temperature rose. The ulcers had gone septic.
My mother gave me hospitality at her flat and there I started a
batch of fierce drawings whilst confined to bed. I drew mostly
my sheets and pillows, desperately trying to drag from them some
message of comfort. The anguish at once again being confined to
bed, just when life had seemed so brimful of hope, burst forth
from me and I scrawled a hundred signs and symbols on drawing
paper, expressing my state of mind. My bed sheets became high,
voluptuously sensual seas, the pillows defiant rocks, and objects
around the room were stranded voyagers cringing from the
wreck. And so I drew, with the impassioned force of Grecian
days, until my mind whirled into the same pools, which beckoned
my drowning state. My mind began to boil again, once confined
to bed, so that I lived much of that time in a world of images,
signs and symbols which were scored into the subconscious by
white-hot needles. For a short time I experienced that 'separation
from the body' so relevant to this state, where the outside and
practical world does not exist. But I was reminded of it by the

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I shall be writing more fully in the next chapter of many events,
directly linked with the vicious swinging of the pendulum, during
'confinements', periods of enforced hospital treatment for my
legs. I purposely use the word 'confinement', for a person of my
vitality, exuberance and wide interests, experiences just this
pregnant state when cooped up in bed. Ideas and images generate
to profusion in this physically static state, and the urge to give
birth to them shares some of the same pains as actual childbirth.
And the pendulum swings with desperate force at times.


My removal to hospital for further treatment, and the first of
several operations to aid the circulation in my legs, early in the
New Year, affected me in several ways. Much of my anguish was
assuaged by the quiet rhythm of the medical ward in which first
I rested, before being moved to the surgical one. The drawings
of that period reflect that calm and order. The pain, too, kept my
spirits from too high a flight. And as in other long periods in
hospital, I read widely. Those three months were a university
term of learning. My companions, most far iller than myself, and
the staff, were in a way my tutors, for I learnt from and through
them many of the wisdoms which few university dons can impart.


I have often said, and how I mean it, that it's an ill wind that
blows nobody no good. All experience is of value, if we allow it
to be. But I had not that wisdom during my first sojourn at
Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton. Much of me was bitter,
self-pitying and childish. I felt myself to be back in square one,
the black rectangle.
