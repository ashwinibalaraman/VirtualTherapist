BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Here we go.
CLIENT: Doesn't it tilt to match where you are?
THERAPIST: Yeah, exactly. It's flat now so I guess I had it the other way around, down. But we overcome it.
CLIENT: (chuckles) So, yeah I'm not, well first of all I have no idea whether I was right in thinking that you do know what to do. Yeah. I kind of thought about that a little bit and I was like yeah, it could be, I have no idea. Yeah I think there was a kind of, you know you seemed surprised on Monday. [0:01:05]
And that like, you know I feel like I've been kind of doing better and then suddenly I'm really not doing well and it seems like, ok what's going on here? But you didn't have an immediate like response. You just didn't talk very much. And (pause) I felt like on Monday night when you talked about my being afraid that I will get better as well as being afraid that I won't, and I think that's really true. And I think that it's, we're kind of at the point where we need to talk about that. But I'm not sure that was exactly what was relevant then. [0:01:52]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So I felt like you were kind of like, "Ok, well here's what I've got." That kind of thing.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Rather than like here's what I think...
THERAPIST: Here's what I know, maybe I should of thought of that but.. (chuckles)
CLIENT: Kind of like "Here's what I think from the larger picture" rather than here's what's going on right now.
THERAPIST: I see. Gotcha.
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. (pause) And I don't know. I just think it's just what I do. I watch people closely and I draw conclusions about where they are and sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong. So. (chuckles)You don't have to tell me whether they're right or wrong. Like I actually am fairly neutral in my desire to know or not. Like whatever. Tough, you know. You'll tell me if you want to when you want to tell it, so. (chuckles) [0:03:03]
THERAPIST: (chuckles) I think that may be making you anxious, I think. (chuckles)
CLIENT: Sort of. But it's kind of you know, a larger anxiety of like this relationship that I, that I don't see as being that important. (laughs)
THERAPIST: What anxiety is that?
CLIENT: Well that it's so one sided that it is, you know, pretty much, that it is just entirely directed towards me like that makes me anxious and I don't like that. [0:03:52]
THERAPIST: Oh ok. I was referring to something else. I mean, that maybe much more relevant what you're saying now. What I was thinking about was, (pause) you seem a little concerned about sort of positing that I didn't know what was going on or that you had sort of drawn this, or had made this inference about me. Like you seemed really slightly worried that I put pressure to confirm or deny that you're sort of worried or wary of like kind of pushing on me or making an assumption like that. Which I guess seemed to me to tie into some of the stuff we had been talking about to do with worries about, sort of like, we have to (inaudible at [0:05:06]) taking up emotional space in a way, or whatever you want to call it. [0:05:10]
But maybe that's, that's what I was, that's what I was reading into what you were, what you were doing this time.
CLIENT: No I'm not, I mean that's true also. But I think that's really connected with being anxious about the kind of one sidedness of the therapeutic relationship. I don't know. It came up with Dr. Vaughn a couple of weeks ago. And she had a very, you know her style is very different from yours. And she just, and she talks a lot. (laughs) And just had a really nice like thing. You know this, like this is designed for you as a patient to be able to kind of not, there are no expectations placed on you. That's not actually really at all what she said, I don't know. But it was very helpful. And, (pause) yeah I guess I just, I don't know. It makes me anxious in that I really don't want to push you. I really, really don't. (pause) But I also, I think one sided relationships are fiction. [0:07:03]
And (pause)I had this worked out to say and now it's gone. (pause)That,(pause) you know what I mean, you know as far as I can see the best way I can take care of you is to let you do your job. But I don't really know what that is. (chuckles) Because I feel like, you know, what you say, you know, I basically just say whatever I think. What you say to me is clearly not whatever you think. (chuckles) [0:08:09]
And I'm ok with that but it also makes me really uncomfortable in some ways. It, yeah, it just kind of, I have to keep reminding myself that I'm ok with it. If that makes sense.
THERAPIST: What's uncomfortable about it?
CLIENT: (pause) I guess I, part of it is that I always feel like the more I know about what a person's thinking, the better I can work with them, you know the better I can, (pause) the better I can take care of them. Part of it is my being uncomfortable with, you know I feel like I should just be able to look up everything or you know learn all the information and then everything should be fine. (chuckles) [0:09:29]
THERAPIST: (chuckles) Did I give you the book with the ending in it?
CLIENT: Yeah, so I, so the idea that this is like a process is, you know a process, and an emotional one where like, like I recognize in other people. I will draw conclusions about them and then say, "Ok, they are not ready for me to tell them this. This is not a good, I can't tell Kirsten that she needs to..." I don't know. See a therapist about her anxiety. I did tell her that. (chuckle) Like, "This is fixable, I promise. Anxiety is good to have because there's all these really good techniques that like actually work" (chuckles) But you know I can't tell her that she's needy. (pause) [0:10:38]
You know I can't tell Dan that he's in love with me in part because he's looking for somebody to be in love with.
THERAPIST: Are there things you know of and can't tell me?
CLIENT: About you or in?
THERAPIST: I mean about this. Whatever.
CLIENT: Probably. But not many. You know, once I start talking I usually end up just saying everything I said I was, thought I wasn't going to say anyway. So (chuckles) I'm not really good at being discreet. (chuckles) [0:11:32]
So last night I, yesterday was a really good day. Good, bad. I worked like actually eight hours which is very well and a long time. But I just kind of, it was like, "Ok, I'm going to finish this memo and send it off and then I'll go home." And you know started, and it was seven in the evening. And I was like, "Oh, it's still light outside and I've been sitting here for five hours and ok, that sounds good." So I like, I had a bottle of wine. Or part of a bottle of wine, watched "Batman Begins" again. And I was, but and I was kind of tipsy and then I was like, "Oh my God. What if I ran into Chad when I was drunk?" And then I was like, "That can never happen." (chuckles) What if you weren't? If I have (inaudible at [0:12:37]) I am going to flee.
THERAPIST: Ok, noted. How come?
CLIENT: (pause) Mainly because when I'm drunk, people that I like at all, I like a lot more. (chuckles) That would just be bad.
THERAPIST: Is that right?
CLIENT: See that is something that I was not going to tell you and then did. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Are you worried about liking me a lot more? [0:13:33]
CLIENT: Yes. (pause) Not immoderately so.
THERAPIST: On the worry or the liking?
CLIENT: On the worry. (chuckles) And the liking. (pause) Yeah, it's just, it's important to me to respect boundaries in this relationship.
THERAPIST: Which ones do you have in mind? [0:14:21]
CLIENT: It's the fact that like I'm never really going to be your friend, which is sad.
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: But it's ok. (pause) You know and then there's like I really do fall in love with everybody. So there's that. But that's actually not that big of a deal, I promise. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Why are you reassuring me about that? (chuckles) What are you are you reassuring me about?
CLIENT: (chuckles) It freaked me out.
THERAPIST: Oh, ok.
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. [0:15:33]
THERAPIST: So are you worried that either your feelings for me or feelings that they arouse in me will like get in the way of the therapy relationship or will cross a boundary in some way or something like that?
CLIENT: I'm really not worried about it in the context of therapy. I'm really worried that I will run into you at a party. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Oh, ok. Gotcha. (chuckles)
CLIENT: That's all. Yeah. You know like I, (pause) I had a really good thing in Dan and I lost it. Because neither of us respected boundaries. [0:16:35]
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: (pause) You know and I can't really talk about it with people that I don't know well. And I can't really go back to another game. And (pause) I don't know maybe there's a place for me to be friends with him down the road but I kind of doubt it.
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: And even if there is, I'm never going to be able to talk, openly talk without restraint to him. [0:17:34] (pause) And that really sucks.
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah. And he's one of the best people I've ever met and he's one of, he's the best teacher I ever had and you know, my teachers, you know they, definitely a fill in for my parents and (pause) So you know, now I know. But it's hard.
THERAPIST: Um hmm. [0:18:27]
CLIENT: (pause) But I'm not willing to, I'm not willing to care about people less because everybody might get hurt. You know that seems like that's who's drawn to me. (pause) Just got to respect the boundary. (pause)
THERAPIST: I guess when you say that in part in reference to here I'm not sure which boundaries you have in mind. [0:19:50]
CLIENT: Um. (pause)
THERAPIST: And moreover, I am sort of thinking that for you thoughts about boundaries might, that I don't know what you have in mind but, might interfere or might substitute for worries about like, that they doing harm in some way to me or to therapy. Would that?
CLIENT: I'm less worried about therapy. (chuckles) [0:21:05]
THERAPIST: Sounds like you're worried about, yeah, uh huh.
CLIENT: And you know. I know you can take care of yourself. Like I know that this is, there's probably like three classes on this (inaudible at [0:21:22]) (chuckles) Yeah, I mean I guess for me it just means like I don't ask about your personal life. I don't Google you. (chuckles) And just, I (pause) and I think it sometimes does lead me to not ask about things to do with therapy, the actual therapy because I don't quite know where those things are, or those warnings are. [0:22:19]
But it's also like, so last night I was thinking and you know first I thought, "I had a really good day." And then I thought, "You know, my having a really good day is just like getting all my work done and like I'm going to go home and watch a movie and relax." This is the other side of the coin. Like this is the carrot to the stick. Like this is part of the same thing that is ultimately not helpful for me. But like I can only relax, I can only relax because I got a lot of work done.
THERAPIST: I see. [0:23:04]
CLIENT: And everything went well. And because forces outside my control converged with forces in my control and I got my shit together. If any of that hadn't happened I would beat myself up about it. And then I thought, "Man, the human mind is really cool. Psychology is really cool. (chuckles) Ok, now I see why people study this." But it's like that's not something that is going to be really useful for us to talk about in here. Like because it's like as soon as I say, "Oh, let me try to be the psychologist." Like then I'm basically trying to take myself out of where I am emotionally and say, "I can control this with my mind." (chuckles) [0:24:18]
THERAPIST: So.
CLIENT: I'm not really sure where that was going.
THERAPIST: So what, I think I didn't quite follow the train of thought there when you had a thought like that, "Wow, psychology is so cool." What inspired that?
CLIENT: You talked about their being an emotional logic to people. And kind of drawing, drawing connections to kind of understand my own emotional logic. [0:25:03]
THERAPIST: I see. Ok, so the way you like pick up a (inaudible at [0:25:12]) logic for yourself which involves seeing how you could let yourself relax because things had come together during the day and you had gotten a bunch of work done and then thought, "Huh, wow, look at that. There is a logic. That is cool." Like that? Is that?
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I'm describing, I'm actually describing as one episode what was kind of like spread out over several hours.
THERAPIST: Oh, ok.
CLIENT: So I guess it's (pause) just thinking about, thinking about ways in which you have psychological like tools and context have actually been fruitful for me in the last few months. And like ok I can see, I can see how this is helping me. I can see how this is working. [0:26:13]
You know from the outsiders prospective it seems to me like psychology is a little bit like Biblical studies in that there's a lot of really good work and there a whole lot of shit to wade through.
THERAPIST: (chuckles) I have no idea what you're talking about.
CLIENT: (chuckles) No, no idea. No critical distinction between those two. And so, but I, you know. And so I kind of waver back and forth between focusing on the bullshit and focusing on the parts that are actually really useful. But like you know I rabidly defend my own field despite the bullshit. Yes, no this is really useful. This is good stuff. It shouldn't be judged by, oh God, the guys presenting a paper on how the book of Mormon extends the Biblical descriptions of angels with wings. [0:27:31]
Sorry. I'm just like why is this paper being presented at this conference. (chuckles) This is not critical scholarship, I'm sorry. But as soon as I get interested in something intellectually I want to just kind of immerse myself in it intellectually. And so like a large part of me just wants to have a whole lot of conversations with you about that. But like, you know that's not what we're here for. That's not, yeah. Probably wouldn't do a lot of harm, but it really wouldn't help. And so, it's kind of a left loaded example. [0:28:46]
THERAPIST: Sure, sure.
CLIENT: It took much longer to describe it than I thought it was going to. (pause)
THERAPIST: I don't quite have my head around the point I want to make. I'll just start talking and maybe it will emerge.
CLIENT: That usually works for me. [0:29:43]
THERAPIST: (chuckles) I bet that something that contributed to your feeling better yesterday was you had come in here, I think, quite anxious about a few different things. One was specifically you said you've been really frightened that I was going to tell you I don't think this is working and we should stop. I think there was, I think you were very worried about telling me that. I guess, I imagine partly because you know, some part of you imagined I'd sigh and go, "Ah, thank God you said it." You know or something like that. [0:30:31]
Or maybe I kind of imagine you also worried that I was going to feel somehow criticized in there somewhere by you. I didn't know, I was thinking this wasn't working. You were really worried about that too. And as of I can tell there wasn't any fallout for bringing that stuff up. Either in terms of my going along with your thought that, "Is this working?" or "I need to stop." or that I felt criticized if you came across any of those ways really. And I didn't (inaudible at [0:31:32]) about your worry and at other times at your guilt about like acting on your own emotional need exactly the way you were doing when you were here. "Chad, this is what's freaking me out right now. I'm going to just have to trust, which is not easy, that you're going to be ok somehow in this but I need to put this out there but I'm really worried about it." [0:31:59]
And I guess I imagined that related to some of the things that are coming up today in terms of thinking psychology is cool. But then that you probably shouldn't really talk much or ask me about that. Or being worried about sort of like developing certain feelings for me and the trouble that could somehow cause. Like does that positive feeling it seems now like you're kind of a little wary of those. [0:32:55]
You know like, I take your point. I mean if we have a bunch of discussions about the research literature in psychology, there's a certain way in which, well I guess the point in my mind is like do you imagine that as avoiding important things? But it could also be reflective of your excitement, enthusiasm, positive feelings of whatever sort. And that means be important too. Do you know what I mean? I guess I have the impression that you're maybe wary of positive feelings in some (inaudible at [0:33:49]) ways you were wary of the more negative ones yesterday. [0:33:52]
CLIENT: (pause) I mean certainly yeah. When being in a good mood and kind of feel excited or having a good day, I get anxious about coming here.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: I'm like, "Am I wasting his time? I don't know. " I feel like a (inaudible at [0:34:28])
THERAPIST: I see, hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah, because in my mind this is "fix the problems". But I see, I take your point. (pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah maybe this is more "pay attention to where you're at and what's going on with you" than "fix the problems." (pause)
CLIENT: Ok. [0:35:54]
(pause) Why though?
THERAPIST: Why? [0:36:47]
CLIENT: I mean I guess my first reaction to (inaudible at [0:37:07]) maybe pay attention to where you are. Well that's not really a worth anybody's time. (chuckles) (pause) I'm unclear to what extent I would want to stick with that. [0:37:52]
THERAPIST: Um hmm. (pause) Meaning like to what extent you want to explore or to what extent you want to follow up about where you're at?
CLIENT: To what extent I think that statement is actually true.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, part of me says there will always be more problems. (chuckles) And part of me thinks that I should get out of the model of problem solving. But I'm not really sure I want to. [0:39:18]
THERAPIST: Uh huh. I think, I don't mean this as a general comment about which of those is better. But I think for you at this moment you feel worried about what happened and probably worried related to feeling guilty down the road. If the focus were to be on you rather than some, something that was at least a bit of a distance from you such as problems. [0:40:01]
A little convoluted. Like feel guilty if I was paying attention to you and not your problems, in a way.
CLIENT: That makes sense. (pause) I was, I feel the same, been thinking about this topic of him like being afraid of it and it will get better. It's a little work.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And a large part of it is like I don't what that would make me, you know? I would be something totally different. (pause) I don't know. (pause) Anyway it's like present Tanya might not like the future Tanya who likes herself. (chuckles) [0:41:50]
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: (pause) And now there are other things, called to court. But that part of it is baffling. The transformation, that's scary. [0:42:33] (pause)
I'm not sure to what extent I really think that my problems are separate from myself. I just find that, I don't know. (pause)
THERAPIST: Focusing on your problems may not be focusing away from you.
CLIENT: Yeah. You know it feels increasingly like the things that make me so kind of scared and unhappy and self destructive are also the things that make me run. But you know I don't know how I can separate the kind of model that I use to approach the world from who I am as a person, you know. That gets into the like, what is the self. (chuckles) I don't know. But as I know now it's much easier to say, "Well (inaudible at [0:44:49]) I like doing things.
THERAPIST: Who thought they knew? We have a, I guess I'll clear our schedule. So we're not meeting Monday next week. I've got a Monday and Tuesday.
CLIENT: Ok.
THERAPIST: And then I guess you're on for Wednesday, Thursday. It's going to be tough because my week and I are pretty compressed to meet on Friday as well.
CLIENT: Ok, that's fine.
THERAPIST: And I think it's probably not such a good idea to try me by phone. Yeah.
CLIENT: Ok. Well have fun.
THERAPIST: Thank you. [0:45:47]
