I was born in Needham, Massachusetts, a suburb
of Boston, in 1942, in the midst of World War II, in
which my father was killed in action. I attended St.
Sebastian's School, a Catholic prep school, graduating
in 1960, and the University of Notre Dame, graduating
in 1964. At Notre Dame, I became fascinated with literary
insights into the often self-defeating behavior
of fictional characters. This led to a period of intense
study and reading of psychoanalytic characterizations
of literary figures, and, ultimately, a vague commitment
to a career in psychology. Needing a specific laboratory
course in experimental psychology to meet
requirements for graduate school, I found a course
at Boston College in the summer of 1963, taught by
Joseph R. Cautela. That summer, while I was immersed
in the laboratories of experimental psychology, Cautela
persuaded me that only through a reliance on the slow
but inexorable progress of psychological science could
the applications of psychology to clinical problems
truly advance. Otherwise, applied and clinical psychology
would be doomed to a never-ending reliance on
fads of the moment. This was a radical idea at a time,
when psychotherapy had little or no empirical base, and
it was widely believed that none was needed. Rather, it
was thought that human behavior and psychological
disorders were far too deep and complex to submit to
the rigors of the scientific method.


In 1964, after graduating from Notre Dame, I continued
my study with Cautela at Boston College.
Publication of Joseph Wolpe's book <i>Psychotherapy
by Reciprocal Inhibition</i>, in 1958, was beginning to
create a stir and by 1964 had convinced Cautela that
"behavior therapy" might provide the means to realize
the application of the principles of psychological
science to the clinic. Having met Wolpe, Cautela
arranged for me to spend the summer of 1966 working
with Wolpe and acquiring firsthand some clinical
skills in the fledgling techniques of systematic desensitization,
assertiveness training, and direct behavioral
modification based on operant principles.


After Beverly Colby and I were married, we left
Boston in 1966 to journey to the University of
Vermont. Emboldened with a firm belief in the scientific
base of clinical psychology but with few, if any,
programs espousing that philosophy, I was fortunate to
come in contact with Harold Leitenberg, an experimental
psychologist at the University of Vermont,
who, teaming up with Stewart Agras from the psychiatry
department at that university, was beginning an
intensive program of clinical research. This program
combined Leitenberg's training and experience in laboratories
of operant psychology with Agras's deep
clinical experience and his desire to be more empirical.


When Stewart Agras decided it was time to accept
a chair in psychiatry in 1969, he invited me, just finishing
my PhD, to join him in the search. Since most
psychiatry departments were dominated in those days
by psychoanalytical approaches and were actively
hostile to more behavioral conceptualizations, the
search took a while. In the fall of 1969, we finally settled
on the University of Mississippi Medical Center,
where a small psychiatry department with a short
history had recently experienced the exodus of a
number of existing faculty, leaving mostly open positions
and creating the opportunity to shape a more

This began a productive period of 5 years in which
methodologies suitable to clinical research, such as
single-case experimental designs emanating from
the laboratories of operant psychology, were further
developed, resulting in a book published in 1976 with
Michel Hersen, <i>Single Case Experimental Designs</i>.
While at Mississippi, I continued developing my interest
in anxiety and sexual disorders and received my
first National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) grant
studying the psychological aspects of sexual dysfunctions
and deviations. I was promoted to associate professor
and then professor of psychiatry in 1974 but
had begun to miss my New England roots. When
Brown University contacted me in 1974, the interest
of the chair of psychiatry at Brown, Ben Feather, was
as much in the successful psychology internship-training
program as in the program of research. I relocated
to Brown University in February of 1975, where I
took over psychology programs with a joint appointment
as professor of psychiatry and psychology and
a charge to initiate the Brown University Clinical
Psychology Internship Program.


My research on sexuality and anxiety continued at
Brown University, as did the development of my ideas
on the integration of science and practice, which
ultimately yielded a second book, <i>The Scientist-Practitioner</i>,
written with Steve Hayes, a former intern
at Brown University, and Rosemery Nelson. During
this time, I was particularly active in the Association
for Advancement of Behavior Therapy (AABT) and
was elected president in 1979. Nevertheless, research
productivity diminished somewhat at Brown, due to
the necessity of attending to administrative and political
issues in a large department of psychiatry, and
I decided it was time to relocate to a setting that
allowed a more complete focus on clinical research.
This led to a move to the State University of New York
at Albany, joining my friend and colleague from
Mississippi days, Ed Blanchard, in 1979, where he was
to stay for 17 years. Together with Blanchard, we initiated
the Center for Stress and Anxiety Disorders, which
became a working research clinic with a large number
of grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
In this setting, many excellent doctoral students
received training in clinical research. Here also, the
major themes of my research were fully elaborated:
early research on the nosology of anxiety and mood
disorders in collaboration with Peter DiNardo and,
later, Tim Brown resulted in new conceptualizations of
generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. These
developments were communicated through my service
on the anxiety disorders work group for <i>DSM-III-R</i>
and, later, the task force for <i>DSM-IV</i>.


Research on psychopathology focused on the nature
of anxiety as evidenced in males, and, later, females,
presenting with sexual dysfunction. This particular paradigm
afforded an easily quantifiable output of the
influence of cognitive and affective components of anxiety
in the form of psychophysiological measures of
sexual arousal that could be manipulated out of the
awareness of the patient. This research resulted in an
early model of the process of anxiety manifested as
sexual dysfunction. It was also during this time that I
developed new treatments for anxiety and related disorders
in collaboration with Michelle Craske, Ron Rapee,
and others, most notably a new psychological approach
to treating panic disorder that has been widely accepted
and positively evaluated. Programmatic research on
anxiety during the decade of the 1980s resulted in a
book, pulling most of these ideas together.


In 1996, after an absence of 30 years, I returned to
Boston to become professor of psychology, research
professor of psychiatry, director of clinical programs,
and director of the Center for Anxiety and Related
Disorders at Boston University. The very next year, I
had the good fortune to fulfill a long-planned year
at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences, where I updated my theory on the origins of
anxiety disorders.


Now approaching the twilight of my career, I
expect to devote my remaining years to broadening
and deepening my theory of the origins of anxiety and
its disorders, and developing a unified treatment protocol
for the treatment of emotional disorders.
