IT IS VALENTINE'S DAY EVE and I finally send Emily the love note
she's been asking for, having no idea the short message will hit us both
like a truck. Before I hit send, I copy my sophomoric attempt at the
erotic from work email to non-work email. What I don't know is this.
Emily shares her AOL account with Vanessa. Worse, Vanessa already
suspects something. The next morning, on a day when I plan to bring a
box of truffles to my secret sweetheart, I get a panic-brief message from
Emily with the subject line, "life imitating art, sort of."


The body of the email reads, "I need to talk to you."


I call Emily right away and she sounds distant and annoyed. She
tells me Vanessa called at 7:00 AM. She tells me Vanessa knows. Her
clipped rhythm is unfamiliar and hard to read. Is she angry? Is she in
shock? I feel small and scared and embarrassed.

[p. <i>78</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I sit paralyzed on the phone. All I can say is—


<b>OH. MY. GOD.</b>


I feel heat on my face as if I'm sitting in front of a fire. All I can
think about is how to make this feeling go away. I invite Emily over
to talk that evening and sweat minutes like bullets. The clock force-marches
morning into the grim showdown of afternoon. When Emily
arrives we sit together on my couch like women in a hospital waiting
room. <i>Will she make it? How bad was the wreck? Has it been determined
whether anyone was at fault? Do you know if she has insurance?</i> We repeat
words like BLINDSIDED and JAWS OF LIFE. We are stunned. Nothing in
this crazy world makes sense.


It is Valentine's Day and I am disoriented by romantic whiplash.


The normal guardrails of healthy emotional boundaries were never
constructed inside me. I think it's normal that I feel what Emily feels.
Better than normal: I believe tuning into other people's emotions is my
secret superpower. I can bend steel with my bare hands. I can find a
way in. I am CAPTAIN EMPATHY—able to intuit feelings like Superman
leaps tall buildings. In a single bound. I see boundaries as limits. I don't
want any. Robert Frost says good fences make good neighbors but everyone
knows he secretly fantasizes about swinging from birches. The fence
thing is just Frost being afraid of his own queer passions.


<i>One could do worse than be a swinger of birches,</i> you know?

FENCES ARE FOR COWARDS.


I lied before. I do want her to tell me everything. I do want her to
reenact the entire conversation.


<i>I want more than 50 percent</i>.


LIKE A SPONGE, THE MATE WITH BOUNDARIES SET<br />
TOO CLOSE ABSORBS EVERY FROWN, EVERY<br />
TIGHTENED JAW, AND FEELS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.


—ANNE KATHERINE, <i>Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin</i>


I dump the contents of my heart in her lap and gesture for her to
pony up. I wait for her to say something but her jaw is wired shut.


<b>SCENARIO 1</b>: Vanessa might break up with Emily and
Emily might die of heartache and/or embarrassment. Vanessa
might reveal our affair to the department chair. She might create
scandal and spur reprimand. She might withdraw her hat from
the ring in our search for a new faculty member. She is a top candidate.
This could be bad for my career. I ask careful questions to
gauge Emily's temperature. I watch her face for signs of fever. I
want to know if the prospect of a breakup makes her sad (in which
case she might hate me) or happy (in which case she might love
me). This is a lot of pressure on an affair of barely three weeks.



[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We don't know what will happen. We don't know how we feel.


I want to be like Maureen in a book I'm reading about boundaries.
Her husband walks in and complains about everything he sees.
MAUREEN STAYS CALM AND RINSES THE VEGETABLES. MAUREEN STAYS
IN HER OWN PSYCHOLOGICAL SPACE.


"I don't know what caused this mood of yours,"<br />
she says, "but I know I'm okay."<br />
And then she leaves the room.


I am not Maureen. I know I'm not okay. I am nose to nose with
a fire and it's too hot. I want to fix the fire—as if the fire itself were
uncomfortable, as if the discomfort I feel were not my own.


I want to make the fire feel better. I want to love it to ashes.

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

WHEN THE SEARCH COMMITTEE selects Vanessa for the job
two days later, I tell Emily to say whatever she has to say to get Vanessa
to take the job. My anxiety about holding on to Emily is the scratchy
heat of a wool sweater in early spring, uncomfortable but manageable.
My anxiety about maintaining the department's approval is a feather
pillow against my face. I have to get out from under it. Vanessa takes
the job. Emily and I set a date to end the affair. Spring break.


"Like ripping off a Band-Aid!" I say.<br />
The week comes and goes but we do not break up.


Getting caught mobilizes a dynamic of scarcity.<br />
<i>There might not be enough love to go around</i>.


The idea that we can't be together drives us both crazy. We
cling. We panic. We glut ourselves on each other. We synchronize
our schedules. If Emily makes plans with someone else—lunch with
a friend in the next town over, breakfast with a colleague at a local
diner—I fume, <i>How could she?</i> We spend hours on the phone unable

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I would gladly just listen to you breathe," as if this<br />
proves something. I long to hang up but refuse to give<br />
in. I am dedicated to this irrational race. I run towards<br />
the ribbon as if running were its own reward.


"You always seemed so—"


Emily reaches for a word and I lean into the empty<br />
space I have become inside her mouth, hoping to be<br />
flattered and made new—


"self-contained."


"Now that you know the truth about me," I ask,<br />
"are you horrified?"


My question is not a genuine invitation to intimacy. I use it to
block the possibility of judgment. It is a request for REASSURANCE. It is
a demand that she COLLUDE with my lies and CONFIRM my psychological
alibis. We make a deal to dedicate ourselves to mutual emotional
rescue and fall in love not with each other but with this deal. This false
intimacy has a name in psychology.


It's called a NEUROTIC PACT.

—KAREN HORNEY, <i>The Neurotic Personality of Our Time</i>


We begin to admit enmeshment. Neither of us is sleeping or eating
well. We are not resting or exercising. We are in a relationship. That is
our whole job on this earth. We push risotto around on our plates, stab
the occasional olive. We leave half-eaten meals on the table and fall into
bed. We drink on empty stomachs and wake up with headaches. Our
bodies shrink. I hold my breath and hope for hypnosis. I need to hear
the words. <i>You win the prize. I will love you forever. You are worth losing
everything else</i>. Jackpot. Home base. An umpire whispers in my ear,
"You're safe."

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I enter the affair thinking of it as a light and meaningless thing,
a diversion, but when Emily does not leave me as she promises Vanessa
she will our feelings balloon and sway. We say <i>I love you</i> like we mean it
and this speech act changes everything. I feel entitled to more from her.
Soon I am weeping on the phone in outrage at impermanence, disappointment,
and loss. I weep at my own foolishness.


WITH THE INFALLIBILITY OF A SLEEPWALKER,<br />
SHE SEEKS OUT THOSE WHO, LIKE HER PARENTS,<br />
CANNOT UNDERSTAND HER. SHE WILL TRY TO MAKE<br />
HERSELF UNDERSTANDABLE TO PRECISELY THESE PEOPLE.<br />
SHE WILL TRY TO MAKE POSSIBLE WHAT CANNOT BE.
—ALICE MILLER, <i>Drama of the Gifted Child</i>


"How could I not have known? All this time?" I arrived late to the
lesbian party. I don't want it to wind down so soon.


"Can I call you later to check on you?" she asks. "Would you mind?"


I scream into the phone like a child. "If you don't, I'll hate you for
the rest of my life!" Tantrum voice. Three years old.


Emily says, "You're adorable." She doesn't realize something has
been revealed. Something neither of us will find attractive in the months
to come.

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Be terribly crazy my darling. I will anticipate you</i>.


I can hear the promise clear as a bell. Yet Emily never said anything
of the sort. That was my mistake—thinking she pledged labor or the recuperation
of loss or her hand in my hand forever.


What she said was <i>I love you</i> and the words sat light as foam on
her lip.


When I pull out our pact to point out her breach of contract I'm
startled to see my name alone at the bottom of the page. I puzzle over the
trick, closing my left eye and then my right.


Her signature is simply not there.


THE AIR IS a haze of pollen and infatuation. Green buds push out
from the tips of the Bradford pear tree outside my window. My head is
a cracked seed at the edge of explosion. Tight. Wild. Emily and I are
six weeks into our affair and for some reason we keep going out with
people who cannot be told we're together, even though the secrecy
drives me crazy. I keep overestimating my ability to maintain appearances
without losing my dignity. I am often plastered and weaving by
the end of the night.


Some people turn tables over and break porcelain figures against
the walls when they drink. Drinking is a mean streak let loose, an empty

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>"I think I love you,"</i> Emily chants, bobbing up and down next
to the stereo. She is singing along with the Partridge Family. The
song ends. She plays it again. Something in me tightens. I bore
holes in her with my stare. NOTICE ME. I furrow my brow and
concentrate, eyes spiraling like augurs through layers of wood
and flesh, hesitating just a bit before pushing through the brief
bright bone of her skull. I imagine we are Siamese twins separated
by surgery at birth. My blood runs in her veins and her blood runs
in mine. I touch a hot stove somewhere in another state and her
hand burns like she held it in a fire. I wake from a nightmare and
her heart races. My tongue is thick with stage fright. Her mouth
goes dry. I never even have to say a word. She just knows.


It's not true but I long to be connected like that. I want someone
to be able to tell I am out of sorts by the details of my distraction,
like leaving the drawers of my dresser cracked open. I want
someone to know me as well as Vanessa knows Emily. I am breaking
and entering their intimacy. It is the fact of being seen that I want to
pocket for my own.

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emily indulges me when it's convenient and ignores me when it's
not. She reminds me of a woman who dated my father when I was fifteen.
She bought me a padded bra and taught me to drive a stick. She
wanted me to like her but I saw her always looking backwards over her
shoulder to see if my father had fallen in love yet. I am not her main
audience. I do not understand her mixed signals.


Moons rise and set. Climates change. I'm still exactly the same—


TEENAGER GROWN WOMAN ANGRY CHILD PROTEST CRY.


Emily holds me by the wrists and claps my hands. I don't know
how to say <i>it hurts</i> or <i>I want you to stop</i>.


A woman in pale blue cowboy boots made doe eyes at my father
fifteen years ago. She swiveled the ash from her Virginia Slims into the
shape of a sharp pencil with its tip on fire. He wasn't in love with her.
He was rebuilding something my mother tore down. He wanted to be
wanted. I wanted him to be happy again and make jokes in the car
instead of listening to jazz trumpets groan and warble while his jaw
clenched and unclenched. I wanted to see him happy and silly and filled
up and this cowgirl made him smile again so I listened politely and never
so much as twitched my lip at the twang of her oval-shaped vowels.

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was fifteen and could not name my emotions if I tried. My poems
came out sticky and dark and bizarre—more breakfast club than bell
jar—and they all said the same thing.


NO ONE AT THE TABLE SEES ME.


IF YOU ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP WHERE YOU FEEL<br />
GREAT SWINGS IN FEELINGS FROM LOVE TO HATRED<br />
AND ANGER, YOU CAN BE SURE THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO<br />
MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP WITHOUT HAVING ACCEPTED<br />
THE OTHER PERSON'S COMPLEXITY. PROBABLY YOU ARE<br />
HOPING TO CHANGE THE OTHER PERSON, WHICH MAY BE,<br />
AT ROOT, A WAY OF PURSUING AN OLD TASK OF TRYING<br />
TO TURN YOUR UNSATISFYING PARENTS INTO<br />
GRATIFYING ONES. THE INTENSITY OF THIS TASK AND<br />
THE RAGE THAT ACCOMPANIES IT CAN BE JUST AS MUCH<br />
A PART OF THE ADDICTIVE TIE AS THE LOVING FEELINGS.
—HOWARD HALPERN, <i>How to Break Your Addiction to a Person</i>


I sit across the room from Emily in a house where no one knows
we're together and I am erased by her secrecy. I need her to see me
because I am still fifteen / still eleven / still three / a cracked seed.

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I WANT TO SHAKE EMILY. I want to leave bruises shaped like question
marks on her neck. I want to ask rude questions like <i>Why are you
like this?</i> I want her to ache with longing for me in the joints of her
fingers and the small of her back. I want her to be a million-dollar mansion
blazing out of control when the fire could not be contained to the
bathtub. I reach into my pocket for a book of matches. I love her with a
pyromaniac's passion. I want Emily to burn for me. I want to be a mistake
she can never take back.


I distract myself from the disorientation of being Emily's secret by
pretending to greet the present moment as if I invited it. Emily steals
kisses with me in the stairwell like the party is a Victorian poem. She
whispers sweet nothings to me by the kitchen sink and pops an olive in
my mouth as she asks me to sleep over. She wants to play a game where
we are sisters and one of us is dying and the other one has to kiss her back
to life. We draw secrets and promises like fruit-flavored candies from the
recesses of our open mouths.


I taste the bitterness of rare pears on my lips.


I should decline her invitation but I don't.

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The evening wears on and on. I wait to be claimed and each hour
weighs heavier than the last. I want to tell Emily I am dying for real and
she must step in immediately to save me. I send this message to her with
my powers of mental telepathy but she averts her eyes.


<i>Oh!</i> I say to myself. <i>I get it</i>.


The wine turns sour in my mouth so I fill a fresh glass with
straight bourbon.


I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH to be her real romantic partner. I'M NOT
GOOD ENOUGH to introduce as her girlfriend. I'm just the second best girl
you pull into the corner when no one is looking.


I hate her for a minute.


Emily rejects my self-loathing with the wave of a hand and a
smile as fast as a fox, but nothing she says can stop me from using the
NOT GOOD ENOUGH story to confirm every negative thing I ever thought
about myself.


TOXIC. UNWANTED.


<i>He's not even your real father</i>.


When the party ends I point my car towards home and drive
too fast towards the beach, flushed with wine and shame and secrecy
and sudden clarity. <i>I have to get away from her. I have to get out of here</i>.

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Picture me standing on a beach with Emily and drawing a line in the
sand with the sharp edge of a broken shell.


Picture me writing UNACCEPTABLE on Emilys side of the line.


That's what driving home felt like. Something broken and hollow
in my hand. A deep groove in the sand. Leaving is my most practiced
psychological defense—sudden, manic, and laced with persecutory
anxiety—the disappearing act.


The one where I am suddenly gone.


Out the door like Johnny Paycheck.


I mobilize my inner resources to stand up for better emotional labor
conditions. I am the protestor, the protested, and the sign of protest itself.


Take this job and shove it.<br />
I ain't working here no more.


By tomorrow I will become the scab. <i>I'm just glad for a paycheck
in the right-to-work state of this relationship,</i> I will say. <i>Times are hard
all around,</i> I'll say, but even I won't believe my rationalizations. I'll
sling my arms out at my sides like I mean this whole upset apple cart
world—from South Carolina to the flaming tip of Tierra del Fuego—
like we are all in a land of fire and everyone on this planet is ready
to STOP, DROP, AND ROLL just like me. <i>This is about survival</i>. I will
already be walking away from the camera when I yell my last words in
the direction of my imaginary interviewer.


<i>People do what they have to do</i>.

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I get home, I call Emily.


The neurotic expects to rid herself of<br />
the consequences of her unresolved conflicts<br />
without changing anything inside her at all.


I can't end the affair but I won't swallow the humiliation that
comes with it.


I live inside this contradiction like city dwellers live in small towns.


I manage. I make do. I sort through a shelf of brown lettuce in
Bi-Lo muttering <i>I hate this place</i> under my breath.


As a rule, the relationship from which she expects<br />
heaven on earth only plunges her into deeper misery.<br />
She is all too likely to carry her conflicts into the<br />
relationship and thereby destroy it. Even the most<br />
favorable possibility can relieve only the actual<br />
distress; unless her conflicts are resolved her<br />
development will still be blocked.


We spend most of the night on the phone—lying in the separate
bedrooms of the separate houses of our separate lives—both of us staring
into space in silence.

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I HOLD MY BREATH in the morning shower while warm water
streams on to my face. I rub my eyes and wet my hair, scratch shampoo
into my scalp, then scrub the skin on my arms and legs with a
rough ocean sponge to urge opiates from my nervous system. I want
endorphins and enkephalins with my coffee to take the sting of self-deprivation
from my eyes.


It's time to give my weekly lecture in a survey class on American
literature. I suit up for my off-off-broadway performance of a woman
supposed by other people to know something about something. I wear
my merino wool blazer like a breastplate. I need to feel safe. ARMORED.


I walk into the room already lecturing.


I reach the front of the room and turn to face a long wall of white
boards where I map out the meaning of a famous short story by Herman
Melville in purple marker ink. The story is a study in dissatisfaction
published in 1853 called <i>Bartleby, the Scrivener,</i> about a man who takes
a boring and mindless job copying legal briefs in a lawyer's office. The
other staff members—an alcoholic and a neurotic—are obnoxious and
the lawyer leads with a weak hand.

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The line everyone remembers from this story belongs to Bartleby.
"I would prefer not to," he says in response to every request. He bobs
up and down and pushes repeat. Like a girl with an eating disorder,
all his power lies in saying no. He makes an art of disguised refusal.
His NO wears the wig and dark sunglasses of preference. He hides his
NO underneath the knife, gun, pepper spray, garbage bags, and rubber
tubing in the trunk. His life is a love poem to a man who doesn't want
him anymore.


The poem consists of one word. NO.


The lawyer has no idea how to respond to Bartleby's refusal to play
his assigned social role. He is weak and confused, and students despise
him. I think the lawyer and I are kindred spirits. He ignores and cajoles.
He pleads. <i>He yells</i>. HE STEPS BACK. Like a lesbian one-night-stand, he
invites Bartleby to move in with him. Bartleby prefers not to. The lawyer
asks Bartleby to be a little reasonable but Bartleby prefers not be reasonable.
Scholars of literature have diagnosed Bartleby as depressed and
possibly autistic. No one has yet pointed out the PATHOGENIC ENVIRONMENT
that draws out Bartleby's crazy side. For one thing the lawyer is a
drama queen. He calls the police, who then cart Bartleby to jail, where
he prefers not to eat. Bartleby grows thin and then thinner. Eventually
his lungs prefer not to breathe.

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Most people don't see Bartleby as a teenage girl like I do.


Most people don't see NO as the answer to the meaning of life.


The story is usually taught as a comment on the demoralizing rise
of industrial capitalism—the long hours, repetitive stress injuries, tight
quarters and unforgiving chairs, the mindless work, the interchangeable
workers, the alienation of human labor—and I dutifully chart the readings
of Bartleby as Melville's interruption of capitalism's dehumanizing
instrumentalist values. YOU ARE WHAT YOU DO. A GOOD MAN IS A GOOD
WORKER. He saves money and complaints for his family. Or he saves
them for the weekend and spends them on whiskey and whores.


My students are fervent instrumentalists who take Bartleby preferring
not to as a pansy-assed abdication of responsibility. They want a
world that makes easy sense. They want a good grade in this class and a
college degree for a job and an income and a retirement account. They
are not here for the subtle highs of ambiguity like Demerol taking top
off the top of my head.


I crave questions without answers and stories that are not what
they seem on the surface. <i>I don't know what good is,</i> I imagine myself
saying, <i>and neither do you</i>. I want to say <i>Most of us know good like</i>

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I want to tell them this is what Bartleby and all great literature
is about.


THE FACT THAT I'M NOT A GOOD PERSON.


I want to tell them I carve scarlet letters in my skin like hate
mail in the dead letter office of my body. <i>They pile up over time,</i> the
lawyer says of the dead letters at the post office where Bartleby once
worked, <i>and are burned by the cartload. When I think of this loss I can
hardly express the emotions that seize me</i>. I share his distress over the
idea of misdirected messages—MISSIVES PARDONING THOSE WHO DIED
DESPAIRING, ENVELOPES BEARING RINGS FOR FINGERS MOLDING IN
THE GRAVE, WORDS OF RELIEF FOR THOSE WHO DIED STIFLED BY
UNRELIEVED CALAMITIES—and I too want to return to the errands of
life and stop calling things by the wrong name.


I want to say my apartment is no paradise for bachelorettes
and would be more accurately described by terms like PAIN CLINIC,

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I want to say her words are wrong.


I turn my back to my students and recite the unspoken words of
the lawyer as he tries to read Bartleby and fails.


"He calls Bartleby an inscrutable text," I say. I write INSCRUTABLE
in tall aubergine letters on the board. I stare at the term in awe. "This
is not a story about preferences," I say. I face the class, close the book,
and ground my point in the audacity of softened speech. "This is a story
about not knowing the right thing to do." I search the blurred frustrated
faces in front of me. "This is a story," I say, watching for signs of epiphany
or protest in their expressions, "about not being able to understand
someone." Some students listen closely and nod with encouragement.
Others perch with packed book-bags, one foot pointing towards the
door. They already know more than I know.


<i>Bartleby and the lawyer deserve each other</i>.


If either of them really wanted happiness he would grow a spine
and stop wasting time talking to someone who will never understand
him.

When Emily calls me in the car on my way home from<br />
campus I shriek with delight into the phone. "You<br />
called!" I emote. "I didn't think you would call!"


"I miss you," she says in a soft narcotic voice. "I can<br />
think of nothing but you."


"My darling!" I say.


At home I peel wool from my body, wash sweat from my face, and
wipe traces of red lipstick from the corners of my mouth. I wear pink slippers
and drink red wine and fall into a deep blue sea of dreamless sleep.


SPRING ENDS and has neither killed me nor made me stronger.


The month of May is my break from the classroom. I relish the
freedom to read whatever I want. What I want to read are AIDS memoirs.
I am comforted by their treatments of grief. I am on a vision quest.
I am on a long train of thought.


I sit still in the lizard cold of the air conditioning. I fall into a physical
torpor. The scoliosis twist and rotation soon radiate pain through
my legs and hips and back. I am lurching towards the bathroom like an
old lady when my muscles make a violent revolt. Seized by panic and

I call Emily and tell her I can't stand on my feet.


She becomes my EMERGENCY CONTACT.


EMILY comes over the next night and cooks me dinner but I can't
eat. The hot prickling inflammation of my sacroiliac joints feels like a
form of need. I need her. The need tastes like metal.


"I'm going to lose you," I say. "Everything's going to change." I am
not asking for reassurance. I want to make her tell me the terrible truth.
I want to make her admit it will hurt.


"I will still love you," she murmurs in my ear. "That won't change."
She stands beside my chair and wraps me in her arms.


"I don't know what that means," I say.


The top of my head aches from the pressure of her chin. I close my
eyes and do not ask her to move.


EMILY sends a bouquet of hot pink rosebuds the next day and I
skip past I love you to the blank space where her name should be. I
squint at the small white rectangle marked with her message—xoxo—
and I sound out its curves and slashes in the slow vowels of speech after
a stroke.


"<b>ZOH</b>... <b>ZOH</b>..."

I want it to be Sanskrit for You POSSESS ME. Or some ancient
symbol used by women in love with each other as a vow of loyalty that
loosely translates as <i>I will call your name in public for all the world to hear
and they will know I love you and you will know it and all manner of things
will be well</i>. I picture it tattooed in a trail down my spine. I need the
message to mean something. I need it to be real.


But the word that is not a word slips stupidly from my mouth.


Even the oily stain it leaves on the floor is something I imagine.
