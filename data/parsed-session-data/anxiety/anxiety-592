BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Come in.
CLIENT: Hello.
THERAPIST: Hi, Catherine, how are you?
CLIENT: I'm good, how are you?
THERAPIST: Good. How was your week?
CLIENT: It was good.
THERAPIST: And your Labor Day?
CLIENT: Good, I really didn't even realize till like that day that it was Labor Day, I was just (therapist laughing – inaudible - 0:00:14.1). I didn't go home or anything, I planned to originally but I don't know it was like crazy just with school, a lot of reading.
THERAPIST: Oh so you had to like work all weekend?
CLIENT: Yeah. A lot, a lot of reading because I guess the beginning of the semester so my teachers are like oh read Chapters 1 through whatever.
THERAPIST: I love that, 1 through 12, the whole book.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yes, so just a lot of reading.
THERAPIST: Did you get to enjoy the weather at all?
CLIENT: Not really I just kind of stayed in or went to school pretty much every day.
THERAPIST: Okay, well, at least you got to like see outside the window while you read, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. But it wasn't I mean it wasn't a bad week though, I mean reading isn't too bad.
THERAPIST: No, it's better then writing papers or taking tests.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right?
CLIENT: Definitely and that's to come soon so.
THERAPIST: Now, you said you're taking five courses? (0:01:02.0)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay, so you had like a full.
CLIENT: Yeah, and two of them are writing intensive courses so that's also what I guess there's a lot of reading right now because I'm going to be writing a bunch of papers.
THERAPIST: What's your major?
CLIENT: Psychology. I actually, I just switched so I'm kind of new to the major, I was going for math for awhile until I didn't know what I wanted to do.
THERAPIST: So do you think coming to therapy as a part of it or?
CLIENT: It was always something I feel like since I started way back in high school, it was always something I would think about but then I was kind of like oh I'll be in school forever and I didn't want to do it and I didn't have my mind set on it so I chose math thinking oh I like math it's easy for me.
THERAPIST: It's unusual.
CLIENT: An easy way out.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Be a teacher or whatever and then I realized no I don't like math, it's driving me crazy so.
THERAPIST: Well, not everybody gets on, you know like goes on and does the thousand year track that I'm doing.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know because you can do a lot with I think a psychology undergrad.
CLIENT: Well, I've been thinking more about it now that I'm in school and whatnot, like I don't know I just I've grown up somewhat in the past few years but so I don't know, see how it goes. (0:02:16.3)
THERAPIST: It's funny because people, you know my friends will always say oh you're like … sometimes they'll be like oh you're so lucky you actually know what you want to do and I'm like well you're out doing it.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah a lot of my friends actually, one of my friends graduated early so she's already starting and whatnot so it's interesting but. And then my other friend is getting her four year degree and she decided she wants to be a pharmacist so now she's has got to go to school for six years because she didn't do anything towards it.
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: So.
THERAPIST: Well, how many courses have you … which psych courses are you taking this semester?
CLIENT: Right now I'm taking two pretty general, Women's Psychology -
THERAPIST: I like Women's Psychology.
CLIENT: - and then Animal Behavior.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: So it's like I had to take two courses in a certain level so I picked those because Women's I also, I needed a … it also takes another general requirement for like a women's study so. (0:03:11.1)
THERAPIST: Well, there's a (inaudible - 0:03:13.5)?
CLIENT: Well, it's not directly for that, I forget what it is but it's like a dual like it takes away (therapist laughing – inaudible - 0:03:20.9), so why not.
THERAPIST: (inaudible - 0:03:22.6).
CLIENT: But it's actually an interesting course.
THERAPIST: No I really, I liked Women's Psychology.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: The professor sometimes can be a little …
CLIENT: I actually like my professor (therapist laughing – inaudible - 0:03:31.7), like I don't know she's a good professor and she's nice (inaudible - 0:03:36.4) so.
THERAPIST: I had like an ultra feminine like.
CLIENT: That's what I was expecting but it's not too bad so.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I sort of like it but it was a little rough.
CLIENT: It's funny because then we have, we have a few guys in the class not too many, and then when they speak sometimes they say things that like offend people so (inaudible - 0:03:55.0).
THERAPIST: And all the women are like.
CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm like uh-hmm we're guys shouldn't be in here.
THERAPIST: Why did they (inaudible - 0:04:00.3)?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Too many girls.
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.
THERAPIST: So do you remember what your homework was?
CLIENT: Yes. I actually have that sheet.
THERAPIST: Very, actually I might have you fill out another one right here before and that way you don't have to take it home every week.
CLIENT: Oh okay.
THERAPIST: But it's here for you.
CLIENT: I didn't apply for my job.
THERAPIST: You didn't? Well, we can talk about that.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay? So you want to fill out this one?
CLIENT: Yes. (inaudible - 0:04:29.8)
THERAPIST: It's pretty well here because that way it will be easier (inaudible - 0:04:36.5) back and forth every week.
CLIENT: Okay. Should I fill it out now or after?
THERAPIST: I think it's good beforehand because then it's like if the therapy has a benefit then it's not going in yet you know it will be like for the end of the week.
CLIENT: Okay. Now, your, if I, alright because when I was reading through this a few days ago, do you want me to put like if I have thought about one of these statements but also like I think I agree but yet I disagree kind of neutral, do you want me to put neutral like I'm not really sure? (0:05:14.1)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Or no?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It's something that I have thought before but not right now.
THERAPIST: Oh yeah then I guess neutral would be more -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - the way to go because it wouldn't be not at all or you know.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I know it's weird that it's neutral because it's like some -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - but not, I know what you mean.
CLIENT: Because it's, I don't know I found myself saying some of these things.
THERAPIST: But then put them maybe for, you know.
CLIENT: Okay. (Filling out a form)
THERAPIST: Thank you, do you want me to look at this now? (0:07:03.9)
CLIENT: A lot were neutral but that's, I feel like because I don't know, it depends on how I'm feeling when I fill them out because I can notice -
THERAPIST: You don't have to …
CLIENT: - like the difference.
THERAPIST: Yeah. No, and I think you know the fact that they are even a bunch of 5's, you know those are things to work on.
CLIENT: Uh-hmm.
THERAPIST: And now we'll know, be able to track it better.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And see if it is getting better. So I'll keep track of these and make sure I know what we're doing and hopefully (inaudible - 0:07:29.8) if not oh well that's that. Right? So I feel better about that, you've seen Psychology like doing the research stuff can really help.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And then the practice of it. Because I just don't want to do things because I think that they'll work and then they don't you know.
CLIENT: Well, yeah. I think it's a good idea also because I feel like I've been going from person to person kind of just staying at the same level so I feel like just working on it -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - and actually doing something is good.
THERAPIST: Okay, good.
CLIENT: So that's why I came here so.
THERAPIST: Did you feel like working (inaudible - 0:08:01.2)?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Did you feel like you had made some progress with her?
CLIENT: I did because it was a big switch, I don't know for me seeing my physiologist like he was an older man, I really liked him but it was just kind of like more him talking to me and me just kind of like sitting there and chiming in once in awhile.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So it wasn't very, I don't know it was, I would go like talk to him I would feel better for like a day and then my anxiety would be back and it would dwell until the next time I saw him.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So it was kind of, it was nice to have a change.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: To be more proactive about it.
THERAPIST: Definitely. So there were two homework assignments that I remember. One of them was to look for the job and another one was to say something to your roommate about her making comments about your job or the lack of job.
CLIENT: Yeah, I actually didn't, I more spoke to her about things around the apartment that were bothering me.
THERAPIST: Oh you did?
CLIENT: And that was more recently like two days ago. (0:09:01.7)
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So it was, I spoke to her about something else but not about the job.
THERAPIST: But not.
CLIENT: Because it kind of slipped my mind but.
THERAPIST: Okay. Well, was it, is it hard usually to talk to her about things that are bothering you around the apartment?
CLIENT: It's hard to me but I never really tried so it's not like and the few times that I have said something it's not like she has gone crazy she's very fine about it so. I don't know I let her know like a few things around the apartment that were bothering me and whatnot and she was okay about it, she was like oh I'm so sorry, I'm like no sorry just from now on -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - things should be like this or.
THERAPIST: What was bothering you with the stuff around the apartment?
CLIENT: Just a lot of cleanliness which is hard, I feel bad talking to somebody about like I don't want them to think I think they're dirty or something, I feel like that is offensive so I don't want to like come off too strong. So there were a few things that I just wanted to be a little bit cleaner because I felt like it was very unhealthy and whatnot. (0:10:04.7)
THERAPIST: What were the things?
CLIENT: Just like the dishes and whatnot. Like she doesn't ever do them so I do them everyday so I could … like it drives me insane.
THERAPIST: So you do all of her dishes everyday?
CLIENT: Yeah, because otherwise she'll leave them for like a week in there -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - and she won't even like put water in there it's like things that drive, little things that I'm like -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - ooh.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And like other areas of the apartment that never ever get cleaned.
THERAPIST: And you find yourself usually do it for her?
CLIENT: Yeah, that's, that has been driving be crazy for like this past year I feel like small things because we have two cats too so it's like, it's clean the litter box everyday so.
THERAPIST: Well, that's good. Were you nervous before you … did you like think about approaching her or did you just do it all of a sudden?
CLIENT: I felt really bad like I don't know I just sort of, I didn't know if I should because I don't know I felt like it would come off the wrong way I didn't know how she would take it. And I always, like I always vent to my mom about it like when I'm done cleaning I'll call her up and she's like well just say like can you clean this or why don't you clean this, like just tell her and I'm always like oh no next time and the next time comes the same thing happens. (0:11:16.4)
THERAPIST: So have you noticed a difference, I mean it has been only two days?
CLIENT: It has only been two days and normally it's like she'll do the dishes when I tell her or something and then it will just not, I don't know the same thing will happen.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like it will repeat so I'm going to wait and see. I said this time I was like and from now on like I don't care you don't have to say you're sorry like it's fine like whatever but from now on, I tried to make that point and like just stay clean.
THERAPIST: Good, good for you. And did she, did the world explode?
CLIENT: No, it actually felt like better just to say from now on because like I've said things a few times in the past but it's like nothing ever changes so I figured if she at least knows that I'm really, really annoyed by this, like I told her I'll keep bugging you now if you don't. (0:12:05.5)
THERAPIST: Really.
CLIENT: So because after she was like okay like yeah, alright I'm going to keep bugging you like.
THERAPIST: Yeah. And she's okay with that?
CLIENT: Yeah she was fine so it was a lot, I don't know it felt.
THERAPIST: And remember we talked about having like a real friendship anyway if something were … you need to let each other know the little things that annoy each other or else you're kind of being you know just dishonest with your friends.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know if you don't tell them that, if something they say bothers you it can't be that close of a friendship.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I feel like it was I was resenting like living with her because of just not telling her how I felt so it was kind of nice. Like now I feel better. Like I don't know she's very, a very overwhelming person, very talkative but she doesn't mean to be so it's and I'm not, well I guess I probably seem talkative to you. But I'm normally like I don't really talk much at all so it's like hard for me to really get a word in. (0:13:03.8)
THERAPIST: Yeah, no but it sounds like you were able to.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Now what's preventing you from talking the same thing about the job? Is it really that you forgot this week?
CLIENT: This week it really is I forgot but I don't know I just I feel she's going to like just laugh at me or something and be like really like okay. I guess it's not a big deal if she says that but.
THERAPIST: Even if she laughs so it will probably be likely to not do it again or think about it before she does it.
CLIENT: Uh-hmm. So I guess it's still something I should do because.
THERAPIST: Because it's the same type of relationship like -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - this is your close friend, she should know how you feel and she wouldn't want to be insulting you.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think she would take offense if I said anything or make fun of me actually. I don't think she would laugh but.
THERAPIST: (inaudible - 0:13:55.0) this is something I'm really sensitive and I know it's kind of a silly thing -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - but to me it's you know it's important. (0:14:03.7)
CLIENT: Yeah. I'll talk to her hopefully this week.
THERAPIST: Now, here's the real question, what is so – what's the problem with maybe offending somebody?
CLIENT: I don't know I feel like …
THERAPIST: I've heard you say that a bunch of times.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I feel bad like. I don't, I don't know I'm guess I'm where I don't know what they're going to say back, how they're going to react, I hate confrontation like arguments, I'm kind of just …
THERAPIST: Is it the not knowing how they're going to react or is it the anticipating a negative reaction?
CLIENT: It's more anticipating a negative reaction because that's normally like I'm not thinking oh I don't know how they're going to act it's more like oh what if they act like they get mad or something or annoyed or.
THERAPIST: Do people get annoyed with you ever? You seem like a pretty inoffensive person.
CLIENT: I guess but people say I'm always like you're quiet, like whatever and I, I don't know I usually wait till last something really annoys me and like I explode (therapist laughing – inaudible 0:15:08.4), I'm like don't really say much.
THERAPIST: It sounds like maybe some, I mean some of the quietness that's personality, some of it is what we're born with, some of it's our temperament, you know where our sibling number you know in the family, it is what we have learned. But it also sounds like a quietness is you know because you don't want to have that, to anyone to ever have that reaction to you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But the avoiding.
CLIENT: I guess I do kind of avoid it. And if I ever do have like a confrontation with someone or whatever I get very, like I get that feeling in my stomach that I get when I have the anxiety like until it's solved like, I don't like any arguments or fights or whatever like. And it's not like I can go about my day like that's all I think like I'm obsessed with like solving it kind of thing. (0:16:04.3)
THERAPIST: Yeah, what kind of thoughts go on in your head?
CLIENT: I don't know it's hard to say now because something like that hasn't really happened recently but I mean.
THERAPIST: Because it never happens because you never let it happen.
CLIENT: Like but.
THERAPIST: So I think the major issue is more the, because it's not even that the ruminating over I've upset her it's the ruminating over I shouldn't, I must not say anything that could be offensive because that would be so uncomfortable and you know if they were to get mad but you never -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - you never let anyone, you never see how people are going to react.
CLIENT: I know, I guess I use to like back when I was in high school and whatnot but I don't know I got to college and just like.
THERAPIST: So in high school you felt like you kind of spoke up more and said hey I thought you weren't so, you weren't so concerned -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - with the fact that some might be offended?
CLIENT: Not that I didn't care but it was more I would I guess not think so much before it was like every conversation, every like, I feel like now I just always am overanalyzing every situation. (0:17:09.8)
THERAPIST: What if someone was mad, like was offended by something you said, what would happen?
CLIENT: I don't know, I apologize I guess but.
THERAPIST: No, but how would you feel?
CLIENT: I don't know I would feel I want to say bad but I feel that's not really explaining much but.
THERAPIST: You felt uncomfortable?
CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like that would be a good word just very uncomfortable for me to deal with that.
THERAPIST: What do you think is going to help you feel more comfortable?
CLIENT: I don't know. Trying to not care, not I feel like that's something bad, like bad to say but not not care about their feelings but at least stick up for myself more.
THERAPIST: You know what I think, I mean I think all of this is going to be helpful but I think generally in all things in life what is going to be helpful for you is to learn to tolerate that discomfort. (0:18:01.9)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Tolerate the discomfort and you probably said it before like you know the statements it's uncomfortable but I can stand it, right?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: But even though you tell yourself that you don't quite believe it yet.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's, I can believe it now in the moment and the whatnot I can see behind the thinking of it but then when I'm in that situation it's kind like I can't stop that feeling of like discomfort, like creeping up on me like it just, I don't know it's so natural now or I feel like it's just like second nature.
THERAPIST: Yeah. If … look if I was wearing something that you thought was ugly could you say I don't like that? I don't know those shoes are …
CLIENT: They're probably (laughing – inaudible - 0:18:48.1).
THERAPIST: You probably would have.
CLIENT: But.
THERAPIST: Well, that's kind of rude, that's kind of rude to say.
CLIENT: I don't understand that if someone like asks me but even if someone asked me I'll go no. Like I guess if my roommate asked me like if I really didn't like it I usually am like hmm, hmm. (0:19:02.0)
THERAPIST: You would be really uncomfortable what to say.
CLIENT: I'm nicer then other people are, not like that they're mean when they say things but I do try to sugar coat a lot so I guess, I do tell, like I will tell someone if they ask me but I kind of more like let them figure it out, kind of hint to it.
THERAPIST: What do you think of my shoes?
CLIENT: I would wear them.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't know there's nothing about what I'm wearing today that you think is kind of … what if you had to tell me that something was unattractive that I was wearing would you feel really uncomfortable?
CLIENT: I would be because I feel like I don't know, we don't know each other on that level so.
THERAPIST: But that's, that's the difficult part you know.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I want, what I want you to do is to put yourself in uncomfortable situations because I think you avoid it.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: And I think you know that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And what's really going to be like, you know you tried taking pills, you tried, that's going to the magic you know.
CLIENT: Uh-hmm. (0:20:00.7)
THERAPIST: To learn that you can tolerate it and nothing happened.
CLIENT: I think I have been able to avoid it so much because I don't have a job, don't really need to get a job so I've been able to avoid it a lot that way so I just hang out with the people that I've been hanging out with since before my anxiety got to bad.
THERAPIST: And even still with your roommate there are things that are anxiety provoking that you -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - avoid saying that those things are hurtful. I mean everybody I kind of think says oh it's not that important to say this -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - but I think … what do you think would make so that you do … like what prevented you from doing the job stuff this week? Because you had a lot of free time.
CLIENT: I just I did have because I was just reading so I could have and whatnot but I don't know I think it was more just maybe laziness this week, not necessarily, I wasn't thinking about it too much kind of just doing my reading and going through the week so it was less, like I really wasn't thinking about it too much so. (0:21:06.0)
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I wasn't like worrying because I wasn't.
THERAPIST: Because you weren't doing it?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But was there something that maybe prevented you from doing it? The thought of being uncomfortable (inaudible - 0:21:16.9)?
CLIENT: Yeah, it's probably easier for me to say oh I'll do it next week, because I feel like I've been doing that forever and that's what has kind of been going through my head oh I'll go next week and or this weekend I was planning on it so I'm like, I keep like delaying it.
THERAPIST: What do you think is going … like is there something that you could reward yourself with or not allow yourself to do unless you do it?
CLIENT: I think that would be better then rewarding myself because I think the reward would be just having savings again so.
THERAPIST: So you got manicure, pedicure every week?
CLIENT: No I do it myself.
THERAPIST: You do it yourself?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Is there something that you like, like to go out and do? (0:22:01.4)
CLIENT: I'm trying to think, I don't know because I feel like I don't really go out because I avoid it so much so if I say like oh …
THERAPIST: What about to get like some food or like if you were to do something and then, like if you were to actually go do it and then what if you got a manicure?
CLIENT: I guess I have, I am a compulsive like shopper even though I don't have jobs so I shouldn't be but I've been trying, like I'll just go into a store and like buy one thing and think that's okay kind of so maybe …
THERAPIST: So is there something that you really want right now?
CLIENT: No, but it's very like I don't know I hate being downtown so I just go back after this because I have nothing because if I have free time I'll walk into a store and want to shop so.
THERAPIST: Yeah, well, look I know you don't want to spend money so what's something that you know that would be rewarding?
CLIENT: I guess, I don't know just being able to tell my family I have a job or tell my … (0:23:04.0)
THERAPIST: So that's reward enough.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Can you think about that when you're …
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that's like the one, that's what I think about mostly just, not necessarily telling them but just like ooh I'll feel like relieved, I'll feel so much better, like better about myself, so I kind of think about that and that's what will get me to like go online and start looking and then that kind of fades away and I stop thinking about it and then get distracted. But that's like usually the main thing like just because I know that it will make, like I'll just feel so much better in general because that's like one thing that has been bothering me.
THERAPIST: What's something that like you do like you could punish yourself but if you don't do your assignment that would bother you?
CLIENT: Punishment. I'm trying to think.
THERAPIST: Do you do your nails every single week?
CLIENT: Yeah, or whenever like … (0:24:00.3)
THERAPIST: Are they getting bad yet?
CLIENT: Well, I just did these and it sort of like came off but.
THERAPIST: Is that something that you want to go home and do immediately?
CLIENT: No, because see that wouldn't be a reward or a punishment because I don't really care.
THERAPIST: What about, like not being allowed to wash the dishes or something until you?
CLIENT: Oh that would drive me insane so I guess that would work.
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: Yeah, because that would get me to because I wash the, every time I come home I'm like washing dishes.
THERAPIST: What are you doing today?
CLIENT: Actually nothing except homework so I guess I can start today.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Start applying.
THERAPIST: So where are you going to look after this?
CLIENT: I think I want to, I don't know because I always say I want to look by me and then I'm like oh I wish I could have worked downtown, but then when I work downtown I wished I worked closer to home so I think I'm going to look by, in a store that just. (0:25:01.3)
THERAPIST: Okay. What stores are, (inaudible - 0:25:03.5)?
CLIENT: I live two blocks from Jackson.
THERAPIST: Okay. (inaudible - 0:25:06.5).
CLIENT: So I'm thinking of walking, if I walk up and down (inaudible - 0:25:09.2), I know.
THERAPIST: There's a Banana Republic there, right?
CLIENT: Yeah, there's a Limited so.
THERAPIST: I know you said that Limited something but Gap treats you better then.
CLIENT: Yeah, I actually I've applied to that Limited when I first moved there like two years ago and they didn't hire me so, but I could apply again.
THERAPIST: So the goal of this as I meant is not to get hired perhaps, even going into stores that you don't care about.
CLIENT: I could do that then.
THERAPIST: Right, you could maybe even start with those because you don't really care if you get it.
CLIENT: Maybe it will be easier if I go today because I don't have school.
THERAPIST: No school and you're not allowed to wash your dishes.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: You can't wash dishes tonight if you don't do this.
CLIENT: Alright, that will be hard. So.
THERAPIST: And I imagine how much your roommate would be judging you.
CLIENT: Yeah, she'll be like you just (therapist laughing – inaudible - 0:25:55.3), do dishes.
THERAPIST: Yeah. So you think you can do that today?
CLIENT: Yes. (0:26:00.3)
THERAPIST: It's going to be a little rainy but you're going to do it anyway.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's fine.
THERAPIST: And it might be better because the stores might be more empty.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't mind the rain.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So which stores are you going to go into? Do you have a game plan?
CLIENT: I think I'm going to start at Limited and then just go to any, I don't know, stay away from the smaller stores and go to just like the bigger, maybe I don't know if I would want to work in Urban Outfitters. I love shopping there.
THERAPIST: Why don't you just go in anyway?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Even if you don't want to work there you don't have to take the job if they offer it, right?
CLIENT: And yeah and I guess like Footlocker is there.
THERAPIST: Looking for shoes?
CLIENT: I'm going to like the (inaudible - 0:26:38.7), there's like one on every corner.
THERAPIST: Exactly.
CLIENT: And just apply so.
THERAPIST: Exactly.
CLIENT: I'll do that.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Uh-hmm.
THERAPIST: So what are you going to go in and say?
CLIENT: Hello, I'm looking to apply for a job I'm just wondering if you had an application or actually I will probably ask to speak, if it's a some place I really, really want to work I'll ask to speak to the manager. (0:27:03.3)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Because that's, I normally ask to speak to the manager so.
THERAPIST: So how do you practice because you know you have some social anxiety? So how do you practice your assertiveness getting a job?
CLIENT: I don't really usually practice.
THERAPIST: Well, let's shake hands.
CLIENT: Oh, I forget.
THERAPIST: Oh, that's good, okay. Hi, what I can help you with?
CLIENT: Hi, I'm looking to speak with the manager.
THERAPIST: Okay. I'm the manager what can I help you with?
CLIENT: Hi, my name is Catherine, I'm looking to apply for a job today, I was wondering if you had an application?
THERAPIST: We do have applications. Do you have any experience working in retail?
CLIENT: Yes, I actually have worked at Gap and also Express and Forever 21, a few stores.
THERAPIST: Okay. Let's suppose that I'm actually interviewing you right now. Okay, so you filled out the application and I'm like actually yeah we need some people right away. So what was the reason that you left your last job? (0:28:04.4)
CLIENT: See that's what I always think about before and I'm like what am I going to say, like oh I had anxiety like.
THERAPIST: That's obviously not what you said, right?
CLIENT: Yes. So that's why I always …
THERAPIST: So what are you going to say?
CLIENT: That's another thing that like keeps me because I'm always like what am I suppose to say I left my last two jobs not like directly anxiety but pretty much.
THERAPIST: Well then why don't you a white lie in this case.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What can you say? I started school?
CLIENT: Yeah, that's what I had to focus more on school so.
THERAPIST: And why can, are you still in school?
CLIENT: I am, I just have more time for a job right now.
THERAPIST: Okay. So you have some flexibility?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Okay. How are you with working nights?
CLIENT: Not late nights because I do still have school in the mornings on a few days but flexible hours.
THERAPIST: Okay. And weekends?
CLIENT: Weekends are definitely good. (0:29:01.5)
THERAPIST: Okay. And do you have any letters of reference or anybody who could vouch for you?
CLIENT: Yes, I have my resume.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Who is on your resume?
CLIENT: Well, actually I just have my former employers on my resume so I guess they don't, I have kind of references that are available.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I guess that didn't answer that question but.
THERAPIST: Okay. But you see by knowing everybody has their reasons like sometimes they quit a job because I don't want to work there any more or I wanted a better job that paid more and that's not something you want -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - necessarily tell somebody. Yeah, so thinking up beforehand what you're going to say, you know how to reduce your anxiety.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So you obviously probably weren't nervous.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: With me.
CLIENT: But normally I do I think a lot about just oh my god what if they ask me about my old jobs and I always have like in the back of my head just say school but then I feel like, because I know I'm lying I feel like do they believe them. (0:30:00.4)
THERAPIST: I think I would believe you.
CLIENT: Like I guess they have no reason to question school as obviously is important -
THERAPIST: Uh-hmm.
CLIENT: - to many people.
THERAPIST: I started school, I wanted to concentrate, I wanted to concentrate on my studies.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But now I'm ready to take on more.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I think I said that to my last employer about my job before that so.
THERAPIST: Okay. I think that sounds very good, you know so right now we'll work on just getting out there it doesn't matter what job it is, just as long as you practice, right?
CLIENT: Yep, practice.
THERAPIST: And what are you going to tell yourself for saying this is so uncomfortable I want to get our right now?
CLIENT: Tough, deal with it and you'll be out once it's over.
THERAPIST: It feels uncomfortable -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - but I can handle it?
CLIENT: Yeah, I can.
THERAPIST: I can handle it.
CLIENT: I have before so why not now?
THERAPIST: Yeah. And it's worth it.
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
THERAPIST: It's worth it to do so.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: So you think you can handle that homework?
CLIENT: I think so.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I think, I should. (0:31:01.3)
THERAPIST: How are you going to deal with the roommate stuff?
CLIENT: See how I guess this week goes and I think I'm just going to, since she was so fine about it and I told her I was like I'm going to, you know from now on I don't really care about what happens, like the dishes then, but I'm just going to, you know remind her it's (inaudible - 0:31:21.4).
THERAPIST: Yeah, and you better go looking for jobs today or else -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - you're going to be such a hypocrite.
CLIENT: Oh god, I didn't think about that. But actually it's clean because I did all the dishes last night.
THERAPIST: But you can't do that tonight.
CLIENT: That's true. Tell her not to eat anything. But yeah but I think, I think it'll be okay I'll be able to do them because I think I'll get out there and apply at least to a few places.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Especially since I do live right near a shopping center and is there so many places.
THERAPIST: Yeah, and then we get some people working close to where you live.
CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible - 0:31:58.5).
THERAPIST: And you know they might say well we don't have any availability now but we have one in another store and then - (0:32:04.6)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - I don't know if you wanted and you can check out -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - other places. You know it's tough times to get a job but you never know -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - you're not going to find out unless you look.
CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like it might be easiest for me right now in retail just because they're always having people in and out so.
THERAPIST: Yeah. And I guess you could look at restaurants because you said you did want.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think if I did restaurants I would probably come into the city somewhere.
THERAPIST: You think probably make better money obviously.
CLIENT: Yeah. And there's more, I feel like by me there's not too many restaurants.
THERAPIST: I was thinking of, it's like The Loop though and it goes perpendicular to -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - it's like so many restaurants on that is what I think is The Loop.
CLIENT: There is yeah there's a lot …
THERAPIST: A lot of Greek restaurants and.
CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible - 0:32:57.7) yes because it's beside (inaudible - 0:32:59.6) like then all the restaurants but there are a lot of smaller restaurants. (0:33:04.5)
THERAPIST: Yeah, they're small.
CLIENT: They have bays and stuff, I guess I see a lot of girls my age as hostess at the Café's so they do hire.
THERAPIST: Because a lot of times it's hard to get a job as like a waitress in like a big restaurant because they want somebody who is really experienced, especially in Chicago, but once you get, basically once you say I've been a waitress before then all the other doors open up because.
CLIENT: I know my roommate when she first, like they give her a little attitude because she only had like a month's worth of experience like two years ago as a waitress -
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's like my waitress.
CLIENT: - and they were kind of leery. They were like oh so is everyone around here so yeah they always want experience with that.
THERAPIST: In the end for a restaurant I feel like all they care about is like attractive, you're like (inaudible - 0:33:58.6) that tends to be like oh you're attractive you look like a restaurant waitress -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - you know you seem nice. (0:34:06.8)
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess it's not, they're not looking really for anything spectacular so.
THERAPIST: I feel like (inaudible - 0:34:14.5) as much like looks is such a policy.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So how do you feel if they were judging your looks?
CLIENT: I don't know, I'm more just, that doesn't bother me as much I don't know I don't really.
THERAPIST: It's more the judging of your personality that?
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know why but it just, I'm more worried about that I guess.
THERAPIST: Okay. And what if I was judging your personality during the interview?
CLIENT: I don't know it would make me feel really uncomfortable but.
THERAPIST: You can stand it?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Well, they say oh you seem a little quiet are you going to be able to help a customer?
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm quiet but I enjoy working with customers and helping them out. (0:35:00.3)
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: I'm much better talking with customers (therapist laughing – inaudible - 0:35:03.5). That I could deal with but.
THERAPIST: Well that's good.
CLIENT: Yeah. I am good with the customers so that's at least one thing.
THERAPIST: That's a strength of mine actually even though I'm a little quiet, you know I find people don't find me offensive like sometimes people are annoying in stores.
CLIENT: I feel like most customers, well it depends because when I worked downtown it's completely different but they're just they need your help so it's easier to talk to someone because they need your help but some people just give you an attitude. And it's easier for me to deal with the people in that sitting -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - those type of people then I think it would be like on the street or something.
THERAPIST: It's easier to deal with someone giving you an attitude in the store?
CLIENT: Yeah, then if I was out like or something.
THERAPIST: Why do you think that is?
CLIENT: I don't know, because it's my job maybe so it's kind of like I guess (inaudible - 0:35:54.5) what I have to do maybe that's why I kind of feel a little bit like well this isn't me. (0:36:00.3)
THERAPIST: Maybe you also know that they're not probably mad at you they're just generally annoyed with.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Is there anyway you can think about that? Sometimes if other people are giving you an attitude or seem rude to you, that it might not be you.
CLIENT: Yeah because when I would work in retail I would always see people like that and I always think oh they're just unhappy person they're just I don't know. I guess I should start thinking about that more and just an everyday -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - life.
THERAPIST: I think we should start doing more exercises also, I mean the job is part of your immediate goal.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But maybe having people judge you on the street.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Some of those strangers you'll never see again but it still bothers you to.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I feel like only certain times like sometimes strangers can really bother me but if I'm in like a mind set where I'm just like I don't care like I can just go through my day and like be dressed as like I don't know a bum and not even care but then other times I'm like why is everyone like talking to me, leave me alone, I don't know. (0:37:07.9)
THERAPIST: Okay. Well, I think that you have some good practice, the homework and no washing dishes until you do it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay? And I want you to start thinking more about maybe (inaudible - 0:37:19.1) because I think it's going to help your relationship and especially now that you're looking for a job she might even say something like -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - oh I'm surprised you're looking for a job right?
CLIENT: Uh-hmm.
THERAPIST: Is that likely to happen?
CLIENT: Yeah, any comment regarding someone who doesn't have a job, anything you can think of that's what my friends say to me so that's why I guess I should take it more in like a light matter but I'm working on it.
THERAPIST: Okay. We can talk about that next week.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. This week you're going for the job.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: Okay? And it doesn't matter if you get it, success for you will just to have been going in -
CLIENT: Uh-hmm.
THERAPIST: - talking to somebody.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Even if they are rude to you and even if they say you don't have any experience, even if they say you're dressed like shit why would we hire you, the success for you is just to go in and tolerate the uncomfortableness. (0:38:12.5)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay?
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: The goal is not to get a job.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It would be nice to get a job you can think of it that way, but the goal is, there is no stress that you have to get this job.
CLIENT: Okay. I think that makes it a little bit better especially if I do feel uncomfortable by someone, I don't feel the pressure like oh well too bad.
THERAPIST: (inaudible - 0:38:35.9)
CLIENT: Too soon.
THERAPIST: You don't need this job you've been doing fine without a job.
CLIENT: Uh-hmm.
THERAPIST: It's nice to have a job but you don't need it. The point of this exercise is to just go in -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - and -
CLIENT: Just work on.
THERAPIST: - and work on talking. Talking to strangers and asking for things.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think it has been so long since I really have so it's just.
THERAPIST: When you're in a store like and you're the customer do you have trouble asking for help? (0:39:03.8)
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: You don't feel like you're bothering them?
CLIENT: No, I don't know when I'm in the store it's like I'm different, I don't know I'm just, I'll ask them for help and I guess, I still am like quiet like I'll be okay excuse me like but I also hate to go into stores where they like come up to and they're like hi do you need any help and they like stand right there and that makes me uncomfortable. But I feel like I'm (inaudible - 0:39:29.9) when I'm uncomfortable.
THERAPIST: What about going into like when you go into like Macy's or Bloomingdale's and they like bombard you with like samples of perfume?
CLIENT: I just, I can't stand that, I'll just walk past them and just like. It's weird because I feel like I can walk past like people who are like handing things out, you know like on the streets they're always handing things out, and I'm like oh like I get so annoyed at them. And I only think about them and like how, like oh I just gave them an attitude like I just like, but if it's someone else. (0:40:01.0)
THERAPIST: They don't take it insultingly right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: They've got people doing that everyday.
CLIENT: They don't care and I can't apply that to like other situations I don't know.
THERAPIST: I want you to practice as much as you can talking to strangers. What about those people handing things out and taking it and saying thank you? Would that be annoying for you?
CLIENT: I do that with the kids, like when I see the kids handing it out I'll take one.
THERAPIST: Okay. So that's not something well, I'm going to think of more things that are going to be annoying for you.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay?
CLIENT: I'll start.
THERAPIST: And anything that you can think of that you do, you know let me know.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: If you think of your own activities and think of things that would be.
CLIENT: If I just get out more in general then I'll at least come into contact.
THERAPIST: Are you going to go out this weekend?
CLIENT: I might actually be going to Michigan to visit my friend because she's working up there and she's kind of stuck there for like awhile now that she graduated so.
THERAPIST: That will be fun.
CLIENT: So that will be people I don't know so.
THERAPIST: Yeah, because you'll be hanging out with all her friends and stuff, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. I met two of her friends like a month or so up there and they were really nice so I'm hoping like. (0:41:04.9)
THERAPIST: So
CLIENT: Just comfortable.
THERAPIST: She has invited you up and you just haven't said yes yet.
CLIENT: I said yes and I'm not sure if I can go this weekend or next weekend, she's like my closest friend so it's kind of like whenever I can just tell her the day before that I'm coming.
THERAPIST: What would stop you from going up this weekend?
CLIENT: I'm kind of thinking of going to Joliet, going home, but I'm not sure because my mom is like I haven't seen you in forever, it has only been like a few weeks.
THERAPIST: I think you should go to Michigan because I think home is too comfortable.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's it's like.
THERAPIST: It gets too much of a habit.
CLIENT: Kind of thing.
THERAPIST: So I think it would be good for you to go to Michigan.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Have some fun.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay?
CLIENT: Alright.
THERAPIST: Alright. Well, I'll see you next week. I can't wait to hear about all the job interviews -
