<i>Etiology and Treatment</i>


Studies indicate that problems in sexual
functioning may be quite common
(Spector &amp; Carey, 1990). As early as
1970, Masters and Johnson estimated that
50% of couples in the United States suffered
from a sexual dysfunction (Masters &amp; Johnson,
1970). Other estimates suggest that up to 24%
of the U.S. population will experience a sexual
dysfunction at some point in their lives (Robins
et al., 1984). In 1992, Laumann and colleagues
conducted a study to assess the prevalence and
risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction across
social groups (Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, &amp;
Michaels, 1995). They found that sexual dysfunction
was more prevalent in women (43%)
than in men (31%) and was associated with
characteristics such as age, educational attainment,
poor physical and emotional health,
experiences in sexual relationships, and overall
well-being. Having a sexual problem or dysfunction
can invoke embarrassment, fear,
shame, and feelings of inadequacy. For these
reasons, the number of individuals who suffer
with a sexual dysfunction is often greater than
what reported statistics reflect.


Table 18.1 outlines the current classification
scheme of sexual disorders found in the
DSM-IV (<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders</i>, fourth edition [American
Psychiatric Association, 1994]). Sexual dysfunctions
are further classified into three subtypes:
pain disorders, arousal disorders, and
orgasmic disorders. To understand the etiology
and treatment of sexual disorders, it is
necessary to have some knowledge of the
psychobiology of the human sexual response.

<b>Background and Etiology</b>

<i>
<b>The Human Sexual Response</b>
</i>


Biomedical advances and clinical studies
suggest that for most people, human sexual
functioning proceeds sequentially and rudimentarily
involves a biphasic response that is composed
of (a) <i>tumescence</i>, or the engorgement of
the genitals with blood that leads to erection in
men and vaginal lubrication and swelling in
women, and (b) <i>detumescence</i>, or the outflow
of blood from the genitals following orgasm
(Bancroft, 1995; Herbert, 1996; Schiavi &amp;
Segraves, 1995; Wincze 8t Carey, 1991).
However, the psychobiological mechanisms

[p. <i>360</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00370&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I032&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Masters and Johnson (1970) described a
physiological model of the sexual response
that included four physiological phases:
excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution
(Table 18.2). However, this model failed to
address those patients who reported difficulty
in becoming aroused or who expressed an
aversion to sex (Kaplan, 1977). Subsequently,
a "desire stage" was conceived that was
believed to precede the "excitement" phase
described by Masters and Johnson. Desire
involves a patient's "cognitive and affective
readiness for, and interest in, sexual activity"
(Wincze &amp; Carey, 1991, p. 4).


<i>
<b>Etiological Factors</b>
</i>


Given the complexity of sexual performance,
sexual desire, sexual satisfaction, and
meaning of sexual behavior that is constructed
from dominant culture and beliefs, one must
not rely exclusively on physiological models to
describe or assess sexual functioning (Laqueur,
1990; Tiefer, 1991). Diagnosis and assessment
must include an evaluation of organic causes as
well as psychogenic factors that contribute to,
or occur secondarily to, a sexual dysfunction
(Pollets, Ducharme, &amp; Pauporte, 1999) such as
conflict (Metz &amp; Epstein, 2002), guilt (Walser
&amp; Kern, 1996), depression and other affective
states (Seidman &amp; Roose, 2001), trauma (van
Berlo &amp; Ensink, 2000), and anxiety (Shires &amp;
Miller, 1998). Likewise, principles of learning
and conditioning in regard to the sexual
response must be considered (Lalumiere &amp;
Quinsey, 1998), as should cognitive appraisals
and expectancies about sexual arousal and
desire (Palace, 1995; Weisberg, Brown,
Wincze, &amp; Barlow, 2001), relationship distress
(Metz &amp; Epstein, 2002), and developmental
issues such as age and a person's stage in life
(Avina, O'Donohue, &amp; Fisher, 2000; Bartlik &amp;
Goldstein, 2001; Dennerstein, Dudley, &amp;
Burger, 2001). Many patients develop sexual
dysfunctions as the result of medical conditions
such as spinal cord injuries (Sipski, Alexander,
&amp; Rosen, 2001), kidney disease (Malavaud,
Rostaing, Rischmann, Sarramon, &amp; Durand,
2000), diabetes (Bhugra, 2000), cancer
(Merrick, Wallner, Butler, Lief, &amp; Sutlief,
2001; Shifren et al., 2000), and other chronic
illnesses (Schover, 1989). Finally, medications
prescribed to treat a variety of medical and
psychological conditions can often lead to
reduced sexual desire or other interference with
sexual performance (Gelenberg, Delgado, &amp;
Nurnberg, 2000; Waldinger et al., 2002).

<b>Assessment and Treatment</b>

<i>
<b>Basic Principles of Sex Therapy</b>
</i>


Traditionally, sex therapy is a short-term
therapy designed for the special treatment of
sexual dysfunctions. Sex therapy is a behaviorally
based, systematic protocol designed
to move patients through a series of "graded
experiences, from an avoided, partial, or pleasureless
response to a fully pleasurable
response" (Birk, 1999, p. 525). Contemporary
approaches to sex therapy often address issues
in the patient as well as in his or her partnership
more systemically. Emotional, spiritual,
cultural, affective, cognitive, and social factors
are addressed and evaluated. Thus, effective
treatment of psychogenic sexual dysfunctions
requires knowledge of family systems and
family therapy as well as extensive experience
in working with couples in general.


<i>
<b>Overall Evaluation and Assessment</b>
</i>


During an initial evaluation the clinician will
typically seek demographic information, the
nature and development of the dysfunction, a
psychosexual history, a description of the
patient's current sex life, the partners' perception
of the quality of their relationship, the
degree of psychopathology of one or both partners,
physical health, and the patient's motivation
for and commitment to treatment
(LoPiccolo &amp; Heiman, 1978). The initial evaluation
can seem quite invasive for the patient,
and it is important to inform him or her why
the type of information sought is necessary.
Questions must be specific to ascertain the
nature and degree of dysfunction and to help
delineate between possible organic and psychogenic
causes of the problem. Additional
information that may be sought includes, but is
not limited to, the patient's personality, professional
life, education, sexual development, sexual
values, experiences with other partners,
history of masturbatory behaviors, and attitudes
about pleasure, family life, and religious
background.


<i>
<b>Overall Treatment Approach</b>
</i>


Thoughts, attitudes, and feelings play a
significant role in mediating physiological

[p. <i>362</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00372&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A number of psychosocial interventions are
available to help with sexual difficulties. Perhaps
the most common is sensate focus, which
involves teaching patients and their partners
to engage in intimate physical and emotional
closeness in a gradual nonthreatening manner.
Homework is assigned in which couples engage
in various stages of the protocol. Explicit
instructions are given to couples as to how
to approach each stage of treatment. "Rules" of
engagement are outlined, with some of these
rules prohibiting genital contact during the
earlier phases of the exercise. Modifications
can be made to best address the needs of
the patient and the type of dysfunction being
treated. Inclusion of steps and the duration
of each is left to clinical judgment. An outline
of sensate focus is presented in Table 18.3.


<i>
<b>Female Sexual Dysfunctions</b>
</i>


<i>Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder</i>.
According to Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, and
Michaels (1994), approximately 33% of women
experience a lack of sexual interest at some point
in their lives. From ages 18 to 24 years, about
32.0% of women report some difficulty with
sexual desire; at ages 30 to 34 years, this number
decreases to 29.5%. The largest group affected
is women ages 35 to 39 years (37.6%). Among
women ages 40 to 54 years, the number of
women reporting desire disturbances declines,
only to increase once again after that.


In the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric
Association, 1994), sexual desire disorders fall
into two categories: hypoactive sexual desire
disorder (HSDD), defined as a "deficiency or
absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual
activity" (p. 496), and sexual aversion disorder
(SAD). Diagnosis of HSDD generally
involves clinical judgment as well as corroborating
information from the patient's partner
(Rosen &amp; Leiblum, 1989). It is important to
keep in mind that often a partner with higher
desire becomes the referent for the partner
with lower desire, in which case it may be
indicative of a desire discrepancy as opposed,
to a desire disorder. Clinical judgment must
also take into account interpersonal determinants,
frequency and chronicity of the symptom,
subjective distress, effect on other areas
of functioning, and the person's current life
situation. Some individuals have difficulty in
initiating sexual activity; others are unresponsive
to sexual advances from their partners
(i.e., lack of receptivity). It is important to
determine whether HSDD is global, with the
patient lacking interest in any or all sexual
activity, or situational, with the patient's lack
of desire occurring only with a specific partner
or type of activity.


HSDD can occur as a secondary condition
when other sexual dysfunctions are present
(e.g., anorgasmia in women, ED in men). HSDD
may also result from a number of physiological
or psychological conditions, including other
medical conditions (Phillips &amp; Slaughter, 2000),
stress, substance use, low self-esteem, anhedonia,
hormonal changes, and negative self-evaluation
(Heiman &amp; Meston, 1997;
Morokoff, 1985; Rosen &amp; Leiblum, 1989).
Medication side effects are another possible
cause of reduced desire (Wincze &amp; Carey, 1991).
Finally, a history of sexual abuse or trauma,
abuse, or assault can lead to decreased desire due
to "chronic fears of vulnerability of loss of control,
inability to establish intimate relationships,
or a conditioned aversion to all forms of sexual
contact" (Rosen &amp; Leiblum, 1989, p. 27).

[p. <i>363</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00373&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the assessment of HSDD, frequency of
activity should not be considered, a reliable indicator
of sexual desire. However, initiation is
an important consideration because it serves
as an indicator of female motivation to engage
in sexual behavior (Wallen, 1990). Often, a
patient will engage in frequent coitus or other
sexual activities out of a sense of obligation,
coercion, or an attempt to please or accommodate
his or her partner's wishes and preferences.
Likewise, one must consider that symptoms of
low desire may reflect problems of relationship
intimacy, power differentials, or territoriality in
the relationship (Verhulst &amp; Heiman, 1988).
Masturbatory practices vary, as do cognitive
correlates of desire such as fantasy (Schreiner-Engel
&amp; Schiavi, 1986). Moreover, gender differences
must be taken into account in the
evaluation of cognitive descriptors of desire
(Denney, Field, &amp; Quadagno, 1984; Jones &amp;
Barlow, 1990; McCauley &amp; Swann, 1978,
1980; Person, Terestman, Myers, Goldberg, &amp;
Salvadori, 1989).


A number of treatment strategies are
available to address problems associated
with sexual desire disorder (for a review, see
O'Donohue, Dopke, &amp; Swingen, 1997). These
approaches include (a) psychotherapy (Kaplan,

[p. <i>365</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00375&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Sexual Aversion Disorder</i>. SAD is a more
severe disruption in desire. SAD is characterized
by a "marked aversion to, and active
avoidance of, all genital contact with a sexual
partner" (American Psychiatric Association,
1994, p. 499). The aversion to genital contact
"may be focused on a particular aspect of sexual
experience (e.g., genital secretions, vaginal
penetration) ... [or] revulsion to all sexual
stimuli, including kissing and touching"
(p. 499). This disorder is often accompanied
by poor body image and avoidance of nudity
(Katz, Gipson, &amp; Turner, 1992; Ponticas,
1992). Women with SAD may experience
reactions such as terror, panic, and nausea.
Efforts to cope with the disorder may include
avoidance of sexual contact, substance use,
and neglect of one's personal appearance.
Although SAD and HSDD are distinct, the
two conditions are often related and have
similar causes such as endocrine alterations,
medical conditions, psychological distress,
relationship factors, prior sexual trauma, and
negative learning experiences (Halvorsen &amp;
Metz, 1992).


In treating SAD, it is important to understand
the "approach-avoidance" conflict that
exists in many of these patients (Ponticas,
1992). Given that most causes of SAD are not
physiological, addressing psychological issues
that underlie the disorder is of particular
importance in treatment. In addition to psychotherapy,
systematic desensitization and
vicarious extinction techniques can be used to
reduce or minimize the patient's anxiety and
fear response (Wincze, 1971).


<i>Female Orgasmic Disorder</i>. Anorgasmia is
regarded as the most common sexual dysfunction
in women (Heiman &amp; Grafton-Becker,
1989; Spector &amp; Carey, 1990). Moreover,
approximately 85% to 90% of women report
having orgasms without difficulty; however,
only one third have had an orgasm during
intercourse (Seeber &amp; Gorrell, 2001). In addition,
the incidence of orgasmic difficulty
tends to be higher in single women (Laumann
et al., 1994).


Female orgasmic disorder is characterized
by "a persistent or recurrent delay in, or absence
of, orgasm following a normal sexual excitement
phase" (American Psychiatric
Association, 1994, p. 505). Clinical judgment
is an important factor in diagnosing this condition
given that a woman's orgasmic capacity
must be determined to be less than would
be "reasonable for her age, sexual experience,
and the adequacy of sexual stimulation she
receives" (p. 505). Many women express concern
that something is "wrong with them" if
they do not experience orgasm during intercourse
or if they have multiple or simultaneous
orgasms. Patients need to know that
many women do not reach orgasm during
coitus because penile stimulation is often not
intense or direct enough to produce orgasm.


Women's orgasmic potential and type of
orgasm are variable. Orgasmic capacity has
been associated with sexual assertiveness

[p. <i>366</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00376&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Often, the source of orgasmic difficulty in
women is their own or their partners' lack of
knowledge about the female sexual response and
female genitalia. The problem is often resolved
by helping clients and their partners learn to
extend stimulation and lovemaking beyond
genitally focused sex. Greater sensate exchange
between partners, expanding women's arousal
pattern, directed masturbation, and anxiety
management also can be helpful.


<i>Dyspareunia and Vulvodynia</i>. Estimates of
the prevalence of dyspareunia range from 8.0%
(Osborn, Hawton, &amp; Gath, 1988) to 33.5%
(Glatt,Zinner, &amp; McCormack, 1990). Although
accurate prevalence rates are difficult to determine,
studies have shown that causal attributions
of pain are related to levels of adjustment. For
example, women who cited psychosocial attributions
indicated greater psychosocial distress,
more problems with sexual function, and more
frequent reports of sexual assault as well as lower
levels of marital adjustment (Meana, Binik,
Khalife, &amp; Cohen, 1999).


Pain is a subjective experience. In dyspareunia,
the phenomenology of pain is genital and
associated with intercourse. In some cases,
pain occurs before or after intercourse as
well. In women, "the pain may be described as
superficial during intromission or as deep
during penile thrusting..., [with] symptoms
rang[ing] from mild discomfort to sharp
pain" (American Psychiatric Association, 1994,
p. 511). Vulvodynia refers to pain located
specifically in the vulva. Dyspareunia can be
lifelong or acquired as well as generalized or
situational. Abarbanel (1978) suggested four
phenomenological categories of pain associated
with dyspareunia: (a) perception of a
sharp but momentary pain that varies in intensity,
(b) repeated and intense discomfort,
(c) aching, and (d) intermittent painful pangs
or twinges. A thorough medical examination
must be conducted to rule out physical factors
such as pelvic tumors, hymeneal remnants,
prolapsed ovaries, and scarring that occurs as
a result of either an episiotomy or vaginal
repair (Bancroft, 1995). Hormonal changes that
result from contraceptive use or menopausal
changes can lessen vaginal lubrication and subsequently
cause soreness and irritation during
intercourse or penetration. Once organic causes
of pain are ruled out, psychological factors such
as anxiety, poor body image, religiosity, anger,
and distrust toward the patient's partner should
be investigated.


Psychotherapy is an important element in
the treatment of dyspareunia and should be
approached in a multimodal framework to
examine the patient's (a) behavior (e.g., deficits
and shortcomings in sexual techniques),
(b) affect (e.g., feelings of guilt, shame, and
anger), (c) sensation (e.g., assessment of the
location, type, frequency, and intensity of
pain), (d) imagery (e.g., body image, negative
memories), (e) cognition (e.g., negative self-statements,
dysfunctional beliefs), (f) interpersonal
functioning (e.g., communication,

[p. <i>367</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00377&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Vaginismus</i>. Vaginismus is a relatively rare
disorder characterized by "recurrent or persistent
involuntary contraction of the perineal
muscles surrounding the outer third of the
vagina when vaginal penetration with penis,
finger, tampon, or speculum is attempted"
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994,
p. 513). In some women, thoughts of penetration
alone can create spasms. Contractions
can be mild, creating tightening and discomfort,
or severe, preventing any penetration.
Sexual desire, pleasure, and orgasmic capacity
can be impaired as a result of the disorder.
The patient should, be screened, for potential
organic factors that can contribute to formation
of the disorder such as vaginal hysterectomies
or other surgeries, atrophic vaginitis,
endometriosis, painful hymenal tags, and urethral
caruncle (Lamont, 1978; Tollison &amp;
Adams, 1979). Although many of these conditions
are not directly responsible for vaginismus,
they may be associated with the disorder
indirectly through classical conditioning.


The main objective is to eliminate the "spasmodic
reflexive contraction of the muscles controlling
the vaginal entrance typically through a
series of gradual approximations with the insertion
of increasingly larger dilators" (Leiblum,
Pervin, &amp; Campbell, 1989, p. 113). Use of
graduated rubber or plastic catheters helps to
extinguish the conditioned spasmodic response
via systematic desensitization. The patient or
her partner's fingers can also do insertion. In
addition, it is important that the patient feel in
control of what is happening, and this extends
to her guiding penile entry during coitus. Use of
the female superior position during intercourse
should be suggested because this can help
the patient to maintain control of entry and
movement. Cognitive-behavioral approaches
are also used to challenge underlying thoughts
and beliefs that drive the conditioned fear
response. Psychotherapy can be used to explore
unconscious fears and conflicts that may underlie
the disorder. Therapy should include progressive
relaxation techniques and fantasy
exercises to help alleviate fears of gynecological
exams as well as intercourse.


<i>
<b>Male Sexual Dysfunctions</b>
</i>


<i>Male Erectile Disorder</i>. An estimated 30
million men suffer from ED in the United
States. ED prevalence rates increase to more
than 50% in men ages 50 to 70 years, and ED
occurs in approximately 40% of men with
diabetes (Feldman, Goldstein, McKinlay,
Hatzichristou, &amp; Krane, 1994). In men under
age 35 years, approximately 70% suffer from
psychogenic ED, whereas 85% of men over
age 50 years have organic ED (Weiss &amp;
Mellinger, 1990).


ED has been defined as an inability to
achieve or sustain an erection of sufficient
rigidity or duration to enable satisfactory
sexual performance (American Psychiatric
Association, 1994). Often, ED is associated
with older age (Marumo, Nakashima, &amp;
Murai, 2001). There are different patterns
to ED, with some patients reporting an inability
to obtain an erection from the onset of
sexual activity and others reporting having a
satisfactory erection at the onset of sex but
then losing the erection when attempting
penetration or once penetration is complete.
Particularly when ED is psychogenic, patients
will frequently report having an erection on
awakening or during self-masturbation.
Subtypes include lifelong versus acquired and
generalized versus situational.


To obtain a diagnosis of ED and an accurate
understanding of the etiology of the disorder,
assessment should include a detailed sexual and
medical history, physical examination, and psychological
interview. A medical history and a
physical examination are particularly important
because a number of physiological factors
contribute to the pathophysiology of ED. These

[p. <i>368</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00378&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Other assessment techniques include measurement
of voluntary contractile activity
of the ischiocavernosus muscle (Kawanishi
et al., 2001), penile pharmacotesting with
alprostadil (Aversa et al., 2002), sexual stimulation
penograms (Choi et al., 2002), and
measures of nocturnal penile tumescence
(Basar, Atan, &amp; Tekdogan, 2001).


Several treatment options are available for
organic causes of ED. There are pharmacological
agents such as apomorphine (Altwein &amp;
Keuler, 2001; Mulhall, Bukofzer, Edmonds, &amp;
George, 2001), yohimbine (an alpha-adrenoreceptor
blocker) (Tam, Worcel, &amp; Wyllie,
2001), hormonal treatments, and (most
recently) sildenafil citrate (Viagra). Sildenafil
has been shown to be efficacious in treating ED
in men who suffer from mild, to moderate
depressive illness (Muller &amp; Benkert, 2001;
Seidman, Roose, Menza, Shabsigh, &amp; Rosen,
2001) and spinal cord injury (Sanchez et al.,
2001). Sildenafil has also been shown to be
a safe and effective treatment of ED in both
long- and short-term treatment (Burls, Gold,
&amp; Clark, 2001; Fagelman, Fagelman, &amp;
Shabsigh, 2001; Steers et al., 2001) and has
been found to improve the quality of life in
those patients who use sildenafil (Giuliano,
Pena, &amp; Mishra, 2002). Studies suggest that
sildenafil is particularly effective in cases of
arterial insufficiency and psychogenic causes of
ED (Basar, Tekdogan, et al., 2001) and that
the drug is well tolerated in men over age
65 years (Tsujimura et al., 2002). However,
even when the patient is treated effectively with
sildenafil, it is important to address the
psychosocial factors that either preceded or
developed as a result of ED (Dunn, Croft, &amp;
Hackett, 1999; McDowell, Snellgrove, &amp;
Bond, 2001), given that sexual satisfaction
(Shirai, Takimoto, Ishii, &amp; Iwamoto, 2001),
quality of partnership (Muller, Ruof, Graf-Morgenstern,
Porst, &amp; Benkert, 2001; Paige,
Hays, Litwin, Rajfer, &amp; Shapiro, 2001), and
attitudes toward interventions have important
consequences for the planning and treatment
of sexual problems and partner satisfaction.


Intracavernosal injections are another
treatment option (Richter, Vardi, Ringel,
Shalev, &amp; Nissenkorn, 2001). Intracavernosal
injection of alprostadil (Caverject) has resulted
in reported success rates of 67% to 85%
(Engelhardt, Plas, HÃ¼bner, &amp; PflÃ¼ger, 1998).
When injected directly into the corpus cavernosum,
alprostadil causes the arteriolar
smooth muscle cells to relax. No more than
three injections per week, with a period of
24 hours between administrations, is recommended.
Another option is transurethral
alprostadil. Once the suppository is inserted, it
will first diffuse into the corpus spongiosum
and then into the corpus cavernosum,
whereby the arteriolar smooth muscle relaxes,
resulting in an erection (Viera, Clenney,
Shenenberger, &amp; Green, 1999).


A third option in the treatment of organic
ED is a vacuum erection device. Most devices
work by creating a vacuum in a cylinder placed
over the penis. The vacuum draws blood
into the corpora cavernosa and is trapped by
placing a constricting band at the base of
the penis. Another option is the penile prosthetic
implant. Two types of implants exist: a
semi-rigid silicone implant (Small, Carrion, &amp;

In cases of psychogenic ED, the patient
should be referred for sex therapy, the goal of
which is to restore the patient's potency to the
best level possible. The meaning of impotence
must be explored and transformed into cognitive
and emotional experience because "attentional
processes are highly salient in creating
disruption of genital responsivity" (Beck,
1986, p. 218). Men with psychogenic impotence
often express feelings of inadequacy,
confusion, fear, anger, and shame. Performance
anxiety becomes central in their sexual
experience as they take on a "spectator" role,
watching to see whether their penises will
"perform" at will as expected. Once an erectile
"failure" occurs, the cycle of anxiety, fear,
and shame repeats itself. Self-generated distraction
techniques that use cognitive interference
have been used successfully to help
manage anxiety in patients with ED (Beck,
1986; Beck &amp; Barlow, 1986a, 1986b).


Partners of men with psychogenic impotence
experience their own fears and frustrations.
It is common for a partner to think that
she is somehow responsible for the patient's
difficulties. For example, the partner may think
that she is no longer attractive to the patient or
that the patient is having an affair. Thus, it is
important to include the partner in treatment
so that the relationship can be treated as well
(Leiblum, 2002). Men with psychogenic ED
can overcome the disorder "by understanding
their responses to their dilemmas, integrating
previously unacknowledged feelings, seeking
new solutions to old problems, increasing
communication, surmounting the barriers to
intimacy, and restoring sexual confidence"
(Althof, 1989, p. 239).


Various interventions can be used in the
treatment of psychogenic ED. Behavioral
exercises and cognitive-behavioral therapy can
be used to confront performance anxiety, dispute
irrational beliefs, counteract negative
body image issues, and heighten sensuality.
Sensate focus is a central aspect of treatment
(Table 18.3). In addition to using these behavioral
approaches, the couple needs to be educated
about sexual function and anatomy.
Therapy can also address the destructive sexual
system and dysfunctional relationship
dynamics that inevitably develop in these cases.


<i>Male Orgasmic Disorder</i>. Male orgasmic
disorder is characterized by "persistent or
recurrent delay in, or absence of, orgasm following
a normal sexual excitement phase"
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994,
p. 507). Consideration of this diagnosis must
take into account the patient's age and whether
the amount of stimulation the patient receives
is adequate in duration and intensity. Delayed
ejaculation can occur during lovemaking
and/or during masturbation. Most men with
orgasmic disorder report feeling sufficiently
aroused at the onset of sex. However, coital
thrusting soon feels like a chore rather than a
source of pleasure. Maintaining an erection is
not a problem. Soreness and discomfort due to
prolonged rubbing can aggravate matters and
often makes for greater frustration for both the
patient and his partner. Certain medical conditions
(e.g., spinal injuries, nerve damage, diabetes),
substance abuse, and medications (e.g.,
beta blockers, antidepressants) can cause the
disorder. In fact, drug therapies are the most
common cause of the dysfunction. A thorough
examination by a physician is warranted.
Psychological problems, such as traumatic
childhood experiences, extreme anxiety or
guilt, ridicule from a past partner, and feelings
of anger, can also contribute to the disorder.


A distinction must be made between male
orgasmic disorder and "retrograde ejaculation."
Normally, ejaculation is caused by contraction
of the pelvic muscles, which are behind
the penis and expel semen out of the penis

[p. <i>370</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00380&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A third type of orgasmic disorder is called
anejaculation. In this condition, the patient is
unable to ejaculate at all. Anejaculation can be
caused by spinal injury or duct abnormalities
(Cole, 2002; Goldstone, 2000) or by psychological
factors. A thorough medical examination
is necessary to rule out any physiological
causes, at which point referral to a sex therapist
or psychologist is warranted.


If an orgasmic disorder is caused by medication,
symptoms should remit once the medication
is discontinued or the dose is adjusted.
In the case of retrograde ejaculation, oral medications
are available that can help to contract
bladder neck muscles. Psychotherapy can help
by giving the patient "permission" to concentrate
on his own pleasure as well as by examining
underlying psychological factors that
may be contributing to the problem.


<i>Early or Premature Ejaculation</i>. Despite
its common occurrence, it is difficult to estimate
the frequency of premature ejaculation (PE).
Estimates have ranged from as low as 4% (Metz,
Pryor, Abuzzahab, Nesvacil, &amp; Koznar, 1997)
to as high as 36% (Nettelbladt &amp; Uddenberg,
1979). It is estimated that approximately 25% of
men report having an unsuccessful first intercourse
experience, with the most common reason
being that ejaculation occurs before vaginal
penetration (McCarthy, 1989). The DSM-IV
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994)
defines PE as the "persistent or recurrent onset of
orgasm and ejaculation with minimal sexual
stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration
and before the person wishes it" (p. 509).
Definitions of PE vary, and this is reflected in
experimental and clinical research (Rowland,
Cooper, &amp; Schneider, 2001).


When considering a diagnosis of PE, it is
important to take into account the patient's
age, novelty of the sexual experience or partner,
and frequency of sexual activity. Relationship
stress, anger at one's partner, anxiety about
intimacy, and low frequency of intercourse are
other possible causes of PE. Assessment of PE
should include an investigation of neurological
conditions, acute physical illness, physical
injury, and medication side effects (Metz &amp;
Pryor, 2000). It is also important to determine
whether early ejaculation occurs during masturbation
and whether it is partner specific.


It is helpful to understand the physiology
of the male orgasm to better understand PE.
Ejaculation occurs as a result of many different
physiological events. Many young men
think that orgasm and ejaculation are the
same when in fact the two are related but separate
processes. It is possible for men to have
an orgasm without ejaculating (dry orgasm),
just as it is possible to experience a partial
ejaculation without the sensation of orgasm.


Early in sexual development, masturbation
is often practiced in a rapid, intense, and goal-oriented
fashion. As a result, the "adolescent
male focuses only on penis stimulation and is
intent on reaching orgasm and the associated
few seconds of intense pleasure" (McCarthy,
1989, p. 145), and this is counter to the process
of learning ejaculatory control. Feelings
of guilt, anxiety, shame, and/or fear of being
caught may contribute to the problem.
Eventually, a combination of high anxiety and
sexual excitement can create a pattern of early
ejaculation, which is often made worse by the
tendency of the patient to self-monitor his
orgasmic response. Thus, an important component
of treatment is teaching the patient to
experience masturbation and intercourse as a
more sensual, pleasure-focused, and "whole
body" experience.


Orgasm in males is a two-phase process
consisting of the emission phase and the ejaculatory
phase. Emission is the movement of
semen into the urethra. Expulsion is the
propulsion of semen out of the urethra at
orgasm. A reflex of pelvic floor muscles that

A second method of intervention is the use
of the "squeeze technique," which involves
stimulation to the penis until the patient is
close to ejaculation. Just prior to ejaculation,
the patient or his partner places his or her
hand just below the head of the penis and
squeezes hard enough to cause partial loss of
the patient's erection. This technique is
meant to help the patient become aware
of sensations that precede orgasm and to
then control and delay orgasm on his own.
This technique progresses from manual stimulation
to motionless intercourse and eventually
to intercourse with movement.

[p. <i>375</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00385&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />


Drug therapy can also be effective. Low
doses of antidepressant medications such as
Zoloft, Anafronil, and Prozac are often used
because of their sexual side effects that
include the prolongation of orgasm. More
recently, topical agents such as anesthetics
and herbal medications have been investigated
as a possible treatment option (Choi
et al., 1999, 2002; Morales, 2000).

<b>Conclusions</b>

The field of sexual science has advanced considerably;
however, the conceptual framework
that guides the practice of sex therapy has traditionally
been, and continues to be, rooted in
biological science. A failure to broaden our
understanding and integration of individual,
relational, spiritual, and psychosocial factors
that may contribute to the problem at hand
compromises our effectiveness in helping
those who struggle with issues pertaining to
sex and sexuality. Treatments have continued
to be more technologically or pharmacologically
advanced. Granted, sex therapy can be
credited for its ability to treat sexual problems
quickly and effectively; however, the goal
of most approaches is performance based.
By shifting the traditional behavioral or cognitive-behavioral
approaches "to one that
moves beyond behavior and communication
to personal growth in relationship, we discover
new horizons in human sexual potential"
(Kleinplatz, 2001, p. 190). An important
factor in sex therapy is to help guide individuals
in exercising greater personal agency over
their relational needs as well as their erotic
potential. Interventions should be geared
toward treating the individual as a whole,
not simply as a malfunction in biological
equipment.

<b>Case Study</b>

"Reggie," age 30 years, and "Marsha," age 27 years, sought therapy with a presenting
complaint of marital discord. The partners stated that their marriage of 2 years was
already in trouble and that therapy was their "last resort." Both Reggie and Marsha
said that they loved one another and did not want to separate or pursue a divorce.
Neither was married before. The partners had no children but expressed that having
children was something they would like to do in the future. Marsha was in the third
year of her doctoral program in education. Reggie was currently working two part-time
jobs while searching for employment as a data operations manager. Reggie had
his B.S. degree but had "no desire to go back to graduate school."


The partners agreed that over the past 8 months their relationship had become
more and more strained. Marsha expressed aggravation with what she termed
"Reggie's lack of motivation in seeking stable employment." Marsha was feeling
extremely pressured with graduate school, and although she earned a small income by
teaching, the couple was having to rely on school loans as its main source of support.
Reggie disagreed with Marsha's assessment of his job search efforts. He maintained
that Marsha's anger was due to her desire to start a family and that she interpreted his
"lack of motivation" as an indicator that his desire for children was not as great as
hers. As the assessment continued, more information was gained about the partners'
respective developmental histories, family lives, family compositions, and medical conditions.
Neither had any past psychiatric history. Both were occasional "social"
drinkers, with no history of substance abuse. Neither partner smoked.


When asked about previous relationships, Reggie stated that he had been
engaged at age 22 years but that his fiancÃ© had called off the wedding. Since that
time, he dated and had sexual relationships with several women until he began
dating Marsha 3 years ago. Marsha dated in high school. She had two long-term
relationships; one lasting 2Â½ years and the other lasting 6 years. The 6 year relationship
was with her "high school sweetheart" and began when Marsha was age
17 years. The other relationship took place with a man she met in college when
Marsha was age 24 years. Reggie and Marsha had experience with sex prior to
their marriage. Reggie claimed that he found sex pleasurable but that he recently
had trouble maintaining an erection. He stated that he had less interest in sex. He
denied any past erectile difficulties. In contrast, Marsha suffered pain with intercourse
that worsened over time. She began having pain at age 23 years. Marsha
described the pain as a "sharp stab high up inside me" that occurred after entry
and during intercourse. Marsha was recently referred to a urologist, who told her
that one reason for her pain was that her urethra was situated very close to her
vagina, and this could create abdominal pain during intercourse, particularly during
orgasm. She was given an antispasmodic medication. Marsha complained
about using the medication because it had to be taken with a lot of water several
hours prior to intercourse.

[p. <i>372</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00382&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />


Marsha and Reggie were seen individually for one session. In the session
with Marsha, she stated that she is able to lubricate without difficulty and can
experience orgasm during oral sex and masturbation. She also reiterated her
suspicion that Reggie might not want children after all. She expressed feeling
angry and betrayed. Marsha also described herself as "focused and intense"
and stated that Reggie tends to be much more passive in the relationship, causing
Marsha to feel as though she has to be "the responsible one." Marsha
reported that another source of discord was Reggie's avoidance of conflict.
Marsha insisted that Reggie will "tell me what I want to hear" rather than what
he really thinks.


In the session with Reggie, he disclosed that he was not ready to have children
and felt great pressure from Marsha to "get his act together" so that the couple will
be in a better financial position to start a family. Reggie expressed that he moved
across the country and left a good-paying position so that Marsha could attend
graduate school. He felt resentful that Marsha "seems to forget that." Reggie stated
that since his erectile difficulties began, he has been able to maintain an erection on
some occasions during masturbation. He has also awakened with an erection periodically.
Reggie stated that he rarely initiates sex. When Marsha initiates sex, he
tells her that he is tired or not in the mood.


Reggie and Marsha had a number of relational issues that needed to be
addressed in therapy before sex therapy would become the focus of treatment.
During the first month of treatment, the couple's relationship was the focus of therapy.
Reggie and Marsha were asked not to engage in sexual activity during this
time. They were encouraged to show affection and be close if and when they were
comfortable with doing so. As the partners' relationship began to improve, they
began spending more time with each other, reported enjoying each other's company
more, and were expressing more affection toward one another. Working on
their relationship in general helped to move them to greater nonsexual intimacy,
and this is often an important step in sex therapy. Despite the request not to do so,
the couple attempted intercourse twice before sex therapy began. Each time, Reggie
was unable to maintain his erection. Marsha complained that she was still finding
the experience painful. It is common for couples to "break the rules" during treatment
and to engage in sexual intercourse or other forms of genital contact. Thus,
it is important to let the couple know that unsuccessful attempts are a frequent and
"normal" occurrence so as to avert further setbacks.


Reggie had expressed feeling upset with himself. Marsha admitted that she
would become frustrated and angry when "sex didn't work." Reggie was experiencing
interfering thoughts prior to and during sexual relations. He admitted feeling
"like less of a man" since his problem began. He readily became worried about
the quality and duration of his erection as well as images of Marsha's displeasure,
disappointment, and anger. These thoughts would lead to greater anxiety and
depression.

[p. <i>373</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00383&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />


It was important to work with Reggie to help him restructure his thoughts and
focus on thoughts that would facilitate feeling pleasure rather than those that
would inhibit his sexual function. Once Reggie was better able to establish a positive
sexually facilitating thought process, he was ready to proceed with sensate
focus. During this time, Marsha's fear that she was somehow responsible for her
husband's lack of sexual interest, and the subsequent feelings of inadequacy and
frustration, were explored. This was an important component in assessing Marsha's
cognitive process. Misunderstandings on the part of the partner can sabotage treatment.
Educating the couple about ED helped to alleviate some of Marsha's fears
and resentment. The couple also had to be educated about sensate focus and why
certain restrictions were warranted during the intervention.


Prior to beginning sensate focus, couples should be told to assert and protect
themselves during each session. Self-assertion involves the expression of phrases
such as "I would like you to..." and "Why don't you..." Examples of self-protective
phrases would include "I don't find that pleasing" and "Please touch me
somewhere else." A gentle removal of a partner's hand can also serve this purpose.
One reason for this is that partners need to realize that likes and dislikes can be
communicated without personalizing one another's statements. A formal agreement
is made between the partners to ban attempts at intercourse or other genital
contact during early stages of the program. This agreement removes the pressure
to "succeed" or perform. Goals of sensate focus include (a) learning to touch one's
partner for <i>one's own</i> pleasure, (b) relaxing when being caressed and using a protective
statement or gesture when one finds the touch unpleasant, (c) learning to
recognize when one is "spectatoring," (d) recognizing how nice it is to touch and
be with one's partner, (e) recognizing how nice it is to be touched, and (f) becoming
more acutely aware of what one is feeling physically and emotionally during
the session.


Reggie and Marsha began sensate focus treatment that, in their case, lasted
approximately 3 months. Throughout the treatment process, it was necessary to
monitor the partners' communication with one another regarding both sexual and
nonsexual matters. It was also important to check out the couple's comfort levels
during the duration of treatment and to attend to any interfering thoughts or compliance
problems that surfaced during the intervention period. Reggie and Marsha
also were instructed to conduct their "sessions" in an environment that was free of
distractions and conducive to facilitating an erotic experience. This meant that they
also needed to schedule their sessions when they had adequate time to be together.
Relational issues and the general quality of the couple's relationship continued to
be an integral part of therapy.


Table 18.3 outlines the progressive stages of sensate focus therapy. The couple
was to spend at least 30 minutes together, three times per week. As Marsha and
Reggie approached the fifth stage of sensate focus, which involved vaginal containment
without thrusting, certain modifications had to be made to try to alleviate

[p. <i>374</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00384&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Eventually, Reggie and Marsha were able to resolve their sexual difficulties.
Treatment success was due in large part to the partners' commitment to the therapeutic
process, their resolve to work through their marital and relational issues, and
their compliance with the sensate focus intervention. They were seen approximately
6 months after the termination of therapy for a follow-up visit. No problems were
noted at that time.
