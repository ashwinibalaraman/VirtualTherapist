BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Thanks.  Sorry about that.  So tell me about the Israelis.
<b>PT:</b> You know, it is just they're very young, stubborn and, and even though you demonstrate to them that they'd be better off, you know, with some flexibility, they just don't want to get there from here.
<b>DR:</b> So how, well, did you alter your approach with them or is it the same or -
<b>PT:</b> Well, you know, that is the other part of the frustration is that when you go eyeball to eyeball with them like I was in [DEIDENTIFIED], everybody agrees.  Then you leave and they revert back to -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, so face to face they saw your point of view, but then -
<b>PT:</b> Right.  But then it is like, well, we thought it over and we, you know -
<b>DR:</b> So you have to do it their way basically.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  But things are kind of sucking for me in general.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> You know, I'm getting, I'm getting a lot of it, you know.  I'm having a lot of issues with work.  Financially, I'm a fucking disaster.
<b>DR:</b> You're what?
<b>PT:</b> I'm a disaster financially.
<b>DR:</b> What is, what is happening there?  What is going on?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, you know, you know, I'm broke.  I'm always broke, and every time I think I'm going to get ahead, something happens, you know.
<b>DR:</b> What happened recently?
<b>PT:</b> Um, [NAME OTHER], uh, had the Chrysler 300M.  There was a crack in the radiator hose so the coolant fluid leaked out, but he kept driving it.
<b>DR:</b> He didn't know?
<b>PT:</b> Until he blew the engine -
<b>DR:</b> He didn't know?
<b>PT:</b> He wasn't paying attention to the gauge.  Blew the engine.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.  So you scrapped the car?  You going to replace the engine?
<b>PT:</b> I had to scrap it.  There was no way.  In fact, the cost to replace would be -
<b>DR:</b> Like a new car.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So he doesn't have a car now?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So how does he get to work and -
<b>PT:</b> He doesn't work.
<b>DR:</b> He doesn't work.
<b>PT:</b> Well, you know, it is just things are black all over.
<b>DR:</b> What about support systems?  You have anybody?  You know, like a girl that is back in the picture or nothing like that?
<b>PT:</b> You know, I got nothing going there.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.  You're not, or have you had any self destructive thoughts or feelings?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm between a rock and a hard place on that anyway.
<b>DR:</b> What do you mean?
<b>PT:</b> Well, if it was just me, I, that'd be one thing, but, you know, we've talked about what that would do my kids.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I can't, you know, I can't do that to them because of what I may, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  You're going to leave them with a legacy of [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Especially your daughter, both your daughters.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And actually, your boys are dependent on you anyway.
<b>PT:</b> I'd say.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'm just, you know, I'm just literally every way I turn, I'm fucked.
<b>DR:</b> You don't look forward to anything then?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I'd like to go to sleep and wake up about a year from now.  I just, you know, I don't know.  I mean, I can't catch a break.
<b>DR:</b> How do you spend your weekends when you're home?
<b>PT:</b> When I'm by myself?
<b>DR:</b> Well, both.  Your daughter comes every other week now?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Do you look forward to her coming?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do, but, you know, um, you know, she has got friends and things that she wants to do.
<b>DR:</b> And what do you do when you're alone?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I mean, you know, a lot of domestic stuff.
<b>DR:</b> You sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Sleep, um, you know, try and catch up.
<b>DR:</b> Is it hard to get out of bed in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How do you sleep at night?
<b>PT:</b> Intermittently.  Perhaps sleep for 2 or 3 hours and get up and go to the bathroom or whatever and walk around a little bit, and go back to bed.
<b>DR:</b> What do you think about in the middle of the night?
<b>PT:</b> Um, you know, it is always some, something that sucks.  I mean, you know -
<b>DR:</b> Negative thoughts.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I mean, it is problems or issues that I've got to deal with.  I mean, I really don't have any, I mean, I mean, other than, you know, my kids are doing okay, the 2 youngest ones, even though I don't see my [AGE] that much.  Um, I really don't have anything that is good news, you know.  I think, you know, the, the financial stress is probably the worst.  So -
<b>DR:</b> I mean, you can't make things meet, or are you're making ends meet or no?
<b>PT:</b> Well, what the problem is that, you know, I run in the red on months that I just get my salary in.  And then when I get my bonus or my commissions, you know, I catch up.  And then I run in the red again.  It is like a, I'm like a gerbil on one of those wheels.  I'm running, I'm running at full speed, but I never get anywhere.
<b>DR:</b> Are they trying to cut your commissions again or trying to, I know they did that a couple of years ago.
<b>PT:</b> No, not really.
<b>DR:</b> They're leaving them where they are.
<b>PT:</b> They've cut, they've, their cuts have been more like, you know, well, I guess, it has impacted me, I mean, you know, and the insurance benefits and -
<b>DR:</b> They've cut those?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, like, you know, I used to get, you know, when I paid, I, I, I pay 155 or whatever, I used to get like $120 back.  Now, I pay $155.  I get $65 back.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  They've cut it in half.
<b>PT:</b> My, you know, all the different prescriptions I have, you know, I do the mail order [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.
<b>PT:</b> But it is still like, um, it has gone from maybe I would spend 200 bucks a month in copays.
<b>DR:</b> That much?  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> In, under the old plan.  Now, it is like, um, 4 or 500.
<b>DR:</b> Four or 500?  Wow.
<b>PT:</b> With, and that is just the copays.  And it is not just you because, you know, I got the diabetes stuff from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> That Zyprexa is real expensive.  Did they increase the copay on that one, or -
<b>PT:</b> The problem is, you know, I'm not, I'm, I almost feel like I'm an addict.  If I don't, if I mix, if I don't take any of the right mix, it fucks me up.
<b>DR:</b> What happens?
<b>PT:</b> Well, like if I don't take the Zyprexa, you know, it is, uh, I get the dry heaves.  I, you know -
<b>DR:</b> Anxious.
<b>PT:</b> Very anxious.
<b>DR:</b> You notice you don't sleep with that.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  But I can't take the Zy, like when I have an anxiety attack, that is what I want to talk to you about.  I can't take the Zyprexa because then I get sleepy -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know, and I, and I need to be able to deal with that somehow.
<b>DR:</b> So your anxiety is increasing?
<b>PT:</b> Dramatically.  I, I don't know what the difference is between Xanax and Zyprexa.
<b>DR:</b> That is a big difference.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Xanax is a minor tranquilizer and Zyprexa is a major tranquilizer.  The minor tranquilizers are highly addicting.  I mean, your history, I'd hate to give you something like, I mean, Xanax is a very highly addicting drug.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I mean, I'm open to options, but, you know, I took, I, I, I was having a bad time down in [DEIDENTIFIED], and a buddy of mine said -
<b>DR:</b> Gave you Xanax?
<b>PT:</b> And he, he had, you know, and he gave me like a 2 mg pill.
<b>DR:</b> Of Xanax?  And you liked it?
<b>PT:</b> It helped me out.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  The problem is, if I put you on that on a regular basis, you'll get, you're get dependent on it.  And you'll, you'll really have more problems.  Um, what else could we use that would reduce your anxiety and not make you sleepy?  I'd much rather stay with a major tranquilizer because there is no addiction potential with it.  I mean, there is Klonopin, which you've taken before.  The, the Xanax was stronger, right?  Yeah, that, like I say, is the most potent drug in that class.  It is the benzo class, the Valium class.  But it is the most highly addicting.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I mean, I was thinking maybe, you know, not, I, I don't need, I don't need, you know, a pill a day.  I need maybe 10 a month.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, the problem is you take it, and you're going to want more, and you, that is how this drug works.  I mean, you take it, and then you're going to need it because you get rebound from it.  It works, then it wears off, and you know, you lose the benefit.  And then what happens is you have to make a, become at a level of anxiety control with the Xanax, and if the Xanax drops, then the anxiety increases.  So you're anxious just because you're not taking the Xanax.  That is what the addicting drugs are like.  So, I mean, I'm really, with your history, I'm just really nervous to use that class of drugs.  Um, are there any others we can use?  There is an extended, long acting Xanax that they've come out with that doesn't have the same drop off and rebound effect.  Maybe I can give you that, and we can try it.  It is a, it is a much more gradual -
<b>PT:</b> Give it a try.
<b>DR:</b> It is the same compound, but it is basically extended as to how it is released.  But, you know what I mean, you only took one or did he give you several of these?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I just took one.  That is all I needed.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  I mean, I can try this, but like I say, please do it sparingly because, you know, but this new formulation doesn't seem to have the same dependency build up, but it is still Xanax.  You can try it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, do you need refills on anything else or -
<b>PT:</b> Just the Adderall.  Oh, and I need -
<b>DR:</b> The Adderall came out, you know, with the generic.  Now, you're on the XR?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm on, uh, 20 -
<b>DR:</b> XR.  They have a generic that just came out.
<b>PT:</b> Good.
<b>DR:</b> So that'll save you a little money if you want that, so -
<b>PT:</b> Um, I need, um, the, uh, 90 day, um, um, Viagra.
<b>DR:</b> Viagra?  Viagra -
<b>PT:</b> But you don't have any Viagra so -
<b>DR:</b> You don't mean Viagra.  That is for sex.
<b>PT:</b> Well, right, but I mean -
<b>DR:</b> You don't have a -
<b>PT:</b> If I meet someone and I want to have sex, I, I can't, you know, call you up and say, "I'll be right by."
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING] you could.  No.  But 90 pills -
<b>PT:</b> No.  Not 90 pills.  I, I need maybe, you know, 10 or 15.
<b>DR:</b> Are you serious?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, I'd like to have, I don't want to have to call you if I, I mean -
<b>DR:</b> Were you anticipating meeting somebody or -
<b>PT:</b> Well, there is somebody I'm meeting Sunday night.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, really?  How did you, how are you going to meet her?
<b>PT:</b> We've been emailing for -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, really?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Where is she from?
<b>PT:</b> Poland.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, really?  I like the Polish.  Yeah.  How old is she?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?  You know anything about her?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, you know, we've been e-mailing and it is a struggle for me because I've been so down and -
<b>DR:</b> Maybe she will cheer you up.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, do you, did you talk to her on the phone?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel uplifted when you talk to her?
<b>PT:</b> A little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Is she orig, how long she been in this country?
<b>PT:</b> Um, since she was a teenager.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, so she is Americanized then.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she is actually a citizen.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that is, just Polish heritage then.
<b>PT:</b> Her family came over in the '50s.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, when she was born.  No.  She was -
<b>PT:</b> Or in the '60s, I'm sorry.
<b>DR:</b> So she was born there and came over here.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And she is single or married?  Well, not married.
<b>PT:</b> Divorced.
<b>DR:</b> Divorced.  Great.  What does she do?
<b>PT:</b> Um, she is a computer programmer.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, so she is a bright girl.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> I, I, I just don't have that connection yet.  You know, we'll see what happens.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you haven't met her yet, so, you see pictures of her though?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You like pretty women.  Is she pretty or, you always like pretty [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, who doesn't like pretty women?
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  That is true.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, like give me the ugliest one you got.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> So, um, yeah, I mean, I think, you know, she is attractive.  But, yeah, until I see her in person, but, you know, that is part of my struggle is, um, you know, I want to be upbeat and, you know, put energy in, but, you know, I'm feeling so drained from everything else.
<b>DR:</b> The other thing too about Xanax too.  Xanax has some depressive properties too.  You know, it is a good antianxiety agent, but if you, if you take it on a regular basis, you're going to feel more depressed.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I know.  I, I don't want to take it on a regular basis.  The last thing I want to do is -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, let me give you, I'll give you ten pills so that it is -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Just to see what it does, and you can tell me.  But if it starts making you feel, you're depressed to begin with.  If you feel more depressed [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, I'll give you the Viagra though.  I mean, that won't hurt you.  You're blood pressure is okay, right?
<b>PT:</b> One twenty six over 80.
<b>DR:</b> That is good.  That is good.  All right.  You don't take medicine for blood pressure, do you?
<b>PT:</b> What is that?
<b>DR:</b> Do you take medicine for blood pressure?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So it is just naturally 126 [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But you don't drink anymore.
<b>PT:</b> Don't drink, and -
<b>PT:</b> Hi.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Just charge 155.  Okay?
<b>DR:</b> Could I put [PATIENT NAME] down for the Adderall or?
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> And I was giving you 90 of the 20 mg?
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Um, well, 3 a day times, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And we'll try the generic, yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Sure.  What time is it?
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And you're okay with the other things?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But you need, uh, what did I give you?  Ninety days, uh, what dose of, 50 or -
<b>PT:</b> What?
<b>DR:</b> The Viagra.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Fifteen pills.  And then the last 1 is the Xanax -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> XR.  [NAME OTHER], is the Xanax XR or ER?  I think it is XR, right?
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> It's just been so long since I wrote it.
<b>DR:</b> Do we have like coupons or something?  Do you want the 2 mg or [INAUDIBLE]?  Ten pills.
