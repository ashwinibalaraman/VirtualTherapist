MY story so far has been that of an attack of mental
illness--a sudden ‘confusional state’ such as, theoretically
anyway, might occur in a period of overstrain.
Though it is unusual for such to occur in someone who,
at the age of 47, had previously enjoyed good, indeed
excellent, mental health.


Had I nothing further to say there would be little
occasion to proceed with this book. For anything which
I have to say about mental illness alone, from a patient's
point of view, or the treatment of mental illness, has been
better said by my esteemed friend, John Custance, in
his excellent books "Wisdom, Madness and Folly", and
"Adventure into the Unconscious".


There is, however, a good deal more to say.


Of the several peculiar features which this illness of
mine showed, the most peculiar of all was that it was
shared, as so many of the joys and sorrows of our life
together have been shared, by my dear wife, Betty.


Betty was upset. I still hold Dr. Dum's certificate
dated a week or two subsequent to our joint illness to
the effect ‘Mrs. Johnson has now recovered from her
nervous upset consequent on her husband's illness.’


‘Nervous upset’--a term, alas, sadly lacking in
scientific precision. For Betty was not only upset, she
was very upset indeed.


Here we are, for instance, on the Sunday morning,
the day prior to my admission to hospital, sitting bolt
upright, side by side, in our double bed in the familiar

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The seeker after medical truth might well put the
following proposition: if one person (the writer of this
story) had such paranoiac suspicions for these to be
regarded as evidence of unsound mind to warrant
Certification (see Appendix I), what degree qualified the
holder of identical symptoms to be classified merely as
‘upset’?


The course of Betty's behaviour at that time endows
this medical equation with certain nebulous qualities.


For Betty was very upset indeed.


For here she was again on this same Sunday morning
of which I speak. Our acute anxiety had passed off and
we had had breakfast. But we had hardly finished this
when here was my poor wife sitting in the chair opposite
to me, winking her eye in the oddest fashion that you
ever saw. To this I took strong exception. She replied
by starting to tell me her own fears:


"Christiane isn't really dead," said Betty (Christiane
my first wife, was killed in the London blitz of May
10th/11th, 1941). "She's still alive. They've disguised
her as someone else and are going to bring her back."


Even I was not so far gone as that!


"Nonsense!" I said.


But suddenly it occurred to me that I had, after all,
no positive proof of Christiane's death. I had had in

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All that Sunday Betty and I shared the same dreadful
sense of foreboding. Betty's acute suspicions of those
around us were, if anything, worse than mine. In the
evening, following an outbreak of intense excitement
which brought the doctor in, I went into a drowsy state
and was resting peacefully on our bed. This spell of
rest was interrupted by Betty, who suddenly gave a cry
of terror and rushed across the room to seize a golf club--
intended, so I later learnt, as a protection against some
imagined adversary. I did not stop to ask questions,
however, just then. This ordinary hotel bedroom, which
we had occupied at intervals for years, seemed no place
for either of us with these odd things happening in it.


We both rushed down to the lower floor where we
installed ourselves in the room with the four-poster bed
which was the feature of this old hotel where we were
staying. Here we stayed for the remainder of the night.
As I beat about, trying in just such manner as I have
previously described, to do the right thing and bring
the situation under control, here was Betty once more
winking her eye rather after the manner of an Eastern
dancing girl and she too had to be kept under control.
I did this by fixing her with my gaze and making her
repeat slowly after me:


"Nice ladies--do--not wink--their eyes. Nice ladies
--do--not wink--their eyes."


This was successful in getting Betty over her winking
turn. Now, however, she went back to bed and, instead
of winking herself, she began to see the <i>Laughing
Cavalier</i> on the opposite wall winking at her.


"For heaven's sake, take that picture down. Take
that picture down," shouted Betty. And the picture
had to come down.


Yes, Betty was upset.

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But it is not for me to continue--for all this may well
be put down merely to the fabrications of my own excited
imagination.


Let my witnesses take up the story. For though doubtless
I was, to all intents and purposes, as mad as a hatter,
I had been gifted none the less with the unusual prescience
to surround myself with witnesses as soon as I
felt that the situation was going awry. My brother-in-law,
Ken, and his wife, had at my invitation come to
stay at the hotel: there was, too, my brother in-law, Eric:
and in addition my good friend, Ivor, who only just
previously had joined his business fortunes to mine.
That is four, apart from any other minor characters in
the drama, who witnessed all these happenings.


Here is the letter given me by my brother-in-law,
Ken, shortly afterwards, which I bring in as an integral
part of my story.


'From K. P.


2.12.50.


'My dear Donald,


'In furtherance to our conversation of the 30th I
thought I would put on paper matters relating to one
or two incidents that happened on the Sunday and
early Monday morning of October 14th and 15th,
at ----. As you know, things were quite out of the
ordinary on Sunday evening and you and Betty were
both in an overwrought state probably due to lack of
sleep, and having eaten so little, owing to both of
you having the deep-seated thought that you were
being drugged and poisoned.


'The evening passed with a visit by Dr. Dum who
left you some little phials of medicine for you to
administer yourself, apparently to make you sleep,

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

'As the evening passed, you and Betty were both
endeavouring by your own efforts to sleep, but that
seemed impossible. Ivy and myself were in your room
for some considerable time and you seemed to be
comforted by our presence. Betty produced a knife
from her handbag and gave it to me telling me to take
possession of it, as the old lady had left it in your
room and she seemed very upset why it should have
been left there.


'Ivy put the three children to sleep about 7.30.
When she came back to your room I left to get you a
bottle of beer from the Kings Arms to slake both your
thirsts because you both said you were so dry and
parched. We both left you to have something to eat in
our room on the next landing. Ivy asked Ivor to
stay with you both for a while while we were eating.
Ivor came to our room for something or other when
there was a loud scream. You and Betty came running
downstairs on to our landing. You both barged
into our room where the kiddies were sleeping, saying
you felt safe with the presence of the children. Seemingly
you both thought someone had come into your
room while no one was with you.


'After that, you would not return to your own bedroom
but went into the room where the old Four
Poster bed was. You both had queer notions that
the pictures were winking at you and at this time
Betty seemed very funny about the eyes and she
seemed to think that there were Chinese and Japanese
figures on the wall, even to such an extent that you
both would not stop in the room.



[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

'Dr. Dum came again at 10.30-11 p.m. and he
tried to administer some sleeping drug in various
drinks which we had brought you. However, it was
no use because of this feeling of yours that you were
being drugged for some ulterior motive. Dr. Dum
stopped till about 10 a.m. Monday morning, I
should think, within hearing of where you both were.


'It was decided that Ivy, Eric, Ivor and myself
should stay with you. Ivor went to bed about three
a.m. All during the night you kept remarking that
you thought there was opium or some drug being
burned in the stove--and that your throats were so
parched and dry. About 6 a.m. you had a turn of this
hypnotizing power over Betty and she repeated what
you said time and time again and then you appeared as
if you were going to strike her when she seemed to
break away from this power at this juncture.


'I rang up Dr. Dum on Monday morning and told
him that he should come along and do something
about you and Betty, because at that time I thought
that someone might get hurt. He apparently made
arrangements for your removal to the hospital and he
seemed to think that Betty would be all right.


'I went with you to the hospital and Betty was
there as well. However, they took her into another
room and you warned the people, whoever they may
have been, that you wanted an independent doctor
and you intended to have your rights; and told them
that they were not dealing with an insane man, but a

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

'Well, Betty was eventually taken to the G's sometime
after 2 p.m. where she had a sound sleep for
four hours with the aid of a sleeping tablet. Dr. Dum
was again called to see her and he was again of the
opinion that with some sleep and in the home of folks
that she could trust she would rally in about three
days or, as he said "go the other way". I then took
Betty to our home and gave her the nursing that she
needed. We had to stop up with her for three nights,
she being afraid to be left on her own, but she soon lost
that queer yellow grey pallor and funny eyes. When
she arrived home, Ivy's mother's first remarks were
"That girl's been drugged". From my point of view
and my wife's we were both of the same opinion all
the way through. Dr. Dum remarked that he would
not sign Betty away because he had never heard of
a dual case like this and although he was pressed he
would not do it.


‘Yours truly, Ken.’


Then this is from my brother-in-law, Eric.


'From Eric P.


'I saw my sister, Betty, and my brother-in-law,
Donald, on several occasions during the dates October
13th-15th and I was not aware of anything being
wrong until I was called out of bed at a late hour on
Sunday night to come to sit on the landing and keep
an eye on them. I had previously passed them on the
landing on my way to bed on the upper floor, but
apart from noticing that there was an argument on
about something, I did not notice anything wrong.


'I was up for the rest of the night and saw the events
described in my brother's statement. I remember my

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘I was witness of the events that preceded Dr.
Johnson's removal. My sister went along with him to
the hospital, carrying a large coloured framed
photograph of her small boy, which seemed an odd
sort of thing to do.’


Signed ‘E. W. P.’


These two letters are written by sane witnesses of
events and corroborate my personal, albeit lunatic,
observation.


They also give some clue to Betty's further adventures.


From the moment when we were parted at the entrance
of the mental hospital until she came to visit me several
days later, I did not see her. I was detained behind the
bars: Betty was allowed loose and, as we trace her movements
in the world at large, no question arises of any
personal and possibly fallacious observation on my part.
Evidence as to her behaviour must inevitably rest with
those whose sanity is beyond dispute. Fortunately,
however, Betty was in demonstrative mood and did not
fail to draw attention to herself.


First, she was taken to our friends, the G----s, where
(as brother Ken says) she may have slept, but this sleep
(according to her own account) was interrupted by
delirium in which she was chased by Chinamen. Little
wonder that she became rather too much for the G----s
and was taken to brother Ken's home in the nearby
city.


Here Betty was afraid to be left on her own. She

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The highlight of Betty's adventures was, however, still
to come. This was when, after three days and nights of
coping with her in his small semi-detached house, brother
Ken, who had in self-sacrificing fashion taken a week of
his holiday for this purpose, doubtless started to wonder
what else he could do with her. He finally decided to
take her the two hours' journey up to London with a
view to seeing to our affairs there in general, and to
visit our solicitor, Desmond, in particular.


It must be placed on record as a most remarkable fact
that Betty succeeded in travelling to London and back
without being taken into custody. No evidence exists of
her behaviour on the journey, other than her own
recollection of expounding her rather forthright views on
modern painting and sculpture to a crowded railway
carriage: her further recollection is of her arrival at our
now deserted suburban home to find for some unaccountable
reason an accumulation of full milk bottles on

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A discreet silence still reigns amongst the then
members of my firm concerning her Great Russell
Street appearance. Desmond, on the other hand, has
been kind enough to give me a statement
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_18429');">[note]</a><div id="_note_18429" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗ Printed in full--Appendix II.</div>
, the revelant
part of which can well be given here:


'Mrs. Johnson was brought to London to see me by
her brother on what must have been either the third
or fourth day following Dr. Johnson's admission to
hospital. I was both surprised and alarmed at her
state of mind during our interview. She was wild,
excitable, and incoherent and, speaking as a layman,
I would say that her condition verged on a state of
mania. I remember particularly one incident: I
offered her a cigarette and she refused it, but a few
moments later took one from her own case. Her
brother explained that she thought I was offering her
a doped cigarette. Her mental condition at that time
was far more deranged than could, in my opinion,
be accounted for either by a hysterical upset, or as her
brother suggested, some hypnotic influence of her
husband. I had not previously met Mrs. Johnson
and could not at that time compare her condition
with her normal behaviour. I have since met her in
normal circumstances and I appreciate how unusual
was her behaviour at that time.


‘Yours faithfully,"
E. D.’

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Yes, Betty was very upset.


Such, then, is the evidence concerning Betty's illness
which occurred simultaneously with my own.


This illness was, without doubt, a dual event.


There were other peculiar features about my illness
which I record here, even at the risk of anticipating my
story.


I have spoken of the immense distress that occurred
between myself and my two life-long friends--Harold,
my accountant, and Desmond, my London solicitor.


What on earth was Harold doing? What was Desmond
up to? Managing my affairs, arranging Courts of
Protection for me without even writing me a letter.


Betty, in her excited state, was prey to similar suspicions.
It was a consequence of these that she consulted
our other solicitor, Maurice, during the time I
was still in hopsital. There followed a state of confusion
when the two firms of solicitors girded on their respective
swords and bucklers for the paper war that ensued
between them. Meanwhile, in my own state of suspended
animation, my situation could compare with that of
anyone of the heroes of Edgar Allen Poe--bodily alive,
but legally dead, I lay gagged and imprisoned, a mute
spectator of this warfare over my estate that was taking
place over my legally dead body.


This was one aspect of the problem which faced me
when, after my six weeks in hospital, I made my reentry
into the world of affairs.


However, the answer was simple enough. It required
much understanding on both sides, but eventually
Desmond and I had a reunion lunch at my club:


"But, my dear Donald 1" protested Desmond, as I
explained the position over a second glass of sherry,
"we were TOLD not to write to you. We were TOLD we

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"But surely----" I said.


"May I begin at the beginning?" said Desmond.
"Christopher came up to see us and told us you had been
taken to hospital. That was our first news of your illness.
We phoned the hospital, but we couldn't get much
information. The Medical Superintendent told us that
you would be ill for at least a year--that was, if you ever
got well at all. He didn't seem to think you would.
Naturally I had to protect your interests. What else
could I do? One has to be guided by medical opinion
on such occasions."


Oh dear, dear, dear! All too obvious! An explanation
I had never thought of!


It had been the same surprise to Desmond, as it had
been to many other people, that I was out, apparently
hale and well, within a period of six weeks, while his
Court of Protection proceedings were still in train.
Medical opinion had not only erred, but had erred
wildly in its estimate of the length of time I was likely to
be ill. Desmond, through no fault of his own, had been
put into one of the most embarrassing positions in which
a family solicitor could find himself.


Finally, there was the peculiarity of my unaccustomed
craving for apples--a fruit which, let me repeat, I do
not normally bother about.


This was no delusion. These apples were doing me
good--they were curing me. You will remember how,
every day, Betty had to scour the shops and bring
me in my daily pound of apples to eat. How I told
the family they had to eat apples: Betty had to eat
apples, and our small boy, Norman, had to eat apples

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Indeed, my obsession is on the record in a letter which
I wrote to Ivor from rny hospital ward and which he
thoughtfully kept to return to me at a later date. It is
dated merely ‘Monday evening’ but it is obviously
written some three weeks after my admission and this is
what it says:
<blockquote>
<p>
‘... This must be my priority occupation--to
get to the bottom of the events of a month ago. My
favourite theory is that both Betty and I were poisoned
by some Eastern poison. The antidote to which is
fresh apples. I remember in my first few days in this
hospital how much better I seemed to feel with each
bite of an apple. May I repeat my recommendation
that you should eat fresh apples as what I might call
a prophylactic measure.’
</p>
</blockquote>


‘... This must be my priority occupation--to
get to the bottom of the events of a month ago. My
favourite theory is that both Betty and I were poisoned
by some Eastern poison. The antidote to which is

hospital how much better I seemed to feel with each
bite of an apple. May I repeat my recommendation
that you should eat fresh apples as what I might call
a prophylactic measure.’


The delusions of a lunatic? Maybe so. But the vast
and uninterrupted improvement in my desiccated,
dried-up feeling, as I munched away at apple after
apple during my first days in hospital, was no delusion
at all. Indeed it was so marked, so definite, so unmistakeable,
that there was surely some physical basis
behind this mental state of mine?


I am sorry that my medical attendants did not obtain
my confidence as their patient sufficiently for me to
confide in them as I did to Ivor! I am sorry that they
did not take some notice of rny beneficial physical and
mental reactions to the eating of apples!


Here, however, is my evidence. It is evidence that
marshalled itself gradually--starting from vague gropings
in a mist of uncertainty and confusion, only becoming

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is evidence of some importance--to me, anyway.
It is evidence that, if it had found a hearing, would have
decided whether I had been subject to a temporary
derangement induced by drug poisoning or whether I
was naturally subject to one of the most dreadful and intractable
of mental diseases--that of manic-depressive
psychosis with its virtual certainty of recurrence at some
future date. A job or a career can depend on the decision
based on such evidence: a good reputation can
depend on it: peace of mind and personal happiness
can depend on. it: all in fact that an individual holds
worth while can depend on it.


It is evidence too on which could have depended the
exposure of one of the most nefarious crimes in the
calendar of crime, that of the poisoner with his secret
arts who, by sinister design and nefarious method,
condemns his unsuspecting victim, not perhaps to death
in this instance, but to something almost as bad--
madness and a life overhung by threat of madness.


But where could I go with my evidence?


The remainder of my book will tell you.


My immediate fear, as I have said, was that my
enemies would spring some fresh surprise before I
could present my evidence in the proper quarter. I
had no doubt that, once it reached the proper quarter,
it would receive appropriate attention.


After all, for two people to go right off their heads
simultaneously, in the same manner as Betty and I had,
all in the space of a few days, was just one of those
fantastically absurd things. It was something that
could not possibly happen from natural causes. Anyone
who could believe that this could happen through natural
causes could believe that the moon was made of green
cheese.

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There were, however--as I was soon to find--plenty
of people who were willing, only too willing, to believe
that the moon was made of green cheese. Willing indeed
to state officially that the moon was made of green
cheese, whether they believed it or not.
