Who knew that I'd go to college in the late sixties and be mostly
sober and frightened of most drugs? I mean, if there ever was a time
to get fucked up those were the years when it sort of made sense, at
least historically speaking. I was pretty fucking straight, long hair
and all. As alienated as I felt growing up I must have been happy
enough by the time I got to college that I didn't lave the need <i>at all</i>
to wipe out my feelings or expand my mind as much as to discover
who the fuck I was. I guess it was after I graduated—poor, scared,
and feeling that I would amount to nothing—when every sidewalk
became a red carpet to the nearest liquor store. Yet at school I had a
ball and actually was mostly coherent for all of it. I mean, sure, I got
high every now and then, but it never became a burning thing to do,
or a must. New women and new rock albums and new books were
plenty.


Without a doubt, my four years attending Ohio State were the
most pleasurable times of my life. In fact, I'm sure of it. For one, I
was away from home and far away from the scene of the emotional
crime of making me feel invisible. I made friends who listened to me
and admired my sense of humor. I'll always remember being out
with a lot of pals, professors and artists at some Chinese restaurant,
and I was in the middle of a riff when the waiter interrupted me and
asked for orders. With all the people there it took about ten minutes.
As soon as the waiter left, the guy sitting next to me turned and said
very casually, "Now, where were you, Richard?" I was staggered.
Not only did someone remember that I was talking, but he actually
wanted to hear what I had to say. It was a stunning revelation. I
haven't stopped talking since.


And what does any of this have to do with my future alcoholism?
Well, I'm not exactly sure, and yet, ironically, given the newly discovered
openness to drug experimentation and all that hippie shit

I was just busy happily enjoying my freedom away from almost
everyone I had ever known; meeting people who actually seemed to
care about what I had to say; struggling with free love, and with my
dismay at American involvement in Vietnam. That set the backdrop
for my encounter with <i>the man</i>.


With the war on the tube every night provoking an insane
amount of anxiety, I found myself (after a heated political discussion
in some pseudointellectual bar) on the Ohio State campus wondering
and wandering aimlessly, eventually to a friend's pad, while for
the first time experimenting with opium. I was excited because the
space cadet at the hippie saloon who I'd scored from told me it was
pretty safe and that I would have beautiful dreams while walking
home. I figured, since I was too afraid of LSD (thinking I'd kill myself
unintentionally), pot was a bust, and beer didn't really interest me,
that it seemed reasonable enough to give it a whirl. Being fed up
with my recurring nightmares about not being able to find the classroom
for my final exams, the prospect of having pleasant hallucinations
while still awake seemed pretty damn cool.


The opium had no effect on me except it cost me money and gave
me a craving to find a pickup basketball game and finger paint again.
Well, okay, I guess that it had some effect but hey, I had wilder, more
enlightening daydreams straight, and besides, I was living on a tight
budget with money that my father sent me from back home in New

"Hey, Dad."


"Richard?"


"Yeah."


"Wanna speak to your mom?"


"Sure...but..."


"Is everything all right?"


"Yeah, Mom...but I wanted to ask Dad something."


"What? You have secrets from me?"


"I'm sorry, you're right. Listen, can you ask Dad to send me an
extra fifty bucks a month for opium?"


<i>Like that conversation wouldn't have caused a double suicide</i>.


The opium high a dud and feeling stone-cold sober, I still headed
excitedly to my buddy's flat to cop a listen from this new rocker, Jimi
Hendrix. My friend had heard the album that morning and had
called me a million times saying over and over again, "My God, you
won't believe this shit."


Now, when I got to his place, he let me in, said nothing, and
handed me the <i>Are You Experienced?</i> album. He acted like he was the
keeper of some dark secret. Displaying a rare twinkle in his eyes, he
turned and retreated to his room. I gazed at the photo of this weird
threesome on the album cover and then placed the LP on the
turntable, anxious to hear what the big to-do was all about. I still get
excited thinking that the time it took to place the needle down on
the first track was all the time I had left to struggle through life without
knowing that "Purple Haze" existed and would keep me company
forevermore.


I was alone with the headphones on, lying on the dirty floor of
his psychotically decorated living room, staring up at a Marx Brothers
poster while my friend was either fucking someone in his bedroom
or yelling at himself. He was a strange guy but it hardly
registered with me for the next forty minutes or so.


Everything changed for me then. I mean really, really changed. I
was only about eighteen or nineteen and I must have been inspired

It saddens me to think that I must have felt so hollow inside that
I needed to attach myself to something, some force that I could create
from within to express to others, a "thing" that would embody
what I felt best represented who I thought I was; and to do it to such
a degree and with such a vengeance that there was no room to think
about or attach myself to much else. Almost a quarter of a century
later, after hearing a lot of laughs and drinking a lot of alcohol, I let
God into my life. A God that would save my life. But before I needed
a higher power, I needed hope on the ground. Hendrix played with
such reckless, authentic, powerful purity, it shook me up in a way
that—although I didn't understand at the time—ultimately gave me
a faith in myself as an artist that I never thought I would have.


After I finished hearing the record I let myself out. In an almost
trancelike fashion, I started walking back through the streets, trying
to find my apartment, while in such a state of euphoria that I
could've trudged on forever and it wouldn't have mattered. I had
been shaken to my core. And hadn't even known that I had a core.


The music I heard that day sounded like nothing I had ever heard
before or since. It was inconceivable that this guy and his two band
members were making this strange sound and so much of it. It was
indescribable. It was out of this world. In fact, I felt like I did when I
fantasized walking in some field and actually seeing a flying saucer
land, just standing there stunned as the aliens came down their
gangplank to check me out. I'd be in a state of shock but mostly feeling
amazed and blessed that I had the good fortune to be one of the

Jimi Hendrix sounded like he came from outer space. I had never
in my life heard anyone play as if he was put on the planet to do
only this. Forget about different. This was it. Game over. Rock fans
had their Messiah.


Finally, I had a private, ear-shattering sanctuary, a place I could
go to and listen, for the rest of my life, for an energy and a touchstone
that was so unusually forceful and full of love that I knew I
could get happy no matter what.
