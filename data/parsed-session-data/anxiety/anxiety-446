BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, how are you doing?
<b>PT:</b> Oh better than I was.
<b>DR:</b> So the Provigil was causing the anxiety attacks.
<b>PT:</b> Apparently.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. You’re the second person I’ve known that’s happened to. It’s not supposed to increase anxiety but occasionally it does.
<b>PT:</b> I was really anxious.
<b>DR:</b> How long did it take for it to go away after you stopped it?
<b>PT:</b> Well I stopped taking it yesterday and I felt better yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> So the first, within hours, I guess the first day you didn’t take it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. And today the anxiety is lower again?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well I guess that’s not going to be the answer then. How’s your mood been in terms of the depression?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I’m very depressed.
<b>DR:</b> Did the Provigil help at all with the depression or not really?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t think so, you know, because it took so damn long to get that damn prescription with the insurance company.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that was amazing.
<b>PT:</b> But I was taking a half, 15 mg of the other one pretty much right up until I started the Provigil. I happened to have some of that there so -
<b>DR:</b> I know.
<b>PT:</b> So, I don’t know, you know, what caused it whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. So we’ve got to find something else that’s going to help with the depression then. Okay, how are you sleeping?
<b>PT:</b> Not too bad. 
<b>DR:</b> You have no trouble getting to sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Not really.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Not too often.
<b>DR:</b> And you stay asleep through the night?
<b>PT:</b> Most of the time, I mean I may wake up a little bit but I mean I go right back to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. And how’s your energy during the day?
<b>PT:</b> Low.
<b>DR:</b> Low, okay. How about appetite?
<b>PT:</b> That’s really gotten weird too. My stomach has really been kind of weird too.
<b>DR:</b> Are you having diarrhea?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, some but it’s just, I don’t know, it doesn’t feel right and I don’t know what’s up with that but, I don’t know.
<b>DR:</b> So have you been eating less then because your stomach’s -
<b>PT:</b> I think, yeah, which I do need to cut back, because I’ve been laying around hibernating, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, with this weather it’s easy to stay inside and not do much.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Have you been doing any exercise at all?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have been exercising.
<b>DR:</b> Are you walking, what are you doing?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I try to actually was able to like [INAUDIBLE], you know, just the road a couple of times last week so, when weather permits, I’m out there, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But yeah, some.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, how’s your concentration and focus these days?
<b>PT:</b> Not bad.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Are you getting enjoyment out of things or you just kind of go through the motions?
<b>PT:</b> I go through the motions.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I just really don’t, I mean I almost isolate myself, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and suicidal thoughts recently. No, okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Depressed.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Very.
<b>DR:</b> What about stresses? Is work going okay?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. Any other major stresses right now that are weighing on you?
<b>PT:</b> No. My one sister that’s been having a lot of problems, she finally got their electricity back on and then she’s going to get another job.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good.
<b>PT:</b> She got laid off for a month so that was very draining and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Where’s she working?
<b>PT:</b> She works, she’s back at an [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED]. She’s doing [DEIDENTIFIED] and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, is she a [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, good. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, she’s got, so it was a huge relief.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That was very taxing. I was very worried about her, you know.
<b>DR:</b> That was a bad situation. They didn’t have power. They were without power for what days, weeks?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think it was like seven, eight days but I think they’re still, the town’s back out, they don’t have power, you know.
<b>DR:</b> That’s amazing.
<b>PT:</b> She sent me a picture and, of course, it’s [INAUDIBLE] as hell, but there was no telephone poles.
<b>DR:</b> They just broke off or -
<b>PT:</b> Snapped from the ice storm. It was weird.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It was really weird.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.
<b>PT:</b> So she’s doing better, thank God.
<b>DR:</b> Good, good, good. Anything else you’re worried about these days or feel stressed by? Not really?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. So it’s just the depression that keeps going. Okay. Well we’ve got a couple, some other strategies. The Effexor?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I’m still taking that.
<b>DR:</b> Still taking 150, it’s not doing anything, basically. We’ve tried higher doses so we can’t really go any higher. Are you using the Xanax much for anxiety?
<b>PT:</b> I have lately, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Like how often about?
<b>PT:</b> For a few days there it was every day but kind of backed off, you know, the last couple of days.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe every two or three days?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean at night I really took, you know, the last four or five days. I was taking half a pill every other night I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> And I haven’t really drank as much as normal.
<b>DR:</b> Cut back?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> How much now?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, well like last night I just had two beers after work so I’m trying to, you know, I just don’t like drinking a bunch when I’m this depressed.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that’s a good idea, actually, unfortunately, will make it worse.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. And pot?
<b>PT:</b> Still smoking a little pot.
<b>DR:</b> A little every day?
<b>PT:</b> Not every day, every other or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Alright. Still taking the Ambien for sleep or not needing it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah it seems like I try taking a half of one maybe over the weekend or something but -
<b>DR:</b> Not very often?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And how about the Trazodone?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I take them every night, two of them.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and your sleep, you said, is okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> On the weekends you take the Ambien is it because you’re just a little bit more wired and think you might have more trouble getting to sleep?
<b>PT:</b> I guess, I don’t know, it’s just that I just want to go to sleep, you know, I’m sick of my mind going and stuff, I just want to go to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, but you use it maybe once or twice a week on the weekends?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. So, [PATIENT NAME], we’ve got to find something. The Effexor isn’t cutting it so we’ve got to find some other antidepressant. I’ve got a list of things to try. I’m thinking the SSRIs first which are the Lexapro family. There’s Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, Lexapro, Luvox. 
<b>PT:</b> I’ve tried a few of them.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you’ve been on a few of them. You’ve been on, let’s see, the Prozac, Lexapro, have you been on Zoloft ever?
<b>PT:</b> I think that was the first one I ever tried and for some reason, I don’t know -
<b>DR:</b> It didn’t seem to work.
<b>PT:</b> That was a long time ago.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay. Okay, so that family, you tried a few of them. I think you tried Wellbutrin, didn’t you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that got me really anxious.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. That’s not a good option. We tried Effexor and Cymbalta which are the two that are called a [INAUDIBLE] norepinephrine. The third one in that family that we haven’t tried is Remeron. I don’t think you’ve been on Remeron.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that was the last prescription you gave me. I mean, before -
<b>DR:</b> Oh there it is in your chart.
<b>PT:</b> I didn’t do well on that.
<b>DR:</b> So we’ve tried all three in that family. One thing we haven’t really tried are the old tricyclic antidepressants. Have you ever been on -
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know anything about those.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they’re medicines that were around decades ago. They’re still around, they just haven’t been used as much because the newer medicines came in and everybody thought they were so much better.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> They have some advantage but for some people the old ones work better, in fact, I just put an article on my bulletin board yesterday; they did a study looking at post partum depression in women -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And they compared Zoloft with an old tricyclic antidepressant called Nortriptyline and found out that Nortriptyline actually worked a little better than the newer Zoloft for women and with a little different side effect profile but most people tolerate it pretty well. With Nortriptyline, the advantages of it are you can usually use pretty low doses, a lot of people that don’t respond to the newer medicines respond well to the older ones. We can also do blood levels if we need to. With some of the medicines, people taking a normal dose just don’t feel better but we don’t know if it’s really getting in their system or not. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> They may not be absorbing it especially if they’re having stomach trouble or the body may be metabolizing it or chewing it up. With Nortriptyline, we can actually do a blood test and find out how much is actually in your bloodstream.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> I had one gentleman a couple of years ago that we were giving him a good dose and eventually wasn’t feeling any better because blood test found out that his blood level was nondetectable so we had to bump him up to what normally would be just about a lethal dose or other people. His blood levels came up to the normal range and he felt better.
<b>PT:</b> Hmm.
<b>DR:</b> So we have more of an ability to know just how much you’re getting in your system.
<b>PT:</b> Through the blood.
<b>DR:</b> Through the blood test and we don’t have to do a blood test but we can, whereas with some of these newer ones, blood tests aren’t helpful, we can’t even do them. That’s another advantage. Possible side effects with these older ones can be things like a little dry mouth, sometimes a little constipation, and usually that’s about it really. Occasionally a mild headache for a few days but that’s unusual. Also, they don’t cause weight gain. They don’t interfere with sexual function like some of the newer ones so when they work, they really work pretty well. Again, we just don’t use them as much anymore because people have gone to the newer medicines thinking they’re better. The other thing that used to happen is the older ones like Nortriptyline were very dangerous if people overdosed on them. I mean very dangerous. If people took like a week’s worth of medicine, they often would die even if they changed their mind and called for help, at the Emergency Room they couldn’t save them because in overdose, they make the heart stop.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> So if you become suicidal, we can’t really safely use these but you’re not suicidal so -
<b>PT:</b> What about drinking with them?
<b>DR:</b> Well with all the antidepressants, it’s not a good idea just because it can worsen depression.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> In theory it may be less like to affect those in terms of worsening depression than the SSRIs because, again, we think that alcohol makes people more depressed because it lowers their serotonin and these actually don’t work so much on serotonin as the newer medicines, they work more on a chemical called norepinephrine.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Which is sort of like adrenaline.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And for some people that seems to work better so, again, the minimal amount of alcohol the better.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But if you have a beer or two it’s probably not going to make a huge difference. So I think those might be one option. There’s another option we could consider. There’s a new one out that’s a whole other class. It’s a little more complicated. It’s called EMSAM<b> </b> have you heard of that? 
<b>PT:</b> Hmm-um.
<b>DR:</b> It’s different for a couple of reasons. It’s a different chemical class. It’s what’s called the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, MAOI. Again, we used to have MAOIs years and years ago but we rarely use them today because they have a couple of potential really bad side effects. You’ve got to be real careful about what foods you eat and what medicines you took or there could be an interaction where your blood pressure goes through the ceiling. I know, and in twenty years of being a psychiatrist, I’ve had three patients on them, two have made it up to the Emergency Room because of interactions, one was because another doctor put one of my patients on a medicine and didn’t check for interactions and the patient didn’t tell me, and the other one was a gentleman that was on vacation in [DEIDENTIFIED] and probably ate something he shouldn’t have and he ended up in the ER with high blood pressure and they treated him. He got out but my point is they are really tricky to work with. The new version of them in the patch form -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Is better in that there aren’t the food restrictions at lower doses so you can eat whatever you want. We do still have to be careful with the medicines though. Like for instance, you couldn’t take it with Effexor or Trazodone, so it’s not at the top of my list because they’re kind of complicated to use.
<b>PT:</b> And that’s the new one you’re talking about?
<b>DR:</b> That’s a new one. Yeah, they came out with a new version of the MAOI, a new medicine that’s in a patch form which is different. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you put a patch on once a day and then take it off instead of taking a pill. I don’t know that the patch is a big advantage other than it gets around some of those dietary restrictions so, you know, in my mind it’s lower down on the list because of the difficulties with potential risks. The Nortriptyline is much safer.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. And probably easier to get.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Freaking insurance.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly, it’s generic, it’s cheap, whereas EMSAM you might have to jump through all kinds of hoops again to get it authorized. 
<b>PT:</b> I'm frigging sick of it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so do you want to try something like Nortriptyline, a different class to see if it will work better?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess.
<b>DR:</b> I think it’s worth a shot.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The worst thing is, if you don’t like it we’ll stop it but it doesn’t tend to worsen anxiety like Provigil at all. Again, the most common side effects you going to have could be a little dry mouth, maybe some constipation although that unusual, and usually that’s about it. Some people did feel a little tired. If that’s the case, you can take it at nighttime. It’s not terribly sedating, not as much as like Trazodone, so you can usually take it any time of day and what we do is we start slowly trying to build up gradually to reduce the risk of side effects. One other possible side effect, not so much for this one but it can happen, is if you stand up real fast sometimes you get a little lightheaded like all the blood rushes to your feet.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If you find that happening, just get up a little slower. Don’t jump out of bed or out of the chair but that’s not real common with Nortriptyline. Okay, does that sound like something you want to try?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, let’s give it a shot.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, let’s try something.
<b>DR:</b> You may have also heard there’s a brand name for this one, it’s called Pamelor, have you ever heard that name?
<b>PT:</b> It sounds familiar.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, again it’s been around for years but most people take the generic form of it now.
<b>PT:</b> No I’m sure it what I’ll have to get. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But this may take a while to get into my system, is that one of those?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, unfortunately, it’s one of those that takes a little while. Although, again in the study they just did with the post partum depression, they said it actually worked quicker than they expected even so we’ll keep our fingers crossed and if we have to ramp it up I can go slower or I can go a little faster. Do you want me to go a little faster just to try to get it in your system a little quicker?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and if it’s too fast we’ll back off and go slower then.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And is it easy for you to take medicine in the evening or at night time.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, it don’t really matter, I mean, you know -
<b>DR:</b> You can take it - I’ll just put each day, you can decide. I’d probably start it, just in case if you do get a little dry mouth or get a little tired then you sleep it off.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, I’ll take it at night then.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, just to start with, okay. We’ll increase it every two days, try to ramp it up a little faster, so we’ll have you take 25 mg at bedtime for two days, then 50.
<b>PT:</b> Do you have samples or do I have to go to the -
<b>DR:</b> Unfortunately, since it’s generic they don’t give samples anymore.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But it should be fairly cheap.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that Provigil was, my co-pay was $40.
<b>DR:</b> I gave somebody a prescription for it and it was going to be like $700. I couldn’t believe it. That’s without insurance. Was it $400 or $700, it was something ridiculous.
<b>PT:</b> Oh God that’s insane.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they couldn’t get it. Their insurance wouldn’t cover it. And [PATIENT NAME] once we find out the right dose for you, I’ll give you a bigger size pill so you don’t have to take so many pills because we’re going to start you on one a day for two days then two pills a day for three, but they make a 75 mg strength too, so if that’s the right dose we can change over. The maximum recommended dose of this is 150 but I’ve rarely had people get to that high of a dose and if we do need to go to higher doses, sometimes we have to check an EKG because, again, the reason for this is if you take too much of it, it can slow down the electricity through the heart which is not a good thing. In normal doses, that doesn’t happen. Okay. But I’m just cautious with it to be on the safe side.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah. I do take a blood pressure medicine.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. This one should not increase your blood pressure.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> If anything, sometimes it will decrease a little but I wouldn’t count on that and if this works well then we can start backing off the Effexor too.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Any questions about this one at all?
<b>PT:</b> What was the name of it, Pamelor?
<b>DR:</b> Pamelor is the brand name, the generic is Nortriptyline.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay. 
<b>DR:</b> That’s what it will say on the bottle. If you have any questions once you start just call me.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I’ll be around this weekend and next week. I’ll get you the prescription first and you’re doing okay with your other prescriptions as far as you know? 
<b>PT:</b> As far as I know.
<b>DR:</b> It’s been a while. They can just call me if you need anything.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I tried to do the mail in but, I mean, I can’t with this yet but hopefully -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, once -
<b>PT:</b> Well, if it works.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. If it works and we know what dose, then we’ll get you a mail order prescription.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Let’s check back in a couple of weeks, okay, just to make sure it’s working. Let’s see, that will put us somewhere around the 15<sup>th</sup>. Mornings were best for you, mid-morning?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How would Tuesday the 20<sup>th</sup> work, like around nine-thirty?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, as far as I know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Okay, there’s the card. Any questions [PATIENT NAME] about anything we talked about?
<b>PT:</b> No, I don’t think so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, if you have any problems or any questions, once you try it just give me a call, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, sorry I had to leave you a freaking message the other night. I was just like not doing good. 
<b>DR:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE] any time. If things aren’t working, we need to make changes. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. I didn’t work, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I was hoping too. But we haven’t run out of options, we’ll keep trying, okay.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> Hang in there.
<b>PT:</b> You too.
<b>DR:</b> I’ll see you later, bye-bye.
