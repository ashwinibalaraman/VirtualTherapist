<b>Chapter 2</b>

For the event of our engagement I had planned several
activities hoping to please Mary. We were to go to the
Thanksgiving day football game scheduled to be held in the
city where we had spent the night. However, we had first
planned to go to the university for a visit.

We arose late and dressed for an early dinner. This was
the day before Thanksgiving. For dinner, we entered the
main dining room of the best hotel in town. I wanted to
show Mary a good time. The dinner was excellent, and was
over in due course of time.


As we sat there, satisfied with food, I said, "I would like
to talk to you, Mary."


"Oh, be quiet," she replied in her perversity, and in the
same breath asked, "Where are they?"


I knew that Mary meant the rings. However, this aggressive
response to my approach on the subject of marriage left
me bewildered and amazed. I was put out to such an extent
that I said no more. I decided then that this was not the
time and place.


We had begun to drive about town when the thought
came to me to drive to a spot I knew at the top of a nearby
mountain. I felt that this second selection would be an ideal
spot to talk to Mary.


Without hesitation or telling Mary all that was in my
thoughts, I drove in the direction of the mountain. On the
way I decided to stop at a drugstore for a pack of cigarettes.
As I was getting out of the car, Mary spoke.


"I want to see them," she said.


I was taken aback and nonplused. I took the ring case
out of my pocket, opened it and displayed the rings to Mary.
Apparently she did not want any pretty words or a planned
situation. She only wanted to become engaged.


With what I did not recognize as the aggressive act of a
disturbed person, Mary took the engagement ring out of
the case herself. Before I could gasp in surprise, she had put
the ring on the third finger of her left hand. I was completely
astonished at her act but, nevertheless, I was engaged.


Pondering over the doings mentioned here, I drove rapidly
and without much conversation to the university. All
the way there, I tried to fathom the situation, sensing deeply
that something was amiss, but came up with nothing that
made sense.

The following day we drove back to the city and attended
the football game. I attended as an old grad in proper
demeanor, and Mary, somewhat bewildered, but engaged.


There was a dance after the game, which Mary and I
attended. We left early because we had to drive back to the
university where Mary spent the night with mutual friends
and I at my fraternity. The following morning I took Mary
to her classes, and I started North to my job.


From the very first time I had met Mary I had never had
the slightest misgiving as to how I felt about her, and believed
that she felt the same way about me. However, as I
was returning to my work, I pondered over the events leading
up to our engagement, and an uneasy feeling came over
me. I must have brushed it aside, for somehow Mary's antics
seemed a little cute to me then.
