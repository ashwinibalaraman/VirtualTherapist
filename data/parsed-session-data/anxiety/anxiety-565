<i>T</i>he train pulls into Gloucester--it's nearly
7:00 P.M. As the sharp, February wind fills the open station
door, it chills me since I'm still dressed in the summer
clothes I've worn in Alabama. My friend Ginger meets me
at the station and has a taxi waiting to take us home. Glad
to see each other, we talk excitedly, trying to catch up with
the past year's happenings in five minutes. Before I realize
it, I'm standing at Ma's front door. I know she's home
because I saw her sitting at the kitchen window as we
drove past in the taxi. Calling out to her, I knock several
times but she won't answer. I'm hurt, feeling like a stray
dog who doesn't deserve to be lost. I've come a long way,
it's cold, and I'm tired. Sure, Ma doesn't want to have
anything more to do with me, but she shouldn't turn me
away with no place to go. I'm getting angrier and angrier.
After several more attempts to get her to open the door, I
finally give up and leave.


Ginger has already gone home. The only place I can
think of going is to cousin Lena's. As I walk to her house,
my insides are trembling from the cold. The ten minute
walk seems like an hour. Lena and her family are really

[p. <i>78</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The following morning there's a knock at the door. It's
Ma. I leave the room so that Anna can talk to her privately.
I think Ma has already made up her mind that she'll take
me home because it doesn't take Anna long to convince
her. I overhear Anna telling Ma that I belong at home and
that both of us need each other. After a few minutes I join
them, telling Ma that I'll try not to be a burden to her and
try to help her. Ma seems satisfied and I can feel the tension
in the room evaporate.


I spend two stormy years at home with Ma. I try holding
a job in a frozen fish factory, but because of my continuing
attacks of anxiety, I have to quit after three weeks. To
make matters worse, Ma's health, now that she's in her late
seventies, is failing rapidly. She's too old and too sick to
cope with a twenty-six-year-old daughter who's grown so
dependent on her.


Because of her age, Ma has also become very forgetful
and although I do nothing to engender her mistrust, she
always feels I'm taking advantage of her. She'll hide
money, forget where she's hidden it, and then accuse me of
taking it. And when she's found it again, she doesn't apologize.
One day she loses a five dollar gold piece which
she's always worn around her neck on a gold chain. She
hunts and hunts for it but can't find it. She becomes so

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What makes living with Ma especially difficult is that
she's so far removed from my generation. She doesn't
allow me to date or bring home friends, male or female.
The only friend she approves of is Ginger and that's
because Ginger doesn't date but stays at home and takes
care of her elderly father. I want to have friends but because
of Ma's attitude, most of the young women I know tend to
stay away. Also, many of my friends are already married--
our interests have grown apart.


Although living with Ma is filled with problems, it's
difficult to move out. I feel totally unequipped to live independently.
I can't hold down a job because of severe
anxiety attacks and increasing depression. Also I've no
particular skills with which to start a career. I've been
sheltered all my life. Pa believed that women should not
have to support themselves, so at an early age I learned to
depend on others for my support. Another obstacle to
going out on my own is my fear that I can't handle myself
emotionally. Because of the time I've spent at the Castle,
others treat me as someone who'll never be able to stand on
her own feet--I guess I believe them.


During my last year with Ma, she starts to complain that
she isn't feeling well. She visits the doctor frequently, but
he can't diagnose what's ailing her. On Thanksgiving Day,
we eat a turkey dinner brought to us by one of our relatives.

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She's in the hospital for fourteen days and during that
time I feel completely torn apart and abandoned. I visit her
every day and each time she looks worse. Often a nurse
calls on the phone, "Your ma's asking for you. I think you
should come back to see her." Finally Ma goes into a coma.
The doctor says she has diabetes and that there's no chance
of survival. Seeing her is torment. Her face has the look of
death, and when I return home in the evening, I expect any
minute to hear she's gone. The phone rings often, but it's
always a neighbor or relative inquiring about Ma. Each
time after I hang up the phone, I dash for the toilet and
vomit. I'm so frightened that at one point I cry out to God
for help. I can't express what I want to say. Words just
burst out, unconnected, "God, help ... I'm scared ...
help me ..." But there is no help. Death finally comes to
Ma and I'm alone. My last bit of hope dies with her and I
cry all night.


Ma is waked at the funeral home and then buried
alongside of Pa. During the wake my head hurts--it's like
a fever. I try to ignore it but by the time of the funeral I
feel so bad I can't go. My relatives understand and don't
pressure me. While the funeral is taking place, I'm at
cousin Anna's. Conflicting thoughts about what's in store
for me make me confused. Now I can't think of my
future--there is none.


Shortly after noon, Anna returns with a few of the
relatives. I'm very tense as we all sit at the kitchen table

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As soon as I reach the street, I run as fast as I can. My
very life depends on reaching Ma's house. The tension in
my head is at the boiling point, and as I pass the cars on the
road, they fade before my eyes. The sidewalk is thin air
under my racing feet and appears to be tipped sideways,
making me unsteady. There's the house! I can't believe I've
made it. Out of breath, my heart pounding wildly, I run up
the stairs, swing open the door, and race to my room.
There's the bed! I throw myself on it.


Lying there, I close my eyes. The intense pressure in my
head frightens me--I'm afraid my blood vessels are going
to burst. I try to calm myself, telling myself over and over,
"Everything's going to be all right. Just don't give in to
this ... I can't give in to this." I slowly open my eyes and
as I gaze about the room, I feel death all about me. The
room tilts at an angle and while I stare straight ahead, it
becomes distorted, as if a shiny window has been placed
directly in front of my eyes. Everything is confusing--I
lose my bearings and no longer know what I'm doing.
Around me everything is slipping away and I reach for
something, anything, but there's nothing to hang on to.
Am I going crazy? Or am I dying? I don't know whether

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All the while, as I try to control myself, I'm struggling
to stay alive. The panic in my stomach mounts and recedes
like a moving tide--it's got to stop! I think of Ma's sleeping
pills. In desperation, I dash into the bathroom. My
head's reeling back and forth. The floor's rolling under my
feet. Here's a bottle of sleeping capsules on the top shelf of
the medicine cabinet--I'm relieved. I take one capsule with
a glass of water and go back to bed. Soon I'm asleep but
still restless and tense.


When I open my eyes I look about the room to see what
it's like. Everything is in place and the room is no longer
tilted. I'm a little hung over from the sleeping pill and my
head is fuzzy. But the sleep has helped. I'm no longer so
panic stricken, though my stomach is still queasy. It's dark
now, though the moonlight makes the room with all its
furnishings clearly visible. Turning on the lamp, I look
at the clock. I'm surprised--it's eight o'clock. I've slept
four hours.


My head still aches and my body feels hot. The terrible
experience of a few hours earlier must have been emotional
because I'm still alive, but maybe I'm physically sick as
well. I take my temperature - 104Â°. That's OK. But I still
feel the grip of that terrible upheaval, even though I'm
calmer. I must be mentally sick--and that terrifying
upheaval will soon repeat itself.


What should I do next? I don't want to disturb my
relatives--they won't understand, or even care. But I can't
stay in the house--death is still there. I'd better leave the
house and go to the hotel which is only a few minutes'
walk away. I pack a few clothes and leave.

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Once in the hotel room, I lie down on the bed and wrap
myself in blankets. Racked by chills, I can't get warm. As
my whole body shivers, the panic in my stomach twists
my insides and makes me sick. I start to vomit. Trying not
to soil the rugs I grab a wastebasket. I continue to vomit
until after midnight. Between bouts of sickness I cry in
desperation, crying out for someone to hold me. Immobilized
by fear, I see no way out. The only thing to do is to
call my family doctor. At 1:00 A.M. I'm reluctant to wake
her up but I need help. I phone. A sleepy voice answers
and I tell Dr. Evert about Ma's death and how sick I feel
emotionally as well as physically. She admits me to
Gloucester General Hospital and within a half-hour I'm
there. A nurse helps me to bed and gives me a shot. I begin
relaxing and soon I'm sleeping. I'm glad to be where I can
get some help.


When I wake up the next morning I'm relieved to find
the symptoms of yesterday have subsided. The hospital
gives me a sense of security which I'd totally lost when Ma
died. With Ma gone, there's no one left to care for me, no
one who's concerned about what will happen to me.


I've never felt completely accepted by the Bartello relatives
--I'm "in the way" as far as they're concerned.
Although my sister-in-law Sarah and brother Marco are
living in the area again and are willing to have me stay with
them, this can be only a short-term solution. The thought
of being responsible for myself overwhelms me. I'm so
insecure and ill-equipped to handle my future, and I know
the emotional distress of yesterday will recur ... and then
I can't control those feelings. I feel hopeless.


I'm very surprised when, two days later, the doctor tells
me I have mononucleosis and infectious hepatitis. My first

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Sarah comes to see me I repeat to her what the
doctor has said but mention nothing about my distressing
emotional experiences. She agrees to take me home with
her, at least temporarily, until I can decide what I want
to do. Although I don't want to be any trouble to Sarah
and Marco, I go home with them--it's the only thing I
can do at that time. I want very much to put the pieces of
my life together, but I don't believe that I'm equal to the
task.


Leaving Gloucester General, I feel very shaky. My first
day at Sarah's is a quiet one. She makes some chicken soup
for supper, and, after spending the afternoon in bed, I'm
able to eat. I'm making sense when I talk and I look pretty
good physically. But all the while I'm struggling inside.
The panic still seems imminent, ready to overwhelm me
again. Yet I manage to get through the day.


Making it through the day is one thing but the night
brings another round of torment. Lying in bed in the quiet
house, I hear the heavy breathing of the children as they
sleep. Then, the panic slowly mounts and I hide my head
under the covers so that I don't scream out. I'm lost! Crying,
slowly at first, and then uncontrollably, I try to pray
but the words stick in my mind and I can't go on. Suddenly,
I feel that I have to get out. I'm desperate to flee, but
where should I go? The Loring General in Boston. They
have an emergency care ward. This time I'm really sick and
surely they'll help me. I quietly dress, grab my winter

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At 12:00 in the morning the last train to Boston pulls
into the Gloucester station. I board and go directly to a
seat. When the train begins to move, I seize the arms of
my seat with a tight grip. I feel drawn upward--my body
sucked into the door and out the moving train. I sit rigidly
in total terror. The conductor approaches and asks for
my fare. I try to hide my distress by smiling. When I finally
accomplish the purchase of my ticket, and the conductor
moves on to the next seat, I take several easy breaths, but
the relief is temporary. As the train makes its various stops,
I sit as if glued to my seat. My hands, now sweaty, are
stiff from the force of my grip. I'm too terrified to move
even a slight bit. The only way I can stop myself from
jumping off the train is to hold on to my seat for dear life.
It's only an hour's ride to Boston, but the train seems to
go on and on, stopping slowly, so slowly, at each town
on the way. When, finally, the conductor calls out,
"Boston!" I relax slightly and quickly step down the platform.
Walking out to the street, I hail a taxi to take me
to the hospital.


I'm standing in front of the emergency entrance of Loring
General. It's nearly 2:00 A.M. and a strong west wind is
blowing. The cold air sharpens my senses--it feels good to
be able to think a little more clearly. After a few moments,
I enter. A nurse directs me to a small examining room and
tells me to wait. I'm starting to settle down. I wait nervously
for the doctor to arrive and when he does, I begin
sobbing unashamedly, letting go of my bound-up anxiety.


Dr. Green is a tall, middle-aged man. I feel uneasy as he
looks down at me with his penetrating eyes. He asks
what's troubling me as I try to wipe away my tears.

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I don't know... I don't know what's really wrong with
me," I struggle to explain what I've been experiencing since
Ma's death but I'm awkward under his steady gaze, and I
can't find the words to describe the panic attacks.


Dr. Green is impatient--he wants some answers.


"I've got mononucleosis and hepatitis. They told me
that at Loring." It seems easier to start with my physical
problems. "But I have other problems that I'm really afraid
of ... feelings that scare me like I've never been scared
before ... they come suddenly ... I'm so frightened I
want to run away, for my life ..." I'm not making much
sense but that's the best I can do. It's too difficult to express
what I really feel.


Dr. Green looks at me, but I know he's not interested.
Perhaps if I had described my mental condition more
clearly, he could understand my desperation. But these
panic attacks are new experiences for me--I have a hard
time describing them even to myself and Dr. Green doesn't
encourage me to find the necessary words.


Although I've been in the mental hospital before, this is
the first time I've felt more than just depressed. I'd seen
plenty of other patients at Sutton State who were seriously
ill but I didn't realize then that they might be suffering
from the same kind of feelings that I've just had. I didn't
realize then the pain they must be suffering. I try to convince
Dr. Green that I'm desperate, fragile, and anxious,
that I'm having the hallucinations of a mental patient ...
that I'm mentally ill. But he disregards everything I tell
him, and considering only my physical condition, admits
me to the emergency medical ward. I remain there for
three days while tests are completed to verify the diagnosis
of mononucleosis and hepatitis. Then Dr. Green wants to
discharge me. But when he realizes that I definitely won't

I'm very unsure about going to Crestwood but agree
because it seems to be the only place available. At least I'll
be secure there and that's important. I figure that if I'm
secure I can be relatively free from my emotional problems
--that's what happened in my recent stays at Gloucester
General Hospital and Loring General.


Crestwood is located on the outskirts of Boston, across
from a beautiful park. The building itself is an attractive
home which has recently been renovated. The place
doesn't have the usual nursing home smell--I'm glad. A
nurse greets me, taking me into a three-bed room that's
occupied by two older women who are both confined to
wheelchairs. She introduces me to my two new roommates
and then, after a few words of reassurance, leaves.


Though its rooms are light and its furnishings new,
Crestwood still has an atmosphere of hopelessness. The
other patients are very old--my two roommates have little
hope of leaving Crestwood alive. There's little to amuse
me in Crestwood. There's no radio or T.V. in my room,
and I'm not allowed in other parts of the house. I begin to
feel restless and depressed. Some of my old anxiety returns
and I try to cope with it by taking long walks in the park.


Before the first week is over, I'm thinking of leaving
Crestwood and confide my intention of running away to
my roommates. I still have the uneasy feeling that my
emotional problem is not completely gone. Although I've
