<font size="4"><b>Club Isolation</b></font>

I felt a strange energy churning somewhere very deep in my soul as
I listened to John Lennon's first solo album. I was only about
twenty-two when I heard and felt his amazingly beautiful moans
with their primal, daggerlike finger-pointing, so gut-wrenchingly
honest about such important shit and I knew at once that I was a billion
miles away from having the balls to express myself like that, and
that I had an overpowering need to do so. A need that I was way too
embarrassed to admit to anyone yet, and was too scared to understand
myself. Why did I need an audience so desperately, that I
would risk busting out of the isolation of all my disgust with life, and
share it? I felt like a twisted court jester without an audience.


My father had just died and I was mortified at having all of these
unresolved feelings about his deathâ€”and most everything else.
Most troubling to me, the little things in life, like who I was, what I
wanted, what I'd do with myself, how I'd make a living, how to stay
in the relationship with my college sweetheart without feeling like a
fake, and, well, let's face it, I was a cafeteria of doom.


My bell-bottoms were the only sweet reminder of how blissful
things had been just a year earlier when I was finishing up my glorious
stint at Ohio State, and my dad still paid for everything. I made
some lifelong friends there and I never had to think about death or

I found myself in one of a thousand different flats after college
graduation, fairly broke, yet never broke enough to not gather up
enough bread to buy anything by a former Beatle, especially
Lennon. Somehow on this particular, soon-to-be-revelatory day, I
was off from the many odd jobs I was doing at the time. My girlfriend
was in school teaching her elementary kids and I was alone
with John. As I think back now, it wasn't much different from the
incredible rush I felt hearing Hendrix for the first time, in that this
too was an extraordinary experience. With Jimi I was just blown to
smithereens. With John I was frightened by the rigorous honesty
and personal intensity. But as exhilarated as I was by the music and,
in particular, the lyrics, I was also intimidated, because I knew I had
so many similar feelings, and I knew also that, for me, it wasn't
enough just to realize it. I felt the burden, immediately and in some
powerful way, of trying to express all of this pain artistically somehow.
Being a spectacular "class clown" made my sense of artistic
direction easy, but I never realized how all-consuming it would be. <i>I
was going to be a comedian</i>. Wow. I was going to be a comedian. I didn't
become one for a while, but the seed was planted.


I walked around in a stupor for so long, before there was even a
dim light ahead of me, but I smelled the blood of potential audiences
listening to me moan and groan with the occasional punch lines
thrown in. I had always felt trapped within myself; a man imprisoned
and paralyzed by feelings of loneliness and completely clueless
as to how to even begin to get out of this dungeon I found myself
traveling in. My torture chamber was furnished with a tremendous
amount of anger and neediness, and must have been built long
before I knew I had the right to be myself.


But as soon as Lennon's music resonated in my head, I felt
instantly free when for the first time I ever gave it a thought that little
old me, Richard Lewis, could possibly say publicly how I felt,
even if it might be harder to accomplish if you weren't a Beatle.
Wild, man. Go public. Imagine? All the people. Go figure. What a

I had a need not just to work out my fears alone or with a shrink
or even just with an overly sympathetic lover, but to work them out
with absolute strangers. Paying customers no less. People who could
hang me for my sheer audacity and self-centeredness. I needed to
win over everyone who hadn't hurt me.


Street corners seemed too crazy and dangerous, plus I was afraid
of the big moths that hung around those street lamps, so nightclubs
seemed like a very cool alternative.


It was like I needed people to coddle me and tell me that I was
okay for feeling so bad, so hurt and alone, and that everything
would be all right. And somehow it made perfect sense that just as
long as they laughed at me, I could be saved.
