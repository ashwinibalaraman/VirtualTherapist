<font size="4"><b>An Open Letter of Apology to Practically All of the Women I Have Ever Gone Out With</b></font>

... And with whom I somehow found myself in the uncompromising
position of saying "I Love You" to, knowing full well that it
would never work out. However pitiful and grandiose this seems to
be, first off, let me just say, I <i>am</i> pitiful and grandiose. When I try to
be myself around women, these character defects alternate with one
another like evil twins, each selfishly jousting to be crowned with
the victory of love, so the other is saddled with making up the
excuse to get out of love once I've achieved my victory. I'm not too
proud of this but historically, when it came to sharing real intimacy
(or more importantly, trusting it from a girlfriend), I've always felt
safer figuring out how I was going to take care of myself than I did

The only thing I'm certain of now is that I had more to do with
why things never worked out than any of you could ever have
dreamt <i>I</i> didn't even know. No one told me, until now. It was shocking
that I sort of heard this so late in life, but I did, and once I
accepted it, I felt this need to come clean as soon as I got the bloody
news. I'm leveling now! I have no fear! I have already lost too much
time to lose any more! Look, this isn't easy, so take it or leave it
because if you're out there, <i>this Bud's for you</i>.


Yeah, yeah, I know, too little, too late. But it wasn't until last
week that someone told me this about myself. Let's just say a little
birdie told me. (This sounds like a lot of bullshit but I'm just trying to
honor my doctor-client privilege.) And I figured that for any of you
who are still alive and holding a grudge (having bought this book to
see if you could spot yourself) this shrink-aided epiphany may help.
It made me realize that somehow, some way, I'd left my teenage
years and entered adulthood petrified about deserving to have my
own free will and exasperated with my overpowering drive to feel
my own authenticity. Couple that with my <i>Shaq</i>-sized paranoia that
any woman would—if I really let her in and she got close enough to
me—kidnap my spirit. I am so desirous of experiencing a life companion,
yet so crippled by the brainless fear that any one, any size,
any color will sap me dry of who I want to be. So strangely enough,
I either found a frighteningly safe haven in suffering the indignities
of being fucked over by angry women or was lulled into a comalike
existence by people-pleasing chicks who spun me around in so
many directions that all the pleasing canceled itself out. <i>Oh, baby</i>,
give me that dictator to tell me I'm a piece of shit or that weakling to
tolerate my excesses. Either one.


And even more pathetic is that while neither of these types of
women gave me much pleasure or hope on any consistent basis, I
still made them feel loved, I think; although deep down, I had no
intentions of ever really coming through for any of them or being

If this is any consolation to any of you who are still smarting from
my dysfunctional departure, perhaps you might like to know that I
suffer from frightful, recurring nightmares of cross-dressing. I propose
to myself in a mirror. The male part of me (out of costume)
considers this. I ask the "pretty me" to sit down and relax. Maybe I
even consider ordering out for some food, because I'll easily need a
couple of years to decide whether to accept. Then the "she" part of
"me" takes a handgun and with firm conviction, aims it right at my
head and says in a scary whisper, "You told me that you loved me,"
and then fires! Happy now? Good. Enjoy it? Terrific, because the
moron misses me in every dream and I go on to better things: I get
counseling for this brief, experimental, "dark sexual period" and
somehow move on to become a sexaholic and a "groupie" for every
hot, killer-looking, heterosexual, single (I do have <i>some</i> scruples) ball
player in the Women's National Basketball Association. Though you
will no doubt be pleased to see me with the point guard of my
dreams, considering how much taller she'll probably be than me,
and how she'll perpetually have to look down at me in some sort of
metaphoric state of condescension.


Well, that's all make-believe, just like my whole life with women.
Play-acting. I've been nothing but a child. Nothing but a kid in a
candy store, looking for one sucker after another. I can't tell you all
how sorry I am. I guess I just had to reject you before you would

God bless all of you and may you find a lover and companion
who is willing to accept the fact that, as incomprehensible as it still
seems to me, a loving relationship takes two people. Ciao.
