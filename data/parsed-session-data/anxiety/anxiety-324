In this chapter, counseling principles
guiding the therapeutic processes in working with Asian men are addressed.
Although much has been written and documented regarding generic
characteristics of the Asian population in the United States, there has been
little written specifically about the effects the impact of gender has on
influencing the processes of therapy. It is our hope that future research will
validate some of the clinical observations and findings presented in this
chapter.


<b>Awareness of Differences</b>


An accurate awareness of differences
means voluntarily giving up one's own perceptions temporarily in order to
gain access to another person's gestalt. Stereotypically, Asian male figures
in the majority white society have been depicted in films and in the public
media in less than favorable light. For example, old and not so old war
movies often depict Asian men as unfeeling, sadistic, cowardly, more
animalistic than human. Old TV series such as <i>Bonanza, MASH</i>, and
<i>Happy Days</i> presented caricatures of Asian men emphasizing and making
jest of their use of broken English, their physical stature, and their
manners. Therefore, having a basic awareness of one's own bias regarding
Asian males is an integral starting point in becoming effective in counseling
with this specific population. In order to understand this important process
leading to self-awareness, ask yourself these questions: (1) What have my
reactions been when I have encountered an Asian-American male, be it in

<b>Generalizations About</b>


<b>Asian Men</b>


Traditionally, in Asia men are perceived
to be the favored gender. In the context of Confucian tradition, men
are seen as being the carriers of their family names and kinship linkages, as
well as carrying the heritage of the family tradition. In addition, the order
of birth takes precedence, even among males—old over young, the
firstborn over the succeeding—in terms of relative authority and level of
responsibility. In countries such as Japan, China, and Korea, where the
male is regarded as the culturally more favored gender, such a cultural
orientation pervasively affects Asian men's intra— and intergender relationships
and interactions.


The gender-role dichotomy is more structurally than functionally
defined. Often, the man assumes primary responsibility as the breadwinner,
the economic provider, and the decision maker when relating to the
broader linkage among family, kinship, and society. For instance, if one
had parents in need of ongoing health care, usually it is expected that the
sons—particularly the oldest one—will assume primary responsibility in
caring for the adult parent. (However, his wife may be the actual person to
functionally carry out the responsiblity.) The Asian man may encounter an
identity crisis of sorts if he doesn't perform this expected role competently.


Coming from male-dominated societies where social responsibilities are
carried out by male members, Asian men tend to relate to other men much
more comfortably. In certain important matters, they are discouraged
from disclosing themselves to women because it violates the normative
expectation of not revealing inner feelings, particularly if they reflect
weaknesses. Asian men in general have difficulties in submitting or
subjugating themselves to an unknown person unless that person's
authority is clearly understood and appropriately negotiated. Knowing
one's place in society is imperative in a culture where "saving face" is always
of the highest priority in any interaction.


Thus the Asian cultural emphasis on formal interpersonal relationships
versus the much more informal and spontaneous nature of Westerners can
often make Asian men uncomfortable relating to Westerners, who show by
their actions a lack of understanding and therefore respect for the cultural
differences.

<b>View of Mental Health</b>


The roles of the clinical psychologist,
psychiatric social worker, and nurse in most Asian countries are quite
different from those found in the United States. In the United States,
individuals from these different professions take active roles in the
diagnostic interview, treatment, planning, and psychotherapeutic treatment.
In most Asian countries today, the physician continues to be the
primary caregiver. As compared to the United States, psychotherapy, or
"talk therapy," still barely exists in Asian cultures. For example, what we
call group psychotherapy in the United States is described as mass
education in China and group dialogue in Japan. Since emotional
problems or difficulties still are not culturally acceptable, many psychiatric
problems of Asians are often manifested through somatic complaints. The
symptoms of anxiety and depression, for example, are often attributed by
these patients to a defect in the kidney, hormonal imbalance, or malnutrition
(Pedersen, 1981). Therefore, the Asian men's expectation of treatment
is often a medical solution.


In times of crisis, Asian men have a tendency to search for or use
traditional indigenous means to release their conflictual feelings rather
than directing their problems to the mental health professionals. They may
choose various social settings such as bars, restaurants, tea houses, or
clubhouses where they seek comforting companionships and advice.
Group songs, chanting, or regressive behaviors are often elicited to
produce catharsis of repressed feelings, resentment, anger, grief, or even
erotic excitement. Such intermediary processes serve as a therapeutic
approach that facilitates corrective feedback or curative factors without
having to fear any personal attack, embarrassment, or the trauma of "loss
of face." Other indigenous methods may include massage, herb medicine,
tea ceremonies, the martial arts, or meditation.


Another example can be drawn from Japanese management practice,
which is currently studied and tested in America. Supervisors/ supervisees
or executive/professional staff join together in an informal setting where
repressed feelings can be released and any distressful matters or interpersonal
conflicts are resolved in a familiar atmosphere. Using this kind of
informal social contextual approach to problem solving is seldom available
to Asian men from the contemporary therapeutic communities. Many
recent immigrants or first-generation Asian men often find themselves lost
in searching for these customary ways of problem solving or conflict
resolution.

<b>Therapy and Asian Men</b>


Therapy with Asian men does not
require that a therapist necessarily develop new skills. The fundamental
skills in being an effective therapist remain the same, such as being able to
hear what the client is trying to communicate, accepting the client's view of
distress, communicating this understanding in an acceptable manner, and
developing treatment goals that take into account the client's level of
functioning, resources, and environmental conditions. What is different is
that the problems are presented by Asian men.


It is often postulated that treatment efficacy is dictated by good
assessment of the client and his or her presenting concerns. Accurate
assessment of the interaction between readiness level and degree of
acculturation, which include issues of culture, gender, and social content of
the Asian-American male client, is crucial in determining success or an
early dropping out of treatment (Kleinman, Eisenburg, &amp; Good, 1978).


Asian-Americans in general are confronted with two important issues
that affect their identity development and mode of problem solving. The
first is the direct conflict of traditional Asian cultural values, such as filial
piety and conformity, with traditional American values, such as individualism
and independence (Sue &amp; Kirk, 1973). The second is the impact
of racism, which is sometimes overt, sometimes subtle, but ever present and
pervasive in American society today (Kitano, 1973; Sue &amp; Kirk, 1973). As a
result of these two issues, a number of Asian-American personality types
have evolved, ranging from the individual who may reject or deny all
aspects of being Asian to a radical individual who may espouse a new Asian
consciousness while rejecting the traditional values of both Asian and
American cultures (Chen, 1981; Sue &amp; Sue, 1971). With each type comes
distinct ways that problems are perceived, addressed, and resolved.


Asian-Americans who have been born and acculturated in the United
States are often confronted with an acute conflict between identifying
themselves as primarily "Americans" and their appearance to others as
primarily "Asian" or "Oriental," curtailing being accepted as belonging to
this country. Thus an important variable to assess immediately in working
with Asian male clients is ascertaining whether that Asian male is a recent
immigrant or first, second, third, or fourth-generation American born, and
the degree to which he has acculturated and assimilated into mainstream
Anglo values and perceptions. Sue and Sue (1971) have proposed a
conceptual acculturation and assimilation model that can be used as a
guide to assess where a particular Asian man may be in terms of self-identity,
self-worth, and clinical expectations. They label these three

[p. <i>184</i>]

First, Asian males may remain loyal to their cultural roots by retaining
traditional values and expectations. The traditionalist Asian males are
oftentimes the most recent immigrants, having spent their primary
developmental years within their native culture. They can also be first-,
second-, third-, or fourth-generation-born Asian-American males, who,
having been brought up in a predominantly Asian community, have
accepted the values of that community as their own.


Second, Asian males may attempt to become over-Westernized as a
eans of solving the bicultural dilemma. These transitional Asian males
define their self-worth by how well they have acculturated into white
society. However, in their attempts to find acceptance, they are often
forced to reject the Asian side of themselves and thus become rejecting of
anything that reminds them of being different, including customs, values,
behaviors and even physical appearances.


Third, Asian males may define themselves as Asian-America. Like
transitional males, Asian-Americans are also rebelling against the cultural
conflict, but the emphasis is on the development of a new identity that will
enable them to reconcile viable aspects of their heritage with selected values
of the majority white culture.


<b>Therapeutic Implications</b>


Depending on where that Asian-American
man may be in terms of self-identification, the therapist will
address himself or herself to different presenting problems as manifested by
the traditionalist, the transitionalist, or the Asian-American. Generally
speaking, the therapist or counselor most often is confronted with
addressing the problems of guilt and shame and lack of openness in the case
of the traditional Asian male; to problems of independence and self-hate in
the transitional Asian male; and to issues regarding racism in society with
the Asian-American male (Sue &amp; Sue, 1971). A therapist who works with
an Asian man with a strong traditional orientation must be aware that
when the traditionalist seeks counseling or therapy, this often indicates the
person is experiencing intense feelings of shame and guilt, admitting that
problems exist that cannot be handled. Thus therapists working with males
from a traditional background will often be called upon to alter their usual
style of counseling and therapy.


In American psychotherapy, there has been considerable emphasis on
the therapist as a neutral, nonjudgmental, noncritical, relatively passive

[p. <i>185</i>]

In working with the transitional Asian male, the therapist has an
obligation to help the client sort out his identity conflicts. Specifically, the
transitional male must be helped to distinguish between positive attempts
to acculturate and the rejection of his own cultural values (Sue &amp; Sue,
1971). For the therapist to work effectively with such an individual, he or
she must be conversant with the culture, history, and experiences of Asians
in America. It would also be erroneous to assume that, with such a person,
a therapist of an Asian background would work best, realizing that this
client is in the process of rejecting his ethnic identity. There might be the
risk that the counseling process would terminate prematurely if that person
were to work with an Asian therapist.


As in the case of the traditional Asian male, the presenting concerns of a
transitional Asian male may be physical, that is, not "I feel depressed or
anxious," but rather the physical symptoms of depression and anxiety such
as complaints of frequent headaches or of having stomach problems.
Again, it is very important to utilize a concrete, directive type of communication
approach and minimize open-ended questions. To go after
the underlying constructs initially will probably have a tendency to
scare off the client and again lead to premature termination.


It has been found that very few of the men in the Asian-American
developmental stage utilize any type of mental health services because of its
identification with the status quo (Sue &amp; McKinney, 1975). When they do,
they are usually suspicious and hostile toward therapists, especially if they
are non-Asian. Before any type of therapy can proceed effectively, the
therapist will generally have to deal with certain challenges from these
Asian-American males. For such a client, any defense on the therapist's
part of white society or any explanation of the value of therapy would
certainly arouse greater hostility and mistrust. It would be extremely
difficult to establish rapport without some honest agreement on the racist
nature of American society. Often it has been shown that there is a parallel
between growing pride and self-identity and the notion of accepting having
emotional problems (Sue, 1981). The following guide (see Table 12.1)
highlights and summarizes these differences, as well as the possible
therapeutic approach set to utilize in working with the Asian male
population.

As can be seen, one of the major principles in working with Asian-American
men, be they in the traditional, marginal, or Asian-American
stage of development, is that an approach that is too confrontative or
emotionally intense at the onset of therapy can increase the level of shame,
and therefore result in premature termination of therapy. It is more
effective in establishing a therapeutic alliance if the therapist, guided by
some understanding and knowledge of cultural factors, responds to what
may be viewed as superficial problems and takes the opportunity to
establish rapport and trust. A second principle is the importance of
confidentiality between therapist and client. A frequent concern of many
Asian men is that their friends, and particularly their parents, will find out

[p. <i>187</i>]

The following case vignettes illustrate some of the aforementioned
cultural implications that arise when working with Asian males.


<b>EXAMPLES</b>


A bright male student of Korean
ancestry, majoring in clinical psychology, was thought to be suicidal. He
had an outstanding academic background prior to coming to the United
States as a graduate student. While studying under a different curriculum
structure in the United States than he was used to, he began to exhibit
unusual behaviors. His exhibited problems involved alienation, noncommunication,
and deterioration in his academic performance. He simply
closed up. There was no acting out of the experienced distress. This became
a great concern for the faculty members and his peers. They tried to convey
this concern to him through written communication, phone calls, and
attempted visits but without success. As time went by, he was more and
more unconnected to any meaningful social contact, further complicating
his situation.


This is a case where potential suicide was conjectured as a very imminent
possibility. His most recent problems included: (1) not picking up his
paychecks for a couple of months; (2) not submitting his papers on time;
and (3) consequently his academic status being in serious jeopardy. Before
his professors made any academic decision, they contacted the student
counseling service. Because of the cultural ramifications in his situation,
the case was referred for consultation.


In the Korean environment, his sense of equilibrium was well maintained
and his intellectual and social functioning were never challenged. His entire
previous school experience had been one of reward by people at all levels.

[p. <i>188</i>]

In establishing a therapeutic relationship, the counselor picked an
informal setting where comfortable conversation was possible. The initial
focus was on the client's competence, reconstructing his ego sphere from a
perspective of his previous life. His sense of current failure in another
cultural setting was not customary and had not been easily incorporated
because of his heightened anxiety defense system. Thus he was unable to
deal with his current reality appropriately.


For the first time, the client had been existentially challenged in his sense
of competency, as well as his total outlook on life. He could not handle such
a generalized sense of failure, nor could he relate this situation to his own
ethnic peers. Because his pride was at stake, he could not relate his feelings
to any American peers. He was already determined not to reveal his
feelings, as long as the relationship remained superficial. Inhibited in
approaching faculty, who are customarily perceived to be authorities, it
was almost taboo to unload his own personal difficulties on them. His
loyalty and respect for faculty members made it even more difficult for him
to engage himself while in the middle of his own internal struggle, causing
him to distance himself from establishing mentorship relationships. As a
result, he could not communicate his inner feelings and his sense of
frustration to anyone, leaving his traditional crisis management and
cultural adjustments untouched.


In addition, he chose not to communicate his remorseful feelings and
sense of failure to his wife back home. Being separated from his wife and his
family for several years, he could not reopen his emotional ties. He felt he
had lost control and was reaching the edge in a very dangerous existential
journey.


If he had chosen conventional ways of problem solving and conflict
resolution, he could have prevented his current crisis by using new coping
mechanisms and strategies. Through the use of a therapeutic consultation,
he reconstructed his ecological system and he was able to change his
distorted perception and generalized anxiety over his sense of failure. He
began to realize the simple fact that people conditioned by different
cultures do have different behavior manifestations. Differences are neutral,

[p. <i>189</i>]

After he was assured that the faculty was genuinely concerned and was
willing to alter the system so he could maximize his talents, he was
successful in reestablishing his sense of equilibrium, as well as regaining his
former reputation in this new environment. This situation required a
reciprocal accommodation process, which was essential for achieving a
successful outcome in this consultation. Mutual accommodation released
him from his heightened anxiety and sense of failure, allowing the
restructuring of his perceptions and a reconnecting with significant others,
faculty, peers, as well as his own ethnic group members.


As a result of this consultation, the subject was able to share more freely
the difficulties encountered in a foreign country and in mastering a second
language. He realized that his competency in formal cultural settings was
not readily transferable to his present cultural context and required
adjustment on his part and on the part of those assisting him.


In another case, an 18-year-old Asian male attending a large midwestern
university was seen at the counseling center at the request of his academic
adviser due to a sudden change in his overall academic performance from
first to second quarter. He was the oldest of three children, born and raised
in a small community in Ohio, where his father worked as an engineer and
his mother stayed home to attend to the children. Both parents were
first-generation Japanese. The parents had always held high expectations
for their oldest son and consequently transmitted these values to him. Ever
since he was a little boy, his parents had determined that he would go to
college and become a physician, scientist, or engineer—jobs that they held
in high regard.


Throughout his early schooling, he was a model student, being
constantly praised by his teachers. He displayed stereotypic qualities of
being hardworking and obedient, never causing problems for his teachers.
Going to a predominantly white school, he quickly used his athletic
abilities to find acceptance among his peers and to offset any racial
discrimination.


He exhibited a great deal of anxiety at the initial counseling contact. A
look of surprise was evident when he discovered that the counselor was also
Asian. He found it difficult to talk about himself in a personal way. It
became quickly apparent that he felt a great deal of shame about having to
come to a therapist, and particularly uncomfortable about being seen by an
Asian counselor.


Without directly confronting him about his feelings, the counselor
recognized his stage as being transitional and initiated action for him to be
seen by a white male counselor. When told of the plan for him to see
another counselor for follow-up sessions, he asked how many counselors at

[p. <i>190</i>]

Further exploration by the second counselor revealed significant
sources of conflict. First, he felt his declining grades meant he was letting
his parents down. Second, he had always been interested in art and music,
but felt these areas to be unacceptable professions to his parents. Third,
pressure to graduate as soon as possible to minimize financial drain on the
family was constantly emphasized. Fourth, for the first time he had
experienced rejection solely based on his ethnicity, when he was turned
down by several fraternities, and by several white coeds who would not
date him because he was Asian. His resentment and shock at being treated
differently and the perceived restrictions about his career choice were
originally denied and repressed. When he was able clearly to see his anger
and hostility toward his parents, much of his physical complaint of
frequent headaches vanished. The recognition of having to deal with issues
related to his identity and to the impact of racism initially made him
extremely depressed and ashamed. After some initial working through the
process of supporting him emotionally and providing a safe environment
to present a cognitive map of what was occurring with him, he was able
slowly to work out of his depression and guilt. The Asian counselor was
gradually reintroduced into the therapeutic process to further bridge the
internal split that had formed to create the blind spots. Concurrently, his
grades improved as progress was made.


As illustrated in these two cases, the therapist must not only have some
sense of understanding and knowledge of the different cultural patterns
and perceptions held by Asian male clients, but also must be clear as to
differences that exist between traditional Western counseling models and
the value/belief orientation system underlying an Asian's model for
interpersonal relations and his mode of problem solving. Only then can
effective counseling transpire.
