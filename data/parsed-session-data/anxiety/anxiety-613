<b>I</b> can't breathe.


Air goes in and out of my lungs, but I still feel like I'm suffocating,
like there's an elephant sitting on my chest. It's been
happening on and off for weeks, maybe longer. At first I thought
it was an allergy or asthma, so I didn't worry about it too much.
Then for a few days I thought I had lung cancer, but since I wasn't
coughing, I figured I was safe. This morning, my chest feels tight,
and I think I'm having a heart attack.


I sit in the doctor's waiting room reading an outdated <i>People</i>.
A smartly dressed woman walks up to the receptionist and loudly
announces, "I am here for my eleven o'clock appointment," employing
a tone that says they better not keep her waiting. I remember
when I used to be that demanding, that self-important.
It seems like a hundred years ago. Now I sit and wait patiently,
trying to catch my breath.

[p. <i>201</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387566-I00208&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"It'll be just a few minutes," the receptionist tells her. "We
have a patient who is having chest pains and needs to be seen
right away." The receptionist motions to me, and the woman
with the eleven o'clock appointment eyes me suspiciously. I
drop <i>People</i> on the table and follow the receptionist through the
white door.


They take my temperature, measure my blood pressure, extract
two vials of blood from my arm, and ask me to blow repeatedly
into a tube. While I'm waiting for the doctor's entrance, I
notice that my chest is not as constricted as before. I'm starting
to feel better. I'm starting to feel stupid about coming here.


The doctor comes in with a clipboard and a folder that I
recognize as my medical records. I've averaged one visit here
a month for the past four months: I poked my eye and came in
for pain medication, then I came because I was having trouble
with double vision, which turned out to be a symptom of exhaustion.
And I was here twice last month, convinced that I had
breast cancer.


"Your blood chemistry is normal," the doctor says, "and you
seem to have good lung function."


"I'm actually feeling a little bit better now," I say. "But this
morning I thought I was having a heart attack."


He listens to my heart, my breathing. He thumps my chest
and my back. He even hooks me up to an EKG machine and carefully
watches the jumping needles while assuring me that it is
rare for pre-menopausal women to have heart problems.


"You've been under a lot of stress," he says. "I know you are
against taking antidepressants. But maybe you should consider
taking a break. A small vacation might do you a lot of good
right now."


At least it will keep me out of his office.

[p. <i>202</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387566-I00209&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"How about we go on vacation?" I suggest to the kids.


"I don't want to go," Matthew says immediately.


Nikolaus slips easily into the role of peacemaker. "You don't
even know where we are going yet," he says. "We could go somewhere
really fun."


Matthew crosses his arms. "I don't want to have fun."


Nikolaus sighs.


My mother calls me every Sunday. "You and the boys should
get away," she encourages. "Why don't you come home and see
your family?" In a moment of weakness, I agree. Even though
Elisabeth lives on her own, I don't feel comfortable leaving for
two or three weeks without her. She doesn't love the idea, either.
"If you guys die on the plane, I don't want to be left alone," she
tells me. So I invite her to come along.


When we arrive in New York, the temperature is 95 degrees
with 98 percent humidity. Waiting for the rental car at Kennedy,
I feel like I'm in a steam bath. The oppressive heat is not helping
my breathing problems at all, but I don't want to alarm the kids,
so I pretend that I'm feeling just fine.


My uncles live ten minutes from the airport. When the wind
is right, the noise from the planes landing interrupts conversations
and forces you to turn up the volume on the TV. Today,
though, their house is quiet except for the hum of the window
air conditioner.


My Uncle Babe spent forty years in the restaurant business,
and today he's prepared a spread that proves it: cold poached
salmon, fresh corn, tomato-and-mozzarella salad, and chocolate
cake. "You don't want a real drink," Vincent says, pouring me a
glass of iced tea. "You still have to drive."


I ask Elisabeth if she wants to go lie down, but she says she
prefers to sit at the table with us. The fact that the boys ate lunch

[p. <i>203</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387566-I00210&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The uncles ask Elisabeth what she hears from her sister in
Germany. They ask about the Miners' health. Nikolaus, of course,
doesn't mention that his grandmother had called him just before
we left to ask if I was forcing him to move to New York. And I am
not admitting to anyone, myself included, that this trip might be
a good chance for me to see if moving back home—nearer to family
and cheaper housing—might not be such a bad alternative.


"Call your mother," Vincent says to me. "She'll be worried."


"You better get on the road soon," my mother warns when I
call her. "I don't want you to drive after dark."


The uncles won't be talked out of packing sandwiches and
sodas for the trip even though the drive to Pennsylvania will
take no more than three hours and we have just eaten. They also
provide a map and detailed directions, although it is a trip I've
taken hundreds of times and could probably do blindfolded.


Once in the car, I decide on a whim to cut through the city
instead of taking the more direct route through Brooklyn and
over the Verrazano Bridge. <i>We're explorers, here to see the sights</i>,
I think as we head across the Long Island Expressway toward the
Midtown Tunnel. <i>We are starting a grand adventure</i>.


In the city, Saturday-night traffic is light, and I make a
quick swing up Sixth Avenue past Rockefeller Center to Central
Park. The hansom cabs line up at the park entrance, but Matthew
is less interested in the horses than I expect. We head back down-town
on Fifth past St. Patrick's Cathedral and the great lions of
the Public Library.


Matthew perks up as we pass the Empire State Building. "Can
we go up to the top?" he begs. "Please?" But parking is difficult,
and I'm afraid that Elisabeth can't make the trip to the top.


"Another time," I promise.

[p. <i>204</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387566-I00211&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

South of Houston, the streets of the financial district are
largely deserted, and we swing past the World Trade Center and
head toward the building on Maiden Lane where my father worked
for many years and the restaurant on Pearl that my grandfather
owned, which was sold out of the family years ago. These last
sights are included in the tour for my benefit; I don't expect they
will make much of an impression on the boys or Elisabeth. But
they are touchstones for me, vague memories of a distant past,
the starting points from which I can measure how far I've come.


Matthew is fascinated by lower Manhattan. "Do they make
money there?" he asks as we pass the Stock Exchange. "Do they
let people live here?" He remains glued to the window as we head
back up toward the Holland Tunnel.


It is almost nine o'clock when we arrive at my mother's
house. We find her in tears. "Where have you been?" she sobs.
"I've been frantic."


I decide it's better not to mention the detour through the
city—which, in any case, added no more than an hour to the trip.


"I've called the highway patrol several times," my mother goes
on. "I had visions of you all lying dead on the side of the road."


It's going to be a long three weeks.


After a week of visiting with my mother and sisters, the boys and
I pack up and head to Stone Harbor, on the Jersey shore. We leave
Elisabeth with my mother—she doesn't like sun, sand, or swimming,
and I need a break from being fussed over by older ladies.


"Can we stop at the Empire State Building on the way?" Matthew
asks, but I explain that we're going the opposite direction.


I head out with high hopes. I long to escape the oppressive
humidity and breathe in cool ocean breezes. As a child, I spent a
week each summer at the shore, and I was anxious to share this
experience with my children: Swimming in the buoyant saltwater.

[p. <i>205</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387566-I00212&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had originally thought of going to Cape May, but I knew
the kids wouldn't enjoy the quaint bed-and-breakfasts that predominate
there. I settled instead on the town of Stone Harbor
because I remembered it as being more family-oriented.


"I don't know what kind of hotel you'll find down there," my
sister had warned. "Most people rent houses." Indeed, the hotel I
booked is far less comfortable than I had hoped. The room is so
small that the two double beds butt against one another, but the
bathroom is clean and there is a small slice of ocean view from
the three-foot-wide balcony. Plus, I don't have to cook meals, and
the maid comes daily to make the beds and provide fresh towels,
so it feels like a real vacation.


We pin the temporary beach badges the hotel provides on
our swimsuits and head down to the shore, which is blazing hot
and suspiciously empty. "Isn't this great?" I chirp. "We have the
whole beach to ourselves."


"My feet are burning up," Matthew complains, "and there is
a lot of gross stuff down by the water."


Great clear blobs dot the sand at the water's edge and jiggle
in the ebbing tide. Nikolaus stoops to investigate. "Jellyfish," he
declares. "Millions of them."


"Cool!" Matthew pokes tentatively at one with his finger.
"Can we eat them?"


"Don't touch it!" I shout, pulling his hand back. "It will sting
you," I explain, more calmly.


We retreat to the hotel pool, which is where we find the
crowd. The pool is very small and full of chubby, sunburned children.
All the lounge chairs are already occupied by women in
gold lamé or rhinestone-studded swimsuits and red manicured

[p. <i>206</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387566-I00213&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"But there's waitress service," I say, trying to make the best
of a bad situation. I order frosty drinks for the kids and sit on the
side of the pool, dangling my feet in the filmy, lukewarm water,
sipping my mai tai. The kids go in the pool just long enough to get
wet, then decide to go back up to the room and watch TV. I order
another drink and spread my towel on the concrete behind a row
of lounging women, far enough from the splashing crowd to stay
dry but close enough to hear the distant sound of the waves and
eavesdrop on the women's conversations. I am breathing easier.


"Harry's played golf for three days in a row," one lady whines
to another. "Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the kids."


A bleached blond is saying, "I think I'll go to the outlet mall
tomorrow, even if I have to lock the kids in the room. I hear they
have Gucci."


Her friend says, "I'm going with you, and I'm going to buy
myself something really nice. That schmuck I married is going
to pay. He was supposed to take the kids to get ice cream three
hours ago."


My chances of joining in on a conversation with these women
are slim to none. What would we have in common? They sound
like they want to kill their husbands. I just buried mine. We have
different goals. I came here hoping to spend time with my kids,
and they came here hoping to escape them. I leave my drink unfinished
and head up to the room to see what my boys are doing.


I had planned to stay at the beach for four days, but by day
three, we've all had enough and are ready to leave. We've played
miniature golf on a small course on the roof of a gift shop, bought
T-shirts, eaten cotton candy, and spent at least twice the money
on carnival games than the few prizes we've won would have cost
at full retail. We spent an entire day on the boardwalk, riding the

[p. <i>207</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387566-I00214&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As we're leaving the boardwalk, Matthew begs for one last
ride. There is a small steel roller coaster, a kiddy ride, near the
exit. Nikolaus says he's had enough, so I climb into the small car
with Matthew. On the first turn, the car abruptly turns sideways,
and I am jostled against the side. I feel something snap. A sharp
pain shoots through my side and is exacerbated by every twist
and turn we take. My screams of pain blend seamlessly into the
joyful screams from other riders.


Back at the hotel, I look for a bruise, but there is none. Based
on the level of pain, I figure I must have cracked a rib. Breathing
is now not only difficult, it's painful. I wish that Nick were here
to take care of me. He'd go to the drugstore for me and get me
some Tylenol. He'd be the one walking up and down the aisles
right now looking for some kind of bandage or brace that would
ease the pain so that I could drive home. I wish that Nick were
here to drive us back to my mother's, but he's not. Nikolaus loads
the luggage in the car. I stay in the slow lane of the turnpike the
entire way back, trying to keep my torso still, hoping that I won't
have to make any sudden painful turns.


We get back to my mother's house in the late afternoon.
She's upset because I didn't call her every day while we were at
the shore.


"We were only gone for three days," I protest.


"You should have called to let us know that you were still
alive," my mother says stiffly. "Elisabeth and I were out of our
minds with worry." The two of them sit at the dining room table
drinking coffee and eating apple cake. Apparently, all the worry
hasn't affected their appetite.


"I live three thousand miles away and don't call you every
day. I'm sorry, but it never occurred to me to call you daily from
fifty miles away."

[p. <i>208</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387566-I00215&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mother takes another bite of cake and then continues
as if I hadn't spoken, "And you never even called to tell us when
you were coming back. Now the kids are probably starving, and
I have no dinner ready."


"Don't worry. We ate some burgers on the way."


She ignores me, focusing her attention on Elisabeth.
"Luckily we have a lasagna in the refrigerator. I know the kids
love lasagna."


"Thanks, Mom. That will be just perfect." What else can
I say?
