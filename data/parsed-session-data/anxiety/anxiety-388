<font size="4"><b>16: Bent But Not Broken Exploring Queer Youth Resilience</b></font>

Why is it relevant to include a chapter
on lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_185');">[note]</a><div id="_note_185" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. The politics of language deserve mention in
our choices of words throughout this chapter.
Although it is not our intention to blur the distinctions
of lesbian, gay, and bisexual identity or to
depersonalize identity, we have chosen for simplicity
of reading to abbreviate our language to LGB.
Alternately, we use the term <i>queer</i> for the same
population.</div>
youth in a text on resilience? What
are the reasons for drawing a connection
between the lives of LGB youth and the theories
of resilience? In most ways, after all, regardless
of where they live, queer youth are just like
heterosexual youth: They come from all ethnic,
religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds,
and they share the same skills, interests, and
physical attributes (Savin-Williams, 2001).
They grow up both within and outside of families
of origin, they navigate popular culture demands
and peer dynamics, they cope with disappointments
and uncertainties, and they prepare for
their futures. Yet the contexts within which these
developmental experiences occur are fundamentally
different.

Transgendered youth are not included in this chapter
given the distinction adopted that transgender relates
to gender orientation and not sexual orientation.
Beyond this, there are additional layers to societal
context, including intolerance when there is discrepancy
between biological sex and gender expression.
These different expressions of intolerance require
closer examination that is beyond the scope of this
chapter.</div>
So are the challenges LGB
youth face. A few examples follow:

This chapter begins with a review of the
sociopolitical context in contemporary North
American society as it relates to homophobia
and heterosexism, then moves to an exploration
of significant challenges faced by LGB youth
in an effort to locate how this population creates
and enacts resilience. Resilience herein is
defined as an ongoing process of engagement
between self and community, consisting of series
of interactions and reflections that contribute
to surviving adversity and living well (Ungar,
2004). The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Youth
Project, located in Nova Scotia, is highlighted as
an example of programming that opens spaces
for young people to experiment with and experience
ways to cope with threats to them that result
from their sexual orientation. The life stories
of young people involved with the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Youth Project are woven through-out
this chapter, connecting salient points in the
literature with the lived experience of youth.

<b>Homophobia and Heterosexism</b>

Any discussion of the lives of LGB youth must
necessarily begin with analysis of the context of
homophobia and heterosexism that has been and
continues to be pervasive around the world. The
challenges faced and particular coping strategies
chosen by LGB youth do not result from individual
pathology or deficiency but, rather, have
to do with oppressive societal conditions associated
with heterosexism and homophobia. By
context, then, we mean the social and political
conditions surrounding the lives of young LGB
people that bring with them unique meanings
and consequences to those lives. At the same
time, we recognize that both homophobia and
heterosexism are themselves human creations,
or constructions, borne of particular, prevailing,
and legitimized belief systems, or dominant ideologies.
In this chapter, the concepts of context
and construct are closely linked, given that the
societal <i>contexts</i> within which LGB youth live
are comprised of societal <i>constructs</i>.


A term coined by the psychologist George
Weinberg in the late 1960s, <i>homophobia</i> is generally
defined as the irrational fear and hatred of
gay, lesbian, and bisexual people, their behaviors,
choices, and lives (Weinberg, 1972). It has
also been taken to include any belief system that
supports negative myths and stereotypes about
same-sex attraction and couples (Mihalik, 1991).
The reported intent of this definition was to
remove stigma from the LGB person and, rather,
pathologize the person holding the antigay attitudes
and beliefs. However, there have been
difficulties with the concept since the outset.


Some researchers, notably psychologists,
assert that to use the <i>phobia</i> suffix implies a psy
chological condition, which is not primarily the
case here. Others have argued that, given the
ideological and societal context that supports
misinformation about, exclusion of, and intolerance
toward LGB persons, there is little irrationality
about these negative attitudes and
beliefs. Indeed these attitudes and beliefs are
reinforced in myriad ways, and use of the term
homophobia, given its focus on individual
thoughts and feelings, diverts attention from a
necessary macroanalysis of institutional and
systemic prejudice toward LGB persons.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_7204');">[note]</a><div id="_note_7204" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">4. This debate is simplified here; however, the
interested reader is directed to Herek (2000) for discussion
and inclusion of other terms (e.g., <i>homonegativity,
homohatred</i>, and <i>sexual prejudice</i>) as
alternatives.</div>
Unlike classic phobias, homophobia has some
basis in a logic that has been construed and constructed
and that has a distinct political agenda
(Eliason, 1995). Expressions of homophobia
range along a continuum from attitudes of
exclusion and intolerance to verbal targeting
and harassment to physical manifestations of
assault and murder. Rather than the personal
opinions of a subset of the general population,
the prevalence and meanings of homophobia
have profound social significance and intersect
in complex ways with patriarchy, sexism, and
heterosexism.


<i>Heterosexism</i> refers to institutionalized and
cultural homophobia: the legitimization of prejudice
on the basis of nonheterosexual orientation
through overt social practices and systems
and covert social mores and customs (Appleby
&amp; Anastas, 1998; Herek, 1984. 2000; pharr,
1988; Sanders &amp; Kroll, 2000). Dominant ideologies
regarding sexual expression, behavior,
and identity assert the preference of heterosexuality
over other alternatives. Beyond social
mores and customs, heterosexism refers to the

<b>Roots of Homophobia and Heterosexism</b>

The meanings and implications among heterosexism,
homophobia, patriarchy, and sexism are
overlapping and expansive, and they all begin
with recognition of the use of power and control
to establish and maintain dominant ways
of thinking.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_9958');">[note]</a><div id="_note_9958" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">6. Given the parameters of this chaptet, intersections
among race and class relative to those noted
are not explored here. The reader is directed to the
resources of hooks (1984) and Collins (1990) for this
exploration.</div>
A sociopolitical analysis suggests
that, in Western thought, power is embedded
within the notion of hierarchy; that is, power of
one idea, person, or thing <i>over</i> another, resulting
in oppression and "othering" of the entity on the
lower end of the hierarchy. Oppression, the core
concept of which is "press," is both outcome
and process: It consists of collective personal
experiences located in the structures that determine
and maintain a particular ordering of
societal relationships. "Something pressed is
something caught between or among forces andbarriers
which are so related to each other that
jointly they restrain, restrict or prevent the
thing's motion or mobility" (Frye, 1983, p. 2).


Oppression is at the same time overt, blatant,
and unmistakable, as well as insidious, covert,
and easily overlooked. "It is organized violence
at the top that permits individual violence at
the bottom" (Weick &amp; Vandiver, 1982, cited in
Dalrymple &amp; Burke, 1995, p. 15). It is the manifestation
of an ideology so pervasive that for
the dominant, at least, it can go unrecognized,
both as process and as outcome. Ideology, political
systems, and economic structures form a
powerful triumvirate of social control.


This weblike system of restraint and immobility
requires classification into easily discernible
categories and the ordering of such categories
within a hierarchy that confers superiority and
inferiority. Domination allows for a systematic
valuing of human worth, wherein the powerful
are bestowed with the positioning and authority
to include or exclude based on this determination.
Privileges and normative expectations are
ascribed according to one's role within the hierarchy,
and the perpetuation of the hierarchy is made
feasible through the development of social systems
that see such ordering as natural and, in
Christian cultures, God given. Exclusion inherently
necessitates othering, the designation for
those who are deemed without merit for inclusion.


It has been suggested that the social system
within which children first learn about differential
access to power, which is the gravity for
societal values, is in the family home (hooks,
1984). It is here that children learn about status,
voice, representation, relationships, and positioning
relative to power, as well as the manifestations
and consequences of choices that
comply with or contradict uses of dominant
discourses of power.


It is in this form of the family where most children
first learn the meaning and practice of hierarchical,
authoritarian rule. Here is where they learn
to accept group oppression against themselves as
non-adults, and where they learn to accept male
supremacy and the group oppression of women.
Here is where they learn that it is the male's role
to work in the community and control the economic
life of the family and to mete out the
physical and financial punishments and rewards,
and the female's role to provide the emotional
warmth associated with motherhood while under
the economic rule of the male. Here is where the
relationship of superordination-subordination, of
superior-inferior, or master-slave is first learned
and accepted as "natural."(hooks, 1984, p. 36)


Within this analysis, two relationships begin
to emerge more clearly. First, there is a conceptual
and practical relationship between heterosexism,
homophobia, and sexism The family
system described above indicates the subtle yet
pervasive reinforcement of compulsory heterosexuality,
gender role distinction, and the risks
of nonconformity within this paradigm. Where
heterosexism is the ideology and homophobia

[p. <i>266</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00304&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sexism is the principle underlying this
configuration: elaborate cultural, societal, and
economic structures designed to denigrate the
female under male superiority (Frye, 1983;
Pharr, 1988). Same-sex affection and attraction
practically (if not ideologically) reject such a
notion, therefore inherently challenging the
bases on which society is meant to maintain
itself: patriarchy, heterosexuality, and sexism,
hooks (1984) asserts that sexism is the site of
domination experienced by most people, either
as oppressor or oppressed, and that we experience
it before we know or experience other
oppressions. Ideologies of sexuality and gender
are woven within and around sexism: Expectations
for gender roles and heterosexual activity
are communicated overtly and covertly and are
the ways and means through which girls and
boys learn the values, beliefs, and customs of
conventional masculinity and femininity. Some
say that to be heterosexual is to meet the basic
expectation of gender socialization, given that,
from the outset, regardless of the other charac
teristics one has, choices one makes, and behaviors
one engages in, if one does not conform
with being heterosexual, one is already violating
the dominant discourse of gender (Appleby &amp;
Anastas, 1998).


Unlike other social prejudices, homophobia
and heterosexism are most often first learned in
the family home. Contrast, for example, that
experiences and awareness of racism and classism
are generally first encountered on entering
the outside social world (Blumenfeld, 1992).
Home can remain, then, a haven to which to
return for a sense of shared identity, culture, and
meaning, a place to combat the ignorance, hostility,
hatred, and violence prevalent in the wider
community. No such comfort is ensured in the
home of LGB youth, who include this divergence
in family identity as a significant source of
distress and isolation (Flowers &amp; Buston, 2001).

<b>The Centrality of Context</b>

Analysis of this societal landscape is critical to
understanding the context within which LGB
youth live their lives and must precede discussion
of the risk factors faced and coping strategies
employed by this population. A research
focus on alcohol and drug abuse, suicide, selfharm,
and prostitution, devoid of analysis of the
societal context of heterosexism, homophobia,
patriarchy, sexism, and the call to comply with
conventional and narrow gender expectations
dangerously and inappropriately pathologizes
and segregates LGB youth. Being LGB is not
inherently reflective of psychic distress, mental
illness, or other social problems, yet LGB
people have often been "studied" as a problematic
population, on the basis of engagement in
the above-named behaviors. Alternately, LGB
youth have been subsumed within the heterosexual
youth population out of ignorance.
Neither approach is cognizant of, nor responsive
to, the myriad ways through which LGB youth
resist oppression and enact their resilience.


Much as we recognize and assess evidence
of the many societal constructs that marginalize
and oppress LGB young people as central
themes in our analysis, we are wary of casting
these features as nonnegotiable and rigid in
their impact on society's citizens. Young LGB
people's lives inform us on a daily basis that
these structures are not irrevocably fixed. At the
same time as acknowledging and fully appreciating
their weight, we need to appreciate the
lived reality that LGB youth can and do act
to transform their situations as a marginalized
group and maneuver for better positions on a
daily basis. Every day, LGB youth find ways to
overcome the structural obstacles that permeate
society, as the stories included here attest. Thus,

[p. <i>267</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00305&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Some theorists posit that young LGB people
are growing up in a social climate less oppressive
than earlier generations, with qualitative
data suggesting that some LGB youth consider
themselves more alike than dissimilar to their
non-LGB peers (Eccles, Sayegh, Fortenberry, &amp;
Zimet, 2003). Furthermore, the diversity of life
experiences within this and any other population
means that experiences of life obstacles, ideologies,
and societal structures necessarily vary
from person to person, according, minimally, to
ethnicity, class, and gender (Savin-Williams,
2001). There is great diversity among this population,
and we are wary not to invoke an essen
tialized "community" of LGB youth. We do not
assume that what difficulties one faces, all will
face, and in the same manner.


Homogenizing of the LGB population has
occurred on three notable levels. First, subsumed
under a macro youth narrative, there has
been the homogenization that all young people,
variously aged between 12 and 19 years, are
considered to be developmentally progressing at
the same time and speed, regardless of the social
locations of race, class, and sex. Early research
and modular development theories of identity
formation during adolescence exemplify this
trend (see, e.g., Erikson, 1963, 1968). Second,
studies that compare LGB youth with heterosexual
youth imply through their design that
the two populations are distinct. Such research
wrongly labels youth as LGB or as questioning
or same-sex attracted, which may or may not
connote homosexual orientation (Savin-Williams,
2001). Third, studies related to LGB youth have
frequently applied findings of studies with gay
boys to lesbian girls, erasing the implications of
sex and gender.


Finally, we resist the draw to characterize
the lives of LGB youth as fully knowable and
reducible to discrete variables revealed for our
examination, although much of the literature is
organized in this way. Although there can be great
understanding facilitated, solidarity achieved, and
comfort generated through the predictability
and certainty available by quantifying the rich
experiences of people's lives, in so doing we run
several risks.


First, the task of categorizing or labeling a
person is vulnerable to making one-dimensional
a multidimensional life and assuming a fixed
rather than fluid identity. There are some who
assert that affixing any category as well as abbreviating
that category is to further oppress the
LGB person, for that which we choose to name
becomes prioritized, and the choice is inherently
political.


<blockquote>
<p>
To be "gay" means belonging to a class of individuals
who are subject to hate crimes, prejudice
and stereotypes it is to be expected that some
adolescent might choose to describe not their
sexual identity but their sexual desires or attractions
(e.g., "I'm attracted to women"). (SavinWilliams,
2001, p. 11)
</p>
</blockquote>
As a parallel point, many researchers have
asserted that sexual identity and same-sex
attraction are evolutionary phenomena and that
traditional identity development models, including
coming-out models (see, e.g., Cass, 1979;
Troiden, 1989), suggest a linear progression
and causal relationships that are not useful for
spiral, reflective learning and living processes.
Although we have surveyed the literature and
we include life story vignettes, and we hope that
this exploration is helpful in understanding
the layers of richness that may contribute to
resilience among LGB youth, we fully embrace
that there is no one way to "live well" within
one's environment.

<b>Heterosexism and Homophobia: Where They Can Lead</b>

Expressions of homophobia and heterosexism
stigmatize, isolate, and thereby traumatize LGB
youth during critical stages of their development
(Bagley &amp; D'Augelli, 2000). Correspondingly,
many LGB youth speak of their adolescence as
a time filled with anxiety, isolation, and fear.
Experiences of homophobia and. heterosexisin put
LGB youth at risk for dropping out of school, suicide,
drug and alcohol abusej physical and verbal
abuse, homelessness, and prostitution (Bagley
&amp; Tremblay, 1997; D'Augelli, Pilkinglon, &amp;

[p. <i>268</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00306&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Because homophobia and heterosexism
continue to be largely unchallenged in contemporary
society, LBG youth frequently face overt
discrimination without intervention from others.
The Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education
Network's (GLSEN) survey of LGB and transgender
students across the United States
reported that 83% had been verbally harassed
and 42% had been physically harassed in
school, with 84% of high school students hearing
the words <i>faggot</i> or <i>dyke</i> in the classroom
frequently or often (GLSEN, 2001). Concluding
their study, they assert that despite the benefits
of sexual diversity education, schools remain
reluctant to address lesbian and gay issues, particularly
in curricula aimed at youth aged 12
to 16 years (GLSEN, 2001). Another American
study concurred with these findings, with 86%
of the students reporting that school officials
"rarely or never" challenged this type of harassment
(Peters, 2003). The international group
Human Rights Watch reported in 2001 that the
public school system in the United States had
repeatedly and uniformly failed to protect LBG
and transgender students (Human Rights Watch,
2001). Correlated with this abuse and lack of
validation from school staff, LGB, transgender,
and questioning youth are 2 to 5 times more
likely to drop out of school than their heterosexual
counterparts (<i>Nuggets</i>, 1998).


The heightened rate of suicide among LGB
and bisexual youth has been well documented
in the literature (see, e.g., Bagley &amp; Tremblay,
1997; D'Augelli et al., 2000; Remafedi et al.,
1991; Remafedi et al., 1998). Gibson (1989)
found that in the United States, lesbian and gay
youth make up between 30% and 60% of all
completed youth suicides. In Canada, a study at
the University of Calgary found that LGB youth
are 13.9 times more likely to commit suicide
than heterosexual youth (Bagley &amp; Trembley,
1997). Factors including social isolation, lack of
affirming and validating support services, alienation
from family and friends, and gender nonconformity
have been noted as contributing
to this heightened suicide risk. D'Augelli et al.
(2000) assert that "gender atypical" males
encounter more physical and verbal abuse
related to their suspected sexual orientation than
do males who conform more closely to society's
concept of masculinity and are therefore
better able to "hide." Remafedi et al. (1991) and
Remafedi et al. (1998) have linked gender nonconformity
and subsequent homophobic abuse
to an increased risk of suicide.


The predominance of research supports the
notion that most LGB youth are aware of their
sexual orientation early in their adolescent
development, with many self-identifying by the
age of 16 (Ryan &amp; Futterman, 1997). However,
many of these young people do not disclose
their orientation to others until later in their lives
because of fear of stigmatization and harassment.
This is particularly true in the case of
disclosure to family members (D'Augelli,
Hershberger, &amp; Pilkington, 1998). Research has
shown that the majority of these young people
face mistreatment by family members after their
sexual orientation is disclosed. As a result, many
are either forced to leave home by their family
or choose to leave because of safety concerns
(Savin-Williams, 1994). There are corresponding
elevated levels of homelessness among this
population: conservative estimates indicate that
25% to 40% of homeless youth are LGB (Ryan
&amp; Futterman, 1997). It is anticipated, however,
that this percentage is significantly lower than
the reality because many of these young people
choose to "mask" their orientation out of fear
of further stigmatization (Ryan &amp; Futterman,
1997). There is also evidence of some LGB
youth turning to work in the sex trade at least
initially as a means of economic support and
finding a place to belong (Banks, 2001;
Tremble, 1993).


Several studies have highlighted the incidence
of substance abuse among LGB young
people. LGB youth may turn to use and abuse
drugs and alcohol for varied reasons, including
managing stigma and shame, denying same-sex
feelings, or as a defense against ridicule and
violence (Garofalo, Wolf, Kessel, Palfrey, &amp;
DuRant, 1998; Orenstein, 2001; Ryan &amp;
Futterman, 1997).


A critical factor to consider in understanding
the experiences of LGB youth is the relative

The above examples are included here not
for the purposes of underscoring a message that
being LGB is hazardous to physical, emotional,
and psychological health, for this is not the case
(Savin-Williams, 2001). Rather, their relevance
is in highlighting that negative effects emanate
from lack of support and resources, externalized
homophobia, internalized homophobia, selfconcealment
of sexual orientation with the requisite
alterations in behavior, and the stresses of
coming out in an often hostile environment
(Banks, 2003).

<b>Local Stories of Living Well</b>

The sociopolitical context of heterosexism
and homophobia, the foundations on which they
are built, and their manifestations, have been
discussed above. Given this context and these
consequences, we need to ask some questions:
Is there such a thing as queer resilience? Are
there resilient characteristics or experiences
held or faced by LGB youth and unique negotiations
between LGB youth and their environments
that may encourage resilience? Are there
programs and services or support that can nurture
latent resilience in LGB youth? If there are
such programs, what can be learned from them?


To approach these questions, we sought the
voices of LGB youth regarding their definitions
and experiences of resilience. We used both
interviews conducted as part of our clinical work
with these youth and research specifically on the
theme of resilience. All the youth were members
of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Youth Project
("the Youth Project") of Halifax, Nova Scotia,
Canada. Their stories are included here. This
method of data collection was chosen given
the imperative to isolate the concept of queer
resilience according to the language and lived
realities of queer youth themselves. We begin,
however, with an explanation of the scope of
services provided by the Youth Project as a way
of demonstrating the context that must necessarily
be established if LGB youth are to be given
the opportunities to advance socially, academically,
and psychologically unhindered by the
barriers imposed on them because of their
sexual orientation.

<b>The Youth Project: Creating a Context for Resilience</b>

In spite of the specific and daunting impediments
detailed above, the daily lives of LGB
youth inform us consistently of perseverance,
courage, and commitment to self-worth. Expressions
of this resilience have been witnessed
through the Youth Project, which was begun in
November 1993 as a field placement for a bachelor
of social work student at the Maritime
School of Social Work, Dalhousie University.
The Youth Project was conceived and developed
to meet needs of LGB youth that were then
unmet by other youth-serving organizations.
Initially, the Youth Project was composed solely
of two support groups, both for individuals
25 years of age and under--one for gay and bisexual
men, the other for young lesbian and bisexual
women. For several years, it was run fully by
volunteers and supported in-kind by Planned
Parenthood Nova Scotia. Incorporated as a non-profit
society in Nova Scotia in 2002, the Youth
Project is an independent, charitable organization
society governed by a board of directors
and a youth board of directors, with a provincial
mandate and staffed by two full-time employees
and numerous volunteers.


The mission of the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Youth Project is "to make Nova Scotia
a safer, healthier, and happier place for lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgendered youth through
support, education, resource expansion and community
development" (<a href="www.youthproject.ns.ca">www.youthproject.ns.ca</a>).
One of its key features is the involvement,
of youth at all levels of the organization, as
reflected in the board governance structure. In

Over the past decade, the programs and
services offered by the Youth Project have grown
into three service areas: support services, education
services, and social opportunities. Over the
years, countless stories and experiences have
been shared. Many are captured here in an effort
to explore queer resilience in ways that may
expand understanding of the broader resilience
construct.


<b>Support Services</b>


Support Services offered at the Youth Project
include confidential individual and family
counseling, safe housing, HIV testing and preand
post-HIV test counseling, the facilitation
of a province-wide Ally identification program,
and biweekly support groups. The counseling
service is offered free of charge to young people
and their families, with referrals primarily made
by self, family members, and school personnel
and contact occurring in the youth's home community,
across the province. Although most
youth access the support services for issues
directly relating to sexual orientation, many
access counseling for a variety of other issues.
They speak of choosing the Youth Project
because the mandate makes clear that barriers
due to homophobia and heterosexism will not be
encountered. Jade, age 17, says this of her experience
visiting the Youth Project:
<blockquote>
<p>
After that first time coming down here, I left here
thinking, "Wow, a whole house, a whole place";
they come in and do workshops and are like a
guiding hand, so many resources I had never
seen people so out, and this whole house, you
know, all the gay stuff, I hadn't seen that before
it was something new and I liked it, so I just kept
coming back, like all the time, and I would read
about it, and ask around.
</p>

A component of the Youth Project, the Safe
Home Program, addresses the reality that young
LGB people experience homelessness as a result
of feeling unsafe, at risk, or not supported in
their home living environments, a situation generally
precipitated by the severe isolation and,
often, by violence provoked by the prevalence
and expressions of homophobia. Homeless by
this forced choice or by the actions of family
members, LGB youth find that the Safe Home
Program provides supportive living environ-ments
through which to complete educational
goals, develop a positive sense of self, and gain
skills necessary to make a healthy transition
to adulthood. Robert's story is typical of many
youth who participate in the Youth Project out
of the necessity to deal with threats to their
well-being:
<blockquote>
<p>
Robert was 16 when he first contacted the Youth
Project, referred by a psychologist he was seeing
to help cope with the homophobia experienced
in his rural community. Robert was being taunted
by his classmates and threatened on a daily basis
after he was "outed" to his school by his best
friend. One day Robert was chased home from
school by five classmates. When they caught him,
they shot him numerous times with a pellet gun.
Robert no longer felt safe in his community and
moved into the Safe Home Program. He stayed in
the program for 9 months during which time he
completed high school and became employed.

The literature is replete with accounts from
LGB youth who say that fear of homophobia
prevents them from trying to access support
from teachers, guidance counselors, physicians,
and other adults in their lives. The Ally Card
program was developed by the Youth Project
to identify affirming and inclusive individuals
whom young people can approach for support.
An ally is someone who accepts, appreciates,
and celebrates LGB youth--someone of any
sexual orientation who commits to work along
side the Youth Project to eradicate the discrimination
and fear that LGB youth experience.

[p. <i>271</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00309&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In addition to the above efforts, one of the
bedrocks of the Youth Project is the provision
of biweekly support group meetings for LGB
and transgendered youth. Groups are held in
Halifax, a community of 300,000, and in rural
communities throughout the province. These
groups provide opportunities for youth to come
together for education and peer support as
directed by the expressed needs of the youth who
attend them. Facilitation is provided through
trained adult volunteers.


Tamryn started coming to the support meetings
when she was 15 years old. At first she didn't
speak much, but slowly she began to form connections
with other group members. After coming
to the meetings for about a year, she brought her
mother into the Youth Project to meet the staff and
volunteers. Her mother thanked the staff and volunteers,
saying that Tamryn had changed dramatically
since coming to the meetings. Her grades
had returned to the A level they had been prior to
her coming out, and she was no longer depressed.
Both Tamryn and her mother attributed these positive
changes to connections she had made with
peers at the support meetings.


<b>Education Services</b>


The Youth Project provides several services
to young LGB and transgendered people
to facilitate reaching educational goals. These
services include advocacy within the education
system, free tutoring, support, and information
in decision making with regard to postsecondary
education, job search skill development, and an
on-site school program.


As discussed above, LGB youth have
reported feeling unsafe and not validated within
their community school environments. As a result,
many choose to drop out of school, despite identifying
school as an important aspect of their
lives (Peters, 2003). The Safe Classroom program
began in 2002 as an alternative school
environment for LGB and transgendered youth.
This structured day program facilitates the
completion of high school credits in a classroom
setting with the support necessary to return to
a mainstream school environment or graduate
from high school through an off-site collaboration
between the Youth Project and a local
school board. The Youth Project also provides
an annual bursary to a LGB or transgendered
youth pursuing postsecondary education.


Chris had transferred to three different schools in
one academic year because of the homophobia
he faced from his classmates. He heard about the
Youth Project Safe Classroom program from
friends and applied. In his meeting with the Youth
Project Education Coordinator, it was realized that
he only had four courses to complete in order
to graduate. He enrolled in the classroom program
and completed his courses and obtained his high
school diploma. He is now taking a year off and
working before deciding what postsecondary
institution he will attend.


Education services also include community
education workshops on homophobia and
heterosexism and their effects on LGB youth.
Interactive workshops and professional development
training are conducted in a range of environments,
including junior and senior high
schools, youth-serving organizations, and university
classes. Topics range from creating safer
school environments to meeting the counseling
needs of LGB youth. There are also educational
opportunities, either group or individual, to gain
information on a variety of topics, including
safer sex practices, spirituality, healthy relationships,
coming-out issues, and any other topic
identified by the youth. As one youth commented
after a school presentation, "Thanks so
much; that was the first time I've heard anyone
say that what I experience every day [the homophobia]
is wrong."


<b>Social Opportunities</b>


Queer youth often face extreme isolation.
Given the prevalence of homophobia and heterosexism,
many do not have the opportunity
to socialize with other youth, and when they do,
these experiences may bring with them yet more
fear of violence and intimidation. The Youth

[p. <i>272</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00310&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During a retreat that was held in Montreal during
Pride Week, Bobby, who was about 23 years old,
was found sitting on a curb. One of the facilitators
sat down and asked him what was wrong. He
looked up and with tears streaming down his face
said, "This is the first time I ever felt I truly
belonged anywhere The first time."

<b>Understanding Queer Resilience</b>

The lives of queer youth present rich examples
of resilience when their well-being is seen as the
result of ongoing negotiations between themselves
and their environments. Despite a societal
context laden with structural and ideological
challenges and family environments often precarious
with regard to acceptance and validation,
queer youth regularly locate the personal
and community resources to maximize their life
opportunities. How does this happen?


Peirson, Laurendeau, and Chamberland
(2001) assert, "Protective mechanisms (conditions,
circumstances, characteristics of person or
environment) serve to enhance the potential for
resilience" (p. 58). These features can be found
at the levels of the individual, family, and gay
and ally community. This section explores our
emerging thoughts on a pattern of queer youth
resilience that reflects both the constraints and
opportunities to be found in the current societal
context, the literature, and the stories of youth as
heard through the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Youth Project. We identify key components that
contribute to experiences of living well.


Invoking the language of "protective factors"
requires a few provisos. First, we note that our
intention is not to suggest these are binary characteristics,
representing either "good" or "bad"
traits. Furthermore, we accept that there can be
no distinction that a young person either <i>has</i> or
<i>does not have</i> these characteristics; they exist
along a continuum and within each person to a
greater or lesser degree. In addition, we are not
suggesting that these features are not available
also for straight youth; they are not "gay" characteristics.
At the same time, these features do
seem to combine in unique ways in the lives of
LGB youth to produce experiences of queer
resilience.


<b>Truth in Being</b>


To begin, there is in the literature documented
evidence of a sense of entitlement that queer
youth carry that contributes to their belief that
they deserve to express truth in their being.
There is a prerogative, or a right, to feel fulfilled
in life and a corresponding choice to manage
appropriately what Lance, a 16-year-old project
participant calls "the sexual orientation stuff."
Associated with this entitlement is a sense of
personal agency covertly evidenced through the
stories youth tell about themselves. These stories
are full of accounts of forward momentum
and an action orientation toward self-acceptance
and making the choices required to be "out" as
LGB. Rob, age 17, asserts,
<blockquote>
<p>
Coming out, to me, was a lot more than just
affirming my own sexuality. It was saying, "This
is who I am and I don't care about what others
think." I know that is about my sexuality, but it
changed every dynamic of my life--<i>every</i>
dynamic. One morning it just clicked and it was
like, "You don't deserve this at all these
people don't know you." Not even my parents,
they don't know me; very few people know me. If
I don't get respect and validity. I don't deal with
that person. It's like, "Hello. I know what I'm
talking about. I know who I am."
</p>
<p>
When I came out, that's when I started to give
myself some respect and validity and when I came

out, that's when I started to look at everyone else
and said, "Well if I can give it to myself, then they
can too." When I came out I started to give myself
respect, and the more respect I gave myself, the
more I got not letting people walk all over
me, standing up for myself, stuff like that.

There is evidence that youth who have familiarity
or experiences with autonomy and selfreliance
may be prepared to work with the
isolation or "covering up" that is required of
many youth who have not yet come out.
Although they may not <i>enjoy</i> the self-reliance or
might not have sought it out otherwise, familiarity
with being on one's own in some area of
one's life is reported as one of the experiences
of queer youth that may be linked with
resilience features on the individual level. Jade
shares her thoughts:
<blockquote>
<p>
I think if you can overcome the adversity of, you
know, being a target, when you are gay or lesbian
or bisexual growing up, it lends itself to resilience.
You know, if you can overcome that, then you can
overcome a lot of other things because you have
been through that adversity already and you have
tackled, you know, isolation and unacceptance and
being alone If you have to go through all of that
conflict, then that would build you. And people
grow up being targeted even if no one knows--you
are still affected by all those messages.
</p>
<p>
I guess my resiliency comes with just constantly
separating what I do and where I work and who
I am from my family and my relatives. I guess
they're proud of me, and I have this fear that that
would go away that's going to all stop if they
find out, so I keep it away.
</p>

Experiences of youth who are participants in
the Youth Project also suggest there is a personal
orientation toward rejecting the negativity and
myths promoted by heterosexism and homophobia.
This rejection seems to parallel a theme,
heard throughout the Youth Project stories, of
being true to oneself and seeking to be true in relationships
with others. Carmella notes, "The word
<i>normal</i> is bullshit anyhow it's a place in
Idaho. There are 14,000 normal people, that's all."


Miguel, age 29, captures the quest for living
true to oneself when he says,
<blockquote>
<p>
Coming out was the most difficult, the most
painful time of my life but also the most liberating,
crazy time but the alternative [to not coming
out] was worse. I couldn't achieve or live my
life in the closet I was doing up my resume
and listing all this great stuff, and I looked at it and
went, "None of this is mine this is all what
other people want me to be." I needed to be true to
myself but also true to my relationships. I was so
afraid I would lose my family, but more important
there was no bright future. Coming out looked
more real. I could start negotiating stuff. And
I remember the good stuff about coming out.
All of a sudden I was so light.
</p>

All of a sudden I was so light.


<b>Family Characteristics</b>


In theorizing family characteristics that contribute
toward resilience, we note that there are
overlaps between community and family. In
addition, although most often, family stories
refer to the youth's family of origin, we recognize
that not infrequently a young person's
family of choice is the family they refer to when
they speak of their experiences with their
families. Families that respond in a welcoming
and affirming manner to the coming out of their
children necessarily contribute to family-related
resilience among LGB youth (Savin-Williams
&amp; Dube, 1998). This experience has not been
well documented in the literature, nor was it
present in the stories heard through the Youth
Project, which may be indicative of its relative
lack of frequency. More often, one or two
family members may be aware and may be conditionally
supportive, as opposed to there being
full-family acceptance and celebration of the
youth's sexual orientation (Mallon, 1999).
Organizations such as Parents and Friends of
Lesbians and Gays (P-FLAG) may be more
accessible to youth than their own families.
Jade, age 17, recalls,
<blockquote>
<p>
When I was younger I wanted to join P-FLAG,
like before I came out to myself. I just wanted to
be involved and be around families that were okay
with it all. I don't really know why
</p>
</blockquote>


When I was younger I wanted to join P-FLAG,
like before I came out to myself. I just wanted to
be involved and be around families that were okay
with it all. I don't really know why


Some youth suggest that when issues around
same-sex relationships and intimacy remain
invisible, the youth experience marginal freedom

[p. <i>274</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00312&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My family never said anything homophobic;
they didn't say anything at all. So although I didn't
receive any accurate information about being
lesbian, I also didn't have to navigate a load of
antilesbian stereotypes and myths.


<b>Gay and Ally
Community Characteristics</b>


The wider community can play a role in
either hindering or supporting the positive identity
formation of queer youth. Communities
hold the promises of exclusion and violence as
well as promises for inclusion and acceptance.
As Bernice, a transsexual character in the film
<i>Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</i> says, "I don't
know if the ugly walls of suburbia are put up to
keep <i>them out</i> or to keep <i>us in</i>."


The vitality of the Youth Project, expressed
by its members, rests firmly on the platform of
its community features and its role in breaking
the isolation, loneliness, and fear experienced
by many queer youth. Locating and securing the
means to break social isolation, accessing the
gay and ally community, and sharing identity
are cornerstones in naming protective features
that contribute to resilience. Twenty-three year
old Carmella shares that
<blockquote>
<p>
once you're in the gay community, it's like family.
It helped me form relationships, kept me from being
lonely and afraid it connected me to other
people. If I hadn't identified with the people I identified
with, I don't know what would've happened.
</p>
</blockquote>


once you're in the gay community, it's like family.
It helped me form relationships, kept me from being
lonely and afraid it connected me to other
people. If I hadn't identified with the people I identified
with, I don't know what would've happened.


Having a peer group with whom one feels
accepted for one's core identity is an empowering
experience, one that offers validation and
a safe space to be one's self. When one lives
outside the boundaries of what is socially
accepted, youth tell us that there is more room
for self-expression. When one finds in that same
space beyond conventionality like-minded
people, then the LGB youth may be more likely
to encounter encouragement and positive feedback
for however she or he wants to be identified.
Locating and securing safe places to
explore one's identity and its meanings is critical
to fanning the embers of resilience.


Matthew was 17 when he attended his first Youth
Project retreat, held in Montreal during Pride
Week. At the beginning of the retreat, Matthew
said he didn't feel comfortable participating in the
parade that would happen at the end of the week
because he didn't want anyone to know he was
gay. Five days later, as the group prepared to leave
for the parade, Matthew came dancing out of the
cabin where the youth were staying dressed in full
drag and yelling that he was ready for the parade!


As such stories demonstrate, finding a gay or
ally community often brings access to information
that can counteract the messages of heterosexism
and homophobia found in the larger
community. Role models play an important part
in gaining this access. Jade explained, in regard
to her own experience,
<blockquote>
<p>
Some people come here [the Youth Project] and
have no friends whatsoever because they are gay
or not accepted, and they find, like, good role
models here. Some of the older staff are gay
people who are successful, and they are helping
kids who are insecure in who they are, and young
gay kids can see these people who are successful
in their relationships and they see it is not impossible
"I can have that, I can have a good relationship.
I can get married if I want to." They
provide that here. At school they may be called a
freak or a fag, and here they are accepted and
people like you for who you are, and people can
sympathize with what you've gone through
because people have gone through it themselves.
</p>

The iterative and interactive relationships
between self, family, and the gay and ally community
suggested here make up an initial step in

As evidenced throughout this chapter, queer
youth resilience is realized within a society
predicated on homophobia and heterosexism.
Professionals working in this field can become
allies with LGB youth in this work in ways that
encourage and nurture this resilience. We suggest
a few guiding principles for this work based
on the narratives of those youth with whom we
have spoken:
<table>
<tr><td>

Efforts such as these can help create a
healing context for young people who must
navigate the conditions of heterosexism and
homophobia and the resulting oppressions. All
the ingredients required for resilience are available
within LGB youth and our communities.
Making choices to intentionally season and simmer
those ingredients can yield a rich broth of
health and happiness for everyone committed to
a more just and caring world.
