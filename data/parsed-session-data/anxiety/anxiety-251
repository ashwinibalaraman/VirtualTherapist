<font size="4"><b>Chapter 6: Women</b></font>

Despite vilification, exotification, subjugation, and infantilization,
Asian American women have demonstrated resilience. Resilience
reflects a process of adaptation and transformation. In a country and in many
cultures where gender carries a secondary status, women's resilience is remarkable.
This chapter provides an overview of the growing body of psychological
research on Asian American women. An overview of social factors and stereotypes
provides hypotheses as to why research on Asian American women emerges slowly.
Subsequently, the rest of this chapter summarizes the research in five general
areas of existing research: family, identity, sexuality, violence, and general mental
health.


<b><i>Social Factors</i></b>


Demographic and cultural factors might offer partial explanations for the
paucity of research on Asian American women. The most relevant demographic
hypothesis suggests that the small size of this population relative to the rest of
the country would produce few Asian American women researchers. Researchers
in the social sciences often inquire into personally relevant content areas. Few
Asian American women psychologists have been positioned in research institutions.
Concomitantly, until we entered the current "postmodern" era that values
the personal experience and connection of participants and researchers to the
content and substance of the research questions, minority researchers were discouraged
from developing research agendas outside of mainstream psychology.
Consequently, few Asian American female psychologists exist as role models for
subsequent generations of women (Nagata, 1995) or therapists in the mental

[p. <i>212</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00223&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The second demographic hypothesis suggests that the generation of the individual
has a bearing on educational attainment. With the tremendous growth
in the Asian American population over several decades, the typical profile of the
Asian American woman has been transformed. Fujitomi and Wong (1973),
authors of the first psychology chapter on Asian American women, observed that
the average Asian American woman was modally represented by a Sansei (third-generation
Japanese American) or a first- or second-generation Chinese American.
However, the modal Asian American woman now extends significantly
beyond these two groups. The term has even expanded to include Pacific Islanders.
She may be Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, East Asian,
Chamorro, Thai, Taiwanese, Hawaiian, or Samoan. She still may be first or second
generation, but she also may be at least fourth or fifth generation, as we see in
the Japanese American population. She may be multiethnic or multiracial as a
result of the high rates of intermarriage for many Asian and Pacific Island communities
(see Chapter 7, this volume). Extended generations in this country increase
the opportunity for education, which increases the chance of the
educational system producing researchers who will pursue issues relevant to Asian
American women.


These demographic factors may interact with cultural and generational factors.
Psychology seeks to expose the private world of the psyche whether the unit
of study is the individual, the married couple, or the family unit. Cultural proscriptions
across various Asian groups have demarcated private and public lives.
Private lives are not for outsiders to view. A second cultural factor that might
dissuade Asian Americans from going into psychology is the conflict between
worldviews. For those persons who are more closely aligned with traditional
Asian cultures that tend to be collectively oriented, psychology is oriented within
an individualistic framework. Parents might not be willing to finance their children's
educations for a field of study that does not make sense or seems frivolous.
Leong and Serafica (1995) observed the generational conflicts and parental influence
that Asian American parents exert on their children's choice of college
majors. Parents might be concerned with increasing the family's future economic
stability. A psychology major might even feel like a threat or loss to the financial
security of the future family as compared to an engineering or a business major.
With increased financial stability over generations and with acculturation, it seems
that parents are allowing their children to choose their majors. Although Asian
American women have contributed to dual-income families, their work has had
to place family and child rearing first. Thus, until recently, an advanced degree
in psychology was not practical. With increased acculturation, young women
have been able to assert more control over the directions of their lives.

<b><i>Stereotypes</i></b>


Although research on Asian American women need not be carried out only
by Asian American women, "inside" researchers might be able to critically evaluate
prevailing hypotheses, theories, and stereotypes in a way that might even
formulate different questions or interpret results in a different way. Inside information
about culture and gender may challenge stereotypes that might otherwise
turn into self-fulfilling prophecies and guide realities (Chow, 1989). Stereotypes
limit both the behavior to which the observer will attend and the possible meaning
assigned to behavior, cognitions, and emotions.


Never has there existed as much specific legislation toward a broad cultural
group as there has been toward Asian Americans (Chan, 1991). Very specific
legislation has been directed to prevent women from immigrating or assisting in
the development of permanent Asian American communities. The stereotypes
that exist for Asian American women might be analyzed as reflective of sentiments
of anxiety and hostility that ebb and flow with economic depressions, wartime,
and societal transformation. These sentiments are embodied in enduring stereotypes
of Asian American women.


The diabolical, cunning, manipulative stereotype exemplified by the daughter
of Fu Manchu in American films depicts this woman as being immoral and
hypersexual with a penchant for White menâ€”a "dragon lady." She began to emerge
shortly after and concomitantly with economic hardship in which Asian laborers
were accused of taking up jobs that were entitled to American White men and
with legislation barring Chinese women from immigration as current-day mailorder
brides. This stereotype is attributed to assertive Asian American women
who do not cater to men, particularly White men.


A contrasting, nonthreatening stereotype emerged during World War II
through the Vietnam war in which U.S. military personnel were distributed
throughout the Pacific region. World War II brought home the stereotype of the
subservient woman and exotic geisha girl who catered to men's sexual fantasies.
A second nonthreatening stereotype is particularly paternalistic. Asian or Asian
American women are characterized as childlike, fragile, and innocent as in "China
dolls," "Polynesian babies," and "Asian Thumbelinas" (the latter appearing in
some of the reptilian monster movies). These two stereotypes, among others,
combine to produce the "Suzie Wong" stereotype of the "hooker with a heart of
gold" who is portrayed as having a penchant for White men. The main White
character of the same-titled movie, again, is cast in a paternalistic role as a justification
for his attraction and use of this Asian woman.


A different stereotype characterizes the Asian American woman as a laborer,
asexual, and smart and/or industrious. Glenn's (1986) now classic work on three
generations of Japanese American women in domestic service highlights the invisibility
these women experienced in their role as domestics. Some women reported
that when they tired of a job, they could have friends replace them without
their employers necessarily noticing these substitutions or trades. Contemporarily,

[p. <i>214</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00225&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A final stereotype that runs through all the stereotypes except that of the
dragon lady is that of the Asian American woman as passive, subservient, and
deriving her pleasure from domestic spheres. Fujino's (1992) dissertation examined
images of Asian American women by Asian American men and White American
men. Some of this stereotype comes through in the differences between Asian
American and White American men's images of Asian American women compared
to those of White American women. The issue is not whether Asian American
women are more domestic but rather the meaning placed on it.


Thinking about the research available on Asian American women, one must
contend with the tensions between gender roles and their transformation between
and across generations. Many Asian American women must find their way in a
world where they might simultaneously struggle with gratitude to their mothers
for their hardships and feel critical of their mothers' lives. Chan (1987a) reflected,
"When Asian American women speak of their conflicts, they frequently focus
first upon their familial relationships, then [upon] their work relationships, and
only later upon their relationship with the rest of American society" (p. 13). Thus,
separation or challenging of patriarchal structures without rejection of the family
or betrayal of the community can be a tenuous accomplishment.


<b>FAMILY</b>


Few studies have examined Asian American marital relationships; fewer studies
have researched parent-child relationships. However, with time and generational
transformation, the Asian American family in its various ethnic cultural contexts
(e.g., Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese) has changed. When most Asian Americans
lived in ethnic enclaves with multiple wage earners to pay rents, multigenerational
households were common. Although they still exist, many households are comprised
of partners and their children (if they have children). Concurrent with this
transformation of who comprises the household, marriage also has been transformed.
No longer primarily a utilitarian arrangement to ensure settlement in
America and the progeny of the future, love now is a critical and necessary requirement
for entering into most marriages (Takagi, 1988). However, the continued
infusion of immigrants continues to reinforce traditional values while
younger people are quickly acculturating to American values. This juxtaposition
of value systems can be the source of conflict between generations. It often is a
source of discussion in therapy. Homma-True (1990) suggested that therapist self-disclosure
may provide role modeling when working with Asian American women
if the therapist is Asian American.


Gender role expectations of women can vary widely based on class of origin,
current class, ethnic group of origin, and generation in the United States. Furthermore,
many Asian American women will report performing different gender

[p. <i>215</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00226&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i><b>Marriage</b></i>


Communication, designated a key to successful relationships, may have different
definitions and requirements by ethnic group. For example, Card (1978)
found that communication style between Filipino American spouses was situationally
dynamic. Couples tended not to confront problems between themselves
but instead would discuss problems regarding their children. This pattern is absolutely
consistent with Filipino values around subjugating the needs of the self
to the greater good of the relationship. However, being responsible for teaching
children values, parents would need to talk about their children. Agbayani-Siewert
(1991) suggested that as couples become more assimilated and have fewer sources
of support with the diminished proximity to extended families, such styles of
communication as Card (1978) observed might be less effective. Homma-True
(1990) suggested that family therapy might be an effective intervention for adjusting
to changes in gender expectations and general social stress.


Although few in number, empirical marital studies support the hypothesis
that conflicts in gender role expectations and transformations in roles can be a
major source of marital conflict and dissatisfaction. For immigrant groups, class
status changes, struggles with language barriers, and trying to make ends meet
become everyday sources of stress that might interact with shifts in gender role
performance (Loo, 1991). Among a sample of Filipinos in Los Angeles County,
Agbayani-Siewert (1991) found that shifts in sex-role behavior that conflicted
with a spouse's expectations of the performance of gender roles were correlated
with increased marital conflict and dissatisfaction. In a study of Chinese American
couples, Ying (1991) found that 42% of the variance in marital satisfaction for
women, compared to 30% for men, was accounted for by subjective ratings of
life aims, friendships, and communication. The best predictor for marital satisfaction
was sharing goals with partners. In some families, gender expectations
might not include sharing or even communicating goals between partners. In
Southeast Asian communities, women working alongside men and earning similar
or more income changes their relationships with their male partners. Luu (1989)
observed that these changing roles were correlated with divorce, particularly
among Vietnamese. Tien (1994) noted that many of these women, although they
might have worked in their countries of origin, must work in roles that cause
work to be perceived as a "necessary evil."

[p. <i>216</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00227&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i><b>Interracial Dating and Intermarriage</b></i>


Asian American women as a group have the highest rate of interracial marriage.
Several factors account for this: skin color, socioeconomic status (SES),
degree of acculturation, higher education, generation, occupation, income, proximity
to different groups, and small numbers of one group (Adams, 1937; Miller,
1992; Shinagawa &amp; Pang, 1996; Sung, 1990). Rates of intermarriage also differ
by gender, generation, and geographic region of the country. For example, the
rates of intermarriage are extremely high in Hawaii (Kitano, Yeung, Chai, &amp;
Hatanaka, 1984). Geographic differences were summarized by Sung (1990), who
observed that Chinese American intermarriage is highest in Hawaii (more than
75% combining men and women), high in Los Angeles, and relatively low in
New York. However, in contrast to other studies showing that women had higher
rates of intermarriage than did men, the rates for New York Chinese American
men and women are similar. Based on Los Angeles County, Kitano, Fujino, and
Sato (Chapter 8, this volume) reported that generation in this country, acculturation,
time in this country, and proximity to other groups play significant
roles in determining rates of interracial marriage, with women always having
higher rates than men. Each successive generation generates higher rates of inter-marriage.


Although Ho (1984) and Sung (1990) suggested that interracial marriages
would be difficult, this does not necessarily mean that these marriages end in
divorce. Ho and Johnson (1990) examined the longevity of interracial marriages
among residents in Hawaii, the majority of which consisted of an Asian or Hawaiian
partner. The divorce rate was proportionately lower for between-group
marriages (which included some interethnic marriages among Asians and Hawaiians)
than for within-group marriages. Sung's (1990) study of 50 interracially
married New York Chinese showed that the divorce rate was relatively low, 12%
to 18%, compared to a 40% divorce rate for the general population in 1982.


Current theories no longer explore individual pathology as the motivation
for interracial dating or marriage. In fact, Ahern, Cole, Johnson, and Wong (1981)
found no evidence of psychopathology in their study of interracial and interethnic
marriage in Hawaii. However, the women, more so than the men, were less traditional.


Fujino (1992) suggested that interracial dating is partly a response to trading
status by gender and race. Although Asian American women were viewed as less
attractive than their White female peers, they were seen as more obedient, more
willing to do chores, and more willing to take care of men than were their White
female peers (Fujino, 1993), which may be viewed as attractive in a relationship
but not necessarily reality based.


The intermarriage of Asian American women also has long been associated
with war, from the Spanish-American War in the Philippines, to the war brides
of World War II and the Korean war (Kim, 1977), to the Vietnam war. Currently,
the largest source of international brides of Asian origin stems from correspondence
marriages. Controversy abounds around the reasons for these marriages

<i><b>Changes in Family Constellations</b></i>


Patriarchally structured societies seem to place more responsibility on women
for upholding the success and smooth running of the domestic sphere, which
includes relationships. Although divorce is becoming more prevalent in many
Asian American families, the stigma of divorce tends to be greater for Asian American
women than for Asian American men. This stigma originates not only in the
failure to make a successful marriage but possibly also in the failure to fulfill
obligations to one's family and in-laws. Chu (1988) suggested that this pressure
on women might contribute to lower divorce rates, which is what she found in
her analysis of 1980 Los Angeles County census data comparing Asian American
women to other women. Other factors also might contribute to lower divorce
rates. A substantial increase in the Asian American population stems from immigration
since 1965. Thus, it is possible that orientation toward the collective
versus the individual and staying together for the children's sake might contribute
to lower divorce rates. Chu's (1988) Los Angeles County study produced many
interesting results. With lower divorce rates, proportionally fewer Asian women
are single heads of households compared to other groups of women. However,
differences exist between and among Asian groups. In general, divorce was correlated
with generational distance from immigration. For example, Japanese had
higher divorce rates than did Vietnamese. However, Korean women had relatively
high divorce rates. Chu suggested that the familiarity of divorce in the country
of origin also might influence the woman's ability to use this strategy as a solution
to marital dissatisfaction.

Most recently, a new family constellation has evolved, and distress has arisen
over recent immigrating Hong Kong families in which the wives and children
reside in the United States and the husband frequently travels between countries.
These men, called "astronauts" because of the frequency and distance of travel,
maintain business and work ties in Hong Kong. Subsequently, gender-role expectations
are strained as the women, resilient to adapting to the demands for
change, head their households, make unilateral decisions, discipline their children,
and acculturate to American ways of conducting daily life. When their husbands
return, some are able to shift back into the previous method of interaction,
which might include the women deferring decision making or including their
husbands in decision making. However, many women have changed, and conflicts
ensue over their transformation in the performance of gender roles.


<i><b>Generation Gaps</b></i>


Within families, value differences create cultural generation gaps between
Asian parents and Asian American children (Nguyen, 1992; Shon &amp; Ja, 1982).
These conflicts are particularly intense between immigrant generations and their
children raised in America (Nguyen, 1992). Homma-True (1991) found that
mothers bear the brunt of much of this conflict because, throughout their children's
lifetimes, mothers adjust to their children's wishes to move toward the
American middle-class value of autonomy and independence and try to instill
the closeness and interdependency that have value in Asian families (Bradshaw,
1990). Despite distance from immigration, some vestiges of cultural patterns appear
to be evident in child-rearing practices of Asian American women compared
to those of White women (Lui, 1990). Thus, despite acculturation, many culturally
derived values persist, although perhaps in evolved, adaptive forms.


Cultural generation gaps become evident in the conflicts between elderly
parents and their children. Whereas in traditional families it has been assumed
that elderly parents will be cared for by their children, particularly eldest sons
(Shon &amp; Ja, 1982), value conflicts are increasingly apparent regarding this responsibility.
Like women in many cultures, Asian American women have been
socialized to put family first; in operating more from a collective philosophy than
from an individualistic one, not only is caretaking of elderly parents (and in-laws)
assumed but not to follow through with these obligations violates implicit or
explicit role expectations. Yu and Wu (1985) documented gender effects in support
of parents, with daughters (94%) providing support for aging relatives' needs
more often than sons (86%). Although caretaking of elderly parents has been
primarily a son's designated responsibility in many Asian cultures, it often was
and is delegated to the son's wife. Caretaking of elderly parents has become an
issue because most Asian American women work. Furthermore, with a movement
away from multigenerational households and with geographic mobility and acculturation,
although many Asian American women care about their parents,
living and caring for them at home becomes a difficult proposition.

[p. <i>219</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00230&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>IDENTITY</b>


The positive valuation and empowerment of the self as an Asian American woman
is a balancing act in which gender, race, culture, class, and psychosocial aspects
of dynamic senses of self must be integrated in daily life (Robinson, 1993). This
integration might include the different roles one enacts in a day as worker, student,
mother, daughter, wife, lover, and friend. The self as a relational entity also must
achieve a balance between individual needs and significant others' needs (e.g.,
family, partners, children). The totality of valuation of self and identities comprises
the self-concept, which might not be supported by the people and within
all the social contexts in which one operates.


In this balancing act, one must develop reference standards by which to judge
himself or herself and others. The valuation of women, more so than that of
men, places undue emphasis on physical attractiveness. This is a dilemma in a
nation that prizes European standards of beauty. Thus, the desire for approval
from the mainstream culture leads many young people to attempt to divest themselves
of cultural values and an Asian American identity.


A combination of racism and sexism contributes to negative feelings that
many Asian American women have about their racial features (Chan, 1985 ; Hall,
1996) such as small breasts, eye and nose shapes, skin color, straight hair, and
short stature. Although women of color have suffered from being compared to
the European-based standard of attractiveness, perhaps no other group of women
has attempted to change its racial features as much and by as drastic measures as
have Asian American women. They have subjected themselves to eye surgery,
nose construction, and breast implants (Kaw, 1993).


Lack of identity, powerlessness, struggles with self-acceptance, feelings of
diminished worth and diminished attractiveness, and difficulties with assuming
adult roles all are part of the development of chronic eating disorders (Root,
1990). Yoshimura (1992) observed that a history of greater body image dissatisfaction
among Japanese American children and adolescents poses a risk factor
for developing eating disorders. However, neither Yi (1989) nor Yoshimura
(1992) found acculturation to be associated with eating disorder symptomatology
among Asian American women. Ironically, although the petiteness of many Asian
American women is seen as physically attractive, when combined with short
stature, this equates with diminished power and childlikeness. Asian American
women's eating disorders are more likely to include dissatisfaction with or
loathing of specific racial features that are not related to body weight and fatness
but that are projected onto a general feeling of body dissatisfaction, reflecting
the struggles with identity, empowerment, and self-esteem.


Some of the social origins of alcohol and drug abuse are similar to those of
eating disorders. Sue, Zane, and Ito (1979) found that patterns of Asian American
drinking are associated with assimilation. However, Sun (1991) found that the
importance of family identity, restrictiveness of the female role, importance of
moderation, and lack of emphasis on drinking contribute to Asian American
women drinking less than other women and less than Asian American men. This

[p. <i>220</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00231&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Bradshaw (1994) noted that conventional ethnic identity models are not sufficient
to explain how Asian American women accomplish a positive ethnic identity
that asserts equal social value with Asian American men. These models suggest
that at some point, individuals seek refuge in their ethnic or racial communities
to shield themselves from the denigrating messages they receive. However, gender
is another status around which women receive denigrating messages even within
their own communities. Thus, Bradshaw noted that Asian American women must
attain a positive sense of self by maintaining simultaneous contact with a majority
culture that supports their personal achievements and increased freedom as well
as their ethnic group that affirms their ethnic self.


Identity development is further complicated for multiracial Asian American
women. Kich (1992) observed, "The assertion of the self as biracial requires both
the personal organizing structure of a biracial self label and the interpersonal and
social recognition of the individual as biracial. The assertion creates and fosters
a coherent, whole sense of self" (p. 317). However, given the subscriptions to
notions of racial purity and hypodescent rules within some Asian cultures, biracial
women might be marginalized and put through authenticity tests for acceptance
as Asian. Identity is further complicated by the objectification of mixed-race
women (Root, 1994). Valverde (1992) observed the operation of objectification
and oppression by race rules on Vietnamese Amerasian women who are viewed
as prostitutes whether or not they really are prostitutes. Some multiracial women
lost in the identity process might play on their exoticness to gain acceptance from
men or search for acceptance through their sexuality with men.


Many immigrant Asian American women struggle with a loss of satisfaction
and esteem when their specialized training in their countries of origin does not
allow them reciprocal credentials. Subsequently, many women with graduate educations
are working in jobs that require little or no schooling. Some of these
women suffer psychologically for having a lower status, often with a loss of self-esteem.
Yet, other women seem to demonstrate the capacity for resilience and
adaptation to the multitude of changes presented in immigration.


Kanuha (1990) observed the triple jeopardyâ€”sexism, racism, and homophobia
â€”faced by Asian American lesbians. Until recently, there were few places for
lesbians to retreat for recognition of all three significant aspects of their lives
(Ordona, 1994). H. (1989) suggested, "An Asian American lesbian must first strive
to develop a basic sense of self-identity before taking the next step of developing
a sexual identity" (p. 285). Chan (1987b) stated that declaring a lesbian identity
is a revolutionary act in that one does not derive her identity from partnership
with a man. "Coming out" might be accompanied by difficulty in achieving full
adult status in her family's eyes. Adult status often is conferred through marriage
and the birth of children. Thus, the coming-out process is fraught with anticipation
of the loss of benefits associated with an expected role in the family.

[p. <i>221</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00232&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>SEXUALITY</b>


Although there is a history of erotica in Asian countries, only recently have narratives
and anthologies offered information about Asian American sexualities
(Kudaka, 1995; Lim-Hing, 1994). Tsui (1985) observed that certain notions of
propriety and, again, the distinction between private and public selves (Chan,
1994) might preclude certain types of written information on this topic. Chan
(1994) suggested that sexuality subsequently might be a conflicted subject for
young Asian Americans who are influenced by both familial rules and peer behavior.
Hirayama and Hirayama (1986) further suggested that sexuality can be
hard to study because it is both a private behavior and associated with emotion
that often is controlled.


The literature that does exist suggests that Asian Americans tend to be sexually
conservative in outward expressions of sexuality, which can serve to maintain
social order within the family and community (Chan, 1994). This conservatism
is correlated with lower rates of sexually active young adults, as Cochran, Mays,
and Leung (1991) found in comparing Asian American college students with other
ethnic and racial groups. Sexual conservatism makes it difficult to discuss many
topics and may provide a more subtle form of culture generation gap between
youths and their parents. The relative absence of written information on sexuality
until now has far-reaching implications for Asian American women about the
meaning of and right to sex, safe sex, sexual identity, birth control, pregnancy,
and abortion.


Discussion of, much less declaration of, a gay, lesbian, or bisexual identity
can be more difficult in the various Asian American communities (Chan, 1994).
A lesbian identity can run in direct conflict with important cultural values on
children and men. Support networks now exist specifically for Asian and Pacific
Islander American lesbians and bisexuals to negotiate this life experience and to
facilitate a positive sense of personal empowerment and negotiation of gender
roles, ethnicity, and sexual orientation (Ordona, 1994). A woman has many obstacles
to face in trying to negotiate a new role in the family if the family will
allow its members to listen and obtain information to correct their misinformation
about the meaning and origin of same-sex orientations and lesbian identity.


Sexually conservative attitudes also might contribute to some abused women
staying in abusive partnerships for sexual companionship (Rimonte, 1989). Asking
for help regarding sexual information and sexual functioning also could be
very difficult. In addition, lack of information on sexuality and the importance
of preserving the family name might make it difficult to disclose extrafamilial sexual
abuse and rape.


Homma-True (1991) pointed out other implications of the lack of openness
with which many families shy away from sexuality. Although Cochran et al. (1991)
found that unsafe sex practices occurred at similar frequencies in their Asian
and non-Asian American samples, Homma-True (1991) summarized the research

[p. <i>222</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00233&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>VIOLENCE</b>


A misdirected use of cultural sensitivity would be to interpret the dearth of information
on sexual and physical violence against Asian American girls and
women as a positive reflection on cultural values (Rimonte, 1991). More likely
than not, a multitude of factors conspire to keep this evidence from public record.
Traditional Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, South Asian, and Southeast Asian
cultures reinforce power differentials based on gender (Ho, 1990; Kim, 1977;
Rimonte, 1989, 1991; Song, 1994).


The insular nature of the family and cultural imperatives to protect the name
of the family make it particularly difficult to report sexual abuse and domestic
violence (Rimonte, 1991; Tsui, 1985). Such a disclosure might separate the girl
or woman from familial support, amplifying the shame and humiliation that survivors
often feel. From philosophical or religious origins, some Asian cultures
have ascribed a positive trait to the ability to endure suffering (Ho, 1990) and
even consider suffering as one's fate (Rimonte, 1989). Thus, a woman might be
abused by male relatives, and the abuse might be accepted, either tacitly or overtly.
Rimonte (1989) further observed that immigration disrupts the role and possible
protective factor that the extended family might otherwise offer to women abused
by spouses. Even if elderly parents are part of the family system, acculturation
and disruption of traditional authority patterns might render elderly parents unable
to effectively intervene on behalf of a daughter.


Abuse is an important area of study for determining what specific aspects of
a culture, and what specific parts of patriarchal privilege, are correlated with
abuse. In one of the few studies of child maltreatment, which includes a large
number of Asian Americans, Ima and Hohm (1991) studied Southeast Asians,
Filipinos, Koreans, and Pacific Islanders who were part of the database for a San
Diego agency serving immigrants and refugees. They found that the differences
among ethnic groups in which children had been mistreated were most likely
attributable to cultural differences in life experiences, family structure, and childrearing
patterns. Samoans and Vietnamese reported high rates of child sexual
abuse, whereas it was not frequently reported in the Filipino sample. In the latter
group, the abuser often was a non-Filipino, military-enlisted stepfather. Nevertheless,
in comparing the authors' sample to general statistics for the U.S. population,
rates of physical abuse were similar and sexual abuse was either lower or
underreported in their sample.

Domestic violence is a significant unexposed problem in Asian American
communities. Rimonte (1989) reported on the presence of a shelter agency to
help Pacific Asian women and their children subjected to violence in Los Angeles
County. She emphasized diversity by group, income, and education. Of 3,000
women served by this Los Angeles center between 1978 and 1985, one third
were Korean, one third were Southeast Asian, and the rest were other Asians and
Pacific Islanders. Between 1982 and 1985, the majority of these women were
immigrant women, 90% of whom had been battered, and the remainder were
seeking services for rape. Rimonte observed several key factors that prevented
women from leaving their abusers: economic hardship, the need for sexual companionship,
and the fear of being deported. Since her initial report, immigration
laws have been changed so that a woman who has been abused in a marriage will
not be deported if she separates or divorces from her spouse.


In specifically working with Southeast Asian American refugee women, researchers
and therapists must have an informed, broad contextual framework
for understanding domestic problems that includes a consideration of the traumas
incurred before resettlement in the United States, expectations of marriage, and
relationship disequilibrators such as women being employed (Tien, 1994) before
offering formulaic approaches to domestic problems. Pre- and postmigration exposure
to violence must be considered. The life experiences of Southeast Asian
refugee women subjected to horrific war atrocities were correlated with rape and
sexual abuse, and the prevalence approached 100% (Mollica, Wyshak, &amp; Lavelle,
1987). Subsequently, many of these refugee women have a particular fear of calling
authorities; in their countries of origin, the authorities committed many of
the war atrocities (e.g., murder, pillage, rape) (Rozee &amp; van Boemel, 1989; Tien,
1994). As for postmigration, Luu (1989) observed that the economic hardships
in the United States require many Vietnamese American women to move away
from traditional roles through employment. Significant financial provision for
the family threatens the foundation on which order has been maintained. She
noted that men have had tremendous difficulty with this as they struggle in a
country where it is difficult for them to find employment. Luu suggested that
spousal abuse will be present under extreme duress and dislocation and when
gender-role changes threaten authority and the distribution of power that determines
the hierarchy; some men will attempt to assert their authority through
spousal abuse.


Song (1994) offered similar explanations for the high rate of spousal violence
she observed in her sample of 150 Korean immigrant women, 60% of whom
reported abuse by their spouses. The battering often started once they were in
the United States or intensified from its previous level. Kim (1977) and Song-Kim
(1992) spoke to the cultural factors, immigration stresses, and isolation many
Korean women experience after the immigration process that makes it difficult
to leave these relationships.


In a study of immigrant Filipinos, Agbayani-Siewert (1991) found a similar
pattern of marital role strain related to increased rates of domestic violence. She
suggested that the role strain originated in conflicts in gender-role expectations

[p. <i>224</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00235&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is important that researchers recognize and explore the diversity present
among Asian and Pacific Americans (Ho, 1990; Ima &amp; Hohm, 1991). Ho (1990)
started this process with a focus group methodology in her study of attitudes
toward physical violence in four Southeast Asian American communities in Seattle,
Washington: Khmer, Laotian, Vietnamese, and Southeast Asian Chinese.
She found that although similarities existed on the basis of patriarchal Confucianism,
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_43887');">[note]</a><div id="_note_43887" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. Confucionism, however, neither condones nor advocates violence.</div>
asserting that men are superior to women and have the authority to
dominate, there also are differences in the groups' attitudes toward violence.


Generational differences also must be considered in drawing conclusions
from all the data presented heretofore. Ho (1990) observed that breaking the
silence that keeps women and children prisoners of domestic violence is particularly
difficult for first-generation individuals because of language facility, lack of
familiarity with the system and resources, and family obligations. Leaving the
family home for safety, although a viable strategy in communities that provide
assistance and shelters, confronts the value of honor and name associated with
the family hearth (Luu, 1989), is considered an "extraordinary gesture of selfassertion"
(Rimonte, 1989, p. 332), and is perceived as selfish and at odds with
the "best interest of the collective."


Empirical data are lacking on rape statistics for Asian American women.
Again, we know that rape occurs in that it is the aftermath that can cause a woman
to seek counseling. However, rape too is an underreported crime. In an increasing
atmosphere of Asian bashing, my colleagues and I have hypothesized that rates
of physical assault against women might have increased in the form of rape.


<b>GENERAL MENTAL HEALTH</b>


Perhaps two wide assertions about the mental health of Asian Americans are that
emotional distress tends to be somatized and that Asian Americans underutilize
the mental health system. These assertions are linked through the European invention
that splits mind and body. Rozee and van Boemel (1989) stated, "Somatization
is probably a universal phenomenon with varying degrees of acceptability
in different cultures, and...an understanding of the client's cultural background
may help us to understand the significance and meaning of the symptom" (p. 36).
If someone experiences distress through physical symptoms, it is unlikely that
the individual will seek the help of a psychotherapist. In essence, psychotherapy
does not make sense as a first-line intervention for many Asian Americans (Chao,
1992; Loo &amp; Ong, 1982). Many immigrants and refugees have their own beliefs
about who and what can help them that are consistent with their personal theories
about the origins of their distress. Ying (1990) found that, even when a problem
might be conceptualized psychologically, Chinese Americans turned toward
relational strategies (e.g., family, friends, themselves) to address problems of a

[p. <i>225</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00236&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Use of mental health services also might be effected by client-therapist match.
Fujino, Okazaki, and Young (1994) analyzed Los Angeles County mental health
data from the mid-1980s. They found that ethnic and gender matches were correlated
with longer use of therapy and less severe diagnoses. This match was
found to be more important for Asian American women than for Asian American
men or White men or women.


Several studies have documented that certain psychosocial stressors particularly
present for immigrants and refugees increased their risk for continued psychological
distress and need for mental health services after they left or fled their
countries (Chao, 1992; Felsman, Leong, Johnson, &amp; Felsman, 1990; Gong-Guy,
1987; Leong &amp; Johnson, 1992; Tien, 1994). These samples are composed largely
of Chinese and Southeast Asians. Depression among women appears to be particularly
salient in some reports, whether on the West Coast (Fujino &amp; Chung,
1991; Homma-True, 1989; Ying, 1988) or the East Coast (Yu, Liu, &amp; Wong,
1987). However, if SES or birthplace and length of residence in the United States
was controlled for, then the differences between genders disappeared in a San
Francisco immigrant Chinese sample (Ying, 1988). In this same study, if SES was
controlled and education and occupation were allowed to vary, age was correlated
with depression, with younger respondents reporting more depressive symptomatology.


Homma-True (1990) noted that when some of the obstacles to psychotherapy
were removed (e.g., language barriers, scheduling conflicts, distrust) (Root,
1985), she found that approximately half of the clients using San Francisco Bay
area public mental health services were Asian American women. Like American
women in general, these women seemed to struggle with depression more frequently
than did Asian American men. She attributed these differences largely
to role strain, the stress of living biculturally and unappreciated in both cultures,
and often denying one's needs. Risk factors for depression, such as low self-esteem,
devalued social status, and poverty, are simultaneously relevant variables
describing much, but not all, of Asian America, particularly Asian American
women closer to immigrant status and old women. On the other hand, women
had lower rates of schizophrenia than did Asian American men based on service
utilization. Homma-True (1991) suggested that the spectrum of disorders that
includes psychotic symptoms might impinge more on men's ability to work in
gender-role proscriptions than on women's, which might bring them to the attention
of mental health service systems even though the range of symptoms is
approximately evenly distributed by gender (American Psychiatric Association,
1994).


Fujino and Chung (1991) obtained results similar to those of Homma-True
(1989) using Los Angeles County data. There were no gender differences for
Asian Americans for depression. This finding departs from the typical finding of

[p. <i>226</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00237&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Immigration poses many stresses to immigrant women, who might have less
support and help from extended family who are not present and might feel alienated
by customs of interaction, language, and/or knowledge of resources
(Homma-True, 1991). Gender-role strain that may follow adaptation to the need
to work to support the family might contribute to immigrants' stress levels. Furthermore,
immigrant women and men might end up taking lower-status and lower-
paying jobs because certification or credentialing procedures in the United States
differ from those in their countries of origin. This lends itself to depression, low
self-esteem, and alienation even from oneself.


<b><i>Refugee Mental Health</i></b>


Mental health concerns are particularly salient for Southeast Asian refugees,
Vietnamese, Laotian, and Khmer who have migrated involuntarily, have not necessarily
preferred to reside in the United States, and have most frequently endured
a significant number of war atrocities (Kinzie, Fredrickson, Ben, Fleck, &amp; Karls,
1984). For women, these atrocities include witness to murder of family and friends
as well as rape or the torture of their spouses, children, and other family members.
Rozee and van Boemel's (1989) study of functionally blind female Cambodian
refugees documented that 90% of the participants had lost 1 to 10 relatives; the
women had witnessed many of the deaths. Many of these women were widowed
because of the war. Tien (1994) observed that therapists should attend to dates
of departure. Vietnamese women who left before 1975 or in the first wave tended
to have money and resources; they did not go through the camp experiences.
Many of the relational resources to which young adult refugees might turn are
not available; many mothers of these now young adults are distressed and unable
to provide the psychological caregiving their children might need because of their
traumas (Leong &amp; Johnson, 1992).


Chung (1991) used data from one of the first statewide needs assessment
studies that used a nonclinical, representative sample to study the well-being of
Southeast Asian refugees in California. The differences between groups and by
gender were explained by pre- and postmigration variables. Premigration trauma
experiences were a consistent predictor of distress, as measured by depression
and anxiety. In general, men's distress, more so than women's, could be predicted
in part by postmigration issues that involved employment and income and sources
of traditional identity. Of three groups studiedâ€”Cambodians, Laotians, and Vietnamese
â€”Cambodians were the most distressed group, followed by Laotians
and Vietnamese. The women in all groups were more distressed than the men.

<b>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</b>


The consideration of specific political and cultural legacies must become the domain
of psychology if psychologists are to move away from stereotypes to understand
the psychology of Asian American women in context and in a framework
that includes notions of adaptation and positive transformation indicative of resiliency.
Contemporarily, being an Asian American woman has many complexities.
We do not currently understand all of the complexities of being located at
the intersection of gender, ethnicity, social class, generation, geographic region,
and educational achievement. Now more than ever, the Asian American woman
has many representatives. Generation, age, religion, ethnicity, geographical region,
values, and orientations to family and society guarantee diversity among
Asian American women (Bradshaw, 1994). Compared to 20 years ago, the Asian
American woman is less defined by the man with whom she is in a relationship.


We have more Asian Americans in graduate school in psychology than ever
before. Many of these students are women. This fact increases the likelihood that
more research will be conducted on Asian American women in the future. What
are some of the directions to which past research points us? What research needs
to be done? The increased size and variability of Asian America underscores the
importance of studying the differential impact that specific cultural and political
legacies exert on behavior, identity, values, and ultimately mental health. Researchers
must resist amalgamating Asian American groups across ethnicities
without a rationale beyond convenience. We need to carefully consider gender
differences in the issues studied. Research studies must anticipate the complex
braid of variables (e.g., gender, class, ethnicity, generation) that may help us to
decipher the meanings of results. We need studies to be ethnic-group specific for
rape, abuse, divorce, identity development, mental health, sexuality, and intermarriage.
Additional areas of study not reviewed in this chapter include the elderly
(particularly because women tend to outlive men); health practices that decrease
risks; contemporary child rearing; educational aspirations and attainment as they
combine with decisions about family, pregnancy, and childbearing; management
of stereotypes of Asian American women in the workplace; transgenerational
trauma, particularly for children of refugees; the reporting of rape, sexual abuse,
physical abuse, and domestic violence; the impact of welfare reform and managed
