It happened during a week when my family wasn't exactly having a
winning streak on our home court. I mean, there was a lot of tension;
so much tension that I remember hiding under my covers for
most of it. They hardly noticed. The sounds of arguing came in
through the crack under my bedroom door, even though I put a lot
of blankets and shit under it to keep the noise out. I was Davy
Crockett and I had my own little Alamo going on, man. I also had
the screwball Mets on the radio from the West Coast so New Jersey
boys hiding from their adolescence could feel better, secure in the
knowledge that as bad as childhood seemed, the '62 Mets were
worse. I loved them for that. I loved that brave, mostly ridiculous
team of aging stars and young players who seemed to be doing bad
Jerry Lewis impressions most of the time. So did the Dodger fans,
the bastards lucky enough to have my Brooklyn Dodgers playing out
of uniform as their home team. They were screaming even louder
than my family. I could hear them over the little portable radio that
I crammed up against my ear in the dead of night.


Oh, <i>that night</i>, when none of the yelling in the house made any
sense at all and I felt like I was just going to bust. Just blow up. Right
there in bed. Like a tiny float in the Jewish Macy's parade trying to
show off to the other giant floats that it had something to say too! I
could much more easily understand why the people in L.A. were
screaming than everyone downstairs. They had Sandy Koufax. We
had a history of angina.

I tried to drown out the horrifying noise downstairs by turning
up the radio on the taunting screams of the fake Dodger fans. I lay
on my bed as if I were lying in state as members of my family continued
their filibuster on happiness, unaware that I was praying for
something better for me. I don't really know who I was praying to
but I know I was praying because I had my hands clasped together
like I thought you were supposed to.


And I didn't know what exactly I was praying for but maybe it
was love because whatever kind of love I was supposed to be getting
by birthright wasn't happening. I mean, should a fourteen-year-old
kid be praying in the middle of the night like this? It sure didn't feel
right.


And then, it happened. I got this image. There was this silly little
candle in my belly. I didn't know whether to scream or laugh so I
shut up. I just lay there, quietly. The candle seemed to burn brighter
the more I thought about it. And the more I thought about the candle,
the less I heard the yelling, from both coasts.


It's easy now to guess what it meant. I think it had to do with
faith. With faith in myselfâ€”but I got the strength from an unknown
place. Maybe God. Maybe some kind of god that was my own special
God. The kind of God I groove with today.


But back then I wasn't so sure. The sense of nothingness I'd had
inside me for so long made me want to scream for understanding.
But who would hear me? Not the people downstairs. Who would
understand? I surely didn't understand.


I knew only one thing for certain. I didn't want to be like them. I
had very little idea why they seemed so unhappy but suddenly it
became very clear, frighteningly clear I had to fly solo. It was that
simple. I was getting lost, real lost, and as I reached out for help the
only thing that answered the call was this candle. There was a candle
in my belly, thank God. And I came to realize, in miraculous
fashion, while Koufax was mowing down my heroes, that if the candle
ever went out, I would probably either feel dead or BE DEAD.


When I was lying on a gurney in an ER thirty years later, in much
the same position but this time hallucinating from excess cocaine

Now I know what it means to hit bottom. Rock Bottom. And
there was a candle in my belly, thank God.


Oh, yeah. Koufax pitched a no-hitter.
