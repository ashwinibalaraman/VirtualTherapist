It blows. Even though I have given myself the chance of a lifetime to
reevaluate my past and try to make amends for whatever smashed
ruins I might have left in my drunken wake, and though I now live
each day sober and full of gratitude, life is still replete with so many
minefields of pain it sometimes feels senseless, comfortless, and even
more insane than when drinking was at the center of my existence.
Today has been, so far, an example of me living the life of an
ungrateful addict in recovery. I didn't thank my God for anything. I
didn't take any time before I started my day to count my blessings.
(Ha! "Count my blessings." What a wimpy phrase. At least it always
seemed that way to me until I became <i>and</i> admitted to being an alcoholic.
It was the kind of shit I always seemed to hear in some inane
Christmas flick or screamed about in a tent full of fearful believers by
some money-grubbing pulpit-thumper.) I didn't think about others
less fortunate. I didn't call any fellow recovering addicts like I was
advised to do, when I was feeling like shit and shaky, from day one.
Instead, I isolated and allowed myself to feel that the rest of my life
was passing me by, and that there was nothing I could do to make
myself feel better. It takes a long time to fill the empty glass with
spirituality when alcohol is out of the question.


Apparently, even sober, when I don't get what I want when I
want it, and, in particular, don't run after women the way I used to
after spotting someone that leaves me thunderstruck, I get amazingly
depressed. Women, one of my many major, co-headlining
addictions, came leaping into my life faster than a speeding pussy
once I gave up alcohol. And, apologies to the feminists, when I mean
pussy I mean pussy. Pussy to me is not the woman the potential sexual
act is attached to, but the word and how it's really a way to
demean myself. You don't make love to "pussy," you fuck pussy; and
as long as addicts fuck themselves up they will never be able to have

As far as I know, female sex addicts or women with intimacy
problems don't have any corresponding or similarly disturbing slang
for their men. It's about time they came up with some, though,
because there are just as many women who are real cockhounds as
there are pussyhoundsâ€”although a very intoxicated woman once
spent several hours in a crowded bar trying to convince me that
women were only "powerhounds" and that cocks had very little to
do with much of anything. Her companion, dressed in a tight foil
dress, with perfectly cut-out holes for her nipples to take in the
sights and sounds, chimed in occasional moans of agreement when
she wasn't caressing her smashed date's body.


Anyway. This morning started out like shit because I couldn't
help thinking obsessively about all the things I hadn't done, so I
decided to run out of my house to buy a CD, to try to let some good
music drown out my pointless thoughts. Then the "disease" struck. I
spotted a woman so beautiful and so striking that I forgot momentarily
that I was in a relationship. I was at once conflicted, the old me
competing with the new and improved sober me who was trying to
live life with more principles and dignity and not to act out every
desire. But man, it's like being in a goddamn vise. It's actually easy
now for me to go back to bars and just relax and have a few diet
sodas and have fun or write without igniting in myself any interest
in drinking, but this pussy thing is a motherfucker. If only I didn't
continue to enable myself in addictions other than drinking, life
could be a breeze; but I do, and it's torture. Acting out with a woman
while I'm involved with another woman is, for me, almost like taking
a drink again.


One day when I'm ready to allow myself the luxury of being
happy and content, maybe I'll treat these urges the way I treat alcohol
and just not <i>go there</i>. But on this particular morning I wasn't
quite so evolved. So I followed this mysterious, amazing creature
into a hip coffee bar to get a closer look, hoping that she might be

No such luck. It's never easy. It wasn't easy giving up booze and it
isn't easy to stop fucking around. (Liquor stores and beautiful
women are everywhere. And to me this woman fell into another
category altogether. She was killer. She was Queen Rush.)


In fact, I realized that she was even more beautiful than I'd
thought, as I tried to order my coffee and snatch a look at her at the
same time, with about as much finesse as a python gobbling up his
nearest snack. I was again powerless over an unknown woman who
I knew I shouldn't be messing with. This addiction had me by my
balls again.


We were standing right next to each other, and it was now or
never. Years ago, particularly if I were high, this would have been a
piece of cake. But now, sober and loving another woman, I felt both
strangely mature about recognizing how wrong it was to even think
I would pick up this stranger, and also impotent, because at "penis
control" all systems were "Go." It's hard, trying to have principles
when your cock is hard. I was a wreck. If I'd ever been cool in front
of strange women before it certainly wasn't showing. I was the polar
opposite of the kind of cool Marcello Mastroianni always seemed to
exude. I was the new me. As embarrassed as I felt, at least I was
being myself. And as strange as it seems to say, given the circumstances,
I know that's a good thing.


I had made up my mind that there was no way I was going to try
to meet this woman. I ordered something robotically, then listened
as she ordered in a voice with more sexuality and heat than I could
stand to be around. I tried to find a way out of the place to save my
nervous masculinity, which was rapidly slipping away.


She was dressed beautifully and was very tall with enormous
breasts. Having an overpowering need to at least say something, but
also making a valiant effort to preserve my monogamy, I chose simply
to tease her by pointlessly commenting to her that the pattern on
her shoes was intimidating to me and probably to other men as well
and asked her how she could walk around like that and expect to

Painfully slowly, I strangely started to feel good about myself,
even though every addicted fiber in my body was fighting it every
inch of the way. Taking on good habits is a bitch.
