 Dr. August Johannson is my psychiatrist while I am at the EDC.
When we are not in his presence, we call him the Johannsonator,
or Augie. He is a quiet and thoughtful man, an ex-lacrosse player
for the University of Wisconsin, who walks with a swagger and has
a shy Midwestern smile. Several residents have intense crushes on
him. Whenever his back is turned, Courtney does hip thrusts and
makes an orgasm face behind his back, which sends us into gales of
giggles. The consensus on the floor is that most everyone would fuck
the Johannsonator if given the chance (I, however, would not). I tend
to think this sexual fascination with him comes from the power he
holds over us. He decides if we get solo walks (the privilege of walking

During my time at the EDC, I am not on any psychiatric
meds, although I spend many of my Johannsonator sessions begging
for Ativan or Xanax because I'm having massive anxiety attacks that
leave me curled in a ball on the sofa, feeling like I'm dying of that
heart attack I used to wish for. The Johannsonator thinks I need
to experience my feelings instead of numbing them out with eating
disorder behavior or medication; therefore, he will not prescribe me
anything but Prozac, which I refuse to take because of a horrible
experience I had with Paxil when I was seventeen. (I had withdrawal
when I stopped taking it, even though I tapered the dosage
as my doctor directed me to.)


Because we don't have much to talk about in the way of
medication, the Johannsonator and I talk about my body image (it's
usually atrocious). He asks me about my body image and I start
crying, and he says, "I'm guessing this means it's not too good." Then
we argue about whether my weight is stable (I say no, he says yes),
and then we are done until the next week, when we have the same
conversation again.


However, sometimes we also talk about my parents, and how
they think everything I do is meant to get their attention or to rebel
against them. For example, I pierced my nose and they thought it
was a direct attack on their values. I pierced my nose because I find
nose rings aesthetically pleasing. My parents sometimes forget that

The Johannsonator and I discuss what my main issues are, and
we agree that I struggle with perfectionism academically and in relation
to my body. I internalize my emotions and put up a strong front
until I explode in a ball of rage or eating disorder behavior. (My
symptoms tend to follow a cycle: It worsens during the school year
and it starts as restricting myself.) When Rachel, the psychodrama
counselor, questions the degree to which I drank during college, the
Johannsonator understands when I tell him I am not an alcoholic,
although I admit to having abused alcohol in college, like so many
other college students.


In an atmosphere that can be best described as chaotic, my
weekly Johannsonator sessions keep me grounded. They are part of
how I learn to trust people again, and to open up.
