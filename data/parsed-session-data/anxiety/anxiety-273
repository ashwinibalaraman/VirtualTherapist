The actions were intertwined—my return to religion
and the beginning of a book.


I can pinpoint the moment when I ceased to think of suicide.
I can also pinpoint that moment when I could first sense the
lifting of my mood from depression toward elation. It began
with the decision to write a book....


In the apartment by myself, with Marilyn at work, the thought
came to me that if I could do nothing else worth while, at least
I could write about what had happened to me....


The writing went smoothly from the start. I was surprised to
find myself writing with such facility and ease. My self-confidence
surged as, it seemed to me, for the first time in my life
I was able to say just exactly what I wanted to say. I showed
the writing to my wife, my friends, my pastor, others. They all
praised the work and my confidence increased still further.
They told me there were some things that would have to be
changed—like the prayers I placed on paper before I got into
the actual narration. But the story itself was very good, they
told me. Fascinating, they told me....


As I worked and as the work was praised, my confidence
mounted to heights of elation.


A dam inside me had broken....


...<i>Strange the pulsing silence in the apartment. The bright,
hot rays of this summer sun flood your study and touch your
books, your desk and your typewriter with a glowing life and
beauty. Thank God that you can speak now and so swiftly write</i>

... Now, in a rush, I saw the book in its entirety. If only I
could write a million words at once, it would be finished in a
moment. The title: <i>Flight</i>. In Volume I, countless flashings
back into my life that I might show those things I did which
brought me to the wall. That I might show the things all men do
unaware which bring them all unto a wall. Volume I: the tragic
flight from God, the flight toward illness, the flight toward
death.... And in Volume II, the flight to God, the flight to
health, the flight to life.... In Volume I, I'd write of that
which is seeming real but is not. I'd write of the apparent triumph
of evil over good, of things ugly, false, unreal. And in
Volume II, I'd bring the truth to light. With the help of God,
I'd show the victory, in all its beauty, of that which is real over
that which is seeming real....


At the top of the page I wrote swiftly out of the beginnings
of a mounting madness a prayer for inspiration. I wrote unknowingly,
in an almost perfect, unconscious imitation of the
manner of Saint Augustine.


The words flew out: "God, help me to write this, for I do not
want to. For I want to write of You alone, God, and how You
finally let me feel Your Love for me, Your creature. But, so
that I can write of Your Mercy, first I must tell how I fled all
things, and how, though I fled in panic from You, though I
locked You out of my heart, though I did not even admit Your
Existence, still You were with me, and though I was like a wild
and frantic bird in my aimless flight, still You gave me the
grace to fly to You and to know You....


... "God, I love You and adore You. Thank You, God, for
giving me life and even when I turned from You, You were
with me and did not leave me completely.... And you who
read this: Judge me not by what I write. I do not write that you

After the manner of the <i>Confessions of Saint Augustine</i>, in
unconscious imitation, I began my own confession.


My mind raced. My fingers flew. I told about my first realizations
of my illness, about the day Marilyn lost the baby, about
my admission into the hospital. In flashbacks I wrote of certain
happenings of my past life in which I thought the causes of my
illness were symbolized. In my mind the book was full-shaped.
In a fever I hurried toward its conclusion, my inspiration fed to
flames by the sweet praise of those about me.


Page after page flew like live things just born out of my typewriter.
I worked six, eight, ten, twelve, and finally fourteen
and sixteen hours a day at the writing. Without ever a pause for
correction, with no sense of strain, in an ecstasy, I wrote. In
June, July and August I wrote several hundreds of thousands of
words and yet I was not near the end of the story!


Inside me a dam had broken indeed. Now I talked, as I
wrote, with a swift fluency. My style of speech had become the
same as my style of writing. Marilyn remarked on it. "You
don't talk like yourself any more. You talk to me as if we were
both characters in your book. You don't sound like your old
self."


"I hope I never do again," I said.


Marilyn knew that there was something wrong with me, but
she didn't know just how sick I was. Nor I think, at that time,
did anyone else—except Dr. Andrews. By early September I
was a source of puzzlement, of anxious wonder, of concern to
Marilyn and my friends, but they didn't know for sure just how
sick I was. And there were others who thought I was not sick at
all. As far as I know, early in September, only Dr. Andrews
was aware that I was not sane.


He knew, the last time I saw him....


"Dr. Andrews, you know I've been working on a book. I

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I think I would."


"You could help me. In the story I have trouble writing of
you."


"How's that?"


"It's that I don't know how to make you human."


"Is it your task, you think—to make me human?"


<i>What a wonder to talk to him now so free of fear! Strange,
you've never noticed his true size. He seems so small and thin.
You'd thought him larger than he truly is</i>....


"I'd hoped to do that, to make you human, in my book, but
you will have to help me. I must tell you. I've had this thought
that you might be a ghoul—your life and health sustained
through your feedings upon the sick souls of patients such as I.
You are so cold. And yet so interested in me. Do not be offended,
Doctor, but reassure me. Tell me you are human and
not a ghoul."


From Dr. Andrews came only a grim, cold silence and a
steady stare into my eyes....


"Doctor, your silence screams the truth! You refuse to admit
you are human! You <i>are</i> a ghoul! Dr. Andrews, I'm leaving
you now. I'm walking from you in a run! And I pray God's
mercy, I'll never see you again."


From Dr. Andrews came only silence and a strange, slight
curling of the lips. Was it a sneer he sent my way from his cold
distance, or a poor twisted smile of sorrowing pity? ...


"Bob, Dr. Andrews called me today. He gave me such a
chill. He insisted you are very sick and should be sent to a hospital
right away."


"What did you say to him?"


"I told him I wouldn't have you sent any place you didn't
want to be. I told him I'd take care of you for now. What did
you say to stir him up so?"


"I questioned his humanity. I asked him if he were man or
ghoul."

"Bob, oh, no!"


"You know how grave he is. I asked him from what grave
he sprang."


"Bob, you can't talk to people like that."


"I'm sorry now I did...."


After my break with Dr. Andrews I chose a new medical
advisor, an allergist with some psychiatric training. Dr. Scott
did not feel I was as ill as Dr. Andrews believed. Dr. Scott was
one of those certain people, strangers, who, not knowing me before
my illness, could not, it seemed, know how greatly I had
changed. As long as I talked to such people on everyday affairs
and not overmuch on matters of philosophy or religion, they
seemed unaware I was not myself.


In mid-September I was offered a job as editor of a small but
prosperous weekly newspaper on the outskirts of town. The
publisher wanted me to come to work at once. He was desperate
for help. The pay he offered was small, but the work was a
thing I'd always wanted to do. Now the question was: Should
I take the job and work part-time on the book with the risk that
the demands of the job might end in drawing me away from the
book entirely? Or should I turn down the job and finish the
book while I was in this strange, fluent fever which made its
swift writing seem such a thing of ease?


I <i>had</i> to know just how good this thing I was writing was—
and from an unbiased critic, not my wife or friends. I called on
a professor of creative writing at the state university.


I explained my problem to Professor Leeson. I told him
about the writing and why I wanted his criticism. Then, leafing
through the bundle of manuscript, I withdrew what I thought
was one of the better sections, thrust the pages toward him....


"Here, Professor Leeson, take a look. You see, what I'm
trying to do in this passage is to symbolize the false values of
life which make men sick...."


Professor Leeson read very fast. Then he laid the pages down,
looked up at me. "This is very good. There's a sweep and a
flow to this. I'd like to read some more."

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

How was it he didn't see my madness in the writing? If only
he had known me before my change of personality, then, perhaps
he wouldn't have been so quick to say: "Mr. Dahl, perhaps
I can help you find a publisher for this. Have you anyone in
mind?"


"No, not for sure. I'd thought I'd like a Catholic publisher."


He considered and then shook his head. "No, I think this is
of general interest. Why don't we aim at one of the big ones?
I have a friend at a New York house. I'd be glad to talk to him
about your book, and you'd find his firm sympathetic to your
religious convictions, I'm sure."


"Well, all right. That would be very kind of you. You know
my problem. The work is far from complete, but I have to make
a choice at once—as I told you—whether or not to take this
newspaper job or keep on the book full-time."


"Let me write Bill Hawkins. He can put you in touch with
the right people."


"Will you phone him?"


"Why, I'd be glad to."


Professor Leeson did. I could see Mr. Hawkins Monday
morning in New York if I wished. The appointment was set.
Over Marilyn's protests but with, at last, her fearful consent, I
went to New York City.


I was there four days. Just eight months before, when I'd
been there last, I had found its people, in my depression, cold
and distant. This time the opposite was true. I embraced the
city and its people in a wild happiness, in elation, in exaltation.


I suppose some of those people to whom I talked charged it
up to a writer's eccentricity, the strangeness they found in me.
For I didn't hesitate at all to tell them I was a writer, a writer
with a most unusual and wonderful philosophy of life out of
which I'd written a book. I didn't hesitate to let them know that
a publisher was interested in that book. And it was true!


The editor who was reading the book told me plainly he was
interested in it. But it was not their policy to give an immediate
answer, and he couldn't give me an advance. If I would just go

During this time, as precious thoughts poured into and around
my feverish brain, I would scribble little notes for my use later
in the multitude of books I planned to write. My notes also
included all the important actions I felt I should take immediately.
There were so many important actions I felt I should
take at once, I could not keep them all in mind unless I put them
down on paper. In my hotel room in New York I wrote out for
future reference such notes as the following. With what great
and hidden meanings did my own words hold me as I spun them
out by pencil and typewriter:


"... Call Monsignor Sheen Tuesday. Ask him if you can
appear for just a minute on his television show. Good publicity
for the book. Also, your thoughts are his thoughts!"


"When see Monsignor Sheen, point out ‘miracle’ possibilities
... certain aspects of recovery.... Ask him to convert Dorothy
Parker!" (I never did see Monsignor Sheen. He was out of
town.)


"... In Volume II, couldn't there be a trial of my sanity? ...
As in a dream ..."


"...The Devil is awful. The Angel is full of awe.... In
surrendering self gain self! I helped crucify God and He saw
me! Not in the horizontal space of the present multitude but in
vertical time He saw me two thousand years later.... <i>Get in
the fairy story of all love: the princess who loves the ugly dwarf
and the cruel one who shows the dwarf his image in the mirror</i>,
etc.... When appropriate, perhaps I can be advisor to the

I stayed in New York until I'd spent the money Marilyn had
given me and had to wire for more. Finally I flew home, high
in the air, far above all clouds, far above the earth and its poor
people. Into what great distance I could see! Past the curvature
of the earth itself I could see! In my mind a great plan began
to stir to life and against its promise the book itself seemed a
trivial project indeed!
