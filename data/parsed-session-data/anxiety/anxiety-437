ANXIETY is the bubonic plague of the twentieth century.
Immaturity is its breeding ground, insecurity its
symptom. These all play a major role in the development
of an alcoholic. Anxiety begins with fear--fear
of the unknown, fear of oneself, fear of people, fear of
not measuring up, fear of living. Anxiety is fear
squashed down inside of you, gnawing at your insides,
your organs, your loves, your emotions, screaming to
get out. If anxiety becomes powerful enough, overwhelming
enough, and it often does, the person whom
it possesses may become suicidal. Life does not hold
enough joy, enough adventure for you to overcome that
all-pervading sense of hopelessness and fear. Living,
life itself, cannot beat out anxiety.


In many ways we each dig our own grave. Probably
alcoholism and addiction to pills are forms of the death
wish. Logically taken, if you accept the premise that an

Yet, in reality, alcohol only prolongs the agony, only
increases the anxiety, only makes everything a whole
lot worse. When you are an alcoholic your guilt increases
a thousandfold. You become the prey of every
accusation, the butt of every sordid joke, the mistake in
everyone's environment. Alcohol doesn't deaden anxiety;
it only channels it. Through alcohol, you become
anxiety's child.


Where does this anxiety come from? What brings a
"normal" American girl with every advantage, a
healthy, pretty, well-educated female to the brink of
alcoholic destruction? And, surprisingly enough, many
alcoholic women I know <i>are</i> quite beautiful. Lovely
enough, poised enough, educated enough to be the envy
of many of their friends. What happened? Many personalities
fit into the alcoholic pattern. But there are
some who have a greater tendency to become alcoholic
than others. The main reason is emotional immaturity.
Some girls are mature at fifteen; some women are
children at sixty.


What is maturity? The dictionary defines maturity as
completeness of growth and development, fully worked
out, perfected. I define it as an acceptance of who you

Mothers play an enormous role in the maturation of
their children. It is no accident that the baby bottle full
of milk often turns into the bottle full of scotch or
Seconal. Here are some self-explanatory questions relating
to maturity:
<blockquote>
<p>
Are you afraid to leave your mother's house?
</p>
<p>
Do you depend on your family for strength, aid,
and encouragement?
</p>
<p>
Do you defy your mother, telling yourself "you'll
show her," but secretly glad she's there to
discipline you?
</p>
<p>
If you're over eighteen, do you turn down dates to
stay home with mother?
</p>
<p>
Do you feel you would be deserting her, if you
were to marry?
</p>
<p>
If you are married, do you call her every day or
fly to her with every problem?
</p>
<p>
Or, on the other side of the coin, are you willing
to, or have you, married in haste--perhaps the
first boy who came along--to "show" your
family?
</p>
<p>
Is your heart bound up in old and aging relationships,
safe ones, which demand little or nothing
of you?
</p>
<p>
Are you unwilling, even vaguely so, to meet new
friends, try something new, give of yourself a
little?
</p>
<p>
Are the relationships in which you are most at ease
those you made in school?
</p>
<p>
Are you afraid to take your place in society, to

fight for your rights and the respect due you
from others?

Do you isolate yourself, physically, or emotionally,
to avoid being hurt?


Do you react badly to responsibility?


Do you expect other people to undo your mistakes,
if you say you're sorry?


If so, you are immature. You are in conflict with
yourself. And, if you choose to drink, you may already
be racing down the road to alcoholic dependence!


While the anxious and immature are often subject
to alcoholism, so, in many instances, is the girl in pain.
This does not mean physical pain which, of course, can
also happen and can open the door to barbiturate addiction.
It means psychic pain. Pain so deep you often
cannot acknowledge its existence. You know something
terrible is happening to you; it hurts. So you drink to
blot it out. By drinking, you may instinctively be putting
off something worse: a nervous breakdown, an ulcer,
a heart attack. Liquor is an anesthetic; it may be yours.


In some cases the psychic pain you are endeavoring
to ease may not be traumatic. It may not be a death, or
a broken marriage, or failure to get into college. It may
be something as simple as trying to get over your nervousness
at a dance, or giving a dinner for your husband's
boss, or playing in the tennis tournament. You're
nervous; you drink for "courage." It works the first
time. You've learned the remedy; you increase your
intake for future problems. Soon you are on the merry-
go-round. It's very easy to climb aboard.


Third in the alcohol-susceptible group is the girl
who hates herself. She may have had a very strict,
proper upbringing. She may constantly castigate herself

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000881439-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Fourth is the spoiled-rotten girl. These are multiplying
in America today. Mommy coddled her all her life;
daddy denied her nothing. She was never frustrated in
any really important way. But one day she is--by an
outside force. A prettier, smarter girl appears in school.
There is someone more competent where she works. Or
her husband cannot give her the Rolls until next week.
She will <i>not</i> be thwarted, so she drinks. Drinking blots
out her frustrations--and besides she likes it. If her
behavior can make those who love her squirm, so much
the better. They deserve it, she feels. When this woman
sobers up, she will probably find it very difficult indeed
to become honest with herself.


Fifth are women whose basic immaturity and consequent
hostility take sexual forms. They may be afraid
of men; they may be nymphomaniacs; they may be
lesbians. Strangely enough, in the alcoholic pattern these
women are very much in the minority. Some of them
dissipate their aggressive drives in jobs. How many
women do you know who have to prove every day they
are as good as, or better than, men? If they are married,
some take it out on defenseless, ineffectual husbands or
unsuspecting children. Or they may form alliances with
other women. If they add alcohol to their other problems,

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000881439-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The women described here are merely a few of the
neurotic personalities prone to alcoholism, all of which
may overlap. There are many other kinds of alcoholic
problems. If you do not find your personality structure
here, and you are having trouble with your drinking --
or you are taking too many pills--do not lie to yourself.
It is the very nature of your disease that you do so. If
you put this section down with relief, telling yourself,
"That's not me," you still may be very ill.


Some women just slip into alcoholism. They are attractive
and ambitious. Often they are very capable. When
their assets are not readily recognized, they may begin
to drink. They may be frustrated and unhappy. They become
disillusioned. They discover with a shock that in
the big world, ethics is often a meaningless word. Morality
is something they heard their mothers mention. Nice
guys finish last. All that matters is money and success.
If they meet any interesting men, they do not wish to
marry. They are in "The Great Wasteland." Their
rainbow-colored world turns to an ugly gray. They
drink to color it "beautiful" again. They take pills to
make it livable. They are addicted.


Other women succumb to pressures and tensions.
Twentieth-century pressures are unceasing. Face it, they

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000881439-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To hold a job, you may have to become a cheat, a
liar, a phony, a plagiarist. To get into the "right" clubs,
or to get your children into the "right" schools, you become
a panderer, a toady, an entertainer of viragos, a
snob. You may have to turn your back on family, background,
religion, and decency. Cheating in school is not
only accepted, it seems, it is often expected! The questions
you go to sleep with are: "What have they done
for me today?" and "Am I with it?" Only the truly mature
and secure know they don't have to prove anything.


Is it any wonder some women can't cope? Some try to
flee physically, into marriages, for example, both bad
and good. Or into jobs abroad. And some flee psychically
-- into liquor, tranquilizers, barbiturates, sex, into sanitaria
and suicide. Alcohol becomes promise and fulfillment.
Alcohol becomes religion, when faith is dead.
It is the substitute for the man you dreamed you would
marry. It is the companion for your lonely hours, a substitute
for love, a buffer against nagging in-laws. Alcohol
is humor and joy and friendship. It is the answer to
everything. But how can you live with it?


Sheila was the only daughter of a strict Irish Catholic
household. She was adored by her mother, and to a certain
degree by her father. Her mother gave her everything
-- beautiful clothes, a summer home, cars, dancing
lessons, piano lessons, riding lessons, in short, everything
that makes up the American Dream. She was well-
educated in a series of small, exclusive convent schools.
She graduated from college <i>magna cum laude</i> and went
to graduate school. She was pretty and very popular.


However, unlike many spoiled girls, Shelia was ambitious

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000881439-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the surface her family was a normal, well-to-do
functioning household. But underneath it was chaotic.
Sheila's father drank, pretty much all of the time. Her
mother compensated by taking over and running the
family. Shelia was repeatedly warned not to marry a
drinker but to marry a man who could give her the finer
things in life. When she graduated from college she
became engaged to a solid, upstanding Irish boy. His
idea of life was a house in the suburbs and seven children;
hers was trips to Europe, mink coats, and gracious
entertaining. She was wise enough to see it wouldn't
work and broke the engagement. She was ready for a
flaming career.


She went into the communications business. Drinking
is part of that industry's way of life. However, Sheila
did not realize that most performers and executives do
not drink to excess. They simply cannot afford to. It was
a glamorous, gay life. She met many celebrities and
drank with all of them. She also drank with anyone else
who asked her to. She thought it was smart and fun.
Alcohol was not a problem to her then, but later she told
me she wondered what kind of a job she might have
done had she been fully sober all the time. As it was,
she performed adequately and was offered a better job
by a network. She was twenty-three and thought she was
on top of the world. She began to drink more. She never
had lunch without a drink. She always went somewhere
for cocktails after work. She began to be lonely. Her
friends were all getting married; she was living at home

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000881439-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sheila had two more engagements. One to a totally
unsuitable delegate to the U.N., one to a very attractive
emotional and financial leech. She was drinking all the
time now, not caring very much what happened to her.
She looked terrible, had gained a great deal of weight
and cut her hair, and became quite careless about her
appearance. Her world had turned gray; she could not
cope with her problems, many of them self-made. She
had demanded a great deal of herself; she could not
measure up any more.


One day she created a ghastly scene at the network,
secretly hoping to be fired. She was. But before she left,
a man she had met there asked her to go to an Alcoholics
Anonymous meeting with him. He knew she had a drinking
problem, that most of her other problems stemmed
from that. She agreed to go.


She was fascinated by the people she met at this particular
meeting. They were very kind, rather witty, and
certainly to Sheila's very confused mind, well brought
up and upper class. She thought A.A. was marvelous
--but not for her. She could not accept the fact that
she was an alcoholic. She had never been to a doctor,
had never been in any real trouble, had had no car accidents,
nor lost anything really worth while. She was,
however, a completely different personality than she had
been. She was confused, bored, cynical, unfeeling, irresponsible,
and terribly afraid of life and the future.


She continued to drink, but she also began to wonder
about it. A.A. had at least done that much for her. Her

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000881439-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She found out later in A.A. that she had reached
her "bottom." She also discovered that the days of the
Bowery alcoholics are over, that you reach your bottom
when you can no longer live with yourself. You then
have two choices open to you: You can either get sober
or you can become a complete vegetable, end up in an
institution, and die.


Sheila found it extremely difficult to admit to herself
or to anyone else that she could be an alcoholic. The
word was, in her mind, bound up irrevocably with a lack
of morality and a lack of will power. She slowly discovered
that she had a disease, a killing disease at that.
She learned that once she took the first drink she could
not stop. That it was the first drink that got her drunk.
She learned that the only way to arrest her disease was
to stop drinking altogether. She learned to do this, painfully
and nervously, one day at a time. At first, she
said, it was one hour at a time, then it expanded. Anyone
can stay away from a drink for one hour, and eventually
that becomes habitual. Sobriety, like alcoholism,
is progressive.


Sheila was very lucky; she had never heard of pills.
Drinking was sociability and gregariousness to her; taking
pills was solitary and defeatist. With the help of

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000881439-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If you have any kind of a liquor or pill problem,
don't doubt. Don't wait. Don't lie to yourself. Get busy
--now. As Sheila said to me, "Tomorrow may be too
late."
