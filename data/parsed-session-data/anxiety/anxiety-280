CRAIG


Craig was a 19-year-old student who had dropped out
of his first year of college at the beginning of the second
semester because of depression and progressive inability
to concentrate on his courses. Upon leaving school he
began outpatient psychiatric treatment and was placed
on antidepressant medication (tricyclic compound).
Some three weeks later he began to be increasingly restless
and anxious, and to suffer from progressive insomnia.
These symptoms gave way to feelings of having
"waked up" and "become alive," ideas that rapidly assumed
an exaggerated and delusional quality. He was
hospitalized and the working diagnosis was acute schizophrenia.
Craig's life had suffered its first significant blow
when he was only 11 years old. At this time his mother,
with whom he had a particularly close—if not exclusive
—relationship, died as a result of malignant melanoma.
The boy then went to live with his maternal
grandmother until his father remarried two years later.

Following his admission to the hospital, Craig was
treated with antipsychotic drugs which rapidly diminished
his anxiety and brought his referential ideas under
control. During this early aftermath, approximately
three weeks after admission, he wrote the following unsolicited
account in the stream-of-consciousness style
which has been preserved here. In addition, his periodic
use of capital letters for emphasis has been retained.
Names have been altered to protect the anonymity of the
patient and his family. Tragically, this patient committed
suicide while on pass before he had been discharged
from the hospital.

<i>Part Two: Clearing Things Up</i>


The lovely robin is the harbinger of spring. After
you wake up there are many dawning decisions to
be made—and later too. Dawn is but a rising star,
dusk is but a falling star. He walked over to see her,
but she snubbed him and he cried about it later and
he died later also. I am but a shooting star or a
comet or a body revolving around the earth which
in turn also revolves around the sun and I am
happy. Are you? Delusions frighten every one, including
you—and me. Am I sick? Do I look it or
deserve to be? Do you think so? Well, I don't. Not
really. "If most people were to be born twice they'd
probably call it dying"—e.e. cummings.
I write whatever thoughts emerge from the crossroads
of my mind, brain. Kicks are just getting
harder to find. I remember her eyes: soft, dark, and

<i>Part Three: Recovery</i>


I saw a shadow touch a shadow's hand. Nobody
said life is fair. There is a time for everything (living,
dying), the right time is harder to find. How
can you break a marshmallow? Void, a void (avoid
voids)...the sin of love's false security. Go away
from my window, leave at your own chosen speed. I
am not the one you want, I am not the one you
need, it ain't me you're looking for, babe. The hypnotic
— splattered mist was lifting (slowly). Ben
Franklin's "Bold and Arduous Plan for Arriving at
Moral Perfection"...Walden is great, really,
Thoreau must be respected for his individuality.
Thoreau must also be admired for his simplicity at
Walden Pond. My writing is getting phony, I refuse
to continue under false circumstances. My mind
(like a blanket) holds no ideas or convictions. Give
me a chance...The only truth I know is you, If I
had never loved I never would have cried. In the

<i>Comment</i>


This account, covering a period of several days, was
written by a young man soon after admission to the hospital
with an acute psychotic reaction. At the outset, we
should mention several points regarding the authenticity
of the account. This young man obviously felt that
setting his thoughts down on paper made sense for him.
He enjoyed literary subjects in general and writing in
particular, and may have even hoped that someday writing
would be part of his vocation. We would hypothesize,
however, that his experience is not unique, but rather,
in its formal aspects, rather characteristic of the early
period following hospitalization for many psychotic
patients. His verbal ability may have made it possible for
him to communicate—however imperfectly—an extremely
complex experiential state which other patients

The timing of this psychotic episode is similar to that
of the first record presented (David). The end of a heterosexual
relationship apparently was a triggering event in
Craig's life, occurring within a life experience already
sensitized to abandonment by the untimely death of both
mother and grandmother. Another ingredient was probably
important in determining the timing of this episode,
however. Antidepressant drug administration appears
to have been temporally related to the onset of this
psychotic event. Certain types of drugs appear capable of
initiating a psychotic state in certain individuals, resulting
in a weakening of defensive mechanisms which may
have previously contained specific intrapsychic conflicts.


Apparently, the form of this young man's inner experience
was extremely complex during the period
covered by this account. He was simultaneously being
assailed by a host of sensations and ideas. ("There are
tracks across and all over my brain, the tracks of lost
memories and fleeting, transient, eroding, disappearing,
lost, undiscovered, uncovered memories.") Thus, his altered
consciousness is characterized in part by a sense of
hypermnesis, the experience that memories, long forgotten,

With regard to content, the sudden, shattering loss of
maternal anchoring and support which Craig had experienced
at his mother's untimely death had somehow

In summary, this individual's inner experience is
characterized by competing simultaneous themes of (1)
anger, fear and nostalgia at being abandoned by maternal
figures while being abruptly thrust into early adulthood;
(2) desire for psychological growth, yet fear of
adult male identification in the person of his father; (3)
intense impatience and self-criticism and the pervading
sense that resolution between these conflicting motives is
both urgent and impossible. It is not difficult, given this
form of inner experience, to account for certain consequences
such as hopeless immobilization, despair, or
suicide. From the point of view of treatment, awareness
of this inner state can provide a beginning framework
for the establishment of a therapeutic relationship. A
therapist must, first of all, acknowledge and stress the
authenticity of the patient's dilemma. He must show the
patient that he is aware of the difficulty involved in abandoning
