<font size="4"><b>Chapter 11: Career Development and Vocational Behaviors</b></font>

As Leong (1985; see also Leong &amp; Serafica, 1995) has observed
repeatedly, very little research has been done on Asian Americans'
career choices and development. This deficit exists in spite of the great need for
career counseling services expressed by Asian Americans. For example, 34% of
the Asian American students taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) in 1980
expressed an intention to seek vocational-career counseling when enrolled in
college compared to 27% of Whites, 24% of Blacks, and 30% of Mexican Americans
(College Entrance Examination Board, 1980). In a more recent national
survey conducted by the Gallup organization for the National Career Development
Association (Brown, Minor, &amp; Jepsen, 1991), it was found that large percentages
of Asians and Pacific Islanders (APIs) (71%) and Hispanics (75%) reported
being interested in getting more information about careers if they could start
over. APIs (37%) also were significantly more likely to report using college career
information centers than were Whites (21%), African Americans (19%), and Hispanics
(15%). Whites (71%) were significantly more likely than APIs (61%) to
report that the information they needed was available. When they found career
information, 83% of APIs found the information useful compared to 88% of
African Americans, 77% of Whites, and 83% of Hispanics.


In addition to their interest and need for career services, Asian Americans
also constitute the fastest growing minority group in the United States. The combination
of these factors highlights the immense disparity between what is needed
and what is available by way of career theory and research on Asian Americans.
Career counselors need information on how Asian American clients may be different

This chapter is divided into three sections. The first section, consisting of an
individual level of analysis, explores Asian Americans' career interests, career
choices, occupational values, and vocational behaviors in the professions and in
organizations. It also examines personality variables that affect Asian Americans'
career development. The second section, using a group and societal level of analysis,
examines the role of macrolevel processes such as occupational stereotypes,
discrimination, occupational mobility, and occupational segregation and their potential
impact on the career development of Asian Americans. The third section
discusses the problems inherent in current research and ends with an outline of
the directions for future research.


<b>INDIVIDUAL LEVEL OF ANALYSIS</b>


<b><i>Career Interests</i></b>


Over the past 20 years, there has been only a handful of studies of the career
interest patterns of Asian Americans (Leong &amp; Leung, 1994; Leong &amp; Serafica,
1995). In a mid-1980s review of the literature on the career development of
Asian Americans, Leong (1985) was able to identify only three published emperical
articles and one dissertation related to the career interests of Asian Americans.
In the first study, which focused on Chinese Americans and was done at the
University of California, Berkeley, consisting of the School and College Ability
Test (SCAT), the Strong Vocational Interest Blank (SVIB), and the Omnibus Personality
Inventory (OPI), Sue and Kirk (1972) found that Chinese American students
had higher quantitative and lower verbal scores than did the control group.
Males in both groups did better than females in quantitative scores. Students at
Berkeley generally do better than the national norm.


Chinese American males showed more of an interest in physical sciences,
skilled technical trades, and business occupations than did all other males. They
tended to be less interested in social service and welfare, sales and business contact,
and verbal-linguistic occupations. The Chinese American males' vocational interests
appeared more masculine than those of all other males. Also, Chinese
American males seemed to aspire to a lower level of occupational status and responsibility.


Generally, Chinese American females tended to be more oriented toward the
domestic occupations. Besides this, Chinese American females exhibited more
interest in technical-applied fields, biological and physical sciences, and business

[p. <i>361</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00372&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Chinese American students were less oriented toward theoretical or abstract
ideas and concepts and tended more to evaluate ideas on the basis of their immediate
practical applications than did all other students. Chinese American
males did not differ from all other males in interest in scientific activities employing
logical, analytical, and critical thinking. Chinese American females, however,
scored much lower in that area.


In the second study, which focused on both Chinese and Japanese Americans,
Sue and Kirk (1973) found a similar pattern of vocational choices between the
two groups of Asian men. The exception was that the Japanese American men
did not express greater interest in physical sciences or lower interest in the social
sciences than did White men. In addition, Japanese American women did not
express greater interest in domestic fields than did White women. The authors
explained these differences between the Chinese and Japanese participants in
terms of differential rates of acculturation and assimilation into American society
between these two groups.


In the third study, using a typological analysis of the same Chinese and Japanese
American men who participated in the study already discussed, Sue and
Frank (1973) found that these students clustered into groups with characteristics
quite different from those of Whites. They confirmed the findings of the other
two studies and concluded that those occupations that require "forceful selfexpression,
interaction with people, and communication in oral or written form"
are the ones that Asian Americans feel most uncomfortable with and are most
likely to avoid, given their preferences for "structured, logical, concrete, and
impersonal" work activities (p. 141).


In an unpublished dissertation on career development of Asian Americans,
Kwak (1980) examined the vocational interests of Asian American youths using
Holland's (1977) Self-Directed Search. He found that the Asian American students
revealed vocational types predominantly in the investigative (25.8%) and
social (25.0%) categories.


In another unpublished study, Leong (1982) used the Vocational Preference
Inventory to assess interest patterns within Holland's model and found that Asian
American students at the University of Maryland had measured interest patterns
that were predominantly in the investigative (30%) and social (21%) areas. These
results are quite consistent with Kwak's (1980) earlier study. Interestingly, when
Leong (1982) examined the Asian American students' expressed interests (i.e.,
what career fields they said they were interested in pursuing) as opposed to their
measured interests (i.e., what the inventory said they were interested in pursuing),
a different picture emerged. More than 50% of the Asian American students
reported interests in investigative careers (vs. 30% who had measured interests),
and only 7% expressed interests in social careers (vs. 21% who had measured
interests). This discrepancy between measured and expressed interests among
Asian American students seems to be a significant clinical phenomenon worthy
of further investigation.

[p. <i>362</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00373&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a little-known study that was published as a technical report by the American
College Testing service, Lamb (1976) analyzed the structural validity of Holland's
model of career interests for the four ethnic minority groups including Asian
Americans. He found that the hexagonal structure was consistent across all of
the minority groups with the exception of the American Indian group. In other
words, the internal structure of Holland's model was the same for Asian Americans
as it was for White, Black, and Hispanic American high school students.
Unfortunately, this study was based on a relatively small sample of Asian Americans
(<i>N</i> = 102).


Another approach to understanding the career interests of Asian Americans
would be to examine the courses they take and the academic majors they choose
while in high school. Data from a recent National Science Foundation (1990)
report indicate that
<blockquote>
<p>
fully twice the proportion of Asians as Whites had a calculus course while in
high school: 36 percent versus 18 percent. Asians were also more apt to have
been in honors math courses.... Whereas almost all students had taken biology,
Asians reported taking a chemistry or physics course more often than Whites.
(p. 41)

fully twice the proportion of Asians as Whites had a calculus course while in
high school: 36 percent versus 18 percent. Asians were also more apt to have
been in honors math courses.... Whereas almost all students had taken biology,
Asians reported taking a chemistry or physics course more often than Whites.
(p. 41)


In terms of intended undergraduate major, Asian Amerians were twice as
likely to choose an engineering discipline. Within the sciences, Asians tended
more toward biology and computer science than did Whites. Asian Americans'
greater interest in scientific majors also was paralleled by a high level of educational
aspiration. More than two out of five Asian American freshmen planned
their highest degree to be either a doctorate or a medical degree compared to
one out of five White American freshmen who did so (National Science Foundation,
1990, p. 43).


According to the National Science Foundation (1990) report,
<blockquote>
<p>
coincident with their higher degree aspirations, over one-third of Asian freshmen
plan to become either engineers or physicians; this fraction compares to
only about a tenth of Whites. Among other careers, Asians choose elementary
or secondary teaching as their probable profession to a much lesser extent than
do Whites: 2 percent versus 9 percent. (p. 43)

do Whites: 2 percent versus 9 percent. (p. 43)


<b><i>Occupational Values</i></b>


On the whole, there also has been a lack of empirical studies on the work
values of Asian Americans. In an early dissertation, Tou (1974) compared the
work value orientations of Chinese American and White American 7th- and 8 th-grade
students in Catholic schools and designed a career intervention. Using Super's
(1970) Work Values Inventory, she found that cultural influences were associated
with the Chinese American students' work value orientations. The intervention
involved administering the Self-Directed Search in an attempt to increase the

[p. <i>363</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00374&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

More recently, Leong and Tata (1990) designed a study to determine what
work values were important to Chinese American children. The relation between
the Chinese American children's level of acculturation and work values also was
examined. Sex differences in work values among Chinese American 5th and 6th
graders were studied as well.


In the Leong and Tata (1990) study, 177 Chinese American 5th and 6th graders
in a Los Angeles inner-city elementary school were given the Ohio Work Values
Inventory (OWVI) and the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation scale (SL-ASIA).
The OWVI yields scores on 11 scales. The two most important values for
Chinese American children were money and task satisfaction. Object orientation
and solitude appeared to be of considerably lower importance. Boys valued object
orientation, self-realization, and ideas-data more than did girls. Girls valued altruism
more than did boys. These sex differences may represent non-culturespecific
sex differences in work values. The Chinese American children also were
divided into three groups according to their SL-ASIA scores: the low-acculturation
group, the medium-acculturation group, and the high-acculturation group.
Significant acculturation differences were found only for self-realization. Highacculturation
Chinese American children valued self-realization more than did
low-acculturation Chinese American children. The major aspect of self-realization
seems to be more a part of the White culture than of the Chinese American
culture. There are several limitations of this study. The lack of a comparable
White sample from a similar region, socioeconomic status, and time span was
noted.


Knowledge of this pattern of occupational values among Chinese American
children can serve as advance organizers for counselors who help this group of
minority children with their career planning. The challenge lies in broadening
the occupational options for Chinese American children while still respecting
their cultural values, which might underlie their occupational values.


In another study that examined both career development variables and occupational
values, Leong (1991) used Rosenberg's (1957) Occupational Values
Scale to compare the work values of 83 White American (46% male and 54%
female) and 63 Asian American (38% male and 62% female) college students.
The results related to the career development variables are discussed subsequently.
In terms of values, following the pattern used by Rosenberg, clusters of occupational
values were formed for analyses in the study: the social cluster, the extrinsic
cluster, the self-expression cluster, the power cluster, and the element of security.


The comparison of the two racial/ethnic groups revealed that Asian Americans
showed significant differences in terms of placing greater emphasis on the
extrinsic values than did White Americans. Asian Americans also significantly
valued security more than did White Americans. Hence, Asian American college
students, when compared to their White American peers, do show some significant
differences on occupational values. These differences could be because of
the Asian Americans' culture having a greater emphasis on pragmatism, a collectivistic

[p. <i>364</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00375&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The major implication of the Leong (1991) study for counseling is that Asian
Americans do seem to have differential occupational values when compared to
White Americans. Career counselors need to find ways of using a sufficiently
structured approach that is mindful of the occupational values of Asian Americans
(Leong &amp; Gim-Chung, 1995; Leong &amp; Leung, 1994). Asian American clients
might not appreciate counselors who direcdy or indirectly promote the use of a
more intrinsic set of work values with which to guide their career decision making.


<b><i>Career Development</i></b>


Research on career choice and development has been dominated by three
major theoretial perspectives: the person-environment interaction model as exemplified
by Holland's model, the developmental approaches as exemplied by
Super's (1970) theory, and the social learning approaches as delineated by Krumboltz
and Mitchell (see Brown &amp; Brooks, 1990). Within the developmental perspective,
the level and correlates of career maturity have been the most researched
construct. Crites (1978) defined career maturity as comprising five attitudinal components:
"(a) decisiveness in career decision making, (b) involvement in career decision
making, (c) independence in career decision making, (d) orientation to career
decision making, and (e) compromise in career decision making" (p. 3). As is evident
from these culture-bound components, there are likely to be cultural variations in
the construct of career maturity among Asian Americans (Leong &amp; Serafica, 1995).


In a study examining the differential career development attributes of Asian
American and White American college students, Leong (1991) used Crites's (1978)
Career Maturity Inventory: Attitude Scale; Harren's (1978) Assessment of Career
Decision-Making Style subscale; and Holland, Daiger, and Power's (1980) My
Vocational Situation on a sample of 83 White American (46% male and 54%
female) and 63 Asian American (38% male and 62% female) college students.
The Asian Americans were primarily of Chinese and Korean descent.


The Asian Americans exhibited higher levels of dependent decision-making
styles than did the White Americans. The Asian Americans also scored lower on
career maturity. There were no significant cultural differences for vocational identity.
Asian American college students, when compared to their White American
peers, did show some significant differences on career development attributes
and occupational values. These differences could be because of the Asian Americans'
culture having a greater emphasis on a collectivistic orientation in decision
making and could be influenced by the acculturation process (Leong, 1991).


The major implication of Leong's (1991) study for counseling is that Asian
Americans do seem to have differential career development attributes when compared
to White Americans. Career counselors need to be mindful that Asian
Americans might have preferences for different decision-making processes and
might on the surface appear less "career mature" than Whites. However, it also
should be recognized that most of the career maturity models and measures have

[p. <i>365</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00376&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i><b>Career Choices</b></i>


At first glance, it would seem that Asian Americans' career choices would be
a direct reflection of their career interests. However, as Leong (1982) pointed
out, due to a host of factors that have not yet been investigated empirically, Asian
Americans' career choices might not be consistently related to their career interests.
For example, many Asian American adolescents might be interested in artistic
careers (reflected in measured interests) but eventually might choose careers in
medicine or engineering (expressed interests or choices) because of parental guidance
or pressure.


This is quite likely to occur because many Asian American parents are aware
that discrimination in the work world is quite common and that their children
would have an easier time if they were in respected and autonomous professions
in which many Asian Americans already have succeeded. Hence, Asian American
parents might be more likely than White American parents to exert direct influence
on the career aspirations and choices of their children. In addition, the Asian
American youths would be more likely than White American youths to defer to
their parental guidance given the strong Asian value of respecting authority and
submitting to the wisdom of the elderly. For example, in Chinese American culture,
when parents give advice to their children they usually preface their remarks
with an observation such as "In my lifetime, I have eaten more salt than you have
eaten rice." Loosely translated, the saying implies that the elderly have much
more experience and, by extension, much more wisdom than do the young on
most matters. Therefore, to understand the career behavior of Asian Americans,
it would be important to examine their career interests and career choices separately.
It also would be important to examine when, why, and for whom the two
processess do not converge.


On a more general level, Hsia (1988) analyzed the major occupational groupings
that Asian Americans had chosen to enter using the 1980 U.S. census data.
Of the nine groups examined, Asian Americans were more likely than White
Americans to be in three of them. More than 18% of Asian Americans were in
professional occupations compared to 12.8% of White Americans, 5.5% of Asian
Americans were in technical occupations compared to 3.1% of White Americans,
and 15.6% of Asian Americans were in service occupations compared to 11.6%
of White Americans. Conversely, fewer Asian Americans were in sales (8.4%),
production/craft (8.4%), and operator/laborer occupations (14.2%) compared
to White Americans (10.7%, 13.4%, and 17.1%, respectively). Hsia also provided
similar data on specific Asian American subgroups (e.g., Japanese, Chinese, Filipino,
Korean).

[p. <i>366</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00377&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The greater tendency for Asian Americans to work in the professional and
technical occupations and the lower tendency to enter sales and laborer occupations
are consistent with some of the earlier observations about the pattern of
career interests made by Sue and Kirk (1972, 1973). Based on this set of data,
one can see why it is so common for the concept of the "model minority" to be
applied to Asian Americans. Using the criterion of occupational attainment alone,
Asian Americans as a group have fared quite well relative to other minority groups.
However, such an observation overlooks important intragroup differences. For
example, although Asian Americans as a group constitute 18.3% of professional
occupations relative to the 12.3% for White Americans, only 8.8% of Vietnamese
Americans are in professional occupations. Furthermore, 29.3% of Vietnamese
and 20.5% of Korean Americans are in operator/laborer occupations compared
to 17.1% of White Americans and 14.2% of Asian Americans overall (Hsia, 1988).
The model minority concept also ignores the problem of discrimination against
Asian Americans. Being successful is no guarantee against prejudice and discrimination.
This problem of occupational discrimination is discussed later in the chapter.


<b><i>Asian Americans in the Professions</i></b>


The representation of Asian Americans in their various professions was thoroughly
discussed by Hsia (1988) in her book, <i>Asian Americans in Higher Education
and at Work</i>. For our present purposes, we review some of the basic statistics
to highlight some issues with regard to Asian Americans' career choices in the
professions. Beginning with the legal profession, Hsia pointed out that data collected
since 1971 have shown that Asian Americans represent less than 1% of
the law student population. However, there has been a steady increase in Asian
American enrollment in law schools since 1973. In fact, the total number of first-year
Asian American students has doubled in the decade from 327 to 711. Hsia
also pointed out that despite this increase in the number of Asian Americans in
law schools, recent immigrants, because of their limited English-language ability,
are at a certain disadvantage in terms of access to law school educations.


In terms of medical school, Asian Americans have been a very visible minority
within this particular profession (Hsia, 1988). For example, in the 1979-1980
academic year, they constituted 3% of first-year and 2.8% of total medical student
enrollment. As Hsia pointed out, by the 1984-1985 academic year, Asian Americans
constituted 6.6% of first-year and 5.6% of total medical school enrollment.
This compares to Asian Americans representing 1.2% of the general U.S. population
in the 1970s and 3.0% in 1990. As the comparison has illustrated, Asian
Americans are "overrepresented" in medical schools. However, Hsia also pointed
out that, despite this overrepresentation relative to the proportion of Asians in
the U.S. population, Asian Americans do experience a lower level of application-to-acceptance
ratio than do other racial/ethnic groups. She further suggested that
this might be due to some discriminatory admissions policies occurring. In essence,
Asian Americans seem to gravitate toward medicine as a career choice.
Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons that have not yet been explicated, they

[p. <i>367</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00378&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hsia (1988) did not examine Asian Americans' representation in business
school; as such, no information was presented in her book. However, when we
examined the 1980 census, we found that in terms of actual representation in
the category of executive, administrative, and managerial occupations, the number
or percentage of Asian Americans relative to their population was comparable
for both groups. For example, White executive, administrative, and managerial
occupations represented 13.5% of all White individuals who were age 16 years
or over and employed. For Asian Americans, 13.2% of the Asian population were
in executive, administrative, or managerial occupations. It would be interesting
to determine whether the representation of Asians in business schools and the
like also is comparable or whether the Asian executives and business managers
enter those occupations without going through the traditional MBA and business
school training—in other words, that there actually might be two paths to becoming
an executive or a manager: White Americans might use business school
as a way in which to enter the profession, whereas Asian Americans might be
entering directly without the usual academic training.


<i><b>Personality Variables and
Asian Americans' Career Development</b></i>


In a review of the literature on the career development of Asian Americans,
Leong (1985) noted that there were three personality variables that were referred
to repeatedly in various studies concerning the vocational behavior of Asian Americans.
These three personality variables were locus of control, social anxiety, and
intolerance of ambiguity. With regard to locus of control, different studies have
pointed out that Asian Americans tend to be less autonomous, more dependent,
and more obedient to authority (Meredith, 1966; Sue &amp; Kirk, 1972, 1973).
Meredith's (1966) study, which used the Personality Factor Questionnaire, found
that Japanese American students were more "submissive, diffident, and regulated
by external realities" than the White students. Relatedly, Sue and Kirk (1972)
administered the Omnibus Personality Inventory to 236 Chinese American students
and found that they were significantly more conforming and socially introverted
than the White students. The authors went on to suggest that this high
level of conformity might be due to the traditional Chinese cultural values of
respect for authority and submergence of individuality. These findings seem to
suggest that Asian Americans, or at least Chinese and Japanese Americans, are
more externally oriented in terms of how they view issues of control and reinforcement.
In fact, Hsieh, Shybut, and Lotrof (1969) already had discovered that
Chinese Americans do score higher on Rotters' locus of control scale (i.e., more
external) than do White Americans. As suggested by Leong (1985), if indeed
Asian Americans perceived the locus of control for reinforcement as external, it
could affect not only their career decision-making style but also the nature and
scope of their career choices.

[p. <i>368</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00379&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Social anxiety was the second personality characteristic that Leong (1985)
identified as a converging theme within the literature. Besides clinical impressions
that Asian Americans are more emotionally withdrawn, socially isolated, and
verbally inhibited (Bourne, 1975; Sue &amp; Sue, 1974), various empirical studies
using objective and standardized personality instruments have found that Asian
Americans do experience a greater degree of social anxiety. Sue and Sue (1974),
in a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory comparison of Asian American
and White American students, found that the former exhibit greater social introversion.
In another study using the OPI, Sue and Kirk (1972) found that Chinese
American students were significantly more inhibited, were more impersonal
in their interpersonal relations, and appeared less socially concerned with
other people. In a related study using the same database as did that study, Sue
and Kirk (1973) found a similar pattern of social introversion and withdrawal
among both Chinese and Japanese American samples. They concluded that the
social discomfort experienced by these Asian American students might be due
to conflict between the informal nature of social relationships within American
culture and their own more formal and traditional cultural values and minority
status.


Leong (1985) also found that Fenz and Arkoff (1962) provided additional
confirming data on this social anxiety/discomfort phenomenon among Asian
Americans. Administering the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS) to
their participants, Fenz and Arkoff found that both Chinese and Filipino Americans
(and, to a lesser exent, Japanese Americans) scored higher on the deference
and abasement scales than did Whites. The Asian ethnic groups also scored lower
on the exhibition and aggression scales. Later on, but also using the EPPS with
Japanese Americans and White Americans as participants, Connor (1975) found
that the former exhibited greater need for deference, order, and abasement.


Sue (1975), in his chapter in Picou and Campbell's (1975) book, <i>Career Behavior
of Special Groups</i>, already had pointed out the relevance of Asian Americans'
social anxiety to their career aspirations and plans. Sue (1975) observed
that Asian Americans tend to withdraw from social contacts and responsibility.
Sue went on to point out that the tendency of Asian Americans to choose occupations
in the physical sciences and technical trades might be due to this social anxiety,
discomfort, and inhibition. In any event, Sue noted that Asian Americans are underrepresented
in the social sciences and other vocations that require verbal/pursuasive
skills and high levels of social interactions such as law and psychology.


Besides the personality dimensions identified by Leong (1985), Hsia (1980)
also discussed the role of a field-independent cognitive style among Asian Americans
in the occupational segregation and limited occupational mobility among
Asian Americans. She noted that given their field-independent orientation, Asian
Americans were much more likely to be limited to scientific and technical careers
and were not likely to be successful in the people-oriented occupations such as
managerial and administrative positions that require the more field-dependent
cognitive style. The relationship between field dependence/independence and
occupational choices already has been examined; the evidence supports Hsia's

[p. <i>369</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00380&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Some of the data from personality inventories already provide some support
for Hsia's (1980) and Leong's (1985) hypotheses about the influence of personality
variables on the career behavior of Asian Americans. For example, Sue and
Frank's (1973) study, which was done on 69% of entering freshman males at
Berkeley in the fall of 1966, found that Asian males leaned toward occupations
encompassing routine business-detail activities. They were overrepresented in
engineering and underrepresented in the social sciences. Asian men tended to
score low in autonomy; they tended to be more conforming, more obedient to
authority, and more connected to familial control. They tended to dislike ambiguity.
They also experienced strong feelings of isolation, loneliness, and rejection.


Similarly, Sue and Kirk (1972) found that Japanese American students were
less oriented toward theoretical or abstract ideas and concepts than were White
American students. Japanese American students also tended to dislike ambiguity
in favor of structured situations. They tended to evaluate ideas based on immediate
practical applications and were more socially conforming.


In a study examining the influence of the sex-role identity and occupational
attainment of Asian American women's psychological well-being, Chow (1987)
tested three hypotheses: (a) both masculine and androgynous Asian American
women would have a higher level of occupational attainment than would those
with feminine and undifferentiated sex-role identities; (b) androgynous Asian
American women would have a higher level of self-esteem and greater work satisfaction
than would those with other sex-role identities; and (c) the higher the
level of occupational attainment secured by Asian American women, the higher
their level of self-esteem and work satisfaction.


In Chow's (1987) survey, 161 Asian American women (Chinese, Japanese,
Korean, and Filipino) were rated for occupational attainment, work satisfaction,
and self-esteem. Most of the individuals were employed full-time, and information
was obtained through the Bern Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), the Self-Esteem
Scale, and interviews.


The results of the study supported all three of the hypotheses just stated.
Chow (1987) also questioned Bern's assertion that androgyny benefits behavioral
adaptivity and personal competence because it was masculinity and not androgyny
that was linked to the greatest occupational attainment among Asian American
women. However, this study points to androgyny as being a positive and
healthy state for women given that androgynous Asian American women scored
high levels of self-esteem.


Interestingly, feminine women scored higher in both self-esteem and work
satisfaction than did masculine women. This is perhaps due to the stronger emphasis
of femininity in women that is placed by Asian culture. The concluding
results appeared to indicate that both masculine and feminine qualities are important
for the career development and physiological well-being of Asian American

<b><i>Work Adjustment and Vocational Problems</i></b>


Asian Americans experience both a unique set of work adjustment problems
and vocational problems common to many minority groups. One work adjustment
problem that many Asian Americans have to deal with concerns their academic
abilities. As measured by tests such as the SAT, Asian Americans tend to
have lower levels of verbal skills in English than do White Americans. In 1988,
Asian SAT verbal scores averaged 408, which was 37 points lower than the average
for Whites (445). On the other hand, the average mathematics score for Asians
(552) was 62 points higher than that for Whites (490) (National Science Foundation,
1990). Although never investigated systematically, it is easy to envision
that many Asian Americans experience career-related problems due to their limited
ability with the English language. For example, Asian Americans might be
perceived as less intelligent or less competent than their White counterparts on
the job because they are not able to articulate what they know fully. This, in turn,
could lead to consequences such as being passed over for promotion to managerial
or supervisory positions or receiving lower ratings in performance appraisals.


Asian Americans' higher ability with mathematics also is a double-edged sword.
Whereas the higher mathematics scores have helped balance out their lower verbal
scores and increased their chances of admission into colleges and graduate programs,
the combination of the two also creates a certain image. The popular
stereotypical version of this image is of Asian Americans being engineering or
computer science "geeks"—bespectacled, slide rules sticking out of their pockets,
and spending all of their time buried in books. However one chooses to characterize
this image, the impression is that Asian Americans are best at being "technicians,"
and not managers and supervisors, because they lack the social skills
stemming from their lower verbal skills.


There is some evidence that Asian Americans do perceive themselves to be
underemployed at work regardless of whether it is related to these stereotypes.
In a recent national survey conducted by the Gallup organization, Brown et al.
(1991) reported in their telephone survey of 1,350 adults (age 18 years or older)
from three major minority groups—African Americans (<i>n</i> = 737), Hispanics
(<i>n</i> = 310), and APIs (<i>n</i> = 255)—that APIs (47%) were less likely than Whites
(54%), African Americans (60%), or Hispanics (63%) to report that their skills
were being used very well. Large percentages of APIs (71%) and Hispanics (75%)
also reported being interested in getting more information about careers if they
could start over. More Asian Americans also reported experiencing stress on the
job than did other minority groups; African Americans (59%) and Hispanics
(61%) were significantly more likely than Whites (46%) or APIs (48%) to report
little or no job stress.

[p. <i>371</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00382&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a study of Asian American students' help-seeking behavior and problem
perception, Tracey, Leong, and Glidden (1986) found that Asian Americans were
more likely to present vocational and career problems than personal-emotional
problems to a counselor. They used archival data consisting of all clients seen at
the student development center at the University of Hawaii at Manoa between
the fall of 1980 and the spring of 1983. The final sample of 3,050 student clients
consisted of the following ethnic groups: White, Chinese American, Filipino American,
part Hawaiian, Korean American, Japanese American, Asian American-White
mix, and Asian American mix.


Tracey et al. (1986) found that the problem endorsement rates differed significantly
among the groups on each of the eight problem areas. Those problems
reflecting interpersonal or intrapersonal concerns were disproportionately overendorsed
by the Whites and fairly uniformly underendorsed by the Asian Americans.
The Filipino American and Asian American-White mix students lay between
the majority White students and the rest of the Asian American groups in endorsing
these areas as concerns. All of the other areas (e.g., academic/career)
seemed to be overendorsed by the Asian American students and underendorsed
by the White students.


Asian American men were less likely to endorse more than one problem than
were White men, whereas Asian American women were more likely to endorse
more than one problem than were White women. Asian American clients were
less likely to have had previous counseling. White clients were more likely to
endorse a personal concern as paramount, especially if they had previous counseling.
Asian American clients were more likely to endorse academic/vocational
concerns as most important, but to a lesser degree if they had previous counseling
(Tracey et al., 1986).


Yu and Wu's (1985) article addressed a unique work adjustment problem
experienced by Chinese Americans, namely the stress from being unable to provide
for extended family members. Because the ability to assist financially in the
care of aged relatives often is dependent on one's employment and income, Yu
and Wu examined the relationship among unemployment, marital status, and
discomfort experienced by Chinese American adults when providing support to
their parents and parents-in-law.


Combining the city directory with the university faculty and student directories,
Yu and Wu (1985) found 1,005 people with Chinese surnames. They then
cross-referenced the three directories and obtained a list of 872 unduplicated
names with verifiable addresses. From this total sample, 510 respondents (59%)
returned the self-administered questionnaires. Although the age of respondents
ranged from 18 to 90 years, the sample population was relatively young (mean
age 35 ± 15).


Yu and Wu (1985) found that 45% (<i>n</i> = 88) of the single respondents were
employed and 55% (<i>n</i> = 106) were not employed; of the married respondents,
77% (<i>n</i> = 228) were employed and 23% (<i>n</i> = 69) were not employed (this was
due mainly to respondents who were full-time students). Their data also showed
that among the married couples, 64% reported that both spouses were employed,

[p. <i>372</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00383&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The levels of stress reported in YU and Wu's (1985) investigation were not
the same for American-born (24% of their sample were American born) and naturalized
Chinese Americans. The American-born respondents tended to be younger,
to earn less money, and to be more acculturated to American traditions than did
the naturalized Chinese Americans. The American-born respondents believed in
giving financial support to aged parents, but few actually did so; many of them
said that their parents did not need help because they still were young, that their
parents' economic situations were better than their own, and/or that they did
not believe in cohabitation with their parents.


Yu and Wu's (1985) sample did not exhibit the traditional Chinese pattern
of family responsibility, as 46% of married females worked outside the home;
some contributed economically to their in-laws through financial assistance and
cohabitation, whereas others contributed economically to their own parents as
well. The authors found that married women's parents lived with their families
as often as did the husbands' parents. They also found that 44% of married women
gave support to their in-laws, but when they explored the question of whether
a difference existed between the husband's and the wife's discomfort toward
their respective parents-in-law with regard to financial and housing issues, they
found no difference in discomfort levels. In 58 (81%) out of 72 married couples,
both husband and wife gave support to their own parents. In the sample, women
were not only working outside the home but also contributing financially to their
own parents' needs.


Employment status affected the discomfort level of males, with the unemployed
reporting the highest discomfort among four groups in providing financial
support to aged parents. Marital status interacted with employment status; married
employed persons tended to give support to their parents (in 58 out of 72
couples, both spouses gave to their parents). The married respondents tended to
be older; among the 72 married couples, the mean age of those for whom both
spouses worked was 42 years. Among this group, 54% of married males and 46%
of married females worked. Higher income, however, did not necessarily mean
that these respondents had more money to spend. Some of them probably had
college-aged children who also depended on them for support.


Yu and Wu (1985)also found an interaction between employment and marital
status with the housing issue; married and employed respondents, regardless of
gender, cohabitated with their parents or parents-in-law more often than did
single respondents. Again, the married and employed respondents were older,
had higher incomes, and probably resided in better housing. However, very few
respondents reported that their parents-in-law were living with them or intended
to live with them permanently as was the custom in traditional China. Moreover,
a high correlation was found between the husband's and the wife's discomfort
level with regard to giving money to parents and living with parents-in-law, indicating
that the husband's discomfort in meeting financial and housing needs
was related to his wife's discomfort and vice versa.

[p. <i>373</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00384&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Yu and Wu (1985) concluded that employment decreased the discomfort levels
of respondents if they met their aging relatives' needs but that employment
status alone was not the deciding factor in meeting those needs. Marital status
interacted with employment in the provision of both financial and housing assistance;
employed married respondents gave money and lived with their aged
relatives more often than did unemployed and/or single respondents. Furthermore,
the discriminating factor in meeting aged relatives' needs was providing
financial aid to parents-in-law; respondents who did not give support to their
parents-in-law reported higher discomfort than did those who did give such support,
regardless of whether they gave support to or lived with their own parents.
Finally, one spouse's discomfort in meeting such needs affected the discomfort
level of the other spouse.


Related to the preceding study, Sung (1987, as cited in Liu, Yu, Chang, &amp;
Fernandez, 1990) found that the lengthy absence of many Chinese American
parents from home created a major stressor for the whole family. The absences
were necessitated by both parents having to work long hours to support the family.
Sung (1987) interpreted her data to support the idea that these long absences
contributed significantly to Chinese teenagers becoming gang members to substitute
for a sense of identity and belonging that was unavailable at home.


Redding and Ng (1982) also examined a culturally related work adjustment
problem among the Chinese. They investigated the role of "face" in the organizational
perceptions among Chinese managers. Although the study was conducted
on Chinese and not Chinese Americans, it is included here because it
investigated an important dimension that was worthy of exploration and might
have parallels for Chinese Americans.


According to Redding and Ng (1982), face is particularly salient for the Chinese
and is argued to be a key in explaining much of their behavior. Their article
discussed the operation of face in the Chinese business context, indicating the
power of face as a mediating force in social interactions, in business transactions,
or in social situations inside formal organizations.


Redding and Ng (1982) described two dimensions to the Chinese concept
of face and discussed it by using either of the two words <i>lien</i> or <i>mien-tzu</i>. Lien
is good moral character and is more ascribed than achieved. Mien-tzu is the idea
of the reputation based on one's own efforts and is more achieved than ascribed.
Face is the individual's assessment of how others chose to see him or her. In
business behavior, the great importance of trust in Chinese business relationships
and the resulting informality as to contracts and agreements rest on the common
adoption of lien as a moral foundation.


Research was conducted with 102 Chinese middle-level executives in commercial,
trading, and engineering companies in Hong Kong. First, a bilingual
questionnaire was administered covering different aspects of the perception of
face and its operation. Second, in individual interviews, respondents were asked
to describe specific face incidents from their experiences.


The salience of status and power was made clear. The reactions to losing
face were shame (100% of respondents); worry (99%); feelings of uneasiness,

[p. <i>374</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00385&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When respondents were asked whether having face influenced success in
daily business transactions and negotiations, the response was 100% strongly
positive. Almost equally strongly negative (97%) was not having face. The process
of being given face during a transaction also was seen as highly favorable (96%).
To have one's face challenged or deliberately destroyed was seen as highly unfavorable
(100%). In addition, 100% of the sample responded that if they were
being given face, then they would give it back in return. If their face were being
challenged or attacked, then 80% of the respondents indicated they would retaliate
by destroying the other's face in return and 20% would retaliate by simply
not giving face (Redding &amp; Ng, 1982).


The objective of the content analysis of the incidents was to investigate themes.
The first grouping of classification deals with <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> it operates, and the
second deals with <i>where</i> and <i>when</i> it operates. There is commonly a fundamental
clash between the behaviors needed when taking face into account and those
needed to meet the rational needs of the organization. Typical problems referred
to in the original accounts are having to restrain from criticizing a subordinate
because of face obligation to a third party who has been a sponsor, extra costs
involved in meeting customer requirements so as not to lose face with the customer,
dilution of managerial authority due to loss of face, and the risks involved
in transactions based on trust and on the maintenance of face. There is some
acknowledgment of the advantage of using face in business transactions. The
appropriateness of a Western bureaucracy form of organization to the Oriental
context is a question of the clash of two Western values—rationality and individualism
—with Oriental values of a different and not so simply classifiable nature.
On these grounds, Redding and Ng (1982) argued that the introduction of
Western managerial systems will either meet resistance or be subjected to extensive
adaptation.


In one of only a few studies that examined gender issues in the work adjustment
of Asian Americans, Fujii, Fukushima, and Chang (1989) examined the
experiences and thoughts of Asian women psychiatrists who must deal with the
impact of gender, race, and culture on the evolution of their careers. In the study,
10 Asian American women in the psychiatry field were given a 90-minute semistructured
interview. This allowed for the collection of demographic data and
for each respondent to relate her experiences in an open-ended fashion. Interviews
were conducted with 2 Chinese, 2 Filipinos, 4 Japanese, 1 Vietnamese,
and 1 Korean. Ages ranged from 26 to 44 years, with a mean age of 35.


There were significant differences between the foreign medical graduates
(FMGs) and those who were trained in the United States. The FMGs were older,
were married to men of the same ethnicity, had retained their religious ties, and
were the eldest in their families. The non-FMGs were generally younger and
were married to or involved with men who were ethnically dissimilar to them

[p. <i>375</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00386&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As a general rule, families of the women had disapproved of their career
choices. There is not as much respect for psychiatrists in the United States and
Asia as there is for surgeons. Racism and positive and negative stereotyping by
residence faculty, colleagues, and patients appeared to be present, albeit sometimes
subtly. Some of the women felt "pushed" into minority issues or felt pressure
to behave in a certain way.


All of the women reported satisfaction with their professional lives. They
were deeply committed to their profession. FMGs relied on family and religion
to help them through difficult times. It appears that they assimilated but did not
acculturate. Non-FMGs were more similar to their mainstream colleagues.


Both in the United States and in Asian countries, psychiatry is not considered
a "typical" choice for Asians, who usually are expected to excel in mathematics,
science, engineering, and computer science. The Asian women who chose medicine
and eventually psychiatry differed from Asian women in the United States
and in their native lands. Most were the eldest in their families and had experienced
unusual life circumstances such as fleeing a native land that was under
siege, facing the possibility of a fatal illness, having a life-changing mentor, or
dealing with personal periods of emotional stress with self-recognized and acknowledged
mood disturbance. The number of Asian women psychiatrists in the
United States is small but growing. Fujii et al. (1989) pointed out that future
inquiry into this subpopulation of Asian Americans might include issues related
to stereotyping and its effects, training, transference, countertransference, and
therapy for Asian women psychiatrists.


Another common problem experienced by many Asian American groups
concerns the impact of migration on their work adjustment in the host country.
Kincaid and Yum (1987) examined some of the socioeconomic consequences of
the migration of Samoans, Koreans, and Filipinos in Hawaii in contrast to local
Japanese and Caucasian residents. Special attention was given to income levels,
occupational mobility, and difficulty of adjustment as indicated by the incidence
of stressful life events.


Kincaid and Yum's (1987) results were obtained by means of a cross-sectional
sample survey conducted in Honolulu and Hilo from 1978 to 1979 from independendy
drawn samples of first-generation immigrants from Korea, the Philippines,
and Samoa as well as from resident Japanese Americans and Caucasian Americans
who were born in Hawaii or migrated there from Japan or the U.S. mainland.
All data were collected by face-to-face home interviews by native-language speakers
from the same ethnic group. There were approximately similar-size samples
of males and females from each ethnic group except for the Filipino sample,
which was only 36% male.


Filipinos had the lowest average level of education with 8 years as compared
to 11 years for Samoans, 12 years for Koreans, 13 years for Japanese, and 15
years for Caucasians. This order of educational experience corresponds exactly

[p. <i>376</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00387&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

According to Kincaid and Yum (1987), one of the main consequences of
migration is the intensification of the differences in occupational prestige between
the Caucasians and Japanese, on the one hand, and the three immigrant groups,
on the other. The second most important consequence was the striking decrease
in occupational status of Korean men relative to Caucasians from the U.S. mainland
and the decrease in the mean occupational prestige of Samoan men relative
to Filipino men. The third most important result of the analysis was the overall
difference in occupational mobility across the four migrant groups after they
arrived in Hawaii.


The Samoans had experienced greater amounts of stress as a group than had
any of the other groups. Second were the Koreans, then the Caucasians, then the
Japanese, and then the Filipinos. The Caucasians reported the highest incidence
of outstanding personal achievement of 13% as compared to 3% for the Japanese,
2% for the Koreans, 1% for the Filipinos, and no occurrence at all for the Samoans.
The greatest incidence of dissatisfaction was expressed by the Korean immigrants.


Samoans made greater use of the Social Security Administration (29%) than
did the other two immigrant groups, with 25% of Filipinos and only 3% of Koreans
reporting having used the Social Security Administration. More people were
aware of social agencies than had ever used them. The most serious information
gap or problem of awareness was among the Samoan immigrants.


Kincaid and Yum (1987) also observed that one of the main results of mi~gration
was a substantial drop in occupational prestige for the three immigrant
groups and for the Caucasians. The Korean immigrants had experienced the greatest
decrease of status among all ethnic groups in Hawaii. The authors concluded
from this study that the needs of each immigrant group were different and that
social policies should reflect these differences in their priorities.


Several studies also have examined the work adjustment problems experienced
by Southeast Asian immigrants and refugees. In the first of these studies,
Vertiz and Fortune (1984) reported on an intervention program for Blacks, Hispanics,
Chicanos, American Indians, and Indochinese at J. E. B. Stuart High School
in Fairfax County, Virginia. The program was designed to meet some of the employment
and support service needs of the school's foreignborn-tudents, with
an emphasis on Indochinese. The program, which was geared to enrollees of
English as a second language (ESL) classes (particularly to those who were not
progressing rapidly in English), serves other foreign born as well. The authors
also described some of the effects of cultural discrepancies on the employment
of Indochinese youths.

[p. <i>377</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00388&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Vertiz and Fortune (1984) observed that the majority of foreign-born students
lacked necessary skills to obtain jobs because of language and cultural differences.
For instance, to show respect, Indochinese children must keep their eyes lowered
when speaking to adults. In the United States, during a job interview, eye contact
is equated with honesty, sincerity, and straightforwardness. Hence, the Indochinese
often were misread in their attempts to show respect.


These and other "cultural discrepancies" also caused obvious employer-employee
misunderstandings in the American workplace, where subordinates
were expected to ask questions to learn or to clarify instructions. The fact that
most Indochinese are embarrassed about their limited knowledge of English also
contributed to their hesitation to ask questions or to say what was on their minds.


Vertiz and Fortune's (1984) workshops employed the concept of self-directed
placement and focused on developing the qualities necessary to communicate
effectively in an interview. Based on trust building, activities were conducted in
small groups and met the following broad objectives: (a) identification of personal
values, interests, aptitudes, and abilities; (b) communication of personal qualities
to others; (c) identification of at least two types of pre-entry-level jobs that would
provide viable experience toward tentative career options; (d) location of possible
employment sites; (e) establishment of personal contact with potential employers
to inquire about part-time jobs; (f) completion of a job application; and (g) interviews
in small groups with personnel specialists from business and industry as
well as in a one-to-one situation with videotape. Vertiz and Fortune reported that
the participants in the workshops showed considerable progress in learning job
interviewing skills.


In another study examining the adjustment of Southeast Asian refugees in
the United States, Nicassio and Pate (1984) sought to identify major obstacles to
resettlement as perceived by the refugees, to evaluate interrelationships between
problems of adjustment, and to study the influence of pertinent sociodemographic
factors on various indexes of adjustment.


The first phase of the project consisted of a mail survey with a questionnaire.
Information was obtained on the sociodemographic characteristics of the refugees,
their awareness and use of social services, and their evaluation of the magnitude
of their adjustment problems. A total of 968 completed instruments were
received, representing a response rate of approximately 43%. The second and
third phases of the project were a lengthier questionnaire administered to 349
Indochinese attending ESL classes and interviews with 460 heads of household
who had not participated in the two previous phases. The combination of these
three phases yielded a sample size of 1,638.


Data on two measures of adjustment were reported in Nicassio and Pate's
(1984) article. The first measure was a problem index that consisted of the responses
to 32 potential problems of adjustment. Also, refugees who were interviewed
in their homes responded to a 10-item measure of alienation.


Respondents were predominantly male, young, and of Vietnamese extraction.
There was considerable financial deprivation shown in the sample. The

[p. <i>378</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00389&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Problems of separation and emigration stress received major emphasis. Also
regarded as very serious were problems such as learning to speak English, finances,
job skills, and medical care, which reflected the most imminent survival needs of
the refugees. The reporting of problems in specific areas was predictive of adjustment
difficulty in all other areas.


From the pattern of correlations in the Nicassio and Pate (1984) study, it is
evident that refugees who were more advanced in age, had less education and
income, were unemployed, and had resided in the United States for shorter periods
of time reported more adjustment difficulty. The social adjustment of
refugees to the new cultural setting was very significantly related to their socioeconomic
level. The socioeconomic, psychological, and cultural dimensions of
adjustment among refugees and immigrants probably are interactive and mutually
dependent.


Nicassio and Pate (1984) concluded that the results of their investigation had
significant practical implications for services rendered to the Indochinese during
their resettlement. First, interventions that consolidate or develop the support
systems and networks of refugees would appear to be particularly valuable. Second,
services that enhance the educational and job-related skills of refugees should
receive major emphasis because improvement in the socioeconomic area might
facilitate psychosocial adjustment. The results also indicated that work adjustment
was a major problem.


In a similar study, Matsuoka and Ryujin (1989) collected panel data on 125
Vietnamese refugee families drawn from the San Diego area. Neighborhoods
reflecting different income levels were selected to ensure a more representative
sample. Letters were sent to potential respondents requesting interviews. Once
a request was accepted, an interview was conducted with at least one member
of that family. A team of six bilingual Vietnamese conducted the interviews. Generally
speaking, the refugees were extremely suspicious of the interviewers.


The interviews were designed to collect information in several critical areas.
These areas included (a) background information on each respondent (e.g., age,
religious affiliation), (b) circumstances surrounding the respondent's evacuation
from Vietnam, (c) sponsorship experiences, (d) patterns of mobility since arriving
in the United States, (e) employment history, (f ) the refugee community, (g) mental
health, and (h) prospects for the future. Findings indicated that Vietnamese refugees
were experiencing difficulties in adjustment associated with learning a new culture
and leaving behind parts of an old one. Many of the respondents who stated
that they had no problem adjusting to life in the United States were young people.


In Matsuoka and Ryujin's (1989) study 75% of the respondents believed
that their children would be more successful than they would, and 47% felt that
they would not be able to attain what they had obtained in Vietnam. However,
40% felt that they would be able to climb back to where they had been or even
surpass their accomplishments in Vietnam.

[p. <i>379</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00390&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Fully 88% of parents wanted their children to retain traditional aspects of
Vietnamese culture. Filial piety was an important issue for parents, as 39% thought
that their children would retain this characteristic and 38% said that they could
only hope for it. Only 11% of the respondents felt that its value would diminish
among their children's generation.


Vietnamese enclaves in the resettlement and psychological adjustment of Vietnamese
refugees were extremely important. These communities appear to be
an important source of mutual support. The biggest adjustment problems for
refugees deal with language, cultural differences, and employment. What refugees
miss most about Vietnam are the emotional support of loved ones and the cultural
way of life inherent to their country. Many refugees enjoy the freedom, opportunities,
and comforts provided by the United States, but a quarter of the Vietnar
iese said that there was nothing they liked about the United States. Many
resrriricted themselves materially to minimize their feelings of guilt.


Matsuoka and Ryujin (1989) argued that American social workers could provide
services that help the refugees to survive in American society—language
trailing, job training, access to employment, economic support, courses on the
U.S. culture, and counseling on how to obtain all of these.


Haines (1987) also found employment to be a major source of stress for
Southeast Asian refugees. His article addressed three distinct issues in the study
of Southeast Asian refugee employment: the general patterns in Southeast Asian
refugee employment in the United States, the major correlates of refugee employment,
and statistical analysis of the relative effects of these different
correlates. There were consistent patterns in refugee employment, consistently
appearing correlates of employment success, but a somewhat less consistent
set of statistical interpretations of these patterns and correlates.


As labor force participation rises in a consistent fashion, unemployment rates
drop. Very severe employment problems are faced by refugees on their arrival in
the United States, many of which are the result of refugee exodus. These problems
are then reflected in the receipt of various forms of public assistance, whose figures
decrease from very high initial levels to the approximate one third in assistance
among refugees resident in the United States for more than 3 years. The consistent
pattern of economic improvement has three elements: increasing labor force participation,
declining unemployment, and declining receipt of public assistance.


There exists much documentation of these improvements. However, there
is a difficult initial situation that permits such an impressive improvement, and
figures have shown a potential downward shift over time in that starting point.
Also, there is only limited improvement in wage and salary income, and economic
self-sufficiency often is due to an increase in the number of jobs in the household
rather than to any great increase in the income from individual jobs. Refugees
may well end up in dead-end jobs and lack occupational mobility after arrival.
Perhaps the most crucial issue is the jobs that refugees obtain. There is an initial
downward step that might not be ameliorated over time.


Three correlates seem related to occupational attainment: ability to understand
and communicate in English, occupational background in Southeast Asia,

[p. <i>380</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00391&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In another study of Southeast Asians, Tang and O'Brien (1990) defined the
vocational expectations of the Indochinese refugees by their willingness to stay
on low-status jobs. The authors used existing vocational data from a social service
organization. The data consisted mainly of demographic information related to
the refugees and the positions into which they were placed.


Status inconsistency was operationally defined as the difference in occupational
status between the refugees' previous positions in their homeland and their
present positions. Vocational success was defined as the length of time the refugees
spent on their present jobs.


Participants were 529 Indochinese refugees (337 males and 192 females)
who used the employment placement services of the Center for Southeast Asian
Refugee Resettlement between 1981 and 1984. The following variables were
collected: (a) number of days worked before quitting or being fired from the
most recent job placement, (b) job retention during the monitoring period (90
days), (c) starting wage in the most recent job placement, (d) welfare status, (e)
English proficiency, (f) age, (g) number of languages spoken, (h) number of jobs
held in the United States before placement, (i) education, (j) months in the Unifed
States before receiving job placement, and (k) prestige of the individual's current
job placement, last job in Indochina, the position currently desired, and the ultimately
desired career position. Intercorrelations among all variables were computed.


Participants who had been in America for fewer than 3 years worked an
average of 53 days on their previous job placement, whereas those who had been
in America for more than 3 years worked an average of 77 days. The longer the
individual had stayed in America, the greater the likelihood of vocational success.
Before 3 years of residence in America, individuals who had held low-prestige
positions in Asia worked longer than did their high-prestige counterparts. After
the 3-year period, the situation was reversed, with those individuals .who previously
held high-prestige positions working much longer than their previously
low-prestige counterparts. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) using gender, age,
educational level, and public assistance as predictors of vocational success yielded
nonsignificant results.


Tang and O'Brien's (1990) study provided evidence that status inconsistency
affected the vocational success of the Indochinese refugees. Those refugees who
had more than 3 years of residence exhibited fewer psychosocial problems than
did those who had less than 3 years of residence. Once the immigrants had become
culturally acclimated, achieving vocational goals that were consistent with their
self-concept became more important. Former high-prestige refugees might attempt
to reduce the dissonance produced by status incongruence by leaving lowstatus
positions in a desire to seek positions more consistent with their expectations

[p. <i>381</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00392&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The Tang and O'Brien (1990) findings have an important implication for
refugee assistance efforts. Agency interventions with status-inconsistent individuals
should be focused on maintaining and enhancing self-esteem. Also, the counselor
might try to convince the refugees that there are other aspects to a job (e.g.,
learning new skills, helping to fulfill the goals of the larger organization, earning
a wage or salary) that are as important as job prestige.


In the final study concerned with Southeast Asians, Anh and Healy (1985)
examined the factors believed to affect the job satisfaction of Vietnamese refugees.
Participants were 210 Vietnamese refugees drawn randomly from the public social
service rosters of Los Angeles and Orange counties in California in 1979 and
interviewed in 1980. Of these, 127 worked full-time, 23 worked part-time, and
60 were unemployed. There were 88 women and 122 men. The mean income
was $5,423. The participants had been in the United States for an average of 3.4
years.


The questionnaire had 131 items related to aspects of work and resettlement
in the United States. The authors used ANOVA and chi-square to ascertain whether
being employed and feeling satisfied with one's job related to length of time
in the United States, estimated English proficiency, and views about job-seeking
resources.


On average, the immigrants were moderately satisfied with their jobs. Overall
satisfaction related moderately and positively to wages and related negatively to
number of obstacles to having the desired job. Among the participants, 39% believed
they lacked job skills, 30% thought they needed more job information,
26% reported a scarcity of suitable jobs and inadequate transportation, 21% felt
isolated, and 10% felt discouraged. On average, the refugees judged their English
proficiency as moderate.


Ratings on the helpfulness of seven job-seeking resources were skewed negatively.
Only Vietnamese friends were generally considered somewhat helpful; all
other sources were considered somewhat less than helpful. The comparisons showed
a significant positive relationship between time in the United States and employment
status and satisfaction. The unemployed averaged 2.6 years in the United
States, whereas part- and full-time workers averaged 3.6 years. Refugees in the
United States for 3 or more years were more satisfied than were those present 1
or 2 years, and those in the United States 2 years were more satisfied than those
present 1 year or less.


English proficiency was not found to be related to employment or employment
status, but it was significantly related to job satisfaction. Of the variables
considered in Anh and Healy's (1985) study, time was the most consistent in its
relation to the refugees' resettlement. Refugees who were in the United States
the longest were most likely to have jobs and to feel satisfied with their jobs. It
is important, however, for future research to verify that increases in satisfaction
over time do not merely indicate that refugees have settled for poor jobs.

[p. <i>382</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00393&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Anh and Healy (1985) concluded that Vietnamese face many of the same
obstacles that other refugees have encountered including nonrecognition of their
degrees and skills, lack of information about the labor market, licensing restrictions,
lack of an established ethnic support community, and regulations limiting
training to citizens or established residents.


In another study related to job satisfaction, McNeely (1987) surveyed Asian
American human service workers. A survey was mailed to 2,925 county human
service workers located in geographically disparate areas of the United States and
yielded 68 Asian American and 1,299 other respondents. A portion of the sample
(210 respondents) was eliminated because they had moved, so the final response
rate was 50.3%.


Participating respondents were given a questionnaire consisting of 115
Likert-type items. Several questions focused on demographic data—age, length
of employment, education, income, and occupational status, among others. Three
indexes were incorporated into the instrument. The Science Research Associates
Attitude Survey determines precise correlates of job satisfaction; the 78 items
pinpoint specific aspects of respondents' working conditions. The Index of Job
Satisfaction (IJS) focuses on employees' subjective assessments regarding their
jobs. It consists of 18 items, and its scores determine overall levels of job satisfaction.
The third index, the Morse Index of Intrinsic Job Satisfaction, assesses
intrinsic job satisfaction—those aspects of the job that satisfy what has been described
as workers' fundamental need for creative and challenging work.


A statistically significant difference was observed for occupational status, with
disproportionate underrepresentation of Asian Americans in both managerial and
supervisory positions and overrepresentation in paraprofessional positions. The
data did not reveal any significant differences between Asian American and non-Asian
workers in length of employment. Even though the Asian American respondents
had attained higher levels of education, they earned less. The Asian
American families appeared to be more stable than those of other workers. No
statistical differences were observed for age.


There were no significant differences between the Asian American and non-Asian
respondents on either overall (Index of Job Satisfaction) or intrinsic (Morse
Index) satisfaction. The job satisfaction of Asian American respondents was affected
substantially by their perception of whether or not "most of the ‘higher-ups’
are friendly toward employees." This finding fits with the perhaps stereotypical
belief that Asian Americans are more affected by their treatment at the hands of
superiors than are other racial groups. The "most of the ‘higher-ups’ are friendly
toward employees" variable was virtually unrelated to the non-Asian respondents'
level of satisfaction (McNeely, 1987).


<b>GROUP AND SOCIETAL LEVELS OF ANALYSIS</b>


Psychology as a field of scientific inquiry has tended to employ an individual
level of analysis with a few exceptions. These exceptions include social psychology,

[p. <i>383</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00394&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>Family Influences on the Career
Development of Asian Americans</i></b>


Psychologists and other social scientists have long indicated that the family
plays a central role in the lives of Asian Americans that is different from the role
it plays in the lives of White Americans (e.g., Sue &amp; Morishima, 1982). Yet very
little research has been conducted on the influence of the family on the career
choices and behaviors of Asian Americans. There have been, however, a few studies
to date.


Evanoski and Tse (1989) described a career awareness program for Chinese
and Korean American parents. They argued that education and career choices
are of great importance to many Chinese and Korean families. The crucial role
of Chinese and Korean parents in the career choice of their children makes it
imperative that they not be omitted from the career counseling efforts of the
educational institutions.


The main goal of the career awareness program for Chinese and Korean
American parents was to establish a linkage whereby role models of similar cultures
and backgrounds could use their prestige and knowledge to inform parents
of career opportunities for their children. Another goal was to explain the concept
of the community college and the academic and career programs available, thus
offering a great variety of career choices to newly arrived immigrants and their
children.


The role models were professionals identified by closely knit networks in
the Chinese and Korean communities. They had to have several years of professional
working experience, be good speakers, and be willing to serve the community
by volunteering to make presentations. A series of 10 separate workshops
for each school year were planned, with each workshop being a complete program.
Each workshop was approximately 3 hours long. After the more formal
presentations by the role models, there were question-and-answer exchanges with
the parents.


The workshops served 1,140 Chinese and Korean parents and 551 students
in the 1985-1986 school year as well as 1,413 Chinese and Korean parents and
1,987 students in the 1986-1987 school year. A survey was filled out by 550
persons during 1985-1986 and by 801 persons during 1986-1987. More than

[p. <i>384</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00395&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Evanoski and Tse (1989) pointed out that the most useful strategy in starting
such programs seems to be the concept of a bilingual role model. It also was
recommended that written materials be prepared in the native language of the
target group. Linkage with community organizations of the special target population
also was critical to the success of such programs.


In one of only a few empirical pieces, Johnson et al. (1983) designed a study
to assess the relations of scores on standardized psychometric tests of personality
and cognition with the educational and occupational levels attained by a group
of middle-aged males and females. Along with sex differences, possible ethnic
differences in the relative influence of background, ability, and personality were
examined by comparing results obtained from Americans of European ancestry
(AEA) to those obtained from Americans of Japanese ancestry (AJA).


More than 1,800 families consisting of two biological parents and one or
more offspring over 13 years of age were tested on a battery of 15 cognitive tests.
Respondents provided information regarding their own years of education and
their occupations. Respondents also provided information regarding the years
of education of their fathers and mothers and, during later years of testing, provided
information regarding paternal occupations. Various subsets of respondents
were administered personality measures as well. The majority of the subjects
were AEAs, and the minority were AJAs.


The family background indexes were consistently positively correlated with
respondents' educational attainment. Cognitive abilities were positively correlated
with educational attainment, with verbal ability producing the highest correlations.
An Adjective Check List (ACL) scale, Ego Organization, was positively
correlated with educational attainment. Superego Strength declined in importance
for college-aged respondents in predicting school achievement. Internal
Discomfort (neuroticism) was negatively associated with educational attainment.
Intraception, which measures rebelliousness, was positively related to final educational
attainment. The obtained correlations of these variables with educational
attainment were fairly consistent across both ethnicity and sex.


Educational attainment was a strong predictor of occupational attainment.
The correlations of the family background items with occupational attainment
were similar to those found for educational attainment and were consistent across
ethnicities, in spite of the AJA respondents' parents coming from a lower socioeconomic
stratum than those of the AEA respondents. The respondents' occupational
status was positively correlated with cognitive ability for both the first
principal component and some of the factor scores. Verbal ability showed the
strongest relation to occupational attainment, as it did to educational attainment.

[p. <i>385</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00396&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For verbal ability and the first principal component, the AJA correlation with
occupational attainment was. 15 to .20 higher than the same-sex AEA correlation.
A respondent's father's occupational status did have an influence on the educational
and occupational status of his adult children, although it was not as strong
as is usually assumed. Associations did exist between family background and cognition
and personality measures. Educational attainment remained a strong predictor
of occupational attainment over and above the effect of family background
and cognitive ability. In many cases, the correlations were actually higher for the
AJA group than for the AEA group (Johnson et al., 1983).


In observing that most Chinese companies are started and run by families,
Wong (1985) described a model of the family firm. According to Wong, prototypically,
the father-entrepreneur is the founder of the business, which centralizes
decision making and cuts down on the delegation of responsibility to subordinates.
The father-entrepreneur is a busy man carrying the entire business on his
shoulders. The father's children all will share the business evenly when the father
leaves, weakening the business's power and centralization. There often is a tug-
of-war between the father-entrepreneur and the sons-inheritors until fate intervenes
by removing the former. The father often does not want to retire in fear
of losing face or having the company fail.


It is clear that once the sons take over the business, the consensus among
brothers cannot be taken for granted. The power of the new chief executive is
greatly curtailed. He no longer enjoys his predecessor's flexibility in reinvestment
and transferring funds laterally. Thus, the characteristic features of this phase are
the outward expansion of the enterprise owing to segmentation and a reduction
in the flexibility for reinvestment and risk taking.


Although relationships among Chinese brothers doubtlessly are brittle, the
most fragile family bonds are to be found among first cousins if they remain in
the same <i>jia</i> (Chinese family). The family business will either stay strong or be
run into the ground by uncaring owners. The durability of the Chinese family
firm is, of course, a relative matter. Compared to its Japanese equivalent, it would
appear to be transitory. Because the Japanese practice primogeniture in the sense
that only one male heir is chosen for succession, it is easier for the ownership
and management of the family estate to remain intact. There are bound to be
many external factors that would alter these cycles. However, the Chinese family
firm, if left on its own, tends to evolve from the father-entrepreneur to his sons,
with the sons eventually losing power. In describing the dynamics of the Chinese
family firm, Wong (1985) pointed out the potential impact of family and cultural
variables' interactions on the career behavior of some Chinese families.


<b><i>Occupational Stereotyping</i></b>


Although it has been known for a long time that Asian Americans often are
the victims of occupational stereotyping, virtually no empirical study of this phenomenon
had been undertaken until that of Leong and Hayes (1990). The purpose
of their study was to determine empirically (a) whether occupational

[p. <i>386</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00397&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The questionnaire consisted of two parts. First, it gave a profile of a high
school senior, alternating in description only between male and female and between
White and Oriental. Because the questionnaires were identical in every
way except race and gender of the profile, it was assumed that any differences
in rating would be the result of stereotyping by race and sex. The second part of
the questionnaire asked participants to rate, on a scale of 1 to 7, (a) how well
qualified the student was to seek <i>training</i> in certain occupations, (b) the probability
of <i>success</i> in 16 different occupations, and (c) how likely the individual
was to be <i>accepted</i> by his or her coworkers in those occupations.


For the dimension of "qualified to seek training," only the main effect for
gender was significant. Women were seen as less qualified to seek training as
engineers, economists, and police officers but as more qualified to seek training
as secretaries. For the dimension of "probability of success," both the race and
gender main effects were significant, whereas the interaction was not. Significant
gender stereotyping differences also were found for secretary and police officer.
Also, women were rated as more likely to be successful as elementary school
teachers and less likely to be successful as computer scientists. Asians were seen
as being less likely to succeed in insurance sales but more likely to be successful
as engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians as compared to Whites.
For the dimension of "likely to be accepted," neither the main effects nor the
interaction was significant.


Asian American students were perceived as being less likely to be successful
as insurance salespersons. They were rated more likely to be successful as engineers,
computer scientists, and mathematicians. The lack of significant race by
gender interactions seems to suggest that gender stereotyping by occupations
might operate for both Whites and Asian Americans.


Occupational stereotyping by gender and race continues to exist despite the
increasing sophistication among the public about the social undesirability of prejudicial
attitudes. Further research is needed to determine how widespread these
occupational stereotypes are before accepting the generalizability of the current
findings. Future research also is needed to assess the psychological impact of
these occupational stereotypes on Asian Americans and to study both internal
and external barriers.


<b><i>Occupational Discrimination</i></b>


The myth that Asian Americans are a successful minority has been well documented
and discussed within the social science literature (Endo, 1974; Kim, 1973;
Lan, 1976; Leong, 1985; Okimoto, 1974; Owan, 1975; Schmid &amp; Nobbe, 1965;
Sue &amp; Kitano, 1973; Suzuki, 1977). Many have questioned the myth, arguing

[p. <i>387</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00398&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The successful minority myth has arisen from the documentation of achievements
Asian Americans have made in the United States. They have been portrayed
as overcoming injustice and setbacks to become one of the most upwardly mobile
minority groups in the country (Peterson, 1966, 1971). These findings would
lead one to believe that Asian Americans had successfully assimilated into American
culture and, therefore, would not experience discriminatory barriers to their
success. Reference to their higher levels of educational attainment often is used
as evidence of this successful assimilation. In addition, traditional Asian cultures
often have emphasized the importance of educational performance in achieving
success in society.


Leong and Raote (1992) used some national data sets to challenge both the
successful minority myth and the economic uniformity myth regarding Chinese
Americans. The successful minority myth maintains that Asian Americans have
been able to use their own resources to achieve high levels of educational and
occupational attainment relative to other minority groups. The economic uniformity
myth consists of Asian Americans' assumption that economic returns
from investment in education are uniformly consistent across all groups within
the United States. Put differently, it is the assumption that there is a positive correlation
between education and income and that the degree of this correlation is
equal among different racial/ethnic groups. As Siegel (1965) pointed out, this
assumption did not apply in regard to "Negroes" back in the early 1960s. Everything
else being equal, Negroes paid a price for being Black. More specifically,
Siegel found that it cost Negroes approximately $1,000 for being Black. A 1970
update of the Siegel study found that Black Americans still paid a price for being
Black and that the cost had increased from $1,000 in 1965, or $1,380 in 1969
dollars, to $1,647 in 1970, an increase of $267 (Johnson &amp; Sell, 1976). In Leong
and Raote's (1992) study, a national data set was used to demonstrate the cost
of being a Chinese American as well as that of being Black.


The specific results of Leong and Raote's (1992) study were obtained from
two reports. Primary data for this study came from a single national data set called
the Survey of Income and Education (SIE), which was collected in 1976 (U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights, 1978). The second source of the data was a report
based on the SIE data set conducted by Hirschman and Wong (1981), who compared
the socioeconomic achievements among foreign-born Asian Americans.


The SIE, being a large national data set, not only was based on a representative
sample but also had a sufficient number of Asian Americans to provide data for
the study. Much of the federal statistical system does not collect such information,
and if such information is collected, data on Asian Americans are not published.
The few data sets that do publish data on Asian Americans will lump Asians (e.g.,

[p. <i>388</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00399&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Leong and Raote (1992) pointed out that, when viewed in isolation, both
the educational attainment data and the occupational status data in the SIE data
set present a rather positive picture of the Chinese American. With a relatively
high level of education and occupational prestige value of their occupations, one
can readily understand how Chinese Americans can be viewed as a successful
minority. However, a close examination of data would reveal that this is not really
true. To reveal the occupational discrimination against Chinese Americans, Leong
and Raote examined the adjusted mean earnings of the Chinese, Blacks, and White
Americans with the level of education, occupation prestige, and number of hours/
days worked statistically controlled for with multiple regressions. These analyses
essentially told us what each group made while working in the United States if
everything else was held constant. Everything else being equal, White males made
$11,427, Black males made $9,741, and Chinese males made $8,817. In other
words, it cost Chinese American males $2,610 for being Chinese. For Blacks, the
cost was $1,686.


These figures provide an index of racial income inequity and also challenge
the economic uniformity assumption concerning the education-income correlation.
More specifically, they reveal that Chinese American men are not all that
successful. In fact, with the same level of education, age, and occupational prestige
and the same amount of time worked, Chinese American men lose much more
than do Blacks. This surprisingly high level of inequity for Chinese American
men should warrant not only a reversal of the successful minority myth for this
particular Asian group but also a reevaluation by Chinese Americans of their
underlying assumption of an automatic relationship between levels of educational
attainment and economic success in the United States.


Many Asian American families have used education as a primary means of
attaining upward mobility within American society. Although these families and
their children, through their conscientiousness and persistence, have achieved a
considerable amount of "success" in educational and occupational attainment,
they have been unknowingly discriminated against by the American economic
and occupational systems for a long time. A recognition and redress of this "hidden
cost" for being Chinese American is long overdue. However, these families
first need to be educated about the disparity within the economic system and
informed that the "educational route" by itself is insufficient and that a parallel
"political route" also is necessary if they are to succeed within American society.
As Chun (1980) pointed out, the concept that Asian Americans are a successful
or model minority often has covered up the occupational constraints and inequities
experienced by Asian Americans.

[p. <i>389</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00400&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Evidence that Asian Americans might have higher academic competencies
and yet be paid less than White Americans comes from another national data set.
The National Science Foundation (1990) found that "the self-reported grades of
Asian freshmen were substantially higher than those of Whites in 1987. While
almost half of Asians gave their grade point averages in the "A" range, the proportion
for Whites was less than one-third" (p. 43). Furthermore, the same report
revealed that Asian American psychologists earn only 66% of what White American
psychologists earn, even though the entry-level degree for both groups is the
doctorate (National Science Foundation, 1990).


There also is some evidence of occupational discrimination against Asian
American scientists and engineers within our universities. A recent National Science
Foundation (1990) report revealed that
<blockquote>
<p>
the tenure status and academic rank of Asian scientists and engineers also differ
from those of Whites. Among doctoral scientists and engineers in 4-year colleges
and universities, Asians are less likely than Whites to hold tenure: in 1987,
roughly 43 percent of Asians, compared with 57 percent of Whites, held tenure.
A higher proportion of Asians (12 percent) than Whites (9 percent) were in
non-tenure-track positions.... Asians and Whites also show some differences
in measures of academic rank. In 1987, 36 percent of Asians and 42 percent of
Whites were full professors; at the associate level, the fraction was 22 percent
for Asians and 24 percent for Whites, (p. 31)
</p>
</blockquote>
It is important to note that these disparities exist despite the fact that Asian
Americans enter colleges and universities with much higher academic credentials
(course grades and SAT/Graduate Record Examination scores) than those
of White Americans.

in measures of academic rank. In 1987, 36 percent of Asians and 42 percent of
Whites were full professors; at the associate level, the fraction was 22 percent
for Asians and 24 percent for Whites, (p. 31)


In the recent publication of <i>Projections of Education Statistics to 2002</i> of
the U.S. Department of Education, it was estimated that Asian Americans would
continue to invest in higher education; the expected increase in college education
of Asian Americans was predicted to increase by 38% by the year 2002. Until
and unless these families and policymakers recognize the economic uniformity
myth that masks these "hidden costs," the system will continue to pay Asian
Americans, particularly Chinese Americans, less money than it pays other Americans
for the same work with the same training. It would be useful to determine
to what extent these Chinese American families, the general public, policymakers,
and social scientists are aware of this cost.


Despite the preceding information, in a recent empirical study similar to
Leong and Hayes's (1990) stereotyping study, Carroll, Feren, and Olian (1987)
found no evidence of prejudice against Asian Americans as managers. Respondents
assumed the role of new members of an organization and assessed their
attraction to a scripted manager in terms of general personal reactions (e.g.,
liking as a person or as a colleague) and as a potential mentor. The sample
consisted of individuals who themselves were about to enter organizations in
junior capacities and could relate to the issues of interest. Complete data were

[p. <i>390</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00401&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The scripts described a newly hired manager interacting with a subordinate.
The meeting included an attempt on the part of the manager to get acquainted
with his subordinate, an engineer who had wanted the job ultimately obtained
by the manager. Both the manager and subordinate were male. Each script contained
4.0 to 4.5 typed, double-spaced pages. The three scripts were created to
reflect differences in the manager's interpersonal competence along the following
dimensions: structuring and controlling the interaction, establishing rapport, reacting
to stress, resolving conflict, developing the subordinate, and motivating
the subordinate. The scripted manager was given the name Cesar Rodriguez (Hispanic),
Ho Chen (Asian), or Dick Baxter (Anglo-Saxon) equally often across the
three interpersonal competency levels. Otherwise, all of the information in the
scripts was identical. In responding to the questionnaire, individuals were instructed
to consider the individual portrayed in the script as their potential mentor
and to assume the role of a young manager employed by the same company. This
study provided no evidence of bias against Hispanic or Asian scripted managers.
In fact, it was indicated that women preferred non-Anglo-Saxon managers as
mentors. The study indicated that personal liking and acceptance of an Asian or
a Hispanic manager as a work colleague, boss, and mentor is primarily related
to the manager's interpersonal competence. The study also provided evidence
showing that women were more sensitive in their reactions to the manager's
interpersonal competence than were men because women typically responded
more extremely to manifestations of the manager's high and low interpersonal
competence. Further research would have to resolve the conflicting findings and
examine the relationship between bias and actual discriminatory behaviors.


<b><i>Occupational Segregation</i></b>


As early as 1972, Sue and Kirk had observed that Asian Americans seem to be
overrepresented in some occupations while being underrepresented in others. Over
the years, more and more data have been accumulated to demonstrate that occupational
segregation is a major problem for Asian Americans as it has been for
women. The notion that occupational segregation is a problem comes from the
assumption that a skewed distribution of any group in the occupational structure
might represent restricted access to certain occupations. At the very least, a pattern
of occupational segregation among a racial/ethnic group would call for investigations
to determine whether there is differential access to various occupations.


In a review article, Chun (1980) noted that occupational segregation was a
prevalent problem among Asian Americans. He cited various studies to show this
pattern of occupational segregation and the tendency for Asian Americans to
avoid the social sciences and humanities and to gravitate toward the biological
and physical sciences. He stated that this segregation probably is a result of the
societal and cultural barriers to Asian Americans' occupational aspirations. In
fact, in a recent national survey (U.S. Commision on Civil Rights, 1978), it was

[p. <i>391</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00402&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In another article, Sue and Frank (1973) explained this occupational segregation
in terms of Asian Americans' ethnic identity and cultural background,
which emphasizes reserve and formality in interpersonal relations, restraint and
inhibition of strong feelings, and obedience to authority. Hence, this pattern of
social anxiety and occupational segregation has important consequences for Asian
Americans not only in terms of the lack of access to certain professionals (e.g.,
lawyers, psychologists, social workers) from their own culture but also in terms
of the internal and external occupational stereotypes that might develop and
result in additional occupational barriers.


The problem of occupational segregation has been investigated by social scientists
for many decades. Much of this research has focused on occupational
segregation, namely the pattern of women being overrepresented in some occupational
fields (i.e., segregating into those occupations) and being underrepresented
in other fields (i.e., segregating out of those fields). More recently, some
attention has been shifted to the pattern of occupational segregation among minorities.
For example, Arbona (1989) examined the occupational trends among
Hispanics in the U.S. labor force by using the 1980 census data and the Holland
Typology of Work. She was able to demonstrate that the Hispanic groups tend
to segregate into certain Holland types and are overrepresented in some occupations
and underrepresented in others.


A table in Hsia's (1988) book concerning the representation of Asian Americans
in selected occupations using the 1980 census data provides a good illustration
of the overall pattern of occupational segregation among Asian Americans.
The table presents the representation index (or <i>RI</i>) of Asian Americans, which
is derived by dividing the percentage of Asian Americans in a particular occupation
by the percentage of Asian Americans in the total civilian labor force and
multiplying that by 100. The representation index then provides a single numerical
representation of the degree of segregation. For example, Asian Americans
with an <i>RI</i> in a particular occupation of 100 means that they are representative
according to their proportion in the general population. On the other hand, an
<i>RI</i> of 200 means that twice the number of Asians are in that particular occupation
relative to their proportion in the population.


Starting with the occupations in which Asian Americans tend to be most
overrepresented or into which they tend to be heavily segregated, we find that
this oversegregation pattern is represented by several fields. Consistent with Hsia's
(1988) finding that Asian Americans are overrepresented in medical schools, the
occupational group physicians has the highest <i>RI</i> (537). In other words, more
than five times as many Asian Americans are physicians as one would expect
given their representation in the general U.S. population. The other occupations
into which Asians are highly segregated include medical scientists with an <i>RI</i> of
372, physicists and astronomers with an <i>RI</i> of 357, biological and life scientists
with an <i>RI</i> of 316, engineers with an <i>RI</i> of 293, architects with an <i>RI</i> of 251, and
accountants and auditors with an <i>RI</i> of 202.

[p. <i>392</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00403&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The categories out of which Asian Americans are segregated or underrepresented
include lawyers with an <i>RI</i> of 41, judges with an <i>RI</i> of 35, and chief executive
officers and general administrators with an RI of 60. It is interesting to
note that this pattern of occupational segregation among Asian Americans parallels
the stereotyping literature, namely that Asians are stereotyped as being more
qualified to enter the physical, biological, and medical sciences and are less qualified
to enter or be successful in the verbal, persuasive, social careers such as being
a lawyer, judge, or teacher. Hence, there seems to be some numerical basis for
which Americans are stereotyping Asian Americans.


More recent data from the National Science Foundation (1990) continue to
document this problem of occupational segregation among Asian Americans:
<blockquote>
<p>
Since 1978, employment of Asian scientists and engineers has increased faster
than has employment of Whites: 146 percent (9 percent per year) versus 97
percent (7 percent per year). In 1988, the approximately 268,000 Asian
scientists and engineers accounted for about 5 percent of the total S/E [science
and engineering] workforce. In contrast, Asians represent only about 2 percent
of the overall U.S. workforce....Asians are somewhat more likely than Whites
to be engineers rather than scientists. Among scientists, Asians are most likely
to be computer specialists and least likely to be environmental scientists. The
index of dissimilarity between Asians and Whites was 16 in 1988; that is, 16
percent of Asians would have to change fields to have a distribution similar to
that for Whites.... Of the Ph.D. Asian scientists, more than three-fifths were
either life or physical scientists, (p. 30)

One consequence of occupational segregation is that Asian Americans, like
women, might be segregated into lower-paying occupations and denied access
to higher-paying jobs. The same National Science Foundation (1990) report also
noted that "Asians are less likely than Whites to be in management. About 28
percent of Whites—but only 22 percent of Asians—reported management as their
major work activity" (p. 30). This pattern of segregation in career paths of Asian
Americans in science and engineering is important because it is most commonly
through rising into the administrative ranks that individuals are able to advance
their careers in terms of both salary and prestige. Are Asian American bench
scientists being passed over for promotion to science director positions for less
qualified White bench scientists due to the former group's lack of social and
managerial skills?


<b>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</b>


<b><i>Current Status of Career and
Vocational Research on Asian Americans</i></b>


As indicated by this review of the literature on the career development and
vocational behavior of Asian Americans, this research area is plagued by several

[p. <i>393</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00404&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Third, the limited research that does exist seems to be more problem driven
than theory driven. For example, there are many more studies about the work
adjustment problems of Asian Americans than about their career development
processes and outcomes from a theoretical point of view. There is no question
that problem-driven research is needed and has its value. Take the example of
studies related to the work adjustment of Southeast Asian refugees. These studies
clearly were in response to the large influx of this group of Asians into the United
States. Yet many of these studies were primarily descriptive in cataloging the problems
experienced by this refugee group. What also is needed are studies that add
to our theoretical knowledge base. For example, are there predictable cycles in
the work adjustment of recent refugees and how the various Southeast Asian
groups fit this modal path? If not, what cultural variables can account for their
deviations? There are many established career theories (Brown &amp; Brooks, 1990)
that can be tested for their relevance to Asian Americans, yet they often are ignored
(Leong &amp; Serafica, 1995).


Finally, like much of the rest of the field of ethnic minority psychology, studies
of the career development of Asian Americans still are stuck at the descriptive
level. Most of the studies are based on the examination of ethnicity as a demographic
variable and not a psychological one. The former approach is characterized
by studies that tend to examine a specific ethnic group's experience (e.g.,
What is the level of job-interviewing skills of Vietnamese refugees?) or seek to
compare two groups based solely on ethnic designation (e.g., Are Chinese American
engineers more job satisfied than White American engineers?). What is needed
are studies that examine psychological variables that might be related to these
ethnic groups' behaviors. For example, how does Berry's acculuration model
relate to the type of work adjustment problems experienced by the Vietnamese?
Or, does Rokeach's system of values moderate whether Japanese Americans are
congruent in their measured and expressed career choices? Can Bogardus's social
distance model account for a significant portion of the variance for the occupational
discrimination of Asian Americans?


Ethnicity per se is not a psychological variable and in the long run will yield
very little information about the career behavior of Asian Americans. What is
needed are studies that identify, evaluate, and test the role and impact of various
culturally based psychological variables that are believed to influence the work
behavior and career development of Asian Americans.

<b><i>Directions for Future Research</i></b>


The first observation concerning research on the career development and
vocational behavior of Asian Americans is that despite the fact that work constitutes
a major portion of the activity of Asian Americans as with all other populations,
surprisingly little empirical research has been conducted on this particular
topic with Asian Americans. Hence, there is a desperate need for more systematic
empirical studies of the career and vocational experience and problems encountered
by Asian Americans.


In terms of the existing studies, there are several methodological issues that will
need to be addressed to improve our knowledge based on the career behavior of
Asian Americans. The first of these is to attempt, wherever possible, to collect data
on the career behavior of Asian Americans such that data are available from subgroups
so that we can examine whether the same pattern of findings is true for
Chinese Americans versus Korean Americans versus Filipino or Japanese Americans.


Currently, most of the research is focused on Asian Americans as a global
group with very little attention paid to intra- or subgroup differences. Worse still,
many of the data collected from the federal statistical system use the combined
group of APIs that include the Eastern Asian groups such as Chinese, Japanese,
Koreans, and Filipinos and then combine them with the Pacific Islanders, who
are from a totally different culture including Samoans, Hawaiians, and so on.
One possibility would be to mirror what has been done in the U.S. census since
1980, which is to encourage federal, state, and local statistical systems to collect
data not only on the Asian subgroup but also on the specific groups such that,
as in the 1980 census, a person indicates whether he or she is Asian or Pacific
Islander and then also designates his or her subgroup. This provides a more refined
level of analysis, and as we do that particular level of subgroup identification,
much more of our research and statistical data will be meaningful.


A second area for future research is with regard to testing the models of
career development that have been developed on White Americans to see whether
they are culturally valid for Asian American subgroups and, if not, what modifications
are needed for them to be culturally relevant and culturally appropriate in
terms of career interventions for this particular minority group (Leong &amp; Brown,
1995). As a part of translating or modifying and adapting these models for Asian
Americans, one important advance that will need to take place is that of evaluating
the validity of various career assessment instruments for Asian Americans. For example,
very litde validity research has been done to determine whether Holland's
classification system, as represented in the Vocational Preference Inventory, the
Self-Directed Search, or even the Strong-Interest Inventory, is appropriate for
Asian Americans as a group. We need to know whether the interest patterns that
we get from interest profiles as well as career decision scales, career maturity
measures, and so on indicate whether these scales are appropriate to be used for
Asian Americans. We certainly need more research on both the instruments and
the process of career assessment with Asian Americans (Leong &amp; Leung, 1994).

[p. <i>395</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00406&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A third major dimension for future research in the career behavior of Asian
Americans is to include two important moderating variables. The first of these
is acculturation or ethnic identity (Leong &Chou;, 1994). There is now substantive
research to show that Asian Americans, either as an entire group or as subgroups,
experience this temporal variable, which includes a process of acculturation that
then differentiates these subgroups; namely, highly acculturated Chinese Americans
might not be the same as low-acculturation Chinese Americans in terms of
their occupational aspirations, interests, choices, and behaviors. Hence, future
research on the career behavior of Asian Americans will have to take into account
this moderating effect of acculturation or of ethnic identity so that traditional
high ethnic identity Japanese Americans may be different from low ethnic identity
assimilated Japanese Americans. The latter group might be more likely to go into
law or politics, whereas the former group might choose a different set of occupations
and socialize their children differently.


The second variable that is an important moderator for future research on
Asian American career behavior also is important for all minority research, and
that is social economic status. We are in desperate need of research that separates
out the effects of social economic status from racial/ethnic minority group status.
For Asian Americans, as with many of the racial/ethnic minority groups in the
United States, the two often are highly confounded. We do not know to what
extent the career patterns are due to the fact that Asian Americans might be from
lower working classes or to the fact that they are from a distinct cultural group,
namely Asians in the United States. To achieve this purpose of identifying the
effects of these two moderating variables, we are in need of instruments that also
will accurately and reliably measure their effects. For acculturation, there already
are available instruments such as the SL-ASIA and the more recent work of Phinney
(1992) in terms of the multigroup ethnic identity measure. Unfortunately, we do
not have a short, reliable, practical social class measure that we can use in our
research, and that certainly is one area in need of further exploration. It would
be very valuable if we could develop a short, highly reliable, useful social class
measure for various racial/ethnic minority groups that could be used across various
studies and across various groups to provide comparable data on this very
important moderated variable.


As the numbers of Asian Americans continue to increase in the United States,
the need for solid empirical data to guide career assessment and interventions
with this fastest-growing ethnic minority group also will increase. In one sense,
this chapter is as much a call for more research on the career development of
Asian Americans as it is a review of the state of the art.
