TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:
_____________________________________________________________________________
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
PATIENT: Because I know seven years ago my father was in therapy with the same program?
COUNSELOR: Yes.
PATIENT: And she said she didn't even notice the camera.
COUNSELOR: Is this the room she was in?
PATIENT: No, because this camera is [inaudible0:00:22]
COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's a thing we can talk about for sure. It is very gruesome, right. So, here we are. Let me tell you a bit to get us started. What I like to do in the first session, it's a 45 minute session, is just I'd like to get to know you, and then in the end I'll take about ten minutes to tell you about myself and about the therapy. What you can sort of expect from these sessions. So why don't you start by telling me...
PATIENT: Any pointed questions or?
COUNSELOR: Let me say that I read over the things you filled out. I read over all the clinically relevant things. All the things that are relevant to therapy. Which is probably... I didn't... I'm not quite sure which forms you filled out in the beginning.
PATIENT: I filled out two pretty big questionnaires. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I probably read one of them. And the forms that you fill out at the end of each session and at mid-phase and the end, and six months later.
PATIENT: OK.
COUNSELOR: So I know what you've written. But I want to hear it from you as well.
PATIENT: OK.
COUNSELOR: So what brings you in?
PATIENT: All right. I feel depressed. Ha ha. I think that I have probably been depressed since I got back from Columbia the first time I was there.
COUNSELOR: You've been there twice.
PATIENT: I've been there twice. I did my last semester abroad in Columbia and I got back from that about three and a half years ago. And I came back and I think at that point I started to feel depressed. I didn't quite know if I wanted to be in Chicago, or if I wanted to go somewhere else. I didn't know if maybe I would be happier in San Diego. [0:02:19]
COUNSELOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Those sorts of issues. And then I was always looking to leave again. So I went to South America, which I was planning, on doing since I came back anyway, because I wanted to do more extensive traveling. I was just basically focused on Columbia the first time. And then I went to... I feel kind of funny. I'm just like, "I don't know what I'm talking about."
COUNSELOR: It feels funny to just launch in to it?
PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. 
COUNSELOR: Do you want to say a little more about what is funny?
PATIENT: I don't know, I just feel funny. [giggles] I'm just nervous, because I've been in therapy before but it has always been with the same therapist. That I've had since I was fifteen years old. So on and off I've been in therapy with her so it is just a whole different experience. I mean I've been in therapy but just with...
COUNSELOR: With the same person.
PATIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: What made you decide not to go? Or what made you not choose the same person again?
PATIENT: I just felt like I need to break from the past a little bit and move on. Because he knows me and he knows my family, my mother had been in therapy with him. I felt like it would be a good thing. Plus the last time I was in therapy with him and it was about fifteen sessions and I just didn't find them helpful. And my mother had been in this program and she told me that it was really good for her so...
COUNSELOR: OK. 
PATIENT: All right. Let me get back to Columbia.
COUNSELOR: Well let me say as we... I'm curious about when you feel funny saying things. And probably for the next three sessions I'll be curious about how you feel as you say things. I think it is important to be aware of those things. Or it is very helpful for you to be as aware as possible. But that is by way of explaining a bit of the therapy.
PATIENT: Yeah, it was just like I started talking and I went, "Oh, here I went to Columbia."
COUNSELOR: Felt kind of light.
PATIENT: Yes. So I took another trip... Not that I should go to my mother's died of cancer and this has been an issue with me for the past five years...
COUNSELOR: But that's there too. [0:04:40]
PATIENT: That's there too. There are a lot of things that are there. Probably my relationships with people. My relationship with my best friend, who has been my best friend since junior high, there's definitely some issues there I'd like to get into.
COUNSELOR: What's her name again? I remember you...
PATIENT: Samantha, Sam.
COUNSELOR: Samantha. 
PATIENT: And Sam just got married when she was in Columbia. We were together in Columbia, we went there together and I left probably about three months ago. And she got married in my last month. And so she's down there. And that probably there is some issues with my father that I would like to get into. I have a great relationship with my father, but sometimes... My parents were divorced when I was about eight years old and sometimes I feel like it is too much and I feel- I don't want to do anything that could possibly disappoint her. 
At times I've felt like I've sort of been a replacement of a spouse for him, and he's very sometimes on top of me. He doesn't have anyone to discuss things with; he doesn't have a partner to discuss things problems with. Anything going on with my brother or I so he's just very... [0:05:51]
COUNSELOR: On top of you.
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes I feel like he's very on top of me. And then if he's with a girlfriend and women that I definitely have a problem with relationships with men. I don't feel very comfortable around men. A lot of times. A lot of times. 
Then most recently I had a boyfriend who was a really good friend of mine the first time I was in Columbia and then we became involved the second time. And I started a relationship with him a couple of months before I left Columbia and the reason why I left Columbia because it didn't work out. It wasn't like we were fighting all the time and it wasn't going to work out, it was kind of like we got together in a really rational way and then we had a fifteen minute discussion, "My idea of a relationship is a little bit different, I'm going to go back to the United States." And he's like, "Alright, bye. Maybe I'll come to the United States, too and maybe I can be different there."
COUNSELOR: That seems sort of cut and dry. 
PATIENT: Cut and dry, yeah. It has been three months and he hasn't written to me at all. 
COUNSELOR: Oh. How does that feel? 
PATIENT: It hurts.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. OK. So when you left there was some, so... you can feel that sadness right now. What is the hurt? 
PATIENT: [Inaudible 0:07:34] My father hates him right now so he doesn't want to hear anything good about him, so I can't talk anything good about him around him. Because when I came back I was pregnant and I had an abortion. And he's just angry at him because, he, you know, one of his old girlfriends had a couple of abortions in the past and she thinks it was really irresponsible of him and he realizes I played a part in it, but he's very, very angry with him. So I can't really discuss it with him unless I'm ready to be angry with him and just say horrible things about him, and he prefers to hear that but...
COUNSELOR: So you're only allowed to have half of the discussion with him.
PATIENT: Yes, because if- My friend Mary who became a very good friend of mine when we came to Columbia the first time is also a very good friend of this person and she, a couple of nights ago I'm on the phone with her and she said, "Well, I can imagine that your father would be very angry, but just remember that you know, I would hate him too, and I would be very angry with him too, but I know him and I know he's a very good person or whatever." I tried to tell my father that and he said, "Oh, he's a good person? Oh gosh, blah blah blah..." So you can't really say anything good about him around him. [0:09:00]
COUNSELOR: Yes.
PATIENT: It was just very hurtful, because when I left it was kind of like, he's more of a person that it is hard for him to share things. And he'd turn on the TV and he'd tune me out a lot of times. And when I was upset about something it was kind of like, "All right, what else?" kind of thing.
COUNSELOR: Meaning that he didn't really want to hear what you were saying, he was sort of like, "just get through this."
PATIENT: Yes, he worked all day long and then he came home and we'd have dinner. And then we'd talk for a while and then he would watch TV. And this one particular night I was expecting my friends to visit me, because I was originally living elsewhere and then I moved in to be with him. I lived with him for probably only a month and a half before I left.
COUNSELOR: What's his name?
PATIENT: Carlos. So this particular night, or this weekend, I was expecting my friends to come visit me. I was pretty alone accept for him, because I'd never been in this town, all my friends were in a different place, and it was just basically him that I had there and that's why I was there. And my friends didn't arrive and they hadn't called, so I didn't know what was going on and so I tried to call one of them, Sam. I tried to call Samantha. And the woman that answered the phone three times said that she was going to try to get her and then there were seven to ten minutes of silence and she wouldn't come back to the phone. So I hung up and would try again. 
COUNSELOR: You were feeling very alone and you were reaching out...
PATIENT: I was alone and I was trying to reach her and I couldn't. This woman was being very uncooperative and wasn't helping. So I went back into the bedroom and he was watching TV and I started to go off. "Oh my God, this woman!" and blah blah blah. "Want to reach Sam and I can't." And he was like, "Mmm," and kept watching TV. So I went back into the living room and I was very upset and that was the first night I slept in another room. I took a nap in the living room then I went back to bed. He was sleeping and he was snoring so I went into the farther room. I got on the phone with Samantha and I was able to talk to her. [0:11:34]
When I got off the phone with her I was upset and I was crying and he came in and he asked what was wrong and we talked about it. I was just like, "you know, I can't talk to you. You're watching TV." He's not a person, and he explained all this, he's not a person to share what's going on inside of him, and he feels uncomfortable when people share too much what's going on with that. He had also talked about how he...
COUNSELOR: And what is going on for you during that? How did you feel... you said you got angry at one point, and you left the room? Were you aware of any other feelings? During that? Was a lot of anger?
PATIENT: Yes, well I was pissed off with him because what had happened earlier. Basically he had just fazed me out and I left. When I came back in the room he was sleeping and I was just sort of, I was still pissed off with him and I didn't want to sleep next to him probably. I mean, he snores every night, but this night it bothered me. So I just left. That was that, I was just pissed up because of what earlier had happened.
And then, he had... He's such a big story, just how we got together and his whole person. So that is definitely an issue. 
COUNSELOR: An issue. Mmhmm. Where you felt very sad for a couple moments there and then you seems to me, sort of talked your way out of it? How did you do that? How did you stop being sad? You're aware something happened to you. Are you aware of feeling any sadness now?
PATIENT: Yes. Now I feel a little sad. Yes.
COUNSELOR: Was that when I brought it up or just throughout when you were talking?
PATIENT: Well, throughout. I just forgot it while I was talking. I was just kind of like on a rampage.
COUNSELOR: It is interesting you seemed to kind of really touch something, and then ways you were talking, you kind of got yourself more together. Not that you weren't... You were thinking about it more.
PATIENT: That's a little bit of Carlos. Everyday I think about him on the train back to Glencoe Park, "there's going to be a letter there."
COUNSELOR: So there's this hope still. 
PATIENT: Yes. Definitely. When I left, he said he was going to come in October and we were going to spend the month together in October, and if he feels like he wants to change, he feels like he could change in the United States. Because maybe the tables would be turned, like maybe he would be more likely to be more open if he was here, because he would be more needing of it. Whereas there I was more alone and needy. And he thought- by the end it seemed like that was what he wanted to do before we left. He was like, "Yeah, I want to change. I want to come in October and spend the month with you and by the end of my work contract, if I felt comfortable in the United States I would come back." [0:15:36]
COUNSELOR: Do you want him to come?
PATIENT: I don't know if I want him to come now. I don't know if I want to open that book again, maybe I need to just close it. But if he came, it could be a way of closing it, but I don't know if that would be a lot more difficult for me. Because I don't think it would work at this point. I had hopes that it could work, but I don't know if it could work at this point, so I don't know if I want to get involved again. I just have to...
COUNSELOR: Close the book. Yes. That can be painful. 
PATIENT: Yes. 
COUNSELOR: What is it like to say some of this to me? When you're talking about Carlos? What's it feel like to say it to me? Is there a feeling there?
PATIENT: I feel like there's so much. I'm just getting to where I don't feel like I'm on a trail here. 
COUNSELOR: Is that OK?
PATIENT: For now. So what else?
COUNSELOR: Where should we go next? Do you want me to ask you questions?
PATIENT: Sure. That might be easier for me.
COUNSELOR: So when you came back, you moved in with your father? How is that?
PATIENT: That's fine for now. I want to move into the city. But at this point there's no way. I have no friends in Chicago right now. Last year when I came back I lived with my father for about a year. And then I got an apartment in the city with a friend and another person who I know through my father who is a friend. Actually all our fathers went to high school together and one of them I've been close to since I was twelve, on and off we've been friends. And the other one I'd met a couple of times and she was looking for an apartment so the three of us lived together. And now, Isabelle who was a good friend of mine, still is, and her boyfriend Dave who also lived with us, they're in Oregon now, so there's really no one around. So I'm trying to see before I call people from the voice ads, if there's someone who knows someone. [0:18:28]
Last time I was at home for a year it got difficult. I felt frustrated with the situation and I didn't want to be there and I started being nasty with my father. I didn't like that so I came to the city.
COUNSELOR: You started getting nasty meaning?
PATIENT: I started getting irritable, really irritable with my father. I was just like, I get pissy a lot.
COUNSELOR: Can you give me a flavor?
PATIENT: I just kind of, I don't know, just pissy. Just like, he would irritate me. "Get away." So we have a really great relationship and it got a lot better when I left. I was definitely very irritable and that started to eat at him.
COUNSELOR: That seemed easier to kind of be apart, than to have that meanness be a part of the relationship?
PATIENT: Yes. Because it was nothing he was doing. He wasn't doing anything bad. I was just frustrated with the situation and he was the closest person. And so that was it. But...
COUNSELOR: Was he on top of you at that time?
PATIENT: Yeah, he tends to be. Probably. He is very on top of me, especially when I'm not feeling good. He's always around the corner like, "Are you OK? Are you OK?"
COUNSELOR: So it feels like, what? Like some beast of prey about to pounce. It doesn't feel like it is caring sometimes?
COUNSELOR: Well, it feels caring it feels caring. But I feel like sometimes he is just consumed with my life and my brother's life just so much. I mean, you should be a part, a big part of your children's lives, but he's just right there all the time. And he gets so upset. My brother is going through something with his girlfriend that he was living with for two years, and now they're not anymore and he just doesn't like the girl at all. [0:20:43]
Every minute he's talking about, "Oh my God, Dan should do this, Dan should do that, he can't get out of this relationship, he should get a new job, he's suffering over your mother still... He should go back to school." He's always there with something. "But do you think I shouldn't say anything?" And blah blah blah blah blah, but he is always...
COUNSELOR: Kind of there.
PATIENT: Yes. I mean he's wonderful. We have a great relationship, but probably it feels like sometimes just too much.
COUNSELOR: It is a bit much.
PATIENT: Too much. It is just like, "Relax, we're going to make mistakes, but we have to make them." I said to him one point when he had visited me in Peru, which I was actually planning on coming back from Colombia, I kind of went for a loop there, I was planning on coming back from Colombia in May, and at that point I had told my father I was planning on coming back. I had written Carlos a letter because he was living in Bogot�, kind of explaining how I felt about him and wondering because it always felt like there was something mutual with him, and just wondering what was going on with that. Just saying, "You know, this is really driving me nuts, I just feel like I need to express this to you." [0:21:56] 
And so before, probably a couple of days before I was planning on going and I was going to travel in Venezuela and Brazil with my friends Trish and Kelly for a month before I went back to the United States. He came before I was leaving, he probably came a few days before I left on this vacation, and we probably talked about it and then we decided, I pretty much decided that I would go live with him in Bogot�. 
And so when I started off on my trip and called my father on the road and said, "Well, Dad, I'm going to do this." He was nuts. Very, very upset. Just wanted me to come home. "You have to go back to school, your life is in the United States, you have to get back into North American culture, you don't have a future in Colombia, come back, what are you doing down there?" Kind of thing.
So he came down to Peru to meet me. And at this point I was saying that I was probably staying, but I wasn't sure. And so he came to Peru...
COUNSELOR: Was part of that him; was he sort of persuading you a bit?
PATIENT: Yes. I didn't want to say it. He played... at that point I probably knew what I was going to do and what I wanted to do, go back to Colombia. But at that point I didn't want to make the decision because I felt like my father would just be so disappointed in me. 
COUNSELOR: And that's a big thing for you. 
PATIENT: Yes. He said to me over the phone, I told him. He said, "You with all your women's lib stuff and you're going back to Colombia to be with a man!" And I was like, "Whoa!" And I knew he would be... [0:23:28]
COUNSELOR: He was going to kind of pull out her whole arsenal to get you back.
PATIENT: Yes. And so I didn't want to make a decision that I didn't, I probably didn't want to make a decision before I saw him, so that he wouldn't judge me for it, and not think I'm a flake that can't get my life together and I just decided to stay in Colombia for a man. So I probably didn't want to make the decision before I saw him even.
COUNSELOR: So he said, "I'm going to come to Peru to help you decide?"
PATIENT: The first phone call he was pretty much a wreck. I called him back when I got to Brazil, which was about five days later, and he said, "I talked to your uncle and he said, just go down to Peru to talk to her and find out what's going on." He said, "There's a lot that I don't understand and I just want to come down and talk about it." So we met up in Peru, and spent a week together.
COUNSELOR: And how did you feel about your father coming to Peru?
PATIENT: I was happy. I was happy he decided to come.
COUNSELOR: You felt how?
PATIENT: Well, I hadn't seen him in a year or so, so I was happy to see him. And I wanted to explain what was going on with me in person. And I wanted to see what he would say. I wanted his approval and I thought that I could get it more easily if I saw him face to face also.
COUNSELOR: So that was part of it? [0:25:03]
PATIENT: Yeah. I was scared, too. I was like, "You guys, He's coming to Peru to drag me away!" And my friends said, "Don't worry, we're not going to let him take you!" But...
COUNSELOR: So you're kind of describing being a pawn of these other forces. Sort of like your father, and this fear he's going to drag you away and your friends will keep you and Carlos who now at this point wants you to stay.
PATIENT: But he remained pretty neutral. He was kind of like, "This is the way it is, and this is the way I am." Later on he told me he knew I was going to come back to Colombia. But then he was like, "Travel a little while, you don't have to make the decision now, travel a little while, see how you feel, take yourself out of Colombia and see how you feel." And he said to me when I talked to him on the phone in Brazil, "Oh it will be helpful to see your father, you can talk to him and see what he thinks." But he knew I was [inaudible phrase 0:26:13] And I knew it too.
COUNSELOR: So to him this was kind of...
PATIENT: But I just needed to... Like, my father was a major decision in all this. I knew what I wanted to do, but I just had to get by this father thing.
COUNSELOR: Meaning you wanted to get his approval.
PATIENT: I wanted to see what he thought, I wanted to see how bad he would think of me. And probably, I don't know, I mean I probably would have ended up doing the same thing anyway, but I wanted to see. I wanted to get a more clear feeling of what I was going to do, probably.
COUNSELOR: And so he gave her approval?
PATIENT: Pretty much. Well, not approval. At no point did I feel approval. I mean he wasn't like, "Go ahead and do it, that's fine." But he was kind of like, "Go ahead and do it that's fine." After a while. We kind of discussed, and he was kind of like, "Well, you need to do what you're going to do. But this is how I feel about it. I don't think this is right." The other thing he said to me was, I was having a hard time with my best friend Samantha, and after a while he started saying, "Well, I think maybe you think this is a good healing thing for you to do. Go..."
COUNSELOR: Be with Carlos.
PATIENT: "Go be with Carlos, feel appreciated by your peers. I know it is different with your father and with your family is different. But maybe you feel like you need to go with this person and feel appreciated." At that point, he had met Carlos once the first time I was in Colombia, the first time I came to visit. He had met him and from what I told him about him, he had really liked him a lot. He liked him a lot. And he kind of felt, "Oh good, go there, and he's going to give you a lot of attention, he's going to give you a lot of positive feedback. So go. I feel like maybe that's even what you're going for." And he kind of felt like, "Maybe you just need to go and do that." [0:28:20]
COUNSELOR: Yes. 
PATIENT: Because there was a lot of stuff going on with Samantha. I think it was probably a hard time for the four of us. It was Sam, Kelly, Trish and I. And Samantha, Trish and I had traveled to Central America together and Colombia together and things got difficult for each of us in different ways. And then she got involved with this person and I felt pretty abandoned, pretty bad, because I was pretty depressed at that point too. And she wasn't spending a lot of time with me at all; she was just kind of with this guy...
COUNSELOR: With this guy.
PATIENT: With this guy that she got married to, who is a great person, really great person...
COUNSELOR: But he took your best friend, your closest friend away from you. I mean in some ways.
PATIENT: Yes. That was a big issue for me. 
COUNSELOR: And suppose your father hadn't given you approval. I mean, had given. He started off by saying, you said he went nuts. "You need to be here, you're supposedly a feminist and here you are chasing a man around, not in America" he sort of really tried to get you here. Suppose he had stayed that way? What would that have been for you?
PATIENT: Well he did stay that way. He never stopped saying those things. He was definitely, right to the end, "I want you to come home because this is what you need to do, you need to go to school, and you need to get your life together." Whatever. He stuck with that stuff. But then I got a little bit of approval that "Maybe this will be a good thing for you, to be with someone who appreciates you."
COUNSELOR: Suppose he hadn't said that?
PATIENT: I don't know. I probably would have gone to Colombia still.
COUNSELOR: And what would have been the feelings that go with that?
PATIENT: I would have felt horrible.
COUNSELOR: And when you say horrible, what...
PATIENT: I would have felt like I was a big disappointment to my father. Like I was a flake that was running after some guy to South America. 
COUNSELOR: A flake? [0:30:32}
PATIENT: Kind of like a flake maybe, kind of up in the air, think that, well, he did kind of think about what I was doing with my life in South America.
COUNSELOR: Disappointment. 
PATIENT: Yes. I wouldn't say at this point that he thinks it is a Disappointment that I spent a year in South America and didn't do much. I worked, I traveled, I saw a lot. But I'm trying to...
COUNSELOR: You're convincing. You're making the case.
PATIENT: not anything! I did work! 
COUNSELOR: Right. Right. So there's a fear, or I'm imagining there is a fear that someone may be disappointed in you or that you're a little disappointed in yourself. You're sort of justifying it before you're accused. 
PATIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: Yes. And maybe a fear of, am I hearing a fear of disappointing dad generally? Can you just sort of stay with that? What is that about?
PATIENT: I don't know I just need his approval.
COUNSELOR: So you can feel it. You can feel it. It is in your body.
PATIENT: Yes. I really need his approval, it is very, very important to me. I get upset. I can feel it. Like a couple nights ago. I think he's not crazy about my friend Trish at this point.
COUNSELOR: Trish is back in the States? [0:32:14]
PATIENT: Yes, Trish is back in the States. He's not crazy about my friend Trish, and he... Trish called me a couple of nights ago, and my father was already in bed, it was probably 10:30. And I talked to Trish downstairs, and when I came back upstairs I felt like there was something weird in his tone of voice, like he was like, "Are you talking to Trish?" Which isn't really the case and whatever. But I kind of felt like a tone of whatever. 
Before I fell asleep I was like, "Are you angry at me?" Just kind of screaming from my room. He's like, "No! I'm not angry." And that is just kind of like an example I'm just like, "Hold it! Are you disapproving?"
COUNSELOR: Right, you're kind of scanning for it. Yes. And what is the fear there? I mean, this is difficult. I'm trying to get the quality of that fear, a sense of what that is. Like, when you were lying in bed, what were some of the things you were thinking, feeling, imagining?
PATIENT: Just that, "He doesn't approve. He's upset with me."
COUNSELOR: What would be the worst sort of thing you could imagine? As you're lying in bed and you're thinking about Trish and imagining what your father said in that tone of voice, what would be the worst thing you could imagine that he would be thinking?[0:33:46]
PATIENT: What is she doing being friends with this person. I don't know. I can't think of anything too horrible.
COUNSELOR: Something like that.
PATIENT: Something like that, something like, "What is she doing? She doesn't know what she's doing, this person." It is just like, maybe if he doesn't approve than maybe what I'm doing just isn't right. Like I'm bad if my father doesn't approve.
COUNSELOR: That's the feeling.
PATIENT: Sort of. Sort of.
COUNSELOR: Are there better words for it?
PATIENT: Not bad, but not OK. There's something wrong if my father doesn't approve. There's something wrong with me if my father doesn't approve of everything I'm doing at each moment in my life. 
COUNSELOR: So you're...
PATIENT: But he generally does really approve of me.
COUNSELOR: Right. So I can...
PATIENT: [Giggling 0:34:59]
COUNSELOR: What's that?
PATIENT: He does approve of me! No, he does though. I just felt for a second like I was trying to convince you again, but I wasn't.
COUNSELOR: I was aware of that too. I was thinking that too. So there's a part of you that it's important for me to know and for you to say, "Well, generally my father approves of me." It's not like he goes around thinking, I'm a flake that follows Carlos around. That's not...
PATIENT: She doesn't. That's not how she feels. But I'm just like really, I don't know, proving to myself that he was way too important to me.
COUNSELOR: Yes. And I'm imaging- and tell me how this fits, you might be feeling tricky that you most often, or always or whatever, I don't know quite sure most often. Let's say, won his approval and then sometimes feel that he is on top of you. That can be tricky to negotiate I would imagine. I want his approval, maybe he's too much. Or does that not quite fit.
PATIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: I mean, I don't know...
PATIENT: It is a strange combination I guess. 
COUNSELOR: Are they ever intentioned or not really, that kind of, "I want his approval, maybe he is on top of me too much. " Is there a tension between those two things?[0:36:36]
PATIENT: I don't know. I don't really have any thoughts on that particular relationship between those things. 
COUNSELOR: Yes. 
PATIENT: I don't know, I just don't. What a question.
COUNSELOR: Time to get structured again. Well what is it like saying this to me? You said on your questionnaire that it is somewhat difficult for you to speak. You actually said in groups, but you said sometimes to men as well. 
PATIENT: Yes, men. I feel uncomfortable around them.
COUNSELOR: Men.
PATIENT: Men.
COUNSELOR: How is it to say some of this to me?
PATIENT: It is OK. 
COUNSELOR: What is the non-OK part of it? Or it is completely OK?
PATIENT: Yes. It is OK.
COUNSELOR: Hunky Dory.[0:37:31]
PATIENT: Yes. I mean probably, to be honest, which I am embarrassed to say so, I didn't really know what to expect and at first and you called and you were a man, I was like, "Oh God, it is a man." I wanted it to be a woman. And when Trish said to me, "Is it going to be a woman?" Because it is important for her too, in that kind of a situation, we share those feelings. She said, "Did you ask for a woman?" And I said, "No, I didn't ask for a woman because I should probably deal with it if it is a man anyway, if I have such issues with men I should probably just deal with it anyway." So, and I didn't even know if I even wanted a man. I sort of wanted a man and I sort of didn't. So when you came up and I thought, "He's a young, good looking man," and I thought, "Oh no! This is the worst thing." So...
COUNSELOR: So that's a little overwhelming, feel like. 
PATIENT: Yes, but I'm OK with it. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: At first when I was sitting there I thought, "Oh Shit." But now I feel fine.
COUNSELOR: So how did you do that? What do you do to go from kind of overwhelmed to being OK?
PATIENT: You mean like before, the crying and then... I don't know. Why, do you think I go up and down a lot?
COUNSELOR: No. The reason I ask is because you do something. You do something to keep yourself from not going like whatever you experienced when you were out there. And I'm just kind of curious what you do, if there's thought, a way that you feel?
PATIENT: I don't really know.
COUNSELOR: I am sort of groping in the dark right now. I don't have anything in mind. I'm just curious.
PATIENT: I don't know, it is just like initial reactions and then I can just open up and think clearly again.
COUNSELOR: Yes. But I'll keep, I should say a bit about the therapy. I'll keep asking you about your experience of things. Your feeling experience. Not so much, what you're thinking although I'm interested in what you're thinking. But I'll sort of keep checking up your feeling are about things. This is the kind of short-term therapy, which is very focused. And one of the focuses is increasing your awareness of what you're feeling. [0:40:22]
PATIENT: So which of the three techniques are...
COUNSELOR: This. This is the integration. This is an integration of a lot of different therapies. I'm going to give you this, which you can take with you, which is a thing we wrote up which summarizes the way I'll be approaching things. But I'll be asking you to sort of tend to yourself and we'll be working to help you, us, to become more aware of you r experience. And also, what goes on between us. Because, for example, if you feel a lot of anxiety in your life around men, around social situations, I'm a man, this is a kind of social situation, And if we can explore what is going on here, And you can become aware what is going on between here, you can use that awareness out there. So that is kind of where I'll be steering us at times. Any thoughts, any feelings on that?
PATIENT: No, that's good.
COUNSELOR: OK. So you said it was a little embarrassing to say sort of, "Oh, young, good-looking guy, this is going to be a lot." 
PATIENT: Yes. Because that is like... I mean, I'm not a nut case with men, but I'm definitely very nervous around men. I would like to explore my relationship with men as well. Because I don't know, I just have problems with relationships with men.
COUNSELOR: Right. And it sort of feels to me like you're showing me two parts of yourself. Like there's a part of you that is going to freak out a little bit And be like, "Whoa, this makes me very anxious," but there is a part of you that gets yourself together. There is a part of you that somehow by the time you sat down, you were better with it.
PATIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: So we'll see, as you become more aware of it, what that is about. So, where are you at now?
PATIENT: Nowhere. 
COUNSELOR: It is one of those moments when I can ask a question; we have about two minutes, two or three minutes. Do you have any questions? About me, or anything at all?
PATIENT: You said that you were a Psychologist intern.
COUNSELOR: Psychology intern, yes. 
PATIENT: So how many years have you studied?
COUNSELOR: I'm finishing up my PhD, so this is the last year of my PhD training. So around...
PATIENT: Where are you studying?
COUNSELOR: At Loyola University.
PATIENT: I live right near Loyola.
COUNSELOR: I was in Connecticut for four years, doing, that was the graduate part.
PATIENT: OK. And you just got involved with this program?
COUNSELOR: I've been involved with this program all along. So for quite some time I have been seeing patients in it for quite some time, for a couple years. But I am now finishing up the Degree And [inaudible 0:43:54] full time. 
PATIENT: OK. 
COUNSELOR: Anything else? And the camera, how about any concern? Right. It is a little, what is that look.
PATIENT: Yes, it makes me a little nervous.
COUNSELOR: What is the nervousness like?
PATIENT: I don't know. It is like, all of my little mannerisms; all my little body language or whatever is being recorded.
COUNSELOR: So it is like, self-conscious nervousness? Like every little thing I do is...
PATIENT: In the preliminary interviews, I didn't know where to look. Because a lot of times she was reading questions and we wouldn't be having eye contact. So I was like, "Where do I look? Her outfit is nice. Or those are the books, or Hi." That sort of thing. 
COUNSELOR: In cases you could see the camera and feel a little nervous about it. As all things, I'm interested in anything that is going on with you. So increasingly if you're very aware of it, let me know. I've been doing this so long that I tend to forget about it. Tell me if that is a concern. 
PATIENT: I'll get used to it, I'm sure. I just didn't expect it to be in this room. And when my mother told me she wasn't aware of the camera at all, like it was some kind of little thing in the corner hidden somewhere that she wasn't even aware of, I thought that would be the situation. So when I came in here I saw the camera very clearly.
COUNSELOR: That's actually a prop, that's not the real camera. We have the real camera hidden inside the wall. OK, we should wrap up.
PATIENT: The other thing is, that I forgot to bring the money today. 
COUNSELOR: That is OK bringing it next time.
PATIENT: I have about half of it, and I just forgot, I'm sorry. 
COUNSELOR: That's OK bring it next time. So what time did you get here today?
PATIENT: Well today I was in the field so [inaudible 0:46:25]
