BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: All right. Well tell me how everything's going. 
PATIENT: Good. I had, let's see, today's Monday. Sunday I had, again abstinence not broken so everything's going well, but what happened was, I had a meal that was a bit on the bigger side of a moderate portion of lunch. I'm used to, as you know, hanging around the four. Threes to fours trying to get up to the higher range. As you say it's healthy to have the bigger ones. But it kind of stirred up some feelings within myself because it felt like even though it wasn't a binge, it was just more than I was used to having for lunch. So I kind of had some anxiety around it. 
COUNSELOR: Let me ask a couple questions about it. 
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: We're talking about the range of moderate. One to ten. One being low moderate and ten being the high end of the moderate range. 
PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Ten still being moderate. But just ten the high end and one the low end. And you typically eat just slightly but below the mid. And I assume that's a plan. That you're planning the meals. Was the one that was higher planned to be higher? Or was it impulsively changed?
PATIENT: Impulsively changed. 
COUNSELOR: Okay. So that's the part I want you to hear. It is the impulsiveness that opens the door to trouble, even if it stays in the moderate range.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And even if you felt okay about it. Usually kicking that impulsive energy in will start to take it away. It will feel unsettled. It will feel like we aren't really getting the serenity that we want from our planned meals because we've lost the plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So and on top of that then that kind of generic uncomfortableness? You didn't feel comfortable for what reasons are you aware of?
PATIENT: I think it was just an uncomfortable feeling of being full first of all. 
COUNSELOR: Meaning kind of too full?
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of a high moderate.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: High moderate fullness. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Why? What just happened here? That hasn't happened in awhile. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I think maybe because I never really go over that five or six mark. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: To be at an eight or a nine is a big difference for me.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. And that will be for any of us.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I remember the first Thanksgiving that I was abstinent, I planned like a nine. And afterwards feeling the same emotions that went with a binge...meaning self loathing, remorse, guilt...all of that. And that sounds a little bit like what you're talking about, right? 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. So even though I planned a nine, I experienced those feelings. If you throw on top the fact that you ate at the higher end and there was impulsiveness; then that's the most troublesome. Because when you plan it, you can say, "Mm, that didn't work." If it's impulsive, then that guilt and remorse is real, because we acted on the impulsiveness of the addiction. 
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So, if you want to, because eating at threes or fours all the time probably is going to leave you a little depleted. So that's why it's better to move around between threes and sevens.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So that, if you ate, threes, threes, threes, threes. It's not uncommon to impulsively bounce to a nine. And then feel bad about it. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: But you bounce there impulsively... not with  a plan most of the time.
PATIENT: Okay. So maybe just like making sure that I'm a little bit more swaying from both ends of the scale instead of staying to a lower one. 
COUNSELOR: Right. And if you notice that you've had four or five meals in a row that are threes. Then you plan a six. You plan a seven. But not from impulsiveness. So you work with the planning of it. [0:04:14.3]
PATIENT: Okay. 
COUNSELOR: When we make a plan then we have a decision to say whether or not the plan works. Remember I told you, in my first few months, probably somewhere around six months of abstinence, I realized I hadn't had any snack foods. And so I planned a lunch of basically snack foods, but it was a moderate meal. And it had beer nuts and beef jerky and pepperoni sticks. But you know a plate of moderate amount. (Chuckling) And after I ate that I was so unsatisfied, and I thought, "Okay, I've got to wait till dinner. I won't die before dinner, but I'm not doing that again." So I had an option-
PATIENT: To say it didn't work. 
COUNSELOR: To say it didn't work. Same thing when I planned the nine or ten around my first Thanksgiving. And then said, "Eh, nah, too close to the edge. Don't like the feelings that go with it." And then the next Thanksgiving I came up with eating like a six, but then having the same meal, breakfast, lunch and dinner the next day if I want. So I get all the Thanksgiving food I want but I never have to overeat to get it. I just have breakfast, lunch and dinner the next day at a six of the Thanksgiving foods. 
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: So the plan is going to be the one with the most freedom and the impulsiveness is the one that activates the addiction. 
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah because I think that there's definitely the finger foods and things like that, that cause a problem. It was like I had a sandwich and then that was over. And then I had an apple. And then that was over. But then I had a Popsicle. You know what I mean? It was just like instead of having it planned out, it was a little bit more sporadic. 
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And it wasn't by any means as I say, a binge, but it felt that way when you're used to just, you're getting in the groove of things and you're in a constant pattern.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But it was probably similar to eating fours or fives and then having a Thanksgiving dinner and you feel like you've blown it. And then there was a lot of disease chatter saying, "You know what? Just don't eat dinner tonight." 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: So but I did. 
COUNSELOR: Good, good, good, good, good. 
PATIENT: And got back on the horse the next day. (Chuckling) But there was definitely a lot of; well you know that could've been two meals, so why don't you just skip the next one. Have a V8. So, you know. 
COUNSELOR: Well I'm glad you stuck with the three meals, because that's how we get our long term abstinence stable. If you don't, your pattern is to overeat and then under eat by skipping meals. But with you, just because you went to the high moderate, you didn't then throw the abstinence away by skipping the meal. 
PATIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: But the impulsiveness, it is like being in a bar. Impulsiveness is, we're driving up to the bar, we've parked our car, we've walked inside, we're thinking we can order a 7-UP and not have trouble with our drinking, right? That's the analogy. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So impulsiveness is, you know, walking into that bar. So we want to not walk into the bar.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: And I don't know if you noticed at the time, but for most of us, impulsiveness at a meal time, starts that vibrating, anxious energy in our chest and throat.
PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
COUNSELOR: And so that, once we've kicked in that impulsiveness, it puts us at high risk. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So the easiest thing to do is no impulsiveness. And I think I told you, somewhere in my first year I realized that. And that's when I gave myself that secondary bottom line. Which is not the abstinence bottom line, but kind of a recovery bottom line, of no impulsiveness. 
PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
COUNSELOR: And-
PATIENT: It's like that feeling, like it's an excitement, but it's kind of like-
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The nervousness. Yeah. I mean I definitely know as soon as I'm feeling it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Like it's the just the moving through it and things. And that's why with the impulsiveness after it was done, I mean I was able to actually, excuse me, in the middle of it, be like, "Okay what are you doing here?" [0:08:16.6]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Are you really hungry right now? Or like what's going on? And to stop. And to be like okay. But then it was the hours after dealing with the fact that I was telling myself not to have a dinner.
COUNSELOR: Right. 
PATIENT: So-
COUNSELOR: It kind of set up that disease chatter to start that seduction process again.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: To your old pattern.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: Yeah, and it was because I'd had just really steady days. Three meals. Moderate. They were fine. I felt good about them. You know when you just have a really good streak there for awhile? 
COUNSELOR: Right. Right.
PATIENT: It's kind of just anticipating something going wrong. I think that's for me I anticipate because I'm so in the early stages of my abstinence. So I get worried sometimes. But anyways, there was no harm done, it was just kind of on the upper scale of moderate. So I just had to be careful.
COUNSELOR: Hopefully the benefit that you've got from it is kind of the same benefit that I got from my experience which is, I said to myself when I realized, mine was just from picking on the meal. I think I told you I worked with a school district in an early part of my abstinence and we had a staff meeting every lunch hour. So we'd go to the cafeteria, bring our lunch back over to our bungalow and have our staff meeting. And I had my tray in front of me, the moderate range wasn't going to change. But I would start to pick on the green beans or something, and I'd feel the energy kick in. And that's when I realized that it's not simply changing the volume but it is the impulsiveness that also does it. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And I said to myself, "I don't want my recovery to feel like my disease." And that's the chapter title in my book, "Does this feed my disease or does this feed my recovery?" And that was kind of the thing I'm hearing you say. I don't want to do it. I made it through successfully. But I don't want to do it again, and have close calls all the time. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Yeah. I don't want to have that feeling. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well the suggestion I have then to make sure that in your planning, and the key word is the planning, is that you move around in the moderate range a little bit more. 
PATIENT: Okay. And so when you plan a meal, do you plan them, like say would you have tomorrow's meals planned?
COUNSELOR: No. No. 
PATIENT: How do you-
COUNSELOR: But when I was a new, meaning in the first few weeks, like three to six, I would get up in the morning and I would know what's in the kitchen, because I shopped for the family. So I would have one of the breakfasts, but I'd know which one before I ate it obviously. I'd know that I was going to work and I was going to pick one of the cafeteria meals. And I knew what I was going to pick for dinner. I'd take it out of the freezer so that whatever, the protein or whatever needed to be defrosted was out in the refrigerator. So I kind of knew at the beginning of the day what the meals were going to be. And that's a lot, a lot of freedom.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: And it's real necessary when you have a family to have a little planning in there. With myself, because it's been just me and the kids are grown and gone a long time ago, but I shop kind of knowing what I'm bringing in for dinners, what I'm bringing in for lunch, what I'm bringing in for breakfasts. And so when I get up the morning now, I know it's one of the breakfasts. When I stop for my lunch I get one of the lunches. 
And before a bite goes in my mouth I know the totality of it. I know if I'm going to have the open faced sandwich and the carrots and the bell pepper and the handful of cashew nuts. If that's what the meal is I know before a bite goes in my mouth. And that's the long term plan approach. You know? Probably when you're newer; you want a little more details in the planning. But as you get into that second half of your first year, into your second year of abstinence, it's still the plan, I know before a bite goes in my mouth the whole plan. 
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: That's where your freedom's going to be. When you're at a restaurant, you pretty much know what you're ordering. But restaurants again, serve high moderate often times, and sometimes even immoderate obviously. So you know you're going to have to decide how much you are eating of the salmon or whatever. You know that it's going to be a deck a size card of the protein, a cup of the vegetables, you need to know what you're going to eat out of the meal that's being served to you. 
PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
COUNSELOR: So that you take the other part home or you push your plate aside so that a busboy comes and gets it. 
PATIENT: Okay. 
COUNSELOR: So right now are you doing the shopping for your household? 
PATIENT: My mom does. But I go sometimes too. And they're pretty healthy eaters. The only thing that they don't do, is proportion out things. You know what I mean? Like if I'm going to have a cookie, I'll have two and I'll put the box away. (Chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Whereas like they could have a couple and not think about it. Because they don't have the guilt and they don't have the disease.
COUNSELOR: Right. 
PATIENT: Which is fine. And it evens itself out in the end with them. But that's the only real difference with them and myself. But we have, I mean you open up our fridge, it's just like, I think the food guide is represented pretty well in there. Because it's all just like V8 and fruit and vegetables. We have chicken and vegetables every night. Or fish. I mean it's very healthy. 
COUNSELOR: Good. Good. Good.
PATIENT: And those cookies, it's interesting too. I told you last time that it was the little spelt (ph) butter cookies. 
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah. Well I threw those away the second day. (Chuckles)
COUNSELOR: They set up the "let's have it again" chatter?
PATIENT: Yeah. No it was just. It was too much hand to mouth. And even though the portion serving said 14, I didn't even have that. I had six, but then I just found myself thinking about them when they were put away. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I wasn't thinking about other things that were put away when they were away. So. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I just I got rid of them.
COUNSELOR: Good. Well you know with the cookies or picking desserts to bring into the house, you want to make sure that you don't bring in ones that set up the let's have it again, let's have it again, let's have it again chatter. 
PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
COUNSELOR: So there'll be a-
PATIENT: I don't really know if there are too many things that doesn't set up that chatter. 
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But if there's anything I feel like I have to pick up with my hands, it just it's too much right now. I can't even think about it. Ice cream doesn't even give me the same chatter as the hand to mouth things. And even I don't have ice cream in the house.
COUNSELOR: Okay. 
PATIENT: I feel like maybe dessert might be something that I choose to have when I go out. 
COUNSELOR: That's probably the safest and the wisest thing. 
PATIENT: Yeah because there is not a whole lot that I am doing aside from just working this.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And it's like I need to be doing something. So if I'm not doing that then I'm not accomplishing something. So it's more just like getting something accomplished and then it comes down to, "Well I didn't do this, so therefore am I going to gain weight?" Or then I have a little bit of chatter about, "Well tomorrow just do double." But I never do. 
COUNSELOR: Well that's good. Because that definitely-
PATIENT: I kind of say it the day before and then I don't. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well don't. If you can recognize that as the addiction chatter, then that's to your advantage. Because here's the thing, when you went home from treatment your weight went down. The addiction's going to try to figure out how to use that. "Well, you only did it because you cut down your eight, threes and fours and you got to the gym seven times a week. So if you quit doing that your weight going's to go up". Do you know what I'm saying? 
PATIENT: Hmm
COUNSELOR: So we want to be really high alert. Like I knew my weight went down because I was eating three meals a day. I was not, at that time, working out in any way, shape or form. I had small kids. I was going to school. I was working part time. So I had a pretty active life but I wasn't working out. So I knew there wasn't a way the addiction could seduce me with that. With you, the addiction voice can start to sound like reality. And the truth is, it might be reality. You know, my weight might be ten pounds lower if I did the gym the way you're doing the gym. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It might not. But it might. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And so if you quit and go into a more average lifestyle with marriage, family, kids, work and only get to the gym a couple of times a week, then the chance of the addiction trying to seduce you if your weight shifts is high. Like I had a client, she had three or four years of abstinence when she wanted to do the breast cancer walk. 
PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
COUNSELOR: When she started training for the breast cancer walk, she was probably a fairly average weight but not a low moderate body. 
PATIENT: Mmm.
COUNSELOR: You know, kind of a, if we think of moderate weight being a range, she wasn't a one, she wasn't a ten. But she was a six or a seven. And which was fine. She was a 45 year old attractive woman. But when she started training for the breast cancer walk, which is like 3 days of 60 miles so she trained with a group. Her weight went down 14 pounds. And even though she had several years, it really kind of freaked her out. Like how can I keep it here? What can I do? You know?
PATIENT: Walk for 17 miles everyday.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And so she had to understand that doing that was probably going to affect her weight but it didn't have to affect her recovery. So the weight went down during her training period. It went back up when she went back to her regular lifestyle.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: But I do think it introduced her to feeling more fit and feeling the benefits of exercising. And I think she probably included it more regularly. But, the 14 pounds she went down from, that kind of training was not how she lived, she didn't live at a training level. And so in some respects you're living at a training level. As if you're-
PATIENT: Yeah I think I actually am. Yeah. I mean I do exercise a lot. And that's the thing. It's always been such a huge part of my life. I mean I'd love to put it into a career. But I can say that's not appropriate right now. 
COUNSELOR: Right now. Yeah.
PATIENT: So that's-I just want to keep it up. I would much rather be doing something active than anything else. I love camping. I've played every sport under the sun. I just really like it. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: I didn't used to like it for the benefits of weight or anything like that. It became more about that right in the midst of my disease. And it's actually now shifted back to something that I just really realize, even when I don't want to go to the gym sometimes, I go, because of the way that I feel when I get back.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.
PATIENT: Not even having to do with my, "Okay now I'm safe. I won't gain weight." It's that for a person that is depressed, it does help a lot. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah it does help a lot. 
PATIENT: I find that it helps just re-center me. I actually feel like in terms of my abstinence, in terms of being hopeful, after I've finished a session or I'm done there, or had a workout, I feel like, "Okay like I can do this." 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: You know?
COUNSELOR: I know-You mentioned last time that you were thinking about getting into the swimming group. 
PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Which would throw in even more training. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I'm going to suggest that if you throw that in, that you really cut back somewhere else. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR:  Over exercising can pull you into your addiction as quick as anything. 
PATIENT: Yeah. I just wouldn't be able to do that much. Because that takes up a lot of time too. And I've actually just, I found, I was on the website for the Peace Corps.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The other day.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I want to find something where I can kind of fully transition back into working and stuff. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it's got to be completely different because I don't want to serve. And I don't want to work retail. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Or in a bar or anything like that. So I was on this website and I found this part time position that's out of Portland and it's actually with one of the companies like I think it's called, Care Enterprise Partners. And what it basically does is, it works with lower base economies and sends different people from different businesses over all throughout the world. And this position I would be kind of being like a recruiter. So I think it would be good because it's only 20 hours a week but it would kind of be giving back. You know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's what I want to do... and it would also center my day around something other than just exercise. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I agree.
PATIENT: So I was going to forward you the link just to see what you thought about it. 
COUNSELOR: Okay. Would the part time job give you the kind of the financial stability or would you have to have a full time job soon? 
PATIENT: Well this is only for 11 weeks. 
COUNSELOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: I thought it would be really good because I could do this and then I could go right into something full time. And if I did well at this it might even lead to a full time job.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah. Okay.
PATIENT: But I just thought you know it's 11 weeks. It would be a good amount of time so that I'm accountable to something for 20 to 30 hours a week. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. 
PATIENT: But I still have time to focus on myself, which is important to me. 
COUNSELOR: Right. Well I think that sounds good. And I do think that volunteer work is a very good idea. And if you know that you're active, being a Big sister to a kid that you could do  activities with, like go rollerblading with.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: That's a good way to add to the community and stay active. Coaching a girls' softball teams at one of the Rec. centers. You know? Again it's going to be something that'll keep you active and give you a chance to move around and get that balance that exercising is going to bring you, especially if it is a component of keeping you out of the depression. But it won't necessarily feed the addiction. Because that's the protection you want. You want to protect your abstinence. You want to protect it long term. You don't want to end up protecting the disease. 
PATIENT: Mm-hmm. Okay.
COUNSELOR: So more things that you can think of that are activities that keep you involved with people and being part of a community, the better. 
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: So I like the job, the idea of the recruiter. As a part time and that it might move into something else. You'll find out if it sounds like it's going to meet any of your interests if you can get an interview. 
PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Let's try to-
PATIENT: Yeah I have one tomorrow. 
COUNSELOR: Oh good. Good. Good. 
PATIENT: She said, "Can you just send me your resume?" And I said, "Well for sure I would, but may I please come in and meet you?" Because when you first start out -  I mean my resume isn't very expansive in an entrepreneurial business kind of sense; it's way more geared towards history and things like that. 
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: So I really just wanted to be able to meet her.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And put a name to a face. 
COUNSELOR: And she was open to that?
PATIENT: Yeah I have a meeting tomorrow at 10:30 with her. 
COUNSELOR: Good. Good. Good.
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: You know that's the part that I would say you want to keep alert to is, "Does this feed my disease or does this feed my recovery." That's the best question you can ask kind of overall. And the answer might be yes and sometimes no on the same activity, the same schedule. So right now it may not be feeding the disease. The potential for it is there. So you just want to keep alert in case it does start to feed the disease. [0:24:50.5]
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: But the more you can make it about an active lifestyle probably the better. 
PATIENT: Yeah. And just involving activity in my day. Not just my day into my activity.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. And that's why I thought the swimming idea's probably a better one than a spinning class five times a week. You know?
PATIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
COUNSELOR: And if you're already are seeing a trainer three times a week then you don't have to necessarily get there the fourth time. If you're doing the socializing.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know with the swimming. So that's all I'm saying. Just keep it alert. Because it's like somebody who is working in the food service arena... it's just a high risk dynamic. 
PATIENT: Yeah. And I'd say you know it's too bad; I mean obviously it's pretty out there to think that someone with an eating disorder can go and work in a restaurant. I mean how I thought I could do that I'm not quite sure what I'm thinking there. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But it is just the most convenient thing for me to do. But as you say, I'm not really bettering society or myself.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. If somebody was already in that and that's their only livelihood -  As Jillian has in our group has struggled and struggled and then finally had the accident where hopefully it's a wake up call and she's talking about, "I don't want to go back. That is not where I want to be." 
PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
COUNSELOR: But that was her livelihood. I know somebody that got sober, and their first three months of sobriety their job was tending bar. That's the only job they had. They had to keep paying the rent until they can get another one. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And they've stayed sober. 
PATIENT: Okay. 
COUNSELOR: Okay. All righty. I think we're on the books for later this week, right?

PATIENT: Yep.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I've got you down for a 9:00 on Friday. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So just kind of let what we talked about kind of percolate. 
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: And I don't necessarily have a sense you're going in the wrong direction for the wrong reasons. But I know that you're going in a direction that could potentially be troublesome. So I just want-
PATIENT: With the exercising?
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: And yet I think from everything you're saying, and I think it's coming from you, not the addiction, that you know your life works better being active. So you do want to keep it in there.
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You just want to keep it in there in ways that the addiction can't use against you. 
PATIENT: Okay. 
COUNSELOR: All right. Well I know I'm going to talk to you tomorrow at group. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: All right. Okay. Bye. 
PATIENT: Bye bye.
