<b>Chapter 4</b>

In order to return to our home it was necessary for us
to pass within a few miles of my boyhood home where my
parents still lived. With some hesitation, I asked Mary, "Do
you mind if we stop for a few minutes to see my folks?"


"No, not at all," she said.


Amid all the turmoil, I was pleased when Mary agreed
to stop. It had been a long time, too long, that I had been
absent from home. As I entered my parents' driveway a feeling
of having neglected them overcame me. I felt guilty.
Nevertheless, our surprise visit was a welcome one.


My mother trotted out the fatted calf, so to speak, with
her usual insistence that we have something to eat. While we
lingered over a late supper we explained, in as brief terms
as was possible, that we were just returning from a short
trip to New York. We did not explain the purpose of our
trip, and they did not question us.


"Of course you're going to spend the night," my mother
ventured.


I looked questioningly at Mary, who seemed to agree.


"Yes," I replied. We were still a long way from home.


During that evening with my parents I sensed that Mary
was doing her best to maintain a stable demeanor, but
I somehow felt that she was becoming more and more
disturbed.


From time to time she expressed concern over our seven-year-old

Little, if anything, did my parents suspect Mary's condition
or the events which had preceded our arrival. At about
ten o'clock in the evening Mary came close to me.


"I'm concerned about Bob, and I want to go home,"
she said.


"All right," I answered.


I had quickly concluded that the suggestion that we depart
had best be followed. I saw then that Mary seemed even
more disturbed, and feared that she might have an emotional
attack which would arouse the suspicions of my parents.
Over their protests, but with their good wishes, we left.


It was about eleven o'clock at night as we edged the car
nearer home at a moderate rate of speed. The baby was
sleeping in Mary's arms. We had gained the turnpike, and
had been traveling on our way for some time when Mary
began to cry. She told me that her right leg had become
numb. It was an attack of hysteria of which I did not know
the significance and which bewildered me. It was like a
soldier crying over an old wound.


There followed a severe attack of anxiety, and all the
fears in the world bore down upon Mary. Her crying became
hysterical and hard. It was the worst attack Mary had
ever had. She wept for some time, and complained about
her leg. It was then that she told me that while in New York,
she had seen foreign faces that seemed to resemble that of
an Italian acquaintance of ours who lived nearby at home.
She also told me that the directional signs along the highways
had seemed symbolic to her and have some meaning
for her other than that intended.


Upon my hearing these admissions, and sensing the seriousness
of Mary's condition, I gave not a little thought to
what action I should take. I was not long in making a
decision.


As we were approaching the city of Baltimore, Mary-land,
I decided that I would seek out the Johns Hopkins

I did not tell her of my plans. When we arrived in the
suburbs of the city, I stopped under the pretense of buying
gasoline.


"Which is the direction to the Johns Hopkins Hospital?"
I quickly asked the station attendant.


He directed me to a point not too far distant. By this
time Mary had quieted down, but I was determined to get
her some kind of help.


"Are we lost?" Mary asked, as we left the main thoroughfare
and turned into a side street.


"No," I replied. "I am going to get you some kind of
assistance. I am taking you to a doctor."


Mary did not answer.
