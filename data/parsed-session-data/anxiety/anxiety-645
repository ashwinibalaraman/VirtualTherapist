STRANGE<br />
I. SEX WITH A NEW SEXUAL PARTNER....<br />

—URBAN DICTIONARY


LAST NIGHT I dreamed I slept with a married colleague.


It is late summer and I am going to a meeting on campus, beginning
my second year in a job at a small university near the beach in
South Carolina. I smile into my coffee cup at the memory of imagined
pleasure. Flashes of the dream come back to me as I am brushing my
teeth. He pulls me toward him by the hips. We are in the back seat of a
car somewhere. I straddle his lap and we laugh and laugh. We are sitting
next to each other in a meeting, our hands side by side at the edge of
our seats. He loops his pinky finger over my thumb and my whole body
runs hot. I slow this snippet down in my imagination. I swish mouthwash
from one side of my mouth to the other and stare at myself in the
bathroom mirror.

<i>Do I want to have an affair with this man?</i><br />
IN A WAY, YES.


<i>I want to push my face into his tweedy shoulder, feel<br />
his hand on the back of my hair, inhale the scent<br />
of his body and close my eyes. I want this feeling of<br />
being enfolded, the relief of this turning away. Not<br />
a real affair—not the faked-out wife or late night<br />
rendezvous at Huddle House—just this. A hand stroking<br />
the back of my head, a still and quiet place apart<br />
from the pace of the world</i>.


I look in the mirror once more to smooth down my hair against
the late August humidity.


It isn't any particular person I want to lie down with and make my
own. It isn't anybody at all. It is the feeling of being taken care of that
I want to pin down and rock my hips against. Sling a leg across it and
fall asleep.


This longing for body comfort and security is familiar as my own
face.


The need is urgent.


<b>THE NEED MAKES ME STUPID</b>.

I dream about having an affair and for the first time I see through
the dream to the longings beneath it. I feel SMART. I load my briefcase
with books and papers and skip down the stairs to my car. I head
for campus where I will lecture college students about literary motifs
like FALLEN WOMEN and SALVATION and SACRIFICE and SCAPEGOATS, still
thinking about my dream and the affair I might have and the mirror
I looked into. I stand in front of the class with false courage, thinking
SMART means SAFE. <i>If not love then surely knowledge can save me</i>.
I break a sweat filling the board with notes, not yet grasping the difference
between knowing and understanding.


Each word marks a gap in my psyche.


Internalization is not signaled by words but by silence when neurotic
speech stops circling the gap.

EMILY AND I are sitting in her living room, the least well-heated room
of the house, and my hands are cold. I tuck them between my knees.


Emily says, "You're not in touch with any of your exes?"


I say no and feel vaguely ashamed. Like she's giving me a psychological
test. And I'm failing. I refill my wine glass and try to explain.


LESS THAN ONE year later, Emily and I are ensnared in an all-consuming
affair with each other—flying in the face of her monogamous
relationship of twelve years with a woman named Vanessa, risking
our relationship as co-workers and friends—and the affair capsizes on
the rocks and shoals of our separate needs.

<b>I NEED TO TALK TO HER</b>.


<b>MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT</b>.


<b>SHE TELLS ME THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE</b>.


"I need space," she says. She means for her monotone to defuse the
conversation. I respond to the flat line of her voice by turning up the
volume on my end—as if this contest of need requires a specific number
of decibels and I have to make up for her deficit by making my own emotions
louder—letting rip with a primal scream.


"YOU WANT SPACE?<br />
YOU WANT SPACE?!<br />
YOU'VE GOT IT."


I throw my phone at the wall. I cry. Scream again. Shake. I slam
a kitchen cabinet door shut twenty times in a row. I clutch myself hard
enough to leave bruises and drag my fingernails down the backs of
my arms. I sit on the brand new Berber carpet in a room I keep neat
as a pin and carve Emily's initials into my ankle, angled lines making
rough letters like a child might draw. I think to myself, I NEVER WANT
TO SEE HER AGAIN, clutching my foot and watching the letters bead
up with blood.

THE NEXT DAY my face is swollen from crying. I keep getting pieces
of cheap tissue stuck in my eyelashes. My hour of emergency psychotherapy
is almost up.


"This is good," my therapist Paula tells me. "It's good this is
happening to you. You tend to intellectualize. You need to feel this."
We are two minutes past the hour. I write a check for the twenty-five
dollar co-pay.


"I DON'T FEEL GOOD," I tell her.


"It will get better," she promises. "You won't always feel this way." I
smile, nod, and stand to leave, but secretly I don't believe her.

<i>Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation</i>


IN THE 1960S a wave of scholarly attention rose up in the United
States around the psychology of intimate attachment bonds, cresting
in an experiment called the STRANGE SITUATION. The child developmental
psychologists who devised the Strange Situation methodically
activated attachment behaviors in their infant subjects—behaviors like
seeking proximity to the caregiver, vocalizing distress, and demonstrating
receptivity to feeding and holding—by having a mother leave
her child briefly in an unfamiliar room where a stranger interacted
with the child. The mother returned and engaged the infant. Then the
psychologists recorded the reactions of infant to mother, generating a
taxonomy of attachment styles—SECURE, AVOIDANT, AMBIVALENT, and
(later) DISORGANIZED—to describe a child's sense of whether the object
of her affection can be trusted to give comfort. The longer and more
frequent the separations, the louder the protest cries and the longer the
recovery time. Subsequent studies showed that sustained periods of
separation—due to a mother's illness, a child's hospitalization, a parent's

By the late 1980s the American public sat transfixed by questions
of love, sex, friendship, and intimacy. It was the era of <i>When Harry Met
Sally,</i> and more urgent than the question of whether men and women
can be friends was the question of whether adults can find comfort in
each other or if disappointment, deceit, and sudden departures were to
be expected instead. The nuclear family was all poltergeist and regret.
As couples opted for no-fault divorces and kids faced the challenges
of parents grieving separations and forming blended families, people
wanted to understand the puzzle of romance. Social psychologists continued
to work on the problem of intimacy, developing love quizzes and
attachment interviews to measure the persistence of beliefs about self
and other, from early pair-bonding between child and parent to adult
romantic relationships.


<i>Fatal Attraction,</i> the second highest grossing film of 1987, dramatized
American fears of <i>attachment gone awry</i>. In it, a woman named
Alex Forrest (Glen Close) seduces and becomes obsessed with a man
named Dan Callagher (Michael Douglas) to the point of stalking him,
his wife, his daughter, and their ill-fated pet bunny. Despite the apparent
presence of mental illness in this woman—who fakes a pregnancy,
cuts her leg with a butcher knife, slits her wrists, and dissociates in the

THE VERY SAME YEAR, 1987, saw the development of the HAZAN-SHAVER
ADULT ATTACHMENT INTERVIEW, a device to measure and
compare attachment styles among adults. Most people fall into one of
three categories derived from Mary Ainsworth's <i>Strange Situation,</i> each
represented by a cluster of statements about optimal psychological space.


<b>SECURE</b>


I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am<br />
comfortable depending on them. I don't often worry<br />
about being abandoned or about someone getting too<br />
close to me.


<b>AVOIDANT</b>


I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others;<br />
I find it difficult to trust them completely, difficult to<br />
allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when<br />
anyone gets too close, and my partners often want<br />
me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being.


<b>ANXIOUS/AMBIVALENT</b>


I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Research institutions like SUNY Stony Brook and UC Davis
established Adult Attachment labs for longitudinal studies of the adult
children subjected to the STRANGE SITUATION test in the late 1960s and
early 1970s.


Some people move confidently through the world, expecting to
return to a secure base at the end of every day. Others manage the
risk of being disappointed by remaining aloof and abdicating intimacy
altogether. In between secure and avoidant there sits a riddle
called ANXIOUS-AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT. People with ambivalent or
anxious-fearful attachment styles long desperately for intimacy but
their world is peopled with failures. They ask adulterers for loyalty
and they ask liars for honesty. They hide their true feelings, forget
the hiding place, and rage when no one can find them. They sharpen
the edges of ingenuity against the abrasive whetstone of a withholding
lover. Security is always elsewhere. Preoccupied by its pursuit,
they walk into strange rooms and fold their bodies in strange arms
to study their own strange faces in the reflection of a stranger's eyes.

<b>YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT COULD GET
WORSE BUT IT DOES</b>.


When security and anxiety are elicited by the same attachment
figure, an endless loop is initiated: fear and the need for reassurance
are followed by rejection and the intensification of fear. Approach and
avoidance mesh in the person's gestures; she moves towards the mother
but averts her eyes or turns around and walks backwards toward her.
As adults, members of this group have trouble regulating their own
emotions. They wonder who on earth would want them. Why belong
to a club that would have you as a member?


SCIENCE LABELS THEM DISORGANIZED.


FAMILY MEMBERS JUST CALL THEM DIFFICULT.

IMMEDIATELY UPON OR JUST FOLLOWING APPROACH<br />

I ENTERED HIGH SCHOOL THE SAME YEAR GLENN CLOSE BOILED
HER LOVER'S BUNNY IN <i>FATAL ATTRACTION</i>. I was fourteen and infatuated
with a boy who played trombone in the marching band. I had spoken to
him in passing maybe twice. I maybe wanted to lose my virginity to him.
I made eyes at him until his girlfriend threatened to blacken one of them.
At home I panted at the television screen as young lovers sexed each other
in bathtubs and on trains, the VCR squeaking as I hit pause and rewind.
On the way to my piano teacher's house I picked up amber pieces of broken

My classmates had my number from go.


<i>You're a nice girl. But a little weird</i>.


I graduated high school, got engaged, and moved out of my father's
house to get away from his new wife, a woman with a gift for the passive-aggressive
alienation of affections. She openly stated her intention to
enter his life as a wedge between him and his daughters. He married her
anyway and carved out a little paradise behind the house where her son
could dive and splash in a new pool. I went to college fifteen minutes
away but was asked to leave my house key before I left. I still have trouble
resisting bitter envy toward the freshmen moving in each year at the
university where I work, when I see their parents toting large plastic bags
up the stairs bearing dorm decor from Target.

THE FEELINGS THAT struck me as enormous and unmanageable
could have been easier to face and process had I seen them situated in
simple conceptual maps like the two-dimensional model of interpersonal
style published by Kim Bartholomew and Leonard Horowitz in
the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i> in August of 1991 as my
second quarter of college began. It was out there but I had no access to it.
One axis measures thoughts about self and another measures thoughts
about other people, producing four basic categories of attachment.

Maybe I would not have gone crazy for the next fifteen years if
ideas produced in ivory towers found their way more steadily and with
less anti-intellectual distortion into the mainstream.


The field of adult attachment studies tempts the arm towards the
blunt force of blame—<i>I'm fucked up and it's all your fault!</i>—but blaming
external sources is not really the point of psychoanalytic theory. Instead
of good parents and bad parents, theorists speak of more ambiguous
things like the GOOD-ENOUGH MOTHER and the problem of the POOR FIT
between child and environment. In nonoptimal parent-child relationships,
the predictor of the adult child's approach to romance is not the
parent's behavior but the ideas that form and clot in a child's mind to
explain parent, self, other, and world with the uncanny logic of dreams
and dark tales.

MY FATHER WAS a senior in high school in 1969—the same year
Mary Ainsworth first published her findings from the Strange Situation
experiment—and he still lived in his familiar home with his familiar
parents and wanted to please them with his familiar life.


In two years he will smoke a MAGIC CIGARETTE with a STRANGE
GIRL in a red miniskirt and fall instantly in love. She will lie and cheat
and steal and sleep all day and at first he will think this is GRAND. She
is so different from his family. He is mesmerized by this difference and
makes a theater out of it, staging a drama of a world where day is night
and night is day and people don't always choose work over play. She will
liberate him from the demanding morals of his Puritan parents and he
will stand close by her side like a proper disciple. She will teach him the
freedom of not caring about other people when they say things like, <i>You
hurt my feelings</i>.

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One day she will come to him and say she is with child. She will say
she doesn't know if it's his. She will say he has to marry her anyway.


She is testing him.


HE FAILS THE TEST.


<i>He marries her</i>.


Seven months later he smiles into my newborn face and invites me
to become his accomplice in a heist of a very grand scale.


He asks if I can keep a secret.


I say yes.


The secret comes to me not in whispers but in sighs and innuendo.
We are going to steal the red miniskirt fire from my mother. Then we
are going to run away. After we leave we will cover our tracks by lying
to everyone we meet.


"FIRE?" we'll exclaim like offended women. "We don't even like fire."
We will say: <i>my mother is fire / fire is bad / we prefer ice / it's so tidy</i>.

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We organize our faces into folded envelopes, like our new cool
blue life is all we've ever known. Beneath the frozen ground, I bury wild
memories of fire in an unmarked field and forget to mourn its loss.


My father teaches me THE TORMENT OF WANTING TO BURN.


Of hating what you want. Of wanting what you do not have. My
father teaches me the shame of hiding my capacity for vice like a felony
or a used syringe.


AFTER MY MOTHER he marries twice more. The second wife gives
birth to a new self in nine months, her crazy breaking like water on the
front steps of our house as she runs out the door. The third wife sets up
an obstacle course in their home marked with signs in a language my
father does not speak. He runs in circles and forgets to leave a bread-crumb
trail for his daughters. We call his name in the woods but all we
hear in response are echoes of our own voices.


I grow up thinking he got a raw deal. I grow up believing impatience
made him reckless. I am impatient too. I leap without looking.
My relationships are long hikes with irritating companions where I practice
the art of the nonverbal complaint.

I reenact my father's story....


<b>THE DRAMA OF HAVING PICKED<br />
THE WRONG PERSON</b>.


THE GENRE IS PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR, shot in stark
black and white. The heroine moves through her house in a phobic haze
of self-doubt. Lights flicker and dim above her head. Pictures go missing
from the walls. Footsteps echo from empty rooms.


Things are not what they seem.


The one who says I LOVE YOU is poised to deliver the most CUTTING
BETRAYALS. Intimacy reveals itself as ruse. Frightened and mistrustful, I
forgo my father's example and save myself from his fate in the forest of
disenchantment. I flip the script. I do the opposite. I only know one way
to make my life better.


GET ON THE BUS, GUS.


MAKE LIKE A TREE AND LEAVE.

I OPEN A bottle of wine with a picture of a monkey on it.


I am sitting on the balcony of my tiny new apartment watching
the sky flush coral. One bedroom. Plain white walls. Bland beige carpet.
Clean slate.


I am starting over again.


For more than ten months I listened every night to Anthony's
paranoid fears of not being taken seriously at work and gave him advice
and support when I could, but most of the time I just gave him the cold
shoulder because secretly I despised him.


When I began to fantasize about killing him—a single blow to the
head with a concrete block—I made his voice stop by moving out. Now
I can relax.


I am putting things behind me.


My mother's face when I left her house a day early<br />
because she was so high her eyes rolled back in her<br />
head when I talked to her.


Anthony's face when I asked him not to visit me at my new<br />
apartment. His face is a stone surface worn smooth at<br />
the base of a waterfall. He is shocked and mystified by<br />
the fact that I want nothing to do with him now.


My face when I buried it in my hands and cowered on<br />
the living room floor while Anthony screamed at me<br />
for describing him to a friend as a dark person.

Free as a bird, I fly from South Carolina to JFK to give a lecture at
Barnard on feminist media studies and quality television. I dine with two
Manhattan ladies who pay $12 for a glass of wine without blinking. One
of the ladies is named Lila. I find myself in a fast crush on her. She wears
a delicate necklace with a tiny o in silver that falls to the ocean bottom
of her clavicle. I look at the o like a mouth open in surprise and think
about kissing her. I tell her over dinner that I developed stage fright out
of the blue this fall. In a gesture of intimacy on par with a kiss she hands
me a pill. She feeds me fragments of it. One at dessert. One she brings
to me at the stage where I am preparing to speak. I love Lila a little bit.
I go home and tell Emily. She is my coworker and I solaced myself with
benign romantic thoughts of her during my unhappy cohabitation with
Anthony.


<b>I WANT SOMETHING FROM EMILY<br />
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT</b>.


A member of the English department dies unexpectedly. The rest
of us pass his office door with our mouths closed in mourning.


I picture the mass of lung cancer hiding behind his sternum since
last spring.


I picture Emily and me lying side by side on my bed and holding
hands.

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I GO TO the ocean with Emily and two other friends where we drink
wine under a full moon to remind ourselves that being alive can be beautiful.
I go to Thanksgiving dinner at her house and talk her ear off in
the kitchen. I wish we could eat our plates of turkey and cranberry sauce
over the sink while everyone else makes small talk in another room.
The New Year comes and I go to Emily's house to watch television. She
introduces me to the genre of dyke drama. We eat rich artichoke dip
and drink big glasses of red wine. We pause the show and I ask personal
questions like when she first knew she was a lesbian, how it started, if
she ever had boyfriends. She tells me her history. I'm curious because I
wonder if I might be a lesbian too.


I lean towards her when she admits past infidelities.


"So," I say. "You're a CHEATER," lining the word with wool like a
wolf. "Tell me more," I say. "Tell me everything."


Her throat opens like a morning glory.


I reciprocate by telling stories about my mother. When I express
the profound loneliness I experienced as a child, Emily listens and tilts her
head just right.

<b>SOMETHING UNFURLS IN ME</b>.


I tell her my mother showed me the shape the clock hands would
make when it was time to walk down to the road to catch a yellow school
bus winding through the mountains into Maggie Valley where I lived. I
tell her I stood at the end of the driveway in the cold and concentrated
on willing the bus to appear. I tell her I came home hungry at the end of
the school day and held my aching head in my hands while my mother
ran errands.


I tell her I ran into our unfinished basement crying because
my mother didn't love me and called my best friend Penny Moss to
confess. I needed someone else to know.


I wanted Penny Moss to make me feel better. It was like asking a
brand new acquaintance to drive me to the airport or feed my cat when
I leave town. Forced. Premature. Out of place.


We were maybe only best friends in my head.


Penny Moss and I were not friends at all by the next week. We
warred for popularity on the playground. Penny marched in one direction
with a group of girls behind her. I marched in the other direction
with others girls lined up in lockstep behind me.


We face off. All the girls circle round.

Penny pulls out her trump card. She points at me and shouts,
"HER MOTHER DOESN'T EVEN LOVE HER."


I hold my breath and wait. I feel the anonymous pinches of small
girl fingers, the twist and burn of girl hands on my forearms, the yank
and sting of pulled hair. I see the spots bald of rabbit fur on my new
winter coat. But the whirling girl dervish I anticipate never descends.
Instead they turn on Penny in anger.


<i>"No one's mother doesn't love them."</i>


They walk away in twos and threes. Being unloved by my mother
is unthinkable. They can't imagine it.


I walk away too.


FOR YEARS I will repeat the secret that my mother doesn't love me to
friends and family, lovers and strangers, over and over to take the sting
out of it.


"You tell everyone everything," Emily says. "The first night I met
you, you told me you were having an affair with a married man, you
were bisexual, and you were in terrible debt but digging your way out.
It's refreshing actually, the way you pour your heart out. But I wonder if
that moment on the playground is the reason why. I wonder if it all goes
back to Penny Moss." Emily pauses and takes a sip of wine, still thinking
about Penny betraying me on the playground. "I can't believe she did
that. That BITCH." I top off her glass and smile wider.

I tell Emily about the morning I noticed two bumps on the back
of my head—one on the left side and one on the right—near the base of
my skull. My mother is equal parts hysteric and hypochondriac and she
instilled in me an expectation of sudden catastrophe. Our bodies might
sprout a fairy circle of tumors. Our bodies made us shiver in fear and disgust.
We looked in the mirror and prepared ourselves to be horrified.


I watched my mother stick long Q-tips inside her caesarian sutures
to clean the wound when it wept and bled and split open. I walked into
the kitchen one day and saw two bags hanging over the stove dripping
purple liquid into a large pan. I worried her body had rejected her new
silicone breast implants. I worried she had to remove them. But it was
just grapes from our yard. She was making jelly. I saw a peach pit on the
edge of the bathroom sink and recalled my mother digging under the
skin of her face with a needle that morning. I worried she had pulled
some piece of gore from her body. When I feel the two bumps on the
back of my head, I think my body is revolting too.


I show them to my mother and ask what they are.


<i>"Horns. You're growing goat horns."</i>


I think about our goat Toro's horns before they grew from his
head—little nubs, hard beneath the surface of his skin. Just like mine.


<i>"Better watch out,"</i> she deadpans. <i>"They'll show through your
hair soon."</i>

Five years pass before I realize she was lying.


I wait five years to be revealed as part goat, part girl.


I tell Emily I ran away from home when I was eleven. I packed my
books and T-shirts in paper sacks and hid them beneath the low-hanging
branches of a magnolia tree at the far edge of the yard. My father would
pick me up that Friday afternoon and maybe never bring me back. I tell
her I ran through the yard with my arms full and held my breath as I
opened the door to come back inside. If Mother caught me she would
string me up in the yard and carve TRAITOR on my forehead.


I helped take care of my youngest sister Melissa for the first two
years of her life, bathing and feeding her and sometimes getting up in
the middle of the night to quiet her from crying. I thought about getting
married in four years when I turned fifteen and adopting Melissa so she
could grow up without being called bad names.


BRATS. DUMBASSES. BITCHES. SLUTS.
Our friends were IDIOTS and WHORES.


Emily and I cover our mouths in horror as we laugh. "I don't know
why I'm laughing," she says. "It's so awful I can hardly stand it."


"It is horrible, isn't it?" I like that she doesn't dismiss me with a wry
toast to Freud or Nancy Friday.


"I can just picture you," she tells me. "Standing alone at the end of
your driveway, waiting for the bus. You're so brave. That's who you are.
That brave little girl."

Emily misunderstands me from the very beginning but I won't let
myself know this for a very long time.


<b>I CAN'T. I NEED TO BELIEVE<br />
I HAVE FOUND THE ONE</b>.


Emily would say I underestimate her. She cared more for me than
I realize and understood me better than I think. I will become so confused
by her I won't even recognize the truth when she offers it to me.
<i>"My name is Emily!"</i> she will say to me and I will scream in her face to
stop lying.


I drain my wine glass and stare at the black windowpane behind
me, my mind suddenly empty. I can't tell if Emily might love me or if
she might just be looking at me through a glass case in a museum of
deformed curiosities.


Goat girl. Monster.


Soon everyone will know.

—ROY PORTER, <i>Madness: A Brief History</i>


I walked around my house as a young girl with my shoulders
hunched. I flinched a lot. I took my mother's words hard. I believed she
despised me. I believed I was despicable.


Some days even now I want to close the blinds and hide. I drive home
from Emily's house feeling ashamed. I said too much. I stayed too late.

When I fell into the blankness of Emily's dark windowpane, what
did I not want to see? What did I not want to know?


I disliked her as much as I liked her.


She made me uncomfortable. The discomfort was familiar.


Emily probed the open sockets in my mouth with her tongue while
her fingers wandered mindlessly over rough edges of old scabs, lifting
them up before new layers grew strong and pink. She dabbed blood from
my knee with a cloth napkin dipped in wine and smiled wider when I
winced. I left her house hurting. I tossed left and right, then right and
left, through the restless dreamless night.


"You must have had a terrible relationship with your mother," said
the wife of the last married man I dated. Two years before the affair with
Emily I sat across a bistro table in Barnes &amp; Noble with a woman training
to become a therapist. We were discussing her husband. She wanted
me to understand that our attachment was a symptom of his unresolved
conflicts with his parents and my unresolved conflicts with mine.


<i>How dare she?</i> I thought. <i>What malarkey</i>. Her words insulted me.


The sensation of insult masked an important fact.


What she said about the affair was true.

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My illicit obsessive fixation on her husband was a vehicle for
revisiting the mysteries and emotions of my childhood, but I wasn't
developmentally mature enough yet to read the road signs or to recognize
where I was going.


My mother and I are the original romantic couple.


She brings a criminal thrill to the mundane and I eagerly accept
the invitation to an outlaw apprenticeship at her knee. We are late for
things. We are not where we say we are. We sleep in and skip school /
skip basketball practice / skip ballet. We read trashy novels thick with
women gasping and being carried away by their passions.


On the way to the grocery store she tells me to watch for the fuzz
while she smokes one of the joints we rolled together this morning. Our
fingers worked together to sort seeds from the shake as if Mary-Jane were
maize and we were two Cherokee princesses preparing for the Green
Corn festival. I want to be let into her secret society so I boldly ate the
seeds. I want her wildness to grow inside me. I want her to like me as
much as I like her. I want her to recognize herself in me.


She says we are ON THE LAM. She says we are LOW RIDING.


I slouch deeper in the backseat and sing along with Rod Stewart
on the radio. <i>If you think I'm sexy and you want my body, come on baby
let me know</i>.


I am seducing my mother. I want her to want me.


I know I was a mistake. I know I don't belong.

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mother throws shade like a legendary drag queen. She brings
out secrets with the sharp surprise of a blade beneath the tongue.


<b>YOUR SISTER IS MY FAVORITE.<br />
HE DOESN'T WANT YOU—<br />
HE'S NOT EVEN YOUR REAL FATHER</b>.


She points at my body and laughs at my modesty and tells my
father when I grow pubic hair. She mocks me for thinking I have something
to hide. I play straight man to her comedy routine like a breeder
at the queer cabaret.


<i>Do not try to pass as well adjusted in this place,</i> the queen warns. <i>Show
us your banji realness before we scratch off that mask you call a face</i>. If I am
too loud or too slow or too needy she tells me to cram it and get lost.


GO PLAY IN THE STREET. TAKE A LONG WALK OFF A SHORT PIER.


I step out of her limelight and too-hot-ness and retreat to another
room where I rock my baby sister to sleep—two losers clutching each
other in the dark and calling it a hug. My red face and tangled hair tell
the truth about this moment. I cry like rejection hurts but really I'm
seething and planning to leave.

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At eleven I'm already more criminal than martyr.


The image of one sister comforting another is a trick backlit and
cropped tight. In the shadows outside the frame, a rubber mallet and
several large garbage bags sit neatly by my feet.


LIGHT AS A FEATHER STIFF AS A BOARD. I lie still enough to disappear.
I say CANDYMAN CANDYMAN CANDYMAN. I'd rather be anywhere
other than here. I choose the company of demons over my drag of a
mother. She confuses meanness with having a ball. She reads me but
doesn't get me at all.


"WHY ARE YOU considering visiting your mother this summer?" my
therapist asks, more than twenty years later. For years people have been
asking me some version of this question. I haven't seen my mother in
five years and I often think of a weekend reunion in Georgia, but every
time I visit the story is always the same. We have fun for a while. Then
we argue and I run away crying.


My therapist suggests placing limits on our time together. Maybe
I could meet her for lunch instead of staying at her house. I scan the
molding along the edge of the ceiling and reflect on why this would be
the worst solution ever.

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If I'm going to see my mother, then I need to see her at home.
I need to see her in bed. Like royalty, she takes visitors from atop
her king size bed. The inner circle may join her there. We serve at
her pleasure. We are dismissed at her bidding. We sit on top of the
comforter with pillows stacked behind us like we get bruises from
tiny peas. We watch avidly as soap divas wax histrionic at the touch
of a magical button. As afternoon turns to evening, the jesters in the
box play Jersey Mafiosi and serve cold dishes of revenge. Our errands
are done and we retreat from the irritations of dry cleaning and mall
traffic in the perfect bliss of caffeine and codeine and companion
animals that adore us. Her Maltese wrestles with my Shih Tzu and
they yip with glee at our return. My mother wonders aloud what the
dogs are saying as if they spoke Swedish or Urdu.


I hesitate at the idea of meeting for lunch because I don't want to
put our bipolar relationship on mood stabilizers. I fear some kind of loss,
our mother-daughter bond dull as old silver.


I like being ADDICT and BEDMATE and OUTLAW.


Favorite daughter. Fairest of all.

<i>The first time I developed a crush on someone else's boyfriend I
was nine</i>.


I spent my teenage years riding back roads with boys who did not
belong to me drinking Two Fingers Tequila from the bottle. I seek partners
who belong to other people and then work mightily at convincing
them to meet my needs.


Choose me.


I have affairs. I thieve love. I beg for it.


PEOPLE WANT WHAT THEY CANNOT HAVE.


I see people in relationships as compromised by definition. Delusional.
I am their rude awakening. I sleep with their husbands and
wives like snapping my fingers in front of their faces to break the
romantic trance. I steal their social security and call it a free service for
the legally blind and cognitively impaired.


I help them understand how the story ends.


<b>BOOM I got your boyfriend.<br />
HA HA I got your man</b>.

I sing along with MC Luscious in a full-body euphoric flush, never
wondering why the love triangle holds such irresistible appeal for me.
Even after white-knuckling a seven month loop-de-loop on Emily's
Romantic Mindbender, a rickety runaway train, I will enter therapy
with my defenses up, and when the issue of my attachment patterns
comes up, I will swat at the obviousness of the observation, waving it like
a pest from the wet places on my face.
