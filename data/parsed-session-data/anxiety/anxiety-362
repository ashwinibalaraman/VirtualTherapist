It was about a year later that a series of events occurring
close together sharpened my feelings suddenly into love,
and this time with an intensity and quality of feeling that
I had never known before. It came as a sudden, momentary
flash, and brought with it in that instant a reminder
of the sharp humiliation of my unrequited love for
David. I cried out, "Oh no, not that again!" The moment
passed; within a few seconds it was over; I had so
checked and controlled desire that only the spiritual
component of affectionate and friendly love remained.


The sudden stimulus increased my intellectual activity;
new ideas came to me in a rush; and at the same time I
looked ahead towards the possible consequences of
success. If some of my hypotheses should prove correct,
they might be wholly unacceptable, so much so that they
could well cost me this vital new friendship and others too,
less intense but firmly grounded and most dear to me.
Would I, in that event, weakly compromise and tailor my
views to what others could accept? Or was I able to face
the loneliness of losing what I valued most for the sake
of truth?


This may seem an unreal and overdramatised situation,
for the belief that I was on the verge of brilliant and
important new discoveries had no basis in reality. But I
could not know that at the time, and the choice that presented
itself was, for me, a real one. I chose integrity. I
made a swift, clear and irrevocable decision that, if and
when this parting of the ways should come, I would go
on alone. The sequel was immediate and dramatic and
opened the gates of a new world.

Up to that time I had never had any subjective experience
which could be regarded as inexplicable or
abnormal. I had had my share of difficulties and had
dealt with them on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis with what seemed to be
considerable success. For many years now I had had no
religious beliefs, and felt no need of them. Life was a great
and wonderful mystery and I was glad to be part of it. I
was thoughtful about human problems and concerned
for the state of the world, ever seeking new knowledge,
and fired with the hope of new solutions to our age-old
problems. I discounted the supernatural except as an
irrational image that could for good or ill influence the
beliefs, and thereby the actions, of those who were
religiously inclined. Because of my general interest in
human beings I had read fairly widely on religious
subjects, had a fair knowledge of comparative religion,
and had sampled at first hand the writings of a number of
mystics, some Christian and some not. I could, up to a
point, sympathise with them; I had not been tempted to
share their views. What happened to me now induced a
bewildering intellectual somersault.


I had just completed the short, sharp struggle in which.
I determined to choose integrity at all costs in my search
for new knowledge. I got up from where I had been
sitting and moved into another room. Suddenly my whole
being was filled with light and loveliness and with an
upsurge of deeply moving feeling from within myself
to meet and reciprocate the influence that flowed into me.
I was in a state of the most vivid awareness and illumination.
What can I say of it? A cloudless, cerulean blue
sky of the mind, shot through with shafts of exquisite,
warm, dazzling sunlight. In its first and most intense
stage it lasted perhaps half an hour. It seemed that some
force or impulse from without were acting on me,
looking into me; that I was in touch with a reality beyond
my own; that I had made direct contact with the secret,

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048374-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It did not necessarily follow that God was a person as
we understand the term; my initial state of illumination
was highly abstract and gave no clue to that. It might be a
life force, an inorganic source of spiritual power transcending
all our own notions of individuality; but that it
was the external, transcendent source of life and beauty
and of truth, I did not doubt. I had never feared people,
and it did not occur to me now to be afraid of God; I was
astonished and awed at the magnitude of what had
happened to me, but I responded simply, warmly and
intensely as my natural self. It was, from that first instant,
a direct, reciprocated love relationship. It remained to be
seen what was its cause and purpose and what I should
make of it.


At the outset I had no hesitation in accepting what had
happened to me as a profound and true religious experience.
A few days later I went into a stage which gave me
cause for doubt. I moved as though in a dream; all the
fairy stories and romances I had ever read seemed to
have come alive in me, and I was myself at the centre of
all of them. At this point I grew gravely alarmed. Either
something of overwhelming importance had happened,
or else I was going off my head. I needed an outside
opinion if I was to find and keep my bearings. I wrote at
once to the friend with whom I had been corresponding
and asked leave to send him an account of my recent
experiences. That steadied me at once. The dream-like,
romantic phase ended; vivid experiences of new sorts
came to me, all with a strong and specific religious
context. These moved me deeply. At the same time the
state of stimulation I was in induced a further spate of
new ideas on human problems and on the interrelationship

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048374-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My new experiences prompted me to embark on an
attempt to explore and to reach some understanding of
religious experience. I took as my guide the scientific
trilogy: observation, hypothesis, experiment. I was like a
character in a fairy story embarking on a journey into
enchanted country, and taking the three tools that had
served best for finding the way in ordinary exploration.
And, as might have happened in a fairy tale, the tools
remained trustworthy as ever but, in the moment of first
using them, the magic of the moment had confused me,
and the path I took led to adventures far out of the realm
of any sober scientist.


My first assumption was that I was in touch with an
external source of spiritual knowledge. The second conclusion
I reached was that I was in touch with a living
person. The experience on which I based it was this. As I
lay in bed one night I felt drawn deeply down towards
what seemed to be a central source of love. It seemed also
a region of overwhelming grief and pain. I longed to let
go, to give myself completely and to be wholly at one
with something or someone whose desire matched and
reciprocated mine. At the same time I sensed that to
share completely in such pain would kill me. For myself I
did not count the cost; but my conscience held firmly to
the principle that my own task was to live. I had my own
responsibilities in daily life, other people needed me, and
my first duty was to them. I was drawn in and at the same
time I held back until the state of tension became almost
unendurable. Just at the moment when the pressure grew
more than I could bear, it gently eased and I was left in
peace. It was as though my inner strength had been
tested out by someone who was fully aware, and who
took skilful care not to destroy my own integrity. I

Being now sure that I was in direct touch with a person,
my next step was to determine the person's identity. Was
it some spirit unknown to me, was it Jesus of Nazareth,
or was it God himself? As I lay in bed I asked questions
in my mind and waited for the response. This came as a
negative or positive state of feeling, and my process of
exploration was rather like the children's guessing game
of ‘hot or cold’. From it I determined that the person in
question was not Jesus, but was God the Creator himself;
I also gained indications that Jesus had been very
dear to him, and that he himself had suffered in his pain.
Now for the first time the vision of the Christian story as
a literal truth took hold of me. It came to me as a new and
vivid revelation that Jesus could in fact have been the
son of God. And from this, based on my knowledge of
personal relationships, there followed the conviction that
in the drama of the crucifixion it was God the Father who
must have suffered most. My next stage of exploration
was to try to find out why relations between God and
man had reached a stage which made such a drastic
remedy necessary.


The conclusion gained from my experiences was that
God had feelings comparable with those of human
personality. I assumed that his existence as a person in
this sense antedated the evolution of the human species,
that life had evolved in response to stimuli which came
ultimately from him, and that the human race provided
at last conscious beings who could—at first in tentative,
crude, anthropomorphic ways—become aware of him.

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048374-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The belief that God was essentially humble-minded
had arisen in me as a direct result of my recent experiences.
At first I was astonished, but on second thoughts
it seemed quite reasonable. Since he had always been
himself, it was natural that he should take himself for
granted. That he should be able to evoke love in his
creatures could well have been unexpected, a delight and
novelty. That he should also provoke fear and disturbance
and guilt and at times outright hatred was, granted
the disparity in nature and the difficulties of communication,
a natural outcome, but one which—since no such
intention had been present—could not have been foreseen.
The need thus arose for someone who shared the
nature of God and understood his intentions and feelings,
and who also had experience of life in human terms. This
I now believed was the role that Jesus of Nazareth had
played, and the reasons for his successes and for his
failures then became clear.


The message of God's love and readiness for forgiveness
was received with joy by those who were emotionally
able to receive it; by those, that is to say, who were able
to believe in and to respond to love. Those whose
religious life was undermined by fear and defended from
it by rigid ritual, saw the new teaching as a dangerous
threat; among them the more influential who relied on
status for lack of deep personal security had the strongest
incentive for active and malicious opposition. The sinful,
to whom the message of love and forgiveness was
especially directed, were often actively alienated. Jesus
presented himself as the well-loved son who was a model
of goodness and an example to his erring brothers. There
is nothing, in a family setting, that is more likely to arouse

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048374-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The gesture of the innocent and good son suffering for
the guilty ones and bearing the brunt of their negative
feelings out of the abundance of his own love, was
moving and vitalising in some ways; but in others it
defeated its own end. Those who, from faulty development
and experience, could not accept love, were unable
to respond. In others it encouraged a relationship of
extreme dependency and guilt. To be redeemed from the
consequences of the ills of our own nature, and to have
the whole price paid by someone else, creates a sense of
obligation that may be too great to be borne. A far greater
satisfaction is to be had in helping constructively to work
out our own salvation.


From my own viewpoint as an ordinary human being I
voiced these comments now to God. As one who had
valued goodness without ever being specially good, I
felt I was in a position to see both sides and to speak up
for the human race. Others might well have been better
qualified, but my impression was that those who had
come nearest to God in a direct relationship had spent

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048374-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One of my original stumbling-blocks to accepting
Christian teaching had been the doctrine of the Last
Judgement with the casting out into damnation of those
who could not or would not be saved. The modern
Church may try to tone this down, but it stands definitely
as the teaching of Jesus in the New Testament. As I
reviewed it, I could see reasons why it might have seemed
a necessary plan. If some men were, by nature and by
choice, intrinsically evil, there might have been no way
of ensuring the spiritual health and happiness of the others
except by the final destruction of this group; a process
analogous to the removal of a carcinoma from a human
body in time to prevent the spread of the malignant
growth to healthy cells. But since all men were born of and
beloved by God, this piece of major spiritual surgery
would leave God scarred, and would inevitably cause
him lasting pain. I was concerned for the human race and
for those members of it who would be involved, but my
new relationship with God made me concerned most of
all for his own sake. Speaking as a human I could say
with conviction that evil is never a deliberate choice; it is
a form of mental sickness that arises from disturbance
and distortion of impulses which are in themselves
potentially healthy. No one who has a true choice and
knows what health is like can wish to be sick, though
they may well not know how to avoid it. Believing this I
believed also that the trend was eventually reversible,
and that, if life beyond death was planned, there could be
no justification for letting some live the new life while

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048374-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By the time I reached this stage, my spiritual experiences
had lasted continuously for about five months.
They took place mainly at night because my daytime
hours were fully occupied. I had a full-time job, I had
still a normally active social life, and in such time as I
had to spare I was writing an account of earlier experiences
to fill in the background and to give a rational
starting point for my ‘conversion,’ so that I could get an
objective second opinion on my new relationship with
God. I never had time to catch up on this; events moved
too fast.


My health had at times given me cause for mild concern.
I noticed various changes. I was constantly overstimulated;
I had to give up taking coffee and tea because
they had such an extreme effect on me. I became excessively
hungry and seemed to burn up my fuel to its last
reserves. My sensitivity to pain was heightened. My
salivation was increased. I mentioned some of these
things to a psychiatrist whom I met socially and he dismissed
them as of no account, so I did not seek further
medical advice. It did not occur to me to check my weight;
I had in fact lost about two stone. I slept well when I had
time to do so, and did not feel tired.


In the uprush of feeling which started off after the
first episode of ‘illumination’ I had several times sensations
similar to those induced by sexual experience, but
of a non-specific kind; a phase of excitement rising to a
crisis and subsiding into a sense of exquisite release. In
momentary enthusiasm at the time I concluded that this
was a pattern of physiological reaction specially designed

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048374-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Meanwhile, I began by degrees to get a sense that some
great disaster was impending. I was perhaps influenced
partly by an earlier incident. I walked back from work one
day with a curious feeling of heaviness and a sense that
God was calling me. On return I lay down on my bed.
In my earlier experiences I had a sense of direct contact
with God but as though he were also, in his central being,
at a distance. It seemed now that he was, in essence, completely
present with me in the room, and that he was in
great distress. I responded intuitively with concern and
warmth of feeling, and a sense of peace returned. I discovered
later that, at the same time as this was happening,
someone in a flat above me had been committing suicide.
This was the most dramatic of a number of coincidences,
and it heightened in me the sense that my own
experiences were only one small conscious aspect of some
much larger spiritual event which was now reaching its
critical stage.


By the time I came to deal with the question of the Last
Judgement, I had developed a sense of the foreshortening
of time. I had been considering time past in its
astronomical vastness, and seeing evolution as a visible
development; in my imagination I watched it as one

By now I was on the verge of losing rational control,
but I continued to live a normal life for a further week or
two. I was sometimes exhausted and often anxious, but I
was full of hope and I felt tremendously alive.


Colours became more vivid. I saw the sunlit countryside
blaze out with the intensity of a Van Gogh.
