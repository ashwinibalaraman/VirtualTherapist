CLIENT: I hope (ph).
THERAPIST: Yes (ph). Well just it's too distracting and I actually keep it here sometimes.
CLIENT: Oh yeah. Ooh!
THERAPIST: Well I'm glad this worked out.
CLIENT: I know. Thank you so much for your flexibility, it's great, I'm so grateful. Chris, Chris's looking into the insurance today (chuckling).
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: He needs a little reminder (chuckling) [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: ... so.
THERAPIST: Well I mean that's fine. I mean with this you know it helps to subsidize the treatment and I will be [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ... make it possible for you.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So if the insurance works out, great.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And if not, you know.
CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like I'm stuck in kind of a, a [inaudible at 00:00:34] I, I've e-mailed this woman a few times, who I'm trying to get insurance through with the state, and I hate to keep e-mailing (chuckling) her like [inaudible] 'cause she doesn't know, but oh my goodness (chuckling) come one already (chuckling). So he, he's, she's looking into it. I asked him last week and then he (whispering) forgot.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: So (chuckling), so, anyway (big breath).
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So just start?
THERAPIST: M-hmm, yes.
CLIENT: Okay (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Just like the last few times. [00:01:01]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, so what happened over the week. We went out to my parents' house for Thanksgiving and, um, I was, I was actually really happy that I had talked to you before about the driving concern, 'cause I just look at that like the drive (ph) really makes very tense and anxious, especially on highways. And I, um, my girlfriend, who I went with, and her husband kept offering to drive; I just drove the whole four hours. It was like this looking (ph). I don't know, you know like I feel good doing it and I'm gonna like, for some reason when I feel good doing things I keep pushing it (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: But then it was great and I felt like since I'd, had kind of talked it through beforehand it was not, um, something that made me very tense at all. I just need to look for a hair tie. Um, so yeah, it felt good and we, you know we had a nice Thanksgiving at our parents' house. [00:01:57]
And my brother, John, the one who's close to my age and who has some so similar behaviors to my dad, um, showed up, uh, to my mom's house pretty drunk already for Thanksgiving, which isn't surprising but that's kind of, that's kind of typical but, um, he then like continued to drink. And, um, you know I, I hadn't spent any time with him. I asked him to come sit near me for Thanksgiving dinner so I could chat with him and see him. And he rolled his eyes at me and said he was going to watch the football game. And this is my brother who I talk to every day on the phone, who I'm very close with, and so I like, you know it really hurt my feelings.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And he did it mostly because he, he was uncomfortable and he another who really takes it out on, uh, other people, but I can't, in those moments, not take it personally. So he, um, just continued to get more and more drunk, to the point where I'm pretty sure he was blacked out. [00:03:03]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And he, he and my younger brother had gone to see my brother's dad's family for Thanksgiving earlier in the day, and they were, you know they were drinking. And my younger brother said, "John, you know you can't drive. I'm gonna, you're gonna to come with me." And my brother, John, the one who drinks, is always two steps ahead and said "well leave your, you can drive my car" and (chuckling) my brother, Fred, who doesn't drink, doesn't think in the same way that (chuckling) kind of, so he said "all right, no big deal". So they drove John' car to my mom's house.
And then (clearing throat) later in the evening, when John was blacked out, he asked for his keys to go get something from his car, and I saw him go outside and, sure enough, two minutes later he was driving down the driveway going home, and he, this is typical, he does this. But you know I got really upset and you know was calling him and crying and, um, I just, I get really upset about it. [00:04:10]
Um, and you know I, I was just, I wasn't balling but I was teary eyed. And I came down the stairs at one point from calling him and my mom saw me and she just looked at me, "Well why are you crying?" (Sniffing) And I said, "I'm really concerned he's going to hurt himself, he's going to hurt somebody else, he's going to get another DUI, there's a whole host of things that could happen and I'm really upset about it." And she gave me this look like, you know relax about it.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And so it, and though I feel like I'm totally having this huge over reaction, but (sniffing) I think it's — I don't know, I don't — I think it's okay to be concerned about my brother driving when he's that drunk. I don't know why it — I don't know. She, I don't know, I don't know. That almost hurt my feelings more (teary chuckling) that, in those situations, I'm generally the one that's really upset and then made to feel like, just relax about it, like he's an idiot and he's doing the stupid thing and why are you getting so upset about it? [00:05:18]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And I, (heavy sigh) so. Um, and then the next, you know the next day, he did, he texts, he always just texts an "I'm sorry".
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Just you know like oh, like cute but it's typical family behavior, like or my you know kind I function behavior. I don't know (clearing throat). And I, that, and then I always go back and barumph (ph) ahead. 'Cause what, what will normally happen is he calls me and he asks, "Did I do anything really stupid?" 'Cause he usually blacks out, "So did I do anything really stupid?" And then I just comfort him and I tell him like, "No, you didn't, it's not a big deal. You just did, like you did this one thing" and then I would make a joke out of it. [00:06:06]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But I'd be like, that I was like, I'll say like "oh, well you did this one thing that was really funny" or I'll say like "no, everybody was drunk, it's not a big deal" or I'll say something like that and he'll still, it'll like happen for a few more phone conversations. The next few conversations he'll bring it up again and say like "you sure it's fine?" and I'll always comfort him, I'll always say "it's fine". (Big breath) And so this time I didn't.
And I don't, I don't know, I, I always, I'm afraid of — in the past what's happened is, if I draw out, if I say that I'm concerned about his drinking, it pushes us apart. He says that I'm saying he's like Dad and he gets really defensive and then I get really emotional. And when I get really emotional, pretty much everyone in my family (chuckling) gets a little ooged (ph) out [overlapping voices] [00:06:57]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... and backs off (chuckling). Um, so (making frustrated noise) normally when I make, when it, when I say something negative about his drinking, it, we do this.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And so, um, you know if he wasn't getting any responses from me after the text message on, on the day after Thanksgiving, so he kept calling and calling. And I finally answered and I just said to him "I'm, I'm really mad at you." And I told him why I was really mad at him and I said I was, you know explained about that I'd wanted to spend time with him at Thanksgiving and him not spending time with me, and he said that that was a complete overreaction. And then that, and I, and I said, "You're, you're right. But I still don't think it's okay for you to drive when you're that drunk, it's really unsafe and I get really scared (big emotional breath)." And, um, you know and I got pretty mad at him and, um, I don't know it's just, it's, it's been fine since. [00:08:01]
He had to come over for Chris, my husband's birthday dinner at my parents' house, so we've seen each other and we've, we've chatted a couple of times but it's still there's weirdness between us and just bums me out. And I give myself all this credit. I always think like, well if I do this it'll change his behavior in this way. And I, if I, I feel like I'm like playing my parents' marriage, I mean [at least to the] (ph) brother. It's like I, I do, I feel, I feel like I'm always trying to figure out the best way to be with him to make — I don't even know what — to make him comfortable or to make him like, to make him behave how I want him to, I guess. I don't know but it's pretty frustrating. I'm pretty disappointed with the both of our reactions I guess.
THERAPIST: Hmm, both meaning?
CLIENT: Mm, his and mine. [00:09:00]
THERAPIST: What was disappointing about your reaction?
CLIENT: I just wish I hadn't — I don't know. I let it, I let it really get to me and really upset me, and I just keep proving how that's not effective, but I don't know. We also, you know the last few years it's really my, my two brothers, and I feel like we're kind of really in our own little thing, just because we're the only ones that are dealing with a lot of different situations, and it's just kind of the three of us that really lean on each other (sniffing). And so I think that I, I end up taking on these roles that my mom would kind of take on, but [overlapping voices] [00:09:46]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... she just doesn't really try. Uh, but yeah, I just wish, you know I wish I had it more, then afterwards a more genuine reaction to him. It all still felt like kind of calculated on my part, like if I say this certain thing 'cause he did this certain thing. I'm really afraid, like I'm still, even when I'm telling him that I'm mad, still really careful of not going too far, of not saying — and I guess that is, I think that, uh, you should do that. I don't think that I should say, "You're turning into Dad!" (Chuckling) I don't think I should say that. I don't think that's going to be a helpful thing, don't think he needs to hear it, 'cause I think it's probably already going on in his head. But my reactions still are very like, even when I'm mad I'm still using very cautious ways of speaking, I guess [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ... (clearing throat) but.
THERAPIST: You're worried about upsetting him? [00:10:51]
CLIENT: Very worried about upsetting him, yeah, upsetting him in a lot of different ways. I don't, I don't want to, I really don't want him to be upset. Um, (emotional) and I'm worried about, um, making it too much of an issue of his drinking because then sometimes that will just spiral it. If it, um, if he becomes too concerned with his drinking that'll just kind of set him on a tailspin, a lot of times, and I know what it's about, but.
THERAPIST: But it sounds like he's in a tailspin anyway.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well he's always in some sort of a tailspin. He's on [inaudible at 00:11:36] and, uh, he gets trapped in some sort of like whirlpools, I guess (slight chuckle). Um, you know he, he had some really bad behaviors for a long time that he's come out of. And he's gone back to school and he's really, he's really trying to get his, his stuff back, his life back together, so that's really exciting. But he's still [overlapping voices] [00:12:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ... got that, that drinking thing is the big one. And, um, it's just frustrating because he's a very self-aware person and he's very intelligent, but there's this huge thing that he just, it's like blacks out, just like can't see that. I don't know (big sigh). And I, I just feel this huge responsibility, all the time, to be the one that is honest with him but not too hon-, you know. That I feel like I can somehow find the right balance. I always think like, okay, I can just find the right way of saying this or doing this that will work, fuck (ph).
THERAPIST: Work to? [00:12:53]
CLIENT: To hel-, help him be more self-aware in, in his behaviors. I don't think he has any concept of how his drinking looks. You know the, the heavy wine pour, you know the full, and, and then the chugging and, and then just getting blacked out and just being the one that's blacked out at these family functions. And just going on these benders, and then just no awareness of these patterns that are falling in, into a really scary (making frustrated noise), you know that they're just not good, so. I don't know, I always feel like he knows that his drinking isn't great, but I don't think he really thinks of it as a big problem.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So that's my big concern. It's like an all or nothing thing with him and that really terrifies me 'cause that's how it was with my dad. [00:14:01]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So.
THERAPIST: What would it mean if he turned into your dad?
CLIENT: Uh, well it would mean that I've taken care of him for the rest of our lives.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: So.
THERAPIST: That somehow he's your responsibility?
CLIENT: Oh yeah, definitely (chuckling). I mean my, my [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Well why?
CLIENT: 'Cause no one else will. Mm, 'cause I just I love him too much to let him be by himself and so. Like my mom will say things like "I worried about having a drunk making a fool of me the first 20 years of my life, I'm not going to do it again", she means at like family functions. And I said "that's not really an option (chuckling)", but, um, sh-, I think she kind of feels like it is an option (teary chuckling) or I don't know if she thinks it's an option but I just never understood. [00:15:02]
She says that a lot, you know that she was worried about a dr-, a drunk making a fool out of her the first 20 years of her life, she doesn't want to keep doing it, and I never know what that means. Like what do you mean by that (chuckling and sniffing), where are you going with this? And so, um, yeah, basically well how I feel is that it is kind of, it's, it's made pretty clear by that the three of us are kind of just on our own and we better figure it out you know. So I do feel like if something, if he just follows this path then it's kind of up to me to help him sort it out (big breath), so. But which feels like a lot (sad). [00:16:05]
THERAPIST: I would say so.
CLIENT: Yeah (whispering). Um, so that was Thanksgiving (chuckling).
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: It was actually fun but.
THERAPIST: So you weren't there with your husband?
CLIENT: He was in California for a job interview.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And that he, um, he flew out the redeye Friday or on Thursday night and came in Friday morning. Um, John, my brother, has a lot of respect for Chris, my husband, and, um, kind of they get along really well. And, um, typically, if Chris's around John won't really do things like that. He won't, he kind of tries to save face a little bit around Chris.
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:16:55]
CLIENT: Um, and so I rely on him a little bit to, I never say anything to him like, you know like "if John does", I never ask anything of him really, it's just kind of what naturally happens, which is great, um, but he wasn't around that time, so. Even my younger brother, Fred, who is 19, said like "if Chris was around this would've never happened (chuckling)".
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: It's like "well probably not". But, um, yeah, so he came the next day. And, um, his, you know his best friend, who is married to my best friend, who came up with us, they were all there so it was, you know we had a lot of time with them and had a lot of family stuff, hikes and such, so it was nice. But, yeah, since then I haven't really spoken to my brother.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Um, (sniffing) anyway, that was that. And then, I don't really know what else (chuckling). [00:18:05]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, I was, you know when we were away for Thanksgiving we were like so busy and on the go and like just doing stuff with my friends. Emma and Jay, never stopped talking (chuckling), so they are delightful because they keep your headspace pretty clear 'cause they never let (chuckling), they don't give a [little bit frenzy to bill it] (ph), so it was great. I was, you know just felt really happy and like had a great weekend.
And then Sunday we came home and I was just sitting by myself; so that Chris had to do a lot of work. So I was just sitting by myself for a few hours and that's when I just get like just so tense, if I'm just by myself with nothing to do.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: It just makes me feel so tense, so I just got really anxious all Sunday night through kind of Monday morning. [00:19:00]
And Monday I went for a run, I pushed the baby in the jogger and kind of worked it out a little bit and felt so, a lot better, but it's like if I'm just alone with nothing, then I just get like just anxious. I don't know why that is, but, um. But something that makes me concerned is I always say you know "I'm just alone all the time with, with my job and with the girls 50 hours a week and it's just us".
And, um, I don't really make you know we just, we, it's just us. We don't like (sniffing), I don't make friends with other nannies 'cause a lot of them in the area aren't English speaking and a lot of them are just part-time, you know whatever. And so I always say that like I'm just, since I'm so, I'm just lonely and bored and that's what really contributes to a lot of my anxiety. [00:20:01]
But then I think (chuckling) well this is what I, you know I, in a few years what I want and what I've always wanted is to be a mom and to be, have a bunch of kids and to be at home with them and, and it's seeming more and more like that is what's going to happen (big breath), and that the fact that right now I keep saying that why I am so anxious is because I'm alone all the time with these kids (chuckling) but then that's what I want to do, that makes me really nervous. And so I have all these, um, I don't know, I get really upset about it. So, I don't, I don't know.
THERAPIST: That it is going to feel the same, which isn't good or even worse?
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.
THERAPIST: No (ph). [00:20:53]
CLIENT: So, um, (sniffing) yeah. Um, I don't know. Do you have any like suggestions for when I'm — I can, I can feel myself starting to get antsy, and when I get like that it's like I know it's coming and then it's just, I just feel that way for probably hours.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And I was wondering if maybe you had any sort of like suggestions for things that I could do or, um, I don't know, I feel like there has to be something (chuckling)?
THERAPIST: I don't know.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: We can talk about some things that make you feel better and are soothed, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Mm, yeah.
THERAPIST: ... you know that are soothing.
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: I feel like I can help you most by just sort of getting, helping you get deeper into that experience, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: ... with wondering what it's about. [00:22:00]
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: To me it seems like a more or like, then for lack of better term, like permanent cure (chuckling).
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But certainly you know developing strategies during that time [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ... isn't a bad idea either.
CLIENT: Right. Um, yeah, I mean the things that work most is just distractions. I just, when I'm you know in my, so then I'm like feeling like to at least live in a permanent state of distraction (chuckling), 'cause I'd, it is what works the best for me. If I just distract the hell out of myself I feel fine (chuckling).
THERAPIST: What do you think is so anxiety ridden and painful about being alone?
CLIENT: Hmm. Um, I don't know.
THERAPIST: M-hmm. [00:22:55]
CLIENT: I mostly feel like it's being alone, my own just self, not even my own thoughts. My own thoughts don't scare me but it's just my, I don't know. Um, it's so I devel-, it's, it's more I sh-, I guess I should, in those moments I have like, um, when I'm getting really tense, I'll see like, like a big red spot on my cheek and I'll think like where did that come from, what is that, where is, like what is this? And I'll know one, it's that you know the logical part of me is always saying like, it's nothing; you know like you got a spider bite or you got a something. But then you know then there's the part of me that's going like, you have really bad reactions to spider bites, you're whole face could swell (chuckling).
THERAPIST: M-hmm. [00:23:52]
CLIENT: I read this article a few years ago about developing allergies to foods (chuckling), how you can just be eating the food your whole life and then you eat it one day and you have a reaction to it and you, you know. And so I'm tense all the time about like — (whispering) it sounds crazy (softly chuckling) — it sounds actually crazy [when you laugh] (ph).
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Um.
THERAPIST: What sounds crazy about it?
CLIENT: It's a completely irrational fear.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: It's [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: That's if (other chuckling) you're, by definition, is irrational.
CLIENT: Right. Um, so there's you know and there's just, um, so I start going like, but there's like oh, there's tingling (sniffing). I have a constant postnasal drip and so I'm always feeling like, you know I know the throat closing feeling is just part of my anxiety and my anxiety attacks, but I have it all the time (chuckling and sniffing), and that's a sensation that I just can't shake and that's the one that like makes me feel it, it's maddening when I have that sensation of just (big breath) like not being able to get enough air. [00:25:06]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: It makes me crazy (emotional).
THERAPIST: M-hmm. Like you're suffocating?
CLIENT: Exactly.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: So, um, (big breath) yeah, I have a weird like paranoia about not being able to breathe (chuckling and sniffing). And that's basically what it comes out to, is that I do have this, it's all surrounding not being able to breathe. Um, and so that's what happens in those moments, that I start feeling (sniffing), I start feeling really tense and then it inevitably is like you know the "I can't breathe" feeling (sniffing). [00:25:50]
And, um, it never happens when I'm in an argument or when I'm in, it only happens when I'm alone, by myself, but not when I'm like, when I'm crying or when I'm, it's, it's the moment of just by myself, nothing going on. It's not when I'm having an actual problem. It's just me, by myself, with nothing that I just, I just have these sensations of (big breath) like I just feel like something's wrong. I always am just feeling like well something's wrong, and that's the big, I just want to shake it.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But I can't.
THERAPIST: Well I mean I imagine that these feelings that are brought up with your family [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Mm.
THERAPIST: ... are related (chuckling) [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: ... to this experience and especially, well not maybe especially, but the suffocating feeling. [00:26:49]
CLIENT: M-hmm. I just, I don't know. (Big breath) Yeah, I don't know where it is or it, it started for the first time when I'm, when we moved here, um, and I was having panics running the train. The train was make, would make me really tense out, um, just like the crowds and (big breath) I would, that's the first time I ever experienced it.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Um, and then it just got to be more and more common (sniffing). And I was having that, you know that feeling, every night at home with Chris just sitting there watching television or making dinner or anything, to the point where you know that's when, when all this started and when I started to feel like I'm losing it (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, you know and, and so now I recognize that it's — when it first started I, I didn't, I thought like I have to go to the doctor. I must have, I must have s-, like a growth in my throat or I must have something physical wrong with me because this is just, I mean it, it, it feels that real. And, uh, you know over time, eventually I, I ca-, I came to realize it's just a manifestation of my own you know anxiety and, um, but that doesn't make it go away, unfortunately. [00:28:16]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So.
THERAPIST: Well it sounds like there's a feeling look (ph), like not being safe in your own body?
CLIENT: Oh, it's complete, I mean it's, and it's not, it's not trusting myself, too; it's not trusting anything (sniffing). I don't trust, you know I don't trust my own body, I don't trust what I put into it. I don't trust you know my own eyes to tell me that things are okay. (Big breath) So, it's a lot of the trust, I think, even in myself, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: ... which is (whispering) not for the best (chuckle and sniffing). Um, so okay, I think we'll probably have to work on that. [00:29:00]
THERAPIST: That sounds so unsettling.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's not pleasant. It, I mean it's, it, that, uh, it's getting better actually. Um, and, and you know I know that, and that I know that it will get better, but during these overwhelming moments it's like I can't live with this for the rest of my life. I can't feel like this for the rest of my life because I'm, I, I will go crazy then (slight chuckle), but.
THERAPIST: Well why do you feel that you would feel this way the rest of your life?
CLIENT: 'Cause it's been so long now, feeling like this, um, although, like I mean (exhaling audibly) — I don't know. You know I don't know why I feel like that. I, I feel like this is just me now. I feel like this is just part of me, I guess, and, um, I just don't want it to be. [00:30:03]
(Big breath) So, I just I try, I always think like, I always give it a, um, like I always say it's something like — I don't know how to, how to say this — um, I always say like, oh yeah, I feel that way when I'm really hung over or I'll say like, oh, I feel that way on (chuckling), um, if I haven't run in a while or I feel that way, you know like I always give it a, a, I like diagnose it I guess. Um, I feel that way when I'm on my way to work, and I feel that way when I'm just about plum (ph) worried about, and so I give it all these things that are things that I, I could change about it you know. Oh, if I drink, I drank too much coffee. (Big breath) And that is true though sometimes, I do drink too (chuckling) much coffee but (sniffing), um. [00:31:07]
THERAPIST: Well if you've, you know if — what I think you're trying to do is, if you can find a cause then it can be somehow under your control [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Exactly.
THERAPIST: ... and actually do something about the cause.
CLIENT: Right, exactly.
THERAPIST: As opposed to it being like what the hell's going on!
CLIENT: Right. Now what is this, where did it come from and why is it here? So.
THERAPIST: The way you describe your family, it's like [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Mm.
THERAPIST: ... I think of, and especially the way you described it, not even especially, the way you described growing up and then [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: ... now, too, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: ... it's like, in a sense, you're the whistleblower. You're the one [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Oh (ph)
THERAPIST: ... who's saying there's something really wrong here.
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: And then you feel your family saying "no, you're the one who's really wrong, you're the one who's crazy".
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: And it sounds really infuriating and very disorienting, too. [00:31:57]
CLIENT: Yeah, it is. It's, and that's what makes me feel, in the moments that create, you know I feel crazy in those moments. Like all right, I guess I am irrational. I guess I, I am the one that's making it too big of a deal about this. But then, inevitably, some, at some point down the line it all eventually turns into like kind of what I've been saying. So you know, eventually, with my dad, what I, you know I'm saying like we can't be here, we can't. I don't like this. We're all scared. Then we are all scared and he does end up going. And so then it's kind of, it validates the fact that well I was saying that.
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:32:50]
CLIENT: And now you know, so now what? And, um, I don't know, certain things that I do kind of whistle-blow on, that though everybody kind of looks at me like "what the hell", um, eventually do any — and then my siblings say to me all the time "if you don't say it, no one's going to say it", just certain issues that come up in the family. Like you know we all, they have all said that they rely on me to be the one that brings attention to certain problems or issues.
And I am, I'm the oldest and so that does feel like you know kind of my responsibility. But, at the same time, I take it too, I know I take it too far sometimes, making, I need to pick and choose my battles. But, um, but yeah, I do feel a lot of responsibility to, to be the whistleblower (sniffing). But I do want to get to a place where — for a long time I felt like you know this family can be, we can be something that we just aren't, which is a typical family, and we're just so far from it. [00:34:06]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And so I need to let go of the thing, those, those things, and just, um, be more okay with focusing my attention on the things that actually need attention (big breath and clearing throat), so (ph).
THERAPIST: What makes you sad about them?
CLIENT: I think it's something that everyone kind of wants. You know a family that, that all gets along and (big breath), um, you know everyone likes each other and likes spending time together. [00:34:51]
And, um, you know I, I, I just don't, I love all my siblings but a lot of — you know my brother doesn't like to come around 'cause he doesn't really get along with my stepdad, and you know my sister doesn't come aro-, around a lot because you know of issues with the family and, and I just, I think I just wish that everyone could (big breath) be together, but (whispering) no; it just bums me out.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So, yeah. Well that's funny, I haven't thought about that as my role in a very long time (sniffing), not that it's changed, but I just, um, (big breath) I do tend to be the one that's saying, "What the hell's going on here!" (Chuckling and sniffing) Um, so it definitely ruffles some feathers. [00:35:56]
I guess I kind of take that into my life with Chris. I kind of dealt (ph) with that before I have a break, everything has to be picked apart; (chuckling) the poor guy, um, (big breath and sighing) well I definitely do that with Chris (slight chuckle), so. Hmm (sniffing). (Thinking) I wish I could say what I was feeling in those situations without making it a battle.
THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:36:51]
CLIENT: 'Cause sometimes there's things that are an issue. So like — this is a little bit awkward but — um, Chris and I haven't been intimate for a good number of days, 'cause he was away in, in California, and then you know we saw each other at my parents' house but, and so I kind of said something like rude to him last night about it, not rude. But we were going to sleep and I was like, kind of like hinted like "hello, here I am".
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And like be nicer (chuckling), not, not that I was mean about it. And, um, but I don't, I don't even watch — our friends, Emma and Jay, who I talked about, um, we spend a lot of time, the four of us, a lot of time, and, um, so our husbands do things that get under both our skin. And Emma can very delicately say something, like, like a nice joke about like their behavior, um, that's clearly irritating (chuckling) [overlapping voices] [00:38:00]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... to she and I. For me, I'm just harsh, and I'll just say something that's harsh. And a lot of times you know, um, I can play it off like "oh come on, relax". But I, I wish I had a little more subtlety to me, where I don't need to be so like abrupt about it (sniffing). There can be you know a softer way to go about things.
THERAPIST: Do you feel — it sounds like a lot of times when you bring up Chris you feel really guilty about how you treat him?
CLIENT: Yeah, I do I guess. I don't know why. I feel, a lot of times, like I'm nagging him or I'm, um, or I'm just, I feel like just let him be. [00:38:53]
Just like, um, I feel like he's got so much on his plate and I should just be, um, (big breath) [I think] (ph) I should just be there to kind of like support and help him, because what he's doing is working really hard and working really hard to make a life that's going to support us (sniffing). And so I really, I recognize that I'm working really harder now for the two of us, I fully recognize that, but, but, um, I don't know.
I don't know why I feel like that, because I don't think that I treat him — I don't know. There's like, there's just certain — he says a lot, there's this thing that he says as kind of jokey. He says it all the time but it's kind of joking, and he always jokes, "Why don't you like me anymore?" He always says, you know if I say, "What?" You know like I say like "oh, that burp was disgusting" or like something, his immediate response is, "Why don't you like me anymore?" [00:40:09]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And it's, it's not meant to be serious but it feels like why are you saying that all the time?
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Like of course I like you. And so I asked him, I asked him last week to just please stop saying that. I just don't feel like it's a good thing to continue to bring into our relationship, even if it is a joke. But why is he saying that, like where is that coming from? Um, and maybe I'm reading too much into it. [00:40:40]
Um, I do, sometimes I do, I do treat him badly. Sometimes I do take a lot of stuff out on him, and I expect him to give me a lot of allowance for — you know this summer, when things were going on with my dad, I expected that you know you should just understand I'm just going to cry, all the time (chuckling and sniffing). And I expect to just be allowed to just kind of, if I'm going to be mad, I'm going to be mad, and that's just how it's going to be and you have to understand; you've never, you've never experienced this. (Big breath) It's not like, it's not his, and not that I would say those things to him, but that's kind of like how I acted (sniffing). [00:41:23]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And, um, you know I've, I've made dinner and then he wouldn't get what we'd — I make dinner, he does the dishes.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And the dishes won't get done and so I passive aggressively go in there and I start washing all the dishes and I put the, put them away and it's like, um, you know so there's a lot of that going on. And those are things that I'm, I'm trying to just, just stop. I'm just trying to say exactly what I'm feeling, without no loaded (chuckling), nothing loaded. [00:42:01]
THERAPIST: M-hmm. [Well I mean I'm sorry, I need to do] (ph) [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ... more action and I need to stop [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: ... for today. And I wanted to let you know that starting the 12th, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: ... I have that Monday time open for you at 8:30.
CLIENT: Oh great.
THERAPIST: Next week I don't, but I'd like to find a time for us and I can sort of [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Great.
THERAPIST: ... get creative about that.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I know I have a Friday morning time free, would that be a possibility?
CLIENT: Yeah, definitely.
THERAPIST: I think it's 7:30.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Would that work?
CLIENT: So 7:30 to?
THERAPIST: It's 8:15.
CLIENT: So the date you're, okay, uh, good.
THERAPIST: Oh, I need to send you a treatment consent, a treatment contract; did I send you that?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: I don't think so.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Okay, let me send that.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It has like the time and everything on it.
CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling).
THERAPIST: So and I can also like e-mail you a reminder. So next Friday at 7:30, and then after that the Monday [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Monday, great.
THERAPIST: ... 8:30 is your time.
CLIENT: Okay, great.
THERAPIST: Okay?
CLIENT: Thank you so much.
THERAPIST: Ooh!
CLIENT: I need to stop wearing mascara, that's a (other chuckling), that's a bad idea (chuckling).
THERAPIST: M-hmm. [00:42:57]
CLIENT: Okay. Oh, so you'll just send me a statement?
THERAPIST: Oh no, I'll give it to you next time.
CLIENT: Okay, great.
THERAPIST: Okay, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: All right, thanks so much.
THERAPIST: ... take care.
CLIENT: You, too.
THERAPIST: Okay, bye-bye.
CLIENT: Bye. [00:43:22]
