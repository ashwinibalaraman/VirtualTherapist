My parents arrive at the EDC at night, via rental car, after flying
into the Milwaukee airport earlier in the day. I am sitting out front
with Holly, waiting for them to pull up, when they call my cell
phone. They are lost on the hospital grounds and have ended up on
an access road. I'm trying to give my mother directions, despite not
knowing exactly where she is, and I can hear the tension in her voice
over the static of our poor connection.


They pull into the EDC lot in a red car with Iowa plates, and
I think about how I've never been to Iowa. As my parents get out
of the car, I can see that their outfits are color-coordinated. They
always say they don't plan it, but as I grow older I am beginning

We hug and I can tell they are nervous. I'm nervous too. I am
not the daughter they thought I was. I spent an hour before the
bathroom mirror, trying to tame my curly hair and get my makeup
just right. Every outfit I tried on made me feel fat. Finally, I settled
on my favorite jeans and a red short-sleeved shirt.


I introduce them to Holly and we head inside. I show them
the dayroom, where Laura and Eliza are making a fleece blanket.
My mother asks to use the bathroom and is surprised that there is
no lock on the door. I show them the room I share with Laura, and
they say how nice it is.


They have brought me a new cell phone, a pair of black pajama
pants, and a white tank top, both of which are too small. I give them
to Laura.


My mother chats with RC Marie, marveling at her Wisconsin
accent, while my dad and I sign the pass forms so my parents can take
me off the hospital grounds. Once we are in the car, we decide to go to
Pepino's, an Italian restaurant in town. This is the first time I will eat
with my parents since I told them about my eating disorder (I called
them three weeks before I checked myself into the EDC). They order
French silk pie and I order coffee. I savor it, dumping three packets of
Equal into it. My mother tells me I won't sleep tonight, but the luxury
of coffee takes precedence over sleep. When the pie comes, I take one
bite and leave the rest to my parents.

We talk about my grandparents, my brother, and what is going
on in our hometown. We don't talk about the fact that I'm EDNOS
or that I'm in treatment. Therapist Elaine has advised both parties
to keep the conversation light and just enjoy each other's company
this weekend.


After an hour of innocuous conversation, it's time to head
back to the EDC. My parents hug me and tell me goodnight, and
that they'll see me after breakfast the next morning. When I get
back to the EDC, RC Caroline asks me how it went and I tell her
it was fine.


On Saturday morning I call my parents after breakfast. They
pick me up at the EDC, but before we leave I show them the Art
Therapy room. Its walls are covered in residents' artwork, mainly
life-size outlines of how they perceive their bodies. My parents grow
silent as they walk around the quiet room, witnessing the distorted
vision and self-hatred of the eating-disordered. They don't stay long;
it's a hard and somber place. None of my artwork is hanging on the
walls; I have not gotten that far in Art Therapy yet.


We decide to drive to Old World Wisconsin, a tourist attraction
that depicts life in a nineteenth-century Scandinavian settlement
in Wisconsin. It is a bright Midwestern day, and my parents
and I walk from village to village, inspecting farmhouses and learning
how to card wool. I worry that I am losing weight from all the
walking, and that I will get in trouble with Dietitian Caroline.


We eat lunch in the Old World Wisconsin cafeteria, where I
realize I will never be able to accommodate my meal plan. I order a

My dad and I wait outside the cafeteria while my mother uses
the restroom. He tells me I have something hanging out of my nose,
and I tell him it is my nose ring. I can tell he is burning to make a
comment about it, but he doesn't. That would break the easygoing
tone of the weekend.


We spend the rest of the day driving around rural Wisconsin,
and my dad keeps saying it looks just like Pennsylvania. At some
point I fall asleep in the back seat, like I did when I was little. I am
exhausted from my foray into the outside world, and from trying to
keep the peace with my parents.


Later, we stop at Target, where I pick up a few necessities,
and then they drop me off in time for dinner at the EDC. At
some point after waking up from my nap in the back seat, I've
grown anxious and nervous. Back at the EDC, I eat dinner as fast
as possible and sit on the deck with the other residents. I bum a
smoke off Holly, and my hands shake with anxiety and the desire
to purge. When RC Caroline tells us we are going to the movies, I
immediately begin plotting how I will sneak away from the other
women and purge.


The van ride to the cinema is nerve-racking. I tune out the
conversation around me and instead obsess about how many calories
I have already digested. At the cinema, my chance to purge comes
when Eliza wants to get a drink. While we wait in line at the concession
stand, I say I have to use the restroom.

I walk into a stall and purge my dinner. When I come out,
Eliza is none the wiser. After the movie I see my parents walking
out, and that adds to my stress.


That night, I talk to RC Caroline and Cindy about purging,
and RC Caroline has me write a Reasons Not to Purge List.

My parents fly back to Pennsylvania, and I can breathe again. But
something has happened. They have triggered a reaction, an emotional
response, within me, something I don't understand.
