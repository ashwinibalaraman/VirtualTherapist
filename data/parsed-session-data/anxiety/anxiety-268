The trip home was a funny experience. We left the
tropics soon after Easter; the temperature down there was
at times 110 degrees during the last week. For the first ten
days it was damn hot in the wards and then we started
hitting some very cold weather. Again I'm glad you
couldn't see me. For I had traveled all the way from Luzon
with a small musette bag. It was packed in my own inimitable
way. Rest assured, Marion, that I wasn't able to
enjoy the trip. Then too, I knew I was coming back to a
far harder life and a different United States than I'd left
sixteen months ago.


I am trying somehow to plan this coming year; it is extremely
difficult. I know that if there is any hope for further
improvement it will not be through leisure. I've tried too
much of that already in the last three months; the results
haven't quite satisfied me....

24 April 1945.</div>


April, 1945 found me at Letterman General Hospital, San
Francisco, ready to be evacuated to a general hospital in the
Midwest. In moments of relaxation during these years I have
attempted to recall incidents of that trip from Biak to the West
Coast and the subsequent rail travel on a hospital train to
Kennedy General Hospital, at Memphis, Tennessee. Recall is
impossible. This is an illustration of a permanent amnesic gap;

Every mental trick, including simple association and suggestion,
has not aided in breaking into that "memory gap." The
simple devices, which have been successful in shelling out most
memories of the past, have not aided in clearing up this foggy
period. The neurophysiology changes in nerve cells, which are
responsible for indelible memory, have been erased by mental
illness and therapy. I am convinced that no amount of suggestion
of effort will prove successful in the future. The memory
patterns have been unraveled; even a filmy imprint does not
exist from which to bridge the clear-cut whole. I defy the
neurologist or psychiatrist to explain the neurobiological basis
for this vagary of an "amnesia gap." I can explain the reason
but cannot support this reason with scientific proof. This simple
reason for amnesic islets in a foggy sea of forgetfulness will be
undertaken later.


The events of a month are blotted out but the recollections
of my own sickly self-estimation remain. In the hurry of evacuation
from a combat zone it was only possible to render very
necessary medical attention. At the outset of the illness I must
have had either a typhus fever, a Japanese B-encephalitis, or a
virus encephalitis. The central-nervous-system symptoms were
certainly difficult to evaluate. Starting with the original headaches
and delirium, the symptoms toned down to lassitude, apathy,
poor understanding and defective insight and weakness. Confined
to wards with other soldiers with mental illness, it was impossible
to respond to the environment with ordinary humor, restful resignation
and healthy indifference. Confronted by troubled, sick
soldiers who would stare from nowhere when talking with me,
and whose thought was disintegrated, it was reasonable that I
should be puzzled, confused and at times wearily angry with the
world about me. For I was mentally ill and had not the faculty
to sift and judge each wild idea or to accept or reject the windfalls
of opinions, complaints and fuzzy thoughts. It is easy to
understand now the origins of echolalia; add confusion to confusion
or wild thinking to already wild thinking and you have

Reacting in this bizarre way to the world about me, trying
with a sick mind to tolerate a half-wild environment, I received
an army diagnosis of "Psychosis, Unclassified." With a medical
background, acceptance of this diagnosis added to my bewilderment
and anxiety.


The diagnosis haunted me night and day. It was undoubtedly
true, but how did I get that way? Could it have been the heat?
Was it the result of exhaustion or disease? Maybe it was some
latent inherited trait to which I became heir! Shamelessly and
with objectivity I attempted to evaluate my own behavior and
correct my own actions so that I could get into that blessed realm
of normalcy. This attitude of objectiveness was hard to attain; it
required months to acquire this ability. Success and return to
quiet, orderly thinking was impossible in these early months.


I am certain that I continued to be an extrovert at times. When
I was not wallowing in my own muddy thoughts I was talking
with troubled soldiers. There was one red-headed Mormon who
interested me. He had been a medical corpsman and had done
an heroic work in New Guinea. Finally body and brain were
fatigued and his ideation melted into psychotic thinking. I talked
for hours with him. This red-headed friend cast off all personal
responsibility and tossed himself in the lap of his religion. This
was an interesting mechanism of escape from the tiring, fruitless

This was the setting of those May days when I traveled across
the country on a hospital train to the Kennedy General Hospital.
I had returned from duty in the field. Before I could return to
my family and friends I would have to disinherit my mental illness.
Circumstance and organic disease had created an intolerable
situation. I knew that it would take a long time to become
well again.
