BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Susan, how was your week?
PARTICIPANT: (sighs) Uhh, not really good.
THERAPIST: A rough one huh?
PARTICIPANT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. Well, uhm... I think we could get right into the homework which has a lot to do with keeping track of what did occur during the week. Uh, if you could recall I... I... I had given you Panic Log...
PARTICIPANT: Uh huh.
THERAPIST: ...and also you had the Beck Depression and Beck Anxiety Scale so well.
PARTICIPANT: Right.
THERAPIST: Did you get the chance to do that?
PARTICIPANT: Yes. I have.
THERAPIST: Right. Okay can I... take a look?
PARTICIPANT: Do you want them all?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Please. Super. Alright... Okay. Uhm... backing anxieties... Okay... So... uhm... Okay we're up around twenty... twenty... six. Alright that's still pretty high. Uh, oh, I see you scored the Beck Depression In-- inventory alright. (chuckles) Okay, good. That's well. Fine. Okay.
THERAPIST: Ah, okay. Not much depression at all. Good. Okay, same symptoms and let's take a look at this Panic Log. Two wrap in panic attacks, Tuesday. Okay. Uhm, driving home from work, (sniffles) okay. Heart race-heart rate, increased breathing, lightheadedness, fear. Uhmm... the interpretation to these sensations you say you can't breathe and y-- you lost control, what hap-- what happened? Is this in the car?
PARTICIPANT: I had a, an attack in the car and uhm... uhm... I was just driving and uhm... (exhales) I started breathing heavy and uh, and start, my heart begin to race and, and, a-- and I just got hysterical, I just got uh, panicky, I just...
THERAPIST: Hey, wha-- what has gone through your mind? Do you remember?
PARTICIPANT: (exhales) I...
THERAPIST: Wha-- what, what thought went to your mind as you interpreted that panic?
PARTICIPANT: I felt uhm, fear. I was, I was afraid I didn't know what's gonna happen (breaths heavily) and I was just afraid, I was afraid, I was afraid... (cries)
THERAPIST: Right. It's okay. You had written here that y--you you felt like you are losing control.
PARTICIPANT: Right.
THERAPIST: Did you lose control?
PARTICIPANT: No, not really. (clears throat)
THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Are you sure it was a full blown attack? And you actually pulled over the side of the road?
PARTICIPANT: Right.
THERAPIST: What did you do when you're on the side of the road?
PARTICIPANT: Ah, I just, I cried and uh, and I just cried and I got myself together.
THERAPIST: Well, so, when you say you got yourself together, what did you say to yourself? How did you get yourself together?
PARTICIPANT: (exhales) Uhm, I just... I guess I just said I have to get home and uh... and it's important that I got home and... so I just talk myself into (exhales) getting behind the wheel and uh...
THERAPIST: Okay. When-- and then, from that point of driving home, any more attack?
PARTICIPANT: No.
THERAPIST: Okay, good. And on Thursday you were at the... Department Store.
PARTICIPANT: Right.
THERAPIST: Again, I see that the... anxiety attack is up to nine or ten. It was pretty hard, right?
PARTICIPANT: Yeah, it's hard.
THERAPIST: And it seems symptoms. Anythi-- anything different at the D-- Department Store that you experienced than it did in the car? Is that as bad as Tuesday stuff (ph)?
PARTICIPANT: Ahh... (sighs) that was pretty bad too. Uhm, I've gone into business shopping and ah... I was standing at the counter with my uhm, hm... (clears throat) my packages and (sighs) all this things start happening again, my heart started to beat and uhm... ahh... I got (whispers) (inaudible 00:00:51) in my head and it just started, it started all over again, and... (sighs)
THERAPIST: Uh hm.
PARTICIPANT: ...and, I-- I couldn't take it any more. I just-- I just left my things there, just left...
THERAPIST: What about the thoughts? Wa-- what's on your mind?
PARTICIPANT: What?
THERAPIST: What was on your mind? You'd-- you said, you said lost control and you suddenly did get out.
PARTICIPANT: Uhm...
THERAPIST: Did it ever happened?
PARTICIPANT: Yes. Uhh... Well... (sighs) I-- I was afraid and I-- I was afraid, and...
THERAPIST: Okay. But the thoughts I want to your mind was... Yeah... Just... has a trap (ph) of point for you to really... to get pinpoint on exactly what I want.
PARTICIPANT: Did you seems like it's a whole... bunch of things that seems to happen that works (crosstalk) in a minute... heart (soft voice)
THERAPIST: Alright, that's okay because part of the exercise we're gonna be doing next is...
PARTICIPANT: ...is "Out of Breath" exercise...(murmurs)
THERAPIST: Huh?
PARTICIPANT: "Out of Breath" and I... (murmurs)
THERAPIST: "Out of Breath" right. Part of the exercise that what we're gonna do next though is, is for us to get a better hand on those thoughts and emotions and what you're telling yourself and how it contributes to subsequent sensations like being out of breath and so on and so forth. But I see here that, "you're at a store, that it actually run out."
PARTICIPANT: I did.
THERAPIST: Okay. Well, as I explained to you last time, (clears throat). What we're gonna do today is, we're gonna do a little induction exercise. Now, this is a breathing exercise that goes ag--- against actually what you learned on the tape. It's the uh, it's the inverse.
PARTICIPANT: (sighs)
THERAPIST: Yeah. Don't get desperate...
PARTICIPANT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: But it's designed to help us get a little bit of the taste for the sensations that you have. And it'll give us a first hand uhm, account of maybe what's going through your mind and--- and how you respond, okay. And this is uh... you know, in a sense is still on the controlled breathing exercise but it's designed to, to kind of highlight some of these sensations that you experience. And, I want you to know that this is a safe exercise and you know, according to-- to your... the report from Dr. Goldner (ph) and I have spoken with him about the exercise that it's safe for you to do.
PARTICIPANT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Uhm uh... and, what we're gonna do is we're gonna be breathing in a fashion, that, that's, as I said, kind of uh... contradictory to what you've learned on the tape. You will be breathing in and out through your mouth, we're gonna do this for a period of time and shorts to cut our breaths like this... (demonstrates breathing exercise). The significance of this, (clears throat) is that, it's similar to the kind of over-breathing that you do during times that you have an attack. If you remember, you've told me on several occasions that you felt out of breath and your attempt to kind of regain your breathing. You ended up actually... breathing in that fashion. And that's what we're gonna do deliberately today. And I'm gonna start this exercise with you and I'm gonna be watching the clock and... we're probably gonna, go, we'll try to go to it to about a minute, a minute and a half, for as long as you can. But the idea is for you to keep breathing in that fashion as-- as long as you can. Uh, until you can't do that anymore and then we're kind of assess you know what you're experiencing and what you're going through okay?
PARTICIPANT: (breathes) Well (continues breathing), alright?
THERAPIST: Okay, yeah. I know it will...
PARTICIPANT: (breathing)
THERAPIST: You know, it may feel a little apprehensive but uh, again I wanna assure you this...
PARTICIPANT: This is going to be like a, seem like a real panic attack?
THERAPIST: Uhh... probably not to the same height but it will give us a little bit of a, a clue into you know what... what are some of the initial thoughts and reactions that you have, okay?
PARTICIPANT: Okay. But I, I, I really don't like it...
THERAPIST: Yeah, I know. I know and it's-- it's uh, I know that's-- that's kind of a, uh... common response. Uhm... again you know you don't have to do this. I mean we can take a look at the (crosstalk)....
PARTICIPANT: (crosstalk) No. I, I want to do it. I wanna, I wanna do it.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Okay. Well, let's-- let's give it a try. Now you-- if your mouth gets a little dry, have a glass of water over there for yourself. Feel free to use that at the, at the end. But, try again to push yourself as much as you can, okay? And then, right after we're gonna be talking about the symptoms you experienced, what was going through your mind as a response. And then, we're probably do a little bit of the controlled breathing exercises that help deescalate that, okay? And then we'll talk about it.
PARTICIPANT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Alright, any questions?
PARTICIPANT: No. I have none right now.
THERAPIST: Great. Alright, so let's begin. Uhm... what I'd like to do is when uh, I say go, let's begin to do this together, breathing in and out through our mouth and we'll stick on that tight fashion, okay?
PARTICIPANT: Mmm..
THERAPIST: Ready? Alright let's begin.
PARTICIPANT: (inhales-exhales)
THERAPIST: Okay! Keep up.
PARTICIPANT: (continues breathing)
THERAPIST: Keep down... That's it. You're coming up to about... a minute now.
PARTICIPANT: (breathing continues) Hah! (pants)
THERAPIST: Okay. What's, what's going on?
PARTICIPANT: (pants continuously)
THERAPIST: So, talk to me. Tell me what's going on?
PARTICIPANT: My heart... (still panting)
THERAPIST: Okay. What about, what's going on with your heart?
PARTICIPANT: It's beating and... (still panting)
THERAPIST: What's go- what's going through your mind?
PARTICIPANT: ...and I can't breathe. (panting)
THERAPIST: Right.
PARTICIPANT: There's not enough air. (panting)
THERAPIST: Okay. Alright.
PARTICIPANT: (breathes heavily)
THERAPIST: Anything else?
PARTICIPANT: (sighs) (breathes heavily) Well I feel tingling and arms... my arms are... weaken. (panting) My hands are shaking and...
THERAPIST: Uh huh. What's going through your mind by now?
PARTICIPANT: Uhm, uhm (panting) hearing it's so fuzzy.
THERAPIST: Fuzzy?
PARTICIPANT: (sighs)
THERAPIST: Okay. Now...
THERAPIST: Just relax. Just relax (participant breathes heavily) a--and tell me real quick now what's, what's going through your mind?
PARTICIPANT: Uhm, well my heart uh, (breathes heavily) my heart's speeding...(crosstalk)
THERAPIST: (crosstalk) Alright...
PARTICIPANT: ...and it's racing...(crosstalk)
THERAPIST: (crosstalk) Okay.
PARTICIPANT: ...and uhm... uhm I--I feel like I'm short of breath.
THERAPIST: ...breath (speaks in a low voice)
PARTICIPANT: And, my arms feel really weak and... tingling and... sweaty and uh...
THERAPIST: Okay.
PARTICIPANT: (breathes heavily) tre--trembling... (crosstalk)
THERAPIST: (crosstalk) Anything else?
PARTICIPANT: I--I just feel like I'm trembling and...
THERAPIST: Trembling. Okay. What's, what was going through your mind at the po-- time that your heart raced ready to go up?
PARTICIPANT: I thought, "Oh no! It's starting, it's starting"... (crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Okay. It's starting. And... what was the reaction in this?
PARTICIPANT: Panic. Uhm.
THERAPIST: Okay. A--anything else?
PARTICIPANT: Uhm, just- I was afraid, I was panicking.
THERAPIST: Okay. Fear, panic. And then you're, y--yo--you had difficulty breathing...
PARTICIPANT: Uhmm.
THERAPIST: ...you said your...
PARTICIPANT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...hands. And what was going through your mind at that point?
PARTICIPANT: Uhm... Ah, well I wasn't getting enough air and I was...
THERAPIST: Okay.
PARTICIPANT: ...not getting enough air. (breaths heavily)
THERAPIST: Anything else?
PARTICIPANT: No. That I just wanted to, I feel like I have to leave it. It's almost like this feeling I had at the store.
THERAPIST: Okay, "I have to leave." Okay, and then you said you had a shakiness and... (crosstalk)
PARTICIPANT: (crosstalk) Shakiness...
THERAPIST: (crosstalk)...a weakness.
PARTICIPANT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Uh, what uh, went through your mind?
PARTICIPANT: Uh, (breaths heavily) That uh, I'm... it's gonna start, it's gonna start.
THERAPIST: Okay. What's gonna start?
PARTICIPANT: All these attacks.
THERAPIST: And, the reaction you had at that point?
PARTICIPANT: Just panic, uh like I didn't want it to do, I didn't want it to happen.
THERAPIST: Again, uh, we had a heart rate, your initial response was automatic thought of "Oh my God!" or "No, oh no!" I think you said, "It's starting fear and panic." You started to have the shakiness, or the difficulty in breathing, then not getting enough air. What did that feel like to you when you were not getting enough air? That-- the-- does that really what pushed you over the edge?
PARTICIPANT: Uh, like almost, like suffocating.
THERAPIST: Suffocating, okay. And of course that...
PARTICIPANT: And I couldn't get enough air.
THERAPIST: So, that elicited the alarm of real panic at that point?
PARTICIPANT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. And then your shakiness and the sha-- and the weak, trembling feeling? And going through uh, you're worried about it's going to start?
PARTICIPANT: Right. Right. (crosstalk)
THERAPIST: (crosstalk) It being that big cycle of panic, that overwhelming fear...
PARTICIPANT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...and you don't want it to start.
PARTICIPANT: No.
THERAPIST: Okay, good. Alright very good. Now, I'd like to, I'd like to try it again if we can just a little bit, I know, I know, (participant sighs) but just uh, I wanna make sure that we're... we're getting all of the... thoughts and the emotions that are going on with you. And the real sense of exactly what you're telling yourself in terms of the interpretation.
PARTICIPANT: Alright.
THERAPIST: Okay? Do you want to take a drink of water and we'll try it again? Okay, good. Alright. You will, we'll do it again about the sa-- about the same little time, okay?
PARTICIPANT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Alright. Uhm... ready? Begin.
PARTICIPANT: (inhales-exhales)
THERAPIST: Good! Okay, keep going.
PARTICIPANT: (continues breathing exercise)
THERAPIST: That's okay, stop.
PARTICIPANT: (panting)
THERAPIST: Okay. Okay, stop! Stop! Look at me... Susan... Look at me...
PARTICIPANT: (panting deeply)
THERAPIST: Susan, look at me... Susan? What's going on? Tell me what's going on?
PARTICIPANT: (panting) (cries) It's happening.
THERAPIST: Ah-uh what's... What's going on? (crosstalk)
PARTICIPANT: It's st-- it's starting to happen again (cries).
THERAPIST: Alright. Alright S- Susan, Susan look at me. Breath through your nose, close your eyes (demonstrates breathing) slow through your nose, exhale through your mouth. (demonstration continues)
PARTICIPANT: (pants and cries continuously)
THERAPIST: Try to concentrate on what I'm telling you to do. Through your nose, deep-- deep through your nose, exhale through your mouth...
PARTICIPANT: (follows instruction)
THERAPIST: Deep through your nose. Try to go slow through your mouth.
PARTICIPANT: (continues breathing)
THERAPIST: That's it. slow...
PARTICIPANT: (breathes in relief)
THERAPIST: Okay, let's focus again on the piston.
PARTICIPANT: (inhales-exhales)
THERAPIST: That's it. Just imagine, your heart rate and your respiration like a piston. And it's been going real fast and now we're gonna slow it down gently. Just take a deep breath. Exhale through the mouth, slowly continuously and let's just bring all those functions calm down. Let them all calm down. Exhale, go real slow, real slow. Take a deep breath.
PARTICIPANT: (inhales deeply)
THERAPIST: Real slow, whistle.
PARTICIPANT: (exhales deeply)
THERAPIST: That's it, very good. (participant inhales) Exhale... 
PARTICIPANT: (exhales deeply)
THERAPIST: Okay.
COUNCELOR: Alright. Yeah. Before relax 'till I say, "Look at me. Tell me what was going on. Did you get really upset there a little bit? (breathes heavily) Wa- wa- what was king-- what was freaking out?"
PARTICIPANT: It is happening as an attack.
THERAPIST: What? What was going on?
PARTICIPANT: Well, I couldn't breathe, I couldn't get enough air...
THERAPIST: Uh hm.
PARTICIPANT: And uh, my heart started to raise and...
THERAPIST: Uh hm.
PARTICIPANT: And I felt like uh, I could panic. (whispers)
THERAPIST: Okay. Alright. Alright. It was coffee huh? What was the frightening thing about the sensations that you're experiencing?
PARTICIPANT: (sighs) Alright. (whispers) Mean the symptoms?
THERAPIST: Uh hm.
PARTICIPANT: Again, same. Uhm...
THERAPIST: What were you telling yourself?
PARTICIPANT: I was telling myself that, "It's gonna happen, it's gonna happen", it's happening.
THERAPIST: Okay, and tha-, and that means what?
PARTICIPANT: That means I'm gonna have an attack.
THERAPIST: And?
PARTICIPANT: And I was afraid, I was afraid.
THERAPIST: Okay, but nothing on the atta--, other than that catastrophic, that was gonna die or was gonna lose control?
PARTICIPANT: (breathes) Maybe lose control. (crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yeah. (soft voice)
PARTICIPANT: I know I wasn't gonna die.
THERAPIST: Okay. So, the worst thought that you had was, "...and I lose control."
PARTICIPANT: Uh hm.
THERAPIST: You didn't?
PARTICIPANT: No.
THERAPIST: Okay. We wanna keep that in mind because one of the things that we wanna begin to do is to reprogram your thinking, about what exactly these sensations do. There's kind of like an anticipation of what it's going to do, and you never does that. I mean, i...it never really goes beyond the point of view to extricate yourself from the situation of feeling like you need to li-, to live. Fact of the matter is, of all the i...information that we've gathered so far, you've never truly lost control. You've always responded to any anticipation of losing control.
PARTICIPANT: Right.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
PARTICIPANT: That's true. (whispers)
THERAPIST: But if you look at the end result, it's nothing other than autonomic activity. That number one, is limited and benign in the sense that it- it- it's short term and it doesn't really hurt you, and you need to begin to think about it in that malfunction as we begin to go over this, and the structure in our head, exactly what it does to us. Now, heart rate increase, difficulty in breathing, uh... a lot of what you tell yourself, makes the difference in terms of how worse you get and the worse you gets actually the end result isn't really as terrible as you anticipate it today.
PARTICIPANT: Right. (crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, see how quickly we brought it down when we tested a little control breathing?
PARTICIPANT: Right.
THERAPIST: 'kay. That's also the tool that we're gonna begin to use but a lot sooner in the panic sequence, when that-, the idea is that, never let it get that in depths. Okay, so get it early.
PARTICIPANT: So, barely when the breathing starts and the panic onset like that if you just practice control breathing?
THERAPIST: And control breathing and-, and restructuring your interpretation is a bodily symptoms. For example, instead of saying, "Oh, no it's starting. I'm-, I'm-, I'm not getting enough air", well, we'll come up with some restructured response collaborative words between the two of this like, "Okay. I have a little increase heart rate and I'm having some difficulty in breathing, but this may not be-, nothing more than just a little stress period." Just take a deep breath. Close your eyes. Take it inhale, exhale slowly, bring it down and you see how curtaili- curtailing the symptoms and the sensations actually assert to- to what uh, desolates the attack. Now, what you have to do is-, is a homework assignment. I'd like you to continue to uh, fill out the "panic log" as you had been. But also, I would like you to try this exercise at home. Not, to the extent that-, that you've done it in here. But just a little bit of over breathing, okay? A little bit of e-, escalation till you get-, till you get the heart rate in- up and the respiration going a little bit and then do the breathing retraining as I just taught you and- and as the tape re- reinforces, to bring that down a little bit. Uhm, 'kay. It just kinda, will it go up or will it gonna go down, alright? And, most importantly too uh, we'll talk a little bit about, uhm, how to restructure you-, your thinking with regard to this entire uhm... uh... sequence of panic. For example, the automatic thought which is we had said before was "Oh, no, it's starting again. I'm not getting enough air" and so on and so forth. I want you to think about this week, what would be some alternative responses to that, now that you know that this really isn't as deadly as you anticipate it to be. Okay, so do you understand how the principle works? It's a combination of restructuring your thinking and de-escalating by the breathing, to brings that down. (sighs) The idea is that, when you feel the trigger symptoms coming on, early you do that and you stay it off. You cut-, and head it off to the pit (ph).
PARTICIPANT: I can see how that... (crosstalk) it work.
THERAPIST: Alright. Well, it's very effective. I remember what you-, what I taught you to do is-, is competitive with a state of anxiety and-, and panic. So, you-, you're using something that's- that's not allowing it to escalate. You're using-, control breathing and relaxing, the way it is kind of... pulled it down.
PARTICIPANT: Uh hm. Okay. (soft voice)
THERAPIST: And that combine with the thinking, is what we'll, but we-, but is what we really needed, Okay?
PARTICIPANT: Okay.
