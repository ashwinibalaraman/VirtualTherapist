<font size="4"><b>Behavioral Gerontology</b></font>

<b>DESCRIPTION OF STRATEGY</b>


Behavioral gerontology is the application of behavioral
principles to the problems of older adults. Though
considerable work in behavioral gerontology has
addressed basic research questions (e.g., the nature
of dependency among nursing home residents, extent
of new learning among Alzheimer's patients), most
efforts in behavioral gerontology have focused on
behavioral assessment, behavioral intervention, and a
combination of the two. Behavioral gerontology began
in the 1960s and early 1970s, with work by individuals
such as Cautela, Hoyer, Lindsley, Risley, Baltes, and
Pinkston. Though the same principles of behavior
are applied to older adults as to younger adults and
children, problems addressed with older adults are typically
more complex and often unique to older adults.
This is particularly the case with older adults who have
experienced physical and cognitive decline.


<b>RESEARCH BASIS</b>


A moderate amount of research has been conducted
in behavioral geronotology, though many questions
remain unanswered. Research areas, target problems,
and interventions will be discussed by problem area,
with an emphasis on clinical gerontology.


<b>SELF-CARE</b>


Self-care behaviors, including feeding/eating, ambulating,
and maintaining personal hygiene may drop
from an older adult's behavioral repertoire as a result
of the progression of a disease or health problem or
simply because these behaviors are no longer reinforced
by environmental contingencies. Several studies
have demonstrated the effectiveness of employing
contingent positive reinforcement (e.g., praise) for
eating combined with a time-out procedure for food
refusal. Other interventions have incorporated prompting
and praise for ambulation independent of a wheelchair
and/or reinforcement for distance walked.
Employment of token economies has proven effective
as a method for reinforcing performance of personal
hygiene tasks, including bathing, toileting, and oral
hygiene. In addition to interventions based on reinforcement
of the self-care behavior, other successful
interventions have emphasized skills training involving
instruction, modeling, and behavioral rehearsal.


<b>SOCIAL BEHAVIOR</b>


<b>Social Skills</b>


As opportunities for social interaction (e.g., job,
school) decrease with age, older adults may find it difficult
to interact socially and, as a result, lose social
skills that were once a part of their behavioral repertoires.
Social withdrawal is also common in older
adults due to restraints in mobility or loss of friends
and loved ones. Social skills training is a behavioral
intervention that involves instruction, modeling of
social behavior, behavioral rehearsal or role playing,
feedback, and reinforcement of social interaction.
Several studies have demonstrated that through social
skills training, community-dwelling and institutionalized
older adults were able to develop or fine-tune
interpersonal skills that enhanced the quality and
frequency of interactions with others.


<b>Dependency</b>


Older adults, especially those in nursing homes or
institutional settings, must frequently rely on others

[p. <i>111</i>]

<b>MEMORY AND COGNITION</b>


The aging process is typically associated with decrements
in a variety of cognitive abilities. Older adults
frequently experience losses in short-term memory,
response speed, and ability to learn new information.
However, such declines are generally minimal, vary
greatly between individuals, and typically do not
impact everyday functioning.


Behavioral principles and procedures have been
used in attempts to remediate age-related declines
in cognitive abilities. Positive reinforcement may be
provided for correct responses to improve response
speed, accuracy, and risk taking in testing situations.
Similarly, modeling strategies have been effective at
improving the test-taking performance of older adults.
Models may be used to teach older adults effective
methods for problem solving, reasoning, and concept
formation. Shaping and token economies have also
been identified as methods for improving older adults'
performance on tests of fluid intelligence.


Reduction of anxiety experienced by older adults in
testtaking situations has shown improved performance.
For example, highly anxious older adults typically benefit
from training in progressive muscle relaxation or
stress inoculation prior to memory training.


Cognitive losses associated with organic conditions,
such as dementia, may also be amenable to
intervention. Imagery techniques for learning words
and faces can be effective among older adults with
dementia, although the longevity of gains is uncertain.
Similarly, spaced retrieval techniques, in which
acquired information is repeatedly retrieved at intervals
of increasing duration, have been effective at teaching
new information and skills to older adults with dementia.
Older adults with dementia have been shown to
benefit from carrying diaries or wallets with relevant
personal information that can be consulted in situations
where the information is forgotten.


<b>BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE AND AGING</b>


Behavioral principles and procedures have been effectively
applied to the field of gerontological health
psychology and behavioral medicine. For example,
behavioral interventions have been successful in treating
pain, insomnia, and incontinence in older adults.


<b>Pain</b>


Although treatment of persistent pain in older
adults typically relies extensively on pharmacological
interventions, behavioral interventions offer promising
results. Older adults may be particularly susceptible
to the reinforcing consequences of pain behaviors,
such as grimacing or talking about pain, because these
individuals tend to be more isolated and lonely than
younger adults. Pain behaviors may be used by older
adults to solicit attention and sympathy. Thus, behavioral
interventions that provide reinforcement for
healthy behaviors and extinction of pain behaviors can
be effective at improving activity level, medication
intake, pain behaviors, and self-report of pain.


Cognitive-behavioral therapy, involving instruction
in techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation,
deep breathing, imagery, cognitive restructuring, and
problem solving, has been shown to be equally as effective
for younger and older pain patients. Specifically,
cognitive-behavioral interventions may effectively
reduce self-reports of pain, anxiety, depression, medication
use, and pain impact. Biofeedback has also been
shown to be effective at reducing pain in older adults.


<b>Insomnia</b>


Poor sleep quality and complaints of insomnia are
particularly prevalent in aging individuals. Behavioral
interventions for insomnia are highly effective with
older adults. Many effective behavioral treatments
include training in stimulus control, in which older
adults are trained to establish regular sleep schedules

[p. <i>112</i>]

<b>Incontinence</b>


Incontinence is a significant problem in both community-dwelling
and institutionalized older adults. In
addition to an elevated risk of physical complications,
incontinence can lead to psychological distress, including
embarrassment and anxiety. Incontinence also
ranks as one of the leading causes of admission to
long-term care facilities. Early treatments for incontinence
were aimed at institutional caregivers; nursing
staff were trained to implement ongoing behavioral
management procedures. Treatments often involved
positive reinforcement for dry checks and toileting
requests, social disapproval for wetness, and frequent
toileting. However, success of such efforts was often
limited due to staff turnover, shortages of nurses, and
high patient-staff ratios.


Recent behavioral interventions for incontinence
have focused on operant conditioning of physiological
responses, such as selective contraction of pelvic floor
muscles and voluntary inhibition of detrusor contraction,
which mediate bladder control. Alone and in
combination with scheduled voiding techniques, the
effectiveness of biofeedback training has been well
documented in incontinent community-living older
adults.


<b>PSYCHOPATHOLOGY</b>


<b>Anxiety</b>


Prevalence of anxiety disorders in adults appears
to decrease with age. However, recent research has
demonstrated that subthreshold anxiety, or a preponderance
of anxiety-related symptoms that do not meet
diagnostic criteria, is quite common and may prove
functionally disabling for many older adults. The
sparse behavioral intervention research that exists
with older adults has focused mainly on generalized
anxiety disorder; a few studies have examined behavioral
interventions for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
From research that exists, it appears that traditional
behavioral interventions for anxiety used with younger
adults are efficacious for older cohorts as well. These
interventions typically include progressive muscle
relaxation, exposure to the anxiety-provoking stimulus,
differential reinforcement of "other" behaviors
that are incompatible with the anxious behavior/response,
response prevention, systematic desensitization,
or a combination of these. Further work is much
needed to identify effective forms of treatment for the
entire spectrum of anxiety disorders as well as sub-threshold
anxiety in older adults.


<b>Depression</b>


Depression is the most prevalent psychological disorder
among older adults. Effective behavioral interventions
for depression in older adults typically occur
through individual or group psychotherapy. Individual
behavior therapy is based on the premise that behavior
and mood are linked and when one's positive
behavioral experiences increase, mood will improve.
As such, most therapies incorporate social reinforcement
for increased activity, and the therapist and
client may work together to schedule pleasant or
enjoyable events into the client's daily schedule.
Group therapies are especially effective for older
adults, because by the nature of the therapy, loneliness
is countered. Indeed, loneliness is a frequent contributing
factor to depression. Group therapy takes a
psychoeducational approach, with emphasis again on
scheduling pleasant activities into the depressed older
adult's life. In addition, group members serve as a
means of social support and may also aid in decreasing
the stigma associated with seeking therapy.


<b>Paranoia</b>


Paranoia is a common psychological problem
among older adults, especially for those who suffer
from dementia or experience some form of sensory
impairment (e.g., blindness, deafness). Research on
behavioral interventions for paranoia is largely nonexistent.
However, several case studies have demonstrated
its potential effectiveness. These studies

[p. <i>113</i>]

<b>DEMENTIA</b>


Many older adults with dementia exhibit behavior
problems, which sometimes vary according to the
stage of dementia. Behaviors that are most typically
problematic from the perspective of individuals with
dementia, their caregivers, and others in the living
environment are wandering, disruptive vocalizations,
and aggressive behaviors. Several studies have demonstrated
effectiveness of behavioral approaches for the
assessment and treatment of these problem behaviors.


<b>Wandering</b>


There is little agreement on a definition of wandering,
but most conceptualizations include the presence
of cognitive impairment and movement through large-scale
space. Wandering can constitute a significant
problem for caregivers of cognitively impaired older
adults. It also represents a potential risk for the
impaired older adult who may suffer a fall or become
lost in a community, with death as a potential consequence.
Cognitively impaired older adults also can
become lost in nursing homes or wander in and out of
the rooms of other residents, who can become combative
when such "strangers" invade their personal
space. Several behavioral interventions have been successful
with wanderers. Interventions have included,
for example, reinforcing behavior that is incompatible
with wandering, posting visual cues that previously
had been paired with reinforcement or punishment to
reinforce appropriate behavior and punish undesirable
behavior, and altering the stimulus properties of the
environment associated with wandering. In the latter
case, for example, one might disguise a door through
which someone wanders by placing a poster over the
door so that it no longer is associated with exit behavior.
Systematic research is sparse, but several case
studies have shown promising results.


<b>Disruptive Vocalizations</b>


Verbally disruptive behaviors are vocal behaviors
that are disruptive, repetitive, or inappropriate to the
circumstances. This is a common problem among
older adults with Alzheimer's disease and is often
manifested as shouting, screaming, or moaning. The
behaviors are disruptive to caregivers and others in the
proximity of the older adult. Behavioral interventions
have included, for example, positive reinforcement
contingent on absence of disruptive vocalizations,
time-out for vocalizations, exposure to music, exposure
to a family-generated videotape, one-to-one
social interactions, ignoring of vocalizations, social
skills training, and relaxation training. Most research
has been in the form of case studies, although a few
group studies also have demonstrated the effectiveness
of behavioral interventions. No single intervention
has been found effective, with some authors
suggesting the need to carefully match treatment to
vocalizer.


<b>Aggressive Behavior</b>


Aggressive behavior is common among older
adults with dementia and often occurs when caregivers
are attempting to provide care or when dementia
patients are in the presence of other dementia
patients whose behavior is disturbing. A variety of
behavioral interventions have been used effectively,
including, for example, altering antecedent conditions,
altering consequences of aggressive behavior,
and differential reinforcement of incompatible
behaviors. As with interventions for other problem
behaviors, no single approach is effective with all
aggressive behaviors. Most of the research has consisted
of case studies, with the more effective ones
using an initial functional assessment to guide the
intervention development and implementation.


<b>COMPLICATIONS</b>


Most of the complications of applying a behavioral
approach to the problems of older adults stem from the
complexity of many possible controlling variables that
are more common with older than younger adults. For
example, older adults are more likely than younger
adults to experience chronic illnesses, experience limitations
due to the illnesses, take multiple medications
for these illnesses, experience adverse effects of the
medications and their interactions, and have significant
sensory impairments that complicate the assessment
and intervention processes. For older adults with
cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), the

<b>CASE ILLUSTRATION</b>


"Mr. Adams" was an 85-year-old man with moderate
dementia who was recently admitted to a nursing home.
Nursing staff noted that he became aggressive when
staff members attempted to bathe him. This did not happen
consistently. Mr. Adams was in a wheelchair, and
he was incapable of communicating effectively due to
expressive aphasia. A functional assessment accomplished
through direct observation of Mr. Adams's care
revealed that his combative behavior diminished in frequency
and intensity as he was withdrawn from the
bathtub, and further upon being dried. Several initial
hypotheses were generated through systematic observations
regarding the possible function of the aggressive
behavior. First, aggressive behavior could have
been emitted to escape water that was too cold. Second,
aggressive behavior could have been directed at the
person performing the bathing because that person
looked like someone disliked by Mr. Adams. Third,
Mr. Adams could have been using aggressive behavior
to escape the bath because he was embarrassed having
an opposite-sexed person bathing him. To test the first
hypothesis, the water temperature was increased to
two different levels, which produced no change in
aggressive behavior. The second hypothesis was judged
unlikely, since Mr. Adams was aggressive with
several different bathers. To test the third hypothesis,
Mr. Adams was first bathed by a woman and then by
a man. No aggressive behavior occurred with the
man. Another woman and another man each bathed
Mr. Adams, and again no aggressive behavior occurred
with the man. From then on, only men bathed Mr. Adams,
and no further aggressive behavior was observed.
