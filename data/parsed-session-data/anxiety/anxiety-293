<b>June 29</b>

Today was the first day in a year or more that I have felt
normal. Since my skin, my sense of anticipation, and everything
else of import seemed O.K. However, I did not sleep O.K., and
in the morning, my state was back to "square."


<i>Yesterday I drank briefly from an oasis of absolute heaven,
situated in the midst of a desert of absolute hell and aridity
stretching for an eternity</i>. Just for a brief second of time, I
thought that I may have been released from my sentence and have
managed a marvellous "metamorphosis." Seemingly, it is not to
be so, however, for, the following day, my daytime nightmare
was in full swing again. Nevertheless, it might have been an
augury of future events, for all I know.
