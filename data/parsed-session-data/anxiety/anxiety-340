[p. <i>275</i>]

<b>Abstract</b>: The metabolic syndrome should be approached as an entity because diabetes, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and obesity share common etiological, physiological, and psychological factors. The
practitioner treating patients with this syndrome should consider that inactivity and overeating,
superimposed on genetic predisposition, form a cascade of metabolic events leading to overt disease.
Psychological and social factors have an impact on etiology and maintenance of the disorder.
Medical, psychophysiological therapies, and lifestyle modifications are best combined to achieve
positive outcomes.

<b>Introduction to the Metabolic Syndrome</b>

An epidemic rages at a staggering pace, for
the first time unrelated to infectious or toxic
agents. The comorbid conditions of abdominal
obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension,
and hyperlipidemia have their roots in evolutionarily
and genetically determined inactivity
and hedonistic appetites. Once present,
the components of this deadly quartet, now
termed the metabolic syndrome, confer significant
risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
disease (Bouchard, 1995;
Pi-Sunyer, Laferrere, Aronne, &amp; Bray, 1999;
Zimmet, McCarty, &amp; de Courten, 1997).


The apparent behavioral basis of the metabolic
syndrome makes it, on the surface, well
suited to nonpharmacological intervention.
However, two factors make it difficult to
design programs that are acceptable to
patients: (1) Fatigue and lassitude are the
only overt symptoms, and (2) successful
treatment depends on patient compliance.
Therefore, many practitioners avoid nonpharmacological
approaches.


We have chosen to focus on the metabolic
syndrome (including type 2 diabetes) at the
expense of its less common metabolic relatives.
Primary care of patients with type 1
diabetes (formerly called insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus) or gestational diabetes is
best assigned to subspecialists in diabetology
with support by a team of nurse-educators,
dietitians, exercise physiologists, social
workers, and psychologists. Issues facing

<b>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</b>

<i><b>Definition and Diagnosis</b></i>


Diabetes mellitus is a state characterized
by hyperglycemia. Seemingly simple, the
diagnosis of diabetes is confounded by the
definition of hyperglycemia and the variability
of human physiology. The level of blood
glucose that defines diabetes has been
debated and modified through three major
consensus efforts in the last 25 years (Expert
Committee, 1997). Significant hyperglycemia
predicts pathology, but even minimal
elevations in blood glucose have been associated
with pancreatic islet dysfunction
(Bourey et al., 1993) and vascular disease
(Barrett-Connor, Wingard, Criqui, &amp;
Suarez, 1984; Haffner, 1998; Mykkanen,
Laakso, Penttila, &amp; Pyorala, 1991; Stamler
et al., 1979; Yeap, Russo, Fraser, Wittert, &amp;
Horowitz, 1996).


Type 2 diabetes is associated with insulin
resistance and defective insulin secretion.
Although previously referred to as noninsulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus, most
patients require insulin within five years of
diagnosis. The term <i>adult-onset diabetes</i>
implies another characteristic of this disease
that is no longer pathognomonic. Not only
do more than 10 percent of adult-onset diabetics
demonstrate a typical autoimmune-mediated
response similar to type 1 at onset
of the disease (Tuomi, Carlsson, et al., 1999;
Tuomi, Group, et al., 1993), but type 2 diabetes
is occurring more frequently in children
and adolescents (Ledermann, 1995; Lehto
et al., 1997).


Table 20.1 shows the diagnostic criteria
for type 2 diabetes recently adopted by the
American Diabetes Association (2001).


<i><b>Prevalence</b></i>


The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (1998) estimate that about 6 percent
of the population, or 15.7 million people,
have diabetes, with 800,000 new cases
diagnosed each year. Prevalence increases
with age, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
Type 2 diabetes tends to run in
families, but research has yet to produce a
common gene for susceptibility. The phenotype
seems dependent on a particular environment
and lifestyle, so diabetes does not
usually occur in the absence of a sedentary
lifestyle and easily available food. Perhaps the
most striking example is that of the Pima
Indians of Arizona. This group exhibits a
prevalence of diabetes in middle-aged persons
of 54 percent (men) and 37 percent (women)
compared with their poorer relatives who
scratch out an agrarian existence in the Sierra
Madre Mountains of Mexico and carry only
6 percent and 11 percent prevalence, respectively
(Ravussin, Valencia, Esparza, Bennett,
&amp; Schulz, 1994). Therefore, type 2 diabetes
appears to arise as a consequence of behavioral
patterns superimposed on a permissive
genetic state and should be considered both
preventable and, at least in its early stages,
treatable by behavioral therapies.

<b>Essential Hypertension</b>

<i><b>Definition and Diagnosis</b></i>


A person suffering from hypertension is
defined as having a "systolic blood pressure
of 140 mm Hg or greater, diastolic blood
pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater, or taking
antihypertensive medication" (Joint National
Committee, 1997). These seemingly arbitrary
values were decided through several
national consensus conferences weighing the
data correlating blood pressure with the risk
of end-organ damage over time. Thus the

[p. <i>277</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284025-I025&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Most hypertension runs in families and
occurs without obvious etiology so is termed
<i>essential hypertension (EHT)</i>, and indeed the
name may be quite appropriate. Mechanisms
to generate high blood pressure may confer
evolutionary advantage in the face of either
salt deprivation or massive blood loss and
trauma (Neel, Weder, &amp; Julius, 1998). The
resultant high blood pressure may truly have
been "essential" to survival and distinguishes
EHT from the more uncommon hormonal
causes of high blood pressure.


<i><b>Prevalence</b></i>


Approximately 50 million Americans
have sustained, elevated blood pressure (Burt
et al., 1995). Although hypertension occurs
in all races, special attention has been
directed to the increased prevalence in
African American men who demonstrate an
earlier onset and more rapid rate of development
of stage 3 hypertension (Joint National
Committee, 1997).

<b>Hyperlipidemia</b>

<i><b>Definition and Diagnosis</b></i>


Until recently, population statistics were
used to define normal cholesterol content as
in the 250 to 300 mg/dL range. It is now recognized
that those levels will, over the course
of a lifetime, result in cholesterol accumulation
in deposits in unwanted places like arterial
walls. So, the term <i>desirable</i> cholesterol
level has largely replaced the word (and
the statistical concept of) <i>normal</i>. Hyperlipidemia
is now defined as blood lipid levels
that are not desirable. High total serum
cholesterol is defined as levels greater than
240 mg/dL, which corresponds to the 80th
percentile of the U.S. population (Expert
Panel, 1993). The term <i>hyperlipidemia</i> subsumes
all blood lipids, including cholesterol-carrying
subtypes and triglycerides. Current
recommendations derive from data on the
association of calculated low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) with heart disease. Table 20.2
summarizes the dietary and drug therapy of
hyperlipidemia. Considering that the calculation
of LDL also involves total cholesterol as
well as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and
triglycerides, a simple definition of <i>hyperlipidemia</i>
escapes us.


The definition of hyperlipidemia requiring
pharmacotherapy has been tailored for
groups with other associated risk factors for
heart disease, such as family history of coronary
heart disease, tobacco use, hypertension,
and diabetes mellitus (Expert Panel,
1993). Once hyperlipidemia is identified, a
search should proceed for possible exacerbating
conditions. These include diabetes,
hypothyroidism, and excessive alcohol use,
as well as common medications such as
estrogens and beta blockers. For individuals
with diabetes, recommended levels are LDL

[p. <i>278</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284025-I026&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<i><b>Prevalence</b></i>


Due to ongoing changes in definition, true
prevalence data for hyperlipidemia is difficult
to obtain. If <i>hypercholesterolemia</i> is defined
by values greater than 240 mg/dL, then
about 20 percent of the adult population
of the United States is afflicted (Expert
Panel, 1993).

<b>Long-Term Complications of the Metabolic Syndrome</b>

A striking association exists among the disorders
of the metabolic syndrome in risk factors,
etiology, and complications. The
primary long-term effect of the syndrome is
acceleration of atherosclerosis and increased
incidence of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular
events, including stroke and myocardial
infarction. Diabetes ravages the body through
the effects of chronic hyperglycemia and
associated glycosylation products that have
an "aging" effect, causing deterioration of
the vascular endothelium, the glomeruli,
neural networks, and immune system.
Progressive, irreversible damage to the pancreas
results in further hyperglycemia and
eventually insulin deficiency. Diabetes is the
leading cause of new blindness, heart disease
death, end-stage renal disease, and lower
extremity amputations (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 1998). Patients with
diabetes are 1.5 times more likely to be hospitalized
and on average remain hospitalized
for 1.7 more days than people who are not
diabetic (Diabetes Research Working Group,
1999). The primary sites (and consequences)
of damage attributed to hypertension are the
arteries, (stroke or myocardial infarction),
the heart (congestive heart failure, and the
kidneys (proteinuria and failure). Hyperlipidemia
is also associated with pathological
sequelae, notably, coronary heart
disease (Barrett-Connor et al., 1984;
Groop, 2000).

<b>Pathophysiological and Pathopsychological Mechanisms</b>

The metabolic syndrome has evolved
through the years to include several related
problems, which are summarized in Box 20.1.
The high incidence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension,
and hyperlipidemia in the general
population of Western societies strongly
supports the notion of a common genetic and
physiological backdrop, which might have,
in the past, conferred an evolutionary advantage.
Therefore, the hypothesis suggesting
that the phenotype of the metabolic syndrome
represents a morbid collision between
genes essential to premodern survival and
modern affluence has remained popular
(Groop, 2000; Neel et al., 1998).


The psychophysiological mechanisms
underlying the metabolic syndrome are
increased appetite, poor food choices, and a
behavioral tendency to inactivity. Low
socioeconomic status is associated with an
unhealthy lifestyle, poor eating habits, and
lack of exercise. In a study of healthy women,
63 percent of the association between obesity
and low socioeconomic status could be
explained by reproductive history, maladaptive
dietary habits, and a composite of psychological
factors comprising self-esteem and
job strain (Wamala, Wolk, &amp; Orth-Gomer,
1997). In the Whitehall study of people with
and without diabetes, heart disease was
higher in the lowest socioeconomic group,
and mortality among diabetic people in the
lowest socioeconomic group was twice as
high as that of diabetic persons in the highest
socioeconomic group (Chaturvedi, Jarrett,
Shipley, &amp; Fuller, 1998). Urban adults with
low socioeconomic status also demonstrated
an increased risk for cardiovascular disease
(Winkleby, Kraemer, Ahn, &amp; Varady, 1998).
In blacks, the presence of three or more risk
factors was associated with low income and
education, substantiating the influence of
poverty, fewer food choices, and lack of
knowledge about healthy living habits (Diez-Roux,
Northridge, Morabia, Bassett, &amp;
Shea, 1999).

[p. <i>281</i>]

The impact of stressful life events on
physiology is particularly relevant to the metabolic
syndrome. Perceived stress accompanied
by a defeatist attitude leads to activation
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis, and high cortisol levels antagonize the
actions of insulin. For example, people who
have experienced very stressful events (e.g.,
the death of a partner and moving from a
cherished family home) are more likely to
test positive for diabetes during screening.
The stress-induced alteration of endocrine
function must affect the pancreatic beta cells
for a sufficient time to produce the prediabetic
condition; short-term exposure is without
serious consequences (Mooy, De Vries,
Grootenhuis, Bouter, &amp; Heine, 2000). In a
study of 302 diabetic patients assessed for
mood, stressful life events, body size, and
mood state, body mass index was associated
with stress, and negative mood correlated
with waist/hip ratio (Bell, Summerson,
Spangler, &amp; Konen, 1998). Behavioral factors,
such as preference for fats and sweets,
are clearly related to increasing risk of obesity
(Devlin, Yanovski, &amp; Wilson, 2000).


Psychological factors have been correlated
with increased risk for EHT and cardiovascular
disease (Dimsdale, 1997; Forrest,
Becker, Kuller, Wolfson, &amp; Orchard, 2000;
Jonas, Franks, &amp; Ingram, 1997). For example,
a long-term study of 3,310 originally
normotensive persons tracked for up to
22 years found that negative affect was associated
with higher risk for hypertension.
Compared with Caucasian women, black
African Americans women showed a larger
increase in relative risk per unit of negative
affect (Jonas &amp; Lando, 2000).


The thrifty-gene hypothesis was proposed
(Neel, 1962; Neel et al., 1998; Sharma,
1998; Wendorf &amp; Goldfine, 1991) to
explain the presence of genes that conferred
an evolutionary selection advantage to our
hunter-gatherer ancestors. The genotype
fostered increased fat synthesis and storage
during periods of high food availability,
thereby providing adaptation to periods of
low food availability. The idea of a single
gene underlying the development of the
metabolic syndrome was abandoned because
the term <i>syndrome</i> implies a collection of
phenotypes that appear to be tied together by
a common physiology.


Besides genetic influences, the environment
of Western society promotes obesity
through hedonistic appetite and sloth. These
attributes are shared by much of the adult
animal kingdom, facilitating accumulation of
stored energy as fat for periods without food,
such as migration or hibernation. The seasonal
control of fat stores in animals is associated
with hyperinsulinemia, insulin
resistance, and glucose intolerance, strikingly
similar to the basis of the metabolic syndrome
in humans. One particularly stunning
finding in animals, such as hamsters, is that
they can increase fat stores and weight without
increasing caloric intake. How many
patients have tried to tell us that? When seasonally
lean, animals' peak insulin levels
seem to shift to a period of low lipogenic
responsiveness.


Much of the research to elucidate the
physiological mechanisms of the metabolic
syndrome has centered on the central nervous
system and the neurons of the hypothalamus
and suprachiasmatic regions that
control food intake and thermogenesis.
Nuclei controlling sleep, appetite, metabolic
rate, and arousal are proximate and interrelated.
Some major neurotransmitters and
peptides involved in appetite and metabolism
include neuropeptide Y (NPY), thyrotropinreleasing
hormone, corticotropin-releasing
hormone (CRH), urocortin, and orexin,
among others. The similarity between
Cushing's syndrome and the metabolic syndrome
suggests that disruption of the CRII
and the HPA axes is a major contributor to
the development of obesity, diabetes, hypertension,
and hyperlipidemia. CRH inhibits

[p. <i>282</i>]

The autonomic nervous system represents
another regulator of metabolism under normal
and stress conditions. For instance,
stress-induced increases in noradrenergic
activity result in increased hepatic gluconeogenesis,
adipose lipolysis, insulin resistance,
and feeding behavior. Insulin resistance is
present in persons with EHT who are of normal
weight but have impaired endotheliumdependent
vasodilation (Kotchen, 1996).


Normally, insulin attenuates the vasoconstrictive
effects of reflex sympathetic activity,
but persons with EHT lack this modulatory
effect (Lembo, Iaccarino, Rendina, Volpe, &amp;
Trimarco, 1994). Even though insulin activates
the sympathetic nervous system in
healthy subjects, resulting in elevated heart
rate, blood pressure remains unchanged
because of vasodilation, particularly in skeletal
muscle (Hulthén, Endre, Mattiasson, &amp;
Berglund, 1995). Hyperinsulinemia produces
a net increase in muscle sympathetic activity
and norepinephrine release (Sowers, 1997).
Sympathetic hyperactivity and parasympathetic
underactivity remain central to the etiology
and maintenance of sustained EHT
(Brook &amp; Julius, 2000).

<b>Anxiety, Depression, and the Metabolic Syndrome</b>

Anxiety and depression predict later EHT in
whites aged 45 to 64 years and in blacks
aged 25 to 64 years, based on a study of
2,992 normotensive individuals who were
followed for 7 to 16 years. Possible pathways
include sympathetic arousal, increased blood
pressure reactivity, neurotransmitter dysregulation,
and more frequent high-risk behaviors
(Jonas et al., 1997). In diabetes, stable
psychosocial factors, such as marriage and
higher educational level, were associated
with better glycemic control. Sustained high
blood glucose resulting from chronic stress
is mediated by the stress hormones in
contrast to briefer neural effects on blood
glucose (Peyrot, McMurry, &amp; Kruger, 1999).
Stressful life events are associated with
increased variability in blood glucose,
increased glycohemoglobin values, and the
necessity of adding insulin to oral medicine
(Mooy et al., 2000; Surwit &amp; Schneider,
1993). When 151 persons with type 2 diabetes
were evaluated for psychosocial effects
on progression of disease, significant correlations
were found among depression, poor
social support, low socioeconomic status,
and the presence of diabetic complications
(Miyaoka, Miyaoka, Motomiya, Kitamura, &amp;
Asai, 1997).


In patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes,
71 percent had at least one psychiatric illness
in their lifetime; mood and anxiety disorders
were the most common. Glycohemoglobin
values were significantly higher in those who
had recently been emotionally ill compared
with the patients who had never been ill
(Lustman, Griffith, &amp; Clouse, 1988). The
self-care of depressed persons is often disrupted
and is manifested by poor diet, lack of
exercise, less frequent monitoring of glucose
levels, and delayed medication (Goodall &amp;
Halford, 1991). Clinical depression has a
worse course in persons with diabetes, resulting
in an independent morbidity (Gavard,
Lustman, &amp; Clouse, 1993).

<b>Interventions for the Metabolic Syndrome</b>

The primary goal for prevention and treatment
of the metabolic syndrome is a physiological
state of homeostasis that is not associated
with the development of cerebrovascular or

The biopsychosocial model proposes that
psychological and psychosocial factors play a
critical role in fostering acceptance and commitment
to change. Psychosocial factors may
affect blood glucose independently of adherence
(self-care) by increasing liver production
of glucose in response to stress hormones
(Peyrot et al., 1999). Using an empowerment
framework in patient education means teaching
skills, giving information, and designing
plans based on the patient's own goals and
capabilities (Bo, Cavallo-Perin, &amp; Gentile,
1999). Behavior change depends on the
patients' feelings of empowerment in their
abilities to care for themselves. In addition,
providers' can enhance patients' motivation
for autonomy by helping to set goals and
supporting efforts at self-management
(Glasgow &amp; Anderson, 1999).


People with diabetes need the skills to
make good decisions and act appropriately in
their own behalf, despite societal pressures
(Anderson et al., 1995). In the elderly, there
are special considerations to ensure understanding
of the regimen and facilitate adherence.
The dietitian and the diabetes educator
play important roles in helping the elderly
manage their diabetes (Fonseca &amp; Wall,
1995). Glasgow, Fisher, et al. (1999) diagrammed
a pyramid of psychosocial factors
with culture at its base and personal coping
at the apex. Influences on the person with
diabetes range from the interpersonal and
informal or subtle to more formal, institutional
factors. Practitioners treating persons
with the metabolic syndrome must recogmze
the myriad of influences affecting the choices
that people make, identify the gaps in knowledge
or skills and the barriers to change
before designing appropriate interventions.

Questionnaires have been used to define
the internal and external barriers to modification
of diet and exercise in persons with
diabetes. Internal barriers include being too
busy or too lazy. External barriers include
lack of transportation or financial resources.
Those who identified external barriers were
more likely to make changes than those who
identified internal barriers (Ziebland,
Thorogood, Yudkin, Jones, &amp; Coulter,
1997). Once the obstacles to adherence and
the specific situations associated with poor
adherence are identified, it is important to
teach patients ways of coping with these
obstacles (Schlundt, Rea, Kline, &amp; Pichert,
1994).

<b>Standards of Care</b>

Standards of medical care for people with
diabetes were recently revised (American
Diabetes Association, 2001). The standards
delineate the goals of treatment for type 1
and type 2 diabetes and specific components
of a medical history, physical exam, laboratory
tests, and management plan that should
be performed at the initial and ongoing office
visits. Table 20.4 shows the necessary contents
of a complete medical history for
patients with diabetes. Tables 20.5 and 20.6
list the components of the physical examination
and laboratory evaluation, respectively,
for patients with diabetes.

[p. <i>285</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284025-I027&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Forms, kept in the medical record, remind
providers about physical exams and laboratory
tests, and facilitate documentation of
care (see Figure 20.1). Regular use of the
forms signals a need for a change in management
and thereby helps health care providers
identify trends in blood glucose that may predict
increasing severity of the disease. If
symptoms of mood or anxiety disorders are
noted, the patient should be evaluated and
either medical management or cognitive-behavioral
therapy initiated.


Evaluation of the efficacy of the management
plan is necessary before changes in
regimen are proposed. Table 20.7 summarizes
factors to be considered in assessing
the management plan before the initial visit
with a new physician (initial visit) and during
visits for established patients (ongoing
visits).

Use of medications in primary prevention
of cardiovascular disease (i.e., patients
with no identified atherosclerotic process)
typically involves the use of water-soluble
hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A
(HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. These
drugs are not metabolized by the liver, do not
cross the blood-brain barrier, and arc supported
by the West of Scotland study
(Shepherd et al., 1995). Most recently,

<b>Behavioral and Complementary Therapies</b>

<i><b>Diabetes Mellitus</b></i>


A collaborative problem-solving behavioral
approach can improve dialogue between
the provider and the patient. First, define the
problem in the context of the patient's culture
and ability to understand. Then develop an
action plan and set realistic goals on a
time line. Explore the available medications
and behavior-change strategies. Track the
patient's progress on a regular basis, reinforce
positive change, and make adjustments in the
plan based on patient feedback. No single
plan can be expected to cover many years of
illness, so modifications are to be expected
(Glasgow, Fisher, et al., 1999).


In depressed patients, both antidepressants
and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
should be considered. The antidepressants
have variable effects on blood glucose,
depending on whether tricyclics or selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used.
The former are associated with hyperglycemia,
while the SSRIs have more of a
hypoglycemic effect (Goodnick. Henry, &amp;
Buki, 1995; Potter VanLoon et al., 1992).
CBT has been useful in depressed persons

Mind-body therapies used to treat persons
with diabetes have shown variable results.
Thirty-two patients with type 2 diabetes completed
a study in which EMG feedback and
progressive relaxation training were provided.
In the group as a whole, relaxation training
was no more effective than intensive conventional
treatment. However, patients in the
relaxation group who evidenced high trait
anxiety levels showed improved glucose tolerance
and decreased plasma cortisol (Lane,
McCaskill, Ross, Feinglos, &amp; Surwit, 1993).
In another study, anxiety, tension, and skin
conductance decreased with relaxation,

[p. <i>289</i>]

In type 1 diabetes, several studies suggested
positive effects of biofeedback-assisted relaxation
therapy on blood glucose (McGrady,
Bailey, &amp; Good, 1991; McGrady, Graham, &amp;
Bailey, 1996). In contrast, patients who
showed symptoms of depression were not able
to lower blood glucose after a similar behavioral
treatment regimen (McGrady &amp; Horner,
1999). A small study of 15 adolescents with
type 1 diabetes found that stress management
(cognitive restructuring and problem solving)
decreased anxiety levels and improved coping
abilities but did not change blood glucose
(Hains et al., 2000). At this time, the differential
effects of relaxation therapy in type 1 and
type 2 diabetes require further study.


Thermal biofeedback-assisted relaxation
has been useful for people with diabetesrelated
circulation problems. Forty subjects
with diabetes were given biofeedback training
to increase toe temperature and blood
volume pulse; results showed improvements
in circulation in the feet, which could
decrease complications of diabetes (Rice and
Schindler, 1992).


Yoga reduced blood glucose and decreased
the need for oral hypoglycemic drugs in a
group of 149 people with type 2 diabetes who
practiced yoga for 40 days. Yoga training
consisted of one and one-half hours a day of
relaxation, breathing training, and postures
while patients were hospitalized. Two thirds
of the patients demonstrated a fair to good
response in blood glucose (Jain, Uppal,
Bhatnagar, &amp; Talukdar, 1993).


<b><i>Essential Hypertension</i></b>


Two stress management education
approaches, transcendental meditation and
progressive muscle relaxation, were compared
with lifestyle modification education in 100
adult African Americans with mild EHT.
Transcendental meditation decreased systolic
blood pressure by 10.7 mm Hg and diastolic
blood pressure by 6.4 mm Hg, and the relaxation
group decreased systolic blood pressure
by 4.7 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure
by 3.3 mm Hg. Only small changes were
observed in the education group. These
results compare favorably with other nonpharmacological
therapies of EHT such as
sodium reduction and exercise (Schneider
et al., 1995).


The effects of transcendental meditation
on total peripheral resistance were analyzed
in 32 healthy long-term practitioners of the
technique compared with a group of controls.
Systolic blood pressure and total peripheral
resistance decreased and correlated with
decreased cortisol and sympathetic activity
(Barnes, Treiber, Turner, Davis, &amp; Strong,
1999). Elderly blacks taught the transcendental
meditation technique were able to
decrease blood pressure more than the education
and progressive muscle relaxation groups
(Alexander et al., 1996).


Exercise, weight management, and the two
combined were compared with wait-list control
in 133 sedentary, overweight, unmedicated
persons with high normal blood
pressure, stage 1 and 2 EHT. Patients in the
treatment groups decreased systolic and
diastolic blood pressure as well as TPR, while
cardiac output increased. The weight management
group demonstrated lower fasting and
postprandial blood glucose. The best effects
were those found in the group that received
the combination of exercise and weight management
(Blumenthal et al., 2000). A program
of weight loss and low sodium diet was tested
in older obese persons with EHT, while the
reduced sodium diet was also given to elderly
persons with EHT who were not obese.
Both interventions were effective for up to
36 months (Whelton et al., 1998).

[p. <i>290</i>]

Several types of feedback--direct blood
pressure feedback as well as EMG, thermal,
skin conductance, and heart rate variability
biofeedback--have been tested in persons with
EHT. Direct blood pressure feedback was used
without relaxation therapy in early studies by
Engel, Glasgow, and Gaarder (1983). The
experimental group showed a decrease in systolic
blood pressure of 7.3 mm Hg compared
with 4.4 mm Hg in the control group.
Glasgow, Engel, and D'Lugoff (1989) proposed
that feedback and relaxation therapy
should be offered in a specific sequence and
not initially combined. Blood pressure feedback
followed by relaxation training with daily
home practice was suggested to be the most
effective in lowering blood pressure. Direct
blood pressure feedback, using a device that
measures blood pressure from the finger, has
also been applied to white-coat hypertension, a
type of hypertension identified when an individual
manifests elevated blood pressure in the
doctor's office or clinic but maintains normal
blood pressure at home. After a two-week
monitoring period, subjects participated in
four sessions of biofeedback. Significant
decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure
were recorded in addition to decreased
blood pressure responses to mental stress challenge
(Nakao, Nomura, Shimosawa, Fujita, &amp;
Kuboki, 2000).


Forehead EMG biofeedback with adjunctive
relaxation has been studied extensively
in EHT. An early study of 22 trained subjects
and 16 controls showed statistically significant
decreases in both systolic (11.2 mm Hg)
and diastolic (5.7 mm Hg) blood pressure
(McGrady, Yonker, Tan, Fine, &amp; Woerner,
1981). Jurek, Higgins, and McGrady (1992)
combined EMG feedback and diuretic medication
to produce an additive effect. Goebel,
Viol, and Orebaugh (1993) also reported
small but consistent decreases in blood
pressure and ant¡hypertensive medication
compared to a believable control group.


The application of thermal biofeedback to
EHT is reviewed in Blanchard (1990). An
advantage in lowering blood pressure was
observed in those patients trained to increase
the temperature of their hands compared to
the group receiving progressive relaxation
(Blanchard et al., 1986). Over a three-year
period, 108 individuals participated in a
study of autogenic training with thermal feedback
taught in a group setting. Home practice
was recommended. The experimental group
showed significant decreases in systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, increases in finger
temperature, and decreases in trait anxiety
and plasma aldosterone (McGrady, 1994).


Persons with ambulatory blood pressure
of at least 140/90 mm Hg participated in
10 hours of stress management (<i>n</i> = 27) or
were wait listed (<i>n</i> = 33) until after the control
period. The intervention was customized to
patients' psychological risk factors. Blood
decreased in the immediate treatment group
(6.1 mm Hg systolic and 4.3 mm Hg diastolic).
Similar reductions were observed in the waitlist
group eventually treated. The extent of the
systolic blood pressure decrease was related to
reduced psychological stress and change in
anger coping styles. Starting levels of blood
pressure were strongly related with degree of
change (Linden, Lenz, &amp; Con, 2001).


Stress management plus exercise was compared
with exercise alone in patients with
heart disease. At the end of treatment,
patients in the combined treatment group
decreased their global distress score and
blood pressure reactivity to psychological
challenge, the latter particularly important
for lowering risk (Turner, Linden, van der
Wal, &amp; Schamberger, 1995). An important
meta-analysis of trials of relaxation-based
therapies showed that the starting blood
pressure is predictive for the amount of
decrease in blood pressure. When adjustment
are made for differing starting blood pressure,
the best nondrug treatments were as

[p. <i>291</i>]

One study compared respiratory sinus
arrhythmia (RSA) feedback with thermal
biofeedback in EHT. Both types of feedback
were effective in lowering blood pressure,
despite differences in mediating mechanisms. It
was suggested that RSA feedback lowers blood
pressure through an increase in parasympathetic
function, while both EMG and thermal
feedback are effective due to a decrease in sympathetic
function (Herbs, 1994).


Efforts to define the long-term maintenance
of decreased blood pressure in persons with
EHT trained with biofeedback-assisted relaxation
have proven to be complicated. The natural
progression of hypertension and changes
in medication must be factored into the analysis
of long-term biofeedback effects.
Nonetheless, some patients are able to
maintain lower blood pressure years after the
end of therapy (Blanchard et al., 1986;
Leserman et al., 1989; McGrady, Nadsady, &amp;
Schumann-Brzezinski, 1991).


<b><i>Hyperlipidemia</i></b>


Detailed descriptions of weight management
programs are beyond the scope of this chapter,
but the primary care practitioner treating the
metabolic syndrome should be aware of the significant
influence of psychological factors in
obesity. In addition to the medical adverse
effects of long-term overweight are the psychological
concomitants. In a society where a large
body results in negative attitudes and overt
hostility directed toward the overweight
person, it becomes clear that treatment must
consider the mult¡faceted nature of the
problem. Approaches to therapy need to
include behavioral and social components
(Faith, Fontaine, Cheskin, &amp; Allison, 2000).


Behavioral programs comprising exercise,
better eating habits, and psychological support
are considered to be ideal (Devlin et al.,
2000). However, most people trying to lose
weight do not use the recommended combination
of weight management and physical
activity. Conclusions based on a survey of
100,000 adults were that at least one third of
the men and women who were attempting to
lose or maintain weight were engaged in one
or the other, but not both (Serdula et al.,
1999). Diet without exercise does not lower
LDL levels in men or women with high-risk
lipoprotein levels (Stefanick, Mackey,
Sheehan, Ellsworth, Haskell, &amp; Wood, 1998).

<b>Prediction of Treatment Response</b>

A success rate of 50 percent to 65 percent
based on a criterion decrease in blood pressure
of 5 mm Hg mean arterial pressure in studies
of biofeedback in EHT fostered interest in trying
to determine if blood pressure response
could be predicted. In a study of 40 individuals
with EHT, 23 were classified as successful
while 10 failed. Treatment was most successful
for patients with the highest levels of anxiety,
muscle tension, urinary cortisol, and heart
rate and the coolest hand temperatures. In
addition, high normal stimulated plasma renin
activity predicted success in contrast to low
renin activity (McGrady &amp; Higgins, 1989;
McGrady, Utz, Woerner, Bernal, &amp; Higgins,
1986; Weaver &amp; McGrady, 1995).


There have been variable results in studies
of patients with diabetes concerning which
patient characteristics might predict better
response. External barriers to adherence
seemed easier to overcome than feelings of
deprivation (Schlundt et al., 1994). Depression
has been suggested to interfere with a
positive response to bio feedback-assisted
relaxation (McGrady &amp; Homer, 1999); and
poorer adherence to self-monitoring of blood
glucose predicted a poorer response to
cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression

[p. <i>292</i>]
<b>Conclusion</b>

The metabolic syndrome should be approached
as an entity in a combined medical and
behavioral framework. Successful treatment
of any of the major elements may result in
improvement of the others. Understanding of
the psychosocial factors contributing to
etiology and worsening of the syndrome is
critical for the health care provider. Additional
research testing psychophysiological
therapy on blood glucose, blood pressure,
and the lipid profile is urgently needed.
