<b>‘WE ARE FOLLOWING YOUR EVERY MOVE’</b>


After a time I began to hate work, and Bruce sometimes got on
my nerves. I got depressed and crashed out of an evening,
staying up all night listening to Pink Floyd's ‘The Wall’. One
day I was at work, Bruce was out and the phone rang. I picked
it up. ‘We are following your every move,’ said a voice; then
nothing. Instantly the PA system from the next factory,
which was quite loud, said, ‘Telephone for did-you-get-that?
Telephone call for we-know-you're-listening’.


I swung around and looked through the roller door. It was
getting warmer and the sky was blue. I looked at the fence that
separates the RACV from the factory. Was this some sort of
game? I walked outside. A leaf blowing past the corner of my
eye took on the appearance of a huge spider. This must be
what an acid flashback is like. I motioned to the factory next
door, pointing at my ear; ‘Turn it up!’ I yelled across the fence.
Of course, no one was there. I was excited about this game,
and curious about its mandates.


As the weeks passed, I got more cryptic messages. I knew
that these messages were meant for me and that I had to crack
some type of code to decipher their meaning.

<b>ANOTHER CATCH-22</b>


I had been reading a book called <i>Tell Me I'm Here</i> by Anne
Deveson, about her schizophrenic son. It was on my brother's
bookshelf, as he had to read it for school. I found it fascinating,
and began to read over the point where someone
exclaims, ‘I think he's sick.’


A guy walked in to deliver some things to Bruce. He was
long and lanky and seemed to me challenged in a way. I was
glad he had a job - good of the RACV to employ him. He
began talking to Bruce. I was quiet, looking the other way and
doing my work, yet concentrating on the conversation. Bruce
went out to talk to a courier. Lanky Boy walked over and said in
a friendly tone, ‘Whatcha reading?’


‘A book on schizophrenia.’


‘Is that like you?’


I hesitated. I thought about what I had been experiencing,
and reflected on a recent conviction that people were <i>trying</i> to
make me think I was schizophrenic. ‘Sometimes,’ I limply
replied. He smiled and walked out. I was uncomfortable that
in our exchange I was the challenged one. Deep down I knew
something was not sitting right, yet it seemed ridiculous that
I should get an illness I was reading about at the time. I
pushed the idea to the back of my mind, yet digested the book
with vigour.


At about this time I was home at Mum and Dad's. I decided
to go to bed early, exhausted from what I perceived as mind
games being played out by people. I was awake in the wee
hours and I heard angry voices screaming abuse outside my
window, hinting at things that were going on at work and
among my friends. I tried to disregard it, yet I was convinced
there was something ominous going on. I imagined the
people out there, a few fences away so I could not track

The Golden Mean of classical art and architecture gave a method of
dividing up a picture plane so that the image would resolve visually. Here is
a digital image of a face superimposed on a sketch of the Golden Mean;
contemporary and traditional together portray angst and discomfort.
The colours contrast hot and cold hues, reflecting the spectrum
of possible human emotions.</div>

Among other symptoms such as everything feeling
unreal, inability to think straight at times, insomnia,
feeling different to others, hypochondria (thinking I'm
ill all the time) and irritability, I get these things where
sometimes when I am a bit anxious and I'm trying to
get to sleep just as I drift off to sleep I get a feeling like
an electric shock and wake up with a start and my heart
races and I start breathing like mad. Just the other
night I was trying to get to sleep and just as I drifted
off I imagined what looked like a wasp with silver wings
sitting on a log. I looked at it and in a second it shot
towards me and stung me, this caused me to wake up
and get into a panic. Is this another symptom or is it
just because I was slightly anxious and wanting to get
to sleep that it happened? Why can't I be like every
other kid at school? Why did I have to turn out like this?
I smoked pot and so did my friends but they're fine
and it's my head that's messed up. They have such
hassle-free lives and they feel normal! I just want
to be like I was a few years ago. Life is not fair!


<b>ART</b>


I found it hard to get myself together for work in the mornings,
especially after staying up late into the night listening to
the screaming. Mum gave me a lift one morning, and when I
walked into the warehouse, I saw a painting, very like a Jeffrey
Smart painting that I had studied at uni. The picture was
upside down and I bent over to look at it right way up. I saw a
factory and a house, connected by a field.

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘Do you get it?’ said a voice behind me. It was a security
guard I had seen occasionally. I was surprised, trying to gather
the words to address him and simultaneously realising that
the painting was a symbolic gesture of communication
between my place of work and my home life.


‘No, I don't get it.’


We engaged in Smalltalk. I decided he must be a messenger.
Perhaps he knew about the speakers next door projecting messages,
about the people over the back fence at night. I felt a foreboding,
a sensation that objects had been placed for the
ultimate purpose of teaching me something. It made perfect
sense if there was a conspiracy, they would communicate ideas
via something I had studied, an art piece. The security guard
must have liaised with the people who sent the messages
across the PA system. I decided not to confront him about it.


<b>LACK OF INSIGHT</b>


Later that day I was on a break. I smoked three ciggies during
the ten minutes.


‘Telephone call for you're-an-artist,’ blared across the loudspeaker.
The next line morphed into something I could not
understand — ‘Leva-done core uric fastness’ or a word salad or
rhyme similar. I was sure the first was the message, the
second was to disguise the fact that a message had been sent
to me. They were referring to the painting. ‘Come on, you're a
smart cookie,’ I thought to myself. ‘What are they trying to
say?’ Factory, work, home, look for signs at home, the answer
must be there.


These kinds of wayward connections are a classic symptom
of schizophrenia. They make it hard for someone who is
psychotic to engage in things that might be commonplace for
others. For example, I found it uncomfortable at this stage to

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I think there are ways to make art out of murder, and that beauty exists in the natural
cycles and disintegration of things. If you have watched a line of ants, you will know
what I mean. I found I could perceive beauty in unusual things while I was psychotic.
Homeostasis, or belief in opposites (‘The conspirators are trying to kill me but I love
them’), can be a feature of psychosis. I believe in alchemy, and in images like this I am
stopping to examine and define something but also to retell it in a different way.</div>
[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Paradoxically, the product
of this ugly industrial
landscape, the Coke, can
harbour something fertile
— hence the grass growing
from the can leaking
‘pollution’. You can still
benefit from the
artificiality of delusions,
even though they are not
based in reality.</div>

Likewise, social situations were almost impossible to
manage. I always came across as aloof, anxious, nervous, or
just plain weird, picking up on inane snippets of conversation
and asking people to repeat themselves and tell me what they
were referring to.

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>A LEAF AND A MESSAGE</b>


One Saturday, Dad asked me to mow the lawn, and as I was
mowing the front, I picked up a frond from a pine tree. There
were no pine trees around the area. There was one, however,
back in Queensland where the guys were. I touched the woody
foliage. Work, Queensland, home, everything was explicitly
linked. I was angry that people had been gossiping to my
family from Queensland. ‘He's weird, a freak, he's losing the
plot. He takes it up the arse, be wary of that one.’


I find it amazing now that such a bland incident could
blow up in my mind to such a degree. This is a common
feature of schizophrenia in that a simple stimulus like a leaf
or a tennis ball can take on all sorts of implications. To others
it seems as though you have totally lost it, yet I have found
throughout my illness that there is a rhyme and reason to
madness that people around the affected person usually will
not understand.


<b>NUMBERPLATE MESSAGES</b>


I finished the lawn. I was going inside when a personalised
numberplate on a car going past caught my eye: ‘MADONE’.
Thoughts ranged cryptically from the obvious ‘mad one’ to
Ken's mother. There was a Garfield teddy at the window. I had
one in my room hanging from a noose; I found it amusing.
I was certain that this car had been sent to drive past so I could
see the numberplate. ‘I am not mad,’ I thought to myself.
‘They are trying to make me think I am mad. I will play their
game, and I will goddamn win,’ I fumed.


Already manifest in my mind was the idea that there was
a whole organisation that was, for some reason, trying to bring
me down. The weeks passed and I experienced similar occurrences
almost daily. I began to accumulate piles of paper,

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I019&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_caption_12332');">caption</a><div id="_caption_12332" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:1px solid #800000; padding:2px;">ANTHROPOMORPHIC
Schizophrenics often express
themselves in symbolic terms,
perhaps as a channelling of
energy banked up as a result of
thoughts unexpressed.
This can take the shape of
anthropomorphism, as in this
landscape. I can remember
seeing a dozen or so trolleys in
a supermarket carpark
surrounding another trolley,
and finding in it the suggestion
that I was at the centre of
some clandestine activity.</div>

<b>MUSIC TO MANIFEST</b>


I listened to ‘Dark Side of the Moon’ by Pink Floyd over and
over again. I knew it backwards, I would come home from
work and it would be like a drug.


<i>Run, rabbit run, dig that hole, forget the sun, and when at last
the work is done, don't sit down it's time to dig another one</i>.


At work I started to register that people were making
comments about me as I walked past. ‘Have you got it yet?’
‘Shh, here he comes.’


As coincidence would have it, I found out that the guitarist
from my first band worked in the big glass RACV building
opposite the warehouse where I toiled. I called him, and we
agreed to have lunch and catch up.

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘Telephone for cross-the-road,’ rang in my ears as I grabbed
my brown-paper lunchbag and crossed the road to have lunch
with Skeg. ‘I am being tracked, someone is expecting me,’
I thought. I didn't want to go over there, yet I felt I had no
choice. The messages were of utmost importance, and I had to
look for the next clue.


I sat down with Skeg and a few of the other workers, one of
whom I recognised as an old acquaintance of my sister's. It
was a frustrating conversation; every time I wanted to contribute
to something I would miss my chance. I had a foreboding
that this was going to be some type of social test.


Nothing I wanted to say would come out right. When
finally I said, ‘Hey, you know my sister,’ my voice seemed
extraordinarily loud, breaking the silence. Everyone at the
table stopped talking as if to see what the reaction would be to
my feeble comment. The girl's snarled reply was crushing:
‘I wondered how long it would take before you said something’.
It was obvious to me then that the conspiracy had gone
further than I expected. I caught Skeg's eye. I felt he dismissed
me.


At this point in my life, I felt as if I could not concentrate.
I was sensitive to every nuance of social hierarchy, and talking
to people was hard work. My thirst for social contact had been
extinguished. My pleasure and enjoyment was always tainted
by a suspicion of ulterior motives. Schizophrenic people tend
not to be able to experience pleasure or joy. Even now, I could
do with a few more laughs in my life. At this stage, a sliver of
joy or a hearty laugh was indeed a rare thing.


<b>WEIRDNESS ON WEIRDNESS</b>


Looking back, I can see that my paranoia was self-fulfilling.
People were hesitant about talking to me because I really was

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I've been in a mind room. I'd split into two persons and
just one of me would go in and hang out, sit in a chair,
look out the window at the ocean like a blind thing.
Sometimes I'd ask a third to keep an eye on the second
me I left behind, but that was probably just a stupid
worry. This is true. I think what really happens is a bit of
drama in the collective unconscious. I do occasionally
get directly addressed by other people specifically about
what I'd assumed was my private mind-space doodle.
I sometimes feel like an eternal space radio, and yes,
this is a serious broadcast while some other shows are
absolute personal nonsense, and some people don't
seem to understand the difference. Maybe they've been
educated by propagandist media and they're smoking
too much ganja. Anyway, all this is kinda harmless in my
life. Can I go anywhere or do anything in mind-space?
No. I am very careful. Do I ever need a personal guide?
No. I have lots of time and nowhere particular
to go because halleluya I is a bum ... aaaaaaa a
space hobo


<b>MORE OF THE SAME</b>


The weeks passed and I worked solidly, not really going out at
all during the evenings. Bruce accepted my eccentricities, and
was friendly and chirpy as always, but I felt he didn't hesitate

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I got many messages from the PA loudspeaker system and
so that no one would know I was receiving the messages,
I wrote them in a code that I had made up. If the conspiracy
knew I could understand the messages, then they would make
them more cryptic, and I was finding it hard enough to
uncover the meaning as it was.


<b>FUMBLING</b>


A friend of mine, Rossco, was a volunteer firefighter. At a joint
police/fire brigade yearly break-up that he invited me to, I had
sex on an oval with a girl I knew. Originally I went for the
free grog; however, when I was propositioned by this girl,
<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I021&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_caption_18865');">caption</a><div id="_caption_18865" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:1px solid #800000; padding:2px;">CODE
This is one of many secret ‘coded’ representations I drew when I first
became ill. I used them to keep track of how the conspiracy was going.
They were mostly ‘messages’ from auditory hallucinations, and I put
them down in diagrams to help make sense of my distorted
perceptions.</div>
[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To my dishonour, I did not give the girl a follow-up phone
call in the ensuing days. I was not avoiding her in particular;
I was avoiding everybody at that stage.


Somehow I gathered Bruce from work had found out about
it, and he slipped it into a conversation: ‘A phone call saves a
multitude of sins,’ he said. Sex was a big issue with me at this
point. It began to manifest in the messages I was receiving.
I went to sleep at night with multitudes of screaming voices
outside my window. One night, a voice directly outside my window
bade me ‘Watch your step, faggot, or we will arrest you for
sex crimes’. Was it the police persecuting me?, I wondered.


The voices on the PA system started calling me a rapist. As
I arrived at work, the PA system would announce, ‘The
snake's arrived’, and ‘Telephone for rape-the-snake’. I was
extremely hurt and angry at this accusation, and began devising
plots to curb the conspiracy.


In hindsight, of course, I can see it was a delusion blown
way out of proportion. Thinking you are guilty of some
hideous crime is a common symptom of schizophrenia. In
reality the ‘rape’ was a consensual drunken adolescent roll in
the hay. However, even a delusion can teach you a lot.


A few weeks later I met up with the girl again and we went
to a Hoodoo Gurus concert together. Despite my making
bizarre interpretations of conversations all around us, we
enjoyed one another's company.

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>GLASS IS A LIQUID</b>


I went with Rossco and a few friends to a quiz night that the
local fire brigade/police had organised. I hadn't been out for
ages. Usually I stayed shut in my room listening to CDs. The
busyness of the shed astounded me.


One of the questions was ‘Is glass a solid or a liquid?’ ‘What
a ridiculous question,’ I thought. The answer they gave was
that it was a liquid. I thought it was a ploy for me to challenge
the answer in front of everyone. As soon as I thought this, I
heard such things as ‘Contend it’ and ‘How stupid are you???’
in the babble of talking people. I sank back into myself. ‘It's a
solid, what are they thinking?’ I whispered to a friend next to
me. It was the end of the night and I felt I should have stood
up and queried it. The question repeated itself in my mind
over and over again. The issue seemed to be of the utmost
importance. Once I got an idea in my mind, it was like concrete;
trying to convince me otherwise was like saying to
someone, ‘That chair next to you is not actually there’.


Things got rough for me in the last two years of high
school. I began to get depressed and use a lot of pot to
make myself feel better. I was under the illusion that
pot helped me concentrate on school work, deal with
people, have a good time, and to be cool. Overall I think
it triggered psychosis and prevented me from keeping
a job, and made me paranoid and socially inept. In high
school I had quite a few friends, but I scared them off
with my bizarre behaviour. I remember I was at a party
after graduation. This guy was standing there and I just
started staring at him. I thought he was trying to send
me hateful messages and at the time he thought
I wanted to fight. Luckily a friend called him off but

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>METHOD TO MADNESS, YET A BREAK FROM REALITY</b>


Next day I was on work break, chaining rollies. I had been on
a ‘G'day, nice day’ basis with a few of the workers that had ciggies
sometimes when I sat down outside the warehouse.


I noticed that one of the guys was reading a book on glassmaking.
Last night's question was still in my mind, and it was
obvious the organisers of the quiz night had conveyed the news
that I didn't contend the answer. I took this as a message and
decided to be bold. I had had enough of voices and scamming.


‘Glass is a liquid, eh?’ I interrupted his reading.


‘Huh?’ he replied, in the tone of ‘Did you say something?’
and ‘What the hell are you talking about?’ simultaneously.


I told him that glass is a solid and I knew everyone at the
quiz night was in on the conspiracy. He looked confused and
I sensed that I was being irrational; however, I was certain this
was a chance to get to the bottom of things. He answered,
‘Right...’ and went back to reading his book. I sensed I had
opened a can of worms and was disappointed with myself for
not having the courage to play along with the game. Now the
people organising these incidents would know I was following
the clues. I walked back to work, looking over my shoulder
at the guy. He didn't look up. Then I realised the whole of the
RACV front building was mirrored glass. It all seemed to fall
into place.

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>DISMANTLING</b>


I wondered if I would ever get to see inside the mirrored building.
I decided I would have to be stronger to beat this organised
persecution. I reflected that you could see into the building at
night when the lights were on, and I tried desperately to think
of a way that I could break the code to see in: ‘C'mon, I am
smart, I can do this,’ said the everlasting running commentary
in my mind.


At night, I played endless music, and the voices continued.
I got lots of messages from the loudspeakers in the next factory
in the daytime. I pretended not to notice them, while at
the same time trying to crack what I thought was something
cryptic, and of the utmost importance.


<b>DID YOU HEAR THAT?</b>


I begin to think of ways glass could be considered a liquid, and
recalled that the glass in old cathedrals over the centuries

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I entertained these kinds of ideas frequently. I had a core
belief in God, yet it seemed I was in purgatory. I forgave my
supreme being for this, thinking that it must all be for a reason,
and that everything would work out.


Sometimes psychotic people will have what is called religiosity
complexes, a fascination with religion or spiritual figure.
Sometimes it manifests as a good-vs-evil battle. Some
think they are Jesus Christ or another such figure. I can fully
understand how someone could be deluded into thinking this
with the symptoms that have been described.


Many nights were dominated by the voices in my head.
Most were aggressive and hateful. A few were nice or just
cryptic. ‘It's a clue,’ an old, masculine voice screams out. I am
tired, but I am awake. The voices go on for a few hours, I drift
off to sleep.


Once I had been asleep, it was hard to get out of bed. I often
woke and became foetal. I needed to be motionless, I needed
to be more insignificant, I wanted to escape the ensuing day. I
had lost my passion for waking reality. Sleeping was an attractive
alternative. Simply emerging from bed was like ascending
the gallows.

<b>THE RADIO CAN HEAR YOU THINK</b>


I was with a couple of friends, and we had gone for a drive to
the beach to get stoned. I treated them as if they were friends,
yet they had given me ample evidence that they were in on the
conspiracy. They had been mentioning cryptic clues that
related to my work, as had the radio. The PA system at work
had been giving me messages that hinted at ending my life,
and this resonated in their conversations.


I felt foetal. I often felt foetal. I was just going along for the
ride. I had the feeling my body was just a mechanism to transport
my mind to new and more devastating situations of torture.
My life had lost its passion. There were things to do,
people to see, yet as time went on these seemed more of a
chore than anything.


Waiting outside a Seven Eleven for one of my friends, I
flicked through the radio channels. I came to a station where
a man was being interviewed. He was being persecuted. It was
a comedy skit, but I felt the humour was cruel. Even nowadays
I avoid commercial television and especially radio ads and
drive-time comedy, it just seems too abrasive. ‘They know I
am listening to the station, know they are setting me up to persecute
me,’ I thought, just like this person. Something was
said about a light pole, and immediately the light that the car
was parked under went out. They sure were going to a lot of
effort to give me messages. Transmitters, friends turning
against me, family against me, remote-controlled streetlights,
more messages from the radio. Every stimulus harboured a
message. Helicopters overhead filled me with paranoia.


Another night I went to a friend's twenty-first at a pub. I
ended up in the car with the radio on auto-search, listening to
each station for half a second before it auto-searched to the
next. I could even follow the songs on some stations. I had it

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I often pulled those escape acts. Was I mad? Or was it a sane
reaction to an insane world?


<b>LONER</b>


Instead of spending time with friends, who I felt were involved
in something archaic and evil, I began to take drives down to the
beach late into the night, and listen to the radio for clues. When
I heard one, I gave ‘thumbs up’ to indicate that I had received
the message, and it was OK to elaborate or move onto the next
one. I wondered how they knew which radio station I was listening
to. They responded to my command, and gave cryptic
upon cryptic message for me to digest. I thought I could even
control what they said if I concentrated hard enough.


I'm not sure how long these should go so I will try to be
concise and yet reveal as much info as possible. My wife
and I have been married for almost 14years now and
she has been diagnosed with MS since 1992. Just lately
she has begun hearing voices in our attic that speak to
her and tell her about things that are happening that
are not really happening; i.e., our 22-year-old son is
dead, arrested, or in the next room (when he lives in
another city).These voices and sometimes movie-like
scenes are absolutely real to her and even when I
disprove one of the ‘statements’ made by one of the
voices it doesn't seem to faze her in the least.
Is a psychiatrist the only solution?

<b>CATHARSIS</b>


I wrote a cathartic song for my first band:


<i>Listen, listen pay attention,<br />
to intuition,<br />
to another element of yourself.<br />
You may never know me in total,<br />
by the touch of my hand<br />
Halved I appear, united stance.<br />
Elements of myself speak back to me<br />
through a mirror of my mind</i>.


Music and writing were always a source of strength, a way
of crystallising ideas or opening new ideas for consideration.
Performing lyrics like these also purged me of difficult feelings.


Many is the time when a lyric or piece of writing has ended
up manifesting in some form, and I wonder if the dimension
of time is as straightforward as we experience it. Hmm,
maybe that's just a nuts way of looking at things. I get sick of
neutralising thoughts that might be taking me into delusion,
or suppressing ideas in this way. I feel as if I am being robbed
of something.


<b>RUN RABBIT RUN</b>


Back at the RACV, I decided I would escape the conspiracy by
going overseas with a friend, Angela. The conspiracy was making
me tired and depressed. The messages threatened me,
threatened my family and friends, and told me odd things from
‘You are orange’ to ‘The phone, snake’. Sometimes they seemed
to be in another language, but I had the unshakable conviction
that the messages were meant for me. To this day, PA systems
or bike couriers' walkie-talkies increase my heartbeat.

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

People were starting to realise now that I was acting quite
strangely at times, doing strange things. One day, for example,
I arrived in the warehouse armed with easel and ink, determined
under the guise of drawing to spot the cameras
I thought were in the roof, plotting my moves. I don't know
what I would have done if I had seen some. I was certain that
I was under observation and that there were cameras placed
around the workplace to keep tabs on exactly where I was. My
waking experience was bordering on metaphysical, but I still
assumed that there was a terrestrial source to my experiences.


By now you may think it odd that I did not know anything
was wrong, yet it is hard to make judgements about your perception
when it is your own mind playing up.


<b>POETRY</b>


Here's a piece of writing from about this time.


<i>I can sense you do you know my name?<br />
I feel your eyes do you feel the same?<br />
I try to watch you through censored eyes, censored by who?<br />
I can wait to see your face again but I long to know your name.<br />
You hide your subliminal messages<br />
Through my deconstructed vision<br />
You are beyond my realms of comprehension but you find the<br />
time to shed your light.<br />
If life is a sea are you my Neptune?<br />
Is love too primitive for your constructed ways?<br />
You are my control, you are my salvation, you are my enemy,<br />
you are my entity.<br />
Are you mine?<br />
Am I alone?</i>

<b>ARE YOU OK?</b>


Ang confided that people had been saying I was not quite
together, and asked if I was OK. She was studying psychology,
and was one of the smartest and most determined cookies
I knew. I told her I was fine, and thought to myself, ‘I will be
fine once that plane leaves the ground.’ I looked forward to
going overseas, leaving the madness, leaving the isolation.
Yet that was months away.


<b>WEZ WITH A ‘Z’</b>


Wez was my best mate, always a jolly fellow. In our now only
occasional evening trips about the neighbourhood in my family's
Volkswagen, he often used to burst into song, waving his
arms as he did so. He would burst into Deborah Conway's
song, ‘I'll Stand by You!’, gesturing with his arms, and giggling.
To this day I don't know if it was said with intent. But at
the time, it made me feel good. Wez had the capacity to make
you feel good. A sliver of joy, that was all I ever seemed to get.


<b>WE'RE GOING TO KILL YOU</b>


By this stage I was convinced that my phone was bugged and
that the clock radio always humming in the background
described my feelings as they happened. I felt I could converse
with it, and did so for hours on end, sometimes pretending to
look busy if the radio promised a clue or I felt I was on the
verge of discovering something important. Always so close.
So close in futility.


I had a loose sort of relationship with Bruce; he tolerated
my weirdness and incessant cigarette breaks to gather the
messages from over the fence. I did most of the work.
Whenever he left the office I turned the radio to Triple J; when
he returned he would put it back onto the races, as he read the

One morning, Mum dropped me off at work. I said with a
snarl, ‘Don't you <i>dare</i> phone work ...’ I was convinced that
people had been talking about me behind my back, I was desolately
alone. Looking back, I'm sure I was worrying the hell
out of my parents.


My wife has just recently begun hearing voices in our
attic and in the last three days has had numerous
discussions with many different ‘people’ including
some detectives (one good, one bad) who have beaten
and killed some family members and seem to now run
her life. She will listen to them, but not to me.
I have excellent insurance but can not find a psych doc
who is taking new patients. Can anyone tell me if I can
afford to wait another day (it's Sunday and tomorrow is
a holiday)? I do not feel like I can leave the house. She
called 911 early this am to report a killing in our attic.
Please help.


<b>ALL IN THE DIAGRAM, BRUCE</b>


‘Telephone for we're-gonna-kill-the-snake, did you hear that,
snake?’ boomed from the PA. Its message rocked me to the
very core. I wanted to be rid of this burden. I was also angry:
how dare they threaten my life! I was usually calm when I listened
to these people, the pure repetitiveness of the threat
lessened the impact. I was calm when I thought about someone
killing me. I took comfort in the fact that the conspiracy
was so huge; with so many people involved, they would not be

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I drew a diagram for Bruce, explaining synchronicity and
telling him how objects were sometimes placed for me to find,
how messages could resonate with places I have been, things
I have seen, how my mind influenced reality. I told him about
the death threat.


He looked quizzically at me, and with some seriousness
said, ‘Are you all right?’


I explained that it was the conspiracy that was not right, and
that I was going to get to the bottom of it, and that heads would
roll. He asked me to elaborate. I dropped my guard and told
him of the PA next door and its threatening messages. I felt
as if I had betrayed myself by telling him. ‘You're weak, weak,’
I thought to myself ‘He already knows about it, he will not
'fess up.’

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘Why do you think you are that important?’ he asked.


‘Don't give me this bullshit, Bruce, we all know about the
conspiracy, mother-fucker’. He looked startled.


‘I'm getting to the bottom of this, Bruce, straight to the
source. I'm going next door to get to the fucking bottom of this
right now, I'm sick to death of it,’ I said quietly as I leaned over
his desk. I walked out and he smiled encouragingly and said,
‘Well, good luck,’ trying to make light of the confusion.


I stormed out of the office and headed towards the other
factory. I was deeply disappointed with myself; the conspiracy
had got the better of me and I had not found a method to stop
it. I was also disappointed that I had not passed the initiation.
I felt sub-human. I felt I was losing a battle.


In fact, I was losing my sanity.


I don't like what I am hearing. I sometimes think it is
real, but why would someone devote so much time and
energy to this? I can hear it right now. I have to go to
work tomorrow. Is that funny at all?


<b>WE BOTH KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT</b>


I walked through a construction site and for a moment was fascinated
with the machinery and metal structures. I walked into
the office of the factory next door. There was dirty carpet in there
and a cheesy-looking palm tree. A woman with bleached blonde
hair sat behind the desk. She was obviously chatting to a friend
about her weekend. She had a rising inflection in her voice and
an annoying laugh. I believed I was going to uncover something
grand. I paced back and forward nervously in front of her desk.
I felt excited with what I might find out.


‘Hang on,’ she said down the phone, then looked up: ‘Can
I help you?’

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I said that I wanted to speak to the party responsible for the
loudspeakers. She replied with another rising inflection,
‘Huh?’ I told her to cut the shit and that we both knew what I
was talking about.


‘I'm sorry?’ she asked, confused. She started to look nervous.
I leaned over the table and said, ‘The fucking manager — <i>now</i>’.


‘One moment, please,’ she quickly replied. ‘I'll have to call
you back,’ she told her friend. As she walked out the back of
the office I looked at the reflection on a plastic plant, and
almost forgot why I was there. I was certain the conspirators
would respond to me, let me know their secrets, if I just asked
them face to face.


A man in his forties appeared and said professionally,
‘Hello, John Smith,’ or whatever his name was. He offered me
his hand, which I shook. ‘I understand there might be a problem
with our PA system? Can I ask where you are from, is it
too loud?’


‘C'mon, mate, who are you kidding, I want to get to the bottom
of this,’ I snapped.


‘I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about,’ said
the man, the secretary looking over his shoulder in awe.


<b>INSIGHT</b>


It is at moments like these that you have a flash of insight that
something is definitely wrong.


I couldn't help but laugh in front of these two people, so full
of confusion and discomfort. I said, ‘Don't worry about it,’ and
turned on my heels. I cannot describe the distorted mind-set
that I was in as I walked back. I felt happy that my suspicions
were groundless, yet I was certain they were not telling me all
I wanted to know. I was filled with so many emotions they just
amalgamated into no particular one, I was monochromed.

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>IT DIDN'T WORK</b>


I walked back to work and Bruce asked, ‘How did ya go?’


‘It didn't work’, I replied.


‘Oh well, better luck next time,’ he smiled.


I sat down and another threatening message was projected
from the factory next door. It filled me with dread.


I thought, ‘I have just done the thing that the conspiracy
wanted me to do, I showed them that I've been receiving

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I looked at the clock and there were five hours to go. I felt
sick with having to be there for that long. Later, Bruce told me
to leave 20 minutes early, Mum picked me up and we went
home. I did not relay an iota of the day's events. In the back of
my mind was the belief that my parents were aware of what
was going on. In any case, all I wanted was to go home and
crash on my bed, and listen to Pink Floyd.


<i>The lunatic is on the grass ... got to keep the loonies on the
path</i>.


Later that night I was having a cigarette on the back porch
and I heard our neighbour say quite audibly, ‘We all know
about that stuff ...I've been talking to Bruce.’ My whole
world was tainted. I lay awake late into the night, listening to
the voices.


<b>KILL SWITCH</b>


I cannot describe my loathing of the messages, relayed within
the first five minutes of my being at work. They seemed to be
in another language sometimes, and I could not decipher
them, yet I had the absolute conviction that they were meant
for me.


Putting away more files in the warehouse, I heard a message
projected over the PA suggesting suicide. I looked down
at the next file to be put away: the name on it was my surname.
This seemed to carry a weight I could not bear. If I had been
capable of emotion, then I would have sat down and bawled.
However, my emotions over the months had been deeply
buried; I was conditioned to have a poker face. I did crouch
down, though, and take out my Stanley knife from my pocket.
I ran the blade over my left wrist and gently broke the skin.

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Oh dears. I've hurt myself on purpose again. This time
I grabbed a hot coal and squeezed it very hard for
several minutes. Only got a 1st degree burn. Nothing
serious. Only told my friend definitely not telling my
parents, psychiatrist or social worker they'd be really
upset or mad at me and I don't want to see that
happen. Touching the fire really killed at first but then
I got used to it and it wasn't so bad. Oh, gotta go now.


<b>NO RESPITE</b>


Back in the office, Bruce was listening to the races and looking
at the form guide. I couldn't seem to block out the radio from
my mind and the horse names resonated with ideas and
events from the last few months. It was as if my mind was
available to the broadcast. This symptom is called thought
withdrawal, the feeling that ideas are inserted into your mind,
or that you can be controlled by other people or entities. It is
another defining symptom.


You can probably sense that at this point there is ample reason
to be depressed. No wonder schizophrenia is sometimes
confused with manic-depression or bi-polar disorder, and vice
versa. It is often the case also, that anti-depressant medication
is given in conjunction with anti-psychotics. What I needed at
this stage was a monitored dose of anti-psychotics to help me
regain my mind.


In my spare time I read psychology books, as if a part of me
knew something was wrong. However, this self-awareness, or

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I needed input to get my thoughts sorted out before
dealing with the doctor. I did fax a history to the doctor
with my son's permission. My son is not yet interested
in his medications. He is taking them now.
Our family doctor is good and continues to make
monthly appointments for my son. I am feeling low
over this. My son wanted to handle the appointment on
his own. Maybe I should have pushed myself in. I keep
thinking that my son should deal with things on his
own as much as possible.
I always find it difficult to find the balance between
what I can disclose and my adult son's right to his
privacy. Sometimes I find it difficult posting here. But I
also need a way to maintain peace of mind and focus to
get through all of this.


<b>SUICIDAL TENDENCIES</b>


It was at about this point that I mumbled to Mum about life
not being worth living or some such comment. Mum seemed
to take the comment in her stride, yet when Dad came home,
he knocked on my bedroom door and said that I had upset my
mother. Had they known the real chaos in my mind, they
might have called for a CAT scan or something — which could
have been a good thing. For anyone parallel with this state
I was in, I recommend it.


Again I declined seeing a doctor in the next few weeks.
Mum knew I heard voices, and treated the situation as if it

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Unfortunately after taking 56 × 10 mg of Valium
I managed to wake this morning, what a disappointment.
I've really had enough of this illness and
I don't know what to try next. The last time I tried

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>IT NEVER ENDS</b>


The weeks passed, and I was quite isolated. I occasionally got
out of the house to play pool with friends, but I felt I could not
trust them. At home I smoked incessantly and spent a lot
of time petting my dog out on the back porch and drinking
coffee. Animals were a welcome relief. The voices outside my
window became a nightly occurrence, and I would listen to get
the next clues as to what I should do.


To an outsider, I may have come across as just shy and a bit
withdrawn, and I was able to carry out my day-to-day life like
anybody else. Nobody knew about the real discord in me —
although incidents like the following gave people a clue.


<b>STREETLIGHTS</b>


I was calmly telling Shane and Wez that I could turn streetlights
off and on as I passed near them. I convinced them to
drive down Cheltenham Road to watch some particular lights.

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When we got back to my house, I left my bedroom light off
and shuffled them in. We bobbed down near the side of my
bed and I said, ‘Now listen’. For a moment I didn't hear anything,
and assumed that the conspirators were being quiet
because they had seen the other two enter my house. Then the
silence dissipated as I started to hear the voices. Wez was
stoned and crouching at my bedside. ‘Hear them?’ I asked.
Wez, a jolly fellow, was acting as though he was on a great
adventure. Then his attention lapsed and he asked, ‘Can I look
out?’ I said, ‘Don't be stupid, they will see you, it will compromise
our position’.


I look back now and wonder how the hell I could convince
them to come into my room to listen to voices, it seems so
ridiculous. But there they were. Wez said, ‘Well I can't hear
shit.’ Shane on the other hand, hushed us: ‘I think I heard
something’. The whole situation seems very surreal and
macabrely funny to me now, and I am amazed that someone
so nuts could actually convince sane people to entertain such
surreal notions.


<b>I WILL TRUST YOU IF YOU LET ME IN</b>


I often spoke to a few select friends about ‘hypothetical’ situations,
and what they would do in them. They always
reflected the situation I felt I was in, so these few people

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One night I drove madly at great speed down a dirt road,
straight into a swamp at the back of Narre Warren. It was pure
luck that I found a place to do a U-turn and did not get bogged.
I looked around and wondered how I got there. It seemed to
be symbolic of my loneliness at the time. How would I have
explained to anyone that I drove a kilometre into a swamp?
I thought it fortunate I didn't have to. Maybe it would have
been better if I had got bogged. Dad asked the next day why
there was mud all over my car, including the roof. I can't
remember what I said. For my parents, clues like this started
to mount up as more evidence that something was not right.
I think they trod carefully.


<b>THE STREETLIGHTS DON'T LIE</b>


Often I would drive through suburbia and streetlights would
turn off and on as I passed them. I still notice it to this day. In
the past I would disregard it as a chance occurrence unless
there was a simultaneous event that happened, like passing a
car with a numberplate that seemed to have meaning, or a
reference to me on the radio.

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I drew this image when I was a bout 18, before the onset of symptoms.
It amazes me that it should depict so clearly my sense of myself in years
to come, and foreshadow my interest in streetlights.</div>

One particular night I drove under about ten streetlights,
and they seemed to blink off and on when I was near them. I
had been watching lights for weeks as I drove around, and
they seemed to get closer and closer to where I lived. I had it in
my mind that the force behind this was dangerous, and I was
scared of what this entity might do to me.


A painting I'd done with a streetlight in it was hung up in
our hallway, and I thought that if they were manipulating
things that were of interest to me, then they must have got
into the house, and they could not do that unless family members
let them in.


I was driving around with a friend of mine that night.
I stormed home, grabbed the picture off the wall, and thrust
it in Mum and Dad's faces, demanding, ‘What's this then?’
conspiratorially.


As you can probably guess, they didn't quite know what to
say. They kept telling me things were just coincidental. ‘You're
just reading into things, it doesn't mean anything!’ Mum said
on numerous occasions. Of course, I didn't believe them.


<b>OUT OF THE LOOP</b>


Ang was one of the people who didn't know a great deal about
my current mind-set. I had written off most of my other
friends as enemies, but she was from a different circle of
friends. I felt safe with her and was glad we were travelling
together.


We would chat on the phone about places and countries we
planned to visit, making bookings and saving all our bikkies. I
hardly had enough for the flight overseas, but I booked it anyway.
I just wanted to leave my whole life behind. Things were
getting very complicated. I would often pass through the warehouse
and hear someone say, ‘You're dead’.

I began to ignore my perceptions and work on auto-pilot. I
felt like an actor. I had to ignore my perceptions to live day-to-day.
It was hard to be trusting, I trusted no one. I would find
sanctuary in new people and hang out with them, as I felt they
had been untouched by the conspiracy, but it was always just a
matter of time before they too were one of the enemy.


<b>WE'LL GET YOUR FAMILY</b>


It was a Sunday, and I had agreed to mow my grandparents'
lawn. I headed over in the Volkswagen, feeling OK. I was glad
to see them.


After I finished mowing the lawn, Grandpa came over for a
chat. He confided in me that Grandma said she heard voices
from outside her window at night, and was distraught about
this. Sometimes she thought he had a young lover, hiding in
the cupboard. ‘How dare they bring my grandmother into
this?’ was my immediate response.


For a second I was wracked with guilt for not being able to
protect my family. I kissed them goodbye and was just driving
out of the street when I saw a car numberplate that said:
‘GRNMAR’. My heart skipped a beat. I drove out of their
street, my mind sprinting. A car pulled out in front of me and
I nearly ran into it. Its numberplate read ‘CRAZY’.


I was now utterly sure that the conspiracy had gone another
irreversible step. What had I done that people would want to
worry my poor frail old grandmother?


I saw another numberplate saying ‘DOVES’ as I drove
down my street. Just as I was wondering what that could possibly
mean, I pulled into our driveway and saw an unusually
large flock of doves on the garden path. I could just imagine
people on the other side of the fence having just offloaded
a box of them. Even more sinister was the idea that some

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I got home and told my sister of the numberplates and synchronicity
and about my family being punished for my sins.
She looked blankly at me. The phone rang. It was Grandma.
She had forgotten to throw a tenner my way for the lawn.
I said not to worry about the money and I would see her soon.
‘See?’ I said, hanging up. ‘Synchronicity reigns supreme.’
Then my sister burst into tears.


<b>WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU?</b>


I was quite shocked at my sister's reaction. She asked me to
get some help, as she was very worried. I gave her a hug and
said everything would be all right. It wasn't the only time that
I said this to people; ‘I am fine, there is nothing wrong with
me’ — for as far as I knew, there wasn't. At least, I didn't want
to think there was.


I was convinced people were trying to make me think I was
delusional. I thought I was on top of things. How different
were the belief systems of my sister and I at that moment —
worlds apart.


Years later I have met people who are running from treatment
because their idea of being mentally ill is such a part of
who they are that they don't know any alternative. It is hard to
give up the idea of who you are.


My sons are 25 and 26 and I am very apprehensive for
them. 3 of my sister's 4 kids developed paranoid
schizophrenia. (She and I have it as well as dad,
granddad and cousins.) You're not alone.

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I feel so much better. I stayed on the meds because I
didn't want to go back to the hospital. I don't hear any
voices anymore and I'm not depressed. I wish my voices
were here. I miss them. Now there is just me. It's like a
voice crying out in the void.


<b>SUBVERSION HAS ALTERED</b>


By this time, psychosis had been entrenched for so long that
I'd forgotten what life was like before. I was young and vulnerable,
trying to sort out sexuality, finance, employment. The
knowledge that my Bachelor of Fuck All would not get me anywhere
made me feel a bit useless. At this vulnerable time,
I even entertained the idea that I was schizophrenic — man,
would that be the easy alternative! I still thoroughly believed

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>BATTLING DELUSION WITH A PLEDGE</b>


I felt betrayed (or at risk of betrayal) by everyone around me
at this point. A bunch of us had gone out to play pool, and I
invited Shane back into the house. Something he said, not
available to my memory now, reinforced the suspicion that
there was something clandestine going on. I immediately got
a piece of paper, and wrote the following:
<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I031&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_caption_64622');">caption</a><div id="_caption_64622" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:1px solid #800000; padding:2px;">
In regards to Rich:
There is absolutely nothing of importance or significance that
I'm not letting on about and I realise friendship and honour
depend on this.
Signed ...</div>
[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

These sorts of things, I now realise, could come under the
category of ‘reality testing’. In making Shane sign the paper,
I was struggling to strip away delusion and chaos. It didn't
work. The pledge was pinned to friendship and honour, but
I had no real faith that these qualities existed. He just went
along with it, and my delusions remained. Looking back at my
own experiences, and observing them in other people, I know
that trying to convince someone their beliefs are not real is
like trying to bail out the ocean with a bucket.


<b>PRESENTATION TYPIFIES MIND-SET</b>


At this time I had long hair, way down my back. My
sister was in the bathroom doing her makeup. I saw a pair of
scissors and said casually I might cut my hair. My sister didn't
think I was serious, she knew I liked my hair long. On a whim,
I picked up the scissors and, while she wasn't looking,
grabbed my ponytail from the top and lopped it off. ‘What the
hell have you done?’ she asked. I replied, ‘Told you I'd do it.’


Well, for the next hour Mum and my sister tried to style it,
but in the end we just combed it and whatever stuck through
we cut off.


I think now that I was attempting to change my appearance
in accordance with the changes in my persona. Since then
I have read and observed that abrupt changes in clothing,
shaving one's head, or uncharacteristic unkempt appearance
can be an early sign of psychosis.


<b>THE VOICES ARE THE NORM NOW</b>


I heard voices outside my window every night now — groups
of people on the other side of the fence, or maybe a few streets
away so I could not track them down. They were always

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My parents did remarkably well in the face of such mad
ideas. On the whole, though, I was not trusting enough to talk
about these things with them. I suppose it was part of my
general withdrawal from the people around me. I guess they
had to learn acceptance, and they did it long before me.


Mum suggested again that I sleep in the front room so the
voices wouldn't bother me. To me, it was as if she'd admitted
she knew all about them. I assumed she thought the persecution
was justified, that I did deserve such a fate, and that she
had a duty as a mother to protect me. For someone who usually
goes out of the way to avoid conflict, I really was in the
thick of it. So many conflicting ideas.


I looked her square in the eye and said I was going to go out
and find them. I did not realise at the time how pained and
helpless she must have felt.


I hear voices all of the time and sometimes they tell
me to hurt myself. I haven't hurt myself since this time
last year when I went into the hospital. I am also very
paranoid. The voices tell me that someone is out to get
me and they are going to shoot me in the head.
I am forty years old, and live with my mom. I cannot go
outside as I am very afraid. I am divorced twice and
have four grown children. They are understanding and
appreciative. I have a brother who is bi-polar, so we are
really there for each other.

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU</b>


I was in my room listening yet again to Pink Floyd and trying
not to hear any of the voices outside my window when Mum
came in and tried to convince me to go and see a doctor. I said
something along the lines of ‘Nah, Mum, I'm really all right, I
don't want to see a doctor’. I could always pull myself together
in order to escape conflict. I didn't want to upset her, but I
wanted her out of my room all the same so I could be by
myself. I wanted to sort myself out, I wanted to have people
around that I trusted, yet I wanted to be alone, I wanted people
to drop in, I wanted to understand what was happening to
me. Had I known what was going to happen, I would have
taken Mum's suggestion immediately.


By this stage I was convinced that because I had read a book
on schizophrenia, people were trying to make me think I had
it. If I were to go and see a doctor, then it would mean the conspiracy
had won. There was no way I was going to let that happen.
So I was adament that I did not need to see a doctor;
indeed, I was quite abrupt with Mum. Doctors: definitely not.


<b>BETTER GET A LAWYER, SON</b>


As I had been in the band scene for a few years, I liked to
spend time in pubs seeing Jimi Hocking, Seaweed Gorillas,
and bigger bands like Midnight Oil. One night I found myself
next to Tex Perkins, singer from The Cruel Sea. I did not talk
to him, but soon after that I heard their new single, ‘Better Get
a Lawyer’: another sign.


I was quite astonished that a song would be written about
me, but fully believed that it was. I bought the single soon
afterwards, holding it up in the air as I left the record store just
so that those following me could track my progress. I wanted
‘the Conspiracy’ to be aware I had received the information

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>TELEVISION SPEAKS</b>


I began to look at the media as another channel of persecution.
Why not? By now everyone I knew was involved in the conspiracy;
of course they would get media people in on the act.


As I went through the lounge room, I saw Rex Hunt, fisherman
extraordinaire, on the TV, saying that I had fucked everyone
over and was now leaving the country. Fucking oath I was
leaving the country, I said to myself — anything to rid myself of
this burden that enveloped me.


I was really upset the other night because the people
on the news were saying what my thoughts were.
I know this is true because they sent me messages on
what they were doing. I hate it when they can tell my
thoughts to everyone who is watching them, I also hate
it when people can hear my thoughts and know
everything about me.


What did I do to deserve this? I never asked for schizophrenia.
It just came without my permission. All I want
is the powerful force and the voices, nothing else.
I don't want to be paranoid, depressed, full of anxiety,
pain and sickness and all those other psychotic
symptoms.


I'm kind of excited because I'm going to see <i>A Beautiful
Mind</i> when it comes to theatres in Owen Sound and of
course I have a lot of regression and bizarre behaviour
and I'm still hearing those funny voices. Some are very
derogatory, and others are nice.

[p. <i>77</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>ROMA PRESENTATIONS</b>


I was working again, listening to the messages and avoiding
conversation with Bruce. Walking through the mobile shelving,
I got up to ‘R’ and the second I read a bit of writing on the
folder, the loudspeaker across the fence confirmed there was a
message in it. Then I realised it was in my father's handwriting.
Why on earth would my father write ‘Roma Presentations’
on the folder? It must be a clue.


I went back into the office and out of the blue, Ang suddenly
rang. She said that due to a booking error, we would get a 26-day
tour in Europe for the price of a 20-day tour. I was happy to hear
it, and asked where were the extra stops. ‘Rome,’ she said,
rolling her ‘r’s as if she had just seen an appetising dessert.


So now the conspiracy was leaking into my overseas plans.
I was wary of Ang now, although I truly believed that she had
no part in the conspiracy yet, that it was the work of people
bugging the phones and tracking my moves.


Later in Rome another coincidence would occur: I began a
travelling romance with Kylie, a pretty blonde woman from
Western Australia. She knew psychosis all too well: she was a
psychiatric nurse.


Late last August my wife had an acute episode that
lasted 7 weeks where she had delusionals,
hallucinations and extreme paranoia, she was scared to
her very soul. She felt everyone was out to get her and
kill her. She thinks ‘they’ got me and implanted a chip in
me and now control me to work against her and to kill
her. She tried burning fish incense in our house and
spreading holy water from the church to cleanse us. She
called the police to report all the people following and
watching her.



[p. <i>78</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I talk to her every day and see her occasionally but
always ends up that I am out to kill her and that Satan
has me etc. etc. to the point where my patience wears
out and I break it off just because I can't take it
anymore. I don't argue with her or deny her beliefs but
she just won't let them go. And the sad part for me/us
is that maybe she never will. You can't disprove or
argue with delusions or hallucinations.


All I can do is stand by and pick up the pieces. It's so sad
to watch something beautiful go bad and not be able to
do a thing about it.


<b>A FRIEND'S VOICE</b>


I remember one night hearing the voice of an old university
friend, Amanda, saying ‘Rich, your Dad's got cancer,’ right
outside my bedroom window. I felt somehow guilty about
this. Years later, she called out of the blue. That same week we
found out Dad had to have skin grafted from his neck to his
nose — quite a big operation. I often wonder whether events
like this have any meaning at all. It is often hard, even when
you have recovered, to see falseness or delusion when you
have experienced it as real.


<b>POETRY</b>


I was always writing snippets of prose or poetry on bits of
paper. This one shows some of what I was feeling at the time.

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>You are part of me not because I know you,<br />
but because you exist</i>.


<i>There lies potential in strata of chance and destiny,<br />
to meet you face to face</i>.


<i>You can't hide the light of your soul from me<br />
by simple physical boundaries</i>.


<i>We breathe the same air,<br />
live under the same sky</i>.


<i>You are me, I don't want to kill you, I can learn<br />
from you in ways you would never expect</i>.


<b>CATCHING MUM AND DAD</b>


Often when I was with someone, when I turned my head I
would hear their voice saying cryptic, ominous things. When
asked ‘What did you say?’ they would invariably say ‘Nothing’.
I was forever trying to catch people out and never succeeding.
The voices in the back yard would never materialise when I
placed microphones outside my window to record them.
Astonished that they would never repeat themselves with a
tape rolling, I would then search my room for cameras.


Eventually my suspicions spread to Mum and Dad: the night
voices began screaming that I should move out, that my parents
hated me. I was crushed at the thought and forced myself to put
the curses to the back of my mind when I was talking to Mum
and Dad. Just as I thought what it would be like to have them yell
out at me through the darkened house, they did. The only thing
I could think of was to catch them in the act.


The only way to do it was to be on the other side of the door
when they yelled stuff at me, then bust them. There was a
problem, though: the glass doors of the family room were in

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I can relive the experience now as macabrely funny. I am
under my doona, crouched down on the floor, like a turtle, and
I am going to bust Mum and Dad's cover by confronting them
when they yell abuse at me. Slowly I inch my way across the
floor. I take a peek out the window and see our dog cowering
at the door as he often did. My breath makes puffs of vapour
in the cold and the moon is near full. I get across the doorway
then do an army roll into the kitchen, complete with doona
cover.


Then I hear Dad's distinct and clear voice: ‘He's in the
kitchen’. How did he know? The only possible way was via his
bedside radio, which had to be connected to ASIO.


I am exhausted, I am alone, I am on the kitchen floor hugging
my doona. ‘Cunt,’ outside voices scream, ‘Kill yourself,’
they scream. Aha, this is the test — they can't kill me so their
plan is to make life so hard for me that I do it myself ... I am
instantly stoic: nothing will break my spirit, I am fucking
going to win this test. They know I am in the kitchen now, so
I just walk back to my room. I give them the bird as I walk past
the glass doors. I listen to the abuse for an hour or so, then
turn up the stereo so I can't hear them. I sleep exhaustedly
without dreaming. When I wake up, I fantasise about being
somewhere exotic and far away, where no one could know me.


<b>YOU WANT THE CAR?</b>


My parents' Ford was stolen, and I began to hear messages
associated with it. My general feeling was that I was not passing
the tests set for me, and as a consequence my parents were
beginning to suffer. I even wondered if Mum and Dad had
agreed to this car-stealing as a test of my loyalty to them. The

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As in the incident with my grandmother, I was depressed at
the thought of people I loved being brought into these scenarios.
I was racked with guilt, and felt I was a burden. I could
trust no one.


I was driving in the Volkswagen not far from my home, and
a voice said on the radio, ‘Turn right for the Ford’. I was astonished
at the clarity and purposefulness of the message. I
decided that if I ignored the message they would have to give
me a more obvious one that I would be able to record or store
in some concrete way, confirming my suspicions of a grand

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I decided not to follow the command, but was certain the
message was accurate in telling me where the car was.
I felt guilty that my parents knew nothing about the car, and
that I was doing them a disservice by not responding. Then
again, if Mum and Dad were in on the plan and they knew I
was not letting on where the car was, all the more reason for
them to join the other side. I felt trapped. In retrospect I curse
my vivid imagination for dreaming up such myriad complex
ways for me to be persecuted!


<b>THE CAR IS RECOVERED BEFORE YOUR MIND</b>


A week later the car was found behind a McDonald's store, not
far from where I received the hallucination, funnily enough.
The police talked to Mum and Dad and it was revealed that
guns were being sold out of the boot, or that guns were somehow
involved with the stealing of the car. I thought it was a
hint that the conspiracy was threatening murder, with me
number one on their hit list. I pushed the idea out of my mind
in moments of clarity.


<b>LOGIC OUT THE WINDOW</b>


I reflect that when I was delusional, I felt the part of me that
controlled logic just went out the window, and things that
seemed ridiculous to other people or indeed myself at this present
time, seemed totally real, unquestionably true.


At this point I should say that the whole time these ‘events’
were going on, I was still mixing quite sociably with my family
and friends, and most of the time they seemed to be quite
accepting, however bizarre my comments were from time to
time. Once when I complained about voices outside my window

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>I DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS</b>


I was feeling very low by now, still getting a daily barrage of
messages at work, and they were getting me down, lower than

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One morning I walked into the RACV and opened the big
roller door. It was a cold windy morning and leaves were blowing
in the door. The PA system said, ‘Ready for another day,
cunt?’ I looked around the warehouse for cameras again,
looked at the speakers perched up on poles next door, wires
running to somewhere important. I would have liked to drop
to the floor and bawl. However, months of torture had driven
my emotions literally underground beneath a stoic surface. I
thought, ‘I just can't take this any more; I have no one
I can trust, and fuck this conspiracy, I feel as if I am in a
labyrinth. I need to escape’.


Bruce was not at work yet. Hoping I wouldn't run into him
on my way out, I left the RACV forever. I crossed the Princes
Highway, heading home, for want of a better place to go. Two
men working in a front yard caught my eye as I walked past.
They were saying, loudly enough for me to hear, something like,
‘We will follow you wherever you go and make life hell for you’.


<b>EVEN GOD IS IN IT</b>


The conversation I overheard may well have been about the
footy, but I took it as more evidence of how far the conspiracy
was prepared to persecute me.


I was awed by how clever it was. Ironically, this respect for
the intelligence of the conspiracy allowed me to read more
meaning into common conversation, or mundane events. A
newspaper blew in front of me and the headline seemed inexplicably
linked to my situation. I got to the point where not
only people were in on the conspiracy, but I could see hints of
something God-given or organised.

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I am not surprised at all when I read that some schizophrenic
people believe for example they are Jesus Christ, or some other
spiritual figure. The world can speak to the psychotic person in
many ways through analogies, metaphor or symbols. Not long
ago I did an IQ test, with varied results: in maths I got 8 per cent,
in analogies I got 95 per cent. It makes me wonder if there is a
predisposition for a delusional personality.


<b>I'LL HACK IT BECAUSE I NEED THE CASH</b>


If I was going to make it overseas to escape my horrible and
exhausting existence, then I needed to save as much money as
I could. I had frequent conversations with Ang about how
much we had saved up, and she was leagues ahead of me.


I had many jobs in this time. The most humorous to me,
looking back, was delivering high-class cuisine from restaurants
to houses in affluent suburbs. Dressed in a tuxedo, I
would pick up flounder and lobster in our beat-up old combi
van, and deliver it to mansions in Toorak and South Yarra. To
confirm delivery, we had a CB radio system linked with the
base in Glenhuntly. Well, you can imagine the voices and
delusions that I experienced through this walky-talky gadget.
And in a weird twist, I really was being tracked through the
suburbs.


As I drove around, listening to messages from the CB and
radio, I would invariably get lost. Looking back I'm amazed I
didn't have an accident. A five- or ten-minute delivery might
take me an hour. I read meaning into the names of streets I
was sent to, again confirming delusions.


<b>BON APPETIT</b>


At one stage I had to brake suddenly, and a piece of flounder
on a silver platter ended up upside down on the floor of the

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>CHASING PLANE FARES</b>


I took many jobs through casual work agencies, packing, filing
papers and filing metal, banging pallets together, and all
the time the conspiracy followed me. At one place I thought
they were trying to make me believe there were small monsters
in the air-conditioning units, by rattling them from the
other side of the wall. ‘How stupid do you think I am,’ I used
to think to myself.


I was very depressed, and my communications with people
often ended in a stigmatised reaction. It was only through
