<i>T</i>wo months later I'm still on C-1, the open
ward. I continue my work program doing various tasks on
the ward and begin socializing more with other patients.
C-1 signals my readiness for the next step. "Step-by-step,"
that's how I think about my treatment plan. The jobs I do
on the ward aren't enough any more. I've got to prepare
myself for a future life outside the Castle. When I begin
living on the outside, I have to support myself. How can I
get ready for that? That's the dilemma I present to Dr.
Baylor. I already have an idea and she agrees with it. With
her help I'm accepted into the rehabilitation workshop program
located on the Castle grounds.


The hours at the rehabilitation workshop are from eight
in the morning until four in the afternoon. After a few
weeks part-time, I begin a full program--it's not easy. I'm
apprehensive about being away from the ward for such
long periods, and the work is physically demanding. The
long hours strain my concentration and periodically I drift
into a shadowy area of consciousness, where my earlier
anxieties seem close at hand. My first job is lacing shoes.
My fingers bleed as I pull the laces through the shoes, the

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sheila, the rehabilitation counselor, shows an interest in
my work. She starts talking to me, asking me about my
plans.


"You know," I say to her one day, "you really shouldn't
talk to me. You really shouldn't ... because you can't help
me."


Sheila looks perplexed, as I continue, '"You really can't
help me anymore. People have tried to help me in the past,
and I used it badly. So now, I've got to do it myself."


"I think I know what you mean, and I can respect that,"
Sheila responds, "... and I won't force anything, but if
you need my help, let me know." Sheila's a wise woman.
She's doing her job, trying to counsel me as one member
of the rehabilitation workforce. But she sees her clients as
individuals, each with different needs. Her help would
have been good for others, but not for me. "I've got to
start changing what I'm doing," I tell her, emphasizing my
own resolve and responsibility. "I know because I've
abused the help of others before."


Being at the rehabilitation workshop continues to present
problems. I still have attacks of anxiety, and though I feel
the world of Hell dissipate in frequency and intensity, I
know it can return. And periodically it does, both on and off
the job. I'm constantly on guard, and often tightly wound
up in fears of my own potential fears. When my anxiety
becomes too strong, I have to leave the workshop. My
attendance record is spotty. But at the workshop I meet two
other women who inspire me by their own behavior.


Terry and Edna, women in their early twenties, are both
active, lively persons who work diligently and with enthusiasm.
They both live outside, in their own homes, coming

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I also notice that Terry and Edna are very regular in their
attendance, staying the full day even when they aren't feeling
well. And while at the workshop, they always complete
their jobs. I struggle to be that way. I begin to model
myself after them, sticking more to the daily routine, even
though it sometimes seems impossible to go on for another
minute. There continue to be many days when I'm too
tired to go to work, or too scared to leave the ward. But
gradually, I develop a sense that my work counts and
eventually I become more dependable.


Edna and Terry become and remain unique friends, special
people in my life. So does Sheila, the counselor at the
rehabilitation workshop. Gradually, as I trust her more, I
allow her to offer me advice. Seeing that her help doesn't
take away from my own efforts at self-help, I'm more
confident I can use, rather than abuse, her assistance. Soon
I'm visiting these three women at their homes, and I observe
more closely how a woman can be warm and loving
and also hold down a job. Nothing in my upbringing, where
women stayed home and raised the children, nor in my long
stay in institutions, had given me that wonderful example.

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Eight hours a day during the week I'm at the workshop.
But C-1 remains my home and there too things have gotten
better. Robin Stein is now head nurse on the evening
shift. She's a wonderful person, who opens her heart and
home to me, inviting me into her trailer home on the
hospital grounds for dinners and holidays. She and her
husband and three young sons make me feel special whenever
I visit, a welcome addition to their family. I become a
regular part of family gatherings and celebrations, rekindling
some of the old feelings of joy that I had during
family celebrations at cousin Lena's back in Gloucester.
Robin's kids are especially affectionate, taking me into
their lives without any hesitation. I become very attached
to that family, and Robin becomes my closest friend.


After a few months, I'm shifted to the workshop office
and begin doing clerical work. There I meet and become
friendly with Becca, a former patient at the Castle, who
now lives outside with her husband and children. As we
grow to trust each other, we spend hours together, sharing
our private thoughts and our hopes for the future. Becca is
the first person I've been ready to tell about one more part
of my recovery plan--I want to go to college someday.
She believes in me and feels that idea is only natural. Does
that ever make me feel good! I was afraid anyone I told <i>that</i>
plan to would only humor me, or try to discourage me.


On weekends I receive permission to stay with Becca
and her family. Becca has three children, and like children
can, they break down barriers and bring me right into the
family. It's not long before Becca asks me if I want to leave
the Castle and live with her, until I'm ready to get a place
of my own. At first, I wish she hadn't asked. "It's too soon
... I'll fail"--negative thoughts go through my mind.
I'm intimidated by her questions, unsure of my ability to

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Two days later, I pack my suitcase and leave the Castle
for Becca's. I'm still suffering from periods of anxiety, but
I leave with a sense of adventure and hope. I'm going to the
outside, making further contact with the real world. That's
what I've been struggling for. There were other times
when I returned to the outside after a stay in the hospital,
but this time is different. My life is stretching in front of
me, and I'm eager to get on with it and move to the next
step. And now I have friends, close friends, to support me.
At the workshop I also meet Joe. He has a way of smiling
at me that makes me feel good inside. Six feet tall, with
broad, lean shoulders, he towers over me, but never makes
me feel small. And he's good-looking, with black, wavy
hair and warm, hazel eyes. I don't know whether Joe's a
patient or a staff member, but it doesn't seem to matter. I
like being around him, even though I'm confused about
what to do or say in his presence.


Joe, I learn later, is a former patient. He'd been sick since
he was a young man, had suffered a mental breakdown and
been hospitalized at the Castle, but had been released several
years earlier. Once out, he finished college at Boston
University with a degree in accounting and now he's
the workshop's accountant. Joe's always so confident and
good-natured, and especially well-groomed, wearing neat

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One day Edna comes over. She works directly under
Joe. She begins to tease me gently, "Marie, what's this
between you and Joe? You're always looking so intensely
at each other!" I blush. I'm so embarrassed others can see
what I think I've been hiding. That makes me nervous--
not the old panic of being pursued by the monsters of my
illness, but a pleasant tension which makes me giddy and
excited. I don't know what to do next, but still look forward
to seeing Joe again.


Though I can now admit to myself that I really like Joe,
I try not to pay too much attention to him. I'm painfully
shy around men; I've never dated a man in my life. But it's
hard to ignore Joe. We work in the same office, passing by
each other many times during the day. Being in such constant
contact is difficult. I'm unsure of myself around him.
Why do I feel so mixed up in his presence? Maybe he'll
detect that I like him. That embarrasses me. At the same
time I'm more and more aware that I not only like him--
I'm really attracted to him.


While visiting with Becca, I tell her about Joe. "I like
him but ... but I'm afraid of getting too close." She just
laughs--smiling. I tell her again that I really like him.
Becca has realized all along that I'm serious. "Then why
don't you invite him over here for Thanksgiving dinner?!"
"Why not!" I reply firmly. "Where did that come from?" I

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next morning at work, I'm on edge. I've decided to
invite Joe to Thanksgiving dinner, but I'm too shy to ask.
At noontime, I find myself in the office, alone with Joe; the
others have left for lunch. "What do I do now!" I think to
myself, almost out loud. Then, as if on autopilot, I walk up
to him, and stand before him as he sits behind his desk. I'm
so nervous he can probably see my heart pounding away!
My invitation is but a whisper, but he quickly responds,
"Sure, I'd like to do that, I'd really like to come!" Did he
really say that? I'm shocked. I can't believe it's as easy as
that! That afternoon I'm on an emotional high.


Thanksgiving dinner is fun, and a good idea. Joe lives
alone in Stonehill, commuting to the Castle each day. He
has been divorced for many years and his two children live
with their mother out of state. Joe's only other close relatives,
his mother and sister, are also out of state. He really
appreciates spending the holiday time with a family.


Shortly after the Christmas holidays, Becca gets sick
again and has to return to the Castle. I take care of her three
kids while she's away, and that's a big new responsibility
for me. When she comes home again, I decide it's time to
take another major step in my plan. I've been in the workshop
program a full year now. Feeling stronger, I want to
move out of the Castle completely and look for an apartment
of my own. Dr. Baylor arranges for a one-year
indefinite visit status, and with Terry's assistance, I locate
a three-room apartment just outside the town of Sutton.


This move is different from the other times when I'd
been placed by some agency, usually in a single room in
some dingy hotel. Now everything is brighter. Now I let

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But it's very lonely at first being in a strange neighborhood.
I've moved to a place far away from my relatives and
the familiar shops I grew up around. Luckily there's that
diner down the street. I go there all the time--at least they
know me there. I hope I'll get to meet other people on the
block. And soon I do.


The excitement of the move wears off and I often feel
tired--and periodically, very scared. Even though I'm
generally doing much better, I still have occasional attacks
of anxiety. But I'm determined the attacks won't take over
my life. While struggling to keep my emotional life under
control, I realize my physical health isn't good. Sometimes
my tiredness turns into a deep fatigue, and I begin to notice
that my urine is always tinged with blood. I'm worried,

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Time passes. I forget the tiredness which often overtakes
me. There's too much to do. I've left the rehabilitation
workshop and work at Hunt Memorial Hospital in Sutton,
sterilizing equipment in the central supply department.
It's not the kind of job I want for my future. The vow I
made in the Chapel, to dedicate my life to helping others
suffering from mental illness, is as strong as ever. But this
job sterilizing equipment takes me another step away from
the Castle, and I'm grateful. Even though I'm living outside,
I also long for the Castle, deeply missing my friends
there. Sometimes I can't stop crying when I think about
Miss Wendall and Dr. Baylor and my lifelong friends
among the patients. I tend to remember the good parts of
my stay in the Castle, and I get homesick. For me, the
Castle is now a home which has been lost forever.


The pleasures of my new life are many, and they fill me,
gradually releasing my deep sadness about the Castle. Sitting
by my apartment window one day, I watch the children
playing outdoors. The sun brings a lushness to the
leaves of the big oak which dominates the yard. The children
dart from the shade into the brilliant patches of sun
that sprinkle the grass. Shouting joyfully, they run after
each other in a chaotic game of chase. Life's brimming all
around. And I feel its energy too ... and breathing deeply,
feel the beauty of the day. It's one of those times when you
know it's good to be alive.


After work, I often visit. I never tire of cooking Italian
food for friends in "my very own" apartment. We laugh a
lot together and I grow increasingly comfortable in the real
world, which has always seemed so far away. At first, all
I can talk about are things that have happened at the Castle,

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Terry, Edna, and Robin grow in their special meaning
for me. But the time spent with Joe is special in an entirely
different way. He comes over for dinner almost every
evening, and we begin to share our thoughts and hopes
about the future--a future which, without ever saying it
explicitly, always revolves around Joe and Marie being
together.


Earlier on, when Joe had asked me out on our first date
and had taken me to the movies, I could barely move--I
was so nervous. I had no idea what to do on a date. When
he leaned over to hold my hand, I was appalled and
refused. Oh, I certainly wanted him to hold my hand ...
and put his arm around me, but in relationships with men
I was still very much influenced by the strict rules of Ma
and Pa: touching a man you weren't married to was "bad."


Gently, but patiently, Joe tried again to hold my hand,
and when I continually rebuffed him, he whispered,
"Don't worry, Marie ... don't be so worried. I'd never
take advantage of a girl like you."


Joe and I are made for each other--we let each other
know that. Married very young and divorced soon after
his two children were born, Joe's very sensitive toward
my inexperience with men. Never pushing me, never
grabbing at me, he patiently shows me how to trust him.

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My work at Hunt Hospital is only an interim job. I
realize I have to get more education to achieve my goal of
working with the mentally ill. With Edna and Joe's
encouragement, I register for my first college course in the
evening division of North Shore Community College. I
have no idea if I can pass, so I decide to start at the bottom,
taking a basic course in English Composition. The college
is just a ten-minute walk from my apartment, but the night
the teacher is to hand back the first assignment, I walk very
slowly. It's taken me half an hour to get there! I can't look
at the grade, and wait until I return home. An "A"! I jump
around the apartment, shouting joyfully, "An ‘A’! An ‘A’!
I guess I'm not brain-dead," I muse to myself.


At North Shore Community College, I meet Bill, a
Unitarian minister teaching at the college. When he learns
I want to get a college degree, he encourages me to become
a full-time student. Then Linda, his wife, wants to meet
me. She's a child guidance counselor who does volunteer
work with patients released from the Castle. Linda wants
to work with me--I guess it's unusual for a former patient
from the Castle to pursue a college education. But I get
angry. I don't want to meet her! I'm trying to break away
from the Castle and she'll be a barrier to that goal. It takes
some convincing from Bill about Linda's good intention
before I relent. And I'm glad I do because she and I become
good friends.

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A major obstacle to becoming a full-time student is
money--I have none. Linda takes me to the Massachusetts
Rehabilitation Commission to request financial aid. I'm
interviewed by a psychiatrist who grills me about my past
mental history. When he hears how many years I'd spent at
Sutton State, he's furious, "What are you doing here? Do
you really think you can go to college with our money and
your past record?!" He makes me feel like a criminal and
refuses even to consider my application for funding. Linda
meanwhile speaks with a social worker who scolds her for
bringing to the Commission the financial request of someone
with my mental health background. As Linda and I
drive home to my apartment, we're both crying. "How
can people be so cruel?" we ask each other. And we know
there is no justification. I'm getting angry. By the time we
reach my apartment, I'm no longer crying. I've decided:
"I'm going to college--without the Commission."


The next night after class, I meet with a college counselor.
For over an hour I talk with him about my past, how
little I've accomplished, how hopeless I'd felt as a patient in
the Castle, then stressing how much I've changed and my
resolve to go further. Fortunately, the counselor is also the
college financial officer. Before I leave his office I've completed
a financial aid application. Several days later, I
receive a work study grant. I can now attend North Shore
full time.


There's lots of good news to share with my friends. But
then my dear friend Robin suffers a terrible tragedy when
her husband dies of a massive heart attack at the age of
forty-two. It's a new feeling for me--my deep concern for
another human being's suffering. Well-versed in seeking
help from others, I'm now helping Robin. I do the best
I can and sometimes it seems to be not enough. But we

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A year after I've moved out of Sutton State to my own
apartment, my indefinite visit status expires and I'm
officially discharged. It's 1966 ... and I'm thirty-seven.
Nearly twenty years have passed since my first hospital
admission. I vow to work as hard as I can so that this time
I won't return. And I pray. I pray with all I have for God
to help and guide me in my plan.
