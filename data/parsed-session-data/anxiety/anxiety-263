Yes, it was with every good wish of our friends and professional
associates that we approached this problem in the two
weeks following the outbreak of war. I have titled this chapter
with part of a sentence of felicitation from Dr. William S. Middleton,
Dean of the Medical School, University of Wisconsin.
This letter will be reproduced later, as it well illustrates the forthright
human kindliness which everyone was displaying during
this period of blunt decision.


Since September of 1941 I had been corresponding half-heartedly
with the Procurement and Assignment Service of the
Office of Defense Health and Welfare Services. It certainly appeared
that this office was slow in accepting candidates for commission
in the Medical Corps. (It was not until January 19,
1942 that I received a letter from Dr. Sam F. Seeley, Executive
Officer. He stated in a form letter that "... all applications as
received will be sorted into groups which meet the specifications
of requisitions made on this office by the Surgeons General of
the Army and Navy. As soon as possible after the compilation
of lists of those available for immediate appointment, a letter
will be directed from this office to those individuals meeting
the requirements. At that time you will be notified by letter and
the necessary application blanks will be forwarded to you with
information as to your appearance for physical examination, and
the forwarding of the completed forms to the Surgeon General
for final action."


I decided to go to Chicago and interview medical men at the
headquarters of the Sixth Corps Area.

On Wednesday, 17 December 1941, Marion and I went to
Chicago; Marion was planning to do our Christmas shopping,
and I went shopping to find out what our future might be in
the army. The Sixth Corps Area (later, Sixth Service Command)
had set up what was known as the Illinois Military Area for
the purpose of surveying the state and procuring professional
men for service in the army. The office of the Illinois Military
Area was located in the United States Court House at Adams
and Clark streets, Room 252. I secured an interview with Major
Harold C. Lueth, who was at the time in charge of the area. (Dr.
Harold Lueth was later Dean of the Medical School, University
of Nebraska.)


Major Lueth listened patiently to my story; I believe that he
knew I was seeking out information from him. I told him of
my circumstances, of my age, of my civilian practice, and mentioned
my marital status. He seemed to attach little importance
to the fact that I was married and had a young son. In reply,
he stated that he had left a private practice and had four children.
Major Lueth appeared to be about forty years of age.


In answer to my questions Lueth stated that for every man
in the Medical Corps there would be about twelve more alongside
before the war was over. He stated that to the best of his
knowledge there would be some program of taking physicians
out of civilian practice and making them available for military
service. He believed that if we were in for a long war the Sixth
Corps Area would be requested to provide a maximum of ten
to twelve thousand physicians for the Medical Corps. In his
opinion, the matter of forming the Medical Corps Reserve was
entirely a personal decision but he gave me the impression that
the Medical Corps would eventually have some sort of conscription
to get the needed men.


Marion and I ate lunch that noon in the Loop. She told me
of her excellent purchases of Christmas gifts; I was uninterested
and very impatient to tell what I learned during the morning.
After I made a full report both agreed that the proper move
was to apply for a commission in the Medical Corps. We considered
every angle of the situation, but particularly we were

After lunch I again returned to the offices of the Illinois Military
Area and handed in my application. (The form is reproduced
in the appendix.) An appointment was given me for a
physical examination to be done at Room 901, United States
Post Office Building. Room 901 was the office of the General
Dispensary of The United States Army. I certainly did not
dream that I would later be stationed there as a medical officer
for eighteen months!


On December 18th I returned in the morning to Room 901
of the Chicago Post Office for my physical examination. In the
corridor of the building I met Raymond A. Hassinger, an accountant
for the H. D. Conkey Company, Mendota, Illinois.
Ray was in a good mood; he apparently was happy that he had
had the foresight to take considerable military training while in
school. The physical examination was a routine procedure; we
spent about three hours going through. I was given a cursory
general physical examination in a large examination room by
Major James Whitney Hall, who was later to become a very
good friend. I had two impressions of Hall â€” he was a fairly
brusque individual, and he was interested in interviewing each
candidate from the hinterlands about pheasant-hunting in their
part of the state. (The following year Jim and I had some fine
pheasant and quail hunts together.) The physical examination
ended with the taking of a chest film. I recall that I regretted
that my pectoral muscles did not bulge more. I was anxious to
impress everyone that I would make a good medical officer!


When reporting to the "clearance room" for study of my
physical examination report, I talked with Captain John H.
Olwin. I had met Captain Olwin the preceding day in the office
of Major Lueth. I told him of my civilian experience and of my
postgraduate work and asked him if these would be recognized
for an early promotion! He, of course, said that I should return
to the Illinois Military Area and that I should discuss the matter

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Upon my return to the offices of Major Lueth the thing
which impressed me was the change in the complexion of the
office in one day. Now there was a large sign on the entrance
door which read: "No Admission, Offices of the Illinois
Military Area." There was a desk in front of the door, and two
men at this desk inquired about my business. Because I had an
honest face and good intentions the clerk admitted me to the
offices. I awaited my turn to see Major Lueth. Finally, after an
hour, I sat down at his desk to discuss the chances of being commisioned
a captain. I didn't want to miss any bets. We were
about to begin the buckpassing when a group of girls with coffee
and doughnuts entered the room. The manner in which his
pupils dilated convinced me that the coffee and doughnuts appealed
to him more than the prospect of again talking with me.


"We're in the war now. A few days ago no one came to see
me. I didn't have a thing to do. Now men stand in line to see
me. Girls in blue uniforms bring coffee and doughnuts to my
desk. It's a great life. Have some doughnuts, Leach."


Major Lueth impressed me as being a pretty fine fellow. Not
because he had a uniform or a sign on his desk or that he was
interviewing a line of men. He impressed me because he was a
fine, straightforward physician who was willing to give his
every effort to aid the country during a critical time. I thought
it was a privilege to talk with him and to have coffee and doughnuts
served by the girls in blue.


"Well, Leach, I think you have had enough civilian experience
to at least apply for a captaincy. Of course it all
depends on what the Adjutant General thinks of your experience.
Offhand I would not hazard a guess as to whether
you would get it or not. Let's change the application anyhow."


It took Major Lueth almost an hour to find my file, which
had been lost in the shuffle. He had several secretaries out hunting
for it and then he was finally able to find it himself. So I

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I left the Windy City that night with a flurry of thoughts going
through my mind. I had made another decision, the consequences
of which no one could foresee. If we were to be involved in
a long war it appeared that I had committed professional suicide.
Who could return to civilian life at about forty years of age and
be able to come back? If we were involved in a short war it
would not be hard to return. Everything considered, a long war
seemed most probable.


Christmas was around the corner. Our son had an expectant
look in his eye. I am sure that our four-year-old had little
conception of what was in store for him. He did not realize that
a hectic four years awaited him. Later events proved that he
was in for his small share of moving and new experiences. And
events proved that he had adjustments to make. Mrs. Leach had
far more critical hours and days in store for her.


After a brief family conference over more coffee I went to
the office and wrote a letter to Dr. William S. Middleton, Dean
of the Medical School at the university.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_10561');">[note]</a><div id="_note_10561" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">? I requested his letter of recommendation to the Commanding General
of The Sixth Corps Area. Dr. Middleton's reply is shown in the Appendix.</div>
Dr. Middleton warmly
trusted that "your army service may be satisfactory." He gave
us some fortitude with "every good wish for this and all seasons."
