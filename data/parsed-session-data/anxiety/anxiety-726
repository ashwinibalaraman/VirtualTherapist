BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: I just got some awful news.
THERAPIST: Oh no.
CLIENT: My one paying client that just gave me a $2,000.00 retainer they're foreclosing on the condo I'm supposed to collect from. And the way the process works is you send the homeowner and the mortgage company notice that the last six months are due, you wait 30 days, you file a lawsuit, record the complaint with the registry, and you've perfected your lien in front of the mortgage company. Well they're auctioning off the property. I mean they took like two weeks to send me the check. They're auctioning off the property April 10. So the property will be auctioned off before we get a chance to perfect our super lien. We have a lien but it's behind the mortgage company. So not only is the condo fucked but I'm fucked and then it cuts out a lot of work that I would've been doing. [00:01:23]
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: So that seems how everything seems to be going these days.
THERAPIST: I'm sorry to hear that.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I'm still - the guy's in bankruptcy. The condo never got notice of the bankruptcy so there's really nothing that I could think of that's going to push this auction off other than someone swooping in and lending this guy money. Yeah. I just got that phone call 45 minutes ago an hour ago. [00:02:14] (Pause)
THERAPIST: How much income does that actually mean?
CLIENT: Well filing the lawsuit I mean that would've taken up probably close to $1,000.00 or more.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But at this point it's only going to be a couple hundred. And now I'm in the situation of not paying my landlord for March so I can pay for my football tickets. I'm just you know (pause). I seem to have no opportunities to get ahead, you know, just everything just falls apart at some point. [00:03:30] (Pause)
I woke up today and I was really anxious, really anxious and I was oh let me just check my voice-mail. I didn't check my voice-mail yesterday afternoon. (Pause) But at least my bank deal closing is still happening. It's still in the process because they're calling me asking me for stuff.
THERAPIST: Well good.
CLIENT: So they wanted the pay off and an updated title commitment which I just sent them the updated title commitment. And then, of course, the recycling truck is on my street so I'm just sitting there waiting, waiting, waiting. And then I tried to find a resident's spot and there really weren't any. I don't know which streets to go to. You know everything's so convoluted with one ways. It's probably better to stay away from [inaudible] and maybe go back more towards Central to try and find a spot instead of that way go that way because that is just a bunch of short streets that were all full. [00:05:15]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:05:15) and [inaudible] and all those were...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yep.
CLIENT: And I was hoping to get a spot in the shade for the dog. It hasn't gotten - it's still below 70; barely hovering around 70. I found a metered spot. There's a tree which if it had leaves would be protecting those cars from the sun, but I don't think in the 45 minutes I'm here that the dog's going to perish. But I wasn't planning on going to the office today, but my condo book is up in Pembroke, and I really should get out the notice just in case the foreclosure doesn't happen. And I don't know if I'm supposed to respond to the notice of the foreclosure. The treasurer doesn't have e-mail or fax. She's completely off the grid. So I don't know if I should wait until this foreclosure notice comes or just... (pause) I don't know if I have to give notice of our lien. It's just... (pause) I kind of planned things. I was going to go and get my car inspected today which I still can do, but I was going to... I don't even know what I was going to do today. [00:07:02] (Pause)
You know if the correct advice is to tell these people to cut their losses and save a few hundred dollars on me or you know... And I said well maybe he'll file bankruptcy, the check, and stop the foreclosure but he's already in bankruptcy and the court has approved him going forward with the auction. (Pause) I don't know if I should wait to get this notice from them to (pause)... I mean I guess I should send my regular notice out today just to get it out to get the 30 days counting for any reason the auction gets pushed back. [00:08:15]
Apparently this guy works for "Genevieve's". You know the lettuce people the salad that's in the supermarket.
THERAPIST: Oh maybe.
CLIENT: Like his best friend's dad owns the company or something like that. So I don't know if he's going to lend him the money. I doubt it. It's a mortgage from '07 for like 250 so he probably owes more than 250 because of the back payments, and attorney's fees, and whatnot. It's just a little condo in Amherst so it's probably worth less than that. I don't know. So I don't know if there's any room for... I mean I don't know if anyone's going to show up at the foreclosure to buy it. If the bank buys it they're not going to care about the... They're just going to pay what their lien is so it sucks. [00:09:27]
I really don't know how things work from the foreclosure end of things like if I have to give notice to the bank that's foreclosing that we have at least a lien because... It doesn't appear on title. It just automatically happens the fact that there's a master deed that puts everyone on notice that there are liens for condo fees. (Pause) I think we're basically screwed. And I don't know that my condo book, which is in Pembroke with my CD-ROM with all my forms, whether that addressing what happens in foreclosure. [00:10:37] (Pause)
I kind of just want to crawl back into bed. It's going to be too hot for that. My down comforter is leaking and theirs just down all over my apartment. The sheets it just sort of sticks to it. I probably should find the hole and fix it. [00:12:50] (Pause)
Of course, Buddy is the one that put the hole in it. (Pause) He's more trouble than he's worth.
THERAPIST: Is he?
CLIENT: Yeah, like a pain in the ass. (Pause) I wasted an hour yesterday watching that On Demand. There was a webinar on short sales and all it was, was this guy who was an attorney and then underwriting counsel for a title insurance company. And every time he told you that something wouldn't happen he gave you an example of how he got it done. It was just him beating his chest. It's like really because I - One of my title company seminars did short sales a couple years ago and it was so much better. They really talked about the issues and this guy was just telling you stuff that I mean a lot it I already knew. It's probably why I didn't think it was that impressive. There was really no practical advice to it. What a waste. It's not like I had anything else to do. [00:15:13] (Pause)
I got an e-mail from a guy who wants to visit our E&G; Chapter. I'm almost embarrassed to have visitors come by because so few people show up for those damn meetings. (Pause) I just got a knot in my stomach; perpetual knot in my stomach. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Well it sounds like everywhere you look and everything you try you feel like it falls apart. You get kind of fucked over. [00:16:20]
CLIENT: Yep. (Pause)
THERAPIST: And I think you got nervous about how frustrated or explosively angry it can make you. [00:17:05] (Pause)
CLIENT: It's just I don't know what to do. I'm just at a complete loss of what to do. And it's like I don't have people other than you that I can talk to. Jess's no help. I mean she had this crappy client who wasn't sending her money and she's trying to fire the guy and I'm like there telling her she's doing the right thing, whatever, but she just would never do that for me. She would just be like oh you've got it bad. And this is the moment she decides I've got to pay her $500.00 for the fucking kids. [00:18:39] (Pause)
Giving me shit about I'm not doing enough to get business. I should've said well what the fuck do you think I should be doing. I really should've. (Pause) I was trying to limit the confrontation. Actually I was kind of blown away by it. I'm still blown away by it. It's just... (pause) It's like I'm afraid to go... [00:19:39]
THERAPIST: Well that's exactly want you want; some help from her. And those no e-mails you should be doing. I mean as pissed are you are for her kind of accusation I think I would actually question you really want to know the answer to what the hell else could you be doing. [00:20:05] (Pause)
CLIENT: The guy who wants to come to visit our chapter he's been trying to get into the Port chapter which has 50 members. So it's going to be like night and day. Plus he's a contractor which I don't know. I mean they just don't last long at a lunch meeting. [00:22:41] (Pause)
Fucking (inaudible at 00:23:25) going to kill me tomorrow.
THERAPIST: Cameron, how much do you feel like you're fucking up?
CLIENT: You know that's the thing it's like I don't feel like I'm doing that much wrong. I'm not blaming myself. (Pause) I'm like why? Why is all this happening to me? [00:24:07]
I mean I have no control of the E&G; chapter falling apart. I have no control over how bad real estate is or... (pause) I mean I fucked up with the credit card debt and all that stuff, and wasted all the years I was making money just throwing good money after bad, but now that that's off my back it's like nothing's happening for me. (Pause) I mean I think I catch a break when $600.00 falls in my lap, but... (pause) And I was wiped out quickly. I should've just signed the check over to the vet. [00:25:33] (Pause)
The IRS called me yesterday. (Pause) I still have to fucking do all of that paperwork. Maybe that's what I was supposed to be doing today. It's just... (pause) I feel kind of upset because today was a half day in Ian's school, but Jess's taking the kids to see her friend Erica. It's like that's why I want to take Ian to school tomorrow because I never see the kid. I haven't seen him since Saturday. [00:26:42]
THERAPIST: Can you go along with him this afternoon?
CLIENT: No. (Pause) It's not something I should be inviting myself to and I know I'm not exactly welcome. [00:27:14] (Pause)
I was supposed to take both kids in the morning tomorrow but Jess fired the client that she was supposed to go to Concord for.
THERAPIST: Is she going to take Lucille? [00:28:03]
CLIENT: So she's going to take Lucille to daycare which is fine with me. I mean I get to see her for two minutes. I'll get to Pembroke quicker and try and get some work done before E&amp;G.; (Pause) I talked to my dad yesterday and it's like I can't have a conversation with him without him bringing up how I should be doing divorce like it's just relentless. He bitches that I never call him, and I call him and try to tell him the things I'm doing to try to get my business back on track and he's like don't forget divorce. [00:29:37] (Pause)
THERAPIST: Just because it's not really working yet doesn't mean you're doing the wrong stuff.
CLIENT: No I know that. (Pause)
THERAPIST: I always wondered... It does seem to me that you have a clear idea of what you need to be doing, what makes sense for you to be doing, than your dad would or Jess would. [00:31:17]
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean Jess does nothing that builds her practice. She really does. She relies on estate work and then whatever calls she gets from either the website or from past clients referring her. She doesn't go to chamber events. She doesn't do any networking whatsoever except with other attorneys, divorce attorneys from (inaudible at 00:32:12). It's frustrating when she runs into an attorney she knows it's like she gets lost in some fucking conversation, but she won't tell the parents at Ian's school what she does. She never takes the opportunity to plug her business. [00:32:40] (Pause)
And she just went over to Erica's like two Friday's ago. She keeps bringing it up well while you have nothing to do you could be doing whatever. She doesn't even consider a half day of having me spend time with Ian. (Pause) And Erica doesn't work. She refuses to come into Plymouth. I mean refuses. It's like... (pause) [00:33:52]
Like I don't know if I'm crazy running up to Pembroke to do this thing or if I should just put it off until morning or tomorrow. I just don't know. I mean I've got to get certified mail out. (Pause) I've got some lawyer calling me. I think he was a guy who was trying to sell me software for estate planning; you know multi-thousand dollar software you pay a year. It's not like you pay for it once and then... [00:35:39]
THERAPIST: I see like a subscription.
CLIENT: Yeah you keep... Well like my closing software I pay $165.00 a quarter for me and support and updates. But you've got to pay several grand every year $3,000.00 to $4,000.00. And he was just trying to sell that for a while and now I got a message that he's opening up his own law practice again and he wants to talk to me. [00:36:13] (Pause)
I just wonder why things work out for other people and not for me. (Pause) I've got money coming in $150.00, $175.00 at a time once a week, maybe twice a week, maybe once every two weeks. It's just I can't make it on that. I just can't make it. [00:38:27] (Pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah you really can't. [00:39:14] (Pause)
CLIENT: I barely see my kids. [00:40:16]
THERAPIST: Yeah I didn't know that. I mean I know you see Ian on Friday's right and on the weekends. I thought you were more involved during the week but that's changed.
CLIENT: Yeah it has and I don't know why. It was picking him up, hanging out in the afternoon, and I'd get him on Saturday, but they went over on Sunday, and I haven't seen the kids this week. It's just... (pause)
THERAPIST: Are you sad about it? [00:41:09]
CLIENT: A little bit. I sit in my apartment alone with the dog, in here. My landlord, their bathroom must be right up against my wall because I hear them screaming and yelling and having a good time in the bath every night. I just... (pause) I used to dread Ian's bedtime routine. I don't know why. I just didn't want to be a part of it. Now I'm just you know. I don't know. (Pause)
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:42:18) stop. Again, you (inaudible at 00:42:24) kids can't you? [00:42:24]
CLIENT: Yeah, but I mean it's not like they're being denied to me but it's like my schedule doesn't match up with them. I mean I'll see them tomorrow. I intentionally had the vet come to Plymouth so Ian could be there to...
THERAPIST: I see. Help out. Sure. I'll see you on Tuesday. Let me know if anything comes up before then. [00:43:11]
