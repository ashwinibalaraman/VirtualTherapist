BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: [Sound of something sliding, adjusting microphone]
CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:02] ...You won't get fussy.
THERAPIST: So how have you been?
CLIENT: Good! I feel like I've done OK up until last night, and I know I've been, like, anticipating this week.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Um, but it was nice 'cause we were on vacation with my family, and we spent some time with Todd's family, too. We were just in Canada.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And there were tons of people everywhere. We were with my mom and my grandmother, who was in Indiana — the gambling one [chuckles] that you know of.
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: So we got to see her again, and that was nice 'cause he doesn't get to see her a lot of the time.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And there was — we go on this trip. Um, it is the second week in August. We've been going with a whole group of families since I was like four or five years-old.
THERAPIST: Oh, wow.
CLIENT: So it is really like a fun vacation, and he got to meet so many people whom he hadn't met before. And so I feel like that was something we were looking forward to...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ....And it was really fun, and it ended up like throwing his schedule off a lot, which we realized.
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: All of the sudden, like, "Oh, when he doesn't nap during the day, he doesn't sleep, either." [00:01:00]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So I feel like that part was a little tricky because we had a bunch of sleepless nights in a row just 'cause I think there were so many people around to play with, and he was like totally overstimulated.
THERAPIST: Right, mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: And he's old enough now that he's got a bit of a routine.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I know. We're just starting to figure it out, but yeah, definitely, that made it a little tricky. But it was also helpful to have so many people around because I feel like I was able to get a little bit of work done, too, which is still weighing on me.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So my mom was so good. Like, I would feed him, and she'd take him out for a walk, and so I was able to just get like some chunks of time. Um, so that was really nice to have that time away even though it was a little stressful just with like not getting more sleep. Um, but now I feel like I've been kind of anticipating this week. Like — and I feel like I'm — like, I know that I'm putting too much on it and I feel like I'm putting this pressure on myself to have this, like, blissful week with him...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...As, like, my last week. [Taps surface] And already, I know there's too much pressure on that... [00:02:01]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I think all summer I was worried, like, that I don't have work left to do with my finals, and I didn't really want that...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...To kind of take away from this last week with him. And I still have a ton of work left to do, so I feel like it is kind of what I was dreading. Like, I feel like I'm feeling emotional, like going back to school, and that's one piece of it, but then I'm also feeling like this other kind of pressure about trying to finish my work. And it is like this weird feeling because part of me wants — like, my mom is, you know, saying she can take him for one day, or Todd is trying to be really proactive, and one of his students is a former nanny, so he was like, "She could come and watch him for the day." And I feel like people are trying to <i>help</i>...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And part of me wants to be like, "Yes! Like, I need a whole day. Take him!"
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But then another part of me doesn't want to give him up for a whole day because I know, next week, we're going to, like — next week will be nice 'cause I think we're going to kind of ease into it.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It won't be like jumping totally back into it 'cause classes won't have started yet. [00:03:02]
[Baby Trae begins to fuss]
CLIENT: But it is like this weird tension that I'm feeling now, like part of me just wanting a <i>huge</i> chunk of time to just, like, get this off of my chest.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Like, I feel like, now, it is kind of like weighing on me. Like, I just want it to be done and...
THERAPIST: What do you have left?
CLIENT: I'm getting close. Like, I feel like, um, I almost have a whole draft of that action research part of it I've been working on with the teacher.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But I have <i>so</i> much data, 'cause I've been collecting stuff over the whole year...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And I'm kind of thinking that it could become more than just this final paper, like it could lead to my qualifying paper. So it is <i>huge</i>.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And it is just like it has been fun to kind of play around with the data and like see all of this stuff, but it is like — it feels like this big challenge right now to narrow it down to just this little 25-page paper for the class...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Knowing that it could be something really big later.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I feel like that's one chunk. And then my, um — the other one that's due just kind of builds off of that one, so I just need to finish that action research project. [00:04:04]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And then, the third one, I'm just making like an online kind of website that gives resources and stuff for my collaborating teacher.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So that one I'm not...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...As worried about. And I have most of the content developed. I feel like that — I could almost do it while he's around 'cause it would be more just like copying, pasting content into a website.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: That one, I'm not as worried about. But this action research one — like...
THERAPIST: Right, 'cause you're not just writing that paper, but you're also imagining what could...
CLIENT: ....It could be. And it is just like lots of — I just feel like, now, it is like trying to put the pieces together and figure out what's important for this paper, but what do I want [baby begins to fuss] to hold onto for the future and things like that. So [baby fusses] I definitely — I was thinking over the walk here I'm in much better shape than the last time I was here in terms of that project.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, I've gotten [baby continues to fuss] a lot more done, but it <i>is</i> just a little daunting, knowing the little chunks of two hours that — I feel like people have been so helpful in trying to give me...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:04:58]
CLIENT: ...I almost feel like those little chunks aren't quite what I need to just <i>wrap</i> it up and be <i>done</i> with it. You know? Like — and I think I've been — before, maybe, he was even born, I had this expectation that, "Oh, I'll be able to work over the summer. Like, I'll turn them in by the beginning of August so I'll have a nice chunk of time without anything kind of weighing over me."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I feel like I've been good. Like, I've tried to separate working on that from being with Trae, so I don't feel like it has really overshadowed, like, our time at home together during the summer.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But it is <i>there</i>. And then part of me is a little annoyed because, now, I feel like I'm — I'm going to be working up to the very last second, and then school is going to start, and I won't have had that chance to just have that little rebound of, like, "Oh!..."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, with nothing to do.
CLIENT: ..."I have absolutely nothing that I really need to do right now." So that's been like...
THERAPIST: And you seem disappointed.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I feel like I see disappointment behind your eyes.
CLIENT: I do. I feel — well, looking back on it, I almost feel like, should I have been more proactive and, like, taken a week during July or something, and like wind up like days — back-to-back dates to just... [00:06:05]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I feel like, now, my strategy of kind of like not worrying about pumping and doing the two-hour increments just has made it a little bit harder for myself. And I just don't want, like, this week to feel pressure.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And already, last night, I was thinking about it before I went to bed, and talking to Todd about it, and feeling like there was, like, this — but two kinds of pressure, like pressure that I'm putting on myself, that I want to really spend lots of time with him, [baby coos] and then another kind of pressure of, like, needing [baby fusses] to just get this done. You know. [Baby fusses] So I feel like [becomes emotional] [pauses] all emotional. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. So I don't know. I didn't know I was going to cry coming [becomes emotional, voices shakes] here. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: It is OK.
CLIENT: [Crying] OK, good. [Chuckles] Oh, [sniffles] and I was talking to Todd about it last night, too, and my mom, so I feel like everyone kind of knows [crying] that — I think, like, the biggest piece of it, which is kind of nice — like, I feel like, before, I would have been crying over finals [chuckles while crying]... [00:07:02]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...And now I think I'm more crying just over the idea of going back. [Continues crying] So it is kind of nice that, already, I kind of see that my priorities [chuckles] are changing; like, I don't feel like [sniffles] — but, um, [pauses] finishing my finals [voices shakes] does feel like this weight, but I feel like more of the weight is just knowing that, like, we won't really have our time together being [crying] together. [Sound of something rubbing together] [Whimpers, cries] I [inaudible at 07.28]...
THERAPIST: What do your tears mean?
CLIENT: [Crying] [sniffles] I think I'm just kind of sad to [pauses] go back, and I feel like I've enjoyed this summer so much that, [sniffles] um, I'm sad that it'll be over, but I also think like what we talked about the last time. I feel like I'm [pauses] — and I was talking to my mom about this, too, and Todd — like putting this sense of, like, finality on it all when that's really not the case.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Like, it is not like I get to stop being a [chuckles] mom after, like, this week.
THERAPIST: No, you're still his mom. [00:07:57]
CLIENT: You know, like — and I know, like, I should just focus on — that I have Fridays at home with him, too, like that I'm really lucky to even have <i>that</i>, that I don't have to go back full-time. [Taps surface] But I do just feel like [pauses] — I guess 'cause it is kind of like a transition, too, and that I really enjoyed this, and now I'm knowing that I'm going [sing-song, emotional] back, and things will change, and I think — I think that's what it is all kind of [shakily] boiling down to. And I have just like been anticipating it for so long, too.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, I feel like I have, all along, been really good about being aware that I am so lucky to have all of this time with him...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...But kind of knowing, like, "Oh, it is going to be really hard for me to go back." And now, like, here it is, and I feel like, "It <i>is</i> h-h-hard!" So [pauses] [sniffles]...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, it is a big shift because you've met — you haven't — you will always be his mom...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...But you haven't been a mom in the way that you're about to be.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So far, you've been a mom that had [working in her head] (ph) but didn't get to show up and instigate (ph) a time for it.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And now it is going to be a new kind of something. [00:08:57]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. [Sniffles] And I think I just get really — like, knowing what kind of student I am and that, like, I put so much pressure on myself to do well in school...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...And I feel like I want — I don't want that, like, same student mentality to carry over.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Like, and I feel like I kind of know that it is not going to, but I don't — I don't want to get back into my old habits of being so stressed out at school and coming home and feeling stressed out about all the work I have to do.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I want to [sound of something closing] be at school and come home, and spend time with Trae and Todd, and be our little family.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I think that is a little part of it, too, is just like not quite sure [sound of something banging in background] how I'll be able to balance it all. I'm not quite sure how I'm going to respond to being back in school and worry that, like, I'll slip into my own — old ways, when I really...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...Don't want to do that again. [Sound of something banging in background] And I feel like — part of me feels like I won't because my priorities, [lightly claps hand] I feel like, <i>have</i> already shifted a lot.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But I think that is just like a little nerve-wracking to [baby begins to fuss] be thinking about that. [00:10:01]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And, like, just worried about how I'll balance it all, just knowing what kind of student I was in the past. [Pauses] Yeah. [Sniffles] But it does make me feel better knowing, like, even talking to Todd last night, and he was saying when he went back to work, he was like, "I felt really sad about it, too."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: He was like, "You're definitely not alone in this." And I feel like, with the moms' group, too, it is a little comforting to know that I feel like this is another kind of worry that is on the normal [chuckles] side...
THERAPIST: Yes.
[Baby fusses]
CLIENT: I think.
THERAPIST: Absolutely, perfectly normal for you to be [pauses] feeling conflicted...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And feeling worried about how you're going to handle it.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You don't know what shape it is going to take yet.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Um, you know, what might be a little bit different for you is that you're not fully trusting yourself that you're going to — that you're going to cope with it in a way that feels appropriate.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Taps surface]
THERAPIST: Whereas someone without your history of anxiety might feel conflicted about going back and might not know what shape it is going take, but might not be worried about that. [00:11:07]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it is <i>totally</i> normal for you to be worried about it. And what I would like for you — I wish for you would be that you could not know what it is going to look like but know that you are going to be OK with it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you'll [pauses] get there.
CLIENT: Yeah.
[Sound of something banging in the background]
THERAPIST: And you'll see — you'll see what happens, and will pay attention to how you're feeling and how you feel about how you're balancing...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And make adjustments if you need to...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...Or find ways to help you let go of work and leave work at work.
CLIENT: Right. 'Cause I do — I really want to be good at that. You know, I feel like that's important and that's what I kind of envision what the ideal scenario would be. Like, <i>that's</i> what is going to make me [taps surface] feel good as a mom, to know that, like, I can just leave that work at school and just be done with it, and be able to come home and enjoy him. And I feel like I'll be disappointed with myself if there is that, like, I'll get home and feel like, "Ahh, there's all this stuff I didn't finish," and I don't know how I'll react. Like, will I just be in a bad mood [chuckles] about it, or will I feel like, "Oh, maybe Todd can take him, and I'll try and get it done," or once he goes to sleep or something like... [00:12:12]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I don't want that; I want to just come home and enjoy him.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] So [pauses] — but it is, like it is all stuff that I can't really see into the future anyway, so...
THERAPIST: Right, until you do it.
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses] And then there's a part of me, too, that's like excited to go back. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: It would be a really exciting experiment for you. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah, cool. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Oh, let's see how...
CLIENT: Those always — like, remember what — it is so funny, something about that brand.
THERAPIST: It is not — it is not a big enough bottle.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: [Saying here but not now this full] (ph)
CLIENT: [Chuckles] [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: You're [learning about carbonation] (ph).
CLIENT: Yes. [Pauses] It is in the experiment. [Sniffles] [sound of clicking]
THERAPIST: No volcano. Like it is a... [00:13:01]
CLIENT: Oh, wow. [Chuckles] Maybe next time.
THERAPIST: So what you'd have about being a good mom — what is that from you? How will you — what will make you feel like you were a good mom?
CLIENT: I think — and, already, I know, like, that he will come first over school, but I think that that's going to be kind of like a [pauses] transition for me because, before he was born, like not that my family didn't come first or Todd didn't come first, but we — Todd and I both, like, were invested in [baby begins to fuss]...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...He was finishing up his dissertation and I was starting school — like we both — that was like a big chunk of our day...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And then we got to come home to each other and — and be with each other. But like a <i>huge</i> focus of my day was just [pauses] <i>working</i>.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And so I feel like [sniffles] I don't — I don't <i>want</i> it to be like that with him now.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And so I think it is just trying to [pauses] figure that out and just make sure that — I think what I have lined up for school will feel manageable, but that's like another piece of it, too — is just like once I'm in there, I don't — once I'm into the swing of it, I just hope that feels, um, like I will be able to have some kind of balance. [00:14:13]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I think the way I have it lined up, I do think that it will be OK, but it is just all that [taps surface] kind of anticipation I'm not quite sure how...
THERAPIST: Right, not knowing [that is...] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not quite sure how it is going to feel and — yeah. [Sniffles] But I do feel like there's part of me that is excited to go back, too. Like, I feel like I'm not totally dreading it, either; you know, that it is — there've been e-mails going back and forth, like with [our Cobra] (ph) and people trying to get together and — like, there's lots to look forward to, too.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that is exciting.
CLIENT: And I think some of the classes that I'm tak — going to take — well, all of them are ones that I really want to take, like it just kind of happened that I don't really have any number of courses I <i>have</i> to take this semester, but there's three being offered...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...That I think are going to be really great. And so I feel like there's — there are things to look forward to, too. [00:15:00]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It is not like I'm going back to this terrible situation that I don't want to be going to.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, so I feel like I need to focus on that, too.
THERAPIST: Yeah, and that it is OK to be excited about going back.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: That doesn't mean that he's not a priority...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...It just means that you also have these other interests.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. And I was happy I ran into a [another mom] (ph). It was so funny that we met, like, when our babies were maybe one or two weeks old at that.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: That's the baby (ph) support group. And she said that she's already back at work, and she's like, "Honestly, I was so ready to go back."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: We just — She's like, "I realize I wasn't meant to be a stay-at-home mom. I enjoyed my time, but..."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: "...You know, it was nice to get back into the work life." And I feel like I'm not feeling totally ready to be like, "Oh, yeah, I'm done with this damn whole mom business..."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...But I do feel like there's [taps surface] part of me that has had that sense of excitement, too, to get back into...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Into my schoolwork and stuff. So...
THERAPIST: Yeah, a place that's really familiar...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And a place that's held a lot of meaning for you, for a long time? [00:16:00]
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses] But it won't just be different. Like, it is just hard — I feel like...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...It will be like a new <i>me</i> to figure out what is this student/mom instead...
THERAPIST: [You're not just a student but a mother, too] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah, instead of just being a student, I guess.
THERAPIST: You have one more role.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because you used to juggle being a wife...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And being a friend, and being a daughter, um...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...And being a student, and now you have this other role...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...To add to the mix.
CLIENT: [Pauses] Yeah, which is like exciting. You know, like I — it feels like — I don't know — like, I feel such mixed feelings about it.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, it is so fun to go back knowing, like, "Oh, I'm back at school and I'm a <i>mom</i>."
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like, I get to go home to my <i>baby</i> after this. You know, that's exciting then to think, like, I hope I do a good job at [slaps surface] all of this, too. [Pauses] And I think that Todd — like, he was saying the same thing, just trying to figure out — like, he was — and even before I was talking to him about feeling sad about going back, he was saying how it was hard for him to go back to work...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And just trying to figure out what <i>his</i> balance is going to be and how he can be — feel like, you know, he's there for me and for Trae, but also being able to feel like a doctor about work... [00:17:10]
THERAPIST: ...Work.
CLIENT: ...And trying to figure out that balance.
THERAPIST: How do you feel like he does balancing it?
CLIENT: I think he's done a really good job. I think he — he knew, like, for the summer, he could kind of let work slide a little bit...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...So he was able to have his hours be more flexible. And I think there's a little piece of him that feels a little nervous just with the real school.
[Crosstalk]
THERAPIST: Mm, [inaudible at 17:30]...
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah, yeah. So I think things will be different for him, too, 'cause I think, once September starts, like...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...There isn't as much, like, [freedom around] (ph) where he can kind of go in late or come home early and things like that.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, but I do feel like he's done an <i>awesome</i> job, and he does a good job of coming home and, like, turning it off, too, and that, I feel like, has been a good model for me of that's what I want to do, too.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, he's got a little bit exper — a little bit more experience from you...
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
THERAPIST: ...Juggling it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: [Be there for] (ph) each other. [00:18:00]
CLIENT: Right, so I think that will be helpful, too, that it is nice to know we're kind of in it together, too.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, it is not just me trying to figure this out on my own, too.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Mm, you have a lot of support, both with him and also with your mom.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Taps surface]
THERAPIST: And, you know, being able to have some flexibility in the first week where it won't be jumping right into fuller...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ....Full schedule, and getting <i>used</i> to it with all three (ph) of you.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that's been hard, too, 'cause I just was kind of thinking of, next week, like, my mom will just do — I'll just need my mom for one day and Todd's mom for one day, and then we're going to go visit the daycare. And so I was kind of thinking of next week as, like, "Oh, it will be nice." Like, my mom can come, and we can — like, already, I've been kind of showing our nanny little things to do around the neighborhood with Trae and stuff...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And I was, like, oh, we could go to the library [baby begins to coo] and do all of this stuff. [Aside to baby] That was a good yawn (ph). [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Tired (ph)? [Chuckles]
CLIENT: But then I'm thinking, too, like, or is she going to come to watch Trae, and am I going to be like running to the library to try and finish these finals, too? [00:19:03]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: You know, like, I was also thinking of next week is like a nice week to really focus on transitioning him...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Too, and now I'm thinking — like, before, I was like, "Oh it is great that Jen is coming. It is great that my mom will come [sound of rubbing something] 'cause we'll have these days to just like practice...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Getting the car seat into the stroller and all that kind of stuff.
THERAPIST: But they've <i>done</i> some of this stuff.
CLIENT: And they have, yeah.
THERAPIST: But they've taken him...
CLIENT: Yeah, actually...
THERAPIST: It is not like he hasn't been left with them before. You've been with them.
CLIENT: Right, yeah, exactly. And my mom and I were joking that being in Canada together was like perfect timing 'cause she did get to practice all those things.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, they got to — yeah, a lot. And he got a lot of face time with people that he will...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...He will be with during the day.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, so I feel like it — like, I think maybe that is just more me, like, wanting to like go over all that when they don't really need to. [Chuckles] But it — I think that's another, like, downside of just still having this work hanging over me, is that instead of that being like our relaxing week to like transition him, I'm not quite sure how much time I'll get this week. And will I have to use those days when I <i>do</i> have care for him, to be, like, scrambling to finish? [Baby begins to fuss a little] [00:20:07]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So [pauses] — and I <i>do</i> feel like it is nice. Like, I don't feel [lightly claps hand] — I think, before, I would have felt like this pressure to have this final paper for action research be perfect, and I almost don't want to care as much about the paper. I just know, like, going forward, it <i>could</i> be something important...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...So I don't want to just — I feel like I <i>do</i> need to put my time into it 'cause it is not something that is kind of like you're doing it just to do it and then the course is over, and you're never going to go back to it.
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 20:36]
CLIENT: Yeah. So I feel like that's a little more — not like putting bad pressure on it, but like making mistakes a little higher.
THERAPIST: It gives you a little bit — it gives it a little bit more importance.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: However, the paper that you write now — like, the information that you've gathered you will use again.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But the paper you write now is not going to be the paper that you would use for your qualifying paper.
CLIENT: Right, no.
THERAPIST: You might move sections.
CLIENT: Right. [Sound of moving] [00:21:00]
THERAPIST: But I don't think you need — you don't have to make it the perf — it doesn't have to be the perfect paper even to jump off of.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What you want to make a note of — you've already noted this is a lot of data, this is something that I could turn into my qualifying paper.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Slaps surface] Put a star on the folder.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Um, and then that — that's all you need to do for that right now.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And then you write the paper as the paper for this <i>class</i>, and — you know? — put it in the folder to <i>save</i>.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You know? "Look <i>back</i> at when I'm writing my qualifying paper."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You don't need to be writing pieces of the qualifying paper now.
CLIENT: Yeah, I just need to...
THERAPIST: You can do that when you're used to daycare and when you're used to [chuckles]...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But, I mean, you've noted that there is good stuff there, and...
CLIENT: Right, which is exciting. [I've never felt excited to] (ph)...
THERAPIST: Yeah, it is good stuff. You know that it will be waiting for you, and it is not going anywhere.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [Sniffles] Right. But I do feel like, it is just now a matter of just getting it <i>done.</i>
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: So...
THERAPIST: And that's — that's maybe part of setting — setting the expectations for yourself a little bit differently this year than maybe in the past. [00:22:03]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.
THERAPIST: In the past, you wanted it to be perfect; now you want it to be done.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And it — well, done well.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Sound of rubbing something]
THERAPIST: But it doesn't — they don't do perfect.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I <i>do</i> kind of — like, I was thinking more about that, and it is almost like, now, I have like a — not like an out but like this feeling of...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Like, it is OK if it is not perfect because I'm a mom and I want... [Baby begins to fuss]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, if I want to be spending time with Trae, and...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
[Baby continues to fuss]
CLIENT: ...So it is not perfect, that's OK.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: [Baby fusses] And I was thinking before, I wonder if I put so much pressure on — on it to be perfect — on my work to be perfect 'cause I just saw myself as a full-time student, like I had the time to make it perfect.
THERAPIST: That was where most of your identity was based on.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: And that fine for that phase of your life...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Until it got — until it created more anxiety and it was healthy for you...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But so much of your identity and how you judged yourself...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Was based on what your academic performance was. [00:23:00]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And, now, you've changed the definition a little bit of what — what makes you who you are...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...Of what makes you important...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And what you value about yourself in being a good student, and setting yourself up for your career is important, but there are other things that are also important.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, the way that you look at them.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: It would be just like if you had three exams and a paper, and they'd all be weighted differently. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles] Yeah. So I think that is just like a whole different way of seeing things, and I think it will be so <i>good</i> for me. But just, like, anticipating it all is just...
THERAPIST: Yeah...
CLIENT: ...Hard.
THERAPIST: Trusting that you will — you will be able — that you'll be able to just kind of sit with it as you figure out how to do it, too.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And give yourself some permission not to have it all figured out the first week.
CLIENT: Yeah. And, usually, the semester kind of eases in, anyway, so I think that will be good.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And...
THERAPIST: And you will be different at different parts of the semester, and that's OK.
CLIENT: Yeah, mm-hmm. [Fidgets with an object]
THERAPIST: Like, there may be times that it is not balanced... [00:24:02]
CLIENT: [Fidgets with an object] Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And that's OK. Balance doesn't have to happen every single day.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Balance is what comes over the course of time.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: So one week might be a week where you spend lots of great time with him, and another week might be a week that you don't, and you spend much more time in work.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And then there'll be weeks that you feel more equally balanced. And giving yourself some permission to sit with that flexibility...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...So that you don't have to judge yourself too harshly on any one given day or one given week...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...It is going to be OK to have some fluctuation with the semester...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...Or with your mood. You know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You may have a different level of patience one week than another...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Like, whether it be for him or for class, or for both.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. So all — all of these things that I just have to wait and see how it all goes.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. This is hard.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Really, I think you'll do OK. [00:24:59]
CLIENT: I think so. Like, I think I — I do feel confident going into it. Like, I do feel like I'll be able to figure it out, but I think it is just...
THERAPIST: Yeah, you've met a lot of challenges already.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like, the anticipation of it all, I think — and because I have been anticipating this time in the summer for so long, just kind of knowing that I was going to...
THERAPIST: Right, you had that picture in your head of what it was going to be like.
CLIENT: Yeah, and kind of worried that it would come down to what it has come down to.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: You know, like, I really didn't want to have work left at this point in the summer, and just the way things panned out, I do.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I think that was like — it has just been a little disappointing that I won't just have this week...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...To just play and have the summer — and into the summer.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But — and I'll try to be more like a balance of trying to play and then find time to just get it done.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Maybe picking one — like, one particular thing that you want to go and do with him, like one particular walk that you really like...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Or picking something so you feel like you have that moment. [00:26:01]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And it might not be the whole week...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...But that you do have some things that kind of crystallize for you what the summer <i>has</i> been...
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: ...A lot of the days have been.
CLIENT: Yeah, pick — I was already trying to think of that — like a little list of all the things [sniffles] that we can do, and like the little groups we've been going to and stuff like that...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...To make sure we get back to the moms' group, though, because I probably won't be able to go to that once school starts out, so I'll get to that one last time.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And there was the little infant playgroup we've been going to, so I feel like it will be fun to fit all of those things in.
THERAPIST: Yeah. And, I mean, watching your words to yourself because you must do this one last time, you will — it is not forever.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Sound of rubbing something]
THERAPIST: Um, there will be other things that you do together with him...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...That might not be the same infant playgroup, but he's not going to be an infant forever.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You know what I'm saying?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So I think you — you might go to one last of <i>that</i> group, but it is not the last time you're going to go to a playgroup with him. [00:27:00]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And it is not the last time you're going to take a walk, and it is not the last time you're going to, you know, [slaps surface] and — do anything. All of these things are going to come around again and again and again in...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...A different shape or a different form.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: This isn't — this isn't the end.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I need to get over that. Like, I really do feel like I've just, like, projected to this week of, like, "Oh, we have to fit everything in 'cause it is the last week before school is on your plate."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I feel like that's not really being fair to myself...
THERAPIST: Right, and in some...
CLIENT: ... [To bow to] (ph) having the pressure.
THERAPIST: Right, and in some ways, it is the last week before school is on your plate. You will go back to school; that is true.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Um, but it is not the last time you're going to, you know, have playtime with him.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Um, and I think since we don't know how different it is going to feel, it might not feel that different on a Saturday.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Sound of rubbing something]
THERAPIST: Right? And to think part of you is imagining that it is going to feel really different when you're home with him now that you're in school... [00:28:00]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...And that might be true some of the time, but it might not be true all of the time.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: There may be times when you really <i>do</i> [pauses] leave work at work, and a Saturday or a Thursday night or — feels very much like that feels now.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And that might not be so different.
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses] Yeah, so that's good to [pauses] think of, too — that maybe it won't all totally feel like it is all changed.
THERAPIST: Yeah, 'cause like one thing that I have seen for me this summer is how good of a job you did at letting yourself be in the moment.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And that skill carries over really nicely because, when you're in the moment, then it doesn't matter what you did in the moment before and the moment after. That's where you're not split between being a student and being a mom.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Since you have really practiced being in the moment and being engaged with where you are right then, then you're just a mom and you're "Mom"...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And you are just a student, and you're a student. There will be times when you're in class having discussion that you're not going to be thinking about whether or not he's [well at home] (ph). [00:29:06]
CLIENT: Right. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: And that's tot — you know, that's 'cause you're in the moment, [sound of a bang on an object] you're being fully focused on where you are at that moment, and you'll have that in all of the different phases of where you are.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And then there will be other times when you're totally split, and a million different thoughts going on in your head at once, and you're sort of in three different places at once, and that will be some of the time [baby coos loudly] [inaudible at 29:27]...
CLIENT: Right. [Aside to baby] Let's get you another toy. Yeah, and I <i>do</i> feel like I've — it is nice to know I've felt better about that, this summer anyway. [Pauses] [Fidgeting with objects, probably looking for a toy] [Aside to baby] There's some stuff in here. [Whispers] Here [you are] (ph). Here. [Handling something] [Chuckles] [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: Now he's a little bit more merry (ph). [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] He's finding ways to put everything into his mouth.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It is so funny. [00:30:00]
THERAPIST: Now he's pretty quick. One misfire and...
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
[Silence for seven seconds]
CLIENT: [Aside to baby] [Whispers] There. [Sniffles] So I feel like that's like the [chuckles]...
THERAPIST: That's the biggest thing.
CLIENT: ...The biggest thing. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: That is — that's big enough to handle.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You don't need anything other than that.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] And I do — I've felt like I was good about kind of like putting it out of my mind, too, and...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, it surfaced a little bit when we were in, um — on vacation with my family. [Sound of something banging an object] Like, there was something — I don't even remember what it was - that I felt like frustrated about, and Todd was like, "What's going on?" [Taps surface]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And what — I don't even remember; it was something silly — and he could tell. It was like, "That's not — I don't know. What's going on? You're not mad about..." — whatever it was. I can't even remember what it was now. And I was like, "Yeah, I guess you're right." And then [chuckles] I just started crying, and I was like, "I guess that — like I am just worried about going back." So I feel like it was like slowly starting to build. And then last night, too, like, [sniffles] I placed — we are doing birth announcements for Trae, and I placed the order and then realized I had ordered the wrong amount, and I was like, "Ah!" and getting all upset about that, and Todd's like, "You're not worried about birth announcements! Like, what are you worried about?" [00:31:11]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And that's when I kind of [pauses] got into to talking about it, too.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I feel like it is — I didn't want it to be like looming over me.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And that's another thing. Like, I woke up this morning and was [clucks] so tired because I didn't really sleep that well last night, just — I — I actually surprised myself 'cause, at first, I didn't think I'd be able to fall asleep 'cause Todd and I had <i>just</i> been talking about all of this before bed.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I did. Like, we were both pretty tired, so I did end up falling asleep, but then when I got up to feed him, I had trouble...
THERAPIST: ...Going back to sleep?
CLIENT: Falling back to sleep and — and so then when I did wake up in the morning, I felt so <i>tired</i>, and part of me was like a little annoyed 'cause I was like, you're wanting to like, you know, savor each of these days 'cause you're seeing him is like the last days of the summer, but now you've got yourself all tired in worrying about it [baby begins to fuss], and now you're up and...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Not really enjoying the morning; you're feeling tired. [Baby continues to fuss] You know, so I also feel like I don't want — because I'm feeling sad about going back... [00:32:05]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...Like, I don't want that to...
THERAPIST: ...Get in the way of enjoying it?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Like, that's kind of being counterproductive.
THERAPIST: [Puts a lot of pressure on the week] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think I just need to...
THERAPIST: Let it be what it is?
CLIENT: ...Let it go, yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, the week will be what the week is.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And it does not define what your summer with him was.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, what the last week of, you know, kind of, your leave was does not define the whole thing.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Letting this week be what this week is, [baby begins to fuss] letting the first week back to school be what the first week back to school is...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...It just — it is what it is...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And it doesn't mean anything or say anything about what — what your time was like, you know, during this special time, or who you are as a student or a mother; it just — I think it is what it is.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it will be whatever it looks like. And you have some [baby fusses] — you have some ability to shape it, but you don't have total ability. [00:33:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And if you're exhausted because you didn't sleep, [claps hand] then you're exhausted.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I mean, there are so many [baby fusses] [inaudible 33:08]...
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: ...Is a tired mom.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: And if, you know, you go back to school and you're a really tired student, then you're tired that day.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I know, I do — I feel like I just need to let it go, [baby fusses] like I need just built this week up too much in my head, I think.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And now here it is, and then I'm trying to live out this, like, perfect week.
THERAPIST: Like a script in advance.
CLIENT: A perfect — yeah — week that doesn't exist. You know, so...
THERAPIST: Well, I bet you can — [baby fusses] and whatever it is, I bet you can find some moments that are like...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And not...
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: ...Breaking it down a little bit so that it doesn't feel so, so big.
CLIENT: Right. And then knowing, too, that — I think having those Fridays and knowing, like, I'm keeping those [baby fusses, begins to cry] just for us, too...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:33:58]
CLIENT: ...Will be important. [Baby continues to fuss] And I've even been looking [baby begins to fuss more loudly] [inaudible at 34:03] some stuff like that, that happened Friday [baby fusses loudly] [inaudible at 34:06]....
THERAPIST: And I know lots of stuff happens on Friday because lots of people who do a four-day workweek take...
CLIENT: ...Take four days...
THERAPIST: ...Right, yeah, that they're — that they're around.
CLIENT: Yeah. So I think — I know, like — I feel like it will all work out. Like, I'm not — I don't feel like I have this sense of dread that this is the last week, 'cause everything is [baby fusses loudly] is going to be awful after this. I'm going to [inaudible at 34:26]...
[Baby fusses loudly making session inaudible]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: ...And you don't know what it is going to be. It is a 45-minute session. That's what you can do, Trae?
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Oh, my God, he's got more [of that] (ph) in mind. [Aside to baby] Huh?
THERAPIST: You have so many toys in there. Don't you want this?
[Baby responds, fusses]
CLIENT: [Aside to baby] Hmmm. [Baby begins to cry] [Pauses] Do you want to try and eat? [Baby fusses] [Whispers] Let's see — let's see if this will work, and then figure it out. [Baby fusses] [Chuckles] [00:35:01]
THERAPIST: Hi!
CLIENT: [Aside to baby] What do you think? Are you hungry or not? Or do we have another toy? [Sniffles] [Whispers] Let's see. [Fumbles with objects] I tried to pack a bunch of different things because I wasn't sure how easy it was going to be to occupy him. [Continues fumbling, possibly with bag] [Aside to baby] [Whispers] OK, and [sounds of rattle] this guy. [Pauses] Uh-oh, I left his favorite at home. This will be good. [Sighs] [00:36:08]
THERAPIST: You have your monkey?
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Whatever he can put in his mouth. [Aside to baby] [whispers] There. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: That works.
THERAPIST: That's just probably [filled at home] (ph)?
CLIENT: Yeah.
[Baby begins to fuss again]
CLIENT: [Aside to baby] Here. [Chuckles] [Sniffles] But I do feel like even this morning, I tried to...
[Baby begins to cry]
THERAPIST: Ahh...
CLIENT: Oh, should we try to [inaudible at 36:36]?
[Baby continues crying]
THERAPIST: That was — he thought you were going. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Ohhh. [Chuckles] [Aside to baby] [whispers] Here, let's bounce for one minute (ph). [Sniffles] [Sound of baby's rattle] And I feel like, even this morning, I'm trying to get him ready, and it was like to get here on time, I'm just trying to figure out...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...When do I feed him, and should I get here early and feed him or try and feed him at home?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I tried to feed him before we left, and he didn't want to cry [baby cries], and so I also was like [slaps surface] getting frustrated at home. And, again, I feel like that was me putting pressure on... [00:37:06]
THERAPIST: Pressure on - yeah.
CLIENT: ...The day — like, the day and thinking, "Oh, like, I didn't want it to be like a day that's frustrating; I want it to be a good day."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And so, again, like more pressures. I think that's all it is coming down to, is that I need to relax [baby begins to fuss] and not think. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: And — and take it in little chunks...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Because the day is not frustrating.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Getting out of the house this morning for the appointment was frustrating.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And letting yourself take the — letting — um, [clucks] letting yourself take things just for what they are...
CLIENT: Mm.
THERAPIST: ...And not projecting [baby shrieks/coos] it to cast a cloud over the rest.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And one of the things that helped you in the past was to think about doing a very neutral recording of what's going on.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: So you went [baby fusses] in your head, like, "Ach, this isn't the day that I wanted."
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And if you did a neutral recording, what would the headline be? "Getting out of the house was frustrating."
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And keeping it to just that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you have lots of other day to have. [00:38:02]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And there may be some [baby fusses] really nice moments in it, and there might be some more frustrating moments. But I think letting yourself report on what is exactly happening right now...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And keeping it just to that little piece.
CLIENT: Mm.
THERAPIST: So if you break it down into smaller chunks, it won't feel so ominous [baby begins to fuss again].
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It won't feel so hard to <i>manage</i>, 'cause you can manage — you can manage it, you know, a half-hour of frustration in trying to get your things...
CLIENT: Right, mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Or, you know, whatever happens next.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But if it is a little piece, it doesn't feel so — so much.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: Why don't we end there ['til Tuesday] (ph).
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: I think you're done.
CLIENT: [Sing-song] I'm done.
THERAPIST: Unless there's — I mean, if there's something else that you...
CLIENT: No, I feel like [chuckles] that's it. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: You're going to get split. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles] [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: Um, so let's [sound of object sliding] [When are you coming back] (ph)? Do we know...?
[Recording is turned off]
