<font size="4"><b>Anxiety, Heart Disease, and Mortality</b></font>

Although many experts consider anxiety to be a
universal feature of human existence, when it is
chronic and persistent it may have significant consequences
for both psychological and physical health. A
relationship between anxiety and heart disease has
been long noted by physicians. Coronary heart disease
(CHD) accounts for approximately 2.2 million hospitalizations
annually in the United States. The traditional
risk factors (e.g., smoking, hypertension)
explain only about 40% of the occurrence of CHD.
There is converging evidence that chronic anxiety, in
addition to causing emotional distress, strongly
affects heart health. In fact, some scientists have suggested
that anxiety may even influence longevity,
whereby more anxious people die sooner. If anxiety
indeed puts people at greater risk for heart disease or
premature mortality, it is critically important that society
invests in the identification and treatment of individuals
affected with anxiety. This could not only ease
a great deal of distress but also represent a potentially
important route to disease prevention.


THE NATURE OF ANXIETY


Anxiety is a strong negative emotion, accompanied
by a sense of unease, worry, and intrusive thoughts
that cannot be put to rest. Anxiety disorders are among
the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the United
States. Recent surveys estimate the prevalence of anxiety
in the general U.S. population ranging from
12.6% to 17.2%. Psychologists have suggested that

[p. <i>56</i>]

A characterization of anxiety can be informed by
an understanding of the nature of emotions more generally.
Theorists generally agree that specific emotions
arise out of the interaction between individuals
and their environments, and motivate individuals to
respond to external events (Frijda, 1986). For example,
if one is crossing a street and sees a car approaching
quickly, one might feel fear. The fear might
then motivate the individual to run out of the way.
Although emotions are generally adaptive processes,
they can have adverse consequences when the system
is taxed beyond the limits of its capability. For example,
when individuals are getting ready to take an
exam, they might feel anxious about their performance.
This anxiety can motivate them to prepare
appropriately for the exam. However, if they feel they
cannot ever be prepared or cannot cope with their anxiety,
the emotion may no longer be adaptive. In such
cases, the anxiety may itself become a problem. A
variety of theories have been proposed to explain the
development of anxiety and its disorders (Amir &amp;
Kozak, 1998).


Because the word <i>anxiety</i> represents both a lay
construct and a scientific term, precise definitions are
needed to facilitate research on the topic. Anxiety is a
future-oriented negative emotional state that results
from perceptions of threat. It is characterized by a
sense that one is unable to predict, control, or obtain
desired results in upcoming situations (Barlow, 1988).
Most people experience some level of anxiety at different
points in their lives. Anxiety may be considered
as a <i>state</i>, an episodic experience of the emotion
brought on by specific situations. Or it may be considered
as a <i>trait</i>, an enduring temperament, or predisposition
to experience the state of anxiety frequently.
Thus, someone who is characterized as "anxious"
may be a person who frequently experiences states of
anxiety in response to many different situations.


Because everyone experiences anxiety from time
to time, it is useful to distinguish normal from pathological
anxiety. Generally, when anxiety occurs
repeatedly at high levels, persists when real threats are
minimal, and interferes with routine functioning, it
may be considered a clinical or pathological manifestation.
A number of clinically defined disorders are
subsumed under the heading of anxiety disorders, for
example, panic disorder, social and simple phobias,
generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress
disorder. Psychological research has suggested that
pathological and normal anxiety reactions are essentially
similar, and differ not in terms of what it means
to feel anxious, but in the duration, intensity, and
timing of the experience.


STUDIES OF ANXIETY AND THE HEART


The body's physiological response mechanisms are
well adapted for dealing with short-term physical
emergencies such as running from danger. But anxiety
and other emotions may activate these same physiological
responses in the absence of actual danger. If
such responses are turned on frequently, or are not
shut off appropriately, they can become damaging.
Thus, anxiety may influence heart health directly
because it evokes physiological processes (e.g., excessive
release of hormones, increased speed of heart
rate), and indirectly because it influences health-related
behaviors.


Studies have examined the relationship between
anxiety and CHD or mortality in a number of different
ways. Causality between emotion and health may
go in both directions--chronic anxiety may set disease
processes in motion, but feeling sick may also
make people anxious. Moreover, if chronic anxiety is
going to influence health, it will be a function of
cumulative effects over time. It is not feasible to conduct
true experiments in which people can be assigned
to experience anxiety or not on an ongoing basis. As a
result, prospective studies are best suited for investigating
the risk of disease or death associated with
chronic anxiety. These studies measure anxiety among
initially disease-free individuals, and follow them
over time to see who develops heart disease or dies.
This allows investigators to be sure that illness is not
causing anxiety.


<b>Anxiety and Coronary Heart Disease</b>


<i>Development</i>


Most prospective epidemiological studies have
found an association between self-reported symptoms
of anxiety and risk of developing CHD. In one of the
earliest cohort studies, the Northwick Park Heart
Study, 1,457 initially healthy men were followed
for 10 years (Haines, Imeson, &amp; Meade, 1987).

[p. <i>57</i>]

A small number of studies have not found evidence
of anxiety as a risk factor for CHD, although generally
the design of these studies was not as strong as the
studies with positive findings (Kubzansky, Kawachi,
Weiss, &amp; Sparrow, 1998). Some investigators have
speculated that the apparent excess risk of CHD
among anxiety disorder patients may be due to a drug
effect, since many of these patients use psychotropic
medication. Little research has been done that directly
addresses this question. However, one study of fatal
heart attack in women examined the use of antianxiety
medication, and found that the excess risk of coronary
death was unlikely to be due to the effect of a drug.
Rather, this study found that the excess risk of CHD
death was related to the underlying condition that led
to the original prescription of psychotropic drugs,
rather than to the drugs themselves (Thorogood,
Cowen, Mann, Murphy, &amp; Vessey, 1992). The possibility
that subclinical heart disease may lead to the
subjective experience of anxiety cannot be excluded.
However, no data presently exist demonstrating a relationship
between subclinical CHD and anxiety. In the
absence of symptoms, it is difficult to argue that
knowledge of potential disease status, or physical discomfort
associated with subclinical disease, caused
anxiety. In fact, it has been found that individuals
reporting symptoms of CHD often have normal or near
normal arteries, suggesting that these individuals have
primary psychiatric rather than cardiac disorders.


<i>Prognosis</i>


Although researchers have more often studied
effects of depression rather than anxiety in coronary
patients, a number of studies have found that anxiety
is also very common among individuals with established
heart disease. Approximately 50% of patients
in the coronary care unit exhibit very high levels of
anxiety. Unfortunately, in the vast majority of these
patients, the anxiety is neither diagnosed nor treated.
Studies have suggested that the increased risk of further
complications in highly anxious patients with
heart disease may range from 2.5- to 5-fold (Moser &amp;
Dracup, 1996). As yet, the mechanisms for these
effects are not well understood. However, given that
anxiety activates a variety of physiological and behavioral
responses known to influence heart health, it
may affect not only the development of CHD but also
outcomes following acute coronary events.


<b>Anxiety and Mortality</b>


Researchers have also studied the association
between anxiety and mortality. The majority of published
studies have found that there is indeed a relationship
between anxiety and mortality--generally,
these studies have been methodologically stronger
than those that did not find such a relationship. In
many of these studies, the cause of death was related to
CHD. For example, studies of psychiatric patients have
suggested a link between anxiety disorders and premature
death from CHD. However, a number of studies
have also suggested that anxiety is associated with
other causes of death. For example, two recent studies
found that among breast cancer patients, those with
higher levels of anxiety did not survive as long (Gibrar,
1996; Weihs, Enright, Simmens, &amp; Reiss, 2000). Other
studies have found increased risk of premature mortality
from all causes of death for highly anxious individuals
relative to those who are less anxious. Some of
this work has found that men (but not women) with
anxiety disorders are at increased risk for premature
mortality. However, a systematic comparison of risk
for men and women has not yet been done.


<i>Potential Mechanisms: Physical Effects of Anxiety</i>


Several mechanisms have been proposed by which
chronic anxiety may result in damage to the heart and
subsequent increased risk of CHD. Anxiety muy affect

[p. <i>58</i>]

Chronic anxiety may also cause damage to the
heart more directly by repeatedly activating the sympathetic
nervous system, causing excess release of
hormones, and suppressing immune function
(Schneiderman, 1987). This may lead to a cascade of
effects beginning with physical and chemical changes
in the blood and blood flow that ultimately damage
the heart. For example, the recurring release of certain
hormones may cause a buildup of fatty deposits in the
coronary arteries. This can lead to atherosclerosis--damage
in the coronary arteries resulting in narrowing
and eventual impairment of blood flow. One recent
study found that atherosclerosis developed at a faster
rate among individuals reporting high versus low levels
of anxiety (Paterniti, Zureik, Ducimetiere, Feve, &amp;
Alperovitch, 2001).


Anxiety may also influence the electrical stability
of the heart in a variety of ways. Recurrent anxiety
may disrupt the balance between the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems that together regulate
cardiac rhythm. Heart rate variability (HRV) provides
a noninvasive measure of this balance. A variety
of studies provide converging evidence of an association
between anxiety and altered HRV. In some studies,
decreased HRV has been associated with social
inhibition in children, itself a developmental precursor
of panic and other anxiety disorders. Multiple studies
have also revealed an association between anxiety and
altered HRV among adults. Taken together, these findings
suggest that abnormal regulation of cardiac
rhythm, as measured by reduced HRV, may be an
important mechanism linking anxiety and CHD, especially
sudden cardiac death.


Anxiety may also place people at greater risk for
CHD by leading to alterations in blood pressure and
heart rate. Generally, the research suggests that a stable
anxious disposition is related to an increased risk
of high blood pressure (hypertension). Studies in
psychiatric and nonclinical settings largely support
the notion that highly anxious individuals are more
likely to develop hypertension. For example, one
study of 468 middle-aged normotensive women found
that those with more anxiety had greater increases in
systolic blood pressure over a 3-year period
(Markovitz, Matthews, Wing, Kuller, &amp; Meilahn,
1991). Effects of anxiety on blood pressure may be
even greater than research has found to date. Some
investigators have found that there is a subset of anxious
individuals who repress their anxiety, and as a
result are not identified as being anxious by the usual
measures. However, research designed to identify
these people has often found that repressed anxiety is
also associated with increased risk for hypertension.


<i>Acute Anxiety and Triggering of CHD</i>


There is some evidence that anxiety might have
immediate effects and actually trigger a heart attack.
Triggering mechanisms may differ from those that
incur long-term damage. For example, the sharp
hemodynamic changes associated with acute anxiety
states may precipitate plaque rupture in predisposed
coronary vessels. For example, one study found that
risk for heart attack was approximately 1.5 times
increased when an anxiety episode occurred in the 2
hours preceding the event (Mittleman et al., 1995).
Thus, anxiety may influence CHD and mortality via
both chronic and acute effects.
