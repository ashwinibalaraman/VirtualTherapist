<font size="4"><b>18: Parenting Children with Mental Health Problems</b></font>

<b>SUMMARY</b>


The parenting of children who are experiencing problems in development is a major
challenge. In this chapter we focus on the specific difficulties of parenting children
with emotional and behavioral disturbance. They are children who, for instance, suffer
from unusual levels of anxiety when approaching new situations. They may frequently
worry, be afraid of sleeping alone, or in more extreme cases, avoid challenging situations
such as school. The anxiety they experience makes it difficult for them to cope
with everyday tasks. Other children may feel unhappy and tearful much of the time,
such that it is not easy for them to function in their everyday lives.


How can parents help children who are struggling with these kinds of difficulties?
We consider recent research findings on the etiology of children's mental health disorders
to help us understand the key role that parents and other people who are close to
children play in exacerbating or ameliorating these problems. We also consider the
research evidence on the types of treatments that are effective for children with emotional
and behavioral difficulties. We then build on such treatment evidence to suggest
ways that parents can help their children who are suffering from such disturbance.


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>


Mental health difficulties in children fall into two
broad categories of internalizing and externalizing
disturbance. Internalizing disorders involve disturbances
of affect; they include emotional disorders
(feelings of sadness, depression, guilt, and dysphoria),
anxiety (feelings of fearfulness, worry, or nervousness),
and separation anxiety (clinging,
dependent, and distressed behavior upon separation
from parents). In contrast, externalizing disorders
typically involve negative behaviors that are
problematic for the child and disturbing to others.
They include conduct disorders (threatening or
physically attacking people, and cruelty), physical
aggression (getting into many fights, hitting,
kicking, biting), and hyperactivity (fidgety and
impulsive behavior). Parenting children with externalizing
problems is die focus of chapter 19 and
will not therefore be covered in this chapter.


Our discussion of effective treatments and the
role of parents will focus mainly on parenting
children with internalizing disturbances, such as
anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression are
the most common types of internalizing disorders.
They often co-occur and their symptoms may intensify
as children become adolescents (Strauss et al.,
1988; Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000). The mental health
problems that children can show during the
preschool period are is more difruse than in later
years, and there is considerable overlap in internalizing
and externalizing difficulties (Richman et al.,
1982).

<b>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</b>


Clinical theories and research findings have been
influential in shaping the views of developmentalists
on the role of parenting in children's
emotional and behavioral problems. Crossfertilization
has occurred between the clinical
and research domains over time such that
research on parenting has affected clinical practice.
In turn, researchers have been intrigued by
the richness of clinical theories and have subsequently
used them to inform the hypotheses to be
tested in their research studies (Vuchinich et al.,
1988; Patterson et al., 1993). This interplay
between clinical work and research has been
essential for developing the understanding that
most parenting researchers and clinicians now
share. The consensus view that now informs both
clinicians and researchers is characterized by two
main elements, which maintain that children's
mental health difficulties are influenced by
multiple factors and that these are reciprocal and
bi-directional influences (Collins et al., 2000).


First, mental health problems in children are
multi-determined. Children contribute constitutional
and genetic vulnerabilities (Rutter et al.,
1999), as well as sequenced experiences that
make them more vulnerable to the development
of mental health disorders (Rutter, 1996). Factors
outside children, such as different aspects of their
context, also influence their development.
Although the family context has been a focus of
interest for both clinicians and researchers for six
decades, schools (Mortimore, 1998), neighborhoods
(Sampson et al., 1997), and peer groups
(Hogue and Steinberg, 1996), have recently been
identified as central factors influencing the
development of emotional and behavioral problems
in children.


Second, although much research work involves
the presentation of linear relationships and unidirectional
influences, most clinicians and
researchers operate from a bi-directional model
that emphasizes reciprocal parent-child influences
on the development of child disturbance. Until
recently the statistics and research methods that
allow for the investigation of more dynamic models
have not been available or within the competence
of non-statisticians. Developments, both
theoretical (Kenny, 1994) and statistical (growth
curve modeling, structural equation modeling)
(Snijders and Kenny, 1999; Boyle and Wilhns,
2001), have meant that it is now possible to test
models that have bi-directional processes at their
core (Conger and Conger, 1994).


Before describing such a model we consider
some of the clinical perspectives informing
treatment of children between the 1930s and
1960s. Reflected in these early perspectives is a
continuum, where at one end, parents have no
role in children's disturbance, and at the other
end, parents and the more general care-giving
context have a <i>significant</i> role in children's disturbance.
Today most people would operate in
the middle of this continuum, where both child
and parent effects are seen as important factors in
children's mental health. Tensions continue to
exist, however, around the extent of child and
parent contributions to child well-being.


The earliest psychotherapeutic treatments for
child disturbance occurred within a psychoanalytic
framework. Initially, parents were not seen
to play an important role in either why children
became disturbed or how to help them once such
disturbance developed. Freud (1916/17) hypothesized
that children's anxiety resulted from the
existence of their unconscious infantile aggressive
or libidinous wishes about their parents.
Melanie Klein's early formulation of childhood
disturbance involved the mechanism of splitting.
Splitting occurred when the infant had an intense
need that was not immediately met. The intensity
of the child's own affect led to splitting, and the
external world (that is, the parents) was thought
to have very little role in this.


This view of the parental role, however,
changed with Winnicott (1960), one of the
founders of object relations theory. He was
influential in directing attention from the
intrapsychic experience of the baby to the quality
of the care-giving environment. He argued
that mothers (they were seen as much more
central to the emotional well-being of the developing
child than fathers, siblings or extended
family) could influence the affective or intrapsychic
experience of their babies by the ways in
which they interacted with them. Through 'good
enough mothering' mothers could moderate
their babies' experience of challenging environments.
Although there would be challenges from
the external world when infants would be frustrated
and unhappy, mothers could provide a
source of comfort that would affect how these
experiences were stored in memory to affect
subsequent experience. This is effectively a
moderation model, an issue that we return to in
a later section.


Attachment theory, which is essentially a
modern extension of object relations theory, differs
from that theory in articulating a more
central role for primary care-givers in the etiology
of children's disturbance (Ainsworth et al.,
1978). Attachment researchers have argued that
parenting in the first year of life influences
children's attachment security, which is related

What is the legacy of psychoanalytic thinking
that affects how we understand the role of parents
in children's mental health today? There are
several elements to emphasize. Infants and
young children are thought to compile emotional
experience into mental models that affect their
responses to later events (Baldwin, 1992; Stern,
1994). These mental models reflect parent-child
interactional history, but they also reflect the
intrapsychic and meaning-making processes
(such as attributional processes) that are idiosyncratic
to that particular child. These ideas have
generated empirical studies of the ways in which
early attachment status influences the development
of~ mental health difficulties such as anxiety
and depression (Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000), the
quality of later intimate relationships (Owens
et al., 1995), and one's capacity to parent (Fonagy
et al., 1991).


The psychoanalytic framework has had a profound
impact on practice. Much of the work in
children's mental health centers today has the
child's mental models as a focus of treatment
(psychoanalytic and cognitive) as well as the
mother-child relationship. The less beneficial
aspect of this impact is that bi-directional influences
are often minimized such that child effects
in the development of the attachment relationship
are minimized (Goldsmith and Alansky,
1997). Another drawback is that this has led to a
treatment and research focus on the mother-child
dyad, with other aspects of the family and
broader social systems being neglected.


Another clinical model that was influential
both historically and presently in how practitioners
think about the role of parents in children's
mental health is the behavioral model. This
model is based on principles of learning theory.
Parents are seen to have an important role in the
etiology and treatment of problem behavior
(Patterson, 1971). If a child engages in problematic
behavior it is thought that behavior is more
or less likely to be repeated, based on how people
in the environment have responded to it. From
the vantage point of operant conditioning, the
parental role in behavior disturbance is that parents
inadvertently encourage problematic behaviors
or emotions by rewarding them. Thus
the anxious behavior of a three-year-old child,
displayed when the parents leave to go out for the
evening, is reinforced when the parents abandon
their plans and stay home. In such a case the
parents are involved in therapy in order to modify
their own behavior to change environmental contingencies
that are reinforcing specific behavior
patterns.


It is also possible that the elements of a child's
context relevant to the problem may not involve
the parents. The rewards for the problematic
behavior may come from the child, peers, teachers,
and others. In this case the parental role involves
observation of children's behavior to identify
environmental contingencies. The behavioral
framework has been very useful in our understanding
of the role of parents in children's mental
health problems by emphasizing the need to
view behavior as intrinsically linked to the context
in which it occurs. The careful analysis of
the function of behavior means that contingencies
to behavior are carefully analyzed and
parents are not automatically assumed to be
implicated in children's emotional and behavioral
problems. Other contextual influences may
prove to be more important.


<b><i>Contemporary Understanding of the
Relationship between Parenting and
Children's Mental Health</i></b>


Currently, many practitioners and family
researchers have integrated concepts from
psychoanalytic thinking and behavioral models
to conceptualize development within a systemic
framework. Mental health problems in children
are seen as part of a dynamic process, involving
many different components of a complex system.
Most practitioners believe that aspects of children
that are intrinsic to them influence how their
family treats them, but at the same time they
would maintain that behavior of parents and
siblings directed towards the child, has a further
influence on future behaviors and emotional
states of the child. Most practitioners would also
agree that family members are influenced by forces
outside the family. Schools and neighborhoods
contribute to how children develop, but they also
influence how supported parents feel, and how
easy it is for them to parent.


Although most practitioners will agree on such
a systemic view of the etiology of disturbance in
children, many focus on one element of this
system when trying to help the child and family.
This is because changing one element of the
system has been shown to result in unproved
outcomes for other aspects of the system (Kazdin
and Wassell, 2000). Thus effective therapeutic

<b>CORE ISSUES</b>


As stated earlier, the main focus of this chapter is
on parenting children with internalizing disturbances,
such as anxiety or depression. The types,
incidence rates, and variants will be reviewed
first for anxiety disorders and second for depression
or dysthymia.


<b><i>Anxiety Disorders</i></b>


Anxiety disorders are one of the most common
types of disorders experienced by children and
adolescents; they are often associated with problems
in other areas of functioning (i.e. school),
and other psychiatric difficulties such as dysthymia
and depression (Albana et al., 1996;
Kendall et al., 2000; Vasey and Dadds, 2001).
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), which is
the classification system used to make diagnoses
in North America, identifies three main subtypes
of anxiety disorders, including separation anxiety
disorder (SAD), social phobia (SP), and generalized
anxiety disorder (GAD) (American
Psychiatric Association, 1994).


Separation anxiety disorder is the only one of
these three subtypes that can be diagnosed in
children and not in adults. SAD is characterized
by feelings of extreme anxiety, fear, panic, and
concerns about danger or death, and these feelings
occur when a child is separated or about to
be separated from his/her attachment figure.
Such feelings may prevent separation from the
attachment figure or limit a child's activity
(Kendall et al., 2000). Social phobia is characterized
by a child's avoidance or withdrawal from
new situations or unfamiliar people (Kendall
et al., 2000), and generalized anxiety disorder is
characterized by pervasive worries about
performance, relationships, and health (Kendall
et al., 2000). Otiier types of anxiety disorders
found in the DSM-IV include obsessive compulsive
disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobias
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994).


The incidence rates of anxiety disorders and
their subtypes vary according to a number of
factors, including sample (community versus
clinic), type of disorder, respondent (child versus
parent), age, and gender. Weiss and Last (2001)
recently summarized a body of evidence to estimate
these incidence rates. In community samples,
rates of childhood anxiety disorders range
from approximately 10 to 20 per cent (Kashani
and Orvaschel, 1988; McGee et al., 1990; Weiss
and Last, 2001). The rates are much higher in
clinical samples and range from approximately
27 to 45 per cent (Last et al., 1992; Weiss and
Last, 2001). The prevalence rate for SAD ranges
from 2 to 12 per cent; for SP the prevalence rate
is approximately 1 per cent; and for GAD, the
prevalence rate ranges from 2 to 5 per cent
among adolescents. Children report more anxious
symptoms than their parents do. These incidence
rates are reduced, however, when
functional impairment is required for a diagnosis
(Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000).


Specific types of anxiety disorders also appear
to vary according to children's age and gender.
SAD is more common in early and middle childhood,
while panic disorders, and GAD are more
common in older children and adolescents.
Animal phobias are more common in early childhood
while social phobias are more common in
adolescence (Marks and Gelder, 1966; Zahn-Waxler
et al., 2000). In terms of gender differences,
rates of anxiety disorder in non-referred
samples are higher for girls than for boys
(Costello, 1989; Kashani and Orvaschel, 1990;
Weiss and Last, 2001). Gender differences
should be interpreted with caution, however,
given that cultural variations may lead to
increased awareness and referral rates of anxiety
disorders in girls rather than boys (Kendall et al.,
2000). The form of anxiety experienced by
children may also change with age, although the
level of anxiety remains consistent (Weiss and
Last, 2001). For example, preschool difficulties
such as shyness and behavioral inhibition predict
later childhood anxiety disorders (Dadds and
Roth, 2001), while child and adolescent anxiety
disorders predict impairment in adulthood and
adult anxiety disorders (Ollendick and King,
1994; Vasey and Dadds, 2001). In a longitudinal
study of clinically referred children, only 18 per
cent of children met the criteria for their original
diagnosis 3-4 years later (Last et al., 1996).

<b><i>Depressive Disorders</i></b>


Major depressive disorder (MDD) and its milder
version dysthymic disorder (DD) are the most
common types of depressive disorders in children
and adolescents (Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000).
MDD and DD occur less often than anxiety disorders
and more often than manic-depressive disorder
(MD) (Zahn-Waxler et al, 2000). Major
depressive disorder involves a period of time that
is characterized by depressed mood, feelings of
sadness, irritability, anhedonia, fatigue, suicidal
ideation, and difficulty concentrating (American
Psychiatric Association, 1994). Dysthymic disorder
is less severe than MDD and is characterized
by a chronically depressed mood, irritability, low
energy, and poor concentration (American
Psychiatric Association, 1994). Dysthymia
occurs more frequently than depression, lasts
longer than depression (3 years versus 8-9
months), is more resistant to treatment than
depression, and likely has a more negative impact
on later psychosocial adjustment than depression
(Kovacs et al, 1984; McCauley et al., 1993;
Harrington et al., 1996; Stark et al., 2000).
Depressive episodes are recurrent, suggesting that
depressed children will likely experience further
depressive episodes (Stark et al., 2000).


Akin to anxiety disorders, the incidence of
depressive disorders also varies according to age
and gender (Stark et al., 2000). Depression occurs
rarely in preschool, and in approximately 2 per
cent of school-age children and pre-adolescents.
There is a marked increase in depressive symptoms
associated with age through to the end of
adolescence where depression reaches adult levels
of 15-20 per cent (Rutter et al., 1970; McGee
et al., 1990; Lewinsohn et al., 1994; Stark et al.,
2000). For dysthymic disorder, the rate in childhood
ranges from 0.6 to 2.5 per cent, and the rate
in adolescence ranges from 3 to 8 per cent.
Research on the prevalence rates for depression
and dysthymia is somewhat limited because the
disorders are sometimes assessed separately and
sometimes assessed in combination (Stark et al,
2000). The rate of depression is significantly
higher in clinic samples (42 per cent) and in
children who have additional medical or academic
difficulties (Peterson et al., 1993; Stark
et al., 2000).


The specific symptoms or precursors of
depression experienced by children also vary
with age. Prepubertal children tend to experience
more separation anxiety, phobias, somatic
complaints and psychomotor agitation, while
adolescents experience more hypersomnia, hopelessness,
and anhedonia (Ryan et al., 1987;
Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000). In terms of gender
differences, the prevalence rates for boys and
girls are similar until early adolescence, at which
point females experience depression more often
than males and for longer periods of time (Stark
et al., 2000).


The prevalence and expression of internalizing
disorders also appear to vary according to
culture, although the scarcity of research in this
area makes it difficult to draw conclusions
(Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000). Cultural norms that
guide the expression of emotion and patterns of
coping with stress likely influence the type of
mental health difficulties that develop and the
prevalence rate of such difficulties in different
cultures (Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000). One finding
that does appear to generalize across
cultures is that girls are more likely than boys to
have internalizing disorders (Crijnen et al.,
1997).


In summary, research to date indicates that a
substantial proportion of children and adolescents
suffer from internalizing disorders. Anxiety and
depression frequently co-occur and the comorbidity
rate has been estimated to fall between
20 and 50 per cent (Brady and Kendall, 1992;
Angold et al., 1999; Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000).
Internalizing disorders are also co-morbid with
externalizing disorders. This co-morbidity
amongst anxiety, depression, and externalizing
disorders and the cyclical nature of depression
highlight the challenge that parents face when
parenting children with mental health difficulties.


<b>PRACTICE OF PARENTING</b>


We now consider the role of parents in the genesis,
continuation, and amelioration of mental
health difficulties and internalizing disorders.
With regard to the role of parents in the genesis
and continuation of child internalizing disorders,
three potential sources of influence are discussed:
independent parent and child effects; joint or
bi-directional parent and child effects; and
moderation effects, which involve potential risk
factors that operate in conjunction with other
factors to contribute to the development of
mental health difficulties. Finally, we briefly
review research examining the effectiveness of
involving parents in treatment aimed at reducing
child internalizing disorders.

<i><b>Child and Parent Effects in
Children's Mental Health Problems</b></i>


It has long been recognized that children with
mental health problems have more problematic
relationships with their parents. Many different
aspects of problematic parenting have been
found to be associated with increased mental
health problems in children. For instance, when
parents are more critical towards their children
and less supportive (Pettit and Bates, 1989;
Hibbs et al., 1992; Ge et al., 1996; Pettit et al.,
1997), when they expose the children to violence
(Sternberg et al., 1993), and when they show less
sensitivity and emotional involvement (Garber
et al., 1995), their children show more difficulties
with anxiety and depression, and other mental
health problems. Evidence to date suggests that
family stress and problematic parenting are
unlikely to predict uniquely to specific disorders
(Williams et al., 1990). Instead, they are more
likely to provide a general stress for the child,
which in interaction with individual characteristics
of children, such as temperament, age, gender
and other factors, results in an internalizing
or externalizing disorder. We first review evidence
demonstrating that the quality of the
parent-child relationship is influenced both by
parents and by children, and then we go on to
consider genetic effects in children's mental
health problems.


One of the important shifts that has taken
place in people's thinking about parenting and
mental health problems in children is the extent
of the child's contribution to the quality of the
relationship that grows up between parent and
child. Although the idea that children influence
their parents has been present in the clinical and
research literature for a long time (Bell and
Harper, 1977), the ways that such effects are differentiated
from parent effects or from other contextual
effects has become more sophisticated
and convincing. Consider an example. Typically,
when behavioral geneticists do twin studies they
examine the similarities between twins, who
differ on their degree of genetic relatedness, on
outcomes such as personality, psychiatric
disturbance, levels of achievement and so on.
An innovative twist to these studies involves
the examination of the parent-child relationship
as the outcome. A study by Rowe and Plomin
(1981) compared the parenting received by
monozygotic twins (who share 100 per cent of
their genes) with that received by dizygotic
twins (who share 50 per cent of their genes).
Monozygotic twins have been found to be more
similar in their behavior and temperaments than
dizygotic twins. If parents were not influenced
in their parenting by characteristics of their
babies then we would expect monozygotic and
dizygotic twins to be parented similarly. In fact,
monozygotic twins were parented much more
similarly than dizygotic twins. This suggests
that characteristics of babies elicit different
responses from parents.


The 'child effect' that has received the most
attention is an aspect of temperament that has
been called behavioral inhibition or shyness.
Behaviorally inhibited children show high levels
of fear to novelty. They attempt to avoid whatever
it is that is threatening to them. Children
who are temperamentally shy as toddlers or
young children are more at risk of developing
anxiety and depression later in their lives (Rubin,
1993) and of showing patterns of social avoidance
as adults (Caspi et al., 1988; Gest, 1997).
Behavioral inhibition has been found to show at
least some degree of heritability. Emde et al.
(1992) examined 200 pairs of 14-month-old
twins, half monozygotic and half dizygotic.
Different aspects of emotionality and temperament
were assessed by parental report and independent
observation. The evidence for genetic
influence was stronger for shyness (also called
behavioral inhibition) than for any other temperamental
construct as genetic influence was
evident both for observational measures and
parental report measures, a pattern not seen for
other measures.


Behaviorally inhibited children have been
found to elicit particular patterns of behavior
from their parents and thus to play their part in
shaping the relationship. Behaviorally inhibited
children elicit more comforting as well as more
intrusiveness from mothers in the form of
encouragement to approach novel stimuli
(Nachmias et al., 1996). It may be that parental
behaviors such as intrusiveness, particularly in
highly fearful children, may operate against the
development of successful coping strategies in
the face of novelty, on the part of the child.


As well as genetic effects being evident for
behavioral inhibition as an aspect of temperament
that may predispose to anxiety disorders,
genetic influences are also evident for anxiety
and depressive disorders in children. Heritability
estimates for depression and anxiety vary
markedly depending on the study design and
study informants (Rutter et al., 1999). A study by
Thapar and McGuffin (1995) examined twin
pairs between 8 and 16 years of age and had parents
and children report on children's anxiety. A
significant genetic component was found, based
on parental ratings, but no significant genetic
component was found that was based on adolescent
ratings. The largest twin study, including

[p. <i>302</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00320&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As well as characteristics of children influencing
the quality of the relationship that grows up
between parents and their children, characteristics
of parents also contribute to the formation of
these relationships and in turn relate to mental
health problems in children. Parents' histories of
being parented have been found to be related to
their abilities to care for their children. For
instance, work by Quinton and Rutter (1988) has
found that women who had been raised in institutions
and looked after by multiple care-givers
were less effective with their own children than
women who had been raised with their own
mothers. Attachment researchers have shown
that there are striking similarities in the relational
style that mothers have with their own mothers
and that mothers have with their babies (Benoit
and Parker, 1994). Personality characteristics
have also been found to affect parenting. For
instance, Clark et al. (2000) found that maternal
neuroticism and extraversion, assessed when
children were 8-10 months old, were both positively
related to power assertive parenting when
infants were between 13 and 15 months of age.
Even more interesting from the standpoint of
child and parent effects is the observation that
parenting at 13-15 months was predicted by a
combination of child and parent personality
effects. Maternal personality was differentially
related to later parenting, depending on the temperament
of the baby being parented.


<b><i>Bi-directional Influences</i></b>


Many of the studies linking mental health problems
in children with the quality of parenting that they
receive are carried out cross-sectionally rather
than longitudinally. When children's behavior
and parental behavior is assessed at the same
point in time it is not possible to untangle
whether problematic parenting has caused
anxious or depressed child behavior, whether
difficult children have elicited problematic
responses from their parents, or whether these
two variables are linked only because of their
relationship to a third variable. Two kinds of
research designs have enabled researchers to get
a clearer picture of how these associations come
about. One design involves the collection of longitudinal
data, with child behavior and parenting
behaviors assessed at two or more time points. It
is then possible to examine whether a change in
child behavior is predicted by earlier parenting or
whether a change in parenting behavior is predicted
by earlier child behavior. When such
mutual influence models have been tested there
is evidence that effects between parents and
children go in both directions (Conger and
Conger, 1994).


The second design involves sequential analysis
of observations (Gottman, 1980; Patterson, 1982).
In this type of study, sequences of interaction are
coded, allowing one to see how person A's behavior
elicits B's response, which in turn elicits A's
subsequent behavior. Although such sequences
can still be influenced by genetic effects, the main
mechanism involved in such patterns is assumed
to be based on social learning theory. These problematic
sequences have been found to revolve
around emotion expressions and responses. In
experimental tasks, anger expressions are more
likely to elicit anger and aggression than sadness
and fear. Sadness and fear expressions are most
likely to elicit comforting behaviors and concern
(Biglan et al., 1985, 1989; Jenkins and Ball,
2000). It may be that internalizing emotions such
as depression and anxiety function to suppress
aggression and elicit increased care. Examinations
of the interactions of depressed mothers, their
children and their husbands have found that mothers'
depressed moods resulted in the suppression of
fathers' and children's aggression (Hops et al.,
1987). These moods functioned to win respite
from the anger of otiier family members. When
the fathers and children did express anger to the
mothers, this temporarily suppressed her distressed
mood. Dadds et al. (1996) studied the
family interaction sequences of anxious children,
who were compared to aggressive and non-clinic
children during a problem-solving task that asked
families to solve anxiety-provoking interpersonal
situations. During this task, parents of anxious
children were more likely than the other parents to
respond by offering encouragement to children's
avoidant solutions and by offering fewer prosocial
solutions. Such responses led anxious
children to adopt avoidant solutions as their final
solutions.


As well as contextual effects in families playing
a role in the maintenance of children's symptoms,

<b><i>Moderation Effects</i></b>


There is a third important role that parents may
play in children's mental health. It arises from
the fact that factors that put children at risk may
operate contingently. The same factor can have
quite different effects when it occurs in two different
circumstances, such that the effects of one
factor modify the effects of another factor. This
is important for understanding the relationship
between parenting and children's mental health
for several reasons.


Parenting styles have been found to be differently
associated with outcomes in children
depending on the temperament of the children.
Consider, for instance, the internalization of
values in children. Kochanska (1997) examined
children's temperament and maternal socialization
when children were 2-3 years old and
children's consciences when they were 4 years
old, and showed that for children who were fearful
as toddlers, conscience was best promoted by
gentle maternal discipline. For children fearless as
toddlers, secure attachment and maternal responsiveness
promoted conscience development. The
observation that temperamental differences in
children necessitate different parental treatment
for optimal child development has also been borne
out with respect to externalizing outcomes in
children. Bates et al. (1998), for example, found
that children with different degrees of resistance
to control needed different parenting for optimal
outcomes. Children who were very resistant in
infancy showed less externalizing behavior at
7 years old if their mothers were low on restrictive
parenting than if they were high on restriction.
Children who were low resistant in infancy
showed less externalizing behavior if mothers
were more restrictive during their infancy.


Not all children exposed to environmental
risks develop mental health problems. There are
characteristics of children, or characteristics of
their environment, that help them to withstand the
stress. This area of research is known as the study
of protective factors and is based on the premise
that risk factors operate contingently - negatively
affecting some children but not those who are
'protected.' Factors that have been found to be
protective for children include children's social
relationships, their IQs, and as we have seen
above, their temperaments (Jenkins and Smith,
1990; Werner, 1993; Masten et al., 1999; Luthar
et al., 2000). The reason that such findings are
important in thinking about the role of parents in
children's mental health is that elements of
children's lives combine together in complex
ways. Although we have been able to identify
certain common risk factors in children's lives
related to family and peer relationships, biological
and genetic factors within individuals, schools
and communities, as well as positive elements in
their lives that may help them to withstand adversity,
too many questions remain about the ways in
which such elements combine for us to be able to
be accurate in our predictions of who will
develop mental health problems.


With specific regard to the development of
internalizing problems, Rapee (1997) reviewed
the literature on the potential role of childrearing
practices in anxiety and depression. It is
difficult to draw conclusions from this area of
work because there are too few studies that have
originated from varied theoretical perspectives
and have used multiple methods. More research
is required to distinguish between the roles that
general parent psychopathology and specific
parenting behaviors play in the development of
anxiety and depression. Initial evidence suggested
that rejecting parenting behavior was
associated with child depression while controlling
parenting behavior was related to child
anxiety (Rapee, 1997). More research is also
required to examine the bi-directional effects of
child temperament, parent personality, and
parenting behaviors in the development of internalizing
disorders.


<b><i>Role of Parenting in the Amelioration
of Internalizing Symptoms</i></b>


Although there is some research examining
parent and child effects as sources of influence in
the development of children's mental health
problems, there is comparatively little research
examining the role of parental involvement in
treatment outcomes, particularly for internalizing
disorders (Kendall et al., 2000). Thus far,
treatment research in child and adolescent psychotherapy
has focused on the effectiveness of
specific treatment techniques and not the potential
contributions of other factors, such as child,
parent, and family involvement (Kazdin, 1997).

[p. <i>304</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00322&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Given that 40-60 per cent of children and adolescents
drop out of treatment before its completion
and that those who drop out have more
severe difficulties than those who remain, it is
important to solicit and encourage parents' ongoing
involvement in their children's treatment
programs (Wierzbicki and Pekarik, 1993;
Armbruster and Kazdin, 1994; Kazdin, 1997).
Retention in treatment programs may be
achieved by reducing parental stress. This may
occur if parents have an opportunity to discuss
their own concerns (Prinz and Miller, 1994), if
they receive financial support for covering the
cost of attending treatment, if childcare services
are provided for their children who are not in
treatment, and if the therapist forges a strong
alliance with all family members, including the
parent (Kazdin, 1997). Success early in treatment
is a predictor of early discontinuation (Kazdin,
1997), suggesting that it is important to emphasize
the role that ongoing treatment is likely to
play in children and adolescents' ability to sustain
the gains that they make early in the treatment
process.


Consistent with a systemic view of the etiology
and treatment of children's mental health difficulties,
it is important to investigate the potential
sources of the disorder. Problems within the family
context, maternal stress or depression, insecure
attachments, and behavioral inhibition or
shyness are all factors that may put children at
risk for the development of either anxious or
depressive disorders (Duggal et al., 2001;
Manassis, 2001; Vasey and Dadds, 2001).
Knowledge about the potential sources of child
and adolescent anxiety or depression has treatment
implications in that it can guide decisions about
the nature and course of treatment. Most clinicians
thoroughly investigate children's developmental
histories when completing a mental
health assessment. During this process, it would
be useful to consider the specific role that etiological
factors have played in the development of
children's internalizing difficulties. For example,
when working with a child who has an anxiety
disorder, one might look for signs of early attachment
difficulties, behavioral inhibition, or shyness
(Manassis, 2001).


Evidence suggests that differential parenting
styles, insecure attachment patterns, and temperamental
vulnerabilities (for example, shyness
or behavioral inhibition) interact to contribute to
the development of sub-clinical and clinical anxiety
disorders. Longitudinal research by Warren
et al. (1997) has found that adolescents who had
shown anxious-resistant attachment patterns at
one year of age were twice as likely to have an
anxiety disorder in adolescence than nonanxiously
attached infants. Moreover, anxiousresistant
attachment patterns in infancy were
stronger predictors of adolescent anxiety disorder
than were measures of maternal anxiety or child
temperament (Warren et al., 1997). Insecure
infant attachment relationships may be one mechanism
dirough which childhood anxiety disorders
are developed and maintained (Manassis, 2001).


It may be useful for clinicians working with
children and their families to explore clients'
attachment histories. Clinicians may also ask
parents about their children's temperament, how
they have coped or responded to their child's
temperament, and how the parents themselves
cope with anxiety. Parents whose children are
securely attached to them, for instance, will
likely be able to participate in their child's treatment
by being empathie toward their child and
helping them to face desensitization procedures
designed to help their children overcome anxiety
(Manassis, 2001). If a secure attachment relationship
does not exist between a client and
his/her parents, then this information is useful in
that the clinician could act as a secure attachment
figure for a child or adolescent who is attempting
to cope with anxiety. Further, if an anxious child
or adolescent has a disorganized attachment that
has resulted from unresolved loss or trauma, then
it would be appropriate to deal with that loss or
trauma in the treatment of the anxiety disorder
(Manassis, 2001). Similarly, if an anxious child
or adolescent has an ambivalent attachment style,
then it would be important to explore how consistently
parents respond to and cope with their
child's need for and bids for attention. If parents
respond inconsistently to their children's cues

[p. <i>305</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00323&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Research on the etiology of depression also
has implications for the treatment of children and
adolescents with dysthymia or depression. A
recent study by Duggal et al. (2001) examined
the antecedents of child and adolescent depression
in a prospective longitudinal study of
children at risk, who were from families with
lower socio-economic backgrounds. Analyses of
the factors predicting the onset of child versus
adolescent depression showed that depression in
each age group was predicted by different variables.
Depressed children were more likely to
have come from adverse family environments,
where their mothers were depressed and experiencing
high levels of stress. These children
received less supportive care in early childhood
and were more likely to have experienced abuse
(Duggal et al., 2001). In contrast, adolescents
who first became depressed in adolescence were
more likely to have experienced early care that
was characterized more specifically by a lack of
emotional support (Duggal et al., 2001).


Moreover, gender differences emerged in adolescence,
such that depressed adolescent girls
were more likely to have had a depressed mother
while depressed adolescent boys were more
likely to have experienced less emotional support
in preschool years (Duggal et al., 2001).
This gender difference was consistent with earlier
findings suggesting that adolescent girls may
identify with and become over-involved with
their depressed mothers. They may also be more
likely than adolescent males to worry about, feel
responsible for, and support their depressed
parents (Klimes-Dougan and Bolger, 1998; Duggal
et al., 2001). Again, the different etiological
pathways leading to depressive symptomatology
in childhood and adolescence suggest that clinicians
continue to explore potential historical and
current sources of the disorder and offer treatment
to both parents and children. Treatment
aimed at reducing the levels of maternal depression,
stress, and adversity experienced by young
children may reduce the likelihood that such
children will develop depressive disorders.
Treatment for depressed adolescent girls might
include mothers and focus on issues around adolescent
identity formation and individuation.


Despite the lack of empirical evidence evaluating
the role of parents in the treatment of
anxiety disorders, work by Kendall et al. (2000)
highlights the importance of parent participation
in their child-focused cognitive behavior therapy
(CBT) program. In general, they suggest that
clinicians involve parents as much as possible in
their children's assessment and treatment. With
the understanding of the role that parenting
behavior can play in the development of anxiety
disorders, clinicians need to strike a balance
between parental under- or over-involvement in
the treatment process. Clinicians should obtain
information on familial problems, parents' concerns,
and their perceptions of their children's
difficulties. Compared with other children, anxious
and depressed children report that their
families are less supportive, more conflictual, and
more controlling when making decisions (Stark
et al., 1990). Parents of anxious children often
experience guilt and anxiety about the presence
of their child's disorder and past events that may
have led to it (Kendall et al., 2000; Manassis,
2001). As such, therapists might work with
parents alone, as well as together with their
children, to deal with the role that me parents
may be playing in the maintenance of their
children's anxiety disorders.


In striking a balance between parent over- and
under-involvement, therapists could discourage
parental over-protectiveness and help parents
and families to be more supportive and cope better
with conflict (Kendall et al., 2000). They
could also help parents deal with the feelings of
guilt or anxiety about the presence of a child's
anxiety disorder and encourage them to refocus
their attention on coping with the present situation.
As such, clinicians might actively encourage
parent involvement in children's therapy by
soliciting their participation and by identifying
the importance of the role that parents can play in
keeping appointments and helping a child to
organize and follow through on homework activities.
Clinicians might also encourage parents to
pursue their own treatment; help parents to identify
and change any parent-child interaction
patterns that may be contributing to a child's
anxiety; help parents to set realistic expectations
for their children's behavior and achievement;
and help parents to teach their children to cope
with anxiety by helping their child with treatment
homework, such as relaxation exercises.
Given that anxious children often have high
standards and low self-confidence, it is particularly
important for therapists to teach parents to
reward children's partial success. Throughout
the therapeutic process, parents need to learn
how to grant their children more autonomy and
increase their confidence in coping with distressing
situations (Kendall et al., 2000).


Soliciting parental involvement in a child-focused
CBT program is one way of helping
parents to more effectively parent children with

[p. <i>306</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00324&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Akin to research on the role of parenting in the
treatment of anxiety disorders, there is also very
little research examining the role of parenting in
the treatment of depression or dysthymia in
children and adolescents (Stark et al., 2000).
There is some evidence to suggest that parent
training does not add significantly to the reduction
of child depressive symptoms, beyond that
achieved by child focused cognitive behavior
therapy (Lewinsohn et al., 1990). However, most
clinicians and researchers would argue that it is
important to involve parents in their children's
treatment for depression, for multiple reasons.
Parents can help children generalize the coping
skills that they learn in therapy to other contexts,
such as home or school. Moreover, given the
cyclical nature of depression, parents can learn to
recognize signs indicating the onset of a depressive
episode. They might be able to obtain therapeutic
support for their child at the start of an
episode, which may, in turn, reduce the length of
the episode (Stark et al., 2000).


Therapists should consider the role that
parents and the family context could play in the
maintenance or amelioration of child depression.
For instance, therapists could work with families
to reduce the level of stress experienced by a
child and work with a child to improve his/her
ability to deal with stress. If family conflict is a
source of stress, then an important goal is to
reduce that stress. Given the role that negative
thoughts or a maladaptive schema play in the
maintenance of child depression, it would be
useful for a therapist to examine, and attempt to
alter, familial verbal and non-verbal communication
patterns that are contributing to a child's
negative world view (Stark et al., 2000).


In addition to psychosocial treatments for
depression and anxiety, parents may wish to pursue
pharmacological treatments. Pharmacological
treatments should be used as part of a comprehensive
treatment plan, involving psychosocial
interventions for depressed and anxious children
and youth (Kutcher et al., 1995; Stark et al.,
2000). When blood levels are monitored, tricyclic
medications are moderately effective in
treating depression in children, but not adolescents
(Stark et al., 2000). Selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in treating
depressed adolescents, although there is little
research examining their effectiveness with
children. Busiprone may be effective in treating
GAD (Kutcher et al., 1995). Future research is
needed to examine the effectiveness of pharmacological
treatments and psychosocial treatments
that involve parents and children so that clinicians
can intervene effectively when working
with anxious and depressed children and youth
(Kutcher et al., 1995; Stark et al., 2000).


<b>AUTHORS' OVERVIEW</b>


Findings from developmental and clinical
research examining the role of parenting in the
promotion and amelioration of children's mental
health problems, and internalizing problems
in particular, present a complex and incomplete
picture. Clearly, children's mental health difficulties
result from the complex and reciprocal
interactions of multiple elements in a developmental
system involving parents, children, and
their environment. Although tensions will continue
to exist around the nature and extent of
parent, child, and environmental contributions
to children's mental health difficulties, there is
sufficient evidence to conclude at this point that
they are all important influences. When working
with individual children and their families,
it is important for clinicians to consider how the
particular pattern of parent, child, and environmental
factors are operating to promote, maintain,
or ameliorate specific child mental health
difficulties. The following implications for
practice are based on current developmental and
clinical research findings and on suggestions
from clinical researchers working with children
and youth.


<b>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE</b>


• Consider a systemic view of the etiology and
presenting symptomatology by specifically
examining the current and historical roles
that parent, child, and environmental effects
may play in the child's anxiety or depression.
Also consider the specific way in which

[p. <i>307</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00325&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• Consider the potential role that parents may
play in their children's treatment programs.


• Consider the need for parents to be involved
in their own treatment program, especially if
they are demonstrating rejecting or controlling
parenting behavior, or if they are feeling
guilty about the existence of their child's
symptoms.


• Reduce the financial and logistical barriers to
treatment that prevent parents from participating
in their children's treatment or prevent
them from helping their child to receive treatment.
Search for other ways to support parents
in their attempts to obtain treatment for
their child.


• Early in the therapeutic process, emphasize
to parents the importance of treatment completion,
including the role that it will play in
increasing therapeutic benefits. Solicit parents'
help in teaching children to generalize skills
acquired in therapy to other settings, such as
school.


• Consider both psychosocial (e.g. CBT) and
pharmacological interventions when treating
anxious and depressed children and youth.
