AT AN EARLY AGE I learned unconsciously that the way to cope
with life was to abuse substances. My grandfather abused alcohol
and then abandoned my father and his siblings. My father abused
alcohol and then abused our family. After my mother passed away
from cancer, my sister married and moved, and my brother joined
the Air Force. I was left alone to receive my father's rage. At first
I abused food but quickly turned to abusing other substances to
numb my pain.


I remember taking my first drink at thirteen years old. A
girlfriend invited me to go drinking with the crowd she was hanging
around with. Because I didn't know what effect drinking would

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt that somehow my life situation was my fault. I desperately
needed the acceptance of my peers because I felt so bad about
myself most of the time. I wanted to be viewed as normal and put
together by the outside world. I had learned I could handle a night
out with friends drinking from my trial run. It was not going to be
a big deal, and I wouldn't be made fun of. I knew that if someone
were to make fun of me, it would just confirm my suspicions of what
I already thought about myself, which wasn't worth the risk.


The next night a group of us went to a park where some boys
showed up and brought the alcohol. I was pretty confident from
my previous experience, so I acted like a pro. I don't remember
anything after being at that park because I blacked out. The next
thing I knew it was morning. I woke up in my girlfriend's bedroom,
the room spinning, and she told me I'd been hysterically funny
the night before. She also told me I had gotten really wasted and
thrown up several times in a car. The boys had dropped us at her
house, and she had had a heck of a time getting me up the stairs to
her bedroom.

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That was just one step in my process of becoming addicted.
I started smoking a year before, at twelve, smoking marijuana at
fourteen years old, and taking hard drugs at fifteen. I became bolder
as an addict, and I liked it. Because I had experienced disappointment
so often growing up with my alcoholic father, my expectations
had always been for the worst. My fears would grow inside me until
they permeated my entire being. Once I got into drugs, I felt less fear.
I spent most of my time away from my father. I stayed out at friends'
houses to party on the weekends, and it was a relief to be rarely home.


When I was home, I began to stand up to my father's drunken
rages. I also began to lie and steal. I would later see the same signs
of boldness in my daughter and son, Lauren and Ryan, as their
addictions progressed. At fourteen I stole my first painkillers from
my father. His pills had been prescribed following an emergency
appendicitis surgery, but he prided himself on not taking any pain
medication. I think the alcohol probably did the job just as well,
so his pills went untouched. He didn't miss them a bit when he
returned to the house after his operation. The day he came home
from the hospital, he got in the car and drove straight to the local
Veterans of Foreign Wars bar, his home away from home.


I don't know how I got the brilliant idea to try his morphine
pills, but I did. He had several bottles of them, and I started passing
the pills out to my friends. Some days I would swallow a handful
before I went to school. I felt dizzy afterward, like I might pass out
and never come up to life again. At the parochial school I attended,
the nun who taught my homeroom class noticed instantly that
something was wrong. She took me to the convent after school one

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next day my teacher met with my dad. I have no idea
what she said to him, but when he came home he brought us pizza
for dinner and tried to have a conversation with me, which was
definitely not typical. It felt weird to have his attention, so I just
played along. My father and I had so little communication outside
of his screaming at me that I had no idea what to say to him. I felt
so exposed. I just wanted the dinner to be over so I could go back
into my bedroom and close the door to isolate and protect myself.
My father and I were sinking deeper into our addictions, he into
his liquor and me into my pills. We had both become reclusive
when we were in our house, and the pattern that was being set
would never be broken.


I grew into an addict during the 1970s, when the hippie movement
was established, so drugs were flowing freely around me and
rebellion was in the air. It all seemed seductive and glamorous. I was
an impressionable teen, and I thought anyone drinking or doing
drugs was cool. To be caught up in this high was the opposite of all
the emotional pain I had locked inside. Feelings of depression, fear,
and shame permeated my entire being, and I was desperate to be
seen as normal. The drugs gave me the power to achieve this goal.
Instantly I could numb out my distressed emotions and gain the
acceptance I craved to lift my self-esteem.

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During my ninth-grade year, one of my girlfriends started
dating a boy who was eighteen and part of the glamorous crowd
I craved to join. He and his friends were into smoking pot, and I
remember it felt so special to be hanging out with really important
older people, like them, who had access to drugs. After the death of
my mother, I had felt only loneliness and a sense of disconnection
from everyone. I missed her terribly, and I grieved the life I knew
before her death. I knew my place in the world when she was alive.
I felt secure. As part of this older, inner circle, I was considered cool
and got that feeling back.


The first time I tried marijuana, I felt nothing. I couldn't
understand what the big deal was. The second time I tried it, I felt
the effect and loved it. It took the pain of life away, and I craved
that release. It took the edge off, and I became a daily pot smoker,
though it didn't take long before I experimented with other drugs,
too. I continued stealing from my dad to fund my habit. I took
money from him instead of painkillers. I would sneak into his bedroom
and steal out of his wallet after he had passed out following a
night at the bar. I would have risked anything to get my high at that
point. I was scared to death of my father, but I would creep into his
room anyway, every time I needed money. Even in broad daylight I
would steal what I needed to get my fix. Sometimes I had to tiptoe
inches from his slumbering body to rifle through the pockets of his
pants hanging next to him on the bedpost.


I don't know if he ever knew I was doing this, but I never got
caught. I never got into trouble with my father over drugs, but he
did find out that I was using alcohol because I got caught drinking

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I knew that I couldn't tell my father what had happened. He
would blow up in his usual way and maybe even more. I was unwilling
to find out how much more anger I might unleash in him. For
the next three days I got up and got dressed for school as if I weren't
suspended, but instead of walking to school I sneaked down to the
basement and hid. I sat there quietly until I heard my father leave
for work. When I went back to school, the principal asked where my
father was because I hadn't brought him with me. I admitted that
I hadn't told my dad and just stood there waiting to see what the
principal would do. I figured anything that came was better than
dealing with my father's ferocity, but my hopes were dashed when I
observed a sad look of resignation on the principal's face, just before
he told me there was no getting around my father's anger. He was
going to call my dad himself and tell him the news I hadn't.


That night I was scared to death. I waited for my father to
come home, but he didn't show up until two in the morning. I heard
him come in, then he opened the door to my bedroom and walked
up to me. He slapped me in the face, said nothing, and walked out
of my room. My cheek stung at first, but then it just felt numb. It

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next time he yelled at me, I snapped. I told him I couldn't
take it anymore, and that I felt like I was losing my mind. A look of
fear came over his face when I finally exploded. The only time I had
seen him look so fearful was when my mother lay dying. He began
to sob, and then he grabbed me. My father hugged me, said he loved
me, and told me he would get me some help. He said, "I love you."
It's the only time I remember those words leaving my father's lips.


He promised to take me for an appointment with a psychologist,
but I didn't think I was crazy. I needed something to deal
with the pain we caused each other, sure, because I couldn't take
the emotional battering anymore, but I didn't need a hospital.
Still, he made an appointment at a mental hospital in a nearby
town. My father found the hospital on a recommendation from
his boss, because he also had a daughter in need of "help." As we
drove up to the hospital, I noticed bars were on all the windows of
the building. I was petrified that the hospital staff would keep me
there and lock me up.


My father and I met with a psychologist at the hospital,
together and then individually. I was taken back there several more
times, and I remember the psychologist telling me that our situation
was not my fault. This was well and good, but it didn't change anything

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Eventually we stopped the hospital appointments. I never knew
why, but years later my sister told me that the visits were stopped
because my father must have decided he didn't want to take me there
anymore. The vice principal at my high school had called my sister,
in Florida, because the hospital contacted him with concerns about
me after my father and I stopped our appointments. The hospital
had tried to contact my father, but he never returned the calls.


This was when my father remarried. I was in high school when
he and Nora wed. She was a hard woman who was unkind to me.
She could drink my father under the table, but the good news was
that after my dad met Nora, he stopped his drunken rages in the
night. This didn't stop all the chaos, though, because Nora and I
did not get along. Sometimes out of nowhere she would accuse me
of things I hadn't done, like the time she accused me of stealing her
car and going joyriding. I didn't even know how to drive. When I
tried to defend myself against her wild stories, Nora would tell me
she "had my number," and not to mess with her. Some nights when
she and my father came home from the bar, I could hear Nora asking
my dad if he loved her more than me.

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I overheard a lot of what my father and Nora talked about.
Over the years I heard some pretty hurtful things. I felt so alone
and unloved. I remember hiding in the corner of my closet in
the dark with the door shut so they couldn't hear me sobbing. If
I could hear them, I knew they could hear me, and I didn't want
to appear weak. If Nora were to know how devastated I felt over
the things that were said, I knew it would please her, and I wasn't
going to give her the satisfaction. Somehow it felt like she was
jealous of me, but I had no idea why. Maybe it was because everyone
said how much I resembled my mother. I never knew.


I moved out of my father's home the day after high school
graduation. After that, life was a constant party for me. A girl I
worked with had a brother who had connections. We used to get
crystal meth, which is a potent form of speed. I had tried speed in
the form of amphetamines before that and had kind of liked the
effects, but I fell madly in love with crystal meth. It gave me energy.
I felt great. I could drink all night and never get drunk, I had amazing
self-confidence, and I could talk for hours, feeling like I was the
most interesting person in the world.


By that time I had lost interest in pot because it no longer
made me feel good. I later learned that marijuana is a depressant.
It slows the nervous system to a hazy halt. My switch to meth
was a chemical solution to the level of addiction I had to pot,
which no longer gave me the high it had at first. I just felt kind
of depressed when I used pot, and I craved the same high I knew
when I first experienced life on drugs. On meth it came back in
spades. I was superhuman and would sometimes go for days with

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One weekend, my roommates and I pooled our money to
purchase meth and did the drug together, staying up all night to
snort lines of the stuff. We decided to attend the county fair high
on meth and had a blast. We stayed high through an entire Saturday,
but by Saturday night, my roommates had lost interest in the
remaining stash. I stayed home alone and finished it off. I had no
shutoff valve when it came to meth. As long as there were good
drugs around, I would use them up until they were gone.


I never feared overdosing or any other of the potential
consequences of my behavior during that time. I couldn't even
fathom how someone could just walk away and say they didn't
want to do any more. It wasn't in my DNA to say no, but I wasn't
as superhuman as I felt. The weekend of the meth binge and the
fair, I hadn't slept since the Thursday before I started doing meth
with my friends. After I hit the remaining stash by myself, I began
to feel sharp pains in my chest. I felt like my heart was going to
burst out of my body and knew I was in trouble. It was one of
those moments that are rare, when for a flashing second it became
very clear that the consequences of my actions could mean life or
death. I had to do something drastic to save my life, which meant
possibly revealing my addictions, and yet I was able to understand
that the only alternative was death. I realized I wanted to live. I

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I spent the night in the hospital on an IV to counteract the
drugs. The embarrassment of getting caught did not seem nearly so
important by then. I worried that soon my father would appear and
find me in this collapsed state, but a blessing only an addict can
appreciate occurred in the hospital. I learned it was illegal to inform
my dad about my condition because I was over the age of eighteen,
which meant my secret was safe from him, and from the hatred
of Nora, because I was a legal adult. He never found out. Still,
the shock of what had almost happened to me did curb my drug
use after that time. I was scared and decided to compromise with
myself. I made a vow to stick with alcohol and milder drugs only,
like marijuana or painkillers, because I was afraid of what drugs had
done to me but not scared enough to quit.


I had only been out of my father's home and in my own
apartment for a few months when I decided that maybe what I
needed was a change of scenery, so I got on a plane and went to
Florida, where my sister lived. Things didn't go well there. As soon
as I had an opportunity to leave, I did. I was offered a position as
a baby sitter for a family that was relocating, and I jumped at the
chance, landing in a town in Montana, where I decided to stay. I
found a job and rented an apartment there, and I made the kind
of friends I thought were normal people, people that went to bars,
got drunk, and did drugs. It was lonely in Montana at first. But
soon I met tons of people that lived like I did. In Montana I met

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Rick and I were both barely twenty years old when we met.
We were both into the party scene. I thought that after we were
married, our habits would change and things would settle down for
us. I started to slow down some, but Rick was just warming up. His
drinking and drug use escalated as the years went on. I couldn't
stand the fact that he had to drink constantly, and also do drugs,
and we fought often about it. I justified the criticisms I had against
him by believing that I had the self-control to curb my behaviors
when I wanted to. Rick did not. He smoked pot and drank every
day. On the weekends we partied together, because in those days
I allowed myself to binge, though I no longer smoked marijuana
and sensed that I was considered uncool because of this choice. It
brought back all the feelings of embarrassment I had always feared.
I believed that not smoking made me look weak to other people and
thought they were beginning to write me off as a lightweight.


What had changed was my tolerance for the environment
around Rick and me. In the early days of our marriage, we lived
with addicted friends, and our house turned into a community pot
smoking den. I chose not to be part of this party because I'd become
a binge addict who used only on weekends, while Rick and the
others at our house were feeding their daily needs. I rationalized the
exclusion I felt by telling myself I wasn't an addict, like the people
I knew. Addicts were people like Rick and his friends, people that
had to use every day and couldn't live without their drugs. The

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But I did need them, so I ignored the fact that I had fallen out
of the cool crowd at our house. I concentrated on the idea that my
cycle of addiction was a type of intelligence other people I knew
didn't have. I told myself I wasn't quite as bad off as Rick and his
friends were. He and the drug users that came and went in our
home, and even my father before them, they were the ones who
were screwed up. Pot had never regained the first effect it had on
my life, and by this time alcohol would give me bad hangovers, so
I picked and chose when I was going to party to do the hard drugs
that gave me the high I wanted, and only those. This habit left me
isolated from the normal routine in our house of casual pot and
liquor but made me feel smarter than everyone else.


I had never heard of a binge alcoholic, or addict, at that time.
It was the summer I turned twenty-one. Of course I know better
now. If I had known about binge behaviors, I might have been able
to respond better to the news I received that my father had a stroke,
but because I thought I was better than him because I wasn't an
addict, I thought I could handle watching him die. After I arrived
at his bedside, I was told he most likely would not live beyond a few
days. The doctor had been telling him for years that if he didn't
quit drinking, it was eventually going to kill him. It did. I saw my
father alive and unconscious one last time in a hospital. I buried
my dad back home, in a plot right next to my mom, and returned
to my life with Rick. When I returned, I was just as addicted as ever

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Pressures were mounting around Rick and me, aside from our
addictions. Rick had invited a transient, who had gray hair and a
beard, to live with us. Rick let him into our life because the transient
was "cool" and smoked pot. I thought the man smelled like he hadn't
taken a bath in a year. There was also a drug dealer in Montana who
lived down the street from Rick and me. His name was Joey. He and
Rick became fast friends, using our house to do IV drugs, which in my
mind were for hardcore addicts only, and were as low as one could go.
That wasn't me, or us. I had tolerated Rick's daily pot smoking and
the constant beer drinking, but even for his level of behavior, IV drug
use was where I had to draw the line for us both. In addition, Rick
didn't work when we were first married. After I lost the job that had
been supporting us, he flipped. He screamed at me to go get another
job, but I refused until he got one first. This was about the time I
found out that I was pregnant with our first child, Jason. Rick's dad
had a serious talk with his son after learning this news, and it didn't
take long before Rick was working at a good job.

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For a brief time, I felt safe. Maybe things would start to settle
down, I thought. On a weekend before I delivered our son, though,
Rick and I were still at it, partying with friends that had scored a
form of speed called white crosses. I took the drugs even though I
knew it was not the best idea while I was pregnant. Our son Jason
was born one month premature, with his lungs underdeveloped, and
the doctor who delivered Jason didn't know if he would live at all. I
was lucky Jason was not born with a more serious complication from
my amphetamine use, and yet this scare had a sobering effect that
was regrettably short-lived. Like before, when I nearly overdosed on
meth at the county fair, I compromised by bingeing to believe I had
control over my drug use. Sometimes either Rick or I would stay
home with Jason, so the other could go out alone to the bars with
friends to drink, drug, and flirt. The fights we had after Jason was
born all seemed to revolve around accusations that one of us drank
too much or used too many drugs, or went off to the bars without
the other, yet we kept right on doing all of these things.


We had Lauren during this time. At the time of her birth,
Jason was three years old. Rick announced that year that he wanted
to go to Oregon, to look for a better paying job. I didn't want to
travel with a newborn, but Rick insisted that we all go. On the trip
he hooked up with an old drug buddy and scored amphetamines.
During the drive, Rick also bought beer, mixing the speed with
the liquor as he drove our car. The trip had been stressful and I
just needed something to take the edge off, so I popped a pill and
washed it down with a beer. I don't remember much about the accident,
but I do remember the car flipping through the air. The next

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387560-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Just to listen to this news, I required heavy painkillers and
sedatives. I was hysterical. Three days later, Rick and I had to
sign the papers to take Jason off life support. The numb feeling I'd
known all my life spread out its heavy blanket across my soul, and
denial once again became my constant companion as Rick and I
flew back to Montana with Jason's body, to prepare for the funeral.
I took double and triple doses of any pain medication the doctor
would give me. The reality of it all began to creep in when Rick
and I were at the funeral home and Jason's body was carried out in
a small, white casket.


For years I had not known how to reach the part of myself that
would allow me to express the fact that my relationships with men
had been chaotic and led to disappointing things. I had been subjected
all my life to the raging tirades of an addicted, drunken man.
He had died from alcoholism, my husband was an alcoholic, and then
my son had died from an alcohol-related accident. Despite any lie I
told myself, I was living the legacy of addiction without even knowing
it was affecting me until Jason's death. I still didn't see my own addiction,
but I definitely knew that Rick's was affecting me in ways I could
no longer deny. Living with addiction, up to that point, had actually
seemed normal to me because that is all I'd ever known.
