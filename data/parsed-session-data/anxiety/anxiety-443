ONE AFTERNOON, I was having a conference with a student.
As we were finishing, she mentioned that she was
struggling with a term paper for her psych class. She
wanted to write it about adults who had been sexually abused as
children.


"Well, that's a good topic," I said offhandedly. "There must
be loads of source materials."


The student shrugged, then said the real problem was that,
as part of the assignment, the professor required that she interview
someone involved with the topic and include a case
history.


I had been in therapy for seven months. I didn't know it, but
the first small jolt of reconnection was about to hit.


"How," the student mused aloud, "would I even find someone
who was sexually abused?"


Inside, I heard a voice say: Well, <i>I</i> was...


Then other voices kicked up a panicked chorus.


The next thing I knew, the student was saying, "Ms. Phillips?
Ms. Phillips?"


"I'm sorry," I told her. "I'm not feeling well."


She guessed it was probably the flu that was going around.
She'd heard it was hitting very suddenly. Anyway, she said,
getting up, she thought she'd better find another topic for her
paper.


"Probably a good idea," I told her.

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00189&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went home, wept, hammered my fists into my pillow, and,
the next day, white and shaky but not from the flu, I told my
psychologist with enormous difficulty that I had suddenly realized
that that childhood assault had actually happened. What's more,
I realized, it had happened to me.


"To <i>me</i>," I whispered, and then did little but cry for the rest
of the session.


Again and again, I tested the truth of this realization that had
come roaring out of nowhere: <i>I</i> had been that young child who
had been seized and flung down on the floor. That had been <i>my</i>
arm that had been wrenched, <i>my</i> head that hit the clothes dryer.
Worse, that had been <i>my</i> brother and he had certainly meant to
do me harm.


"Everything is different," I said at one point, and found myself
reaching out to touch the things around me as if to somehow
reorient myself to the physical world.


"Everything will always be different from here on out," my
therapist told me. Then we just sat. When the hour was up, he
smiled gravely and said, "Welcome back."


Years later, my therapist would often express his regret that it
had taken him so long to recognize my multiplicity, especially
since, although he viewed himself as something of a free thinker
within his profession, he had adhered to the then-standard professional
belief that multiplicity was a rarity and that it might
indeed be caused by a patient's response to the therapist's actions
and expectations. There is no way, of course, to change the timing
of my diagnosis. But now that an opposite professional trend seems
to be under way--the rapid and immediate diagnosis of multiplicity
--it seems to me that I was almost lucky, because I had
the chance to experience the fundamental principles of the therapeutic
process and the chance to gain some confidence in myself
before I was identified as a multiple. It was as if, before setting
out on a perilous voyage, I had a few first tastes of dirty weather,

[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00190&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the weeks that followed that first jolt of reconnection, I often
picked at the mystery of this first recounted trauma. How could
I not have remembered being cornered in the laundry room?
Where had this memory been? It spooked me that something so
significant could have been so successfully hidden from my conscious
view. I began to think of the memory itself as a solitary
bead that I had found in some deep corner of a pocket or hidden
in the bottom of a drawer. The odd thing was that the rest of my
life, the events that I had remembered all along had already been
neatly strung onto the bead-thread of my life story. And so this
stray bead was startling. I knew it was mine. I knew it matched
the others; yet it presented me with only awkward choices. For a
while I kept it separate. I fingered it, studied it at all hours of
the day and night, looked at it in natural light, held it up to all
the other beads to find the place where it might fit.


In the coming weeks, when I was often distracted and unnerved
by other memories of Hank's behavior, I sometimes told
myself that getting better simply meant finding my other lost bits
of time, examining them, getting to know their heft and their
significance, then working them somehow into my history. Perhaps,
I told myself, I could be a kind of emotional archaeologist,
discovering and sequencing my own history.


It was a nice illusion while it lasted. A string of beads is such
a tidy, linear object--which time and memory, I soon learned,
certainly are not. And therapy would never be as methodical as
archaeology; our findings would be scattered and chaotic, the layers,
the shards, the quadrants impossible to distinguish.


In the coming months, scrap after scrap of my sexual history
fluttered in the forefront of my consciousness. I could not bring
myself to talk about them, but I couldn't stop them, either. At
night, it was increasingly difficult to fall asleep and almost impossible

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00191&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally, I sat late one night at my kitchen table and wrote
down everything I could recall about sex. I hoped that getting it
all on paper would allow me to stop remembering it. I also took
a vow that night: I swore that I would always try to tell the
absolute truth, even when I found it sickening. The whole project
took me until after midnight, and then, feeling drained but desperate
and in dire need of sleep, I took the letter into town, forced
myself to mail it to my psychologist, and staggered home to bed.


A few days later, I slunk into his office feeling bitter and
ashamed.


"Do you want to talk about this?" he said, briefly lifting the
letter from his desk.


"No," I said.


"We won't if you don't want to," he said, smiling. "But it
really helped me to get the background."


I harrumpfed.


He sat back in his chair and mused. "Sex," he said, "has caused
you nothing but trouble."


I glared at him. "I thought we weren't going to talk
about it."


He shrugged. "We're not," he said.

[p. <i>173</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00192&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I scowled out the window and resumed my silence.


After a few minutes my therapist began to muse again. "It's
interesting, though, isn't it, that--"


"<i>Please</i>," I said.


"Sorry," he said, then closed his eyes and folded his hands.


There were times to talk, but there were also times to be silent
and to wait. Both he and I would have to learn this; for him, it
would be the hardest lesson of our work together.


My sleeping patterns grew steadily worse. I screamed in the night.
I woke every forty-five minutes, I woke at three in the morning
and didn't go back to sleep, and after truly scouring nightmares,
I simply got out of bed, got dressed, and huddled on my couch
waiting for the sun to rise.


More and more our sessions centered only on the question of
sleep--or my general lack thereof. My skin was growing more
and more pale, and my hands were acquiring something of a tremble.
At times I was so exhausted it seemed almost too much work
to breathe.


"How did you sleep when you were a kid?" my therapist
asked.


I gave him a blank look. At first, I remembered only that
grim prayer about dying in my sleep and the occasional privilege
of having my cats sleep at the foot of my bed.


But then the rest of it came slowly back: the funny stories
told about my walking and talking in my sleep, my terrible fear
of allowing myself to sleep because of what might happen if I did,
my parents' impatience with children who did not go to bed and
<i>stay</i> there, the nights when, as punishment, I would not be allowed
to have the cats on my bed. Some nights, I forced myself to stay
awake until everyone had gone to bed, and then, in the belief that
if I couldn't be found I couldn't be hurt, I slept in some odd
cubbyhole in the house: on the floor in closets, in my laundry
hamper, behind a chair in the living room. Other nights, I simply

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00193&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Our discussion prompted me to try the old childhood trick of
sleeping somewhere else when I felt too frightened to be in bed.
I made my way to the couch or to an upholstered chair on the
deck; sometimes I even sprawled, with my sleepy but gleeful dogs,
on the living-room floor.


But that was all that I would try. My psychologist made suggestion
after suggestion: self-hypnosis, keeping a written record
of each night, relaxation, hypnosis in the office, even calling him
at home at two A.M. when I could take no more.


"I'm okay," I said, week after week. "I can tough it out."


Sleep just couldn't be worth all this effort. There was no way,
I believed, that I could overcome the terrors of the night, and each
evening, as the sky gradually grew dark, I grew increasingly anxious,
knowing I would have to get through another night.


Finally, one week, my therapist shook his head angrily.


"Jane," he said. "You don't seem to acknowledge <i>my</i> responsibility
here."


"Yours?"


I dug my hands under my thighs to steady them.


"If this keeps up," he said, "I'll have to think about having
your driver's license pulled."


I shrank back in my chair.


"I can't <i>sleep!</i>" I said, feeling the surge of nastiness that comes
over me when I feel threatened and exhausted. "I'm <i>sorry</i>."


"Jane," he said. "What if you're in an accident?"


I wanted to make my <i>So what?</i> face, but didn't. All I needed
was another lecture on why I wasn't supposed to kill myself and
I would probably just go home and get it over with.


He turned his chair away from me, and I saw his shoulders
fall. "Since you won't let <i>me</i> help you," he said, fed up and a little
weary, "go and do some reading. Find your own way out."

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00194&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We were near the end of the session. "Fine," I said, getting
up and stalking out. "I will." And in something of a huff I went
to the library.


Not only did I learn about sleep, but I learned one other
principle I would need as I set out toward integration: I am so
removed from certain ordinary experiences that I have no idea
what I am missing; I certainly don't know what I need to ask
about or learn.


What I read first were books and articles on normal sleep, and
I admit that I was stunned. I'd had no idea, actually, why human
beings slept. Before my reading, sleep had seemed like some peculiar
human tradition, a nightly test of bravery I inevitably failed.
Why anyone in her right mind participated in this trial I had no
idea. What perfectly sane person would strip off her clothes, turn
off the lights, and willingly give up consciousness?


What I learned, however, were things probably every school-child
knows: sleep is a physical need. Somehow, in the midst of
my fears, I had neglected to learn that it is only during sleep that
the body replenishes its hormones and thus shores up its immune
system. Only during sleep can the body right its balance of depleted
chemicals, heal its wounds, and recover from its illnesses.


To my surprise, I also learned that good sleep begets good
sleep. I'd had no idea that my sleep deprivation, because of my
bad nights, very nearly guaranteed that following nights would
be just as bad or even worse. The more tired I was when I went
to bed, the more likely I was to suffer those weird and lifelike
nightmares when I first dropped off to sleep. Throughout the rest
of the night, I was no doubt experiencing an ongoing cycle of
REM deficit and rebound, triggering still more hellish dreams.
Worse, sleep deprivation was probably also causing me to remain
for longer periods in delta sleep, but those longer periods of the
deepest of sleeps were the breeding ground of sleep terrors--those
blind, pitch-black wakenings I supposedly should have outgrown
in childhood.

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If other people could go to bed and sleep at night, I decided
that I could learn to do it, too. I established a regular bedtime,
and planned to stay up late no more than one night a week. I
addressed the question of safety and comfort, installing new locks,
putting a flashlight near the bed, and buying flannel sheets and a
new comforter. My therapist and I worked on some contingency
plans. What would I do when I had nightmares? Under what
circumstances would I get out of bed? How many bad nights
would I have in a row before taking a day off to sleep on the
couch during the safety of daylight hours?


Every night, I grimly headed off to bed right on time. I hated
it, but gradually the new strategies worked. My sleep was, and
remains, quite disturbed from time to time, but it began to
change from a problem with its own potentially serious consequences
to an indicator that there is trouble afoot somewhere in
my system.


One night I went to sleep very tired, fell asleep, and woke
within minutes screaming because of a horrific nightmare. I sat
up, blinked groggily, then dug down a little deeper under the
covers. "Hypnogogic hallucination," I mumbled to myself, and
then woke up again, laughing this time at the utterly casual way
I identified and accepted what had once so thoroughly frightened
me. I knew I finally had the problem licked.


I had been in therapy for two years when some colleagues and I
took a group of students on a field trip. The week-in, week-out
nature of therapy was often wearing, and I could think of nothing
better than hopping on a bus with a group of language majors.
We would spend a few hours in the art museum, then after some
free time, meet for dinner at a French restaurant and go listen to
a chamber orchestra. The trip, I thought, would give me a little
break from all my internal turmoil and travail. What I got, instead,
was a reminder of the relentless nature of the therapeutic

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00196&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The day began well enough. We arrived at the art museum,
and a lively curator gave us a witty but insightful tour. Afterwards,
as the students went their own way for a few hours, I
wandered back through certain galleries.


I was reminded of a field trip I'd once taken in a humanities
course when I was a college junior. We were visiting an art museum
and then had tickets to a play. At the museum, it had turned
out that because of my current rabid interest in art history, I knew
more about some of the paintings than my professor did, and, as
I was something of a favorite student, he gladly turned the commentary
over to me. After a while, my fellow students wandered
off, and, for the next hour or so, the professor and I had roamed
quite amiably, alternately discussing paintings and my future.


As I was leaving the museum, I was remembering that afternoon,
a little wistfully since the professor was now long-dead. I
was musing with some affection over the cheek I must have had
to have taken over like that when I caught sight of a tall young
woman striding along with long flying hair, a dramatic hat pulled
down over one eye, and a portfolio under one arm.


Suddenly I saw myself again, in my last college years: my hair
was long and streaming, too, and I had sauntered everywhere as
if driven by some ferocity of purpose. I had even worn my grandmother's
cast-off, calf-length mink, and had had a hat with a
marvelously theatric brim.


I stood and watched the young woman dodge her way across
the street, and I thought she looked quite stunning and perhaps
a little daunting. And then, across the chasm of dissociation, there
was a jolt of reconnection: My god, I thought, I'm a woman, too.


If multiplicity works by assigning various tasks and pieces of
information to separate parts, integration takes place when tasks
or information are somehow shared. For me, this sharing began

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00197&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The rest of the trip was a nightmare. I spent the afternoon
sitting in a bar. I found a window seat on a busy street, sipped a
glass of wine for hours, and examined everyone who walked by.
How on earth, I wondered, did anyone get through the day with
the enormous burden of their sexuality? I tried not to think about
everything that had happened to me only because I <i>was</i> female. I
felt tricked, duped, exposed. How could I not have <i>known?</i> How
was I ever going to survive? And why <i>now?</i>


I limped through dinner, fending off comments on how quiet
I was, and later I was grateful for the hush and darkness of the
concert hall. That night I cried for four straight hours in the
darkness of the bus, but I didn't know which was the worse tragedy:
having been born a girl or discovering that fact, in this visceral,
undeniable way, at the age of thirty-one.

[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00198&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Integration, I was learning, raised frightening and far-reaching
questions; some of these would challenge my most fundamental
beliefs about myself and about the world. Recalling a string of
unpleasant, even damaging, childhood events was only the beginning.
Unless I was willing to examine all answers to the questions
that came surging up from my subconscious, therapy was useless.
And, unless I was willing to act in some new way, seeing a therapist
two hours every week was merely self-indulgent.


In the months that followed the sighting of my feminine self
on the art museum stairs, I changed in a disturbing way: I suddenly
found other women absolutely fascinating. I watched my
women students, I watched my women colleagues, I watched the
women at my gym with a compulsion that scared me half to death.
I could barely take my eyes off them: how they talked, sat, moved,
dressed, did their hair. I was fascinated by the range of behavior
I saw in women: the student who might come to class one day in
suit and heels and the next day in jeans and track shoes or a friend
who might painstakingly do her nails, and then within the hour
go out and weed her garden. I wanted to ask why people were
piercing more holes in their ears, how they had learned to be so
expert with their makeup, how they knew what to tell their hairdressers.
Certain women I found incredibly attractive during this
time, and I gnawed incessantly over the question of whether or
not I was gay.


One afternoon, my therapist allowed me to read through the
answers I had given during my initial testing. In the margin, next
to my response to an apperception image of a half-naked woman
lying on a bed with a man standing nearby wearing a tie, someone
had written, in a large, confident script, "Is she gay?"


"I didn't write that," my therapist said.


I nodded. He had not administered the tests; obviously the
note had been made by the psychologist who had.


I shifted in my chair, made a face, and took a deep breath.
"Well, but do you think I am?"

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00199&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Gay?" he said. He smiled and cocked his head. "Well, do
<i>you</i> think so?"


"I don't know," I said, then thought. "Probably not, anyway."


"What does your gut say?"


I laughed. "Well, okay, my <i>gut</i> says no." I paused. "Definitely
no."


He laughed, too. "I'd be surprised if you were," he said, then
added, carefully hedging his bets: "It wouldn't be the end of the
world, though."


I will admit that I was relieved. I did not <i>want</i> to be gay. I
am not a homophobe, and have several friends who are gay; in
fact, it is the quality of their lives that led me to hope so desperately
that I was straight. Although in some ways society seems
more accepting, too many of the gay people I know lead their
lives either in fear of discovery or with a kind of tiring bravado.
My life seemed hard enough without that.


It took a while, but it finally came to me that I was passing
through a belated stage of adolescence, when girls do indeed study
one another and sometimes develop crushes on other girls they
admire. My perception suddenly shifted, and I realized that
women I was worrying about feeling attracted to were women I
admired. I didn't: want to be <i>with</i> them; what I wanted was to <i>be</i>
them.


I decided to study all the women that I chose. I had not been
paying much attention to the question of womanhood all these
years, and I had plenty of lost time to make up for. For quite
some time, I went on watching women the same way one might
wander through car dealerships scanning the new models. I was
scouting prospects, trying to see what kind of a woman I might
want to be, and taking notes on what I might need to learn.


In the end, the question of sexual orientation quietly receded.
Later, when I learned I was a multiple, it became clear how complex
the issue of sexual orientation can be. Most multiples have
alters of different genders, and if executive control is determined

[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00200&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the end of one summer vacation, I came out of a depression
with a new insight into myself and my life: I was smart, perceptive,
full of ideas and opinions--and yet I never spoke up at the
college. As my mood brightened, it seemed clear that this would
be the year I would become a more active participant in the faculty
discussions and debates.


Well, okay, said my psychologist, but take it easy.


We were beginning to learn that I never take anything easy,
and at the beginning of that academic year, within minutes of my
first opportunity, I was launched on some point or other about
which I had strong and genuine opinions. The problem was that
even as I spoke I heard the sound of a cocking gun and a whispered
threat: "You're gonna die, Jane." The safety goes <i>click-click</i>.
"You're gonna die." <i>Click-click, click-click</i>.


I had been through enough to know the voice was Hank's,
and that it was rising from my memory as if I'd tripped some
invisible audio switch.


I toughed out the meeting, kept on talking, then rushed back
to my office. As I sat with my head down on my desk, I realized
that it wasn't my stupidity that kept me from speaking out at
meetings: I didn't express myself because I was afraid of dying.
But just how reasonable was that fear? At the time, I had a cloudy
understanding of the concepts of "past" and "present." So instead
of being able to understand the simple fact that I was thirty-five
and not ten, and that my brother was sitting in some far-off boardroom,
not here, I attended every meeting at school that semester

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It came to me that the vigilance of the traumatized comes, in
part, from the need to guard against both the past and the present.
If something happened once, I seemed to believe, it could happen
again, and my "job" as it were was to maintain a constant vigilance
not only against what might happen to me right this minute,
but to guard simultaneously against everything that had ever
happened to me in the past. I had five years of practice, in dozens
of situations, painfully separating the past from the present and
working up the courage to test the difference between reality and
my perception of it. Once the diagnosis was made, I needed every
scrap of faith and confidence I'd acquired to continue in the
process.


Trust was the one thing I failed to acquire. From the very beginning
of our work together, my therapist pointed out that it would
help if I could bring myself to trust him. He explained trust,
offered examples of it, made promises of what he would and would
not do.


I can't even pretend that I believed him. I trusted no one, I
had ample reasons for trusting no one, and I wasn't going to trust
him either. I almost hate to recall the lengths to which he went
in order to foster trust. There were a few extra-long appointments
which helped me to get to know him better, although I still
considered trust out of the question. He wrote on more than one
appointment card that I could reach him by phone twenty-four
hours a day. I never called. He did his best to remember and
follow through on the slightest things, from how I drank my tea

[p. <i>183</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Nothing worked. I didn't trust him, I wasn't necessarily interested
in trusting him, and frankly I felt he wasted a lot of
valuable time talking about it. I liked him, though. He was smart,
and bright, and usually compassionate. He listened with almost
uncanny care, but he could be witty and irreverent, too. On the
other hand, sometimes I was afraid of him, and sometimes he just
didn't seem to understand me at all. At times, all that kept me
from skipping my appointments was a promise I'd once made to
myself that no matter how humiliating, how painful, or how
frightening it was, I wouldn't abandon the therapeutic process.


That vow, however, and all I learned in the first five years,
was just enough to carry me into the rough wild seas of treating
my true disorder. He was right, though: trust would have eased
the voyage.
