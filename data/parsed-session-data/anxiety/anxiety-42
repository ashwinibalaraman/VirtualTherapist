COUNSELOR: Client 0324-006 interview number eight November 10, 1970 Client 0324-006 November 10, 1970 Interview number eight.


PATIENT: I'm sorry I'm late. I just woke up. 


COUNSELOR: Same old stuffness (ph)?


PATIENT: Yeah. It's combination of same old stuffness (ph) and also, things have been really good for the last two days and I can't think of anything that I really quotes need to talk about. Everything that at various times comes up and bothers me is like at least one layer removed.


COUNSELOR: Um hm.


PATIENT: And you know in a way I know that it is still there but it has the illusion of being gone.


COUNSELOR: OK.


PATIENT: And I'd just a soon (inaudible) that it stay gone. And.


COUNSELOR: It is nice (ph) not to be crowded and pushed by everything at once. It maybe just nice to sort of let it all lie for awhile.


PATIENT: Maybe.


COUNSELOR: [It doesn't really sound it wasn't really right.] (ph) It wasn't where you were.


PATIENT: I'm.....


COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 2:42)


PATIENT: I'm not sure. It's like in the last several days I've had some really, really bad times between whenever I guess it was last Wednesday and now and fantastically bad times. And I've got so that I'm, would managed to write about how I felt before I went to sleep and I found that it was a really good thing. For one thing it sort of made my room my castle and I could feel ok being by myself which was kind of one thing I really resolved after I left you. (inaudible at 3:38) my boyfriend again I didn't care. If I didn't talk to my roommate again I wasn't going to get upset about it and so whereas those nights in a lot of ways would be pure hell by the next day things would be ok. I think I managed to go to work both last Thursday (inaudible at 4:13) after not going this Wednesday because I felt really, really out of it. And I felt really good then and I somehow managed to accomplish a whole bunch of things this weekend and yesterday and this morning and I had my family therapy case this morning and I was just really on top of things.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And I went for a walk with my roommate on the point (ph) on Sunday and I felt really good. It was, I had driven my boyfriend to the airport at 5:00 o'clock in the morning and come back and gone to sleep and I just sort of felt that I was managing to run everything and not let anything bother me and taken care of things and accomplishing things very well.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: I took him to the airport and then met his sister (inaudible at 5:30) who is in for the weekend and so I had her come over and fixed her breakfast and made sure she got off on her way ok. But just to she's about five years younger than I am and just she's just kind of like a little sister that I really like and.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And I could really kind of relate to her but kind of (inaudible at 5:58) viewpoint. And I don't know then I went on this walk around the lake and I just, it was really gloomy and the lake was had some really beautiful waves and I really was like I guess up until the night before well actually even that night I was still feeling really really suicidal and I mean like really really debating about it a couple of those nights. I guess it was like Saturday night and Sunday night or Friday night and Saturday night I don't remember which and somehow during the day on Sunday down at that lake it's like she talked about some of her friends that just sort of felt like jumping into the sea and just swimming forever and that kind of thing and we both kind of talked about the life qualities of it and I don't know it was it was in a lot of ways a very existential kind of thing with neither of us really saying our own feelings and that we all we both would probably also really felt like jumping at various times. And but putting it really abstractly like we were friends and we could understand what it was kind of like and we weren't really out there alone something like that. But it was like I was really when I went out there I just was really saying no to it or you know that I just really knew that I didn't that I felt very much like living and very comfortable with the living situation that I have at the time. Or just the way it had developed at that point and that there wasn't anything threatening to me in that. (8:21)


COUNSELOR: Yeah so it sounds almost like in a way it was like talking about a friend that's like knowing how completely different or you when you fell completely differently feel so at that point it really got clear that you feel that when.


PATIENT: Yeah in a sense that's really true. It's like for once I really didn't have the temptation to jump in but I remembered being on the beach when I had. And I don't know kind of yesterday was like a really really effective day and I was really torn and I had this awful headache and my boyfriend said I could pick him up at the airport or not if I like and I decided to because I didn't need to


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And because I didn't feel dependent on him. In a sense his phone call really upset me because I had managed to put him out of my mind on Sunday night and I think it is after he called that I started writing unhappy things and I couldn't go to sleep until like three in the morning which is why I was tired all day Monday. But so that his call in a sense had upset me but somehow I managed all day Monday to kind of forget and kind of function anyway and do a good job functioning so that like by the time I picked him up at the airport it was raining it was really pouring it was gorgeous and I ended up and I told him and I said "I just really came down here to see the airplanes in the water cause it was really pretty and I'm really glad you gave me an excuse"


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And in some sense it was true. I really enjoyed it. And then I had like he was going to come over and I had conveniently forgotten his keys which was real and I really worried about that because I didn't want him to think that I was sort of chasing after him which is kind of why I had his sister left his keys with me. Which is kind of why I debated whether to go to the airport because I thought well I don't want him to think this means I'm chasing after him. (10:49)


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And yet I really felt so we moved from that that it wasn't even effecting me. So much so that like he came over to get the keys and I was going to have dinner and he probably would have stayed there and there was this message to call a friend and there turned out to be an extra ticket for a play that was going on at 7:30 and this was 7:15 and a really good friend of mine a guy that I know and had gotten to know this summer when my boyfriend was gone and was just a good friend was starring in it and I was determined I was going to see that play and this was like the one opportunity to go see it and this was 7:15 and I had 15 minutes to get like downtown. So I sort of asked my boyfriend to baby sit for my dog (laughing) dropped them both off at his house and just took off. And it was really nice because I could do it without feeling bad about "Oh my boyfriend has just come home and I have to stay with him" and in a sense that would have been much more convenient because I felt so tired and it would have been so nice and I was sick of driving and I had a really bad headache and it would have been really nice just to stay home except I knew this was something I wanted to do. And I it was a fantastic play. It was worth the drive. It was really, (inaudible at 12:07) was really moving. It was done really well and my friend played the lead in it and I had never seen it before and like somehow the part of me that is really alive (ph) and that I'm usually afraid to be is very much into writing and very much into acting and very much into art and those kinds of things. And I mean I was just so turned on by this play I just I drove home and it was dark and it was raining and I refused to put the radio on or anything else because I was just so happy about it and it was a really sad play but I was just really happy because it had been it was done so well and it was so meaningful and that people could express so much through art and stuff like that. And it was like then I stopped over at my boyfriends and I sort of then I really had a splitting headache and physically just and I hadn't eaten anything which is probably why I had a splitting headache all day and then I just sort of told him you know that I felt so good and I was like prepared to stay and talk for a few minutes if he felt like it or just to leave. And so he suggested that he would come over which was like a real shift because I wasn't asking him and I didn't care whether he did or not. (13:35)


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And I told him I mean it was just really a nice really a nice night. And I ended up oh another thing I had done Sunday when I got back from the walk on the lake was just to play my guitar and my recorder for like two hours and make myself learn a new song.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: Which I haven't done in ages and ages. And in a sense I got really tired of it by the time I managed to get finished with a song that I borrowed from my roommate and got it transposed to a key that I could play and copied over and typed over and the verses learned and everything else and managed to get it adapted to both recorder and guitar. But then Monday night when I came home I have this I developed this little ritual which was kind of making my home comfortable and secure when my boyfriend wasn't there and I had been doing this for like five nights to the point of like playing really beautiful records and kind of having the whole little corner next to my bed which was part of my room that I had fixed up that I was really happy about and having a (inaudible at 14:47) there's a little light on a little low table because my bed is on the floor and two candles or something like that on the other end that I could get enough light to read by a little bit or and plenty of light to write by so I'd sort of write at the opposite end of the bed and sometimes end up going to sleep down there. But really feeling on top of things when I'm cooling (ph). But anyway like last night my boyfriend was out studying in the kitchen and I was going to make him go to bed when I went to bed. I was going to try to go to bed early because I had to get up early for the family this morning and I was (inaudible at 15:27) that I was going to be awake for them. And I just sort of went in there and I was going to start writing because I felt good then I remembered that I had that song that I had learned and so I just started playing it and I managed to go through the whole thing like really well and all of a sudden I was really happy that I'd spent all that time the day before learning it. And then I put on my records that really sounded good and I wrote for like a page and a half and it was the first night in at least the last week that I haven't written anything suicidal at all I mean like even a hint of it. Usually it would just be the hint of it. It would just be a feeling it was back there. (16:11)


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: But then I also wrote about everything beautiful that had happened that day. Absolutely everything. To the rain at the airport to kind of saying hello to my roommate when I got home to kind of how happy my dog was and that I actually had time to take her into consideration. And to how good I felt playing the song and I guess the last thing I wrote was that "God I hope it lasts for just a little while". Because I just I felt in a way I felt like I don't dare feel to happy because it's all going to explode (ph).


COUNSELOR: You know it sounds like as you wrote that sort of the way that they have been all those good things unfolded and they made you feel real good but then they it also it also did make you frightened or it, the way you're talking about it sounds like its, it truly was a very special day but there's a little bit of a fragile quality about how you talk about it like I can pick up that you are not really sure or not really comfortable about just letting yourself be with that. There is some (inaudible at 17:27) concern.


PATIENT: It's just kind of the past experience of knowing that when I'm way up I tend to go way down.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And I mean something could have happened after I finished writing with my boyfriend. He could have said something that could have really gotten to me and I could have just crashed.


COUNSELOR: Given that you felt so good still it had that real precarious kind of sense for you and like you wouldn't know where it was going to come from.


PATIENT: Right. I mean I had no you know feeling of threat from any place or anything like that. I just knew that there you know anytime in the past that I started talking about beautiful things something miserable happens.


COUNSELOR: Um hum. Almost sounds like it, to start feeling that way, to start writing and that kind of thing might even have a superstitious quality for you because you know like whenever you start to settle into it or really you know settle it around you like a coat then all of a sudden someone snatches it away or something snatches it away. (18:33)


PATIENT: Maybe. In away like I've gotten so that the kind of writing that I've done all week has been like just talking off the top of my head. And barely like just because I've been writing by candlelight barely being able to see the one line I'm writing having forgotten everything that I've written before, and just sort of describing what I'm feeling right then and so as I wrote last night I had no idea that I was going to spend a page and a half listing beautiful things. It was only after I got finished that I realized what I had done and I thought "My God" and it was kind of then that I just sort of added the post script "Please let it last".


COUNSELOR: You know there's something about it. I guess I should check this out but it sounds like one of the things in addition to just the well the really like being open to things and really like beautiful things happening, working hard on a piece of music and really finishing it off, but there's a quality (ph) of how you are. You're not pushed toward somebody or pulled by something. It's like you could let that guy sit out at the table and.....


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: It really, it felt good to be able to go to bed and not be concerned about him. I'm not sure what form it might be.


PATIENT: That's so true. I mean because that's so rare for me.


COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like really........


PATIENT: Like my whole life in fact this is, what had happened the night before was all of a sudden. My whole life was upset by the fact that he was going to come the next day and should I go and pick him up and you know should I even see him again because I made all these great resolves not to see him and it ended up just like going out with him Saturday night because his sister was coming and because he wanted tickets for the winetrip (ph) that I really wanted to see. And sort of deciding well that's ok and he wanted to borrow my car that day and stuff and that he wouldn't be a threat because his sister would be there and I could just like leave the two of them together which turned out to be true and I felt really good about that and so that seeing him Saturday brought no complications at all. And in a sense I had stuck to my, in fact I even told him, I guess it was when I left here Wednesday I was starting this almost behavior modification kind of a thing of realizing every damn time that I saw my boyfriend I was upset the next day. (21:03)


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And I was thinking and now what kind of rewards can I give myself for not seeing him and for not talking to him. Now I just started thinking of a whole bunch of things like I could put a quarter in a box every day that I didn't talk to him and fifty cents in a box every day that I didn't see him and work towards something. And at that point I mean I was so dependent on him that I needed some kind of a system like that.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: To really get myself not to see him.


COUNSELOR: Yeah.


PATIENT: And I remember he called me, like this was Wednesday night, and I was just really really cold because I didn't know how to talk to him. I was (inaudible at 21:41) to talk to him. And he was just calling to say hello and he was calling to see if I wanted to go over to dinner Saturday night, this was before he knew his sister was coming. I said "I don't know. I'll just have to see when Saturday comes. And let me know when you get your plans more definite and I'll" he was going to ask somebody else over to dinner as well. And at that point I just, I really, I was really fighting to [fully committing myself to him at all] (ph).


COUNSELOR: It sounds like you really felt like you were going to have to almost physically wrench yourself away or really chomp the ties.


PATIENT: Yeah. And you know all of a sudden to find out that that wasn't really necessary. And then in a sense I've probably gone through hell making it not necessary because I have felt really bad all Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and all these great plans to not see him.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: It's fine. I didn't see him. I didn't even talk to him. I don't think I talked to him until Friday then he told me that his sister was coming in the next day or that night or something like that. And but at the same time he's, you know, he's there and I was spending all of my waking energies forgetting him.


COUNSELOR: Um hum. Yes.


PATIENT: Which is not exactly positive. (23:02)


COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. It's like the thing that popped to my mind when you started talking about putting borders in boxes was like well then we'll really have to pull in the external controls from the outside you know.


PATIENT: Um hum.


COUNSELOR: I mean you know really work at it. It wasn't, although the frame (ph) that keeps coming to my mind is that like when you're feeling good as you are, as you talk about yourself going and doing these various things, I feel like well you're choosing in a very, in a way that's very contained. It's like you choose to go out to the airport. You weren't driven by anything; you weren't ambivalent about it, you weren't, I mean there were some questions I guess, but like you weren't put into a conflict about it. You wanted to go. You wanted to see the rain on the airplane and if he was there you could pick, so it felt good to be able to pick him up and take him home and put him home.


PATIENT: Right. It really did.


COUNSELOR: It sounds like that is one of the most, at least as you say it to me, that that's one of the most important differences in the two ways of feeling. Like you were feeling that choice in you or maybe you don't feel it as choice?


PATIENT: I definitely feel it was a choice. I feel it is a real, is an ability to make choices which I often don't do.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And which I do feel is not necessarily lasting but (inaudible at 24:33)


COUNSELOR: I wanted to ask you about something that you said that struck me; I hadn't heard before. A little while back you said, I think, "When I, something about the self that I'm afraid to be. The self that's into writing, art and music and stuff." And I hadn't heard you say it quite that way before. Not about the art and the music and stuff that the business about being afraid to be that. Is that something that, is that kind of a new sense that you have or no?


PATIENT: I don't know. It's a very strange thing. It kind of dates back to my aunt being a really, really good radio commentator and an excellent writer. And I used to like take elocution lessons when I was a child and she always wanted me to be an actress because she had wanted to be and never been probably she would have been an excellent one.


COUNSELOR: Um.


PATIENT: And I did all right. You know I wasn't bad but I remember that I was always so nervous that I could never be in plays very well. 


COUNSELOR: Um.


PATIENT: I was tremendous at say learning lines and portraying a part really fast but one girl was sick one day at the day of the performance and so I was sort of, got the measles or something at the last moment and I was given the lines the night before. And I managed, because she knew that I could learn them and I could take the part and I could do a good job with it. And this is all really vague. I was like 10 years olds then or something.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And I remember I knew every line beautifully except that I got so panicked and that I really couldn't do a good job and it would kind of always happened so that eventually I got so that I hated being in plays. And I couldn't really get into a part because I was always so scared. And it wasn't just being scared of appearing before the, an audience. It was this fantastic anxiety which I imagine is in a lot of ways transmitted to me by my aunt. Like we would be in the dressing room and I knew I was a prince in Cinderella at one point and I had to wear these awful tights and this elaborate costume that I had to get into really fast after I had just gotten out of this other play. It was something, was a knot in something and I couldn't get it undone and I was practically screaming because I was so afraid we wouldn't make it in time. (27:41)


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And as far as I remember I got through the play ok but backstage I was just such a wreck.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And it kind of, I would be on my aunt's radio programs and stuff like that and it was always a withdrawn (ph) which is like whenever I'm to dances or anything like that which would happen in tea groups or something I wouldn't say a word. I mean I would just freeze. I could never think of anything to say.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And my aunt knew that I was able to express myself pretty well and yet at the same time, and especially in her presence, I really couldn't, I could never say things very well. And in a lot of ways I always let her talk because she could always express things better than I could and I could never argue back.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And so whereas I might have an ability to talk to people when I was way away from her and not on the radio or something like that. And I might have a tremendous ability to interview people which I do sometimes when I'm feeling good.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: Like interviewing somebody in psychotherapy or something like that. And which happened this morning. I was really able to talk with the family. But it's kind of more of less a phobia of being, of realizing that you know somehow if I had started early enough and stuck with it I could have been some kind of actor or an actress or some kind of a, like my uncle, my, that I, my aunt's brother that I like the most and who died this summer and whose daughter I feel most that I identify with most even though she's 10 years younger than I am. (29:42)


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: So she's very precocious. He was a TV newscaster and I would like to do something like that and he was very into and he started out as a psychologist and then went into journalism. And I guess I ended up sharing more with him than with anybody else. Whenever I'd go home when my aunt was really upset or it was saying that she was going to kill herself or something, I thought I would stay at his house or I would go to him for advice or something. And he was like the most sensitive relative that I had. And somehow this was a world that I wanted to get into. Not necessarily acting but at least being able to write and to write well and there were a couple of times in high school that I managed to produce some really, really good writings at least for a high school student and for grammar school students some really good poetry.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: But it would be rare and like I remember one poem that I wrote in seventh grade that for a seventh grader was really an excellent poem as I look back on it. It was, I had to write it for this Catholic (ph)poetry contest we had and I woke up at like 6:00 this one morning, on Saturday morning and I wrote the whole thing. It just sort of came to me and I felt so good and I still remember that morning that the sun was shining and I just felt so alive and creative which was kind of what I was writing about: God painting the colors on trees or something like that except that I was doing it in a really good way.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: In kind of the aliveness of the universe and at that time I was very religious and of course putting the last line putting God in as responsible for all of them. But somehow I just felt really a part of that great created universe when I wrote that poem. And I think more or less now it is a fear of not being able to write well combined with the fact that I haven't written well because I can't create when I'm really depressed.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: That means that I won't even try and like I would like to have tried just being in plays or something in college but I was always afraid to try out.


COUNSELOR: You know it sounds like what happened or at least what happened awhile ago was that when like you would get so far like you'd learn the lines, you'd be able to really get into a roll and portray it but just before you went onto the end stage or the end product you got dosed with a real massive bit of anxiety, and like that well I'm not sure whether you know you may a causal link between that and not wanting to try but its like somehow you never got to the part where you know where felt fulfilled or reinforced or something that really suffered a lot where you should have been going onto the fruition of it. (32:57)


PATIENT: Kind of. I mean even now like, a lot of me wants to at least, kind of a substitute would be just to be very good at English Literature, Comparative Literature or something like that.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And to be able to teach it and to really get into enough to do this at least as an avocation if not a vocation. And I end up living through I mean I almost majored in English. I got enough courses to major in it and I did a really good job in it but I ended up getting bad grades because I wouldn't turn in papers on time. But when I would get them in then I'd you know I'd really do well on them. And yet I sort of ending up just sort of living through my roommates both of whom majored in English are the two girls that I became closest to and one is getting a PhD in it now and I'm really envious of her.


COUNSELOR: Sounds like a vicarious.........


PATIENT: Yeah. Because in a sense, I mean like she's a fan.., she's an excellent student I mean and she writes very good papers and I know someday will make a very good professor which I think she wants to do she's taught English just in high school so far. And in some ways I know I'm as good as she is and I know I used to write like papers like on Joyce and particularly in this one seminar that I managed to talk the teacher into letting me take in college. He told me I was out of it but I just kept showing up and he finally let me take it. Because I know like in that I really wrote some really good papers. And she ended up asking me you know what she should write on this past year when she was taking the course on Ulysses (ph). Its like I could have told her anything about the book because I had really gotten into it.


COUNSELOR: It sounds like that must really hurt a lot. I don't if hurts the right word but like really you must have a really deep sense of maybe loss and resentment and maybe a whole bunch of things when you see yourself kind of stopped or you see somebody else at a place where you could be and maybe farther. I'm guessing about that. (35:43)


PATIENT: Somehow. Someway. I mean I don't say I could be farther because I but I think I could be a the same place she is.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: Yet I'm so far removed from it.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And I like I can't even get into a graduate school to take extra courses in it without taking GRE's (ph) in English and I can't bring myself to do that back history reading kind of stuff to take them. I feel like that just gets overwhelmed and first I have got to finish my incompletes here and that's just kind of a dream anyway and I shouldn't even try.


COUNSELOR: Just feels really impossible. Like you really are very distant from that and....


PATIENT: Its like when I can get into it like if I can go and visit this girl, the girl up in Madison .


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: For a weekend or something like that and just kind of enjoy her life. Where the two of us can get talking about literature or something like that I am just in heaven.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: Or if I can relate what I know about psychology and anthropology to literature you know just about the people and the psychology of people, the cultural kind of things or myths kinds of things, religion myths symbolism that kind of thing which I am really fascinated by not in like the Freudian sense but comes out of anthropology literature and stuff. And somehow I've got to get that integrated. Like somehow I firmly believe that there are a lot or writers that understand people a lot better than a lot of psychologists do. 


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And that understand personality and somehow I think what they're saying should be comprehended by psychologists. And I don't think they're different fields at all. And I think that a lot of the psychology ends up being a pseudo science because it won't recognize a lot of the non-quantifiable qualities of people which is what is portrayed in literature.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: Or in music or dance or (inaudible at 38:07). A lot of it is just pure emotion that you see in people going mad on psych wards but that can be just the opposite and can be really fantastic.


COUNSELOR: Sometimes I (inaudible at 38:20) a real, I don't know what to call it, what you're talking about but like I get a real organic sense about it like its really is a part of you that, and I'm guessing, like it doesn't very often get to do very much or get to get it, it doesn't very often get expressed (inaudible at 38:38).


PATIENT: Yeah well it often, I don't, when I'm really down I don't feel like expressing it. You know.

(phone ringing and counselor talking on the phone from 38:45 to 39:27)


PATIENT: That's alright. I started to say like the last time I wrote a decent poem I think it was a really, it was not professional or anything. A lot of it was kind of childish but at the same time I got a lot of meaning and a lot of levels of meaning.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: Almost like my first autumn here when I was really feeling good and was determined at that point not to let the system get me down and I remember I wrote the poem in one night when I was over at my boyfriends that at that time was just a really good friend and I was studying over there because I got really tired of the house where I was staying and there was all these little kids around. And I was supposedly reading Middle Age and Aging for a (inaudible at 40:10) course and I just decided that this stuff was so much crap. I was suppose to be writing book reports on it that I finally got written. But somehow it was just so superficial. Every single article was like, I just couldn't believe it and I would almost laugh at it. And somehow it, there was so much more real that was beyond these stupid articles that I was reading. And I was just feeling so good and so outside of this whole thing.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And at the same time I was getting articles written. I guess I had just written a critique of one of the articles and that was, I was damned if I was going to read another one and I just sat there and wrote. I mean it was like it just came in five minutes literally. And if I wrote something comparable now I could struggle for three hours or three days and not be able to write it. And I just, I remember my boyfriend was studying in the other room and I just sort of called him in and read it to him because I was so happy. Mostly because it also expressed how I was feeling which was a whole bunch of things. And it was, but it was basically like life is miserable but somehow you can come up with some kind of good thing from it.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And not quite in those words. And I haven't been (inaudible at 41:38) in a sense because I have been dragged under.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And I'd like to get on top of it.


COUNSELOR: It's like the essence of that is that you don't, really as your telling it now, that you don't work at it. I mean you might have to work at it but it's like it either comes there's the energy force.


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: The particular type of energy is there or else there's no sense in trying. If you sat down and did spend three days trying to work on anything, it wouldn't look like a poem or it wouldn't have that essential kind of essential quality that your talking about.


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: But I'm wondering to in terms of what I, there's that, when I asked to start this off, does this mean that when you get to feeling good and some of this energy and the feeling towards of the you know responding to artistic expression and things, does that also mean that it brings some fear or apprehension along with it? Or are you mostly just really feeling good about being open to that?


PATIENT: Well I have experienced it in so long I really don't know. When I do, I guess in a sense when I do feel good about it I at the same time feel bad that its not a part of my life. I mean like I'll go to the Art Institute with this same girlfriend from Madison and who also knows ten times more about art than I do just because she kind of majored in it or minored in it in college. And the two of us with there was we both love modern sculpture I think beyond anything else and there was a Bran Kusy (ph) exhibit special that we went to and I mean God we just had the most marvelous, beautiful time, the two of us there that afternoon with just going around the whole place and then going back and each of us expressing what we felt that this thing did to us and each of us learning from what the other one said. And I mean it was the last time I had been to the Art Institute and that was eight months ago.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: And in a sense I know I doubly enjoyed it because I could express myself with her, I mean that I could in someway share that artistic feeling that I felt with somebody and then that again brings me to that really strong feeling of loneliness and that somehow I can't write that so anyone can understand it and whereas I can maybe share some feelings about things with somebody but I can't do it very much and its like a once-afternoon (ph) kind of thing that happens maybe once in a while where I can get out of myself and at the same time have somebody there that feels the same way. (44:54)


COUNSELOR: It feels like your saying that in addition to being a beautiful experience in itself, it also in some way highlights or makes the pain sharper to.


PATIENT: Some. As I look back on it that's what, that's how I think of it. I'm not sure that I felt it that day.


COUNSELOR: At the time.....


PATIENT: I'm sure I felt it that night or the next morning when Nancy left.


COUNSELOR: In other words when you start to think about it.


PATIENT: Yeah or when I, when she's gone and I have to get back to writing psychological reports or something like that and, you know, then I really realize the loss. I guess that's why I have so many really downers after feeling really good.


COUNSELOR: Um hum. Because what you go back to is so much less? Is that what you meant?


PATIENT: Yeah. And because somehow its like getting a taste of a world that I really need to be a part of in some way but not being able to be a part of that world.


COUNSELOR: You know I'm like really feeling almost deprived after that or being aware of being deprived because you've had a little bit of it.


PATIENT: Um hum.


COUNSELOR: And for some reasons that you can't really change or control it's just all snatched away from you.


PATIENT: Well I see it much more as being something in me that's keeping me from reaching out and getting it.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: I mean it's like I see it, the same time a really strong potential in me to be an artist in whatever form and at the same time I see some basic flaw in me that's keeping me from ever doing this so its always going to keep me from doing this or from being this. And I guess that's what really hurts about facing me.


COUNSELOR: About facing you? Is that what you said?


PATIENT: Um hum.


COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because it sounds like your saying "God when I get right down to it, here I am looking at myself. I have to take responsibility, a large part of it for not getting where I want to go".


PATIENT: I take all of it. That's just it. I mean there are some occasions where I can blame others for my not getting someplace but by and large I can just blame myself because its my own withdrawing into myself and my own inability to reach out and do things and organize my life and direct my life in any way that's meaningful to me. That prevents anything coming about that turns out to be happy and meaningful to me. (47:44)


COUNSELOR: Now that sounds just the way, the last thing you said, sounded a little different from what I was hearing. That last part sounded like, well at first I thought you were saying something about the word flaw makes me think of like a well almost like a tragic hero if I remember (overlapping voices). It's like there's something that, you should pardon me ends up f-king it all up about the person. But then the last part sounded like you were saying something about "I am so incompetent I can't organize and direct my life".


PATIENT: When I say flaw I don't mean tragic flaw. That'd be easy to accept. I mean in a sense that would be all very heroic.


COUNSELOR: And again that's something that's kind of has that outside quality or fate or destiny quality.


PATIENT: That would be a very different kind of thing than, it's kind of having some kind of a flaw of mediocrity that prevents you from reaching out and in a sense sustaining all of mediocrity.


COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like your saying "No way can I put this on anything else. No way can I put this outside of myself." And in some ways I'm wondering if your saying "I feel stuck with the very thing I hate the most." And that that would feel very defeating to me.


PATIENT: Yeah. I mean it really does. And I mean it's like when I visited my cousin that's the one that I am most like and I can identify with tremendously and she looks up to me as a mentor in a lot of ways because I'm really the only older person that she can talk to. She can't talk to her mother because she's a real cold person. And she used to be able to talk to her father until he died this summer. And like she's going to take drama in New York this summer and she's really interested in psychology too. It's a funny combination. But its like somehow I think she's going to make it in kind of doing, she feels and I think probably wants in a lot of ways, exactly the same kind of things that I do. And I sort of look at her and I sort of see that she's somehow getting on the right road. Like she's 14 and she's trying a whole bunch of things and she's going to adult Creative Writing classes and to these drama classes because its something that she thinks she wants to do. She doesn't know but at least she's going to try. (50:35)


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: Which is something I've never done. Its something that well maybe I thought I wanted to do but I'm scared to try. And it's like I feel very, though I would never tell her, I feel very inferior next to her.


COUNSELOR: Um hum.


PATIENT: I feel somehow equal to her in being able to feel and being able to be sensitive to the same kinds of things which is why she and I can communicate so well but as far as doing anything I feel like I might as well give up because I'm not going to be able to do it or be it.


COUNSELOR: Sounds like almost you feel in someway your chances are past you. Like there, like she has these opportunities but you have some sense of not ever being able to, for having past the point where those opportunities are there for you almost.


PATIENT: It's a combination. Its not just you know "I'm too old and I should have done this when I'm young".


COUNSELOR: I didn't mean that.


PATIENT: Part of that's there because, kind of seeing her doing things now at 14 that I would like to do and yet, I mean I'm still (inaudible at 51:50) when people go, still keep telling me I look like I'm 17 and so that I'm not really over the hill yet and that there's still a lot of things that I could just start doing right now but I still can't and that's its not so much what I haven't done its what I will never be able to do. Not because I haven't done them in the past but just because whatever kept me from doing them in the past is still keeping me from doing them.


COUNSELOR: I'm sorry to cut you off. We're going to have to stop. And I also need to straighten out something. One of the secretaries put a note in my box asking for your new address and phone number I guess but she had a different name than, I thought your name was Maureen and she had Margaret. And have I been calling you the wrong thing?


PATIENT: You haven't really been calling me anything. You called me Maureen once.


COUNSELOR: And that's wrong?


PATIENT: Yeah that's wrong.


COUNSELOR: I'm very sorry. I'm very sensitive about that myself so I really feel bad about that. Is that what you like to be called, Margaret?


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: OK.


PATIENT: I'll answer to anything.


COUNSELOR: It really made me feel bad. Somehow my name is very important to me so I assume if I, that other peoples are very important to them. (53:10)


PATIENT: I guess its because I never remember other people's names that I don't get hurt at all if somebody doesn't remember mine. I can remember everything about a person except his name and to me that's more important than his name.


COUNSELOR: Tomorrow at 5:15? OK?


PATIENT: I could come any other time tomorrow. I'm having a dinner party at 6.


COUNSELOR: Ah! Good.


PATIENT: And I could come either another time tomorrow or else Friday.


COUNSELOR: Yeah I guess it will have to be sometime Friday. When would you be able to come then?


PATIENT: It would have to be after work. It would have to be like 5.


COUNSELOR: Oh wow let's see. Yeah I guess that would be ok.


PATIENT: Are you sure?


COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 54:06). OK and would you tell Vicki your new phone number and address?


PATIENT: Yeah. Sure.


COUNSELOR: OK. Thanks a lot.


PATIENT: All right. Thank you very much. I'll see you Friday.


COUNSELOR: OK.


PATIENT: And I'll try to leave work a little early so I can get here by 5.


COUNSELOR: OK. That would be helpful. Because we're going out for dinner but we wouldn't be leaving until 6 anyway. We'd be stuck on the expressway the whole time.


PATIENT: Well that's true.


COUNSELOR: So it works out perfectly.


PATIENT: It's miserable on Friday night.


COUNSELOR: Oh I know it. OK Bye-bye.(54:46)


(silence until 55:13)
