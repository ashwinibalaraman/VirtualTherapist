We moved to Canada immediately after our wedding.
When I arrived across the border with my new husband, we
entered our apartment which he had completely furnished to
his own taste--even though we were fresh from college and
broke to begin with.


As our marriage went on, I had fewer and fewer
decisions to make or was allowed to make. Money was
wasted and many feelings of hurt grew because of having to
prove “our worth” by “putting on a show.” Soon my
clothes, jewelry, linens to be put on the table, pictures to be
hung on the wall, and food to be served, etc., were all
decided for me, or approved by Michael. For headstrong and
willful me, this situation produced something short of a war!
One night we quarreled so badly, I knocked him out cold! I
had hit him in the back of the head. I found I had a fierce
kick, and thereafter my kick was my defense! We were a
“beautiful” example of a Bible college couple!


On another occasion I was forced to throw away the
cherished items I had collected from my school days. My
yearbooks, souvenirs from choir travels, old report cards--the
items of endearment which flashed memories to my mind--went
out in trash bags. As I sat on the floor of our apartment
hallway, I wept like a little girl. The hurt I felt was nonsense

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I could not adjust to my husband's city, his family, his
friends, nor his country. I learned the art of wearing an
emotional mask, so I did a lot of covering up of what I really
felt inside, in comparison to what I was portraying to other
people. Because of my inability to adjust and my inner
turmoil, it took only about nine months to a year for my
inner struggles to surface in the form of the worst case of
hives the doctor had seen. I had hives from the top of my
head to the bottom of my feet, in my mouth, in my ears,
over my eyes. The doctor became alarmed when my throat
began to close from the swelling. My body turned a
bluish-purple color, covered in large lumps. No amount of
calamine lotion would relieve the irritation. Any flareup or
excitement and one could hardly recognize it was me. All
prescription drugs failed to cure.


Not knowing the next step to take, the doctor consulted
a specialist. She came to the apartment with the message that
the specialist had told her, instead of my having a “nervous
breakdown,” my body was becoming the scapegoat. She gave
me a shot and put me to sleep for three days. When I
awakened, my skin was like a baby's. The cycle had been
broken, but I soon became a regular visitor to her and
succeeding doctors' offices with the complaint of constant,
terrible headaches.


William A. Miller mentions some very interesting observations
in his book, <i>Why Do Christians Break Down?</i> <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_3240');">[note]</a><div id="_note_3240" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">4. William A. Miller, <i>Why Do Christians Breakdown?</i>
(Augsburg Publishing House, Minneapolis, Minnesota,
1973). Used by permission.</div> He lists
four stresses in the lives of Christians (which ought not to
be): 1) What I believe I <i>ought</i> to be. 2) What others <i>expect</i>
me to be. 3) What I myself <i>want</i> to be. 4) What I, in fact, <i>am</i>.
The conflict generated by these differences may produce
tension and stress and could lead to a mental breakdown. I
had all four of these stresses working overtime inside of me
and I did not realize it. I knew I was unhappy and
disappointed in my marriage. Michael really couldn't “make”

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My head ached without relief for three years. I
awakened in the morning and my head ached. Any emotional
crisis during the day and it really pounded. I went to bed
with a headache. I took codeine, continuously, hoping it
would eventually take it away. Then Michael became alarmed
when I began to try to function with a “light head.” My
doctor suggested I should have a baby. She knew of my
frustrations and sensed my desperate need for love, and in
her way felt a baby would help fulfill that emptiness. How I
thank God that Michael refused to go along with the doctor's
suggestion.


Each one of us brings to a relationship our outlook on
life derived from good and bad experiences in our life. From
the shaping of Michael's life, I reaped ridicule in front of
people when I did not please him--which was most of the
time. My purpose in life was to serve him and make him
happy. I was to carry the full responsibilities of the home
alone (for this was a woman's role), and work at a full-time
job outside of the home. Because he was a compulsive
spender our bills were enormous. Believe me, it was constant
“nip and tuck” till payday!


He was employed at our denomination's church headquarters,
doing public relations work, so our life centered
around his entertaining and promotional work. The promotional
work was inconsistent with what we were actually
living, however. I was alone a great amount of the time; my
head hurt constantly; I felt fatigued and was always on the
verge of tears. He traveled, always had great ideas, could sell
anything and was a “beast to live with.” Yet we kept this
picture of inconsistency hidden to the outside world. In spite
of all of our Bible college training, our life together was empty.
We kept trying to fill it with things and people, but nothing

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Headaches, tears and fatigue were not the only
symptoms I had by the time we had been married a year. I
began to experience most unusual spells that I can only
describe as “horrible.” They came on me suddenly, without
warning, and the doctor didn't have a label for them.


On one occasion I was riding the streetcar home from
work, and suddenly the dizziness, weakness and nausea came
roaring at me. I shook from head to foot with the pressure
mounting in my head. By the time I got to the end of my
20-minute streetcar ride and staggered to the apartment
door, I literally fell on my hands and knees and crawled to
the bed, fully dressed, staying in bed until the spell passed
over. This 30-minute terror seemed like 30 years. These spells
lasted for years, until after my breakdown. When I began to
“come together” inside, they left and have never returned.


I took several tests at the hospital for these symptoms,
but it appears they were one of those “oddities” of mental
illness and its reactions.


Every time Michael prepared to leave for a trip, we had
a severe quarrel. In between times, we quarreled constantly.
There were times when he locked me in a room for “being
naughty.” On more than one occasion he stated that he
would have me locked up in the Provincial Mental Hospital--
that I was a terror to live with. He told me I was crazy, and
he let me know what he thought in no uncertain terms.
Medical bills began to pile very high in my search for a doctor
who might be able to help me in my agony. I felt “sick” most
of the time, I was a “touchy” employee at work, and a poor
wife at home. One doctor I visited told me my husband was
snuffing out my personality. Even though in my distorted
way I tried to please him, Michael let me know I never
measured up. He was always ashamed of me.


As Michael's trips increased, another problem was added

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

While he was away on a three-week trip, I stayed with
friends for one night. They were up all night with me till
5:30 in the morning, trying to help me rationalize my fear of
Satan. However, a fear this large, and so long with a person,
cannot be rationalized. It has to be dealt with by the
supernatural power of God. People are weak without the
power of God in their lives. As much as my friends wanted to
help me, they couldn't. I did not go to work the following
day; I tried to conquer the fear by myself.


During this same trip I spent two days with my pastor
and his wife. One night I was awakened by a nightmare. A
huge snake was coming at me and I could not get away. I
woke up completely terrorized by fear. I couldn't understand
why I should be having a nightmare in my pastor's home, for
I was not alone. I did not tell anyone about the dream,
because no one seemed to understand the enormous problem
within me. They didn't have any answers, and neither did I,
so I continued being petrified to be alone and afraid to tell
anyone about my silly fears. I felt like crying most of the
time. I felt deeply alone.


During this disastrous four-year marriage, I was told as a
Christian wife I should submit to my husband; make him
happy, and he in turn would (from his happiness) be good to
me. I continued to feel guilty because this didn't seem to
work in my home, even though I tried very hard.


No one understood Michael had a sick mind. Nor was it
understood he also was to be open to letting God deal with
him, and that <i>only</i> as his relationship to Christ was in order,
would there be any hope for us. I heard nothing about his
being required to love me as Christ loves the Church; and
because Christ loves the Church, He literally spilled His blood
and His insides for it. A man really loving his wife, through
Christ's example, will find out it will cost him just about

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Only as a man first submits to Christ can he then love
his wife as God wants him to. He will literally give ALL of
himself for her. What wife, unless she is out of her mind,
wouldn't respond to a man and from that response a love
would grow and she would want to make him happy? In our
home, the order was reversed. I was giving everything I was
capable of, as distorted as it was, to a very distorted and sick
man.


As our marriage began to crumble apart, our doctor
tried to talk with Michael, as did our pastor. But in his eyes,
he had no problems. I was the one who was unbalanced. He
later confessed to me that he wasn't overjoyed when we were
married, but he hoped I would change. And so he set out to
change me into his mold. I was breaking underneath the
strain. He was unhappy and our so-called “ministry to the
church” was in actuality a farce.


The word “submission” and the teaching of this
principle left such a terrible taste in my spiritual mouth, that
later on the Lord Jesus really had to deal with me in this area
of hurt and I had to return to the pain once again, but I was
healed from the scars. Spiritual healing sometimes does hurt,
but the rewards, Praise be to God, are greater than the
sacrifice of pain.


Added to our knock down, drag out fights, we had
financial problems! We were in debt over our heads. But in
order to go on with one another we spent like crazy ...
impressing people and trying to cover over our own misery. I
had a routine with my paycheck: As usual, it was always <i>me</i>
who had to rush <i>my</i> paycheck to <i>his</i> bank, on the other side
of town via several streetcars, so the checks he had written
wouldn't bounce.


Eventually I gave up what seemed to me to be a battle I
was fighting alone to live up to what we knew then as

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In trying to find a way out of an impossible situation I
was told very clearly I could get a divorce, because I was
being treated cruelly, but I could never remarry or I would
lose my salvation.


Now, as I go into this area of divorce, I am putting this
as delicately as I know how. I am not advocating divorce for
all sick marriages; however, in the healing that God has taken
me through and the studying I have done, I do believe if I
had remained married to Michael, I would have been
permanently committed to a psychiatric institution, or for
constant periodic admittances, <i>or</i> eventually have ended my
life or his. The environment was poisonous to my system.
God in His mercy understands the hearts <i>and minds</i> of all
involved, and the future outcome. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_13573');">[note]</a><div id="_note_13573" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">5. C.S. Lovett, <i>The Divorce Problem</i> (Personal Christianity,
Baldwin Park, California, 1964).Also, Helen Kooiman Hosier, <i>The Other Side of Divorce</i>
(Hawthorn Books, Inc., W. Clement Stone, Publisher,
New York, 1975.)</div>


I recently heard of some persons who were told if they
divorced, God would forever put them on the shelf and never
use them again! What bondage and tragedy we bring on one
another, to judge so severely!


As I approached what seemed to me the black abyss of a
divorce situation, I went through one of the deepest spiritual
crises of my life and experienced a 98 percent rejection by
everyone I knew.


I did not hear, nor did I see, the marvelous transforming
and energizing power of the Holy Spirit at work in people's
lives. If it was around, I was turned off. It appeared to my
distorted mind that God couldn't or wouldn't help me--there
was my fear of Satan. There were His so-called followers,
whom we had ministered to over the years, who lacked love
for other fellow believers and our family had received
many of their stinging arrows--and now He was requiring
me to stay on and live in agony, with very destructive
thoughts now entering my head! How could God be so
cruel to me?

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All I could see was God taking me into blackness.
Requiring me to “just exist” the rest of my life.


I went around explaining to friends, and sometimes to
relatives, asking them to please understand--almost asking for
their permission to get out of my mess. I longed for
compassion. I didn't find it in people nor did I find it in
“God.” (People are God's representatives, and they left me
cold.)


During this time that I felt I was “dangling on the scales
of life,” I met David, a co-worker of Michael's, who was a
“dream walking on two feet.” By this time in our marriage,
we were moving in a more liberal church environment and
many standards were different from what I had been
accustomed to. Movies were no longer sin; the pastor of the
church had a swing/jazz group with the young people and
they played for the teens' dances. Church members drank,
danced and smoked, etc. They did all of the things we as a
couple had been taught were wrong. We moved over into the
“comfortableness” of this church environment which appeared
would provide some relief from the boredom of life.
Little did I realize that all that I was taking in, heaped upon a
foundation of nothing, would help to destroy me. I had no
armor with which to fight.


At this point I believe it is important to explain to you a
psychiatric analysis from Dr. W. Earl Biddle's book, <i>The
Integration of Religion and Psychiatry</i>. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_16469');">[note]</a><div id="_note_16469" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">6. W. Earl Biddle, M.D., F.A.P.A., <i>The Integration of

“In the search for cosmic security, some people undergo
a profound emotional struggle. The concept of a wrathful
God who cannot be approached, the lack of material
necessities, or the tenuous support of personal relations with
others makes it very difficult to achieve a feeling of
satisfaction and security. Some of those who have surmounted
a serious spiritual crisis have become great mystics.
Many of those who have failed have become psychotic. There
is a basic religious element underlying all neurotic and
psychotic disorders, though it is not very obvious. By nature

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was not average, I was alone without support for many
reasons, and I moved over from the state of neurosis to
psychosis.


My first psychiatrist told me recently, while doing
research for this book, that in his opinion I had been
mentally ill for 15 years prior to what I pinpoint as “my
breakdown.” The Holy Spirit of God told me, through one
of His servants one evening, that I had battled a chaotic and
neurotic condition for 17 years. And in His diplomacy with
which He always speaks, He said He had brought me under a
<i>sound mind</i>. (What greater comfort and security can a former
mental patient have than to hear and know that <i>God has</i>
brought him to sanity and he is now sound! God sees him as
sound!)


What I have told you of a psychic crisis became a reality
in my life. My future conduct then became a reflection of
what I actually was inside--complete disorder.


One evening, my husband's co-worker, and now my
“dream man,” looked into my eyes, and in that look was a
message for me. I was unaware my husband spotted this
incident and he used the situation for all it was worth, and it
was worth a lot. He plotted and maneuvered; threw us
together all he could. This was his strategy, he later confessed
to me, because he wanted out of the marriage and used David
as the way. Because of the complete situation and circumstances,
a <i>very wrong</i> relationship was established between
David and me.


It was also about this time that in my confusion to heal

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I began to receive looks of raised eyebrows. Invitations
to sing in church stopped. I couldn't look pretty and be
spiritual too. At this point I was no longer running a spiritual
race. I really didn't care what people thought anymore,
including members of my family and those in church. I had
failed at pleasing everyone else, so now I was going to please
me!


Unconsciously I raised my resentment banner higher
and higher. What pleased David who accepted me was
all-important. I hadn't been able to make the relationship
with my former fiance, Jimmy, work, or with my husband, or
the church, so I began to do my own thing.


After a year or so of living a double life, I became
panicky. I knew I was throwing away my new home (by this
time we had a new house, whether or not we could afford it),
its contents (all the rest of my physical things had been given
away in many moves in life or because my husband decided I
didn't need them), and the things that were part of my
present identity, even though I never picked them out, I had
taken good care of them. I was throwing away my reputation,
my family and relationships with church friends. The
only thing I wasn't losing was my secretarial job.


Living a double life leads to deterioration, in many areas
of the person's life, very fast, whether or not one realizes it.


In the panic of seeing all my security swept away, I tried
to resolve our marriage problems. I approached my husband
about making a new start. The terrible reaction I received I
have reserved not to include in this writing. So, I clung to
whatever approval I received from David and traveled farther
and farther into rebellion and resentment.

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The extreme sadness of all this mess was that he was a
believer and a leader in Christian circles. He was also
prominent, and his life, with his inability to resolve his own
marital problems, scarred many other lives including his own
family. When we transgress the laws of God, we don't pay the
price alone. We drag others down with us. The reaping of our
sown seeds follows us for years, sometimes leaving irreparable
damage, unless God intervenes.


Here we were two couples, leaders in the Christian
church, and the gospel we ministered had not taken hold in
our own lives. All of us needed to have a profound encounter
with Jesus Christ, and much damage was done to His sheep
because of our distorted, rebellious, resentful lives.


After my husband's drastic reaction to my pleas for
marital unity, my pastor and his wife helped me move what
contents I salvaged from our home into an apartment.


My pastor was on the board of directors for a
denominational home for unwed mothers. I, too, had been
appointed to that board. One evening while he was speaking
to the local pastors of the area, telling them of the home's
ministry, I heard him quote a verse from the Bible which
years later became a thread of life for me to hang on to.
Walter was telling about the lives of many girls who were
being transformed when they accepted Jesus, and how Christ
helped them by erasing the guilt on their heart when they
confessed Him as Lord and Saviour and repented of their
acts, regardless of the motives. He witnessed to the transformation
of many girls' lives when they turned the
brokenness of their lives over to Him, by quoting, “A bruised
reed will He not break” (Isa. 42:3, NASB). I was feeling very
bruised inside, but unwilling to cling to Him, so I left the
meeting, resigned from the board, and continued on my
way.


I tried to keep my life hidden from my family as much
as possible during this time. My letters said very little, and
my visits were few. I had no idea of what a “mother heart”
was. In staggering through life, unwilling to listen, I became

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went through my divorce alone, with only David
beside me. It was us, against the “whole world.” I was going
to have him regardless of what I had to do, or whomever I
had to hurt in order to win. I was fooling myself into
believing I could make a relationship with him work. There
was one point of time that reality tried to filter in. Just prior
to the breaking up of our home, I was lying in bed one night
weeping. In the darkness I said to my husband, “I guess I
have just reached out on a limb for a star, and that limb has
broken.” He did not answer me in any way but with silence.


There have been crisis-times in my mother's life when
the Lord has given her visions. I was frightened He would give
her a vision of my life-style. Each time I received a letter
from her, I became sick to my stomach and trembled.
Mothers have a sixth sense about their children, but I hated
my mother for having this. I wanted to be free of her and of
everyone else who tried to restrain me from doing my own
thing. To me the whole world was wrong and I was right. I
had been hurt beyond all words, so I felt justified in my
actions.


As madly in love as I thought I was with David, I longed
very much to look up my former fiance, Jimmy. I had never
stopped thinking of him, and had constantly dreamed about
him when I was married. I was “crazy” about my present
man, but my ego wanted another one, too! Via the grapevine
I heard my chances of getting reacquainted with him was
absolutely out. I was a divorcee.


David and I moved from the world of Christianity over
into the world where we were accepted, the society of
divorced people and those who wanted nothing to do with
God. I do want to say that I wept many, many bitter tears
with no one to tell how I really felt inside, but I couldn't go
back. The door was shut and I had to make the best of it.


In trying to make my new life-style work, the first thing

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In my office at work, I was one of the best-dressed and
best-looking women there. My supreme effort was to make as
many heads turn as I could. I concentrated on my secretarial
skills and became a dependable and valuable employee. I
made friendly relationships with all the men in my office,
including my boss, and was invited to all the parties. Our
office was one “constant good time” from when we arrived
at work in the morning until we left at night. Everything the
other employees did, I did. They liked me. I liked them. I
endeavored to be popular and I was because I had seared my
conscience. I was free, but little did I realize I was in bondage
to a cycle of running and not facing up to realistic situations.
As long as I could run, I was OK. Anyone who tried to get
me to stop long enough to really consider and face an issue
did not have my time and attention.


I had never really had a sense of humor before, but I
found out things were hilariously funny when I was drinking.
When I shed my legal and spiritual environment I began to
experience laughter, even though it was on an artificial plane.
When I began to do research for this book, and I contacted
my first psychiatrist to learn some history for the period of
time due to memory loss, he exclaimed: “Pat, I can't get over
the sense of humor you have! When you were my patient,
you just couldn't see anything funny in life, and now you can
laugh and see humor in life's situations! This really speaks
how you have changed!”


In the mire that I lived in, my only defense (and I
actually did this) was to tell God, “Bug off. If I really do
believe in You, and You really do love me, someday when I
am finished having a good time, I'll look You up, and You'll

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004132431-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thinking if David and I really paid a high price for one
another, it meant we really loved one another and would live
happily ever after--on our conditions and terms, of course.
But our deceptiveness was so ingrained within us we became
deceptive one with another. Trouble set in. The glamor began
to wear off, and <i>we</i> quarreled! We had brought to our
relationship nothing but ashes inside of us and so we had
nothing to give one another, only what we could get out of
one another. But, I could not stand losing him. To protect
myself I had other men friends on the side--at a distance, but
there anyway, just in case. If this man deflated my ego, I
would have others to build it up!


After several months, with our relationship going up and
down, I tried to push him into a commitment to me; he was
too handsome to lose. But I was miserable.


One night out of desperation, as I began to see I was fast
deteriorating even in my own self-respect, I cried and prayed
for the first time in a long, long time, “Oh God, help me.” I
had nearly given up my belief in Him. He meant authority
and I did not want authority. I had even managed to
maneuver authority out of my boss's relationship with me. I
was steering clear from anyone who meant a “no” to me, but
out of desperation I turned to the one who was Supreme
Authority, badly needing someone to take control of an
uncontrollable situation. I had no proper direction of my
will. I could be talked into just about anything. Others--my
peers--controlled my life.


God heard that desperate cry. Some old college friends
living in California came to my mind. I looked them up and
decided to take my vacation in the Land of Sunshine, which
is supposed to cure all ills. I never dreamed I took the ills
inside of me wherever I went.


I fell in love with “care-free” living in California during

For the next 10 months I did everything I could to
convince him we had to do this. I reasoned: We had too
much against us where we were, and if we went to a place
where we were unknown, we would be accepted. We could
both use our music once again. No one minded out in
California, it was life at its easiest, and we could cover up
parts of our life that we didn't want exposed anymore.


After many quarrels and threats I carried out my biggest
threat, and I quickly (as my habit pattern was) made a
change. All of my belongings were either packed or sold to
others who could use them. I told David if he loved me, he'd
have to pull up his stakes and follow me. I resigned my job
and said my good-byes. My boss told me he would look me
up on his trips West. I eagerly anticipated a new, exciting life
on the West Coast.


As David and I drove over the United States border, a
tremendous peace came over me that I was doing the right
thing. This flashing sense of peace was the first momentary
peace I had felt in years. It went as quickly as it came, but it
was real, and this registered with me. I KNEW going to
California was what I should do. My rationales were all mixed
up, but the basic issue of moving to California was right, as I
later learned.


We drove up in front of my parents' home; he leaned
over to kiss me, leaving me with one promise, “I'll be out
West to join you, doll, in two months.” I believed him. With
anticipated new hope in our escape from consequences, I
flew by plane from my parents' home to a new life in
California. I could hardly wait until David would make his
move to be with me.

The following two months were the loneliest and
longest I had spent in a long time. I found a job, bought a
car, and settled into an apartment. David flew out on his
birthday, and I was led to believe he was getting his life in
order back in Canada to make a permanent change so we
could be married. To my surprise David said he did not
intend to stay. He had given up everything and everyone so
far, but he couldn't go a step farther. He would not be
joining me. Moving to a tolerable environment would not
work, nor help in any way. The problems were in us.


I did not learn of his plans until the morning he flew
back to his home. When he broke the news to me, my life
came apart. I kept hoping all the way to the airport he would
change his mind, but he didn't.


Standing in the Continental Airlines building at Los
Angeles International Airport, his parting words pierced my
heart. With tears rolling down his handsome face, David
spoke very brokenly, “I'm sorry, doll.” He turned and
walked on to the plane.


I wept. While trying to see my way through uncontrollable
tears, over the loud speaker I heard the song played
that had been our song, the song that had touched our hearts
as it had described our relationship. We had called it “our
song.” Now the timing was perfect. He was gone. I had no
one. I wanted to die. The one I loved more than God had
rejected me finally. While the speaker continued to play
“Fascination,” I could only reason, “It must have been <i>just</i>
fascination for him.”


I had lost Jimmy, and my husband, but losing him,
having him walk away from me when we had been through so
much together and had fought off so many people and
circumstances, was unbearable.


After that day in 1963, I never saw him again and I was
not to be the same person thereafter. I felt I could never love
again.


How I ever drove back to Pasadena is a miracle to me. I

My grief was more than I could handle, so I went
straight to the church office of my California Bible college
friend and poured out to him my whole disastrous mess. In
his wise ministerial way he spoke to me in love and
compassion. He was also wise in helping me to find a medical
doctor who gave me medication to give me a will to live. (My
pastor-friend later had the joy of marrying my beloved
husband and me.)


After I returned to my apartment from the doctor that
night, I knelt in devastation before God. I knew He had
stopped me dead in my tracks. I felt like a lost, tired little girl
desperately wanting to lay her head in the lap of Jesus to
receive some sort of comfort and forgiveness.


I asked God that night to help me find some reason to
live, because I felt so alone. If He would, I would never again
leave Him out of my life.


To find some strength for living, I tried to resurrect my
old faith, even if it was distorted. I began to attend the
church where my college friends ministered, and joined the
choir. One Sunday morning, the Lord used a particular song
to speak very profoundly to me. The words were:


O Love that wilt not let me go,<br />
I rest my weary soul in Thee.<br />
I give Thee back the life I owe,<br />
That in Thine ocean depths its flow<br />
May richer, fuller be.


O Joy that seekest me through pain,<br />
I cannot close my heart to Thee;<br />
I trace the rainbow thru the rain,<br />
And feel the promise is not vain<br />
That morn shall tearless be.

O Cross that liftest up my head,<br />
I dare not ask to fly from Thee;<br />
I lay in dust life's glory dead,<br />
And from the ground there blossoms red<br />
Life that shall endless be.


--George Matheson/Albert L. Peace


I knew I was weary, running from God, and somehow
through the pain I was living in and from the dust of my life
He could bring good from it. Only I did not know how. I
only knew from the song I dare not close my heart to Him
any longer.


People who have good mental health, that is a healthy
outlook on life, have a proper sense of self-worth. They like
themselves; they respect the body and mind given them by
God, and they will not allow other people to destroy
them.


I have learned the past few years that when a person, as
it were, “trips off and does his own thing,” hurting himself as
well as others, is not only spiritually sick, he is mentally sick.
Sometimes this intertwining of both sicknesses is hard to
unravel. Responsible behavior does not throw everything and
everybody to the four winds, regardless of who is hurt.
Trying to live unrealistically speaks of not being able to face
up to responsibility.


I believe there are two fundamental points in the area of
Christians and mental illness. People do not set out to make
their own lives miserable, hurting themselves and others; they
inadvertently do this because of twisted thinking and a lack
of transformation of their spirit by the Spirit of God. The
empowering of the Holy Spirit has been left out. Because the
Church has put God, moving and working by His Spirit, in a
box, this tremendous energy for living a balanced life has
been denied the believer for over many, many years. My
personal belief (barring the illness is not of an organic nature)
why so many Christians have become mentally ill is because
there needs to be a definite time in the believer's life when

Just the other day I read a good explanation of the
makeup of man by McCandlish Phillips in his book, <i>The
Bible, the Supernatural and the Jews</i>. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_39677');">[note]</a><div id="_note_39677" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">7. McCandlish Phillips, <i>The Bible, the Supernatural and the
Jews</i> (Copyright 1970 by McCandlish Phillips. Used with
permission of the World Publishing Company, Publisher).</div> I am taking a few
excerpts from his book to make it clear to you what I'am
trying to say.


“In God's perfect design for man, the human spirit,
indwelt and filled by the Holy Spirit and enjoying a full and
free communion with the living God, was to govern all the
activities and power of the soul--intellect, will and emotions.
In this plan, man would always act in perfect agreement with
the will of his Creator and he would enjoy the fruits of the
creation in abundant leisure and in peace.... The human
spirit and the Holy Spirit wholly at one--would jointly rule
with God outward from the spirit, through the soul and body
to the whole natural environment. Everywhere man went,
then, the will of God would be done.


“It is the spirit of man, not the soul, that God intended
to govern his life! The soul is not capable of governing the
life aright. With the soul in charge, the center of man's
government is misplaced from God to self. He is governed by
his soul. Just as confusion besets the body politic when the
lines of command are disoriented, confusion has plagued
human affairs because of this dislocation.


“An individual may be primarily or highly developed in
any of the three parts of his being: body, soul, or spirit. Or
he may be underdeveloped in one or more of these. He may
be badly lopsided, as some are.


“God intended the balanced development of man in all
three sectors, with none to be developed at the expense of
another.”

By this definition, I was lopsided in the soul of my
being. My mind, will and emotions were out of whack. I was
underdeveloped in the spirit ... a baby ... so my sick soul
led my life and it was a far cry from what He has now made
it, and intended it to be.
