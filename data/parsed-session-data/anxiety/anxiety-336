<font size="4"><b>Chapter 17: Insomnia</b></font>
<b>Description of the Disorder</b>
[p. <i>349</i>]

Insomnia poses significant health, safety,
and economic burdens for both afflicted
employees and their employers. Compared
to good sleepers, employees who suffer
from chronic insomnia have higher rates
of tardiness, take more sick leave, visit
health care practitioners more often, and
exhibit decreased productivity and inhibited
advancement. Insomniacs whose jobs
require them to drive or operate machinery
are at greater risk for on-the-job accidents.
The potential impact of insomnia on the
workplace is staggering when one considers
that estimates of the number of individuals
experiencing sleep problems ranges from
13% to 52% of the general population of
developed countries. Fortunately, for
employers and employees alike, effective
and relatively inexpensive treatments are
available. Sleep medications (both over-the-counter
and prescription) are currently the
most popular form of treatment. In this
chapter, however, we discuss the reasons we
recommend psychological interventions
over medication (e.g., better long-term relief
of symptoms, more cost-effective in the long
run). In our review of the impact of insomnia
on the workplace, we place particular
emphasis on work-related factors that may
contribute to poor sleep as well as ways in
which employers can facilitate appropriate
diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for
employees plagued by poor sleep.


Although there is no consensus definition,
most insomnia researchers and clinicians
agree that insomnia is the inability to
obtain adequate sleep because of retarded
sleep onset, frequent arousals, and/or early-morning
awakening (Bootzin &amp; Nicassio,
1978). This definition may seem vague, but
nonetheless encompasses two important
elements. First, it rules out the occasional
problems that even good sleepers may
experience and instead emphasizes frequent
and recurring difficulties in obtaining sufficient
sleep. Second, by incorporating the
word "adequate," it stresses the subjective
nature of the problem. This is an important

[p. <i>350</i>]

Generally, people with insomnia (PWI)
are divided into groups based on the time of
night they experience an inability to sleep.
On the basis of this classification system,
three major types of insomnia have been
observed: (a) sleep onset insomnia, or difficulty
in falling asleep; (b) sleep maintenance
insomnia, or interrupted sleep characterized
by frequent nighttime awakenings; and
(c) terminal insomnia, or early-morning
awakenings coupled with an inability to
return to sleep. These symptoms may occur
singly or in combination.


Insomnia is defined explicitly in three
diagnostic systems. Because only one of
these manuals is used regularly in the mental
health field, we will restrict our discussion
to this manual, the <i>Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition</i> (<i>DSM-IV</i>) (American
Psychiatric Association, 1994). The <i>DSM-IV</i>
has a broad classification system that
recognizes four main types of sleep disorders:
sleep disorders related to another mental
disorder, sleep disorders resulting from a
general medical condition, substance-induced
sleep disorders, and primary sleep
disorders (which includes insomnia). The
diagnostic features of insomnia in the <i>DSM-IV</i>
include a persistent (i.e., for at least 1
month) complaint of difficulty initiating or
maintaining sleep that causes significant
distress and is associated with impaired
social or occupational functioning.

<b>Epidemiology</b>

Insomnia is among the most frequent health
complaints brought to the attention of
health care providers (Morin, Culbert, &amp;
Schwartz, 1994). Depending upon the exact
question and the time frame involved, sleep
disorders in general are reported by 13% to
52% of community respondents (e.g.,
Bixler, Kales, Soldatos, Kales, &amp; Healey,
1979; Gallup Organization, 1995; Karacan,
Thornby, &amp; Anch, 1976). Some of the variability
in these estimates is due to the types
of questions asked. Survey questions have
included the following: "How often do you
have trouble sleeping?" "Would you please
look at this card and tell me if you have any
of these sleep problems now?" "Has trouble
falling asleep or trouble staying asleep bothered
you in the past 12 months?" None of
these surveys differentiated insomnia occurring
once or twice a month from nightly or
nearly nightly insomnia, nor did any of
them assess the duration of the sleep difficulties.
Two epidemiological surveys that
addressed these issues suggest that 10% to
15% of adults complain of chronic insomnia
(Ford &amp; Kamerow, 1989; Mellinger,
Balter, &amp; Uhlenhuth, 1985).


Both being female and aging are associated
with increased rates of reported sleep
difficulty. Virtually all of the investigations
cited above indicate that women are about
1.3 times more likely to report insomnia-like
sleep problems than men, with the
notable exception of 20- to 40-year-old
women (no gender differences). Studies that
include wide age ranges find that the elderly
(defined here as greater than 65 years old)
generally have an approximately 1.5 times
higher prevalence rate of sleep disturbance

[p. <i>351</i>]

Insomnia has significant economic and
social consequences. One recent study estimated
that the direct cost of insomnia
(defined as the cost of medical care or self-treatment
borne by patients, organized
health care providers, insurance providers,
or the government) in the United States was
$13.6 billion in 1995 (Walsh &amp; Ustin,
1999). A separate study estimated the indirect
costs associated with insomnia, including
estimated monetary values for decreased
productivity at work, health and property
costs related to accidents, and medical costs
associated with comorbid conditions, to be
between $77.05 billion and $92.13 billion a
year (Stoller, 1994).


<b><i>Insomnia and the Workplace</i></b>


Insomnia is not a benign problem
because it can adversely affect a person's life
by causing substantial psychosocial, occupational,
health, and economic repercussions
(Morin et al., 1994). These difficulties
are the mechanism through which insomnia
plays an important role in affecting the
workplace and reducing workplace productivity.
Individuals with chronic sleep
disturbances experience more psychological
distress, report greater impairments of
daytime functioning, take more sick leave,
are more preoccupied with somatic problems,
and utilize health care resources more
often than do good sleepers (Ford &amp;
Kamerow, 1989; Gallup Organization,
1995; Mellinger et al., 1985). In one study,
27% of a random community sample
reported that their daytime functioning was
negatively affected by poor sleep at least
twice a week (Addison, Thorpy, Roehrs, &amp;
Roth, 1991). For those individuals in this
sample who were dissatisfied with their
sleep, this percentage increased to 70%. A
Gallup study (Gallup Organization, 1995)
found that PWI report poor performance at
work, memory difficulties, concentration
problems, and twice as many fatigue-related
automobile accidents as compared to good
sleepers. Perhaps the best study examining
sleep disturbance's relationship to job performance
was done with U.S. Navy personnel.
In this longitudinal study, poor sleepers
earned fewer promotions, remained at
lower pay grades, and received fewer recommendations
for reenlistment than did
their good-sleeping peers (Johnson &amp;
Spinweber, 1983).


Although none of these chronic insomnia
studies allows for a conclusion of causality,
poor sleep and impaired daytime
functioning are clearly related. More importantly
to employers, daytime impairments
discussed previously can negatively influence
on-the-job performance by significantly
reducing job productivity and by decreasing
the number of workdays of their poor-sleeping
employees. Indeed, a community survey
of adults found that people reporting poor
sleep at least seven nights a month (which
represents minimal diagnostic criteria
for insomnia) missed 5.2 more days of work
per year than did people reporting good
sleep (Schweitzer, Engelhardt, Hilliker,
Muehlbach, &amp; Walsh, 1992). These poor
sleepers also estimated three times as many
days of reduced productivity at work as
those with no sleep difficulty. In summary,
epidemiological evidence suggests that
insomnia can have a profound effect on the
workplace, reducing the ability of affected
employees to maintain adequate productivity
and safety on the job, while simultaneously
impairing their overall quality of life.

<b>Assessment</b>
[p. <i>352</i>]

When a person complains of difficulty
sleeping, a thorough investigation of this
complaint is warranted. The key ingredient
in conducting an assessment of sleep difficulties
is to gather a sleep history. A detailed
sleep history gives the interviewer insight
into the nature, severity, and duration of
the problem. We will discuss two methods
of obtaining sleep information, with an
emphasis on the subjective report of the
individual, because this is crucial in the
diagnosis of insomnia. These two methods
are commonly used together and provide
enough information for an adequate diagnosis
when used appropriately.


<b><i>Sleep Interview</i></b>


Sleep interviews are a method of ascertaining
the history of the sleep problem and
are the most commonly used method of sleep
assessment. A suggested format for a sleep
history interview is presented in Table 17.1.
This semistructured approach allows the
interviewer to begin questioning on general
issues, while providing more specific queries
when necessary.


Several measures can be used to assist
the sleep interview. For example, the
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Buysse
et al., 1991) can be used to screen for other
sleep difficulties and to guide the sleep interview.
This measure is a quick index (it takes
approximately 10 minutes to complete) that
gathers data on typical sleep during the
previous month and includes several items
that are helpful in screening out other sleep
disorders.


<b><i>Sleep Diaries</i></b>


Sleep diaries are invaluable in the
appraisal of sleep disturbance and the
evaluation of treatment outcome. Whereas
the sleep interview provides an essential
retrospective overview, sleep diaries yield
night-by-night information on perceptions
of sleep pattern and quality, and may be
obtained over many weeks. Thus, sleep
diaries have become the staple of sleep
assessment and have been used extensively
both clinically and in research. These diaries
typically assess a number of factors, including
time to sleep onset, number and duration
of nighttime awakenings, total sleep
time, and perceived quality of sleep. Sleep
diaries should be completed for a minimum
of 2 weeks in order to ensure adequate stability
of the sleep data (Wohlgemuth,
Edinger, Fins, &amp; Sullivan, 1999). An example
of standard sleep diaries is presented in
Figure 17.1.


<b><i>Exclusion Criteria</i></b>


To ensure that the sleep complaint is
insomnia, several important exclusionary
criteria should be addressed. Assessment
criteria discussed previously assume that
insomnia secondary to other problems has
been excluded. Examples of secondary
insomnia sources are a mental disorder
(e.g., major depressive disorder, generalized
anxiety disorder); a general medical condition
(e.g., hyperthyroidism, cancer); the
physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
chemotherapy, abuse of drugs); or another
sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea, periodic
limb movement syndrome, narcolepsy).


Determining the primary or secondary
status of an insomnia complaint has important
implications for treatment and safety.
For example, ruling out sleep apnea (a disorder
characterized by excessive daytime
sleepiness due to numerous nighttime awakenings)
is crucial for people employed in
occupations where severe daytime sleepiness
is hazardous (e.g., truck drivers, crane

<b>Clinical Picture</b>

Typical functional losses include reports of
poor work performance, memory problems,
and impaired concentration (see our earlier
section on Epidemiology for a more thorough
discussion of these losses). The case
study below provides a good example of the
typical clinical presentation of insomnia
and how it affects the workplace.


<b><i>Case Description</i></b>


John is a 35-year-old, married African
American male who has been employed
for 15 years in a shipping company. John's
complaint is a familiar one. Despite his best
efforts, which include avoiding naps during
the day, limiting caffeine consumption
in the afternoon, and reading nonstimulating
material at bedtime, he cannot get to
sleep in less than an hour. Approximately
once a week, it takes John 3 or more hours
to get to sleep.


John's job requires him to be constantly
at peak performance. He regularly operates
a forklift and a freight loader in performing
his duties as shipping coordinator. The
skills necessary to operate this equipment
often require him to maintain concentration
and attention for extended periods of time
to maximize both productivity and personal
safety. John has been worried about the
potential consequences of his sleep difficulties
at work for the past few months, because
his insomnia problems have gotten worse
during this time. John complains of having
difficulty concentrating during the day,
particularly when he does not drink enough
coffee in the morning. Furthermore, he
regularly feels fatigued and often lacks the
energy necessary to move and load boxes
in a timely manner. John's supervisor has
commented on several occasions that his
productivity is not where it used to be, and
that he will have to formally discipline him
if he cannot perform up to par.


In addition to his on-the-job difficulties,
John has had to take several days off from
work in the past few months. He calls in
sick after nights when he is unable to get
more than 2 or 3 hours of sleep, because he
feels unable to perform with so little sleep.
John was recently reprimanded for his frequent
use of sick leave, and this formal
reprimand will inhibit him from future
upward mobility in the company.


In order to cope with his sleep onset difficulties,
John has recently begun drinking
one or two beers before bedtime and taking
over-the-counter sleep medication to help
him get to sleep. He is concerned about this,
because he has used medication for only a
short amount of time and has already had
to increase the dose of the medication in
order to get to sleep. His concerns notwithstanding,
John is determined to get a good
night's sleep and is willing to do whatever it
takes to accomplish this goal. A recent car
accident one morning after an insomnia
night (he dozed off and ran a red light)
prompted him to seek behavioral treatment
for his insomnia difficulties.

<b>Precipitating Conditions</b>

Several different conditions may precipitate
the onset of insomnia. Depression, for

[p. <i>356</i>]

In a similar vein, previous epidemiological
research found that the complaint of
insomnia tends to accompany many symptoms
that are consistent with anxiety (Bixler
et al., 1979; Karacan et al., 1976; Mellinger
et al., 1985). Ford and Kamerow (1989)
also found increased rates of developing
anxiety disorders in individuals with persistent
insomnia. Overall, numerous studies
examining mood in PWI have found consistently
elevated depression and anxiety,
albeit at a subclinical level. PWI are generally
characterized by a clinical picture of
a mildly depressed, neurotic, obsessively
worrisome individual (e.g., Carskadon
et al., 1976; Roth, Kramer, &amp; Lutz, 1976).
With this in mind, it is essential to examine
the sleep of anyone presenting with either
depression or anxiety symptoms.


Another potential cause of insomnia
concerns people who have learned poor sleep
habits. One part of this problem may be
that the person never acquires a consistent
sleep rhythm. PWI may inadvertently
disrupt many bodily cycles, such as those
involving temperature regulation and the
functioning of the endocrine system, that
require 24-hour synchronization. This concern
is particularly important for those
employees who work evening, night, or
swing shifts. Careful monitoring of these
individuals' sleep habits is warranted to
determine if they are acquiring sufficient
sleep in order to ensure adequate safety and
productivity on the job.


As mentioned earlier, insomnia can arise
from a number of secondary sources, such as
psychiatric, medical, and substance abuse
problems. The typical treatment for these
cases is directed at removing the primary
cause of the sleep disturbance. However, if
the insomnia complaint has been present for
at least a few months, a learned, behavioral
component often aggravates these sleep difficulties.
Because of their inability to sleep,
people may associate the bedroom with frustration
and arousal rather than with sleep.
Similarly, because functioning with little
sleep for long periods of time produces
stress, obtaining adequate amounts of sleep
may become a major preoccupation of these
people. Thus, a vicious cycle can develop,
where the more one needs to sleep, the less
one is able to sleep. Behavioral components
(i.e., primary insomnia) may develop even in
insomnias secondary to medical, psychiatric,
and substance abuse problems, and these
behavioral components may then need
aggressive treatment.

<b>Course and Prognosis</b>

Insomnia may be transient, chronic, or
intermittent. Transient insomma is often
caused by stress, such as job- or family-related
problems. It can also result from
intense positive emotions related to a job

[p. <i>357</i>]

Unlike transient insomnia, chronic and
intermittent insomnia do not typically
remit spontaneously; therefore, they are
likely to have the greatest impact on the
workplace. Fortunately, the prognosis for
these more persistent forms of insomnia
is good with treatment. Hauri (1991)
estimates that sleep can be improved in
75% of cases by a skilled, well-informed
clinician. As mentioned previously, individuals
with persistent complaints of insomnia
should be assessed thoroughly by a medical
professional (including a polysomnographic
evaluation when necessary) to rule out
other potential causes of the sleep disturbance.
If a sleep disorders center (SDC) is
available, it can provide both evaluation
and treatment. If an SDC is not available, a
properly trained clinician can also provide
such services. In fact, there are now several
good books available for training nonspecialists
(e.g., Espie, 1991; Hauri, 1991).
Although treatment is most effective when
administered by a trained professional
(Morin et al., 1994), books such as Hauri
and Linde's (1990) <i>No More Sleepless
Nights</i> may also be used by employees who
prefer a self-help approach.

<b>Treatment</b>

<b><i>Pharmacological Treatment</i></b>


<i>Brief Description</i>


Medications with sedative properties
(hypnotics) are commonly used to treat
insomnia. There are three main types of
hypnotics: benzodiazepine receptor agonists
(Dalmane, Ambien, Sonata); sedating
antidepressants (Desyrel, Elavil); and antihistamines
(Benadryl). Currently, benzodiazepines
are the most frequently prescribed
hypnotics. Newer, nonbenzodiazepine-type
medications, such as zaleplon (Sonata) and
zolpidem (Ambien), are rapidly gaining
popularity because they have shorter half-lives
than the older benzodiazepines and, as
a result, are less likely to cause the severe
side effects associated with benzodiazepine
hypnotics (see below).


<i>Time Element</i>


Hypnotic medications provide short-term
relief, but they have not been demonstrated
to be effective beyond 6 weeks

[p. <i>358</i>]

<i>Side Effects</i>


Hypnotics, particularly benzodiazepines,
carry significant risk of side
effects, including habituation and dependency
(Langer, Mendelson, &amp; Richardson,
1999). Rebound effects, which involve transient
increases in sleep disturbance and
anxiety following abrupt discontinuance of
medication, are also common. Fortunately,
rebound effects can be avoided in most
cases by tapering the dosage of medication
before stopping it. Daytime residual effects,
which may affect work performance,
include impaired psychomotor performance,
impaired cognitive performance
(particularly episodic memory), drowsiness,
and anxiety. These residual effects have
been associated with increased risk of falls
and accidents (Langer et al., 1999). Because
such events are rare occurrences, it is important
to note that the clinical significance of
these residual effects is unclear. In addition,
many of the side effects mentioned may be
less severe and/or absent for the newer, non-benzodiazepine-type
medications (zolpidem
and zaleplon).


<b><i>Psychological Treatment</i></b>


<i>Brief Description</i>


Psychological treatments target one or
more of the behavioral habits that perpetuate
poor sleep: somatic arousal, cognitive
arousal, dysfunctional thoughts, and/
or learned maladaptive sleep habits. See
Table 17.2 for a brief description of the most
common behavioral interventions.


Because of space limitations, we have
decided to provide detailed coverage of only
two of these interventions: sleep hygiene
and stimulus control. A thorough description
of all of the interventions described in
Table 17.2 is available in a recently published
book on insomnia (see Lichstein &amp;
Morin, 2000).


Sleep hygiene warrants closer attention
because it can be learned quickly and
administered easily. Typically, it is the first
intervention that a treatment-seeking
insomniac receives. Sleep hygiene consists of
commonsense advice regarding five sleep-inhibiting
behaviors (i.e., consuming a beverage
containing caffeine before bed). When
administering sleep hygiene, we have found
it helpful to provide the individual with a
handout listing the behaviors to be avoided
and providing the rationale for each (see
Figure 17.2). The rationale for each behavior
is particularly important, because the
individual will be more likely to comply
with the instruction if he or she understands
exactly how it will help improve sleep.


We also provide the individual with a
log for monitoring treatment progress (see
Figure 17.3). The use of a daily log is an
essential part of many behavioral treatments
because it helps to facilitate behavioral
change. Although research has shown
that sleep hygiene alone is not particularly
effective, multicomponent treatments including
sleep hygiene have been shown to be
effective (Morin et al., 1994).

[p. <i>359</i>]

<b>Table 17.2</b> Behavioral Interventions for Insomnia


Stimulus control also warrants special
attention, because research has shown that
it is the most effective single behavioral
intervention (Morin et al., 1994). Stimulus
control is based on the idea that insomnia is
caused by the faulty association of the bed
and bedroom with activities other than
sleep (e.g., eating, watching TV, reading,

[p. <i>360</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284022-I025&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<i>Time Element</i>


The number of treatment sessions
varies depending on the severity and
etiology of the insomnia as well as the
individual's motivation and adherence to
treatment. Typically, six to ten 1-hour sessions
are needed; however, research has
shown that such interventions can be
administered effectively in as few as four
1-hour sessions (Lichstein, Wilson, &amp;
Johnson, 2000). Slight improvements in
sleep can often be seen within a week of
starting treatment. Significant improve
ment usually takes a little longer, but
research has shown that such improvement
is maintained up to 2 years following
treatment (Morin et al., 1994).

[p. <i>361</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284022-I026&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<i>Side Effects</i>


Although side effects have not been systematically
studied for behavioral interventions,
they are unlikely to cause any serious
adverse effects. One exception to this is
sleep restriction, which may induce additional
sleep deprivation in individuals who
are already experiencing significant daytime
impairment.


<i><b>Psychological Interventions
Versus Medication</b></i>


Both psychological and pharmacological
interventions provide effective
short-term treatment. However, hypnotic
medications tend to lose their effectiveness
over time and are not recommended
for long-term maintenance (Buysse &amp;
Reynolds, 2000). This presents a problem,
because insomnia is often chronic.
Fortunately, psychological interventions
have been shown to provide effective long-term
management of insomnia (Morin
et al., 1994). Another advantage of psychological
interventions is that, unlike medication,
they are not likely to cause unwanted
adverse effects. Unfortunately, psychological
interventions are underutilized.
Although research has also shown that
many insomniacs would prefer drug-free

[p. <i>362</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284022-I027&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />
[p. <i>363</i>]
<b>Workplace Accommodations</b>

Workplace accommodations may include
maintaining referral lists of clinicians
trained to assess and treat insomnia; allowing
the employee to take time from work for
assessment and treatment; and providing
sleep-related education (sleep hygiene
information, and books such as Hauri
and Linde's <i>No More Sleepless Nights</i>).
Employer-sponsored health fairs are a good
way to distribute such information.


For insomnia due to work-related
stress, efforts should be directed at alleviating
that stress if at all possible. For example,
an employee experiencing conflict with a
supervisor may receive help in resolving
that conflict. Supervisors and managers
should be educated about and sensitive to
the effects of outside stressors on sleep
(loss of a spouse, illness, upcoming marriage).
If an employer sponsors an Employee
Assistance Program, short-term counseling
may be available to help the employee cope
with such stressors.


Employees suffering from secondary
insomnia should have adequate access to
treatment for their primary condition
(medical, psychiatric, or substance-related).
Although allowing a sleep-deprived employee
to take on-the-job naps or "power naps"
might have intuitive appeal, it is unclear
whether napping is beneficial for individuals
with insomnia. On one hand, daytime
naps meet some of the individual's sleep
needs and may interfere with nighttime
sleep, perpetuating the insomnia. On the
other hand, researchers have found that a
short nap (less than 30 minutes) improved
alertness in sleepy drivers (Home &amp;
Reyner, 1996) and in college students with
normal sleep-wake habits (Hayashi, Ito, &amp;
Hori, 1999; Hayashi, Watanabe, &amp; Hori,
1999). Research (Della Rocco, Comperatore,
Caldwell, &amp; Cruz, 2000) has also shown
both long (2 hours) and short (45 minutes)
naps can improve performance on computer-based
tasks in night shift workers.
Unfortunately, these studies examined only
good sleepers and night shift workers and,
therefore, do not allow us to draw any
conclusions regarding the benefits of naps
on the work performance of individuals
who do not sleep well and who work the
day shift. Research on the effects of napping
on the work performance of insomniacs
is needed.

<b>Maintenance of Gains/Relapse Prevention</b>

Monitoring an employee's job-related stress
is one way of enhancing maintenance of
gains and preventing relapse. Periodic education
about sleep and sleep hygiene may
also help, along with providing a supportive
environment that encourages an employee
to discuss job stressors and to seek appropriate
health care when necessary. Ongoing
access to appropriate health care and
mental health care (beyond the initial
assessment and diagnosis) is essential for
employees experiencing secondary insomnia.
Although gains made through behavioral
interventions are typically well-maintained,

[p. <i>364</i>]
<b>Summary</b>

Insomnia is a serious disorder that can negatively
affect all aspects of an individual's
life, including the workplace. Job-related
negative effects include health and mental
health problems, tardiness, absenteeism,
accidents, and reduced productivity. In this
chapter, we provided an overview of the
impact of insomnia on the workplace and
recommended referral strategies and on-the-job
accommodations that may help to
lessen this impact.


Diagnosis and assessment by a properly
trained clinician is the first step to dealing
with any type of sleep problem. Although a
subjective complaint of poor sleep is central
to an insomnia diagnosis, polysomnographic
evaluation is often necessary
because other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep
apnea) may mimic the symptoms of insomnia.
Insomnia can occur as a short-term
problem in response to an easily identifiable
stressor that may be positive or negative
and may or may not be job-related (e.g., an
upcoming promotion or the death of a
spouse). In such situations, the insomnia
often remits without treatment, but sleep
medication may help to alleviate symptoms
temporarily. More often, however, insomnia
represents a chronic problem that can
plague an individual for years. The precise
pattern of chronic insomnia varies, with
some individuals experiencing problems on
a nearly nightly basis and others experiencing
sleep difficulties intermittently over a
number of years. These more persistent
forms of insomnia typically require treatment.
We recommend psychological interventions
over sleep medications in such
cases. Medications can provide temporary
relief, but tend to lose effectiveness after a
month to 6 weeks of use. We prefer psychological
interventions because they provide
better long-term maintenance, are unlikely
to cause any serious adverse effects, and are
likely to be more cost-effective in the long
run. When the insomnia is secondary to a
medical or psychiatric illness or substance
abuse problem, the primary condition
should be treated aggressively. Concurrent
treatment of the sleep problem, however,
may also be helpful, because it is not
uncommon for insomnia to develop a
behavioral component in such situations.


One way employers can help reduce the
negative effects of insomnia is by ensuring
that employees have adequate access to
appropriate professional services (see our
suggestions for future research below).
Employees with sleep complaints should be
taken seriously and encouraged to seek
help. By providing adequate health and
mental health care benefits and offering
on-the-job education about the effects and
treatment of insomnia, employers can help
ensure a safer and more productive workplace
for all.


<i><b>Future Research</b></i>


Although a large amount of epidemiological
research details the negative effects
of insomnia on the workplace, no research
has examined the effectiveness of workplace-based
interventions for insomnia.
Thus, development and evaluation of such
workplace interventions is an area ripe for
future investigation. For example, all of the
psychological treatments described in this
chapter could be administered in a group

[p. <i>365</i>]

Another form of intervention that merits
future research is the effect of naps on
the work performance of individuals with
insomnia. Currently, there is no empirical
evidence that addresses whether power
naps are beneficial or detrimental for poor
sleepers. Finally, future research may also
examine the effect of on-the-job sleep education.
It is possible that education about
sleep hygiene and other sleep-related topics,
such as stress management, may have a
preventive effect, helping some employees
to avoid developing sleep problems in the
first place.
