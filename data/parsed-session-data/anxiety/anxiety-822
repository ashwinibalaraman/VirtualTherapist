BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: (clears throat) Gosh, um...I just come in here and like I have no idea what I want to talk about.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: I should probably just give you a life update I guess. Um, I didn't get the transfer...
THERAPIST: Oh, sorry.
CLIENT: ...which was really upsetting at the time. I feel a lot better about the whole thing though.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: I talked with my boss and there was somebody internal that, um, they really wanted, but they had to give other people like their views of one of them.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: But, um...
THERAPIST: This was somebody internal to that store?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Gotcha.
CLIENT: But they also, um, uh, my boss who called and talked to the manager, like ya know wanted to find out what was going on...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...uh, she's gonna try and get me a interview with a store downtown which is actually the one I really wanted.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: But I just expected that I'd never get it. [00:00:56]
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: So, that's good.
THERAPIST: There are more people that work there?
CLIENT: Yeah. It's the largest store in North America.
THERAPIST: Oh really?
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: Yeah, maybe even...maybe not any more but it definitely was, at least a few years ago.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It was a very high-profile store, so...and I would rather do that. It's actually closer to me, which sounds weird. I'm right across the river from them.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: So...
THERAPIST: Gotcha.
CLIENT: So we'll see how that goes with that.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: It's been...just been in general pretty stressful lately. Um (pause) I haven't been feeling so great and then um Mike's depression...it's, it's...the thing is, is that I...I try not to get sucked up in it. But it's really, really flipping hard because it's like (pause) everything that I do to try and carry on normally is...it...it somewhat seems a little bit spiteful ya know? Like, okay, well I know that you're really sad but I'm going to just keep going with my life right now ya know? Ya know. He's frustrated right now. He's frustrated with his research. He's frustrated with himself. [00:02:07]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: So it's kinda hard for him and so (pause) (sighs) I don't know. I just...I...I...I try really hard and most of the time I don't get sucked into it but it is very difficult to, ya know, he's very stressed, and the other is definitely (pause) a personality difference but (pause) we'll see. Like I said there's just all this stuff going on with him that is complicated and (pause) a pain in the ass cuz...at least with my health...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...my health issues don't ever intertwine with mental health issues and so, um, it's not as big of a deal, but like he's going on some new medication for headaches that very well could complicate his depression and you know what I mean....like all this stuff (pause) which, ya know, it makes it very...anyway. He uh, he went to see a neurologist because of his headaches...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:03:25]
CLIENT: ...and so like all the stuff is really mixed up with each other and it sort of all bleeds together and so they're putting him on this medication that does a lot of very weird things. It's usually for seizures but lately they've been doing it for cluster headaches. And so (pause) but it, um, it's...it's...it's like I said it's complicated so...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and um, but we'll see. I'm just glad that at least he's doing something about all the stuff. So (pause) which is good. The bad news is that his...the doctor that usually...well we both see the same doctor like for PCP, and he was telling Mike that like oh for these kind of headaches the best thing you can take is Excedrin really. Like he always pushes over-the-counter drugs for everything. Like I am probably going to at some point do something terrible to my liver because I can't get the drugs I need, right? Well apparently the neurologist made a big deal about like how this was a bad idea because then you get these rebound headaches and you can't be taking this stuff any more and so now he's in agony because he's been taking —at the advice of his physician—like round-the-clock analgesics and so now he feels like crap...he's actually nauseated from the headaches ya know? But they're right. I mean that is true. The fact that you don't take it brings it back ya know? And so it is frustrating to have that confirmed in a different way, ya know? [00:05:11]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: So...it's just...it's always frustrating when like I get angry...though I mean I...I...my budget is very low. I get angry when people decide to make decisions for me based upon my budget which I have nothing...like a doctor's like oh, well this is cheaper. Like but is it gonna work, ya know? And most the time actually over-the-counter drugs aren't cheaper for me cuz then I can't use...it becomes a lot trickier to do flexible spending stuff.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So, I don't know. It's just gets me frustrated because it's like I feel like very disempowered and not necessarily taken care of, so (pause) but that's sort of a common theme with me. (sighs) It's just a feeling of, ya know, having your power end. ya know, not liking it.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: So (pause) but yeah it's (pause) I don't know. I (pause) (sighs) I feel like sometimes I just (pause) it is very frustrating to just be me from day to day. Does that make sense? Ya know, it's not as bad as all that, but sometimes it just seems like it. Ya know it's...it's everything...people's lives don't have to be that difficult. People's lives are not that hard, ya know? But lately it seems like I have a tremendous amount of...difficulty dealing with the red tape of my life slash everything else to do with my life and so I just hate being me ya know? (pause) And, um, yeah. And so sometimes I just want to shut down and I...I really do try. I try and do things, but after the first few times of like dealing with something that is negative I'm just like ya know what? Not gonna do this anymore. I'm really sick of this. And I'm not talking about like easily brushed off. I'm talking about like ya know really getting...ya know dealing with a pain-in-the-ass situation, ya know. (pause) So (pause) and, um, I don't know. I'm just kind of sick and tired of being sick and tired I guess. [00:08:20]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I'm sick of feeling like from day to day that it is sometimes really hard to communicate with people. It depends on what kind of day it is. Um, I'm just sick of being exhausted. Like, I am (pause) annoyed that I spend all day on Wednesday asleep pretty much. I mean I'll do a few things around the house, like maybe run a little laundry. I sleep.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: When I work...yesterday I came home, went straight to bed, woke up for 2 more hours, um, ya know (pause) then went right back to sleep pretty much. That's not much of an existence. Ya know I feel like I'm sleeping my life away. [00:09:03]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: (pause) and it's...it's really lonely cuz I feel like I have reached out to people on multiple occasions. Different people. Different occasions. And since it's something that is very hard to empathize. Like...I can't empathize but they don't really understand it that well. I just don't get the support that I need, ya know?
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: And (pause) that's just (pause) it's really...
THERAPIST: Are you getting much emotional support at all?
CLIENT: I get it from my dad. My mom a little bit. She tries. It's different reference points for her, ya know. Um, (pause) Mike (pause) but sometimes it's...it depends. Sometimes it's...it's upsetting. I...I...it varies so much day to day whether or not like asking for help is good or bad from him...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:10:24]
CLIENT: ...ya know? Um (pause) but (pause) could be. But it's, its...I mean my parents are far away.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: Um (pause)...my mother wants to throw money at the problem and I try and explain to her that no matter how much like she wants to do things for me it doesn't change the fact that I feel bad about it, ya know? Like the occasional things don't bother me. She's like oh, you've gotta an interview, let's, ya know, let's get, ya know, put together something for an outfit. That kind of thing. That's fine. But like, ya know, (pause) she will...and I don't accept most of the money but she's like oh, well why don't you do this or why don't you do that. I'm like I, I, I just can't do that, ya know? It doesn't feel good to do that. Um (pause) ya know as much as she'd like to, ya know, hey do you want to go...you know I'd like to buy you dinner out on your anniversary (that's coming up), ya know, blah, blah, blah, and I'm like ya know what? Honestly sitting in a nice restaurant and realizing that like...which bill we're not gonna pay. Even though the money is going...is being paid for by you it still feels very awkward, ya know?
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: And I just can't let them bail me out, so...I don't think that they really want to. I think that she wants to do small things to cheer me up but at the same time I still, ya know (pause) I'm too practical for that. (pause) It's difficult for me to turn off like worries for an evening. [00:12:29]
THERAPIST: I understand how you like...how you could be too practical to go out for a nice dinner when there are bills unpaid.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I guess I don't understand how you could be too practical to let her help bail you out.
CLIENT: Oh, when I say bail me out. I don't mean like that bail me out.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: I don't (pause) I don't think that they're right now due to some market things...I don't think they...I don't think they have the liquidity to do that. That and I probably couldn't look at myself in the mirror ever again at that point cuz it just (pause) I shouldn't have to have that happen. I have been around my entire life people who relied on their parents for everything and it disgusted me because they have an attitude and they always have their hand out for things and (pause) there are very few things I need. I just need to figure out how to...like I don't want things and I don't really feel like I should have to have my parents bail Mike and I out for things that...like to be honest. If anyone was going to bail us out it should be his folks because most of our debt, the great majority of our debt is because they were screwing around with us, ya know? Um, all of a sudden not paying for school any more and I ended up having to scramble for this or like I could just sit there and if I wanted to I could probably think of tons of things where for some reason or another we ended up being financially screwed, ya know? Because of them not being able to be more honest about finances or anything really, ya know? [00:14:14]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Yeah.
CLIENT: So, if there's anybody that was going to do that, I would just feel terrible that my parents would do that to bail out Mike's...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: ...debt. I mean most...it's my debt now too but, yeah. Not all of it's student at this point. It's probably cars and everything else. So, um, (pause) (sighs) that's part of it too, ya know, it's not (sighs) it's not their responsibility. My mother and father are already very, very sensitive to Mike's family and...they don't really know a whole lot but what they do know is pretty bad. I mean if they knew the whole realm of things it would be more than they could handle. They just really can't, um, but (pause) I just don't feel like that they should have to deal with that, ya know? They didn't make a willing choice to do it (pause) and so (pause) but (pause) it's just (pause) on top of it quite frankly I mean (pause) they're...it hasn't happened very often but every once in a while taking money from my parents has come back to haunt me because then I (pause) I mean no matter what there's always some sort of string, ya know? Um, they're not as obvious as other people's strings. Like I'm not gonna hear this, ya know, I bailed you out and this...ya know what I mean...I won't ever hear that.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But, ya know, at 10 o'clock at night on a Sunday when, ya know, when like the printer isn't working and that ya know, they're, they're, they're like getting...like they're so frazzled...like they've been trying to fix it and they're so frazzled that, ya know, they're not even making sense by the time they call me... [00:16:47]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...I can't say to them then I really need some sleep. I mean ya know (inaudible at 00:16:51) different but ya know I need some sleep. Can we reconvene in the morning?
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: Ya know. I will feel like there are more obligations then and I...setting the boundaries that I normally do with my mom, like saying mom, it's not you, then me. I am just, no matter what I'm going to be negative about everything and I'm going to be bitchy and I think it's probably better that I just go take a nap. And the best part is she's like you were never like that as a toddler. Why in the world do you need like naps for mood regulation now. Like well that's great mom, but...she understands. She's joke...she's trying to be silly. But like I will always feel like I will have more obligations to them if that's happening, ya know? Especially because I know that there are many people who take care of them...some of the needs that they have that are more unusual and probably should be coming out to help out with it. Like getting the...getting the property ready for summer and ya know putting up tents for parties. Ya know, the stuff that...like I have cousins and random people coming to the house to help them out just because they like them and it's like well Mike and I we haven't done any of that, ya know? [00:18:05]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: Um, ya know massive amounts of paper disposition which is always fascinating to deal with. Their X amount of years between how long you have to hold on to something. Now they're changing the rules. Yeah. So it's like I don't even have words to describe to you how many filing cabinets of stuff that they are trying to dispose of right now, and they had just decided there's so much of it that they should just burn it. So it was even weirder.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Yeah. But people are coming by to help out. Like helping trimming the shrubberies and doing all this other stuff. I can't be there.
THERAPIST: Exactly.
CLIENT: Yeah. So it's like I can't even...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...ya know I can't be around to even help with these things.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I feel really bad when it snows, ya know?
THERAPIST: Because you're not helping them...
CLIENT: Shovel snow. I could shovel snow but...I guess I could shovel snow better than one of them, ya know? So (pause) and I just feel like if I cut their help and I'm not there for them when they need me then I'm never gonna be free of myself, ya know? I'll never know when that time is...what that time is for the, ya know, forgive-me part, ya know...the forgive-myself part, but it's gonna be that, ya know, I've had such an ironic sense of bad timing that (pause) that, ya know, I just...I'm afraid that that's gonna be the time that I, ya know (pause) so...and I mean it's not that I won't take care of them anyways without the money but I would feel like I should, ya know? A little bit more than that. I don't know. (pause) That and I just don't like Mike to feel bad about things, ya know? Like, um, my parents are very, very generous when it comes to him and his parents are less so and it is almost...it is almost null for me, and that's okay. Like there's nothing I need. Like I don't need Christmas presents or birthday cards or anything like that, ya know? But for him they should. Especially if they're doing it for all the other kids, ya know? So I think it just brings up more tension to it, ya know. (pause) and my mom occasionally does this thing where she says like I don't want to take the place of his mother. Like, would be like I am awkward. I don't want to do that, ya know? [00:21:02]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But it's like his mom is not ever...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...not just not there but like literally like doesn't call unless she needs something from us or whatever, ya know? (sighs) And so it's like I don't think you're taking the place of his mother at all by throwing a party or by doing this or that, ya know?
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: But...she's awkward about it because she doesn't want to make him feel bad. But she also wants to make sure he has something, ya know? So (pause) like I said it's just (pause) having (pause) the...and, ya know as we were talking more and more about having a family and trying to adopt ya know once I start working at Microsoft some more again, like it's just (sighs) it's gonna get more complicated. It's gonna get a whole lot more complicated and anyone that tries to tell me otherwise is like kidding themselves, because I saw it, ya know? I was around my grandparents. Like my dad's parents really didn't like my mom.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Yeah. It's not like...like my mom they just didn't like her as a person all that much. I'm not really sure why. Mom says she doesn't under...she doesn't really know either. Not like—and this is a whole different thing—like, not like they still saw each other every Christmas and all this other stuff, but I was aware at a very young age. Like I could tell they didn't like her. Like before I was able to really word anything...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...like describe anything else in my life, I could tell they didn't like her. That's weird, ya know? Kids are really, really precocious about that kind of stuff and so like if anyone's gonna tell me that like, that everything's gonna be fine, they're gonna...(frustration sound) it was awkward for me because I was like yeah...I was around...I mean I was around them. They were very...and every word they said was perfectly...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...right. They did everything the way they should have been, but boy they couldn't...I could tell they didn't like her. I could tell that when I had things that were like her later on, like different characteristics, that they didn't like that either. Nothing much. Just little things. Um, but I was really, ya know...it's something that I knew from an extremely early age and they never spoke about it really. Um, I mean they talked about it, but mostly just in terms of just like people...family doesn't have to like each other. They're family kind of things, ya know? And you still get together and you still do this and you do that. You just, ya know...like they explained that siblings like...they pointed out like my dad has 4 siblings, ya know. None of them were the same. At any given time not all of them getting along, but...
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:23:57]
CLIENT: ...ya know, that's just statistically what happens, and...I mean it's not like not getting along like badly but just like, ya know, different.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And so like they put it in a really, really nice way so it wouldn't be like a something's-wrong-with-my-mom kind of thing, just it's not to their taste, ya know? They're British and reserved. Mother's not especially gregarious but she's much more (pause)...she's much more of a free spirit than they are.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: I don't want to say...I'm not talking like that much of a free spirit, ya know?
THERAPIST: Not a hippie.
CLIENT: No, no. Um, I could see her actually describing...talking to hippies and explaining to them how this kind of phenomenon has been shown through history that every like 80 years or 90 years or so this kind of behavior...what they're doing isn't new. And she would like in the Victorian's it was...I can see her describing to them why this stuff wasn't new. Like that's how like not hippie she was like. Um, but yet she was a lot more whimsical than they are. I mean they're just reserved people. And so, um, ya know...but it was not things specific but boy it made an impression on me. And how in the world I am going to have to deal with that with our children is going to be very interesting. Um, I think in certain ways it will be a little bit better because they won't be genetically...cuz my...everything...every single thing about me drives my mother-in-law up the wall. So I think at least having them not be genetically related to me might actually be a bonus for her liking them maybe, ya know? Because at least she won't see that in there. But, I can't imagine her...I don't even know how to answer these kind of questions. Not that I need to know it all now, but it is very daunting. I mean when people have children often they have somebody come and stay with them for a while to help them out, ya know? Um, my mom will probably come and do that, but ya know, as she's getting up there in age she's not really like all that helpful for those kind of things, and I can't imagine that any of his family will ever really...I mean they'll come visit but it will never...I can't imagine his mother actually getting off her butt to visit a baby period. I mean for Kerry's children, yeah, but not for mine and Mike's ya know? And, um, that just kind of...it's very daunting to think about (pause) and so (pause) it's a wonderful nice practical thing to say oh, well you populate people with the people that you love and you have this urban family. You choose those people.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: Yes, but you still eventually have to sit down and answer these questions. My brother's done a freaking fabulous job answering really, really rough, hard questions and I don't have a clue. I have no idea how they did that because hell if I know. Like I am way too blunt of an object to be able to say the right things, like, like things like well, don't you see that Mike's, ya know, Mike's siblings will never get along. Like I couldn't bring that...I can't even pull that metaphor out of my head. I'd be like well, um, it's complicated, and it's not you. It's me. Ya know? (laughs). [00:27:27]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: I mean (pause) I don't even know how in the world they do that. But...and I talked to them about that and they said oh, don't worry. You'll understand them. You'll know. No, no I don't think I will know. I mean just because they had the intuition to immediately say and know their child well enough to know it was the right thing for them doesn't necessarily mean that I'm going to. Ya know, I'm terrible explaining things to kids, ya know? So (pause) and um...I just (pause) it is sort of something of an anxiety of mine. Not a huge one, but it is one, ya know? (pause) Especially because of the fact that Mike was neglected how in the world he's going to figure out how to become a parent, ya know? I don't really tell him I know better...more about like how to parent a child than he does, ya know? And he watched siblings get raised. I don't know. It's gonna be...it's gonna be tricky. (pause) But (pause) the, um...so that's pretty much I guess the major things that have been on my mind as of late.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: I don't know. Just a few light things, ya know. Nothin' big (snorts sarcastically). (pause)
THERAPIST: I guess I'm thinking about (pause) the way that it's so difficult...so kind of against the grain for you to lean on people. Like even your own parents or, as you told me in here, that it takes in here a lot of effort to kind of, uh, lean on me by putting your troubles out there in a way that you generally don't do.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I do for...to some extent with my family, but not as much.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I definitely...
THERAPIST: I sort of have a feeling of two currents in it. One to do with your not feeling deserving? And the other (pause) um, (pause) to do with the way I think it also makes you feel weak or incapable? I mean I know those are two different things.
CLIENT: Yeah, they're different.
THERAPIST: But my impression is they're both there. Like it's both a sign of, ya know, whatever lack of independence you feel you haven't—or should have—and so it's sort of like stigmatizing that way, and also I mean you don't feel worthy of.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So I think some of that has to do with your not sort of, um, working as much and being as much a productive member of society as you imagined you would be.
CLIENT: Yup.
THERAPIST: As you should be. Um, but I don't think that's the whole story, because I think...
CLIENT: I mean that's a very hard, ingrained thing in who I am...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...but it's not the whole story.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I think, ya know, even if you have a 50-hour-a-week job...
CLIENT: Which I've worked 50, 60, 70 hours...
THERAPIST: I know.
CLIENT: ...a week, ya know.
THERAPIST: I know. That, uh, it still wouldn't be easy, but I think that exacerbates it that you don't.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I don't get the positive reinforcement from that. I (pause)...
THERAPIST: Right, and that would help probably more with the sort of inadequacy part, ya know like...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...you're not good enough to deserve it, but I think you'd still feel, yeah (pause).
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't feel like I'm contributing to society enough that's true. The big thing is that (pause) oh gosh, I don't even know how to explain this. (pause) I can intellectualize and understand things but the emotions of it is very different. I really don't...I mean we've talked about this a lot. I don't understand how it is I got myself so easily brainwashed into not...that I am not worth it. I mean I have not been told to my face because I'm not worth being told to my face. I've never been told to my face anything by his family. Usually it's third hand sometimes, but I have never been told, ya know, I've...ya know but I've only been heard that I'm, I'm subhuman.
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:33:53]
CLIENT: Ya know? I'm a basket case, ya know. And by the way there's nothing like to spook you like being told that like everything that you do is wrong, ya know? Or that everything you are is fake, or whatever, ya know? Being emotionally broken or whatever. There's nothing quite like that to make you feel like shit. And I don't understand how cuz I mean, yes I have been told things in my life that were not pleasant by people and brushed it off. I didn't always...I mean I let it bother me a little bit but not really that much. And I don't know why in the world it sunk in so damn deep. I don't even want them to like me any more...especially not his mother. I am so...when she didn't want to come around to help him when we thought he was getting brain surgery, that cured me of ever wanting to be liked or wanted by her ever again and I still have this tremendous self-doubt and I still like because of the fact that I was constantly being berated for every single thing I did by all these women in his life, sometimes now when I'm around certain people and I feel like I'm being henpecked I just shut down. Never had that problem...I mean yes, I was in an industry that was primarily men...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...but I...that wasn't...that whole thing of like feeling like overwhelmed and that-there's-nothing-I-can-do-right thing...?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and people looking for like other...like looking for other motives other than what I'm saying that I'm doing...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...like never had that experience in my life. Never feeling like my God now I have to triple think whatever I'm doing because not only it has to be my own intentions but I have to like figure out what I'm projecting as well. That's (pause) (inaudible at 00:35:43) life, ya know? And it makes me feel very (pause)...I mean I'm angry but more than that it's an anxious way to have to live your life.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: Really anxious way to live your life. (pause) So (pause) I strongly feel that when dealing now with a lot of women in my life. I mean it sounds weird to say like going as a whole gender, but being ganged up by several of them especially, so I freeze up. I have no idea what to do any more...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...cuz it's like oh my God, what do I do now? There's obviously I've gotten something wrong here, ya know? Boy do I not understand anything about this (pause) and (pause) I am mostly angry at myself for letting this happen. For letting, ya know, this happen to me and having to fix alone because I'm better than that. Ya know I shouldn't have that, ya know? (pause)
THERAPIST: Okay (inaudible at 00:37:41) is it to do with (pause) the sort of your vulnerability to what other people think of you and the difficulties of kind of knowing and influencing that.
CLIENT: I still don't have as much, as vulnerability for other people. [00:38:01]
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: A little bit, but mostly just I have to be sort of blindsided by the oh, well now the next thing I know I'm in a closed room door and they're asking me questions about things about something that I can't even figure out what in the world they're really asking about.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: That's more of a work situation. But you know what I'm talking about, something.
THERAPIST: I think so, yeah.
CLIENT: Or like having to deal with somebody, like just, just random stuff in life, ya know.
THERAPIST: Where you're confronted with a, like a certain situation like that where you just don't know what the fuck is going on.
CLIENT: Yeah, like, like...okay like on the bus apparently I had given this woman nasty looks that meant that we were going to go and have a fight (inaudible at 00:38:38) ...not kidding. I had no idea what the hell was going down like at all.
THERAPIST: What happened?
CLIENT: Um, we got into an altercation in which she sort of yelled at me a little bit and I said I'm really sorry. I have no idea like what you're doing and I have no idea what you're saying at me. She was very angry. Luckily I was able to more or less just run away and get in the car.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But I apparently was giving some sort of evil...I don't...I mean I didn't even understand any of the lexicon, the dialect, um, any of the grammar! Like I really to this day do not know what was going down on that one...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: ...but I just felt like oh my...like I literally like picked up and ran like I was on the playground out to the car. That was disturbing, ya know? And like I have no idea what I've done to dig myself out of this but I gotta go. That's really screwed up. Um, I'm sure everybody has a situation in which they deal with someone who's probably mentally imbalanced deciding that you're giving them bad looks on the bus. At least if you spend enough time on the bus you get they're at. Um, I used to be kind of good about that, but I, I just didn't expect that one.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: Um, but ya know that kind of stuff. Like just feeling blindsided, like what's going on here? Why am I in trouble? Why...what is the issue here, ya know?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It's just...I feel like sometimes like I just can't deal with it. It is easier, like I said, when I'm in a situation where it is primarily men.
THERAPIST: Yeah. And the (inaudible at 00:40:14) are generally easier to deal with in this way.
CLIENT: Oh yeah. The (inaudible at 00:40:20) are fine but necessarily...
THERAPIST: Moving forward, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. I'm just ya know like okay, so this is what I was thinking and this was what I was thinking and um I'm really sorry but I guess I was...I just spaced out and looked at something or...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...or maybe I misunderstood the question...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...or ya know whatever. Ya know I just don't deal well with highly emotion-driven decision-making in events Not my emotion driven. Most of the time my emotion driven is I have no idea what's going on in the situation and I don't even know like (snorts)...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...how I got here. Um, but (pause) because of that I just get so confused that I just can't even react to it very well and then I either...like when I try to talk rationally I (pause)...well getting to that point sometimes is very difficult, but if I can then sometimes it fuels the fire because I am not like talking with emotion...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and so (pause)...I just...it's, it's, it's kind...it's so hard for me to understand cuz I'm like why are we having this conversation at all, ya know? I do not have a time machine. I don't have the ability to go back in time and fix this. I said I'm sorry.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I will never do something again, or I don't know, whatever. Whatever it is...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Ya know? Why can't be cut to the chase, ya know, and then ya know well I think that you're trying to spite me. No, I swear to you I didn't try and spite you in this situation. I, I...if I did it would be a lot more.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Or I have to make sure I never say that (inaudible) . If I was really mad at you it would be a lot more obvious. I wouldn't have taken your lunch. I would have taken, ya know...I would have written you an angry letter or something like that ya know. Apparently everybody has the same lunch bag at work lately.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: I haven't had that happen yet, but I was imaging it. But it just (pause) it's something that I don't deal with very well and I'm not uncomfortable with emotions but boy I don't like being like blindsided like that, ya know?
THERAPIST: We need to stop for now.
CLIENT: Sounds good.
THERAPIST: Um, 11 on Thursday.
CLIENT: Thursday.
