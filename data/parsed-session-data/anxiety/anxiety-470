BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay, now let's make up some good stories.  Um, well, I saw you [DATE].  Your problems at that point were, or the good news was that you had not relapsed out, is that still true?  And again, that's always front and center, number one on your problem list, so, we succeeded already.  You succeeded already at this.  Your mood was fair, bouts of anxiety when under pressure or dealing with your mother, work okay, self esteem low.  Some improvement after stopping the alcohol.  Appetite good, craving sweets.  Sleep okay.  Energy/motivation low, no suicidality, not helpless or hopeless.  We thought at that point you were in partial remission.  The alcohol was in total remission.  The depression was in partial remission.  We decided to crank up the Wellbutrin a touch and then augment it with Cymbalta.  Did you go off of both of those?
<b>PT:</b> I'm on both.  Remember, I called you.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> When I took the Wellbutrin and the 450 mg, I had kind of a little reaction to.
<b>DR:</b> You couldn't tolerate it.  It was too much juice.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you went back on to 300?  You're still on 300?
<b>PT:</b> Extended release, the XL.
<b>DR:</b> Right, the XL.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> There are three versions, immediate, sustained release, extended.
<b>PT:</b> Right, okay.  So then you told me to take one, the 300 XL and then one of the 150s and that didn't work either.  So I just went back to the - 
<b>DR:</b> The 300.  So, and, but then you added the Cymbalta.  Has that helped?
<b>PT:</b> Um, my mood's pretty good.  I'm not really fond of the side effects of Cymbalta, but.
<b>DR:</b> Well, we'll get there in a second.  Is it better than it was three months ago, your mood?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess it is.  My mood is better.
<b>DR:</b> So, your mood is lifted some.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And that means, most of the time, you're not sad.
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm not sad.
<b>DR:</b> Not anxious.
<b>PT:</b> I am anxious because I have a lot going on.
<b>DR:</b> Are you irritable?
<b>PT:</b> Um, sometimes, because I have been having sleeping problems.  And I'm not sure it's not the, what's going on at work and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Is your fuse shorter than it should be?
<b>PT:</b> It's hard for me to answer that because I haven't had a lot of interaction with anybody because it's the summer, um, I know, yknow, the first time I hit my dog was in the last month because he irritated me, but.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so you're more irritable than you should be.  The anxieties, free floating anxiety, or it's about specific things?
<b>PT:</b> It's about specific things.
<b>DR:</b> What are you anxious about?
<b>PT:</b> I've got some things to get done paper wise, get ready for some conferences and I'm going up for tenure next year.
<b>DR:</b> So, it's about tenure, is that the underlying anxiety?
<b>PT:</b> That's a big one.  And then family's always a source of anxiety.
<b>DR:</b> Your mother?
<b>PT:</b> My mother and my sister.  And I have a friend who's very ill that I need to go see.
<b>DR:</b> How's your appetite?
<b>PT:</b> Too good.
<b>DR:</b> You've been gaining weight?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.  I think that's, uh.
<b>DR:</b> How much weight?
<b>PT:</b> I'd say I've gained at least 15 pounds.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> What's your energy level like?
<b>PT:</b> It's been pretty, that's hard to answer, too.  I, I, 'cause I got in such a habit of not doing anything, but I mean, um, so I don't know if it's habit.  First it's something else, but, yknow, there's times when I don't have a lot of energy, but -
<b>DR:</b> How about most days?  Do you drag a little bit?
<b>PT:</b> Well, for example, I mean I may not be doing what I should be doing, but I'm not, yknow, it's not like I feel lethargic, yknow, need to stay in bed.  If I'm making sense.
<b>DR:</b> Your motivation's not great.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's, there ya go.  That's the word I was looking for.
<b>DR:</b> But what about the energy?  Just the juice, the ability to do things?
<b>PT:</b> I'd say that that's a little better.
<b>DR:</b> It's better than it was before.
<b>PT:</b> Was, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But still not as good as good as you want it to be.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> How much coffee you drink?
<b>PT:</b> None.
<b>DR:</b> Um, Starbucks is making a mint for a reason, right?  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> But when I do the caffeine -
<b>DR:</b> It gets too much?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> Juices you up too much.  Have you ever tried a stimulant?  Ritalin, Dexadrine, Provigil?  Um, do you have any suicidal thoughts?  Hopeless or helpless?  Able to concentrate okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, when I'm not dead tired.  I think that's part of the problem, not sleeping well is making me -
<b>DR:</b> Right, let's talk about your, um, any exercise?
<b>PT:</b> I take the dog for a nice long walk once a day.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Try and make it brisk and work this here cardiovascular, you only need twenty minutes three times a week.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I gotta start to.  Well, I know I feel better.  I know I felt better when I was out in California, the [DEIDENTIFIED], they made us do it five days a week.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?  And you had more energy from the exercise?
<b>PT:</b> I felt better.  Well, first I had just quit drinking so that was making me feel better.  But yeah.
<b>DR:</b> In the beginning of the night, how long does it take to fall asleep?  On average.  Usually.
<b>PT:</b> That's hard to answer, too.  Like, when I go to bed, I can't sleep.  I toss and turn and then I get up and by the time I'm totally exhausted and my head hits the pillow, I'd say it's been, I'd say ten minutes I fall asleep.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  How many hours after you wanna go to sleep?
<b>PT:</b> A couple.  Two to three sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> So, it's a few hours to sleep.  And then once you get to sleep, can you stay sleeping through the night?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, pretty much.
<b>DR:</b> And what time do you wake up?
<b>PT:</b> The first wake up is probably around six or seven in the morning and that's regardless of when I go to bed.
<b>DR:</b> Is that with the light, you wake up with the light?
<b>PT:</b> I have the dog.  Usually, I have to go to the restroom.  I can go about like five or six hours, then I have to go to the restroom.
<b>DR:</b> Do you ever wake up in a panic or with anxiety?
<b>PT:</b> Not in a panic.  If I start thinking about things, then I might get anxious, but and then, yknow, I'm dead tired and I try to go back to sleep.  I mean, I've been trying to regulate this, like, not sleep until noon.
<b>DR:</b> Have you ever taken a medicine for sleep?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Well, I took the [DEIDENTIFIED] drop on the floor sick medicine.  I think that's how it cures ya.  It knocks ya out.  And I couldn't function the next day  until about two o'clock in the afternoon.  
<b>DR:</b> Um, I'm sure you've seen all these commercials for things that put people to sleep.  You ever thought maybe you should be on one of them?
<b>PT:</b> Um, that would be fine as long, yknow, I don't want to get addicted to something.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  We'll make sure you don't.  Um, over how much time have you gained the weight?
<b>PT:</b> Last two or three months, three or four months.
<b>DR:</b> So, since being on the Cymbalta.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I mean I have gained some weight, but yeah, my big weight gain has been over the summer, so, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Cymbalta.  Is that upsetting to you?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it would be to me too.
<b>PT:</b> I don't wanna have to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You know, you deal with it, but yknow.
<b>PT:</b> I, well, yknow, there's several things since I started with Cymbalta.  I don't know what's worse.
<b>DR:</b> The sexual, are you having sexual problems, you can't have an orgasm?  Zero.  Just can't do it no matter how hard you try?  No orgasm and weight gain.
<b>PT:</b> I'm loving the Cymbalta.
<b>DR:</b> But, yknow, me, maybe it's magical thinking, but sometimes, we need to hope, almost, that if we push you better and then pull it away, you'll stay better.  Think about it.  It's almost like if you ring the bell, then you're okay.  It sounds like we have to get you off the Cymbalta, or at least reduce it because these side effects are not tolerable, is that true?  Okay, so, not to belabor this point.  Is there a reason we changed -
<b>PT:</b> Well, yknow, it's kind of a hard, I don't want to be in a major depression like I was.
<b>DR:</b> That's right, so our question now is -
<b>PT:</b> I don't want the side effects.
<b>DR:</b> Our question now is do we replace the Cymbalta, or just pull back and see how you do?  And of course, with time from the alcohol problem, things should get better for you also.  But -
<b>PT:</b> They did.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, the Wellbutrin was fine.
<b>DR:</b> But you weren't doing well in May, now you're doing great.  Not doing great now, you're doing better but, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not coming in here -
<b>DR:</b> Right and yknow, the switch is still stuck on anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> Well, yknow, sometimes I think that's why I just stay in my house and don't do anything because then I have no triggers but then when I start thinking about the fact that I'm not doing anything, I get anxious.
<b>DR:</b> Would you say it's a motivational thing that the, uh, your depressive illness has fallen into kind of a lack of will to do things, or is it more anxiety that's stopping you from doing things?
<b>PT:</b> I would say it's the motivation first and then the anxiety.
<b>DR:</b> You just don't have the juice.
<b>PT:</b> That's why I'm thinking maybe behavioral, just whether I'm trying to sabotage myself and not get tenure, or whatever, yknow, I'm not quite sure what I'm doing, but up until, yknow, I wasn't sleeping well, because that's my excuse now for not having motivation, um, just the motivation wasn't there.  And I honestly, I don't feel depressed so I can't blame it on depression.
<b>DR:</b> You don't feel sad, but, one of the classic features of depression is kind of a flatness and decreased ability to enjoy things.  What we call [INAUDIBLE].  You probably have that, correct?
<b>PT:</b> I get, yknow, when I get up and finally do something, I feel good about it, if I actually, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> You enjoy it, you get pleasure.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I want to do this. Let's, let's get rid of the Cymbalta and aggressively treat the two symptoms that are really getting in the way, sleep and energy.  All right, so, I mean, the kind of nice thing about sleep and energy is you don't have to be on a medicine every day for it.  You just take it as needed and as it gets better, you can stop taking it.  But I say we put you on a good sleep medicine, get you a good, solid eight hours of sleep every night.  Hopefully, that will do good things for your energy level, but I'm thinking not.  I'm thinking your energy's disregulated because of your mood disorder.  So, I think we should give you a stimulant also.  One that doesn't give you that, that stuff.  You know, there's a milder one called Provigil, that just gives energy without tremor and [INAUDIBLE] charge, you have no change in heart rate blood pressure.  And then, your third ancillary symptom, which is anxiety.  Why don't we um -
<b>PT:</b> That'll kick in in about three weeks when school starts.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have a lot of course work?
<b>PT:</b> Um, yeah.  I just found out, I was supposed to get a course reduction because I was Chair, but they're not giving it to us.  Which isn't horrible but, given all the committee work, it's just I have a lot on my plate with tenure because I've been procrastinating on certain things.  And I actually do, when I actually sit down and do my research and get it done, I'm -
<b>DR:</b> Productive.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And I'm happy and I'm, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> Are you feeling more overwhelmed than you should?
<b>PT:</b> That's probably kicking in a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Are you?  'Cause I would imagine anyone going through what you're going through would feel somewhat overwhelmed.
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, and I have a habit of I've done this forever and it's just waiting until the absolute last minute and then going non stop until I get something done.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's your motivation problem.  You can't mount the motivation until you're really under the gun.  At least you're  finally doin' it.  At least, yknow, be thankful for small things, but it would be nice if you did it in a more adult, mature way and yknow, yknow.  I mean, you can make claims that that's a personality, procrastinating, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> Lazy.
<b>DR:</b> Unconscious aggression, I mean, but I think it's part of your mood disorder.  I really do.  I think it's hard for you to mount the motivation.  Biologically, it's a dopamine problem.  Biologically, you just can't mount that motivation, yknow, and then when you see you're gonna lose everything, you mount it.  But, but I think there's a mere biology to it.  Although psychoanalysts would argue with me and say no, no, she -
<b>PT:</b> No, no, well, maybe it's both.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe.  I'll give them a maybe, but I think it's mostly biological.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, 'cause its gotten progressively worse.  I mean, I used to be able -
<b>DR:</b> Right and a personality problem shouldn't get progressively worse.  It should be the same.  These illnesses get, yknow, when you're more in the depressive stuff it's harder to mount the juice, the energy.
<b>PT:</b> I thought it was age.
<b>DR:</b> Well, age does interact with the system.  All right, so, how do we get you energy.  So, to what extent should we worry about the anxiety?  See, the anxiety, I'll give mostly to the psychology of the whole thing.  It's just making you nervous because you have too much to do and you haven't prepared yourself well.
<b>PT:</b> Well, there's that and I just have, yknow, when something happens at school or, yknow, maybe it doesn't relate to my tenure, I'm just, I'm the anxious one running around doing this, that and people, yknow, and people notice it because they've said something to me.
<b>DR:</b> Like what?
<b>PT:</b> Like, I'm hyper.  I get hyper.
<b>DR:</b> Even when, even separate from the whole tenure issue.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You're on that edge.
<b>PT:</b> If something happens.  I'm not all the time, but I, I can't think of an example right this second but, yknow, if I have a problem with a student, yknow, and I have to go talk to the Dean or, yknow, things I don't really need to be hyper and anxious about I get hyper and anxious about.  I mean, this has been going on -
<b>DR:</b> You've always been that way.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> There's one medicine that might help that.  Have you ever tried Buspar?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think, well, if I did it was a long time ago.
<b>DR:</b> It's an older medicine.
<b>PT:</b> Then I was drinking a lot, too.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so it doesn't count but probably one of the reasons you were drinking is this.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> This regulated anxiety, right?  Which is stuck in an anxious place.  The medicines, the modern medicines that are supported to help that are things like Cymbalta, yknow, serotonin medicines.  But it sounds like it hasn't helped it much.  In an older day, we used something called Buspar, which is only for anxiety problems.  The problem is, for most people, it didn't work so we kind of gave up on it.  The other problem is it yet, it takes two weeks without any effect before you see anything.  But when it works, it's great because it's like water.  No side effects, nothing.  Just boom, just shuts off the anxiety.  So I think it's probably worth trying, although I'm not promising that it'll work.  Far more important will be knocking you at night, getting you a good night's sleep.  Pepping you up in the morning, giving you a stimulant and giving you a basic antianxiety medicine to use as needed.  Now, I know you had the drinking problem, I know people in that world don't like when we use these medicines, but for someone with your level of anxiety, just having a little bit of valium type medicine within reach, not that you're gonna use it all the time, but within reach, will calm you down.  Does that make sense?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Just knowing you can get it.  I know people just having it with them is enough to calm them down because they know whenever they need it, they can rope in the anxiety.  The one I like best for that is called Ativan.  You ever been on Ativan?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> What's nice about Ativan is if you dissolve it under your tongue, it works immediately, minutes.  Now, the problem is, if you take too much, you get really tired or, yknow, sluggish.  So you have to figure out your dose.  That ropes in the anxiety, without making you tired.  I'll give you the smallest pill and in the beginning, just break it in half.  See if that'll cut the edge.  If it doesn't, just increase the dose.  If you take too much, if you take more than your perfect dose, the excess is sedation and, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> That's what I was thinking.  I'm hyperactive, we're giving you a stimulant and then a -
<b>DR:</b> We're giving you as needed anxiety, antianxiety medicine just to have in your pocket in case things really get out of control for you, okay?  Now, you may, we may end up saying let's just put you on it round the clock if you need it.  Right now, you don't need it.  Yknow, you're anxious, but you're not dying or jumping off bridges or yknow, you're all right.  So, at this point, just an as-needed antianxiety medicine in your purse.
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, because that was the number one trigger for drinking and what not.
<b>DR:</b> That's right.  And so, this is another way we're prophylaxing, we're preventing a relapse of alcohol.  Yknow -
<b>PT:</b> This summer, there's been a couple of times I've really blocked the urge, really bad.
<b>DR:</b> There's another, have you heard of Campral?
<b>PT:</b> Is that the -
<b>DR:</b> The anti craving, yeah, the drinking medicine.  I mean, if it comes to that, if you relapse once or twice, we may want to go there.  I, yknow, I hope you don't, but if you do, we probably, or Antabuse.  You ever been on Antabuse?
<b>PT:</b> Is that the one that's supposed to make you sick?
<b>DR:</b> It makes you sick if you drink.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, I took that in the morning and then I, and drank.
<b>DR:</b> Did you get sick?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I got headaches and dizzy a little bit, but I didn't get, obviously not enough to get me to quit drinking.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's impressive.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, when I went out, we were taking [INAUDIBLE] yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's impressive.  Well, let's hope that you maintain your remission, but if you don't we'll go to that.  All right, so let me write these things down.  Um, and at the same time, we're getting off the Cymbalta .  So, here's some 30's of the, but you're on one of the 60's, right?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Take a week of the 30's and then stop.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Now, you may, you may be getting more of the Cymbalta than you're acknowledging now and so things may get a little worse off the Cymbalta.  Just know that.
<b>PT:</b> Well, no, I think my mood's improved a little.  I mean, I, yknow, it's just the side effects.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Number one is stop Cymbalta.  Number two is again Buspar.  Buspar again, it doesn't work for a while.  It's actually, um, you have to take it three times a day, but everyone forgets the middle dose so just take morning and night.  Okay.  Um, so we're going to 15 mg a.m. and p.m.  Three is Provigil.  Provigil is a stimulant, and so it'll be half to one tab of 200 mg.  Okay, either 100, 200.  The biggest problem with Provigil is that insurances don't like to pay for it.  It was, uh, it was made for narcolepsy and sometimes I like to push the diagnosis of narcolepsy to get it because it's very expensive.  It's like eight, nine dollars a pill.  So, hopefully your insurance will let you have it.  And then four, is for sleep.  Now, we could do basic stuff for sleep.
<b>PT:</b> I saw one on TV, Ambien or something.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, Ambien is kinda, is like a sledgehammer and what's nice with you is that you only seem to have trouble getting to sleep, not staying asleep.  So the best thing for just turning the lights out is Ambien.  It'll, I mean, you better be in bed already 'cause you're down.  You are really down, yknow, it's, it's, uh, it's something else.  I mean in ten minutes, ten, fifteen minutes, but you better be ready for it because lights are off.  Um, that's okay, yknow, in the back of my mind, one of the reasons you're not sleeping well is probably anxiety and so another option we sometimes use in someone like you is just an antianxiety medicine at night, rather than sleep medicine so the Ativan at night.  But let's, let's do something that'll really turn the lights out.  Eventually, we may switch over, okay?
<b>PT:</b> You don't wake up groggy?
<b>DR:</b> No, not at all with Ambien. And then number five is Ativan.  Anywhere from 0.5 to 2 mg as needed for anxiety.  Tell me if that's clear.
<b>PT:</b> What's the third one down?
<b>DR:</b> Provigil.
<b>PT:</b> And that's for?
<b>DR:</b> Stimulant.
<b>PT:</b> Stimulant, oh, that's right.  Ambien sleep and other type drug for anxiety.
<b>DR:</b> Of course, you're gonna continue the, uh, Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Do you take one a day of the XL's?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  I'll just tell [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I don't need to see her any more.
<b>DR:</b> No, she's doing good work with you.
<b>PT:</b> No, she's -
<b>DR:</b> Um, okay.  Wellbutrin,  do you get the three months supply, or do you go to your regular pharmacy?  Do you mail it away?
<b>PT:</b> No, but I mean, it doesn't, they keep it on record for however long.
<b>DR:</b> Right, for refills.
<b>PT:</b> Because all of these drugs, Wellbutrin, I don't pay anything for because they give me the, um, as I find the words.
<b>DR:</b> Generic.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.  I'm sorry, yeah.  No wonder I'm having a hard time.  Um, with all the other, they have like three levels.  If it's not one of their approved drugs, it's, I don't, it's like thirty dollars, forty dollars and there's a mid level and then if it's generic it's -
<b>DR:</b> Just expect problems with the Provigil.  The others are all -
<b>PT:</b> Okay, and if they won't -
<b>DR:</b> The Ambien is generic and the Ativan is generic, too.  Again, the Ativan, I'm gonna write that you take five a day.  You get a lot of them 'cause these, we can't refill over the phone.  But, you'll take, just have some with you all of the time and as needed to cut the edge, you take a little Ativan, okay?  And we'll see, we'll see what you need.  If you take too much you'll get tired.  Don't take too much, but find the right dose.  If you don't take enough, you'll still have the anxiety, so find that dose.  You can take it by mouth and it'll work in twenty, twenty five minutes.  Under the tongue it'll work right way.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Any questions?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Let me see you again in about two months.  Oh, the Buspar.  I didn't write for the Buspar.  Did I write it there?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  Now, should I start all this even as I'm stopping -
<b>DR:</b> Yep, all of this, all of them.
<b>PT:</b> I got one of those pill containers.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that's kind of a quick lay up on the Buspar.  Does that make sense to you?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> You won't feel the Buspar for a few weeks, but when it works, it's really quite nice.  Okay, I'll see you in about two months.
<b>PT:</b> Will do.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, take care.  She'll write your name on [INAUDIBLE].  All right.  Bye.
<b>PT:</b> Bye.
