<b>DR:</b> Well, how you been?
<b>PT:</b> I'm doing great.
<b>DR:</b> Are you?  Good.
<b>PT:</b> I am doing great.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Most of the time.  I, I have the, the little, um, you know, sensitivities and right now I'm having my period, which is kind of getting into the irregular cycle with perimenopause and —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Um, you know.  One month it'll be light.  Next month it'll be real heavy.  Um —
<b>DR:</b> Did anybody do a hormone, done hormones tests or —
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I go back for my OB/GYN yearly thing, uh, oh gosh, I think it's August, September I got it scheduled.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so reasonable time to —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Talk about that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And, um, you know, the, the only other thing that I notice, and these, I think, are probably just normal emotions, are —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Are just, um, not anxiety.  It's not really anxiety.  It's just like, and I think I mentioned this before, um, um, a sense of immediate response, you know.  I, I just am like come on, uh, you know, CBO, call me back please.  You know, um, what is it, a lack of, a little less patience maybe —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> As I get older.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Do you, do you think that that's a kind of regular kind of response?  Is that the way you're, you're feeling all the time with, with anything that requires a little bit of —
<b>PT:</b> I think it's more —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Than it used to be, more irregular.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, because, and, and I don't want to become, uh, you know, a bitchy old lady.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> You know what I mean?  Um, in August, we joined [DEIDENTIFIED] —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know.  So part of my job went over to the central billing office, and I, I [INAUDIBLE], just the change is, is one thing, and, and I'm not adverse to change.  I love change.  I think change is challenging and great, but as far as support people, I have a hard time getting, uh, somebody to pick up the phone.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So, you know, and you have claim, a claim here and you're stuck on it, and it's like please call me.  I've left messages, you know, and I, I don't want to be that way.  I think it's more often than what my normal, uh, personality was.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I, I don't think it's anything like you had mentioned before where I, I want to chop somebody's head off or smack them in the mouth or anything like that —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But I, I, I just want to keep that, whether I have to do it personally —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Or whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I want to keep that.
<b>DR:</b> Can you, can you, can you walk away from it?  At the end of the day, can you —
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Put it away and go home and —
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And, um, and I can't say I have road rage or, uh, I really, I'm trying to think of other aspects of my life outside of maybe work that, um, you know.  I try to, I, I really can't say like waiting in the grocery store line or anything like that —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Is been a big deal.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So, really it sounds like it, it's fairly isolated to that workplace and —
<b>PT:</b> And, and the change probably —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And me losing the control I was able to —
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I was able to pick up the phone and call, send them a W9 form.  They'd have to —
<b>DR:</b> Take care of it all.
<b>PT:</b> You know, take care of it all, and now you, you have to stem through and wait.
<b>DR:</b> Is there somebody else doing something similar to you there?
<b>PT:</b> In my office?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, in your office.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So it's kind of, there's no ability to kind of share frustration or even —
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Kind of gauge where am I at compared to —
<b>PT:</b> And the thing is, you know, I was your billing person here for six months, and went back to CBO.  So I worked in CBO, but I'll tell you what, I was at my phone, and you know —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I was a lead customer service rep, and when those clinics called, you know.
<b>DR:</b> You knew the other side of it.
<b>PT:</b> I, I did, but, but I, I also wasn't, you know, and I expressed, expressed with, when we met with [NAME OTHER] from CBO and even the VP and the, you know, CFO, um, that I seem to have a hard time getting somebody to pick up the phone.  I'll go down the phone tree and she was like, well, you know, we are busy, but to me support is support, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And, and so I guess I look at it differently.  I like, I like to be there and get the questions answered, and, um, have them on their way instead of have to return the call and then you dig up out of your hold folder, and let me see.  Let me refresh my memory.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> That was two days ago and —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Twenty five claims ago, but anyway, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Well, but I do.  I mean I, I guess I, you know, [PATIENT NAME] —
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I think, I think your frustration speaks well with you.  I mean it, it does.  Like you said, I, I will tell you, sitting in this chair, my, my common refrain to patients expressing frustration with our billing office is, you know what, I'm a physician for [DEIDENTIFIED] and I call the same number you call, and I'm sorry for that.  I mean we, you know, I know we, you know, we ask questions about collections and why we don't do more, why we continue and our answer from our clinic manager is because about 50% of the people that we have data on is incorrect.  So we wouldn't dare make a decision about treatment based on that, and it is.  I mean I, I, like I said, from our end, I, I understand the frustration that you're seeing, experiencing too —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> And I guess to me it, it sounds, it sounds like it's, it's placed in the right context.  It's, you can walk away from it —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's occurring at work.  It's occurring from an advocacy position, from a position of being taking responsibility for your job, wanting to do better, wanting to be more.  I mean I think, again, it's sometimes the hard part is with the quality is to figure out when you've done what you can do.  You've shared that information with the people that are in a position to try to facilitate some of those changes, and right now they're not.  Sure, I mean you can still advocate in that way, but I also think there's a point of saying, look this doesn't, you know, need to be kind of your windmill to charge at a level beyond a reasonable discussion —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> About it.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  That's what I need to remember.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and so then I think it does kind of shift to that point of going, okay, look, part of this is cognitively I got to figure out, okay, when this happens, again, it doesn't sound like you're doing things that are so extreme —
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> But I do think it is that part of, of really being able to kind of identify and go, okay, you know what, got to pull back.  Can't control this.  This is how they're choosing to run CBO, uh, you know, I, I am going to have to get kind of my workspace organized with the expectation that when I'm dealing with CBO, stuff's going to have to go in the hold pile until I hear back from somebody, and, you know, at reasonable points in time, I will, you know, maybe, you know, kind of once a day, I go back through my hold pile and I make the return phone calls just, you know, following up on this, but I, it's disappointing, but it's the nature of the system and —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Like you said, there'll be opportunities, I'm sure, still to give your feedback in terms of that and —
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> You know, and sharing that.  And who knows, perhaps some day, a position where you can actually fix that, and, uh —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know, we can all be, you know, the place got so much better when [PATIENT NAME]'s in charge.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> But I do, and you know, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> And that, that drives me nuts to hear that your, your patients are still having —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Issues.  When I was, when I was there, I mean my God, they wrote off like $5.9 million of uncollected because the system was so bad, and then they got the upgrade through [DEIDENTIFIED] and everything and, and so I understood it was so much better, but, you know, I, I want to be the patient advocate.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I mean even for Medicare patients, you know.  When they come in and they're asking questions, it's like if you ever have a bill or a Medicare EOB that you cannot understand, bring it in when you come to your next appointment and I will help you sort that out and I, I would love to have, if there was any way I could do it and make a little money, I, I would love to be that person.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> But anyway —
<b>DR:</b> Well, but I think, again —
<b>PT:</b> That's a whole different story.
<b>DR:</b> But again, I think that those, those are those qualities that speak well of you and really, even though I understand that there are changes being made, it, it sounds like, you know, really, you're, you're doing good things in your position even if, you know, some of that is a little bit more behind the scenes in terms of it, so.
<b>PT:</b> A little bit.  I'm, I'm able to, so.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So give yourself that credit and, and I think, again, that realizing that that frustration is at least, I think, um, well placed in an advocacy role and, and, but I think it is a matter of saying, okay, look systemically do I need to kind of pull back and go, look, this happens enough.  When it happens, what, what do I do with it?  You know, do I, like you said, do I have my, you know, CBO on hold file with, you know —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> And I just, and it's, it's got go there.  It's got to —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Because you can't, you can't otherwise control that part of things.
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> Um, and, and but I think with a little bit of adding a little bit of that just almost mantra —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> You know, maybe you need to, if you take the [INAUDIBLE] above the CBO hold box, and you know —
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> That may, if that works —
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.  Exactly.  Right, and you, you don't have to go through the whole thing.  You can use a couple of words, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But I guess it does.  I mean you, you, you sound healthy in what you're doing.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I, I —
<b>DR:</b> Really how you handle it and everything.
<b>PT:</b> I feel great.  I have actually am negotiating another position outside of [DEIDENTIFIED], uh, for a billing manager position with [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Sure.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Out in [DEIDENTIFIED], and, um, I, I countered and I said, you know, I can't move for less than $50,000 and he's like, oh, I don't know if we can do that.  I said well, that's, and so he said, well, let me talk to the doctors.  So, it's, the ball is in his court.  It's been quite stressful back and forth, but I, I really have a good, great job with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I mean he has very few office patients, so it's a very quiet office and, and there's only three of us.  We have flexibility.  We have a great relationship.  We, you know, yesterday I came in and I said, hey, you guys, we got to have a powwow about my family.  Uh, oh, my brother's going through a lot of crap with his marriage and, and dad's health is deteriorating and his ex, not even ex.  They're not, they're not ex yet.  Well, if they will be, but, um, his wife and her dad came up to my mom and dad's and just unloaded about my brother, and, um, this was the night before last, and so, and, and, you know, they all pulled up their chairs and our coffee, and, and we just talked it through and they, I mean —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's worth a lot.
<b>DR:</b> That's nice.  It is.  You're right.  You're right, and I think in fairness, look, you, you bring a lot to the table.  I give you credit for advocating for yourself and saying, hey, look, this really has to be something substantial for me to change where I'm at.  I like where I'm at, but I also, and I think, again, on the other side of things, that's a respectable position to take, and say, look, I do like, I like my job currently, and like you said, there'd be, there'd be some, some things that would be substantially different about changing over to that kind of office.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But, um, you know, the docs all seem nice.  I'm sure it's a, a good place to be too, but you —
<b>PT:</b> Do you know many of them?
<b>DR:</b> Um, I do.  I mean I see, you know, who, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s there.  Um —
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] or [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is there who seems like a very nice guy.  Um —
<b>PT:</b> But they've said they're very great to work for.
<b>DR:</b> And I'm trying to think of who the younger female is.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Anyway, the, the, what I've seen, about how they're all very pleasant from consult service.  So, like I said, I don't know anymore of the dynamic in the office obviously.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, good.  So, I at least feel like you got some options too.
<b>PT:</b> Very exciting, dating a very nice guy.
<b>DR:</b> Are you?  Good.
<b>PT:</b> Um, just, I'm just having way too much fun.
<b>DR:</b> I'm glad.  Well, I know, I know, and I know you've seen [NAME OTHER] since we last talked, and, uh —
<b>PT:</b> I can't remember if I did or —
<b>DR:</b> She got me, yeah.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Did I?  Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, just one visit I think.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I, I don't know what happened, if I didn't schedule.
<b>DR:</b> It's been a while.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you look familiar.  No, it's okay.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  You remember me?
<b>DR:</b> Well, I do.  Absolutely.  Well, and like I said, and I, and I know that, you know, I, I know that things had been stable and like I said, I know you'll call me too if —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Yeah, I will.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Something, are you using any of the Alprazolam these days?  I know we refilled, gosh —
<b>PT:</b> Yes —
<b>DR:</b> A while ago.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I am.  I'm still using it at night.
<b>DR:</b> That's fine.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Just one.
<b>DR:</b> Yep, and I remember last time we talked, occasionally you take two, but that was about it.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I don't, yeah, maybe once I took two or twice, you know, and since I saw you.  Uh, I did break a half a one to go out to the interview just to slow my heart rate down —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And so I can think, you know, think before my lips start moving.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  No, and I think —
<b>PT:</b> But, but, uh —
<b>DR:</b> And I think that's a perfectly good use —
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Of that.  I really do.  Absolutely.  I mean and again, I know that we give you enough extra to take one or two at bedtime if you need it.  So —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're, you're not going to be running short on it otherwise, but no, I think, look, if it's maintaining sleep consistency for you.  I mean —
<b>PT:</b> It is.
<b>DR:</b> And, you know.
<b>PT:</b> It is, and I sleep great with it, and I don't wake up with that Tylenol PM, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I mean Tylenol PM is one of those, I mean if people, it's an over the counter agent, but I tell you what, the side effect profile for Benadryl for sleep for many people is far worse than a number of these other options.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And I mean this is a nice low dose of Alprazolam.
<b>PT:</b> And, and one, one thing I, I've noticed, if I haven't taken it.  Like over the weekend, I didn't take it at mom and dad's until I got up, and I would have like these, oh, not nightmares, but just, just kind of like windy feeling like, like, like things are passing fast and I, I'd kind of wake up and, and then I'd go back to sleep and then I'd just kind of have that.  So, and then I just got up and I thought —
<b>DR:</b> You're going to take it.
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to take one.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Has that happened other times when you, when you've gone without a dose?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, just kind of an anxious feeling.
<b>DR:</b> It's, it's hard to say.  Your dosage is so low, but the other side of the coin is that it's, it's so low and you're responding to it, so you're more sensitive than some people —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Might be, and so people can get a little bit of mild kind of rebound insomnia with discontinuation.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, generally —
<b>PT:</b> And if, if I ever feel that I need to discontinue it, then we can talk about how to do that.
<b>DR:</b> Well, and probably —
<b>PT:</b> Break it down.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.  All I would do would be break it half.  Maybe do that for a week.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then stop it, and again, nothing, at the dosage you're at, nothing medically serious is going to happen even if you stopped —
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> It abruptly.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Like you said, you may have generally rebound insomnia is, a couple of nights.  I mean I certainly wouldn't argue that —
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> It, it couldn't happen for four or five days, but it may well just be that it's one or two nights and that's fine.
<b>PT:</b> Would you suggest that, or do you think I don't even have to worry about it right now?
<b>DR:</b> I think that you're doing so well and you're feeling good.  I mean what I can't tell you is it's also possible that, again, you do have a little bit of insomnia just with discontinuation and that's what this is treating too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's, it's always a little hard to say in those dosages and with those kind of, what ends up being, it's one or the other.  I, I think that if you really feel compelled and you want to try to go without it, by all means, you could break it in half.  Do that for a week.  See how you do.
<b>PT:</b> It doesn't bother me.
<b>DR:</b> But it doesn't bother me.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I mean I'll be the first to tell you, you're, you're, you're on a low dose.  You're taking it once a night.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> Um, it's, it's a reasonable thing to do when you're sleeping well.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And I think if you tried stopping it and you've had some insomnia, I think more likely than not it probably has to do with insomnia rather than, uh, discontinuation syndrome —
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> From, from this low a dose.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, and so, no.  I think it's perfectly fine, and, and really I think it's reasonable.
<b>PT:</b> So, just keep up the regular and the, the Effexor is working great.
<b>DR:</b> I was going to say, you do.  You just keep [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Now that, that one, if, if I miss it, forget it in the morning, by 4:00 or 5:00, boy, I can feel it.
<b>DR:</b> And that one is, again, not anything that would be medically serious, but we're on the opposite end of the spectrum there.  You're on a good dose of the Effexor and the higher the dosage of Effexor, and most of the antidepressants, if you abruptly discontinue them, people get them what we call antidepressant withdrawal.  It's not because they're addictive or habit forming.  It's just that there's, there's serotonin and norepinephrine in your central nervous system, and in your, uh, gastrointestinal tract, and you just get kind of a quick rebound.  You've already upregulated some of your receptors based on the medicine, and you get a quick rebound with that, and that's why people can have nausea.  Sometimes they feel kind of flu like —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, achy.
<b>PT:</b> I have like a, a loose head feeling.
<b>DR:</b> Yep, and it's, and it's really, and it's not, it's not, again, not a medically serious condition from the respect that nothing is consequential is going to come of it other than most people within 24 to 48 hours will notice that with something like the Effexor.  It gets, a couple of these medicines get really cleaned out by the liver quickly when you discontinue them, and it's just the nature of how our body handles different medicines.
<b>PT:</b> So, so long term, I could never go off of it then?
<b>DR:</b> No, no, no.
<b>PT:</b> Will my body —
<b>DR:</b> We take people off it all the time.  All we got to do is, this once again, it's a taper, and generally people, you're on 300 mg.  Generally what we don't have to do is taper all the middle dosages.  It's at the end.  It's that abrupt discontinuation.  So usually what we've done is gone to 75 mg for a week, 37.5 mg for a week, which is just how you started it.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> And then we take if off.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And, and, uh —
<b>PT:</b> And then my body will, will produce the normal whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's right, and then people, people, that regulation shifts back and it's normal.  Not that people can't have a little bit of those symptoms, but generally if they do, they're far more mild than abrupt discontinuation.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not interested in discontinuing it, so.
<b>DR:</b> Well, no, and your history is such that I'm not going to be the guy telling you that you need to either, and so I think that that's fine right now in terms of it, but at the same time, do know that it's substantially different just to taper it down a little bit.  And, and we've gone longer, if people are real sensitive to it.  Um, there's even a little bit of literature that sometimes they've added in a dose or two of Prozac, which is, which stays in your system.  It's the opposite spectrum.  It stays in your system for a couple of weeks.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And so sometimes if people are just sensitive enough that it really bugs them, we have them go buy a $4 script for Prozac, give them a couple of dosages of that.  I think I've had to do that twice in 10 years, but if we need to, we need to.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> Um, but no, and that, and that, but that's a very common, Effexor is the one medicine if somebody's traveling and they run out on the weekend, we'll get a phone call from [DEIDENTIFIED] saying —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Hey, will you call this in for me?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, right.
<b>DR:</b> I thought I was going to make it until I got home and I feel kind of crummy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, so no, it's worth doing that, but again, know that it's, it's not anything that's going, you know, that's going to cause any significant medical consequences.  It's just a matter of feeling a bit crummy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, and you also know it's that versus something like the flu is when you take the medicine, the symptoms ought to go away within about an hour or so.  It's pretty quick once you get it back in your system —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yep.
<b>DR:</b> It, it puts an end to it.  Whereas, if you got a bug or a virus or something, uh, I think there would be a difference.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, it's, it's very, so I'm, I'm, I'm doing so good —
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not interested in changing anything.
<b>DR:</b> No.  No, and I think that's —
<b>PT:</b> I just wondered long term.
<b>DR:</b> Anything, anything, any new medicines or any other changes health wise?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I'm on the two blood pressures and the Effexor and, uh, I take, uh, the multivitamins and calcium magnesium —
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> And vitamin C, but no, nothing else.  Oh, my health has been good.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> I think I dropped about five pounds.  That's a good thing.
<b>DR:</b> That's what I was going to say, you do, you look thinner than last time we talked.
<b>PT:</b> Really?  Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> How have you done that?
<b>PT:</b> Um, just have, been busy, happy and, and, uh, just not sitting there eating and not doing anything I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Life's been [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That is.  That's all right.  That does make, that does, yeah, exactly and I think that's it.  And I think even, you know, this time of year —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> There's opportunity to be outside —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Add some walking to things if you're already at a point with the healthy diet, um, then a little bit of physical activity —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you'll get the other, other health benefits in that regard.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Actually I went over to a friend's last night and, and we were going to either walk and talk or have a beer and talk, and we ended up having a beer and talked.  So —
<b>DR:</b> You know, [PATIENT NAME] —
<b>PT:</b> But we had a great time.
<b>DR:</b> Again, don't, don't deny yourself some simple pleasures in that too.  The fact that, the, uh, you, uh, you did that and enjoyed it sounds awfully healthy to me.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, we, we did.  We, we got a lot to talk about three of us, three gals, and we had a lot to talk about.
<b>DR:</b> That's nice.  [INAUDIBLE].  You, you've got refills, um, I think because we got everything, we got everything into your mail order system now I think.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, gosh, I don't, I don't think you're going to be due for refills for quite a while.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, I'm sorry, the one thing as I'm holding this out in front of you here, is, see, should we schedule back in like six months?
