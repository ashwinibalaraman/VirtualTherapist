BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: Interview 2, Interview 2. Well I know you didn't get any money.
CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't have to take it. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Is this, was this... [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Well kind of like... 
COUNSELOR: ...needs to take this one?
CLIENT: Well I mean just like gas and then kind of (chuckling) where I should be in Texas or somewhere and anyway no money, no help (ph). [0:00:24.3]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Sounds like you've been talking to her. (chuckling) I just can't get into this right away.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. No, I can understand, it's like depending on which way you're feeling. (client chuckling) You know what I'm saying, Kerry, she made a video of it... [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Right, kind of I know. I don't know what to talk about. (chuckling) [silence from 0:00:53.0 to 0:01:12.5] I don't even know where to begin, again.
COUNSELOR: Why don't you know? I mean as far as getting a sense, I mean if you could view the loss as like...to get these things talked about and that you sit and kind of think about where you are or what's the next incentive...and it's what's happened to them is, in a sense, even more availed in the sense that you've found out that you ... [inaudible at 0:01:36.7] ...you know whatever is going to pull (ph) for you as most important for you.
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] [silence from 0:01:44.5 to 0:02:05.4] Well let's just talk about this girl.
COUNSELOR: Yeah?
CLIENT: Yeah. I've known this girl for about, oh, I guess it was four or five years, and she's [born in the same place], just sort of a girl I used for a prostitute. So she worked at this corner and we had met at this party in a house and all this stuff. She was a whole lot of fun...and so, yeah, done a lot of crazy things. Her and this other girl are best friends and her name is Tanya and the other girl's name is Katie and they were crazy you know.
COUNSELOR: What did they say to you naturally?
CLIENT: Yeah, well, yeah, so it was kind of...sitting around and we just have done several things together...going to crazy parties and did crazy things. And they were kind of like...at, where you're using a small (ph) if I could put, count on this relationship...and we were very close friends and somehow like I said, we've gone to a lot of parties and we've been to a lot of parties together and... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:03:41.4]
CLIENT: ...well we all went to the same college but we never really knew one another until, oh God, I was a junior, I want to say a sophomore, then Katie came to the college later. But, yeah, we always spend Saturday seeing one another at school and things like that. But the relationship is between Tanya and I, it was...like we really got along together...real well and even...things that bother one another and we like one another's company and we don't get bored with one another quick at all. And... 
COUNSELOR: [So is Katie going to be in there any?] (ph) [0:04:29.5]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it was kind of, it was really nice. And, I don't know how to describe her. She was a typical Cancer. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean?
CLIENT: Well I don't, it doesn't really matter but I might as well... 
COUNSELOR: Sounds bad.
CLIENT: No. No. I mean...it's not really.
COUNSELOR: Yeah?
CLIENT: She's the type of person that really, it's if you met her on the street or...if you met her for the first time you'd think, "Well, who in the hell does she think she is?" (chuckling) You know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. She's got to grow on you, is that what you mean?
CLIENT: Yeah, right, she's got this facade about her (chuckling)... 
COUNSELOR: I know.
CLIENT: ...that...you just see well she's so cold...you don't want anything to do with her...you just, it's the first reaction you get, the first one I got anyway...and most people do...they're thinking, you know, "Who the hell is she?" You know just the type that if she'd smile her face would crack. (chuckling) And she has this faï¿½ade that once it breaks...once it breaks down then you're friends...and you really get along together tremendously. She's a homemaker type like...she's in, she takes home economics and...she's into...all this sort of stuff. She's...she's a lot of fun. So, like I said, we have been good friends for a long time and I think it's about, I don't know, last year or something like this...she was, we really saw a lot of one another. And, it got...like, she would...it was like I got the feeling that she had kind of taken to me...and I...I really didn't like it. (chuckling) So, and...it seems that - I don't know how to describe it. (chuckling) So at any rate, then I would break down and she said...really came out and she says, "Well you feel as if I'm a threat to you." You know like this and I said, "Yes."
COUNSELOR: When was this?
CLIENT: Oh, when was this?
COUNSELOR: [During a free period?] (ph) [0:06:59.0]
CLIENT: Yeah. I can't think. Well, Christmas, I think it was around Christmas...and "You mean you've got a lot of hang-ups?" I said, "Yeah." And she says, "Well what are you going to do about them...you have to." And I said, "Well I, well I suppose I should seek professional help." And she said, "Yes, you should."
COUNSELOR: Because she wants you but in different way and that's...?
CLIENT: Yeah, she didn't want me as more of a... 
COUNSELOR: As a friend?
CLIENT: ...as a friend...she wanted me... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know.
CLIENT: ...as a lover. And I said, "Yes." And so, she was the one who...she talked me into sleeping with, well...she didn't talk me into it but at least she suggested. And I said, "I wouldn't know where to go." And she says, "Yeah." You know I was just, I said, "I have no really way to...to go with." And she says, "Well I'll ask if Father..." [inaudible at 0:07:51.2] ...this priest who is a friend of ours, and he's really an all right guy and he does counseling work...at the high school. So she got me this number from him...so, at any rate, I said, "Yes." So I like...so I came here. But when was it, last, last weekend, the past weekend, I was by her house Friday night and she's going, she is in the Bahamas right now and she, we're...she's doing great...sex (ph) and things like that and we had finished and she said, she has a real family, and she says, "Well what do you want to do...it's Friday night?" And I said, "I don't know, what do you want to do?" And she's, "Well I want to go to, I want to go to the drive-in movie and not watch the movie." And I said, "Oh, yeah?" I said, "Well why bother going to the movie? (chuckling) Why bother spending money to go to the movies?" Said, "Okay, let's go to the forest reserve." So I said, "Okay." So, we went to the forest reserve and the forest reserve is in, out where she lives out in... [inaudible at 0:09:07.9] ...okay, so this forest reserve that I used to go onto when I was very young. And so I said, "Okay." So we went to the forest reverse...and we made love and I really enjoyed it...and it was really kind of nice. And she said...she really liked it when we made, so...we ought to become, both of us ought to become more a friendship and I said, "Right." I said, "I'm going, I'm..." I said, "I go for therapy, what do you do?" (chuckling) Or something like this, I don't know. And she says, "Well I've I read the Sensuous Woman." And I said, "Oh, wow!" So at any rate, it was left at that...so, it was kind of nice though, I enjoyed it.
COUNSELOR: Were you seeing it as more of a friendly (ph)...?
CLIENT: Oh, we just made out you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you made out... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...but you really liked her?
CLIENT: Yeah, I really liked her...it was nice...it was all exciting and everything, it was nice, so. [0:10:06.7]
COUNSELOR: And what?
CLIENT: And I don't know how...like, when she gets back I don't know if we'll just pick it up again or whatever, (chuckling) I don't know, whatever... 
COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:10:14.5]... 
CLIENT: ...you know if we're going to be. Yes and no. Because... 
COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... 
CLIENT: ...she says, from it...of course, so like I said, I haven't seen her for a long time... (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and we're sitting at dinner and her, well her, is it, was her mother the subject, something about marriage or something like that and Tanya says, "Oh, he won't marry me." And I said, "Why?" You know I didn't say anything then...and then later on in party she says, "Were you mad because I said you wouldn't marry me?" And I said, "No." And she goes, "Well, are we going to talk about it?" And I said, "Well what do you want to...well..." - No, she goes, "Well would you marry me?" And I said, "At this moment, no." And she said, "Well I just wanted to know you know and it's like, I don't want to waste my time." And I said, "Well I don't blame you." And she's, "But I said it the cheapest (ph) way." You know as far as wasting her time with something that's...it feels like this ID, it's my job, that or something like this. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but kind of like, when you say yes or no, like you don't...you have to want to see the... [inaudible at 0:11:26.0] ... view as part of your own life, do you want her to drag you to the alter?
CLIENT: (chuckling) I don't know. Well the, and I told her at this point, I said, "At this point in my life" I said, "I'm too mixed up to get married, you know." And I said, "There's no...I can't, I can't tell you now, you know." And she's, "Well when will you be able to tell me?" I said, "Well after 25." (chuckling) And she said, "Oh, the miracle of it all?" And I said, "Oh, yeah." I said to be, (chuckling) I wasn't serious but...she just, and as far as marriage is concerned, like I said, I...I'm too confused right now and... 
COUNSELOR: [You'd be able to announce that.] (ph) [0:12:10.8]
CLIENT: Well I did. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: [And maybe you can prolong this thing.] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah, it was, it was you know.
COUNSELOR: But I guess what I'm saying is...you do like her... 
CLIENT: Oh, yeah, I like her.
COUNSELOR: ...you know why not see her? I don't mean to, I don't want to talk you into anything.
CLIENT: Yeah, oh yeah, I can understand, I mean you're not nothing that stops me I mean I enjoy your company too well.
COUNSELOR: Yes.
CLIENT: You know.
COUNSELOR: And there's no... [inaudible at 0:12:32.2] ...like we've been just talking about this and...in talking...since the last time you've thought about...and the opportunities to better yourself...like...like your thought is that you're always ready to [cut to meat of the thing] (ph)... 
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...and you hadn't been with a girl.
CLIENT: That's true, that's true but... 
COUNSELOR: So my job to you, you've always to and you know... 
CLIENT: After one you'd be left with... (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:12:54.6] ...basically without any other choice.
CLIENT: Right, right.
COUNSELOR: Well I don't think because of...and I don't think it's because of the hour in here in your therapy...because...it's really something and you've had lots of girls worry you. [0:13:08.0]
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: And...the...like I guess a real big phase is...is you really like this girl.
CLIENT: Yeah, I did, I really enjoyed it.
COUNSELOR: And she did too. 
CLIENT: Yes. So at any rate (chuckling) like I said, when she comes back from the Bahamas I don't know what's going to happen. But like, and...then that word marriage is frightening me. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Well, yeah, I can understand that but it's just...I mean she's at all reasonable...she could understand that you can't tell her tomorrow or in a week that you... 
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: ...can't really get married.
CLIENT: Well I hope. (chuckling) [Leave it all leading to.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: When she said that thing about being more sensitive, did that kind of frighten you or make you unsure about what to do or if you want this woman?
CLIENT: I don't know. No, I don't think so, no.
COUNSELOR: No?
CLIENT: She isn't (ph).
COUNSELOR: How do you feel about speaking your piece?
CLIENT: Yeah, it's...okay. And she says...she, but she kind of suggested it...and I said, "Well not here." Or something like that...I said, "Well, I mean in good time." Or something like that...and I was just...fine...but then again with, I've known her for a long time...and I, I, just like I said... 
COUNSELOR: You're not supposed to do that?
CLIENT: Yeah, right. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: But there's this, I mean like could you see yourself sleeping with her?
CLIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: And not feeling any love for the following thing, close to I mean... 
CLIENT: I don't know, that's just it, that's a question mark. That's why I said...not now. (chuckling) You know, I don't know if I could or without...feeling that way or without feeling the fact that now how she would feel...wondering how she would feel, more like, like now that she's slept with me...'okay, now we can get married' or something like this, you know. [0:15:16.8]
COUNSELOR: You'd like to know what it would mean from her point of view.
CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, you know. Sometimes...I'm, I know she has marriage on her mind you know.
COUNSELOR: A lot of women do.
CLIENT: Really. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: You know but I guess...I guess, I guess...in terms of sleeping with her, it's like maybe you do feel like you want to do it and you're not sure how you feel.
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: And you might feel bad if it presents (ph) you badly... 
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...and it might mean to her a green light for marriage and not to you.
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: But...it's kind of like, don't shut it off because of those things, I mean...there are... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...plenty of people and some of them good Catholics as well... [overlapping voices at 0:16:00.5]
CLIENT: I know, (chuckling) people who are set with. (chuckling) But like I...I wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want to hurt her...because I really, I really love her, you know... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...like for really a close friend...and I wouldn't want to hurt her. Because we've done a lot of things together and she's done a lot of things for me.
COUNSELOR: You know some of the best relationships start out platonically and then...they really do because they have...are really strong to build on, you know what I mean, and it sounds like to me you do have a lot...to begin with here.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know and the fact that you enjoy each other's company and really you're totally compatible.
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] But it isn't...it's that...not that we don't, there aren't arguments or things like this... 
COUNSELOR: Sure.
CLIENT: ...but she's a very strong person...and a very, I don't know if I'd use creative or just more or less...I can do anything...she's independent also, we just kind of conflict right then and there...and she, like she wants, she likes, she likes to do things for me but...I'd rather do it myself sort of thing...and then she feels, she says, "Just because I do this for you, don't think that you owe me this." Or stuff like that...and I don't like...people doing things for me when I can do it myself. (chuckling) It's the principle of doing it by myself you know. I walk in my apartment and she had these curtains and things like that...and I'm supposed to respond and she helped me paint and stuff like that. But...and she just - and I don't know, sometimes that it's more one of basically like friends, said something like, he said something to her about, 'now that I've done...' 
COUNSELOR: Was it Katie? [0:17:44.4]
CLIENT: I think it was Katie, hopefully Katie, it might have been mine - I don't know anyone, one of them said something like, 'now that' he said something like, 'now that she's done all this,' you know for me...helped me get my apartment together and all this stuff...that, 'he kind of turned me off,' or something like this...this is where we got into that hassle about, 'well, I'm a threat to you,' came up...so...and like I told her, I said...that was also when, oh, I didn't call sometimes...like usually...when you'd always be going out on the weekends on Friday night, and when was it, one, it was one Friday night and - I can't remember - at any rate, there was, it was, it was during the winter, it was very cold, and like I said, oh, it was the week of, it was the week of the teacher's strike and I had been picketing all week at the school and like the meetings and...so I'd been picketing all week, and she worked on the high school so they've got a lot more picketers, so they have I mean...more picketers over there. So I'd been picketing like all week...and I hadn't seen her all week and she'd been to the... [inaudible at 0:19:19.8] ...going crazy. And then Friday night came along and she said something about doing something and I said, "Okay, what do you want to do?" And she's, "Ah, I don't know." And so I said, "You know there's really not much to do." We just called out and stuff like this...and then she got all upset because she, I wouldn't go out there... [inaudible at 0:19:39.1] So at any rate, my niece was in the hospital that weekend too, so I came over to see her over here... [inaudible] ...so I came over here and saw her, met (ph) with her, and I came back home and Tanya called up again and said that...like, "Where were you?" And I said, "Well I was at the hospital." And she said, "Well you could've invited me to come along." And I said, "What's the big deal...why didn't you, why would you come all the way, from Madison all the way up to Chicago to go to the hospital." You know. She just, "Well don't..." Something, I don't know what she said then. Then she hung up and then she called back again and said, "Do you still want to go out?" And I said, "You know it's kind of late." And she hung up again. Then she called back again (chuckling) and she says, "Do you mind if I come over?" I said, "No, come right over." So then she came over and we watched television or something like that and the she said, "Well don't you want to know why I was mad?" And I said, "Okay." And she said, "Oh, you know that's..." I don't know if that was when she brought out...that... [0:20:42.5]
COUNSELOR: The threat.
CLIENT: ...the threat, yeah, something like that...but that was a big old hassle. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds like you've...it's like, I kind of sense like that she really does care for you... 
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...and you do care for her... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...but it's kind of like...you're problems about sex, in a way, have gotten in the way...
CLIENT: Right, right.
COUNSELOR: ...of anything measurable (ph).
CLIENT: That's it.
COUNSELOR: You know and it's kind of like...she does really want to be with you.
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: You know you do want to be with her, it's just that you have to put up this barrier in a way.
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: And that, and that's kind of what it sounds like is kind of like you're really drawn to her and you really...like being with her... 
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...but it's kind of like you get very tense and nervous... 
CLIENT: yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...when it comes to a kind of sexual involvement.
CLIENT: Right, right, yeah, that's it.
COUNSELOR: That's kind of like that's what...upsets her... 
CLIENT: Yes, it is.
COUNSELOR: ...and prevents...the relationship from...flowering somehow (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah, right. (chuckling) Like there was really no problem like...like when a few years ago like...when we had just met and...it's just there's a whole bunch of us...in college and things like going to parties and things like that...and everybody...like all the, most of the kids we had known...they're married and living out in the suburbs and things like that...and so it's kind of like the whole gang is broken up. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Right, I mean kind of like their competing (ph)... 
CLIENT: Yeah, right. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: ...but there is no, they're not...lovers usually.
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: But kind of like and also kind of like they'll let their values kind of like...the times that I sense like your old thing, like got to grow up now... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And really it sounds like, I sense wanting, nervous and scary though, right?
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: They're competing with their abilities.
CLIENT: Yeah, really. (chuckling) That's the truth. That's the truth.
COUNSELOR: And I guess that kind of just makes you feel kind of wooed (ph)?
CLIENT: Uh-huh, it did, it really did, I feel great. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: I imagine, yeah.
CLIENT: Really, it was great, it really was. I felt something like just...being touched it already (ph) seems like the time. (chuckling) I don't know.
COUNSELOR: And I guess it made you kind of nervous when you weren't just willing to assume that?
CLIENT: Uh-huh, right, right, (chuckling) sitting and just telling that. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you're saying it to me.
CLIENT: Sundays, so, Sunday night at dinner (ph), now that was an experience. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yes, but I guess I kind of...like I just, if you could say more about like...how it feels to be about maybe your solution with this, and at the same time and I'd like for you to see yourself doing it.
CLIENT: Yeah, right. I could see myself doing this and I can also, I also can feel myself having selfish motives... 
COUNSELOR: Just pretty dysfunctional (ph) like you mean? [0:23:52.3]
CLIENT: Yeah, right, yeah. And if I...just want to keep her to sleep with her for selfish motives...and then I think...well it's kind of rotten.
COUNSELOR: And then do you feel today you were just messing around with these selfish motives?
CLIENT: At first, yeah...but after a while, no. No. At first, yes. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: And kind of like if you slept with her you felt like your motivation was selfishly rude, you know?
CLIENT: Right. (chuckling) You know like that was...really kind of did everything bad. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah but...you, I guess...like what peoples' motives are is kind of for you a tricky business sometimes and then sometimes it's actually the road of happiness to be selfish but then they become fraught with pain. I mean not the motives I suppose but you find, oh my God...these aren't usual.
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: You know after you doing it, it might - well I'll tell you it's like you said, like initially when you said it me...these are thoughts that are selfish, you didn't know. But only if you had said it's... [inaudible at 0:25:02.4] ...when you sleep with her you're supposed to be...you master real easy how you feeling, good enough!
CLIENT: Yeah. You know I guess with a clean sigh. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: I guess we're trained to...you took...let yourself have some leeway... 
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...in your...at times don't really do yourself that...I'm talking about, sure she's got feelings.
CLIENT: Yeah, really, right.
COUNSELOR: Do you see what I mean?
CLIENT: Right, uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Well you know that sometimes you don't really or at least part of you is likely going to feel tension to do this you know?
CLIENT: Right. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: I mean and even if it's someone you know.
CLIENT: Right, (chuckling) part of me does though (chuckling) but...I've done... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...something right. I understand what you're saying...but, no, I, I can, like I said, I can see myself sleeping with her...and in fact I hope it's a probability. But like I said... 
COUNSELOR: Well it certainly sounds like...well, well I don't know how she feels about it but it's not, I mean...I mean she may...find that...or she may feel very moral about it too now...you know.
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: And...I mean in that sense you shouldn't feel rejected, just like you're in the same boat in a way... 
CLIENT: That's, yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...and now you have something to work through together.
CLIENT: That's true and that, yeah. She...like with, with her outlook on the whole thing we do, I, I, I'm...she's not the type of girl that's going to sleep with...anybody. [0:26:53.3]
COUNSELOR: Anyone.
CLIENT: Yeah...she's just as bad with anything I do. Except I don't, I really, I'm doubtful if she, she probably has never slept with anybody before...I'm a pretty freaky fellow who is still a virgin. And, but I...she knows because...she's real into modesty and all this stuff...so.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: But I don't know for her what her motives are, if they're selfish, she might hide it. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Well...calling your motives selfish is...you never do something... [inaudible at 0:27:26.4] ...if there weren't attempts (ph) made to you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So insofar as...any, anything that...it sounds selfish and if you want to call it that. You know what I mean?
CLIENT: Because that explains you're sensitive, yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know but calling it selfish is, is a very gray way to look at it. I mean like calling something selfish is if you really just abuse people so you can get pleasure. You know people get married as motive because it helps...[getting married] (ph), something that will make them happy and make the other person happy and that's how the relationship works and that's how life works.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know, people do things to give other people pleasure, I mean and it doesn't have to be because it was selfish. I mean does that make a little sense to you?
CLIENT: Yeah, uh-huh, right. I can understand what you're saying. Take me, just by the fact that...both are getting pleasure from it...and it doesn't make it feel really selfish then.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean if... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...and...what I'm saying is you've opened, you're making it so that both of you got pleasure.
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: So that you shouldn't be saying, 'I'm being selfish.' She says, 'I'm being selfish' just hoping you'll say, 'I'm being selfish.'
CLIENT: Yeah, really, (chuckling) no.
COUNSELOR: No, and that's what we'd like to document on these type things with people giving motives and then you started questioning it
CLIENT: Yeah, that's true, that's the case.
COUNSELOR: And now two of these people are going through something that hasn't brought them together sometimes is untrue, she was really just dating you socially.
CLIENT: Yeah, I can understand that now, really.
COUNSELOR: So you've kind of...gotten this?
CLIENT: Yeah. But then of course...like she doesn't have the same sex hang-ups that I do...and that's looking at, as an outlook, not as far as the pleasure aspect is concerned but as far as the future.
COUNSELOR: Future... 
CLIENT: Yeah, before... 
COUNSELOR: ...[is concerned.] (ph) [0:29:27.9]... 
CLIENT: Yeah, and like the future... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, she made, her motivation kind of or...she agreed that there's something to do with future or to happiness... 
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: ...maybe. I don't know if you see it that way but you're not thinking about that quite as much...
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...you know, [now through your conscious you want for you to be in depression.] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, two different things. (chuckling) Two different things. You know and there are...like personal (chuckling) - getting back to the subject I mean, and there are times when I tend to...I, I, like it would really be hard for me to live with a person all my life...really. (chuckling) And I think to myself...like wow, I just...sometimes people just get in my way, you know? [0:30:17.9]
COUNSELOR: I know.
CLIENT: They just...I'd like...to be alone...and they just, and when you're living with a person you're never really alone again, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like you don't have...like the thing you're saying, it's truly just, you're married, you're living someone and it's like you don't have your own apartment... [overlapping voices at 0:30:38.7]
CLIENT: Right, it's not safe (ph).
COUNSELOR: ...instead like you had to lose and going to lose... 
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...[like destiny maybe a little.] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah, that's about it. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: But...it's like...this, it is this...need for you to want someone... [inaudible at 0:30:52.1]
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] It's a lot (chuckling) but it's... 
COUNSELOR: But it's also...the other side of it is like, it's a choice...the other side of it is like, when you're saying, telling me, when you're telling...things are obviously a lot better off.
CLIENT: Yeah, right, that's the truth, that's the truth. (chuckling) Because I just, I looked, I was looking to Yule Brenner, he was on David Song's (ph) show, and he said that one of his philosophies were that, 'you come into the world alone and you lived in the world alone and go out of the world alone and that any relationship or any friendship that you have with a person is a gift'. And I don't find that. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And he said...'it should never be taken...for granted', like you know
COUNSELOR: Right, right. And I guess what you feel is kind of like it's a gift and do I want to, I can see that I can possibly have these gifts, do I want to...push the gift away?
CLIENT: Right, right, (chuckling) that's it. You know it's just your choice. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it's, and it's, I sometimes sense it is a hard choice for you because...you don't know... 
CLIENT: Really.
COUNSELOR: ...about where...it's going...so that's a historically (ph) big thing... 
CLIENT: Really. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: ...but ultimately you'd just like to just live alone?
CLIENT: Live alone, yeah, that's the truth but you can't have one without the other...you just can't have both! (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah...and...and people...people get married...they do have times alone, I mean the amount is the person they really need today, you know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And so we go out with the boys...all that... 
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...you, in a way something that would not be patient is...though if...you may not be alone, it's something that's yours...your future. I mean I'm not sure, I mean what I'm saying is that living with someone isn't a 24-hour... 
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: ...you know?
CLIENT: Yeah, like when you have someone with you all the time
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: Yeah, I can understand that. (chuckling) Well it's a good part of the day, you know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, it would be for your routine. [0:33:11.1]
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] I don't know, it's just all the divorce I guess. (chuckling) I don't know, it's strange, really strange. That's like when...even as far as holding a myriad of concerns, I, I'm kind of, I'm glad that I didn't get married when I was 18 or anything like that...and I'm, and I have, at least I have a question mark in my mind now...and what's going to happen in the future I don't know...yes or no, I don't know, I may wait till I'm 30 or 40 or something, I don't know. (chuckling) I'm Irish and the Irish men get married late, more. (chuckling) [inaudible at 0:34:04.4]... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it's a question mark for you... 
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...and it still is, but somehow it's kind of like, I kind of get the sense that you feel like, well I mean even...towards mentally more about what I want... 
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...and I'm not avoiding it.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's the truth.
COUNSELOR: Meaning I do see...I don't rule out a possibility or anything like that, yet.
CLIENT: You know, not really.
COUNSELOR: When you say, 'not really', well you just couldn't, I mean so you kind of agreed with me so [really nothing is impossible?] (ph) [inaudible at 0:34:41.8]
CLIENT: Yeah, I can, you know. [She could live with me.] (ph) She, she got upset...like, like I said I live alone and I called, live out...in McLean in the suburbs...then it was like two years ago and the neighborhood has turned all black and they're living in the neighborhood and it's all black and six or seven, six years before I moved out...my parents were moving out to the suburbs and I said, "Well I'm not going to go, you know, go ahead." So it was kind of nice (ph)...
COUNSELOR: What, you mean before they were committed here?
CLIENT: Yeah, just, well they were selling the house...and they said...that they were selling the house and I said, "Well I don't want to move out to the suburbs." And I said, "I want to stay in the city." And they said, you know, "Why?" And all this stuff and I said, "Well I just, you know, it's my choice and I don't want to move out there." You know, so it was kind of nice that...it wasn't, there wasn't any big hassle about moving out or anything. They were moving... 
COUNSELOR: They were kind of tame at this point, right?
CLIENT: Yeah, right, (chuckling) tame as in being unkind. They were moving and I decided I just didn't want to move with them...and they were kind of upset at first I think...asking me why and all this stuff. So they, they moved...I'd, the relationship kind of changed...when I moved out and there were four of us then, an older sister and she lived near my parents and she with Joey and then I have, then there's myself and I have a younger brother who is a year and a half younger than I am and a younger sister who is five years younger than I am. And my brother had been in the service...in Nam, he's away at school at Western (ph), and my sister is in nursing school in Pennsylvania, my other sister, because there's nobody home...they're all alone, and so I probably see them...at least once every two weeks...or once a week, I mean...so I'd go some weekends or something like that. And like I said...it was like it started to really change, going into the house and...do you want anything...it changed things. And oh, it's...like they'd just...do anything for me...it's really weird. (chuckling) But it's kind of nice and I think I'm getting to know them better and they're getting to know me better...on these infrequent visits than when I was living with them, because they could never accept my ideas and they were just... [0:37:29.3]
COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of like you get along better now that you're not living with them?
CLIENT: Yeah, right, really, now that we don't see one another that often...and it's really (ph) - once in a while when I was looking and I was going off, it was high school and college...all that stuff, it was, there were arguments...and things like that and my father would...get all upset or...and he thought I was blaspheming (ph) or if there was something and he didn't really seem to like it, I got to the point where I didn't say anything...because of his quotes (ph). But now it's really kind of nice. But, like I said, I go out there...once a week or once every two weeks or something like that and well just once and once in a while...I get this, Tanya will give a crack like, "Well, say hello to your folks now." Or something like this you know.
COUNSELOR: And it made you kind of mocking your close relationship with them?
CLIENT: Yeah, right, right...and it really kind of unnerved me...and I figure like... 
COUNSELOR: Now maybe she kind of needs understanding between you and her?
CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Well.
CLIENT: But...like it, it really kind of...really just, she lives with her mom in her... 
COUNSELOR: Oh.
CLIENT: ...and her father had died about six or seven years ago something like that...she was really close with her dad. But, and...she's just kind of hung up out there and just because I enjoy going to my parents' house maybe, I don't know (chuckling) and she doesn't like... 
COUNSELOR: You know what if she kind of does that mocking thing she's kind of being... 
CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah, it seems like, "Well, who the hell are you to knock my parents?" You know if I want to go see them I'm going to go see them.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and you kind of, you really like the way that your relationship is with your parents.
CLIENT: Yeah, right, I do...and I don't mind...I really like going out there, you know.
COUNSELOR: And you see what's really... [overlapping voices at 0:39:18.4]
CLIENT: I don't see anything wrong with it.
COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... 
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...if it's this... [inaudible]... 
CLIENT: Really. Because I like going to see my parents...I'm just feeling like I should not hang around with her...but she gets kind of hung up on that. (chuckling) But I just...I, I just kind of let it pass over which is the thing to do, I just...more or less say, "Well..." you know to her, "...shut your goddamn mouth." (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Well maybe...I don't know. I guess...there are ways of...you could get angry at her, what you get after, why does it bother her...that you could say, 'shut your goddamn mouth'... 
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...you know is one way and that you're kind of committing to life (ph)...that to be seeing like...or you could try to understand... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...why she feels that way.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.
COUNSELOR: You know I mean like...you can I guess like...there, like when she does things that bother you then you can, you can ask her about them.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know that can lead to a better understanding about her.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know like...like maybe talking about how she feels about sleeping with you and you feel about sleeping with her is something maybe you can resolve the way it is, you know? [0:40:30.3]
CLIENT: Cool.
COUNSELOR: You know it all doesn't have to be unsaid. 
CLIENT: Yeah, really. (chuckling) Really. But, yeah, it was the last time she said something like that. I don't know if this was, oh, I think it was my mother's birthday or something like that I think, and I was, it was a Friday night, yeah, right. So she's probably just presumed that I was going to my mother's, of course I'm going to my mother's...everybody, it's my mother's birthday and I'm going out to see my mother. (chuckling) So she said something like, "say happy birthday to your mother", and left...and then got out of the car, so that...I really didn't, there was nothing, I didn't have time to say anything.
COUNSELOR: [So there was nothing, for you I mean to handle this?] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah, it did...it totally did...and I thought...I, and...she got out and slammed the door and that was that, but I thought...she really didn't give me an opportunity to say anything back to her! (chuckling) You know I just didn't have an opportunity to say anything, even after a while...so I thought, okay. (chuckling) So, that was the last date that I remember. (chuckling) But, at any rate. [silence from 0:41:57.2 to 0:42:06.6] It was a nice birthday. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: And you need to rationalize (ph) that through a kind of a throwing a dart I mean at it, it probably satisfies you.
CLIENT: (chuckling) Because, oh, well, like...she tries to, she really enjoys doing things with me...and the thing with - oh, I remember one time, this is the conflict about her, and - what was that, what'd I just detect? (chuckling) At any rate, she said something about doing things together...and I said, "I want to do things with other people...I want to go out and meet other people." And I she, and I said, "You know, well why don't - you know you can do the same thing." I said, "We don't have to go out every weekend, you know." I said, "You know I want to go out with other people...not just with you, you know." So she says, "But I enjoy going out with you, you know." And I said, "Well, I don't know, I just, I want to go out with other people." I said, "Don't count on me every weekend...calling up and saying let's go some place or let's do something." And I said, "If you've got something to do go ahead...and do it, you know." I said, "I'm not going to be all upset because you go out and do something, you know." And she said, "Well I tried it once." And I said, "Oh, yeah." And she said, "Yeah, at Kelly's." "Oh," I said, "when was that?" And she said, "Oh, it was the night I went up to this friend", that she wanted to see at Jessie's house, and he lives on Rush (ph). And she said, "And you..." Oh, and she just then, "I had a shitty, shitty time and you went out and you met Katie and went to visit this..., so I never met him." A friend of ours who was working at the funeral home...we had a party there. (chuckling) [0:43:49.4]
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And...it was just like...we went and we visited the embalming room and looked at what she does and lied in this casket and things like that...and she says, "You had a hell of a good time with out me!" And I said, "Right." And she says, "But I didn't, you know." She said, "I would've had much rather been with you, doing what...with you, you know." And she was, and I said, "Yeah, I can understand it." And she said, "You know if you can remember, I just can't go out alone...like you can." She's like, "I can't...go out and sit at a bar and be alone like you can...and meet people like you can...this is because I am a woman...and it's not acceptable." (chuckling) And I said, "Yes, this is true and I really sorry for you, but..."
COUNSELOR: Right. Maybe if...you wanted to just be with her all the time and she thinks about it.
CLIENT: Yeah, right...it's just, I was, I was in just like one of my moods or something - I don't know, I just didn't want to...I, I wanted to go out and meet other people...and like I just wanted to do other things... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...with other people.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: I was getting kind of tired it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. You wanted to be away from her?
CLIENT: Yeah, well (chuckling) that was, that was one of the times. (chuckling) And I thought, another...like being, when I'm feeling omitted (ph)...you couldn't get away from it, I mean you couldn't get away from your wife very well.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like before this time really Tanya [then bars] (ph) you from random (ph) visits but then Tanya revolves (ph) around you... 
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...[in it now.] (ph)
CLIENT: Really. I remember it well quitting (ph) when I was, when we were younger and my father used to go out every single night...every night, and he always went to one particular tavern...all the time...oh, and the hassle it's time to fight (chuckling) and...and my mother would say, "You know don't." And...so she really would get upset...and, "When you go there are always big fights." You know and all this stuff. And God, I remember it's all...I can kind of remember the tavern number (ph) but I can't, and it's...I used to have it memorized. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: You mean like getting calls... [overlapping voices at 0:46:24.1]
CLIENT: Yeah, if they called and asked for him...all the time, ask them to see if you can get your father on the phone (chuckling) tell him to get home and dinner is ready...(chuckling) but that all changed, it was funny, after it was kind of, it was sad after my older sister got married he never went out again. (chuckling) [0:46:47.9]
COUNSELOR: How do you mean?
CLIENT: You know he just didn't go out at all you know.
COUNSELOR: Do you mean that when he did times it was usual?
CLIENT: Yeah, because he realized that...his kids have all been grown up and he missed it and it was all gone you know.
COUNSELOR: [And there was a feeling before him, you were gone while he was in the tavern?] (ph)
CLIENT: Uh-huh, yeah, while he was in the tavern...and we were, we were all grown up and he missed it.
COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:47:08.5]... 
CLIENT: Well I was in high - I don't know, I can't remember now. I must have been out of high school, I must - I was in college. Let me think. My brother was in the latter part of high school and my younger sister so she must have been, she was in high school too. And it was like...my, my younger sister was the one who really kind of suffered for it because he was always...and then he stayed home. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And she would get hell from him when she used to come home late because he was there then. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.
CLIENT: But it was really, it was kind of sad...it was really kind of sad, I used to...really resent it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, resent the fact that he was at that bar... [overlapping voices at 0:47:44.9]
CLIENT: Resent that he wasn't there. Oh, God...it used to really piss me off and...even all of us I think resented it...all four of us really kind of, we were really kind of bitter towards [the whole thing.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: In part the role for your father is [now to get dignified.] (ph)
CLIENT: Right, right...and it was really kind of bad. And in fact I remember one Christmas there was a, it was a Christmas morning, and we had gotten up...and my father wasn't there, and I guess he must have gone out earlier that day to the tavern or something and we woke up and he wasn't there. Well he came home soon after...and he wasn't drunk or loaded, he must have had one or one drink maybe, and he wasn't there but...that did it. My mother laid into him right at the door...and we were just sitting there, and there it went, Christmas, right out the window (chuckling)...and it really, at that time it really meant something just...to us kids.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean Christmas...that's what Christmas is... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...it's a family day... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...it's kind of a time where the family gets together and it's kind of the epitome of family... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...and it's... 
CLIENT: Even I remember going to church on confirmations, he'd be half loaded going into church (chuckling)...oh, Christ! It was really bad.
COUNSELOR: It sounds to me like you have a lot of angry feelings, like that you're kind of angry and resentful about him... [inaudible at 0:49:04.3]
CLIENT: Yeah, but...I can't feel, I...now can't feel angry or resentful toward him.
COUNSELOR: Kind of, I mean I get a sense of how it's really sad that...how it was with him.
CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, yeah, because...like I said, he stopped...the only time he ever drinks is on weekends, (chuckling) which is really weird and he doesn't go out, he stays home...and he drinks, which is really weird, which is really kind of bugging my mother now because she wants to go out. She has no kids...we're all gone, she's ready, you know. "I did my bit, okay, let's go!" And he doesn't want to, (chuckling) which is really kind of hard for her...she's dying to get out and go but he's just like turned over a new leaf in one day and it was just unbelievable, (chuckling) just unreal...just unreal. In fact I remember when we were still living over on, in the old place, and my teacher was living out in the suburbs and we went out there for something, my, I think my mother, my mother was babysitting and I had to pick her up that was it, so, and came back and I don't know how the subject got started and something about loving my father...and I said, "I really, I really can't see how my father loves me." You know, I said, "I cannot understand it." You know. And I said, "All the time that he had gone to that tavern...and when we, when he should've been at home...and all this stuff." And all this...that...that he, because I can't even remember, I said, "I can't even remember him ever embracing us, you know." And she says, "Well you know this isn't your father." I said, "I know." And she pointed out that there other ways that he showed his love...and there are things that he used to, oh, anytime, anything you needed fixing...he'd fix it us. [0:50:57.2]
COUNSELOR: Kind of like, I guess in the way kids understand loving is them to be basing... 
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: ...you couldn't feel but you can kind of understand now... 
CLIENT: Now, yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...his way of showing love is to fix something for you.
CLIENT: Fix something or build something for us...he'd build us, oh, little orange-crate scooter carts...
COUNSELOR: Scooter carts, yeah.
CLIENT: ...and, oh, build some...at first...it's things he'd build us...and, and stuff like that...and she said, "This is the way he shows his love...that he's willing to give you." And then I...actually find I'm really sorry I didn't understand it then, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and then...if you hung out, just to depart his wisdom kind of thing.
CLIENT: Yeah, so... it's... 
COUNSELOR: Growing up the kid doesn't have the sophistication to figure this out... [overlapping voices at 0:51:39.6]
CLIENT: That's it, really.
COUNSELOR: ...that...that some people can't show love the way you want them to... 
CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...and their way that showing us could be by building things.
CLIENT: Yeah, right, right. (chuckling) Like this is...this is just saying...she, too, is upset that I said it...and then I said, "I'm sorry but this is the way it was." You know she was really hurt with the way I said it...like. And, but...now I kind of understand it...in fact...he's always, he's always just doing things for me now, it's unbelievable.
COUNSELOR: Well we've got to stop [for today.] (ph)
CLIENT: Okay. [0:52:27.0]
