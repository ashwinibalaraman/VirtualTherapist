(00:01:05)
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: It's freezing out there.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it's cold.
CLIENT: A little icy too. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_2042');">[note]</a><div id="_note_2042" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Psychoanalytic clinicians pay close attention to how the patient begins the session. We wonder how the patient's initial comments reflect of their internal/ emotional state. For example, if they talk about the difficult traffic getting to the office, the therapist might think about internal obstacles the patient may be experiencing in treatment. In this case, "A" comments that it is freezing outside, so I wonder how coldness relates to her inner state. What becomes apparent shortly is how "A" wonders if she is cold toward others, and whether she can be, in a sense emotionally "icy".</b></div> So I felt like yesterday I was thinking a lot about me ... thinking about people like me inconveniencing them verses good feelings. It really kind of made me sad because I was thinking like how it could like affect my relationships with people and like if I'm not, I guess in touch with that and my conversation with them I just may not get it. Or like sometimes when Jamie and I bicker. Or I'll be like, "Yeah, (inaudible_00:02:04) you're mean." Like kind of joking around and then he'll be like, "Well you're mean too but it's not about the things you say. It's the things like you don't say." And then that kind of makes me look like ... I don't know. I think in general it (inaudible_00:02:18) unsympathetic sometimes. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_3383');">[note]</a><div id="_note_3383" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A"'s opening comments about the weather come to bear on what she is now talking about. She's wondering if she acts coldly toward others.</b></div> Or I just don't know what to say. And it's like I kind of feel bad but I don't even think to say things sometimes. But like that's kind of ties in a little bit to like not thinking about what someone else may feel and just worrying about it's being saved or you using up like one freebie or I don't know. So it's kind of like, "Why didn't I identify it?" But bummed that it's there. Yeah.
(00:03:00)
CLIENT: But then I feel like I'm like really guilty because like when you said that like yesterday, like you know, "Do you think I would be bummed because we couldn't meet?" then I like felt bad. So like I don't ...
THERAPIST: Felt bad about me?
CLIENT: Yeah. It sounded like, "Ah well she's bummed because we couldn't meet. Like that makes me a little sad." But I feel like I had like extra guilt. But sometimes it's maybe not even necessary because of you. Like I just - I feel like guilty thinking about like the scheduling aspect of it. Maybe I should've been thinking more about like the feelings too. But, I don't.
THERAPIST: So you've been wondering about me? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_4666');">[note]</a><div id="_note_4666" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>When appropriate and with the right timing, psychoanalytic clinicians encourage patients to talk about their feelings about the treatment or the therapist.</b></div>
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like on some level. But it's not my first ... like my first thought. I just like ... I just like thinking of just like or like situations that are (inaudible_00:04:10) like go to a wedding over the summer and I felt like more in head, like I was, "Oh, they just can save ... I wasn't very close to the person, I'm like, "Oh they can just save money on the plate. I'm not going anyway, it doesn't matter." Verses more thinking like, "Oh maybe they'll be upset that I'm not going." Or I can't like find other examples now. But like it's like when you said that I couldn't hit the nail on the hammer because I think that I do think like that a lot. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_5527');">[note]</a><div id="_note_5527" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>This is a sign of progress when the patient directly takes up what the therapist says and uses it as a way of better understanding herself. At this point in the treatment, the therapeutic process is a productive one.</b></div>
(00:04:44)
CLIENT: It's an embarrassing thing. I think I need to start being more alert, but I don't know how to get like in tune with those feelings. So ... (00:05:03_Inaudible) kind of at loss of what to do.
THERAPIST: Well that's good because if you knew what to do it wouldn't be unknown or uncharted territory. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_6118');">[note]</a><div id="_note_6118" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I made this comment for two reasons. First, as a general principle, patients need to be encouraged to take risks and tolerate uncertainty. The reason people come to therapy is that they gravitate to their familiar ways of thinking and being which aren't working for them. Second, for "A" in particular, she has little tolerance for not having "the answer" so I'm suggesting that she allow herself to be okay for the time being with not knowing.</b></div>
CLIENT: Right. I guess it comes to like one little bit of frustration, I wish I had a road map just to get me there. (Sniffling) Just to get me there.
THERAPIST: whose roadmap would it be? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_6800');">[note]</a><div id="_note_6800" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I'm not sure why I asked this. I could have asked, "where would the road map take you?" I could have also responded to her anxiety about not having a roadmap, and said something like, "It's so hard for you not to have a clear direction."</b></div>
CLIENT: I don't know.
(00:05:41)
CLIENT: And then it feels like helps talking to like you or like a sensible friend that will like, like Jamie, but for them like when I'm having conversation with my parents like they're never going to say you know what you think about how I felt. That's like dad would be the one who would throw it in your face like. He wasted four hours and 'x' amount dollars. That's kind of where it was bred from but I don't know. I guess it's like being around insensitive people too. But I feel like my first in line of thought is to think like that.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
(00:06:25)
THERAPIST: So your mind goes to your thinking would what your parents would welcome in. So maybe ...
CLIENT: Like I feel like it's almost like ignorance is bliss. Like I've never had anyone at least say like, "You're going to think about it like this?" And so years and years of like my parents and their responses it just, I don't know. I just you know. It's like this huge thing to get by. And then I feel like I should probably come, I don't know, maybe a bad connection but just come naturally. And it doesn't or didn't at least in that scenario yesterday and (inaudible_00:07:25). I'm just thinking more of like we're talking about me like using like my freebie and like sounds like I'm imposing on people. Actually that ... I don't know gives an aspect of my life that really, I don't want to say like, sets me back or but I feel like it's an area that like, I don't know I can identify with frequently.
THERAPIST: Would it ... When did the freebie come up?
CLIENT: I'm just saying like, I give an example of my boss, I actually asked my boss for an extensions.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And then I felt like I could never do it again.
THERAPIST: Right. And I said you only get one freebie.
CLIENT: Right.
(00:08:13)
CLIENT: But I think that I really do feel like that. Like if I ... like when I cancelled the appointment even I felt like "I have to go to every single appointment ever now. I could never cancel again." Which I mean stuff comes up sometimes and maybe, you know it will happen. And just I think a lot of things like that. Anytime I guess there's something new like ... that I think I was late in, I'm just like, "Need to fix this so it never, ever happens again." I feel like it's (inaudible_00:08:47) it's like extreme almost. Yeah. I like to work on that because I don't think that's the way to work. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_9644');">[note]</a><div id="_note_9644" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" feels that relationships are so brittle that they can come undone if someone makes requests or expresses needs. She feels people in relationships can easily feel imposed upon. If her boss grants her one extension, she will feel imposed upon if "A" asks for another. "A" has also expressed feeling imposed upon by others. This could have been a good opportunity to highlight this point.</b></div> Because I feel at work and then like I don't want (inaudible_00:09:07) and like I'm negative about communicating what my priorities are, I'm like working extra hard and stressed or maybe there'll be mistakes and I think if I just had openly said to my boss like, depends on what the situation is and you know how do you want me proceed, I think I'd better than me just not saying anything and trying to everything. And stressing out because I feel like need like just my one pass. I don't know why I feel like that. If it was like part of my upbringing but I felt like it's gotten worse since as I get older. And I feel like I get more guilty. It's like (inaudible_00:09:55).
(00:10:03)
CLIENT: I don't know how to work on like any of this. I feel like it's a little bit ... (sniffling) But I don't think it's like a sense of like, I do ... like I don't want to go and say like, and "I can't finish this assignment by this day." But at the end of the day it almost looks worse to like didn't communicate that, it was something daily anyways. I think there's something like an embarrassment factor too.
THERAPIST: And you're embarrassed by?
CLIENT: Just like not being successful at that task or not being able to find a way to make here or ... maybe it would be both. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_11370');">[note]</a><div id="_note_11370" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" is talking about her anxiety around need. "A" is invested in being self-sufficient and not asking others for help. She doesn't want to depend on others and finds the idea of doing so "embarrassing" and I would add shameful. As she continues to talk about this, I address this with her in this session.</b></div>
(00:11:03)
CLIENT: I don't know what to do with my (inaudible_00:11:10).
(Pause)
CLIENT: Any suggestions?
THERAPIST: No. What kind of suggestion would you like?
CLIENT: I don't know. How I could, I guess relieve my stress a little better or find a way to like balance with not being guilty and then, I don't know, like communicating whatever needs to be said. Or just, I don't know. And I think like a lot of its like I never want to ask for help or I'm dealing with private issue going back kind of ties into whenever like, like I'm honest, but how honest. Just kind of figure out myself and I'll, you know work on it really, really hard but then, you know, ten hours before my appointment that's when I'm like finally like realizing that there's no other people to make it better. My assignment it's not going to be in at work and then there's ... and then I feel like annoyed and bummed at myself about its you have an appointment. I don't know how to balance that.
(00:12:41)
THERAPIST: So when you say, you know like maybe there's a way, like are you thinking like practical steps like first you think this, then you think that? Or like you take a deep breath ... like do you have a thought about what that would look like?
CLIENT: Well I feel like I think there should be that but in like reality, I'm like you know probably not. I don't think there's like a checklist like, "By a certain hour you don't think that you can do, you know." Like this, I don't like ... I don't know. I'm just like; I don't know what to do about that. I don't know maybe if I spent less time on like stressing and those feelings of guilt about things that I have forced onto myself they're a little more at peace. And I feel like mentioning like at work, like my first couple of sessions but people say, "What's wrong? You're really stressed out of your head or something." And I feel like I do, like constantly feel like, constantly just like trying to like ... I don't know like, guilt or how could I have done that better? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_13805');">[note]</a><div id="_note_13805" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>This is a recurrent theme for "A"–she feels she needs to live up to the perceived high expectations of others and of herself.</b></div> But it's almost like it's like it's obsessive. Then I feel like (inaudible_00:14:13) in terms of like it could be work or it could be like my personal relationships. If I just like, "Okay, look, that one went bad. Like let's move on." I spend more time moving around like next task or things to handle verses kind of drilling on. Feeling bad about whatever (inaudible_00:14:32).
THERAPIST: If you weren't obsessing what would you be thinking about? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_14419');">[note]</a><div id="_note_14419" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I find this question useful for patients who report obsessing. Often, their responses are very helpful.</b></div>
CLIENT: I'd feel guilty how I could do it differently next time. Why maybe something went wrong; that feeling that more that went wrong and I let it go wrong. I guess I feel just like ... I'm like really personally responsible for, I don't know like ... I don't know if it goes into like a control. Because if I take all of the like ... like heat for something ... I don't know maybe semi-control even if it's like a failure and it's my control or something. (Pause)
(00:15:22)
CLIENT: I don't know why. And it's just like I'm filling in different things just that's gone to my head. I just ... like makes that unproductive. (Pause) Like yesterday, like I was working for a couple of hours like I was thinking about like this, like session or I'll think back to like situations with like I feel like when I ask for that extension it's like ... I'm just like, it's like still what's the use in talking about it. It's like; it's like at that time it's like the worst possible thing like I would have to do to like ask my boss. And then I feel like I'm constantly ... now if what I'm doing work it's just like, "How I do not make that happen again?" And then while I'm thinking about that I'm also thinking about like, "What went wrong back in November?" and feeling like bad that I had to ask my boss for an extension and in reality she probably doesn't care. Or maybe she does but I don't think she (pause) I don't know, I feel like growing up. But I was like if you did something wrong it was like held against you for life is like a harsh term. But like for a longtime and then anytime you are like disciplined or punished ... I know like as a kid, like obviously take something away like a toy or TV. I felt like it was always to just like to take something away. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_16348');">[note]</a><div id="_note_16348" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>It is striking how "A" quickly moves from her fear asking her boss something to being chastised as a kid. When patients associate to their childhoods after speaking of their current life, this is a sign that they are trying to increase self-understanding and make meaning of who they are and how they came to be that way. As an analytic therapist, I make a mental note of this, but I don't want to interrupt her to share this as she is in the midst of doing important work.</b></div>
(00:17:12)
CLIENT: Even like to this day like when my parents or if my dad is upset with me, like he doesn't communicate that he just like, kind of like takes something away. So like, "Okay, so how come ... how about you don't get a good Christmas gift this year?" I don't think it really correlates with you are upset about something but, okay. And so I feel like a little bit of ahead, like feel like at the worksite, like something is going to get taken away or it's like this like negative, like personal thing against me. And so if I want to do like everything in my absolute power. I think it's like not even so much about what you're taking away. It's like kind of like the ... I don't know what. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_17566');">[note]</a><div id="_note_17566" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" speaks about how punitive and retaliatory her father could be. Maybe the coldness she felt at the beginning of the session spoke to how she felt I would act toward her. That I would be cold and punitive in response to her having missed last week's sessions.] The embarrassment that goes along with it. It's like I don't care that my dad didn't give me a good Christmas gift. I wouldn't really care about getting it. But I do care that he like uses that to like hold it over my head and like if I don't like the outcome of this like you're going to get less or something. Like so I feel like I'm just trying to like ... I don't know ... overly compensate so that never happens. That make sense? [Typically when patient's ask if they are making sense, not an uncommon question, they are seeking connection or a feeling of understanding with the therapist.</b></div>
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: So ... I was thinking about that and then ... yeah, I don't know. And then I feel like sometimes like I recognize that on like some level. I feel like, well ... but it's like my boss going to like take away from me. But I feel like that kicks into like my extra like not having any emotions. So like just feeling like I have like my one freebie to use. Because like maybe she won't take something away, but maybe she'll be like ... I don't know, "I was really counting on you to get that completed. I'm a little bummed that it wasn't completed on time." Well look I don't even think those thoughts. I just think like that she's going to take something away and like recognize that she probably not going to act like that but I end up feeling more bad about like any like inconvenience I cause someone or ... (pause) <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_19315');">[note]</a><div id="_note_19315" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Here I could have asked what it feels like to think that someone will take something away. With this intervention, I would be exploring the emotion behind this thought.</b></div>
(00:19:43)
(Sniffling)
CLIENT: There's like a lot of ... I don't know like a lot of my like ... the way I act just comes from like really like making up experiences growing up. What it'd be like, you know like whether we're punished or ... I don't know if what if my dad just an exception, a negative person that, I don't know. And like the more I talk about like being under people's like control ... like I was just thinking of like, just like working for him and how I don't work for him anymore and like I laugh about it to like my brother and my friends like, "Ah it only took me whatever, ten years to get out or more, like fourteen years since I was working with him." But like it literally took me probably about eight years to stop like working for him. And I just feel like ... I don't know he would always use like, "I'll give you more money. How much money will it take for you to stay?" And I felt like, you know when you like need the money, like when you're in college or whatever like it's a nice incentive. But I don't know looking back at it now I'm like, "It's something that you just bribe everyone with money." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_20675');">[note]</a><div id="_note_20675" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" is talking about the power people have over her, either to punish her or to manipulate her to do things because she needs what they are have. This could have been a helpful comment to make.</b></div>
(00:21:11)
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: For like the topic I brought up yesterday or a couple of days ago because we were talking about my brother and my brother like not working and I would just say like, "Oh you should just go back to work with your dad because you made so much money there and you'd have to work double to, you know make that money anywhere else." But I'm like I kind of understand how it is because it's kind of like all or nothing. With my dad like you really just have to like cut all ties because he won't like ... well if he can't get what he wants, like he won't even help you which is really annoying. It's like if he can't get my brother to work seven days a week then he won't let my brother work like two or three days a week which doesn't make any sense. It's like more punishment. Yeah. It doesn't ... I don't know it just like upsets me.
(00:22:13)
THERAPIST: You got tearful before when we talked about you were embarrassed. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_21904');">[note]</a><div id="_note_21904" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Psychoanalytic therapists encourage patients to get deeper into feelings as a way to explore and understand them. Shame is an especially important feeling to understand as it can be painful and debilitating. This comment proves to be helpful as "A" uses it to explore her embarrassment.</b></div>
CLIENT: Yeah. Um, I know it just like sprung up like ... it was just like really like shameful. It's like you did something wrong. So ... and I, I don't know I think in my head I had must like ... and then it's like my own expectation but like you should just be ... I don't know you should do everything right. I know that I'm not wonderful but like I feel like I still get like upset with myself if I don't, so. Yeah. But it's funny because like ... I like to get feedback so it's never like if get ... this is where I start to think, "Like what if this high expectation is mine?" Because I feel like I really like seek out feedback, you know like a works inside. And it's almost like if I don't get feedback that I kind of like upset about it or like bummed I didn't get anything to work on. Like when I did my appraisals that I needed my extension for; it was my first time doing them and I was like hoping to get like a lot of good feedback and then the feedback was like ... I mean I did get a little bit of constructive feedback it wasn't just like 'Good job'. But in my head I don't know if I just didn't have like the confidence in what I was doing but I was like I was expecting ... I don't know, not an overhaul but like a lot. It's like I'm looking for that feedback to improve myself but yet I get really embarrassed when I feel like I can't do something. So I don't know how I can make sense of that.
(00:24:06)
CLIENT: So ... or maybe just coming in and asking for help because someone reaches out to like me to help me on something I'm fine with that. But to say like, "I'm lost. I don't know how to move forward on this." Or I feel like (inaudible_00:24:26) those, would I get embarrassed? Do you feel that? Because that's ... I never feel like ... from just like managing people I think there are some people who are like you give constructive feedback or ... and they just like they can't take it or they get really upset or just the fact that you had to give feedback was very upsetting and I don't feel like that work at all. But it's when I have to like initiate something I feel like it's ... I don't know like a failure of some sort (inaudible_00:25:03) that way. If I have all of these like  my own personal expectations just may not be realistic. Like when someone comes to me and says like, "I need help with this." It's like I'm more than happy to help. But I love doing things like that. So I don't think that's bad. My view is like everyone has to be perfect and complete on time and you know, know every answer. But for some reason when it's myself I just feel like that opposite.
(00:25:41)
(Pause)
CLIENT: I don't know why I have this expectation other than I just need it to be perfect. But I don't even know if the expectation is that it has to be perfect. I think the expectations is just like the, like ask for anything. (Blowing nose) And I kind of like, when I think of that it makes some sort of sense but I feel like I still haven't like totally made sense of like why I feel like that or able to ... it's like when I think of all like the reasons I think well, like, "that could be", that could be". ]It's like when you have like a lot of 'Aha' moments here and that 'Aha' moment hasn't come  yet. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Well you're not sure about what to do about leading.
CLIENT: Like I never want to have to lead.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: And I don't know if it's like I'm scared like if I like asked for help with them I would get a, I don't know, like a response that makes me feel bad or I don't know. I feel like that maybe could be it because I feel like, like if I have to ask something and I think that or talk about like when I make a decision I just feel like it has to be like this or like this. So there's like no in between or like I'm going to have a relationship with her or I'm not going to talk to them at all. And so I feel like when I have to ask a question and the answer could be something that I'm like putting myself up there on or like there's something at stake, I feel like I ... I feel like some questions that you know that the answer is going to positive. So if I feel like that it could be negative I'll prolong asking it for such a longtime until I feel like I'm prepared to deal with a negative response. And so then I feel like during that process I'm thinking a bunch of negative thoughts because I'm like preparing myself for the absolute worse. But really I almost convince myself that it will be the absolute worse. But I just don't want to ask it at all. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_26854');">[note]</a><div id="_note_26854" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" is talking about her fear of needing and depending on others. She doesn't like the feeling of being vulnerable so she shields herself from this feeling, like going into "prepare mode" "convincing myself of the absolute worse." This way, she feels, negative outcomes can't affect her.</b></div>
(00:28:15)
CLIENT: And then, yeah, at that point I feel like the situation is turned around and just not ... hasn't been looking for an outcome because so much time has passed. (Pause) So yeah, I think like the needing piece like for ... but I have to ask that question if I'm like scared that I may not like, like the answer and I don't know how to deal with it and then I won't ask the question until I feel like I know how to deal with it.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: So like back to like the work extension, I feel like I didn't ask for it until the absolute last minute because I was worried that she may say no even though looking back like I don't think anyone would say that. So like I worked up until a point where like if she said no like maybe I could pass it in. But at that point like I couldn't pass it in. So that I had to say something anyways. That was like not optimal outcome. But had I gone to her earlier, you know it would have been a little more positive. But I don't know why I feel the need to feel like I can't you know need anything. (Pause)
THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like you like the vulnerability that comes with it. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_28368');">[note]</a><div id="_note_28368" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I say this because think this lies at the heart of her issue.</b></div>
CLIENT: No.
(Pause)
CLIENT: Well I feel like, even with Jamie, when we've had talks about like our future or where the relationship's heading or at least you having ... look there are times that I didn't want to ask, like where's the heading because I was scared that he would do it. You know I could see that the long term future class and at that point ... it's not that someone says that like you really need to re-evaluate what you're doing and that if you work on something longterm like it's probably time to end it.
(00:30:20)
CLIENT: But I never wanted to ask that question because I was scared that that's maybe what his answer would be. It was something for like months, like the topic was like never brought up.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: But once he brought it up like I'm fine to talk about it. But I can't ... I guess like I have a hard time with initiating things too. It's like a vulnerability there. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_29445');">[note]</a><div id="_note_29445" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" directly addresses the comment I make about vulnerablility. She fears that if she speaks with her boyfriend about her interest in a future with hi, she'll learn he's not interested in a long-term relationship. She's worried about expressing her need for him because it makes her feel too vulnerable.</b></div>
(Pause)
CLIENT: But I don't want that because I feel I'm always like thinking about it but I just like can't say it or bring myself to say certain things or bring up a topic. So ... (Pause) I don't like being vulnerable. (Pause) There's something's you never know. And look I know that but I just can't ... I don't bring myself to be vulnerable. Or if I do it's like such small incremental steps of ... I guess it's some progress but it feels like real progress at the time.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Why aren't incremental steps not progress? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_30344');">[note]</a><div id="_note_30344" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I make this comment with her high expectations in mind along with her tendency toward all or nothing thinking. She's saying that if she doesn't reach a goal quickly, the progress she did make doesn't count and therefore she gives herself no credit for what she has accomplished.</b></div>
CLIENT: They are but I feel like it should be like at a faster pace or I guess I feel like ... I don't know like ... anxious or patience that's not I guess where it should be. Which is like an environment where I would feel like could say, "I feel this." And then knowing like whatever answer I have that like I can just proceed and like make a decision accordingly. (Sniffling) Excuse me. So, yeah, I think I'm like a patient too in that sometimes it's hard for me see like the bigger picture or like the desire don't come maybe like months down the road. I said this before but I like want a road map, you know I want to know like I could be here by... you know not day, but like this. I want to know when I'm going to feel better about something and that's obviously not how it works. But I feel like, I don't know, like the unknown is a little unsettling, really unsettling. . And like it's a brilliant (inaudible_00:33:20) like I hate not knowing. And I think that's one thing like life's sometimes like you never know. I think a lot of like and on that kind of conversation like that the first year probably of our relationship I was kind of like, like, "Do you really like me and want to date me seriously or not? Because if you don't maybe I shouldn't be in this." I feel like at that point you're still kind of like getting to know each other. But in my head it's like I needed that answer to like open up and move forward. And I wasn't okay with me not telling. But I feel like looking back like I don't know (inaudible_00:34:08) change like we still (inaudible_00:34:10) the same things together and treat each other the same way and ... but it's like if I ... I don't know.
(00:34:20)
CLIENT: I feel like I was like needing an answer to like open up a certain part of me. (Pause) I think that could be like debilitating. Even like looking at my relationship, I thought we had like, I mean there are other factors (inaudible_00:34:41) and stuff but I feel like, you know a good portion of that was like me just not opening up and ... it's just kind of funny looking back because it's like that like if what I wanted was to be like closer to someone and not opening up. It just took like more than double the time to get there. (Pause) It all chalks up to like I don't like being vulnerable. I don't know how to like change that but like practice it, it would still be like comfortable. Seems like I always that plain look I have so much at stake. But like maybe he don't like, you know like to reason with myself or to be able to accept some sort of perspective so I could put my whatever is at stake like in perspective, I don't know. (Pause) <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_33337');">[note]</a><div id="_note_33337" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" continues to think about this issue of vulnerability. She is working to make sense of her feelings about it and what she can do to overcome her fear. In psychoanalytic work, there's the idea of "getting out of a patient's way". This means, when the patient is productively engaged in the work, you give them the space to continue that work and not privilege your thoughts as the therapist. Knowing when to do this is an important part of analytic work.</b></div>
(00:35:48)
THERAPIST: What is at stake?
CLIENT: It's my feeling usually. Because if I, I don't know we talked before like I don't like to be sad so if like, you know the outcome of like a conversation about where my relationship is heading is not a positive one then I'm going to be really sad and upset and not really know how to deal with it. Or like in work I think it's more just like, like embarrassment or feel embarrassed. I don't know why I feel embarrassed so much because like thinking back like in work settings or even like my first serious boyfriend like in high school and college like when he cheated on me, I feel like I didn't tell my parents or even like most friends with the exception of a couple feel like months because I was sort of like deeply embarrassed that it happened. But like I felt like it was almost like personal like reflection on me, which I don't know why I felt that because obviously it was not in my control. But ... yeah. And like ... it's just like I feel like this is like, I don't know like eventually I'd like to make more sense as to why I feel like, really like deeply rooted like for when I was even like a young kid. Like this is so unbearable like in first grade I got like my teeth fell out. So like I didn't want to tell my mom because I felt like weird and embarrassed about it. Maybe like one of the youngest examples I could think of. It's always like the same like I don't know, weird kind of ... like I didn't know I was going to get in trouble.
(00:37:55)
CLIENT: It's just like some sort of like attention or something that like ... and like I don't recall exactly how felt with that and like I don't remember being like scared. I just remember feeling like really weird and awkward to feel like, "Mom my teeth fell out." (Sniffling) And I feel like that's like all through my life. I felt like just weird and embarrassed about things that aren't really in my control. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_35801');">[note]</a><div id="_note_35801" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Why she associates shame with her teeth falling out is a good question. In reading this transcript, it's not entirely clear but it's something I will keep in mind because for her there is clearly a connection. Psychoanalytic clinicians take the patients' associations as meaningful rather than coincidental because in "A"'s mind. there is a connection between losing teeth and shame. I could have simply commented on her shame or asked more about it. This would have been helpful, because what happens next is she moves away from this feeling.</b></div>
(Pause)
CLIENT: But, yeah, I don't know. I feel like ... I don't know if it's going to change but ... I don't know why I try to make sense of why.
(0038:45)
CLIENT: So ... and if I spend a little thinking about that ... (sniffling) (Pause)
THERAPIST: What kind of why do you think you're looking for?
CLIENT: Just help make sense of things, like sometimes when I figure out, I don't know why things ... put things in perspective or I don't know if I've been spending time thinking for a why that doesn't really matter because it's not going to change anything.
(Pause)
CLIENT: I guess I look for the why because like when I think of things now I'm kind of like, "All right well how can I ... or in my head I feel like there could be something that's like easy to change. But then when I like ... when I try to think about why I'm like that ... I just have thought processes like trying to think like maybe like the first time that I like felt like that and identify why I felt like that maybe. But things that happened recent is like much easier to do. But so then when I think about that I'm like literally just like going down the timeline to like being a kid and I kind of like better off no. I don't know why the why matters but that's I think why. I think I might almost afraid I like identify how I felt in a situation and made me think about really why I felt that way and ...
(Pause)
(00:40:37)
(Pause)
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_37905');">[note]</a><div id="_note_37905" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Psychoanalytic therapy privileges silence as much as it privileges talking. Sometimes patients actively work by themselves before introducing it to the therapist. If the therapist were o say something, she would interrupt rather than facilitate the patients' thoughts and associations. Second, silence is a form of communication and has meaning. Does silence mean that the patient is feeling lonely? Is she feeling disconnected? Is she feeling a kind of connection that does not require words? Psychoanalytic theory views the patient's experience of silence is important information about the patient's internal world.</b></div>
CLIENT: But yeah I'm sure of what to do like ... I guess I like ... I know if I just needed like reason with myself to gain perspective or but I'm not sure how I couldn't put myself out there to not be ... I don't know to not feel like so normal but like that I can't deal with it to put ... I feel a little nervous making the situation worse by not being vulnerable. (Sniffling)
THERAPIST: I look probably perplexed at the moment so try to think of ... I think like I'm thinking about is your sort of action plan to be vulnerable.
CLIENT: Oh.
THERAPIST: Is a way of not being vulnerable. (Pause) I mean if you have a plan in place there's not really any vulnerability. You just have to execute the plan.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I mean I understand you're trying to ... working really hard. But there's something that you're trying to do ... even the act of doing it prevents you from doing it.
CLIENT: Right.
(00:42:00)
CLIENT: Then I'm like, "I don't know what to do." I don't know if that's just once I have a situation like I really need to spend some time like this is where it goes downhill. Like I always have a situation and I spend time like weighting the pros and the cons and it's like I suffer from like analysis paralysis because I'm like thinking like ... it's like I'm thinking of all these outcomes, like if it goes like this how am I ... if it goes like this how am I going to feel? How am I going to act after? But I'm like psyching myself out, but I probably should just like ask whatever I need to ask and then find a way to deal with it. But I guess I don't like the vulnerability and like the dealing with it after. But I don't think my analyzing everything to the nth degree is going, you know change what you're going to say to me before I ask it because that's just whatever I'm speculating on.
(00:43_08)
(Pause)
CLIENT: But if I put them in a situation like I don't have that rational to pull myself up.
THERAPIST: I don't know why I'm thinking about ... I thought about it earlier in the session and it just came to my mind at the moment and I hope it's not (inaudible_00:43:29) but I was thinking about how frustrated you're dad seems for not being able to control people and trying to kind of like sort of muster all the resources he can to try through he has some money. But like there's such an intense frustration that he can't get people to do what he wants them to do. And it seems like at times you really identify with that part of him.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: And toward him. You know that you get frustrated at ... that you can't get him to do what you want him to do. Which is a whole lot of things that understandably want to do.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah. I mean I think that's a little bit because I do ... like I feel like ... well when my dad can't have his way I feel like he'll kick and scream and try manipulate and whatever. But I feel like I do have like that same tendency but like I want to control and if I don't have my way like I really don't like it. But I will be very quiet about it and like I'll just be very upset and like not really know like how to get it. But I feel like ... and when I do feel like that I really quickly like identify that he has that trait and then I feel immediately like ... like I don't want to feel this way and I don't want that association with him and ... but I think, yeah there is a certain type of like control aspect to it.
THERAPIST: I think maybe it came to mind at this moment from what we were talking about is because there's such a deep helplessness with that. Like this really intense desire to want to get people to do what you want them to do is like this very, very intensely helpless feeling. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_42411');">[note]</a><div id="_note_42411" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I'm not sure linking her experience to her father's behavior was a useful intervention. I think I could have made my point without doing so. The main point I wanted to get across was how her wish to predict and control outcomes comes from a sense of fear and helplessness. This would have been a more effective intervention.</b></div>
CLIENT: Yeah.
(00:45:34)
THERAPIST: You know it's like, "What drives that need to like you finally get someone to do what you want them to do?"
(Pause)
CLIENT: I don't know. (Sniffling) Yeah. I don't know. I think on terms of like my dad, like obviously like I want to have a relationship that I think is ideal with him. But (pause) ... I don't know.
THERAPIST: We need to stop right here.
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: So I will see you next Tuesday.
CLIENT: Sure. Excuse me. I'm getting a worse cold.
THERAPIST: And to remind you if I haven't. I think I mentioned this already. The second full week in February I'm not here.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Which is the thirteenth. The week of the thirteenth.
CLIENT: Okay. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Take care.
