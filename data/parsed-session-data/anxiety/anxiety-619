<b>I DON'T GET IT,</b> she wote. <i>Can postpartum depression really make a
</i><i>woman kill?</i>


We were discussing—as was just about everyone at the time—
Andrea Pia Yates, the suburban Houston housewife who killed
her five children in the summer of 2001 by drowning them in the
bathtub.


<i>How could a mother do that?</i> the woman wanted to know.


We were talking on an Internet message board for mothers in
Austin, but we weren't really communicating. A couple of people
had already tried to explain. Postpartum depression is not postpartum
<i>psychosis</i>. There's been some psychiatric mismanagement, some
misuse of Haldol, someone alleged.


<i>Okay</i>, the woman said. <i>But I still don't understand</i>.


Then came the inevitable follow-up: <i>Is postpartum depression
real?</i>


I sighed.


I'd stumbled into the forum looking for answers of my own.
When you are home with a baby and you are depressed, your options
for outreach are limited. You are not flitting around the coffee shop
with a happy baby in a travel system. You are probably not wearing

Here was a forum online, one with a section devoted to discussion
of PPD, ostensibly among mothers who are dealing with it,
who are fighting it. I was looking for another depressed mother
anywhere I could find her. Yet the only post was from a doubter, a
"good" mother who said, <i>But I never felt that way. How could she?</i>


Wherever you go, you will find people who don't believe in
postpartum depression. For whatever reason. It's an urban legend.
It's like the Twinkie Defense; it was invented by "feminists" to apologize
for filicide. Meanwhile, you're sitting there with it.


Until those of us who battle it and win—or at least cope—speak
up, parental depression will enter public discourse only when the
unthinkable happens. When a person loses her mind entirely. When
reality slips away from her and she believes that, as surely as these
words are printed on a page, something evil has possessed her family
and must be banished with extreme measures. When she has become
psychotic. When she has tried to kill herself twice in the span of a
month and failed. When she has been hospitalized repeatedly. When
she has accrued literally thousands of pages in her medical record.
When she has refused to take the medication prescribed for her after
her first suicide attempt and has begun mutilating her own body.
When she has stopped feeding her children. When she has become
convinced that hidden cameras in the ceiling of her home—at this
point a 350-square-foot bus converted into a trailer house by her
husband—are spying on her and the television is speaking to her.
When she has finally entered a catatonic state for ten days.

This was Andrea Yates on July 20, 1999, long before any of
us began to talk about her problems. Shortly thereafter, her husband,
Rusty, moved the family to Clear Lake, a suburb far away
from Andrea's psychiatrist. Her new physician, Dr. Mohammed
Saeed, discontinued her medication, the antipsychotic Haldol, and
urged her to "think positive thoughts"—a challenge for someone so
debilitated that she had recently stopped talking altogether.


Two days after Saeed released her from an inpatient hospital
stay with this advice, she systematically killed all her children and
laid their bodies in the family bed. One child still clutched strands
of Andrea's hair, yanked out in a struggle.


Andrea told a prison psychiatrist, "My children weren't righteous.
They stumbled because I was evil. The way I was raising
them, they could never be saved. They were doomed to perish in
the fires of hell."


Her words echoed the teachings of Michael Woroniecki, an
unordained minister who preached that "bad mothers who are going
to hell create bad children who will go to hell." Woroniecki began
his career evangelizing on the streets of Grand Rapids, Michigan,
but was essentially forced from town after he harangued a woman
who was trying to buy tickets for a circus. He was charged with
disorderly conduct. He moved on to spread his message elsewhere,
such as the campus of Brigham Young University, where Woroniecki
called students "Mormon scumbags" and handed out self-authored
pamphlets entitled "The Witch and the Wimp" with his
wife and six children.


"As man was created to dominate, God reveals that woman was

[p. <i>222</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00235&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was at one of these demonstrations—at Auburn University
in the mid-1980s—that Michael Woroniecki met Rusty Yates. Sub-sequently,
Andrea became passionately devoted to Woroniecki's
teachings.


Like most of Woroniecki's followers, Andrea corresponded with
the traveling minister by mail. A dedicated search on the Internet
unearths videos of Woroniecki's teachings—long-distance instructions
for his flock, some posted by disgruntled students who've since
rejected their leader. Before a plain backdrop, he speaks at length of
the need to raise children righteously, lest they face the fires of hell.
And I do mean that literally. Woroniecki describes the only godly
mother: "a submitted woman who's got the fear of God in her heart
for what her mother Eve has done." In a chilling moment he urges,
"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble,
it is better for him that a heavy millstone be hung around [the
child's] neck and he be drowned in the depths of the sea."


Perhaps we can begin to answer the question: <i>How could a mother
do that?</i>


Yet it isn't only mothers who kill seemingly without warning. Consider
Delfin Bartolome, by all reports a mild-mannered, fifty-five-year-old
father of three. After picking up his twenty-seven-year-old
autistic son from a nearby school for adults with developmental disabilities,

[p. <i>223</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00236&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I can understand where that man had gotten to," Mary Kate
Saunders, another parent of an autistic child, told <i>The Orange County
Register</i>. "You just pray you never get there."


Parents of autistic children are famously desperate, due to the
extreme <i>lifelong</i> pressures in raising their children. Danielle Blais
of Montreal drowned her six-year-old son, Charles-Antoine, in
the bathtub in 1996. Carmen Lahaie, the president of the Autism
Society of Greater Montreal, told <i>The Toronto Globe and Mail</i>, "Ms.
Blais's act was unacceptable but understandable."


Janine Albury-Thomson of New Zealand strangled her daughter,
Casey, in 1998.


Daniela Dawes of Sydney, Australia, was being treated for
depression when she suffocated her ten-year-old son, Jason, and
then attempted unsuccessfully to kill herself.


How could these parents do that?


In an article about the Bartolome murder-suicide, Jon Shestack,
another parent to a child with autism, told <i>The Orange County Register</i>,
"I don't look at (the murder-suicide) and think that guy was
an alien or a monster. I just think how terribly sad and hopeless
he might have felt. I can imagine it, because I can understand the
burden on families."


When parents feel hopeless—when there is no respite care
available, when their children's needs exceed their own compassion,
when they have become depressed or psychotic, when there is no
other way out but death—they are capable of murder.

[p. <i>224</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00237&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

None of this is to suggest that murder is excusable. It is not,
and to suggest otherwise devalues the lives of the victims. Yet it is
also not <i>inexplicable</i>. There are reasons for these tragedies, and it is
incumbent upon all parents to understand them. To the poster on
that message board: Yes, it is real. It is possible to love your children
and kill them with your own hands. It is sad and horrific and wrong,
but it is possible.


In writing this chapter, I was literally unable to keep up with
reports of filicide. On November 22, 2004, a month before my
deadline, Dena Schlosser of Dallas cut the arms off her daughter,
Margaret, almost a year old. Margaret Schlosser bled nearly to death
in her crib and expired at the hospital shortly after her mother was
apprehended. Dena Schlosser still held a knife in her hand when
police arrived.


I was revising this chapter on December 3, when Andrea Labbe
of Toronto stabbed her husband, two of their three young daughters,
and finally herself. At the time of this writing, police have refused
to comment upon speculations that Labbe was suffering from postpartum
psychosis or a report (broken in <i>The Toronto Sun</i>) that Labbe
left a suicide note.


These cases inspire a frenzy of finger-pointing: Who was asleep
at the switch when these women decided to kill their children? The
Ontario Women's Health Network cited the Labbe case in its argument
against proposed cuts in funding for hospital-based postpartum
support services. The Schlosser family, on the other hand, had
been investigated by Child Protective Services months before Margaret
's murder, when Dena ran out of the house screaming, leaving

Others point to cultural factors surrounding the killings. Like
Andrea Yates, Dena Schlosser was profoundly influenced by a fundamentalist
minister who preaches that women are innately wicked,
redeemed only through submission to their husbands. Doyle Davidson,
of Water of Life Ministries, had, in fact, been arrested after
trying to "cast the devil" out of a rebellious female parishioner.
Dena's stepfather, a licensed therapist, told the Associated Press,
"This diminishing of women, this diminishing of women's powers,
women's importance, referring to women as jezebels, I think, further
undermines an already fragile ego state that Dena's experiencing."


"I'm an apostle and I'm a prophet," Davidson countered. "I only
teach what's in the Bible and that's what makes them mad."


Michael Woroniecki likewise denies that his teachings played a
role in Andrea Yates's psychosis. "I'm responsible for what I preach,"
he told the newspaper <i>Central Michigan Life</i>. "I can't be responsible
for what they do with it."


Woroniecki blames Rusty for the deaths. " [Andrea] was a very
caring, loving, intelligent woman. When [she] was put in that kind
of pressure cooker, it was too much for her. [Rusty] let Andrea get
into that situation, where she needed help. Then, he couldn't help
her and wouldn't recognize that she needed him and Jesus. He let
Andrea suffer under that."

[p. <i>226</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00239&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>TIME</i> reporter Michelle McCalope quoted Rusty Yates in eulogizing
his five children: "Andrea asked me about kids. She said ‘do
you want boys or girls?’ I said I wanted to get a basketball team first,
then we can talk about girls."


Yet Yates's brother and mother told <i>Good Morning America</i> that
Rusty had never changed a diaper.


<i>Eventually I began to find certain answers of my own</i>.


I met a mother online whose PPD had verged on psychosis. She
wrote to me in a private message: <i>I don't tell many people this, but I am
telling you because I know how you feel. I got to a point that I was afraid
to be left alone with [my son]. I understood how those women killed their
children</i>. She was beginning to lose touch with reality. Driving back
from the library, she sat at a stop sign a mile from her house, completely
unsure in which direction to turn.


Another wrote to me: <i>This is the ultimate uncensored truth that I
rarely admit to anyone. For the first two to three years of his life I truly
disliked my son. He had colic and reflux and asthma and I was convinced
he was autistic (he is not). He hated to be held and would fight me</i>—<i>he
threw things and hit me all the time. He didn't nap, he didn't sleep at
night. I tried co-sleeping, I tried letting him scream, I tried all the methods,
I took him to strange doctors. He turned two in June of 1999, and that
summer was the worst summer of my life. I felt like my soul was dead, and
frankly, I was pissed [because it was my son's] fault</i>.


That fall, she returned to full-time paid work outside the home.
("It was the only way I could ever survive.") To everyone's surprise,
the child flourished in Montessori preschool. Now, she says, "He's

[p. <i>227</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00240&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Why do some of us survive while others slip away—into profoundly
delusional thinking, into sudden, appalling violence against
the very people we love? That's really the question the other mother
was asking us online. What separates you—monstrous and perverse,
a Medea—from me? Where is the line between a mother with "normal
" problems germane to her station—the fatigue, the loneliness,
the isolation, the worry, the constant interruption of her thoughts
and actions—and a mother who snaps?


Until you've actually felt your brain slip out from under you,
your answers to this question will be purely theoretical. Until
you've actually had unwished-for thoughts in your head, thoughts
you couldn't shake away, thoughts that didn't fade, thoughts that
lingered so long they turned you upside down and became real.
Until they replaced you and you were no longer there. Maybe you
even felt yourself dissolving, like sugar. It's the strangest sensation
I've ever had, to feel my personality separate into its component
parts and very nearly disintegrate while my body remained entire. I
could walk around my apartment touching things, but someone else
perceived the sensations.


Once you have been there, you know where the line is.


When I was pregnant, I became convinced that I was going to
abuse my child sexually. The idea just popped, fully formed, into
my mind one day, apropos of evidently nothing. At twenty-nine
years old, I did not have an abuse history, either as a victim or a

[p. <i>228</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00241&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The thoughts bombarded me. Eventually I would spend all day
struggling to squeeze them out. I could focus on nothing else. I'd sit
glazed-eyed through meetings I was supposed to lead. I'd mumble my
way through conversations with the people I knew. I'd sit for hours
without speaking while battling myself inside. I'd drive seven or eight
blocks out of the way to avoid a middle school on my way home from
work. Kids ran track and practiced football outside at that time of day,
and I was terrified of what I might think or feel, even though I had no
reason to suspect myself of anything untoward. Several times a day,
my composure would break and I would cry quietly, dreading what
I would inevitably do to my child. I knew that, statistically speaking,
women were less likely to commit sexual abuse of minors (the figure
is about 14 percent). But what if I were an anomaly, a truly irregular
person, like Karla Homolka, the submissive wife who helped her
sociopathic husband sedate, rape, and kill her sister? I knew it was a
long shot. But could I prove that I was normal? I couldn't.


I told no one of these thoughts, especially not my husband or
my doctor. Indeed, writing these words is my first confession. I
have written and erased it several times. I realize saying these words

[p. <i>229</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00242&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I can't explain why, but the feelings finally passed. I'd spent two
weeks, easily, frantically trying to reassure myself that I was <i>not one of
those people</i>. And in those two weeks I'd seen how easily a compulsive
and irrational notion could take hold. How easily I could come to
be a stranger to myself. How hard it was to fight the pull of insanity.
Even now, I feel at times that an obsessive or depressive episode
could happen in the next moment. But I feel it calmly, if you can
imagine that. I can't prove to myself that my next thought won't be
terrifying and unwanted, just as I can't prove to myself that my house
will not be obliterated by a meteor, or that I won't have a heart attack
as soon as I stand up. Since I can neither prove nor disprove any of
these things, surely I can't remain captive to the possibility.


I do know that I could never harm my child. If I ever felt the
temptation, I'd resist it at any cost. I'd kill myself if I had to. Yet I
recognize that I sit here with advantages many other women do not
have. I have not been brainwashed. I sought help and received it
because within my personal history is the belief—the knowledge—
that mental illness need not be kept secret, despite our collective
fear of it. I have not been turned out of hospitals unwell, dominated
by a loutish husband. I do not have three children under the age of
three. But the significant difference between their lives and mine is
that I never really went under. I just got close enough to the water
to see my reflection.
