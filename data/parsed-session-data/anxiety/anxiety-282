In preceding chapters we have examined the timing,
form, and content of psychotic experience as revealed
through accounts obtained from individual patients. In
the present chapter, utilizing these and other records, we
will construct a composite picture of the experiential sequences
in acute psychotic reactions. As a general model,
this formulation will not be completely comprehensive;
nevertheless, it will serve to highlight the temporal progression
of processes we have been emphasizing in the
individual accounts.


The study of consciousness is frustrating. Though we
utilize each day a basic faith that our experience is closely
akin to that of our fellows, it is categorical that we can
never demonstrate scientifically that we are in fact observing
another's conscious experience. We can ask
("What are you thinking?" or "What were you feeling?"),
but we can never be sure of the validity of the
report. Yet we proceed operationally in all phases of human
encounter, and we act on the notion that we can, for
purposes of living, come close to understanding the experience
of another. There are ways of refining this approach.
One can go over and over an experience with

Fifteen patients, ages 20 to 38, were studied in die hospital
over periods of from six weeks to three months following
their first admission for an acute psychotic reaction,
meaning here simply an acute delusional process
with no known organic or toxic cause and usually
treated with antipsychotic drugs. In these individuals,
rather rapid remission of psychotic symptoms often allowed
detailed investigation with the patient regarding
his experience of the illness. Individual patients were
seen in interviews (usually three or four), and were asked
to give their own account of the onset and progression of
their experience. Patients were asked qualifying questions
such as "What did you think was happening?,"
"How did you explain that to yourself?," etc. From these
interviews a composite picture of the progression of the
experience of acute psychosis was obtained.


The timing of the acute psychotic reaction is of particular
interest, and we have considered this issue in
some detail previously. We have pointed to the way in
which the confluence of individual liability or trait, developmental
task and current circumstance (including
drug use) interact to influence timing in acute psychosis.
Patients often initially said that "It came out of the
blue;" however, on further questioning one could essentially
always discover a state of mind characterized by
conflict and impasse. Such phrases as "I had nowhere to

<b>Example 1—A</b> 23-year-old nurse graduate student was
preparing a thesis proposal around the time of her acute
psychotic disruption. She had been raised in a very sheltered
family in the Midwest. Immediately prior to her
admission she had become rather intimately involved
with two different men; this experience had forced serious
rethinking of her sexual attitudes. In addition, she
had simultaneously been involved in a "T-group" experience
which stressed "being yourself." Questions
about her role and feelings as a woman were frequently
raised in therapy subsequently. A rough draft of the thesis
proposal (a manual for breast feeding) contained the
following statements:
<blockquote>
<p>
This researcher feels that the mother needs support
in her decision to breast feed and a basic understanding
of how to do it. If a mother is motivated to
breast feed, it is her right as an individual to do it,
and it is the responsibility of those who know how
to help her, to give her the help ... perhaps the
reason they can't really help her is because they
make her feel she shouldn't have the right to do
what she wants because they feel they can't ... the
confidence is based on the fact that the mother is a

woman who has the facilities to breast feed and then
assumes she can. However, the mother will quickly
lose this confidence when she finds that there can be
obstacles to breast feeding if she doesn't know what
to do with them. When a mother decides how to
feed her baby, she needs confidence that she can do
it, and her ability to do it demonstrates that she
knows how and so has reason for her confidence.

<b>Example 2—A</b> 21-year-old male undergraduate was
involved in an intimate relationship with a woman, his
first, just prior to his admission for acute psychosis. He
had also been exploring a number of other new activities,
such as drinking, of which he felt his parents
would disapprove. At the same time he was writing what
was to him a very important paper on "musical nationalism."
Six weeks after admission he spoke of this paper
as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>
I spent the summer thinking about my nationalism
paper. If my concept of nationalism is correct, it has
implications for 19th century romanticism, much
of which needs revising. According to some sources
this is all that happened in the 19th century. But
somehow the old concept didn't take care of all the
facts. The old boundaries couldn't handle all the
material. In addition to nationalism and romanticism,
there was also liberalism and individualism.
I was trying to feel my way through a whole body of
material which had been largely unexplored.

Both of these examples of "displacement" of the pre-psychotic
conflict graphically depict the contending in-trapsychic
forces. In the first an outgrown, apologetic
feminine self-concept confronts a more positive, self-assured

THE DESTRUCTURING OF PERCEPTION AND AFFECT


<i>The Experience of Heightened Awareness</i>


From the experience of impasse, patients often but not
invariably proceeded to an experience of heightened
awareness. It was sometimes difficult to catch this transition
before the onset of true delusions, yet it was clear-cut
in some instances. This kind of experience was discussed
in a previous chapter and noted in several patients'
records. It is actually similar to one which many
people have at times of acute crisis or "peak" life experience.
There is a feeling of inexpressible urgency.
The need for sleep seems to lessen and insomnia often
sets in unnoticed. There is a sense that something is
about to happen. Visual and auditory sensation may
seem particularly acute. Thoughts and perceptions come
faster than they can be assimilated. At such times individuals
may feel that their minds have awakened, that
they are functioning at a high level, or that their creative
powers are enhanced. They may experience emotions
with singular intensity and often are overcome with a
sense of benevolence or overwhelming fear. Memories of
childhood and long-forgotten emotions or emotionally
colored events may surge into consciousness. Some patients
reported temporarily enhanced sexual feeling. It is

In addition to the sense of heightened awareness to
inner and outer stimuli, there is frequently a temporarily
heightened sense of self. Erikson
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_9897');">[note]</a><div id="_note_9897" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">2. Erikson, E. <i>Identity and the life cycle</i>. New York:
International Universities Press, 1959.</div>
has noted that identity
is an experience as well as a psychological construct. He
further states that there are periods of extreme identity
consciousness, that "We are thus most aware of our identity
when we are just about to gain it ... or when we are
just about to enter a crisis and feel the encroachment of
identity diffusion." The following description of heightened
awareness, written in retrospect by a young student
admitted for acute psychosis, demonstrates most of the
characteristics of this altered state of consciousness.
<blockquote>
<p>
One night I woke up and started feeling good
again. I felt I could do more with my time, that anything
was possible. I felt alive and vital, full of energy.
My senses seemed alive, colors were very bright,
they hit me harder. Things appeared clear-cut; I noticed
things I had never noticed before. There was a
feeling of exhilaration, a sense of union with the
whole world. Time slowed down, much more experience
could be crowded into a brief time span.
Sexually I felt awakened, competent, responsive. I
seemed to notice symmetry and harmony, and I
wanted to experience everything. I could concentrate
on a speck of something and just stare at it. A
whole new world opened up, and I felt more secure
than ever before. I felt like an individual, that I had
found my identity which had always been like
patchwork before. I saw individuality in others
now, and I enjoyed having differences.

<i>Ideas of Reference and Influence</i>


Not only is the pace of experience for the incipient
psychotic frequently heightened, it is also qualitatively
altered. Things seem to have hidden meanings, neutral
individuals are suddenly animated with strange ideas
and designs, curious connections between feelings and
perception are experienced. Categories of relevance, normally
capable of sifting experience automatically, are
broadened. Everything experienced is measured as to its
possible relevance for the individual. Most non-psychotic
individuals can recall times of acute crisis in
which every sound, every newcomer was processed in-trapsychically
with regard to his relevance for the crisis
at hand. This phenomenon can be seen teleologically as
serving a useful function, for at times of mortal danger
(real or assumed), the organism is geared to scrutinize
the entire perceptual field. For the incipient psychotic
the suspicion or possibility of relevance soon proceeds to
the "idea of reference," perhaps the cardinal characteristic
of psychotic experience. We wish to emphasize that
this shift is not intellectual but experiential. The individual
literally has the irrefutable cognitive experience
that this or that object, person, event, or transaction has
meaning for him. Talking with individuals about this
stage soon convinces one that this process is an over-whelmingly
convincing one. It cannot be argued away.
Categories of relevance have simply broadened in these
individuals' experiences prior to the formation and systematization
of meaning (delusions). The individual experiences
the subsequent "press for meaning" as extraordinarily
intense. Normal strictures of what is logical,
reasonable, and probable fall before the onslaught of this
state of increased input and disarticulated categories of
relevance. Usually the experiencing self identifies the

Before my marriage, I was bothered by premature
ejaculation. I tried to control this by developing my
lower abdominal muscles. I became aware that my
sexual ability was related to a burning sensation in
my lower back. When this sensation was in front, in
my loins, I felt like a totally different person, a real
man. I worked for a man named Butch who was a
very strong person. When Butch made certain
movements with his feet I could feel the burning
sensation move into my loins. I really thought that
should happen with my father, but it never did.
When these things are in the right place I feel whole
and vibrant inside, there is something there to push
me. It is a pleasure to look at someone else's eyes,
feel healthy yourself, and see a healthy gaze in their
eyes. I know this burning feeling inside me did happen
and was affected by other people.


Thus, in acute psychosis the idea of reference or influence
is an experience in which categories of experiential
relevance are expanded due to several interacting processes.
First, overwhelming anxiety seems to lead to hypervigilance
and increased sensory scanning. Secondly,
ideation and perception, normally somewhat interdependent
at an adaptive level, tend to cross-contaminate
each other and lead to idea-induced reality distortion or

[p. <i>184</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

THE DESTRUCTURING OF THE SENSE OF SELF


<i>The Experience of Identity Dissolution</i>


Almost invariably the previously described feeling of a
heightened sense of self gives way to the experience of a
progressive loss of the sense of self. Identity diffusion, as
described by Erikson, refers to a rather gradual psychosocial
process. However, in acute psychosis the loss of
the immediate ongoing sense of self (mental self-representation)
can often assume dramatic and bizarre proportions,
as illustrated in several preceding chapters. Another
illustrative example is that of a 26-year-old medical
student who, at the time of my interview, had been in the
hospital for three weeks because of an acute psychotic
reaction. Describing the first day of hospitalization, he
said:
<blockquote>
<p>
I had the idea that I didn't know who I was and
I had to find out. I kept looking at the patients
in my room to find out which one I looked
like. I saw the bad side of each of them and
became convinced this was the side I was similar
to. I tried on other people's clothes. I said
to myself, "If his clothes fit you then you must
be like him." The next morning I felt okay, I
knew I was ——————————— [Name],
that I was a doctor in training, so I put on a
white coat.

Having described other instances of altered self-experiences
in the first chapter, we simply wish to reemphasize
that in the acute psychotic experience the normally
functioning and automatized mental self-representation
often gives way.


<i>The Formation of Delusions</i>


Delusion formation has been classically considered to
be a restitutive process. So it seems to be (teleologically
speaking), but this view gives us no clues as to the experiential
sequences involved. The foregoing consideration
of the predelusional experience in incipient psychosis
and the patient accounts suggest that delusions
are understandable constructs derived from experiences
of heightened and altered sensory influx and self-experience,
widened categories of relevance, and a push for
closure or meaning centering around certain intrapsychic
themes. It is apparent that for the acutely psychotic
individual, prior learning about "reality" has little voice
once the process of delusion formation has set in.


A young man, a Ph.D. in psychology and a third-year
medical student, developed an acute psychotic reaction
and was able to give the following account of stages in
the process of delusion formation. His experience is cited
because of the insight it provides into the details of the
formation and maintenance of delusional ideas in acute
psychosis. This student had been experiencing extreme
emotional lability as well as the haunting notion that
there was something very wrong with him, that he might
be going to die, that he could not breathe. One morning,
after spending a fear-ridden night during which he slept
little, he recounted later (author's italics):

[p. <i>186</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I got up at 7 a.m., dressed, and drove to the hospital.
I felt my breathing trouble might be due to an
old heart lesion. I had been told when I was young
that I had a small ventricular septal defect. I decided
that I was in heart failure and that people felt I
wasn't strong enough to accept this, so they weren't
telling me. <i>I thought about all the things that had
happened recently that could be interpreted in that
light</i>. I looked up heart failure in a textbook and
found that the section had been removed, so I concluded
someone had removed it to protect me. <i>I remembered
other comments</i>. A friend had talked
about a "walkie talkie," and the thought occurred
to me that I might be getting medicine without my
knowledge perhaps by radio. I remembered someone
talking about a one-way plane ticket; to me that
meant a trip to Houston and a heart operation. I
remembered an unusual smell in the lab and
thought that might be due to the medicine they
were giving me in secret. I began to think I might
have a machine inside of me which secreted medicine
into my blood stream. Again I reasoned that I
had a disease no one could tell me about and was
getting medicine for it secretly. At this point, I panicked
and tried to run away, but the attendant in the
parking lot seemed to be making a sign to motion
me back. I thought I caught brief glimpses of a
friend and my wife so I decided to go back into the
hospital. A custodian's eyes attracted my attention;
they were especially large and piercing. He looked
very powerful. He seemed to be "in on it," maybe he
was giving medicine in some way. Then I began to
have the feeling that other people were watching
me. And, as periodically happened throughout the
early stages, <i>I said to myself that the whole thing</i>

[p. <i>187</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00187&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

From experiences such as this one and others, a sequence
of events in the formation of delusions is suggested.
(1) Impasse, dread, and overwhelming anxiety;
(2) altered experience of self and world (as described
above); (3) press for "making sense" of the experience;
(4) overcoming of constraints imposed by normal reality
guards; and (5) a certain relief and comfort (even elation)
experienced with the delusional idea. Apparently, a
whole series of interactions between the individual self
and its altered perception of the world are required for
the formation of delusional experience; in addition, a variety
of ego functions or lack of them (as previously suggested
for the psychedelic experience) are involved in the
stepwise formation and maintenance of the delusional
system.


The theoretical heritage of this work stems from the
unique contributions of Paul Federn, and it seems appropriate
to outline his ideas here. Federn took seriously
the universal fact of ego <i>Erlebnis</i>, or ego experience, and
utilized phenomenological observations to significantly
modify existing psychoanalytic theories of psychosis.
Whereas Freud had theorized that psychoses were characterized
by an enhanced investment of the ego with mental
energy consequent upon withdrawal from reality,
Federn insisted that the ego in psychosis was defective
and weakened. Current psychotherapeutic activities with
psychotics rely heavily upon this notion. Federn felt that
ego boundary cathexis was weakened in psychosis, the
normal ability of the individual to take distance from or
usefully to employ the unconscious, to distinguish ideation
from reality, and to respond selectively to external
sensation was impaired. He was undoubtedly influenced

More recently, students of the phenomenology of psychosis
have emphasized the personal side, the existential
pain, of the psychotic experience. R. D. Laing has been a
major protagonist for approaching psychosis from the
philosophical-existentialist viewpoint. He deplores the
dehumanizing aspects of conventional clinical terminology
and calls for a new "science of persons." His thesis
proceeds from a descriptive, intuitive, and philosophical
analysis of the "self system," and his goal is to understand
in emphathic terms the patient's style of being in
the world. In the United States, Adolf Meyer and Harry
Stack Sullivan were responsible for initial efforts to understand
psychotic patients from the viewpoint of individual
developmental psychology. Searles, basing his
observations upon extraordinarily prolonged psychotherapeutic
relationships with psychotic patients, discusses
their tendency to confuse feeling and outer reality
from the viewpoint of pathological interpersonal development,
focusing particularly upon family attitudes in
the growth and maintenance of reliable anchoring
points for the experience of self and external world.

Otto Will and Donald Burnham, also in the tradition of
Meyer and Sullivan, develop a similar position.

approaches the problem of the psychotic individual's
view of his world from a strictly philosophical viewpoint,
but ends up very close to Searles and Laing in his
conclusions.

Chapman and McGhie have studied the subjective
world of the psychotic from the viewpoint of cognitive
disorganization.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_30267');">[note]</a><div id="_note_30267" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">9. See ref. 12, <i>Introduction</i>.</div>
Their studies initially described
and catalogued the various kinds of altered cognitive experience
in psychosis, with minimal consideration of
personal, existential, and developmental aspects. They
focused upon sensory overstimulation, defects in attention,
and word-finding difficulties in their patients. More
recently, Freeman, with McGhie and Cameron, presented
extensive material toward the development of a
comprehensive theory of psychosis, a theory which
would account both for an altered state of consciousness
as well as individual-specific dynamic themes and content.
Focusing upon the concept of impaired object relations
in psychotic states, these authors integrated their
observations of disordered cognition in these conditions
into an overall psychoanalytic framework.
