spiritual yearning had been to reconnect with the source of my
passion and, in so doing, finally to dispel my fear of being

THE WEEK AFTER Korama and I moved back to Los Angeles,
my article ran in the Sunday edition of <i>The Washington
Post</i>. Bryan, Jade, and Scott called to congratulate me. My
father also called.


"I'm impressed," he said. "It was pretty good."


Had anyone else spoken those words, I would have been
bubbling over with joy, but with my father, I found reason
to be offended.


"What do you mean, you're impressed?" I asked, defensively.
"You didn't think I could write?"


"Nana-Ama," he said stiffly, "I didn't say that. You and I
both know that whenever you decide to do whatever it is you
want to do with your life, you'll do it well."


Then he shut himself back up in his shell of silence,

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I waited for my mother to call, but as the day wore on, I
grew tired of waiting, and decided to call her.


"Did you get the paper today?" I asked.


"Yes," she said.


"Did you read my article?"


"Yes," she said.


"So," I huffed impatiently, "did you like it?"


"It was really nice," she replied matter-of-factly. You
should mail a copy to Uncle Paul." I thought she was going
to say something else about the article, something more
heartening, more laudatory, but that was all. Dissatisfied, I
fished for a more distinct compliment.


"My editor really liked the piece. He says I might be able
to do another one pretty soon."


"That sounds great," she said. "Have you found a job
yet?"


On Monday, when the out-of-town papers hit the L.A.
newsstands, I picked up a copy of the <i>Post</i>. I thought that seeing
my first major byline would make me feel some profound
sense of achievement. It didn't. It merely added to my misery.
What was it that I wanted to accomplish with my life?


I was working part-time as a personal assistant for a writer
who also happened to be a friend. The job didn't pay a
whole lot, but it was better than being unemployed. Korama
was in preschool and Justin started picking her up for
regular visits two evenings a week. Seeing him so frequently
turned out to be a good thing. It was a constant reminder of
how easily my life could spin out of control if I didn't keep

[p. <i>[175]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By the end of March, I started to feel displaced; I wanted
desperately to get my own place. I didn't bother to go apartment
hunting because I knew it would be a wasted effort. My
credit was bad and, even with the money I had saved from
my job, I couldn't front a first, last, and security deposit. I
called a former landlord who agreed to rent me a one-bedroom
bungalow-style apartment on a deferred payment
plan. He was the same landlord who came to my rescue after
Justin threw me out. The apartment was teeny, less than
seven-hundred square feet, but it had a lot of character.
There were six other bungalows in the complex, five of
which were occupied by struggling artists.


Everyday after work, I went by the apartment and walked
through it, dreaming of all the wonderful things I would fill
it with. The night before I was supposed to move in, I
stopped by, as usual. The door was locked and my key, the
same one I had used all those other nights, couldn't open it.
Determined to get in, I kept trying the key, turning the
knob, leaning my weight on the door, pushing, banging,
until finally, three of the glass panes on the door shattered.


I walked across the small courtyard and knocked on a
neighbor's door. A young, freckle-faced white man opened
the door a crack and stuck his head out.


"Yes," he said, his reddish-blond hair falling into his
eyes. I introduced myself and asked if I could use his phone
to call the landlord. He looked at me suspiciously, said, "I
guess," handed me a cordless phone and then shut the door

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After I was completely unpacked and feeling a bit settled, I
began calling everyone I knew in town to let them know that
I was back. My Rolodex, I soon discovered, was totally outdated.
Most everyone I knew had moved or changed jobs. I
called my friends on the East Coast to give them my new
phone number and address. Jade was not home, but that was
to be expected. I left a message on the machine and figured
that she would get back to me when she was up to it. Everyone
else I talked to was in the midst of some major life
change: Bryan had joined the Peace Corps and was leaving
for Budapest; Eugene was now living with his girlfriend;
Scott was being evicted. And, on top of that, he had gotten
into a fist fight, during which his nose was broken.


I had foolishly envisioned everyone going about the same
routines, living the same lives they had been when I was
there. It really threw me. Time was moving way too fast and
though I was hell-bent on chasing it, I never could catch up.
I always fell behind.


On April 5, 1993, a few days after we moved into our new
apartment, Korama turned two. Her birthday amplified
the sense of urgency I was feeling. When I looked at her, I
didn't see a baby anymore. She was a little person who was

[p. <i>[177]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, money was tight. The rent and utilities got
paid, and there was food in the house, but that was it. Korama
had none of the luxuries other kids had. There were
no fancy clothes, shiny toys, or exciting activities. These
things may sound trivial, but when everybody in preschool
except your child has seen the latest movie and owns the hot
new toy, you can't help but to feel as if, on some level, you
are failing her.


Finding a full-time job was harder than I imagined. I
hadn't worked a regular full-time job since I was twenty
years old. My hours of availability were limited because Korama
had to be picked up from preschool by six every
evening. I registered with temp agencies but ended up having
to turn down all of the assignments that were offered to
me. The public transit system in Los Angeles is, at its best,
slow and unreliable. And the city is huge and sprawling.
Without a car, it was impossible for me to get from a job to
the preschool in time to pick Korama up.


I tried to reorient myself with the art world in hopes of
finding a more flexible source of income. In late April, I
created and mounted a theatrical piece. It was well-received
but nothing concrete came out of it. I sent my resume and
writing samples out to various magazines that I knew worked
with freelancers. There were no immediate responses. You
can only try so hard and do so much until, finally, you
admit defeat.

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My unhappiness underscored everything I did. On the days
that I wasn't working my part-time job, I dropped Korama
off at school, came home, and got back in bed. It was a relief
to not have to move a muscle. I didn't leave the house unless
it was absolutely necessary. I'd lie in bed and do nothing
until even that felt like it was taking an excessive amount of
effort. Then I would go outside and sit on my front stoop.
That's how I came to befriend my neighbor, Harold Stanton,
the one who had slammed his door in my face.


Harold usually came home on his lunch break and found
me sitting there, staring off into space. Once, he invited me
to join him for lunch and, after that, it became a regular
event. He and I would sit in front of his television set with
sandwiches in hand and watch <i>All My Children</i>. Sometimes
after work, he would bang on my door and we would hop
into his Miata and go grocery shopping together. To an extent,
he and I assumed the same relationship that I'd had
with both Scott and Bryan. He braced me with companionship.
But unlike Scott and Bryan, Harold maintained very
solid boundaries with me. He refused to be my rescuer. The
deeper I fell into depression, the harder I tried to cling to
him.


"Meri, you're really wearing me out," he once told me.
"Why don't you get some help, go into therapy?"


Since arriving in Los Angeles, I hadn't given therapy a
second thought. Having distanced myself—physically—from
my past, therapy just wasn't a priority.


"I've considered it," I told Harold. "But I can't afford to
right now."

[p. <i>[179]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Seems to me," he said, "the way you're feeling, you can't
afford not to."


In May, I borrowed some money from a friend and took a
six-day trip to D.C. Bryan was leaving for Hungary in a few
months and I wanted to spend some time with him. Mum
was excited about seeing Korama and me. Everyday before
we left, she called to check, double-check, and triple-check
our flight itinerary. On the day of our arrival, she left work
early to prepare my favorite meal. I, too, was looking forward
to seeing her. That's the way it usually worked with me,
the farther away I was from my family the closer I felt to
them.


Korama and I rode the subway from the airport to the
station closest to The Ivy. Jade met us there and drove us the
rest of the way. I hadn't even stepped over the threshold of
the front door when my mother greeted me with a critical
remark.


"Yuck," she said. "You're still wearing your hair like
that?"


She was referring to my new crop of baby dreadlocks.


"You look like a pineapple from the neck up," she continued.


Paula was standing beside Mum. She cut her eyes at her
and angrily rolled them skyward.


"Let it go," Jade whispered in my ear. "Take a deep
breath and let it go."


"I think your hair looks dope, Nana-Ama," Paula said as
she approached Korama and me. "It's growing so fast."

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Thanks Pooh," I said, entering the apartment. I gave
Mum a small hug.


It never failed; the minute I walked into that house, I always
went back to being sixteen and bitter.


While I was in town, my editor at <i>The Washington Post</i> took me to
lunch. I used the opportunity to try to land another freelance
assignment, but he hated all the ideas I pitched him.
Mostly, we chatted about our personal lives. Several segues
in the conversation landed us on the topic of phone sex.
While trading stories about the weird jobs we had each had,
I mentioned that I had once worked as a 976 operator. After
hearing this, he wouldn't let the subject drop. He wanted
me to tell all: how I had gotten involved in that industry,
what kind of calls I had taken, how much I was paid, et
cetera, et cetera.


"That's your article right there," he said, after I had filled
him in on all the grisly details. I thought it was the funniest
thing I had ever heard.


"My article? You mean like a day in the life of a 976
worker? You can't be serious."


"Why not?" he asked. "It would be a fascinating story."


Never in a million years would I disclose something so
personal. I could see my mother's face already. She would
flip if after all those years of teaching me to not put my business
in the street, I got up and announced to the world that
I had faked orgasms and simulated fellatio on the telephone
for a living.


"I'm sure it would," I agreed "But I'm not going to be the

[p. <i>[181]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"They'll get over it," he said. "The first shock is the
hardest. Think about it, it'll be a great piece."


I agreed to think about it but, in my mind, I had pretty
much decided that I wouldn't do it.


It was nice to spend time with all my friends. Everyone kept
commenting about how much happier I looked and how
L.A. must be treating me right.


"Oh, it is," I told them all. "I have never been happier in
my life." Of course it was a lie, but the truth would have
been a boring extension of the emotional hardships they
had grown accustomed to hearing me talk about. It sickened
me to hear myself complaining over and over again about
the same problems. Problems that never went away; problems
that apparently had no solutions. I sometimes wondered
how many of them really listened anymore when I
talked about my never-ending discontent.


Being with my friends so much left me little time to
spend with Mum and Paula.


"This isn't the Holiday Inn," Mum complained. "It
would be nice if you stayed in one night. Why can't your
friends visit you here?"


She had a point. I took it for granted that I would see
Mum and Paula because I was staying there. It wasn't intentional.
If Mum hadn't brought it to my attention, I don't
think I would have noticed. My family had become so peripheral

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I ended up writing the article on my experience as a
phone sex worker. It was the lead piece in the Sunday "Outlook"
section of the paper. Both of my parents called and
raved about it, curiously sidestepping any discussion of its
content. How was it that the one thing I surely thought
would bring them shame ended up legitimizing me as a
writer in their eyes? No more questions about when I was
going to get a job. No more lectures about how writing was a
cute hobby but that I needed to have something to fall back
on. I was now their daughter, the writer. Their sudden
praise left me confused. Nevertheless, I seized their approval
and wore it proudly.


In late June, I traveled to D.C. again. A friend had given me
a frequent flyer award and I lied about Korama's age so that
she could fly free as a lap child. It was a short trip; we arrived
on Friday and left the following Monday. In that Sunday's
"Outlook" section of the <i>Post</i>, there was an article about depression
titled "In Black Despair." I almost didn't read it
because when I saw the headline I assumed it was a personal
essay by a white person and was immediately put off by the
way <i>black</i> had been coupled with <i>despair</i>. I despise the way
blackness, in the English language, symbolizes death and
negativity. Because I believe that the absorption of these
connotations contributes to self-hate, I avoid them at all
cost.

[p. <i>[183]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, when I noticed that the byline belonged to
Mary Ann French, a black woman, I started reading the article.
It was written on the heels of Washington, D.C.
Council chairman John Wilson's suicide. French set out to
examine the "plague of African American depression."
Plague?!? And here I was thinking that Jade, Patricia Bledsoe,
and I were anomalies. Never had I heard depression
being referred to as an issue concerning African Americans,
much less a plague. I was intrigued.


According to the article, John Wilson had hanged himself
in his house. French quoted from one of Wilson's last
speeches, which, ironically, was delivered at a meeting of
the D.C. Mental Health Association. In that speech, he
said, "Our kids are not crazy. They're not a generation of
lost people. They're a generation of people that need mental
health treatment to deal with depression because there's
so much in this world that they can never have, and they
know they will never have it, and it's putting them in a grand
funk."


I thought back to what Paula had said about all the young
kids that were dying; I wondered if mental illness factored
in their deaths or the lifestyles that led them to early graves.
I had recently read a lot of books about depression. All of
the narratives contained elements that resembled my own
experiences with the disorder. I often joked with Jade that
sometimes when I looked at the author photos on the back
of the books I half-expected to see her face or mine. But, of
course, I knew that could never happen because all of the
authors were white. Perhaps, unknowingly, what I was really

[p. <i>184</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The article affirmed the fact that there are indeed large
numbers of black people suffering from depression. But
why wouldn't there be? Depressive disorders do not discriminate
along color lines, people do. People determine
what is publicly acceptable and what is not, who may behave
in what way at which time and under which circumstances;
and these social mores spill over into our private lives, into
the images we create. White people take prescription drugs
with gentle, melodic names; they go to therapy once or twice
a week in nice, paneled offices. Black people take illicit
drugs with names as harsh as the streets on which they are
bought. We build churches and sing songs that tell us to "Go
Tell It on the Mountain." Either that or we march. Left,
right, left, from city to city, for justice and for peace. We are
the walking wounded. And we suffer alone because we don't
know that there are others like us.


Jade called to tell me about the article.


"Meri, there's a piece in the paper today. Did you—"


"Yeah," I interrupted. "I read it. What did you thin—"


"Good. Unbelievable," she said. "I've never..."


"Me neither," I whispered into her silence. "It was such a
shock..."


"Unbelievable," Jade sighed. "I was so happy to see it."


"I know," I said, fighting back tears. "Me, too. I was
happy, too."

[p. <i>[185]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My being in town at the same time that the article ran was
simply too much of a coincidence to dismiss. I saw it as a
sign to get my butt into therapy, to do whatever it took to get
well. I clipped the article and folded it away into the side
compartment of my purse. At the airport the next day, I
pulled it out and re-read it as I awaited the final boarding
call for our flight. Patricia Bledsoe came to mind. With all
the political work she had done, she must have surely been
acquainted with John Wilson. Perhaps they had even been
friends. I wondered if either of them had known that the
other was suffering from depression. Somehow, I doubted
it. They probably ran into each other at different soirees
and political functions, smiled hello or even chatted
briefly, neither realizing that the other shared their private
hell.


I walked to a pay phone and dialed Patricia Bledsoe's
number. I hadn't seen or talked to her since Eugene's visit.
For so long, he had been telling me to call her, talk to her. I
didn't know what I was going to say, but I had an urge to
reach out. Maybe I would talk to her about the article, ask
her about John Wilson's death, anything. I just wanted to
make a connection. After one ring, I lost my nerve. Before
anyone could answer, I returned the phone to its hook and
fetched my quarter from the coin return slot.


WHILE EVERYONE IN L.A. basked in the summer sun, I
became a hermit. My agoraphobia was worse than ever. I

[p. <i>186</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00183&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Paula came to spend her summer vacation with Korama
and me. She and I were long overdue for some quality time.
When she got there, I started to regret having invited her.
My financial situation was still shaky and the apartment was
much too small for three people. I was used to having the
place all to myself when Korama was at preschool. I was
moody and irritable. Paula walked on eggshells around me
and did not speak unless it was in response to something I
said. I nagged and fussed at her all day, every day, finding
fault with everything she did. What especially irked me was
that she woke up too late and stayed in bed too long.


Four long, miserable days into her vacation, we got into a
huge blow-out. She had spent the afternoon in the bedroom
watching soap opera after soap opera. I sat in the living
room reading a book that I was supposed to review. The
TV was too loud; I was having trouble concentrating on my
work. Paula came out of the bedroom and went into the
kitchen for a snack. She stood in front of the refrigerator
and stared into it for a good long while before closing it and
returning, empty-handed, to the bedroom. I could tell she
was bored. I felt guilty about behaving so selfishly. The poor
girl had come at my request. She had no friends in L.A.,
nowhere to go, nothing to do. It was cruel of me to let her sit
around alone and lonely all day.

[p. <i>[187]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went into the bedroom and watched the rest of the soap
with her. When it was over, I turned off the television and
asked her if she wanted to do something like take a walk
down Melrose Avenue and windowshop.


"I don't feel like it," she said.


"Well, what do you feel like doing?" I asked.


"I'm cool doing what I was doing," she said, turning the
television back on. My guilt turned to frustration. Her indifference
frightened and infuriated me. She reminded me
of myself when I was in the midst of a depressive episode.


"What the hell is wrong with you?" I asked. "You mope
around here all day like a chained puppy that wants to be let
out, then when I try to take you somewhere, you don't want
to go."


Paula was astounded, but not intimidated. She kept direct
eye contact as I ranted and raved about how I was doing
my best and the least she could do was meet me halfway.
When I was done, she said, in a spine-tingling voice, "You
say you understand, but you don't. You are just like everyone
else. I'm leaving."


"I am not like everyone else," I yelled, figuring that the
everyone else she meant was our parents. "What's that supposed
to mean, anyway?"


Paula didn't say another word. She went through the
room, collecting her belongings and throwing them into
her suitcase. I convinced her, with apologies and promises,
to stay.


I had no idea that Paula also suffered from bouts of clinical
depression. At the time, neither did she. What I did

[p. <i>188</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00185&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went into therapy. It was the only sensible solution. The
corner into which I had backed myself was getting too tight.
I had been lying to my friends and family, telling them how
incredibly happy and fulfilling my life in L.A. was. And they
were all so proud of me. They thought I had finally found
my way. I didn't want to break down and tell them the truth,
that I was hurting, in a bad way. Even if I had wanted to,
there was no one to talk to. All my friends were busy with
their own lives and their own problems.


Now that Eugene was living with his girlfriend, he wasn't
as accessible. Scott was in and out of court with his landlord
every other week; and, as usual, Jade rarely returned my
phone calls. David was not easy to reach. He was in Boston,
working a grueling schedule as a broadcast news producer.
Even if I was able to get a hold of him, I wouldn't know
where to begin. He didn't know anything about my depressions.
I had deliberately withheld that one tidbit of information
from him. It just felt like too much to place on an
already overloaded friendship. Besides, since seventh grade,
he had done his fair share of listening to me.


I knew very little about psychotherapy, although I did
hold the preconceived notion that it was an expensive indulgence.
Hoping I could find something within my financial
reach, I first tried the social services programs, many of
which were geared toward low-income people, such as myself.

[p. <i>[189]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finding a private therapist in L.A. was a piece of cake.
Next to plastic surgeons and personal trainers, they were
the top miracle workers. It seemed as if everyone I met
began at least one sentence in a conversation with, "My
therapist says ..." All I would have to do was wait for someone
to make a remark about their therapist and then casually
ask for a referral. I did and I struck oil on the first try.
Someone referred me to a therapist whose fees were on a
sliding scale.


I called the therapist, Sylvia Granderson. She informed me
that the lowest rate she could offer was fifty dollars for a
fifty-minute session. A dollar per minute! I was hoping her
scale would slide a little further down than that. Fifty dollars
was a small fortune for me, but I went ahead and made
an appointment. My first visit with Sylvia was remarkable.
She was a butch white lady in her early thirties. Her office,
which was small and nondescript, was a stone's throw from
my apartment. When I walked in the first thing I saw was a
couch. It took every ounce of courage I had to not turn
around and run. I nervously sat down and wrung my hands.
Sylvia sat on the chair at her desk and swiveled it around so
that she was facing me.


"Meri," she said in a tender, subdued voice, "do you want
to tell me why you're here?"

[p. <i>190</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00187&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I balled my hand into a fist, raised it up sideways to my
mouth and coughed.


"I don't really know," I answered. "I might be a little depressed.
I mean, I'm not feeling that great these days. What
I'm trying to say is that I-I-I ... I just need to talk to somebody."


"I'd like to help, if I can," she said with a smile. "What do
you want to talk about?"


I felt idiotic sitting in front of a woman that I knew nothing
about, telling her that I wanted to talk. It was uncomfortable.


"I don't know. Nothing really."


"I want to hear about what you're going through and the
reasons why you are here, but first I want to get some background
so that I can have a clear picture of where you are in
your life. Do you want to tell me about yourself?"


"Well," I hesitated. I didn't know what to tell her. It made
me self-conscious to think that everything I said would be
analyzed and scrutinized. I didn't want to say the wrong
thing. I thought and thought about where to begin and then
I saw the clock on her wall and remembered she was charging
me by the minute. Ten had already flown by.


"Sure," I finally said. "I was born in Ghana. My whole
family is from there. I came here when I was six. America
that is, not L.A."


"Where did you grow up?"


It felt like I was on the witness stand being cross-examined.
I was tense and on guard, but I slowly started opening
up. I told Sylvia about most of my early childhood, especially

[p. <i>[191]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00188&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next session was hard. Sylvia wanted me to talk more
about my family. I started with Paula. I told Sylvia about
how we had been able to turn around what had started out
to be a horrible summer vacation. Besides Korama, I said,
Paula was the most special person in my life.


"And your parents?" she asked.


"What about them?"


"What is your relationship like with them?" she asked.


"It's ..." I couldn't think of an appropriate word. "It's
there."


"There?" she asked. "You mentioned that they were divorced.
Let's talk about them individually. What is your relationship
like with your father?"


"We have an okay relationship," I said, and then quickly
took it back. "That's not really true. We talk sometimes, but
it's difficult. I've never forgiven him for leaving my
mother, for leaving me."


"Have you told him how you feel?" she asked.


"Are you kidding?" I laughed. "I used to yell and cuss
and scream at him so much when I was younger, it's a wonder
he still talks to me." I leaned back and started untying
my shoelaces. Suddenly I was feeling confined. "It was hard,

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00189&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"It sounds like you're very protective of your mother,"
Sylvia said. "Tell me about her."


"She's ... she's ...," My mind, my heart, everything
shut down. I went blank.


"She was a good mother," I finally spit out. My throat was
parched and my hands were trembling.


"Can I get some water?" I asked. Sylvia stepped out of the
room and came back with a glass of water.


"Are you alright?" I nodded as I drank. "Do you harbor
resentment and anger toward your mother as well?"


"No," I snapped. "Anger? Why would I be angry at her?
She's all I've ever had." Then I started crying. I was sobbing
so hard that my nose started running and a pain settled in
my head, right between my eyes. "I don't feel like I really
know her. She worked a lot. She had to. My father wasn't
around and we needed the money. It was like after Daddy
left, we weren't a family anymore. We were just there. How
could I be angry at her for that? It wasn't her fault."


I couldn't stop crying. My head felt like a huge water bubble
that was about to explode. I had gone from feeling nothing at
all, to being overloaded with emotions I didn't understand.
Sylvia handed me a tissue and gave me a moment to regain my
composure. My full-lunged gasps were soon replaced by
slower, calmer breaths. I was so embarrassed about breaking
down like that, I couldn't even look at Sylvia. I stared at the
pink triangle charm hanging on her necklace.


"I'm sorry," I said. "I don't know what came over me. I
seem to be crying over the dumbest things lately."

[p. <i>[193]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00190&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You don't have to apologize," she said. "It's quite alright.
We can continue this discussion next week. Before we
end this session, I want you to tell me how you've been feeling.
Last week you said that you thought you might be depressed.
Tell me about how you generally feel from day to
day."


I started crying again.


"I'm tired," I told her through the tears. "I'm so tired of
everything. I feel like I just want the world to stop spinning
for a while so I can take a break."


She turned to her desk and wrote down something on a
sheet of paper.


"I don't know how much you know about depression,"
she said, handing me the paper, "but it is a medical condition,
a disease. However, depression is treatable. Psychiatrists
are medical doctors who specialize in the field of
mental health; they can prescribe medication. I'm a psychologist.
These are a few of the doctors that I sometimes
work with. I want you to go and get an examination from
one of them before our next session. They'll talk to you and
decide which antidepressant will be best for you."


"Antidepressant?" I asked. All I wanted to do was get
therapy, talk through my problems. I felt like I had failed
some sort of test. Maybe I shouldn't have brought up the
word depression. "You want me to take Prozac?"


"Prozac is not the only antidepressant," she explained.
"There are many, many others. I am sure the psychiatrist
will go over all your options with you."


"Okay," I said, glancing at the names she had written

[p. <i>194</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00191&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In late August, I found a job. It was as the Membership/Program
Coordinator for PEN Center USA West, the writers'
organization. Based on the job description, I thought it was
going to be a high-level position but it turned out to be
nothing more than a secretarial job with a big title. To top it
off, the work atmosphere was stifling. I hated being there,
but I desperately needed the money.


Because cars are such a necessity in Los Angeles, I used
the first few paychecks I got to buy one, a red 1983 Mazda
626. It ended up being my home away from home. At 7:30
I would wake up and from that moment on, I was on the go.
Korama had to be dropped off at preschool by 8:30 so that
I could get to work by 9:00. When my workday was over at
5:30, I would drive crosstown, pick Korama up at 6:00 and
head home to fix dinner and finish up whatever freelance
article I was writing. The routine was exhausting. I felt like a

[p. <i>[195]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00192&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When push came to shove, I beat up on myself for not
being able to get with the program. After all, I'd tell myself, I
was not the first woman to work and raise a child simultaneously.
Black women have been doing that for ages, with and
without partners. Some even held down two jobs while raising
three and four children. No one ever made mention of
these women griping about depression. It was a luxury that
they couldn't afford. What made me think I was so special?


In the evenings while I was lying in bed, trying to invent
ways to make myself fall asleep, I thought about going back
to therapy. But not with Sylvia. If I could find another reasonably
priced therapist who wouldn't attempt to push
shrinks and pills on me, I might just give it a second try. For
several days I tossed the idea around in my head. The final
decision was no, I would not see another therapist. There
wasn't an hour to spare in my schedule and fifty bucks was
too much money to spend to hear myself talk about myself.
Besides, my friends were still there. True, they weren't impartial
or licensed, but they listened and they cared. Especially
Jade. She did more than console or empathize, she
knew. She knew firsthand.


When I called Jade, her sister, Monica, answered. Jade wasn't
home so Monica took a message and said she would pass
it on to Jade.

[p. <i>196</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00193&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"It might be a while before she gets back to you," she said.


"Is she out of town?" I asked. I told Monica to let Jade
know that it was urgent.


"Oh," she sighed. There was a pause on the other end of
the phone.


"Monica?" I asked. "Are you still there?"


"Yeah. I was thinking that ... I guess I can tell you. Jade
is, uhm, she's ..."


Jade was in a mental hospital. She had voluntarily
checked herself in and was going to be there indefinitely.


"I'll give you the number there," Monica said. "I'm sure
she'd love to hear from you."


Her words slowed and slurred in my ears, like a tape on
the wrong speed. Jade? In a mental hospital?


"Is she okay?" I asked.


"Yeah, she's doing fine."


It was a stupid answer to a stupid question. Fine? How
could she be doing fine if she was in a mental hospital? I was
bending over backward trying to figure out why Jade would
check herself into the loony bin. It was too difficult for me
to believe that she was that far gone. Not that I had ever
taken Jade's depression lightly. One of the things that I admired
—and envied—most about her was that she was honest
and up-front about it. Whenever she told me she was "going
through it," I cleared the way and gave her space. Jade had
an immense expanse of sadness. I understood that. I even
partially understood her impulse for suicide. But hospitalization?

[p. <i>[197]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00194&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"She's doing <i>fine</i>?" I asked skeptically.


"As fine as she can be doing under the circumstances,"
Monica said. "Call her."


Monica gave me the number to the hospital and told me
the best times to call. The thought of calling a mental hospital
made me uncomfortable. I pinned the number up on
my corkboard, knowing that sooner or later I would have to
make the call. Had Jade been in the hospital for any other
reason, I would have dialed that number without a second's
hesitation, but since the cause for her admission was depression,
it scared me. After months of pointing out the
concentricity of our lives, I felt quite justified in my fear.
Less than a year before, Jade had sat in my living room and
said, "I'm not crazy. Well, no more than you." And I had
believed her, because when I looked at her, it was so easy to
see myself. God, if she was sick enough to be hospitalized,
what did that say about me?


The next day I forced myself to make the call. My fear was
secondary to my love. If I was ever in a similar situation, I
would hope that my friends would be there for me. I expected
a nurse to answer the phone, but the voice on the
other end was Jade's. She didn't sound any different from
her usual self.


"Jade?" I asked.


She recognized my voice right away.


"Meri," she crooned excitedly.


I pictured her lying on a twin-sized bed with starched

[p. <i>198</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"They give you guys your own phone lines?"


No hello, how are you doing, just a straight nose dive into
the Bedlam and Thorazine questions.


"No," she laughed. "I'm in the phone room, which is actually
a hallway. This isn't Club Med, you know. It's good to
hear your voice. How are you?"


"I'm doing fine. How are you?"


"Fine."


Talk about social axioms. Neither of us was fine. I had
prepared myself for Jade to be reticent, catatonic, or maybe
even heavily sedated. She did sound subdued, but not
alarmingly so.


"How're those palm trees?"


"Beautiful as ever," I said, staring at the one outside my
window.


"I heard you've been calling. I'm sorry I haven't called
you back. I've been—"


"Going crazy?" I asked. It was probably an inappropriate
thing to say, but if Jade had been able to joke that night when
she was planning to commit suicide, I couldn't imagine her
not being able to now.


"This from the mouth of Miss Contrary herself," Jade
laughed.


"Hey, which one of us is wearing the straitjacket, huh?"
We jumped into our regular comical groove, as if all was
well, as if we were sitting on the floor in my Mt. Pleasant living

[p. <i>[199]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00196&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Before we got off the phone, Jade made me promise that
I would get back into therapy. I gave her my word and, despite
my reservations, I kept it. Seeing a therapist paled in
comparison to being in a psych ward. I called Cedars-Sinai,
the hospital where Korama was born, to see what type of
mental health programs they offered. Cedars was known for
its substance abuse programs. I figured that any place that
dealt with addiction had to also offer therapy. I registered at
Thalians, Cedars' mental health clinic, which, thankfully,
offered a sliding payment scale. I paid twenty-two dollars
and fifty cents for each visit.


Apparently, a good number of the therapists at Thalians
were in training, and their session hours went toward their
certification process. Incoming patients were assessed in a
preliminary session and then routed off, based on their
condition or problem, to a therapist who specialized in that
particular field. Getting to therapy was tricky for me. Timing
was an unconquerable obstacle. My regular child-care
was during standard business hours. Evening sessions
meant finding after-hours child-care. Daytime sessions
meant taking a two-hour lunch. Either way, being in therapy
was going to cost me a lot of money, above and beyond
the session fee.


Shelly, the first therapist I saw, was a young, white, Australian
woman. Her accent endeared her to me. It reminded me of

[p. <i>200</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00197&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My visits with Shelly were more like an afternoon tea with
a friend, except, of course, I was paying to be there. She and
I discussed my writing, my family, my romances, and the
weather. I kept silent about the tedious turmoil that was
knotting up my insides. One afternoon I arrived at Shelly's
office looking as horrible as I felt. I had called in sick to
work. My eyes were red from crying and lack of sleep; my
head hurt so bad it felt like someone was drilling a hole in it.


"I can't do this anymore," I cried. "I need help."


"What's going on? Talk to me about it," she said, her intonations
curling upwards with surprise.


"I'm talked out, lady. I haven't had a good night's sleep in
weeks; I can't eat; I can't concentrate. What can you possibly
say in the next forty-five minutes that will change that? I
don't even know why I bothered to come today."


I picked up my things to leave.


"Where are you going?" she asked.


"I'd say hell, but I'm already there. You'll excuse me if
I'm not up to chatting today."


"Wait," she said, picking up the telephone. "Don't leave.
Let me page the psychiatrist on duty. He might be able to
help you."


I stayed. Not because I wanted to, but because I couldn't

[p. <i>[201]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00198&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Fitzgerald, the psychiatrist, did not physically examine
me. Not that day, or any other day. Based only on my description
of the symptoms I was experiencing, he told me
that I should be taking an antidepressant. Dr. Fitzgerald explained
that once I started taking the pills, it could take
anywhere from two to six weeks for them to take effect, but
when they did, the physical symptoms of depression would
be alleviated. He warned me of the potential side effects—
dry mouth, excessive yawning, possible weight gain, and a
multitude of other things that seemed, at the time, a small
sacrifice for the freedom I would have from depression.


After I signed a consent form, Dr. Fitzgerald wrote out a
prescription for Zoloft, an antidepressant drug in the same
family as Prozac. When I told him I couldn't afford to have the
prescription filled right away, he gave me ten sample packages.

[p. <i>202</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00199&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

FOR THE FIRST week, I took one 50-milligram pill of
Zoloft each morning. In the second week, I followed Dr.
Fitzgerald's instructions and doubled the dosage to 100 milligrams.
As forewarned, I suffered from dry mouth and
yawning. The medicine also made me feel woozy and lightheaded.
I had this sensation of experiencing the world
through a dream-like haze, like I had stepped into a painting.
These side effects only lasted a couple of weeks and then
they disappeared, taking with them my ability to experience
any emotions in extremity. Except anxiety. I stayed uncontrollably
nervous and edgy.


I had always thought that the opposite of depression was
happiness, that once you stopped feeling bad, you automatically
started feeling good. That's not what happened to me.
Once I started taking Zoloft, there was no good or bad, I
just stopped feeling. It was like being glued on top of the
fence that separated pain from pleasure; nothing could
transport me to the other side, either side. My mind could
no longer access my heart, even in circumstances that would
have ordinarily moved me to tears or laughter.


When I met with Dr. Fitzgerald again, I told him all about
it. In addition to my weekly therapy sessions with Shelly, I
had one session with Dr. Fitzgerald every two weeks so that
he could monitor my response to the medication. He offered

[p. <i>[203]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00200&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Some patients," he said, "react to Zoloft that way. The
medication prevents them from reaching extreme lows, but
it also prevents them from reaching extreme highs. I
wouldn't worry too much if I were you. It's perfectly normal.
It may pass. Let's give it some time."


"Alright," I said, "but there's another problem. The
Zoloft's making me really jumpy. I feel like I just drank two
pots of super strong coffee."


For my uncontrollable nervousness, Dr. Fitzgerald offered
more medication. He gave me a prescription for
BuSpar, an anxiety controllant. Because I couldn't afford
to fill that prescription either, he gave me sample packages.
Damn, I thought, more pills. How many damn pills would I
have to swallow before I felt like a regular person again?


The financial strain that treating the depression put me
under was enough to push me into a whole new depression.
Seeing Shelly cost $22.50 a week; Dr. Fitzgerald's visits cost
$13.00 each. When I ran out of the sample packages of
Zoloft, I filled the prescription, which was for thirty-days'
worth of pills. It cost me a little under $75. Had I filled the
prescription for BuSpar, that would have cost me $130, but
I didn't. When the BuSpar samples ran out I found another
way to treat the anxiety—alcohol. It got the job done and it
wasn't as hard on the pocket.


While I was taking Zoloft, I wasn't able to write a word,
much less a poem or essay, unless I was drinking. It's difficult
to be passionate or polemic when you're desensitized.

In her essay "Moving Targets: Alcohol, Crack and Black
Women,"
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_54602');">[note]</a><div id="_note_54602" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗<i>The Black Women's Health Book</i>, edited by Evelyn C. White. Seattle, WA: Seal
Press, 1994, p. 252.</div>
Sheila Battle, MSW, claims that "studies show a
higher prevalence of ‘escape alcoholism’ among black
women. In other words, drinking that numbs them from
the many griefs, sorrows and disappointments that color
black female lives.... [B]ecause they often have full responsibility
for their families and feel they must carry on no
matter what, black women are even more likely to minimize
the negative impact of alcohol in their lives." In my mind,
drinking was helping, not hurting, me. Soon enough
though, it tore my world to shreds.


I resigned from my job at PEN. I made the mistake of being

My former job as a creative writing instructor became
available. Rebecca Freemont, the writer who took over
when I moved back to D.C. was relocating to New York. I
reapplied for the position. It was just part-time teaching,
but it was better than nothing. Two nights a week, I left
Korama with a babysitter and drove to Manhattan Beach,
California, to teach. Rebecca also let me lease her house,
a two-bedroom with a white picket fence and a small backyard.
It was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. The money
I would be receiving for teaching my workshops was a
hundred dollars shy of the monthly rent. I wasn't sure
how I was going to make up the difference, or pay for my
other bills, but, in prime Meri fashion, I took the leap
and waited to see whether I would fall or fly.

On Halloween of 1993, Harold and I packed up my
apartment and drove the boxes across town to yet another
new residence. While putting away the bags of perishables
that Harold had brought in his carload, I found an unopened
bottle of vodka in the freezer. I didn't drink hard
liquor so I handed it to Harold.


"No thanks," he said, returning it to me. "I'm not a big
vodka drinker. I don't really need to have that lying around
my house."


"Just take it," I demanded, shoving the bottle back into
Harold's hands, "At least you drink it sometimes. I don't
drink it at all. It burns going down. Might as well be
sterno."


Harold opened the freezer and put the bottle back in.


"I'll grab it before I leave."


Of course he left without the vodka, and it stayed in the
freezer, untouched, for many months.


To compensate for the isolation of living so far from my
friends, every month I threw a party at my new house. When
one party was over and done with, I spent the next three
weeks preparing for the next one. It kept me occupied and
out of trouble. It was also a way to make sure that my name
was still floating through the artists' circle. So much of the
networking and contact-making that artists do takes place at
social events. Because I was at home with a child, there was
no way I could attend the readings, premiers, and other
functions to which I was invited. When Korama was an infant,
I brought her along to these events, but as she grew
older and refused to sit still, it became more and more of a

[p. <i>[207]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00204&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the end of the year, Shelly finished her training. When I
began therapy no one at the clinic cared enough to fill me in
on the fact that I would lose the one person with whom I felt
comfortable enough to confide. Being that a good number
of people in therapy are tackling issues of abandonment,
one would imagine that a clinic's administrators would advise
prospective patients that their therapist could pick up at
any minute and leave. I went to a session with Shelly and
found out that it would be our last. She had taken a position
with a therapy center in Santa Monica. Shelly told me that
because of the nature of the therapist/patient relationship,
she was able to offer me the option of continuing treatment
with her at her new place of employment. It all sounded well
and good until she told me that her new fee at her new place
of employment would be a staggering $150 an hour.


"If you decide to continue here," she said, "you'll be reassigned
to a new therapist. I don't know who it'll be, but all
the residents here are caring and competent."


Caring and competent? What were we talking about
here, plumbers? She was acting like she could be replaced
with anybody who was qualified to do the job. I wanted to
slap her. I wanted to take back every confession, every intimate
moment I had ever shared with her. While I understand
the intellectual premise behind teaching hospitals
where trainees can receive "hands-on" experience with patients,

[p. <i>208</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00205&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I don't want to start all over again with someone else," I
told her. "I don't care how caring or competent they are.
They don't know me."


"Your next therapist will have background notes," she assured
me. "It'll probably take just two or three sessions for
them to get up to speed."


Notes? My life was being reduced to notes? I had never
even seen Shelly taking notes during our sessions. In my
mind, I could picture my prospective therapist eating corn
chips at her desk while flipping through a folder full of
hastily collected afterthoughts about me. Assuming that my
new therapist was a woman. It could very well be a man. That
got me thinking: Would my new therapist be black or white?
Foreign or American-born? A parent or childless? These
were important questions about even more important details.
Shelly had no answers.


"I don't know," she said. "But if, for some reason, you
don't like him or her, you can request to be reassigned."


"Reassigned?" I shouted. "What if I don't like the next person?
Do I ask to be reassigned again? I could spend the next
year trying out new therapists. And let me guess, I'm supposed
to pay for it all, too. That's really fucked up, you know."


"Meri," Shelly pleaded, "please don't let this stop you

[p. <i>[209]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00206&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No," I sighed. "<i>We</i>'ve been making great progress. No
matter what kind of professional lingo you try to veil this
with, it basically boils down to the fact that you're walking
out on me. You're leaving, just like everyone else in my life
has."


Shelly knew as well as I did that I would not return the
next week to meet the new therapist. That seemed to trouble
her more than it did me. I could see it in her eyes; I could
hear it in her voice. All the training in the world could not
have prepared her for this moment, for all the moments
when she realized that despite her expert detachment, she
had grown to care about her clients; she was just as attached
to us as we were to her. It was obvious that saying goodbye
was hard for her, too.


Shelly's departure left me feeling wounded and betrayed.
How exactly does one mourn the loss of one's therapist?
It's not like losing a friend or a lover. There is
nothing to validate the emptiness that you feel inside; no
poems, no songs on the radio, no made-for-TV specials.
When you think about it, there is nothing really to affirm
the depth of the relationship you once had or, that it was
even a relationship at all. Relationships are based upon
some sort of reciprocity. Generally, therapy is treated as a
paid association, an agreement, not an authentic human
relationship. So what if your therapist gets ill, takes a new
position elsewhere, or drops dead? Big deal. Take your
Kleenex, your checkbook, your dysfunctions, and go find

[p. <i>210</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00207&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My case was reassigned to a new therapist, but I didn't show
up for my appointment. I did, however, continue taking the
Zoloft and seeing Dr. Fitzgerald. I also continued to drink.
The only time that I felt like myself, the self with which I was
familiar, was when I was under the influence of alcohol. I
became a pro at self-medicating. I found that if I measured
the amount of alcohol I took in, I could manipulate my
body to the point where I was fully functional, but not fully
depressed.


All urban black neighborhoods are polluted with cheap
liquor stores. The one in which I lived was no exception.
There were three within a four-block radius. They became
my main haunts. Everyday, I went and bought a six-pack of
beer. When I couldn't afford the brand-name beers, I experimented
with cheap, drink-alone-sized bottles of wine,
which smelled like nail polish remover and made me sick.
Since I no longer worked a nine-to-five, my schedule was
free and clear during the days. In the mornings after I
dropped Korama off at preschool, I usually returned home
and had a drink or two or six. That was the only way I could
bring myself to sit down and write. One day after I had returned
from dropping Korama, Paula called—collect. I had
emptied the contents of my purse on the floor and was sitting
there counting the change to see if I could swing a six-pack.


"This is not a good time," I told Paula. "I'm in the middle
of something important."

[p. <i>[211]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00208&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I'm sorry," she said. "I really need to talk to you."


"What's wrong, Pooh? Why aren't you in school?"


I was jittery. My throat was parched and itchy. All I
wanted was to feel an ice cold liquid sliding into it. I picked
up two quarters from the pile of coins and placed them one
on top of the other, then I started picking out the nickels.


"I am at school," she answered. "It's lunchtime."


"How's school?" I asked, feigning interest.


"It's okay. The reason I called is that I wanted to ask you a
question. I started going to therapy, you know, 'cause I've
been feeling so bad ..."


She paused for a response. I remained inattentive.


"Uh-huh," I mumbled. I placed the twelve nickels that I
found in a stack next to the quarters and started looking for
dimes.


"Anyway," Paula continued, "my therapist wants to put
me on this medicine. She says that she can't do it unless she
has legal consent from an adult. Mommy and Daddy don't
know about it yet. I was wondering what you thought. Have
you ever heard of ... wait a second ... let me get this piece
of paper."


"Uh-huh," I repeated. There were only five dimes. That,
in combination with the single dollar bill I had in my hip
pocket would barely buy me a pack of cigarettes. "Here it
is," Paula said. "It's called Zoloft."


Hearing that word brought me to attention. I dropped
the pennies that were in my hand and sat up straight.


"Did you say Zoloft?" I asked. "What about Zoloft? I'm
lost. Can you start from the beginning again?"

[p. <i>212</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00209&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Realizing that I hadn't been listening, she let out a sigh
and begrudgingly repeated her story.


Inspired by a lengthy and crippling period of depression,
Paula, who was seventeen at the time, had taken the initiative
to find a therapist. She ended up going to a low-cost
health facility. The therapist who met with her was so impressed
by her courage and conviction that she reduced the
clinic's fee to one dollar per visit so that Paula would be able
to afford sessions. After several visits, the therapist diagnosed
her as being clinically depressed and recommended
that she take antidepressants.


There is no way to describe how I felt when I heard Paula
talk to me about her own battle with depression. I was sad; I
was furious; I was concerned; I was frightened. Two people
—two sisters—in the same family were being debilitated
by the exact same disease. What did that mean? Was it bad
genes or bad luck? Or a bad combination of both? It didn't
matter. There was little solace in realizing that the illness
might be genetic. A profound sadness moved through me.
Even those pills that I dutifully swallowed every morning
were not a strong enough barricade against the agony.


If there was ever a time when Paula needed my honesty, it
was then. I told her that I, too, had received the same diagnosis
and was taking Zoloft. She was as stunned by my confession
as I had been by hers. I hadn't told anyone in our
family about my illness. Like the sexual abuse, it remained
my secret. My conversation with Paula was cut short because
the lunch bell rang summoning her to return to class.

[p. <i>[213]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00210&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When she got home from school, she called me back, and
we spoke at length.


"Does Mum know?" I asked her.


"Not yet," she said.


"Are you going to tell her?" I wanted to know.


"I have to. That's the only way I can get this prescription
filled. Are you going to tell her about you?"


"I don't think so," I said. "At least, not for awhile."


Through the static of the ten years and three thousand
miles that stood between us, we discussed symptoms, psychiatrists,
side effects, and suicide attempts.


As we shared our feelings, Paula and I bonded in much
the same way that Jade and I had bonded during our first
conversation about depression. There is a comfort that
comes from talking to someone who is or has "been there."
It provides you with a lens through which you can examine
your own inner struggle. The illness so quickly clouds one's
memories and perceptions that it's easy to lose track of the
details of your suffering, the incidents that triggered an
episode, which symptom came first, how long the episodes
were, what past pleasures had been relinquished.


I never thought that one day my sister and I would be
adding clinical depression to the list of things we had in
common. Never could I have imagined that I would hear my
sister say, "Me, too," in response to my explanations of the
feelings I'd felt, the dismal places they had taken me. I would
have given all the money I had, all those pennies, nickels,
dimes, and quarters spread out before me, to make it not so.


Whatever heroic desires I might have had to rescue my sister

[p. <i>214</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00211&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Several dreary days went by before I went in for my regular
appointment with Dr. Fitzgerald. When I mentioned to
him that the medication wasn't working anymore, he increased
the dosage I was taking from 100 milligrams to 150.
I also told him about my conversation with Paula.


"That was a pretty traumatic discovery, wouldn't you say?
I'm sure it touches on a lot of sensitive issues. You should
discuss it with your therapist."


"My what?" I asked, kicking the heel of my right shoe
against the couch. It was against the clinic's policy to dispense
meds to clients who were not actively involved in psychotherapy.
I had never bothered to reschedule a session
with my new therapist.


"You seem a little anxious," Dr. Fitzgerald observed.
"Are you taking the BuSpar?"


"Yes," I lied, planting my feet firmly on the carpet. I was
embarrassed to admit that I couldn't afford to have the prescription
filled.


"Have you stopped drinking?"

[p. <i>[215]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00212&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I nodded and smiled, thinking that I could use a drink
right about then to calm my jitters. Our meeting took all of
twenty minutes, after which time Dr. Fitzgerald handed me
a new prescription for Zoloft and walked me to the door.


I was supposed to meet Eugene after my session with Dr.
Fitzgerald. He had given a lecture in San Diego and decided
to make a pit stop in L.A. on his way back to Minnesota.
When he was setting up his itinerary, we made plans to
spend one of the three days he was going to be in town together.
That seemed like an eternity ago. Now that the time
had arrived, I didn't much feel like being in anyone's company,
but I had to go. A last-minute cancellation would
only rouse suspicion, especially with Eugene.


After I left the clinic I drove to the liquor store and
bought a small bottle of vodka, like the kind they sell on airplanes.
I then went to a drive-through McDonald's, ordered
a large cup of juice, tossed half of it out onto the
grass, and poured in the vodka. By the time I arrived at the
hotel where Eugene was staying, I was lit. I could see him
through the plate glass window, pacing the lobby floor. As I
walked through the front door, Eugene approached me
with open arms.


"Hey," I said, kissing him on the cheek.


He backed away from me and grimaced.


"What's wrong?" I asked.


"Nothing," he said, giving me a hug. "Nothing at all.
What time is it?"


"Ten-thirty. I know, I know, I'm late. What else is new?"

[p. <i>216</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00213&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Like most people who have had one too many, I wasn't
aware of my own level of intoxication. I was certainly much
too tipsy to be behind the wheel of a car. Eugene grabbed my
arm.


"We don't have to leave so soon. We can go up to my room
and catch up."


"I don't want to hang out in a hotel room. I thought you
were treating me to breakfast."


"It's too late for breakfast. Let's wait until noon and have
lunch."


With the utmost precision, Eugene coaxed me into spending
the next two hours with him at the hotel, which was as
basic and no-frills as a Motel 6.


"Do they have room service here?" I asked when we got up
to his room. "I want to order a drink."


"Nope, but even if they did, it's a little early to drink," he
said. "Some people are finishing their first cup of coffee."


"I guess you're right," I agreed.


He got up and poured me a cup of water from a pitcher
that was on top of the dresser. We sat down on his bed and
talked about everything under the sun except drinking and
depression. It was one of those ask-me-no-questions-I'll-tell-you-no-lies
scenarios. Finally at twelve-thirty, I jumped
up and grabbed my purse.


"I'm starving, Eugene. Let's go eat."


He tried to keep stalling, but I insisted. When we got to
the car, I unlocked the passenger door for him. He held on
to the handle and exhaled.

[p. <i>[217]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00214&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Maybe we could go somewhere around here. Aren't
there restaurants in walking distance?"


I drove to a cafe on Melrose Avenue because it was close
to Korama's preschool. I was fiending for a drink. When
the waiter came to our table, I ordered a beer with my meal.
Eugene frowned but said nothing. I got up and went to the
bathroom. When I returned our lunch had been served. I
was so hungry that I didn't notice until we were about to pay
the check that the waiter never brought my beer. Eugene
and I wasted away the rest of the afternoon strolling
through the shops along the avenue.


Korama, Eugene, and I went back to the house. Korama
watched a movie in her room. Eugene sat close beside me
like a parent sits beside a feverish infant, looking on tenderly,
with hope and disquiet reservation. Spending time
with a depressed person is enervating. It is as dangerous as
standing at the slippery edge of a precipice. When Eugene
looked at me, I wondered whether what he saw brought back
memories of his childhood and his mother's illness during
that time.


"How's your mom?" I asked.


"It's winter," was all he said. And, indeed, that was all he
had to say. We sat in an awkward silence for some time. I
wondered why, after all he had been through with his
mother, Eugene welcomed another depressive into his life.
Wasn't he afraid of the consequences? How did he escape
the contagious effects of mental illness?


"I guess I'm just lucky," he said, brushing off my questions
with a slow wave of his hand and a fast change of the subject.

[p. <i>218</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00215&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I climbed into bed and stared at the ceiling for hours. I
doubt that there is anything more annoying than wanting to
fall asleep and not being able to. I got up and tip-toed into
the kitchen to fix myself a drink with my ever-faithful bottle
of vodka. A wave of panic came over me when I remembered
that Korama had finished off the orange juice with dinner. I
searched the refrigerator like a thief, hoping to find a suitable
replacement, but came up with only milk and water. I
rummaged through the cupboards and found something
that looked like it might work—canned peaches. I opened the
can and, using my fingers, pulled each peach slice out and
tossed it into the sink. The syrup in the tin was thick. I didn't
bother transferring it into a cup. I poured water and vodka
into the syrup, stirred and drank straight from the tin.


I moved through the dark kitchen as quietly as a mouse so
as not to wake Eugene. I wouldn't have known what to say if
he had found me there in my pajamas, clutching a can filled

[p. <i>[219]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00216&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"So I am," I whispered into the darkness. The gravity of
the admission hit me after it slipped out of my mouth. If I
was an alcoholic, that meant I would have to join A.A. and
give up alcohol forever. Forever! No more beers in the
middle of a sweltering July. No more mimosas at Sunday
brunch. No more red wine with pasta. Damn, how had it
come to this? No, I thought, I'm not an alcoholic. Here I
was, someone who didn't like hard liquor, pressing my lips
into the jagged blades of a hard metal rim for a taste of
booze. If that wasn't alcoholism, then what was?


I polished off the last of the vodka, but still didn't fall
asleep. If I learned anything that night it was that insomnia
is far worse to contend with when you're drunk. At about
half-past six, I heard Eugene walking around the house. It
was music to my ears. I threw off the covers and ran into the
living room.


"Good morning," I sang. "Do you want me to fix you
something?"


In an almost manic state, I raced to the kitchen to make
us breakfast. After we ate, I stood up and started to clear the
dishes from the table.


"Man, Meri," Eugene said. "What's going on with you?
Why have you been drinking so much?"


I blew out a short breath and sniffed slightly to see
whether I could smell alcohol on my breath. Sure enough, I
smelled like a distillery.


"I don't know," I said. I plopped myself back onto the

[p. <i>220</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00217&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"When did you start drinking like that?" he asked.


"I don't remember. Three, maybe four months ago."


Eugene, refusing to accept that I was an alcoholic, came
up with a probable explanation: Zoloft. I had been taking
the drug for the same length of time.


"Stop taking it," he advised. "That's one way to find out if
it's the cause of your drinking."


"If I stop taking my medicine, I'll get depressed again," I
complained. "Christmas is in a few weeks. I don't want to be
depressed."


"Drinking will get you depressed again," he countered.


"I'll call my shrink and ask him whether I can stop."


"<i>Ask</i>?" he snapped. "You'd better call that man and <i>tell</i>
him you need to stop. Why do you give people so much
power over you? That M.Dd behind his name just means
that he's trained to facilitate your healing. You're the one
who's actually got to make it happen. Therapy doesn't work
unless you know what you want out of it. You're the one who
has the power to change things."


The firmness in his voice startled me. Eugene had always
pushed hard and been somewhat of a bully. That approach
could easily have shattered another person, but it worked
well with me since I'm stubborn. However, this determination
seemed to be coming from some other place. He was
displaying a level of personal investment in my wellness that
I had never noticed before. Certainly I had always felt that
he cared, but all the prior lectures and advice he gave me

[p. <i>[221]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00218&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As soon as I stopped taking the Zoloft, I stopped drinking.
It took a couple of weeks for the medicine to wear out of my
system, but once it did, the desire to drink was completely
gone. I don't know why the Zoloft affected me so adversely,
that is, if it really did. I have often considered the possibility
that maybe I was not ready to not be depressed, that
maybe as much as I hated my moods, I had come to rely on
them. They were the legs with which I had learned to walk.
The alcohol, I suppose, was my crutch.


Antidepressants, Dr. Fitzgerald explained, are like any
other medication—one brand does not suit all. He urged
me to try out another medication to see if I would get better
results than I had with the Zoloft. Since my initial venture
into the world of psychopharmacology had gone awry, I was
unenthusiastic about making a second one. If anything, I
used my Zoloft ordeal to dismiss the probability that there
was a medication out there that might very well work for me.
Like the proverbial little engine that could, I went back
once more to believing that I could kick this thing by myself.


Many depressives resist and refuse medication in hopes
that they can "cure" themselves. I learned this when, after

[p. <i>222</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00219&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At first, the depression that followed my detox from alcohol
and Zoloft was not severe. There were no major
episodes, only regular ups and downs, which, in and of
themselves, were a sort of low-grade depression; but, overall,
I felt sturdy and secure in my emotions. I made it
through the holiday season, which has always been a hard
time for me.


After emerging from a prolonged period of inertia and
incapacity, one tends to want to make up for lost time.
There is something that needs to be proved, to oneself and
the entire world. It's an integral part of the cycle of depression.
You do as much as you can, fill in as many gaps as
possible until you crash and burn. Working as a writing instructor
was ideal because of the amount of free time that I
had. Time that, theoretically, I was supposed to be using
for my own writing. In reality, that time was spent being
preoccupied with how I was going to pay my bills.


I ended up taking another full-time position in addition
to, not in place of, my part-time teaching job. I also
founded a monthly reading series at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art. This was all within the first two
months of 1994. It was far more activity and responsibility
than I could handle. Illness, the next phase of the cycle,
took over.

[p. <i>[223]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00220&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Fitzgerald put me on 20 milligrams of Prozac—which
seemed to do the trick—and he also agreed to be my regular
therapist. I wasn't thrilled about having a male therapist,
but it was better than talking to someone with whom I was
not familiar. We talked a lot about my day-to-day problems,
but sometimes we also delved into my past and
touched on issues of abandonment, sexual abuse, and my
overall feelings of failure and worthlessness—all things, he
claimed (and I reluctantly agreed), fed into my depression.


Each week, sometimes twice a week, I went to Dr. Fitzgerald's
office. He was young, vibrant, kind; I liked him. It was
obvious from our sessions that he genuinely cared about me
and my progress, but the more I delved into my personal
history, I got the sense that Dr. Fitzgerald was having a hard
time understanding where I was coming from. This suspicion
was cemented when I told him about a racial incident
that occurred the day before a session. As far as racial incidents
go, it was a rather common one.


I had gone into a store to return a dress. The clerk followed
me as I walked throughout the store looking for another
dress to buy with the credit I assumed I would be given
for my return. Although she eyed me like a hawk, the clerk
never asked if I needed help. In line, I stood behind a
young white male also making a return, a gift that he wasn't
even sure was purchased from that store. After hearing how
kind and accommodating the cashier had been with him, I
was appalled by the rudeness and suspicion with which she
greeted me. She requested that I provide a receipt <i>and</i> personal
identification. She badgered me with questions: "Are

[p. <i>224</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00221&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Fitzgerald listened to my story. When I was through,
he pushed out a breath of relief. "Whew," he said. "It must
be so hard to be black. I can't even fathom having to contend
with what you must deal with on a daily basis." For
twenty minutes of my fifty-minute session, he talked about
how he, as a white man, had never experienced prejudice in
the same way that I probably had—as if I didn't already know
this—but that he did sympathize with the hurt that incident
must have caused me, blah, blah, blah.


I did not feel like Dr. Fitzgerald was patronizing me. In
fact, I was grateful for his honesty, problematic as it was. But
if he was having a difficult time understanding the overt issues
of my life—like racism—was there any way that he could
be grasping the subtle ones? Racism is definitely in the eye
of the beholder. White people have at hand the privilege of
choosing whether to see or not see the racism that takes
place around them. If Dr. Fitzgerald could not "fathom"
my reality as a black person, how would he be able to assess
or address the rage, the fear, and the host of other complex
emotions that go hand-in-hand with being black in a racist
society? For whatever reasons, seeing a black therapist had
never crossed my mind, until then.


I do not believe that white therapists are unable to successfully
treat people of color; however, I do think that they
should possess a certain level of cultural sensitivity, as that
culture plays an important role in both the patient's illness

[p. <i>[225]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00222&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

With Shelly, I was completely at ease presenting the
problems I faced trying to embrace two cultures and sort
out how that process has affected my familial relationships.
She did more than empathize with me; as a foreigner herself,
she knew firsthand of what I spoke. Discussing my past
sexual abuse and my inclination toward violent men was far
more comfortable with Shelly than with Dr. Fitzgerald. Before
we reached a place in our therapy sessions where race
was presented as an issue, Shelly left, so I am not certain
how or what I would have felt. There was much that I wanted
to know about Dr. Fitzgerald but, because of what he kept
insisting were professional confines, was not able to find
out.


The point at which I became aware of Dr. Fitzgerald's
possible limitations was when I followed Eugene's advice
and took control of my own healing. Eugene was right; it is
wise to be specific and certain about what it is that you wish
to gain from therapy. Despite the reservations I had about
Dr. Fitzgerald, I did not stop seeing him. Finding a new
caregiver would have disrupted the strides I was making. Finally,
I was releasing things that had been bottled up for

[p. <i>226</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00223&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It did not make that much of a difference to me if Dr.
Fitzgerald was listening or not, if he cared or not, if he understood
or not. <i>I</i> was listening, <i>I</i> was hearing, <i>I</i> was understanding.
<i>I</i> cared. When the time came that I wanted more
from a therapist than what Dr. Fitzgerald could offer, I
would know enough to act accordingly.


In MARCH, JADE came to Los Angeles to visit her cousin,
Aaron. She called me and asked if I could spend the day with
her. We hadn't spoken since the time I called her at the hospital.
I knew that she was doing remarkably well. She had
been discharged after a two-week stay. Paula, whom I spoke
with frequently, kept me up to date on Jade's progress. The
two of them had become good friends.


I picked Jade up in the late morning and we drove toward
the beach, with the windows rolled down, savoring the California
sun. We were planning on going to Venice Beach for
sushi and a stroll along the boardwalk. There were a number
of things that each of us wanted to bring the other up to
speed on. We made a pact to not get into the topic of depression
until much later in the day, after our outing. We
both just wanted to get away, laugh, and forget for a while
that our lives are often fogged with despair.

[p. <i>[227]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00224&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We used surface roads to get to Venice Beach because the
freeway had collapsed during the earthquake a couple of
months back. It was a long ride from Silverlake, where
Aaron stayed, to Venice. I made it even lengthier by taking
the scenic route so that Jade and I could sightsee. She
popped a cassette of Sade's <i>Love Deluxe</i> into the player. Our
singing was interspersed with jokes and random commentaries
about the people and houses that we drove by. When
the song "Like a Tattoo" came on, Jade turned the volume
up.


"Listen," she said. "Listen to these words."


I stopped talking and took in the lyrics. Jade turned the
volume a notch higher and shook her head to the rhythm,
"Right here." Still holding the knob, she sang along forcefully
with a line, "<i>he spoke of his dreams broken by the burden of his
youth/ fourteen years, he said/ I couldn't look into the sun</i>"; then she
turned to me and said, "You know, I feel the same way. Like
my dreams were broken by the burden of my youth, my depression.
I don't even know if I dream anymore. I just try to
not be depressed."


We never made it to the boardwalk. We sat in the restaurant
for hours talking about the very topic we were trying to
avoid, depression. She described what it was like to be in a
mental institution. Therapy everyday, several times a day;
tests; observations; medication; isolation.


"They took the book that I was reading away from me,"
she complained.


"Why?" I demanded.

[p. <i>228</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00225&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"My doctor didn't think it was a suitable piece of literature
for ‘someone like me’."


"What?" I asked in indignant wonder. "What was that all
about? I would think they would have wanted you to read.
Reading is supposed to be therapeutic. It's supposed to—"
And then I remembered who I was talking to. Knowing
Jade, it probably was an inappropriate book. "What were
you reading?"


"<i>The Bell Jar</i>," she said deviously. We both laughed. Only
Jade would take a Sylvia Plath book with her to the psych
ward. While she was there, Jade overcame her suicidal
ideation and found a reason to fight. During one of her
many physical examinations, she had seen her heart on an
echocardiogram.


"I was one of the youngest patients there," she explained.
"I guess the doctors were used to seeing old, battered organs.
When the projection of my heart came up on the
screen, one doctor told his assistant, ‘Look at that. It's
beautiful. It's perfect.’ So I looked, too, and there was my
heart. We always talk about our hearts, but how often do we
get a chance to see them? All I could think of was the blood
that was passing through it. The veins, the arteries, the vessels.
That was what was keeping me alive; my heart. The doctor
saw so much beauty and perfection in it, I thought that
maybe if I stayed alive, I would eventually see it, too."


"This from a person who claims to not have dreams?" I
teased. "I may not be able to see your heart, but I can sure see
your face, and it's telling me that you are full of dreams."


"Maybe. I do have the same dreams I have always had. I

[p. <i>[229]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00226&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The conversation that Jade and I had about dreams stayed
on my mind for weeks. I thought about the real dreams that
I had been having throughout the course of my battles with
depression. Be it in flames or in water, I was always drowning
in my dreams, being swallowed, being smothered by
forces of nature while the people standing nearby watched
as I suffered and struggled to stay alive. I wasn't sure what
that meant. I got to wondering about my other dreams, the
aspirations in my soul, not in my head. There were two,
both of which involved the process of creation.


My strongest yearning was to build a career as a writer.
The articles, the poems, and the stories that I had written
were a start, but for twelve years I had been starting and
never quite making it anywhere. In the beginning, when I
was younger, being a writer was a conceivable ambition;
there was little doubt in my mind that I would make my living
that way. The scales shifted somewhere along the line
and the doubts began to outweigh the desire.


Korama ruled the other aspiration. Like the fiercest of
poems, she was conceived when I least expected or appreciated
the power that her presence would hold. I didn't know
I had it in me to deliver something so beautiful to the
world. But she was not a poem; she was a novel, a narrative
that was unfolding day by day, page by page. As the person
who was chosen to facilitate her development, I wanted to
learn how to trust my instincts; I wanted to know when to

[p. <i>230</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00227&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Like Jade, I felt that my dreams had gotten trapped under
the stress of depression. They were definitely chipped and
fractured in spots, but they were not broken. Even if they
were, I believed that as long as I was alive, the damage was
not irreparable. So I decided to go about the business of
making them come true. That was all there was to it. That
was the day, the first time ever in my life, that I made a commitment
to being alive. Not the first time that I said that I
wanted to live, or dreamed about living; it was the first time
that I made a <i>commitment</i>, that I gave myself my word.


There was no master plan, no bolt of lightning from the
sky, no cryptic calling. I was sick and tired of waiting for
miracles, waiting for approval, waiting for happiness. For
years I had been waiting, asking over and over and over and
over, "Why me?" and I never found the answer so I figured
what the hell, and decided to try asking, "Why not me?"


The pressure of working two jobs and wearing so many hats
finally took its toll. I was becoming less and less productive
at everything I was doing. There never seemed to be enough
hours in the day. I was tired of constantly feeling like I was
behind the eight-ball. Because of the change in my sleeping
habits, I thought for sure that an episode of depression was
on the horizon. I quit my day job. When I slowed my pace, I
saw that it was not depression after all, just plain, old exhaustion,
from having spread myself too thin.

[p. <i>[231]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00228&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One less job meant one less paycheck so I had to cut back
on my spending. I made a list of my expenditures and, after
careful deliberation, selected therapy as one of the things I
could do without for a while. I was nearly twenty-seven years
old. Every major detail of my life had been placed on the
table. All the cards were face up. It had all been said, and re-said.
And said again. I was sick of talking about the past.
Moreover, it seemed self-defeating to spend the next twenty-seven
years of my life hanging on to the pain of the first
twenty-seven. Dr. Fitzgerald thought I was being drastic.


"For someone who wanted to take their time learning
how to walk, you're being a tad hasty about getting out there
and trying to fly, don't you think?"


I recognized his concern. I had heard those words, or
some variation of them, a thousand times. Ordinarily, I
would have gotten defensive. I would have tried to get him
to agree, or at least see, that I was right and he was wrong,
but I wasn't feeling it that day. I didn't care if he was right.


Ending that particular round of therapy turned out to be
a wise decision. It afforded me the opportunity to shift my
consciousness, and the distance to digest everything that I
had taken in. It was not, by any stretch of the imagination,
my last encounter with psychotherapy. When I was ready, I
began a new relationship with a new therapist, and worked
with her until I felt that I had gone as far as I could go in her
care. It has been refreshing and, ultimately, transformative
to work with different people. Though I have not yet found
a therapist whom I feel is 100% "right" for me, each one
that I have worked with—there have been six in total—has

[p. <i>232</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00229&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I SCHEDULED A trip to D.C. to visit with family and
friends. In the back of my mind, I was also hoping to drum
up some more writing assignments. In the last hour of the
flight, I had a massive fit of anxiety. Korama and I were
going to be staying with my mother. After spending so much
time talking about her in therapy, I was terrified to lay eyes
on her. I figured that she was going to give me grief about
my dreads, which she never failed to inform me were not
very Ghanaian.


Korama and I took the Metro from the airport. Mum
picked us up from the subway station. I put Korama in the
back and strapped her into the carseat that Mum kept for
our visits. I offered my mother a weak smile as I slid into the
passenger seat and then turned my eyes and my entire upper
body toward the window.


"Nana-Ama, let me look at your face," she requested. I
took a deep breath, turned my head in her direction, and
waited to hear what she had to say. "Look at your hair. It
makes you look like, like, like, you know."


"I don't know what you're talking about," I said coldly. I
turned my head back toward the window and she started
driving.


"You know you were really plump when you were a baby,"
she continued. It figures, I thought to myself, she's telling

[p. <i>[233]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00230&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was actually a very sweet thing for her to say because I
knew that she had initially hated the idea of me locking my
hair, but I was too upset from the anticipation of negativity.


"Oh," I muttered, keeping my eyes fixed on the window.
When we entered The Ivy, Jade and Paula were sitting on
the stoop, waiting for us. I jumped out of the car before my
mother could place the gear in park, leaving her to tend to
Korama, without so little as a thank you for the ride.


The next day while Paula was at school and Mum was at
work, I started cleaning up the toys that Korama had left
lying around the living room. At the far end of the couch, I
could see the toes of a baby-doll leg sticking out from one
of the corners. As I got on all fours to pull it out, I discovered
a photo album. I pulled both the doll and the album
out from under the couch, then sat down to look at what I
thought would be old family photos.


Inside the album was every article that had ever been
written about me, every performance program from the
shows I had produced, flyers from poetry readings I forgot I
had even participated in. It was a record of my entire career
as an artist. I was blown away. All along while I was sending
my mother reviews, articles, poems, trying to get some

[p. <i>234</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00231&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I can do it early next week," he offered.


I was only in town through that Monday. Monica, Jade's
sister, had offered to babysit for me on Friday so that I could
run errands. My flight was leaving in the early evening on
Monday and I wasn't sure if I could squeeze in a trip to the city
and make it back to The Ivy in time. And even if I could, I didn't
know if Monica or Jade would be able to watch Korama.


"I'm leaving on Monday," I told him. "But I wanted to
know if I could run an article idea by you."


"Sure," he responded. "We can always use something
good. What do you have in mind?"


I couldn't think of any of the query ideas I had come up
with while I was still in L.A. I tossed the first idea that
popped into my head, something about the black church
and homosexuality. He asked me what my angle was and, of
course, I didn't have one.


"Think of one," he advised. "And call me back. By the way,
what've you been up to? I haven't heard from you in a while."


"You don't even want to know," I laughed. In what ended
up being an extremely long-winded anecdote, I told him all
about my bouts with depression, the Zoloft, the drinking,
the therapy, the Prozac. Just like in the conversation we had
about my job as a phone sex operator, the more questions
he asked, the more I revealed.

[p. <i>[235]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00232&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"There's your story right there," he said.


"Not a chance in hell," I responded.


"That's the same thing you said about the phone sex
piece and look how popular that was. There's a whole lot of
stuff being written about depression these days. Have you
read William Styron's book? If you were to write a piece,
you'd have to make sure that you weren't repeating what's
already been said, which will be pretty hard to do."


"Yeah, right," I said sarcastically. "Like Styron and I
would ever have the same angle on anything. We had the
same illness; the similarities end there. The way I did depression
was a-whole-nother bag of beans. I'm a single
black mother about a half a paycheck away from the government
cheese line."


"There you have it," he said, as if he'd struck gold. "Make
it about two thousand words, no more than twenty-five
hundred. You can keep it personal, but you've gotta hook
into what's going on out there. Remember to push the
transcendence key. I've gotta run to a meeting. Call me if
you get stuck. Bye."


And then he hung up. I tried to call him back and tell
him that I didn't want to write the piece, but his voice mail
picked up, and I didn't leave a message.


When Paula got home from school, she and I sat down
and talked about her therapy. We also exchanged horror stories
about our experiences with Zoloft. She had stopped taking
the medication because she claimed that she didn't feel
"normal" under its influence. I asked her to define normal.


"I can't," she said. "But I know it doesn't come in a pill."

[p. <i>236</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00233&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Paula had also stopped going to therapy. The therapist
she was seeing moved on to private practice and Paula did
not want to continue her sessions with a new therapist.


"What are you going to do now?" I asked her.


"I don't know. What are you going to do?"


"I don't know," I said.


We were both at a crossroads. I had a feeling that she, like
I, did know what she was going to do to fill her chasms, but it
was not something that could be easily articulated. Paula is in
college now and, like most young adults, I suppose she is trying
to "find" herself. To the best of my knowledge, she never
resumed medication or went back into therapy. I don't know
why because she never told me. She does not volunteer
much, if any, information about herself. Asking feels too
much like prying, so I don't. Our relationship is evolving,
although right now, I can't tell exactly how, or into what.


After Paula and I had talked about therapy, I pulled out
the album I found earlier.


"What's this all about?" I asked, handing it to her. She
flipped through the first few pages.


"You've never seen it before?"


"No," I said. "It was under the couch."


"It must have fallen. It's normally there, next to the
lamp." She was pointing to the end table in the living room.
"Mommy shows it to everybody who comes over and she
brags about her daughter, the writer."


I stayed up most of the night thinking about whether or not
to write the article on depression. The word "suffering"

[p. <i>[237]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00234&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next morning, I called Mrs. Bledsoe and asked her if
I could drop by. She was warm and receptive. We made
plans to get together at her house the following day for tea
and a chat. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I think I was
searching for a mother figure. I wanted to talk to someone
who could help me find the words I had been searching for,
the ones I needed to bridge the gap between me and my own
mother.


WHILE MRS. BLEDSOE was in the kitchen preparing tea
for our visit, I wandered through the first floor of her
house, museum-style, with my hands clasped behind my
back, looking at the pictures, wood carvings, and assorted
curios. Her home was immaculate and magnificently decorated.
I was sure that there was a story behind each book,
painting, and quilt. Years worth of stories. Years worth of

[p. <i>238</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00235&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"That was taken in 1972," Mrs. Bledsoe said, looking
over my shoulder.


"It's beautiful," I said, tracing the edges of the frame with
my fingers. Mrs. Bledsoe acknowledged the compliment
with a quick smile as she put two cups of hot tea and a plate
of sandwiches down on the small, circular kitchen table.


"Eugene has told me a lot about you," I said, moving toward
the table and then sitting down.


"Oh he has, has he?" she replied, taking a seat. She didn't
sound upset or even curious. She had a pretty good idea
of what I was leading up to. I had already told her in our
phone conversation that I wanted to talk to her about depression.
Mentioning Eugene was simply a polite formality,
a way to ease into the subject.


"He told me about when you first started getting depressed,"
I proceeded, "and about how hard it was for you
to find out what was wrong with you."


"I'll tell you," she said, shaking her head, "that was something
else. I don't know if ‘hard’ is the right word. Eugene
was so young then. I still wonder how that affected him, not
having his mother around during that time. When I was
there, I wasn't really <i>there</i>."

[p. <i>[239]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00236&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She retreated into a pensive silence, the same kind she
was probably in when that photograph was taken. "How's
the baby?" she finally asked.


"Korama's fine," I answered. "She's three years old now.
Talking, walking, and being all grown."


"Take it in while you can," she advised. "It goes by fast.
Too fast."


I used the discussion of Korama to redirect the conversation
back to depression.


"I've always been a melancholy person," I told her. "But
after I had Korama, it just went to another level. It was one
episode of depression on top of another. I couldn't tell
where one ended and another one began. I don't know,
maybe something physical happened to me during the
pregnancy and childbirth. I developed toxemia while I was
carrying, but ... I don't know, maybe it wasn't that. Maybe
I was just overwhelmed by everything that happened in my
life after I had her."


"It's possible that your pregnancy triggered something,"
she said. "A month after I had Robert, my youngest, I had a
stroke. I don't know if Eugene mentioned it, but that's
when I first started going through these depressions."


When Eugene told me about his mother's battle with depression,
he had only given me a skeleton of facts about how
she found out she was depressed, how often her depression
came, and the various treatments she tried. Mrs. Bledsoe
fleshed out that skeleton by inserting the specifics—what,
when, where, and why. Most of our conversation about the
first eight years of her depression, I have already incorporated

[p. <i>240</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00237&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I was born in Georgia, in a small town right outside of Atlanta.
It was old and dusty and rural. I lived with my mother,
my father, and my younger brother. We had a regular family
life. But, when I was three years old, my mother ran away
with another man. He was an older man, a deacon at a Baptist
church—"


"Your mother just up and left you guys?" I asked in disbelief.


"Yep. She was young, about twenty-two years old. My father
was a couple of years older. She met this man, Ray, at a
regional conference of the Baptist Church Association.
After she disappeared with Ray, I didn't see her again for a
few years. They went to Atlanta, although we didn't find that
out until later. When Mom first left, none of us knew where
she was, not even my father."


I had heard plenty about fathers leaving their families,
but this was the first I'd ever heard about a mother doing
something like that. Somehow I'd always imagined, that
mothers were genetically programmed to be the nurturing
ones, the ones who stayed forever, despite whatever.


"Why did your mother do that?" I asked her.


"She was a flamboyant woman in her youth. I think she
must have felt trapped in that tiny town with her tiny family,
teaching at a tiny little country day school. All that smallness

[p. <i>[241]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00238&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What did your dad do after she left him?"


"We—my father, brother, and I— went to live with my
great-aunt, Mama Linda. Mama Linda took us in and
raised my brother and me for a few years. Back then, the
whole experience of having, and sometimes living with, an
extended family was rather common. We had a rich community
life and as a result, I wasn't all that lonely." I found
it hard to believe that she wasn't lonely, even with all that
family around. Nobody can replace a mother.


"You didn't miss your mother at all?"


"Yes. Sometimes. I was really young, four or five at the
time, but I clearly remember feeling the emotional depravation
of losing my mother. I remember sitting in the dirt
behind the old schoolhouse one day. My face was buried in
my knees and I was sobbing so hard I could feel the drops of
tears trickling down the sides of my legs. Charlie-Ann
Hackenberry, this girl that lived down the way, came up and
asked me why I was crying. ‘I miss my mother,’ I told her, ‘I
miss her so much.’


"And then, shortly after that day, an uncle of mine who
lived in Atlanta spotted my mother."


"Did she come back home to you guys?" I asked, my heart
aching for the motherless child that Mrs. Bledsoe once was.


"No. I can't recall how long a period of time it was from
when he saw her until we heard from her again, but she did
slowly start to reestablish contact. She sent me care packages.

"Were she and that man still together?"


"Yes. She eventually left him, but I don't know why. Mom
had a lot of husbands and boyfriends. She was married five
times, every other year it seemed like. It got to be a little embarrassing
because each time she got remarried, we had a
new last name. I hated my mother."


"Well," I shrugged, "it seems only natural to dislike your
mother after what she did to you."


"No, Meri. I mean I really hated her, until well after I was
a mother myself. Running out on us was only the beginning.
She was extremely unpleasant to me, and that's
putting it mildly. The truth is that she was downright mean.
I don't remember ever being hugged or kissed by her
throughout my entire childhood. She never let me have
company or talk on the phone. That made living at home
feel like being in prison because I had no one to spend time
with."


Imagining Mrs. Bledsoe growing up with such cruelty
brought tears to my eyes. She started to cry, too.


"She neglected my needs to fulfill her own. She was really
pretty, like the fashion models in the magazines, and she
dressed real well. All the new clothes that she bought were
for her. She hardly ever bought me anything new or nice to
wear. I don't want to give you the impression that I was wearing

"Did you have any friends?" I asked.


"Oh, lots. I did well in school. I guess you could say that I
was popular. When I was in the twelfth grade, I was a drum
major, one of those girls that marches in front of the band
during parades. I was dating the captain of the football
team. He was a handsome fellow, but when it came down to
it, we didn't have very much in common. He and I got married
when I was seventeen because I was pregnant with my
daughter, Laura. I was pregnant when I started college, and
Laura was born in January of 1949, midway through my
first year. While she was still an infant, I left her father because
he was physically abusive. Laura and I went to live with
Mama Linda. By the time I was nineteen, I was divorced.
Luckily, I was able to re-enroll in college. That's where I
met Gilbert, my present husband.


"Gilbert's sister, who was my friend, went to the same
college. Gilbert and I started dating, but then he was
drafted during the Korean War. While he was away, I moved
to Lansing. After he returned, he finished college and
moved up to Detroit, Michigan, to live with his uncle and
look for work. We started dating again. He got a job in
Lansing and then, a year later, in 1955, he and were married.
Eugene was born in 1958. Right about then, my
mother was living in Louisville, Kentucky. After the children
were born, she tried to be kind to me, but I wouldn't

"Just up to the time when Dr. Thorpe put you on the
Elavil and started giving you outpatient shock treatments.
But, obviously, your episodes of depression didn't stop for
good."


"That treatment worked for about four or five years. I
wasn't in psychotherapy then. I was just taking the medicine
and getting the shock treatments. I suppose the Elavil served
its purpose, but the shock treatments were more effective."


"When did you start seeing a therapist?"


"In 1969, we moved to Washington, D.C. I was depressed
that entire year. It was the first time I had been depressed
through the spring and summer as well. I started seeing this
psychotherapist, Frank Priggam, who didn't buy into this
whole business of medication and shock therapy. But seeing
him was helpful. He brought me to my first level of understanding
about my mother."


"Were you and your mother still in contact?"


"Every few months, Gil and I would take the kids to Lansing
to see her. Just knowing that I would have to hug her, to
touch her, made me sick to my stomach. And as great as Dr.
Priggam was, the depression persisted and eventually became

I interrupted Mrs. Bledsoe.


"How does shock treatment feel? This probably sounds
stupid, but does it hurt?"


"The doctors give you this anesthesia, it's like a muscle
relaxant. You can feel it flowing through your body. It starts
from the tip of your toes and then tingles its way up through
the rest of you. By the time it hits your midsection, you are
completely under, or at least, you should be.


"Something went wrong with my last treatment. The
doctors were to be administering treatment to both sides of
my brain. I was not fully asleep when the electricity passed
through me. It wasn't pain that I felt. It was definitely
shock, like sticking not just one, but all ten of your fingers
into an electrical socket. That was the worst possible feeling
to live through. You'd better believe it was the last time I received
shock therapy. I'll be the first to admit that, for me,
it works better than anything else, but I'd rather go without
it than risk feeling what I felt ever again, even if the possibility
is remote.


"I stayed in the hospital for several weeks. After I was released,
I went back into therapy with Dr. Priggam. He and I
worked together until he retired the next year. After Dr.
Priggam, I had therapy with a black woman psychiatrist, Dr.
Myrtle Summit, for six years. We worked on my relationship
with my mother and I was finally able to make peace
with her. I actually learned to love her. I learned to hold her
before she died. About seven or eight years before she

[p. <i>246</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048385-I00243&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"She didn't know any better?" I repeated sarcastically.
Just hearing about the pain Mrs. Bledsoe had been through
made me feel very protective of her.


"Had I not had children myself, it would have been difficult
for me to understand how someone could not have
known any better than to be so emotionally cruel to her own
child. Having been a young mother myself, I understand
what she meant by that. You grow to know life's complexities.
Good, bad, or indifferent, all mothers leave their children
with a lot to be desired. That's because we're all
tackling life at the same time that we're trying to raise and do
right by our children. I realized that my mother was a young
woman. She was still trying to get hers from the world. I
eventually wrote her back and told her that I had forgiven
her, that I did understand and that I did love her, very
much. In fact, I was right by her side when she died."


This made me think about Korama. As she got older, what
would her thoughts be on my mothering? Would this illness
block her vision of my attempts to do right by her? Would
she see it as an illness, or assume it was just part of my character,
and allow it to negatively define our relationship? I

"Do you still see a therapist?" I asked Mrs. Bledsoe.


"No," she replied. "As far as I'm concerned, there comes
a point where therapy is no longer useful. I felt very healthy
emotionally. All the quote-unquote problem areas of my
life had been worked out and every winter, I still got depressed.
There are all sorts of reasons why people get depressed
and stay depressed. But depression, in its most
basic, clinical form, is biochemical. It is an illness. Some
people get through it and it never returns. For thirty-seven
years, my depression has returned nearly every winter. I
have reconciled myself with the fact that I am going to have
to deal with this for the rest of my life.


"In my case, I feel that medication is the only thing that will
work. Right now I see a psychopharmacologist who is based at
the National Institutes of Mental Health. I go to him and we
try out different drugs. It's a process of trial and error. Some
of the medications I have taken are fine one year and then
cease to be effective the next, and then the depression returns.
Right now I am taking a drug called Pamelor. It worked
very well through this last cycle of depression. I'm just hoping
that come September, it'll still be working."


Before leaving, I took one last look at that photograph, the
one of just her. There was a haunting feeling to it. I silently
guessed that she was going through a depression when the
picture was taken. It was not so much the look that she had

"It's funny," she said, reading my mind. "People who
know, can tell immediately. My daughter, Laura, can always
tell. She can hear it in my voice, even when I am trying to
disguise it. The instant she saw that photograph, she said,
‘Mom, you were depressed then.’"


"Thank God that Korama's too young to know," I said.


"She's too young to tell you," Mrs. Bledsoe corrected.
"But she's not too young to know."
