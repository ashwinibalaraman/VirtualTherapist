<font size="4"><b>Vicarious Extinction</b></font>

Vicarious extinction is a form of modeling in which
a previously reinforced behavior is eliminated by
withdrawal of consequences applied to a model. It is
generally used within a therapeutic context as a method
of reducing anxiety or fear but can also be used to
eliminate other unwanted emotions or behaviors.
Extinction refers to the elimination of all response-maintaining
reinforcers; after these reinforcers are
eliminated, so is the undesired response. Vicarious
extinction involves the individual observing another
person performing the behavior without incurring the
maintaining consequences.


For example, "Ryan" is an 8-year-old boy who is
afraid of dogs. To eliminate this fear, Ryan's therapist
has him view other children playing with a dog. The
interaction has no adverse consequences. Furthermore,
the positive consequences (i.e., immediate fear
reduction) associated with avoidance do not occur.
After witnessing the absence of aversive consequences,
Ryan's fear is diminished, and he is able to
approach a dog. Vicarious extinction has just taken
place. Studies have also shown that increasing the
diversity of stimuli decreases fear. For example, Ryan
would be more likely to experience a reduction in
anxiety after seeing several models interacting with
several different dogs, rather than observing one model
interacting with one dog.

The observation of a model is central to vicarious
extinction. Modeling is part of social learning theory,
which holds that learning, or changes in behavior, can
come about through observation. In vicarious extinction,
individuals learn through observing models that
engaging in a behavior does not necessarily lead to the
expected outcomes.


Although it is used in therapy, vicarious extinction
can occur in everyday life as well. Simply by observing
others interacting without fear and without the anticipated
consequences, an anxious person's own fear can
be reduced. Studies have shown that children with phobias
who observe peers interacting with their feared
stimuliwithout incurring negative consequencesdemonstrate
stable and generalized avoidance reduction.
This can be accomplished with a wide range of
fears, from specific phobias to social avoidance.


Vicarious extinction can be accomplished through a
variety of means. For instance, live or symbolic models
can be used. That is, models can be observed directly
(live) or can be observed on tape (symbolic). Whether
the model is symbolic or live does not appear to affect
treatment outcome. Symbolic modeling is sometimes
preferred, as it allows an additional degree of control
over the feared situation. Taped interactions can be carefully
screened for the presence of unintended consequences,
while live modeling involves a small degree of
risk, as consequences are occasionally unpredictable.


Additional types of modeling in vicarious extinction
for the treatment of anxiety involve the presence
or the absence of fear. A mastery model displays no
fear at all and engages in the behavior competently
and calmly. Conversely, a coping model displays initial
fearfulness but gradually becomes less fearful and
more competent as the behavior is performed.
