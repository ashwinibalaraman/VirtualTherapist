- <b>STRESS AND PSYCHOSOMATIC
HEALTH</b>


For more than 300 years, Western culture has
subscribed to a mechanistic model of health
based on the philosophy of Ren√© Descartes
(1596-1650) that the mind and body are separate
and on the laws of physics created by Sir
Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and inspired by
the work of Descartes. This mechanistic paradigm
(also called the "reductionist" model)
compares the universe and all its components
to a large mechanical clock in which everything
operates in a sequential and predictable
form. Influenced by Newtonian physics, the
field of medicine applied this mechanistic
model to the human organism. This era of
medicine focused on signs and symptoms of
dysfunction, and physicians were taught to
"fix" or repair the parts that were not operating
properly, primarily through medications
and surgery.


In the mechanistic world of medicine, the
responsibility for recovery was removed almost
completely from the patient and placed
with the physician. This model failed to include.
the multiple dimensions of the human
organism that contributed to both the development
of the disease and the healing process
(Seaward, 1997). These dimensions of mind,
emotion, and spirit became "connected" to the
body with the evolution of concepts such as
stress and psychosomatic illness.


It has been estimated that as many as 70%
to 80% of all patient visits to internists and
family practice physicians are made by individuals
with psychophysiologic conditions
(Corbin, Hanson, Happ, &amp; Whitby, 1988).
Historically, the term <i>psychosomatic</i> was used
to describe physical health problems that were
the consequence of excessive emotional
arousal, maladaptive coping, and chronic
stress. The premise of psychosomatic illness
is that the mind and emotions play important
roles in the origins or progression of disease
or both. All such illnesses affect the function
and structure of the human body in some way
as well. The term was first introduced in 1927
by Felix Deutsch, and the first major publication
on the topic was by Helen Dunbar in
1935.


Dubos (1965) noted that even infectious
organic diseases did not necessarily occur just
because pathogenic (disease-causing) microbes

[p. <i>144</i>]

Although the term psychosomatic illness
has been widely used by a variety of disciplines,
the underlying assumption of linear relationships
between behavioral and physiological
processes is contradicted by the
unitary conception of health espoused by
nursing (Newman, 1994; Parse, 1992; Rogers,
1970). All health events and states are more
accurately a reflection of the undivided multidimensional
wholeness of the individual. Every
aspect of one's health and being interacts
with all others as a unitary pattern. Nonetheless,
there are important interactions between
stressors of various kinds and the development
and progression of certain health conditions.


Stress-related illnesses range from the
common cold to cancer. Clearly, psychological
states involve physiological functions that
cannot be separated from each other. Both
must be addressed by the health professions,
including nursing, when attempting to resolve
patients' complaints. Health care professionals,
especially nurses, who tend to have more
consistent contact with patients with psychosomatic
conditions, must use a holistic approach.
Clients need care that addresses their
physical, psychological, cognitive, emotional,
spiritual, and social concerns; anything less is
only partial care.


In this chapter, we discuss theory and research
that support the psychophysiological
basis for specific health conditions and the
more common psychophysiological (psychosomatic)
problems that health care providers
encounter. These conditions include heart disease,
hypertension, cancer, migraines, temporomandibular
joint disorder (TMJ), adultonset
allergic reactions, pain, and somatoform
disorders. The latter, which have a stronger
psychological basis, include body dysmorphic
disorder, conversion disorder, hypochondriasis,
somatization disorder, pain disorder,
undifferentiated somatoform disorder,
and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified.
Each of the previously mentioned health
states, whether physical or psychological in
origin, will be examined in terms of its epidemiology,
etiology, and contributing psychophysiological
factors. Research, measurement,
and nursing intervention and treatment
will also be discussed.


- <b>STRESS PATHWAYS</b>


<b><i>Physiology of Stress</i></b>


To understand the relationship of stress to
development of illness, it is necessary for the
reader to have a thorough understanding of
the physiology of stress. This includes an understanding
of the sensory input into the
brain, the role of the sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous systems, and the effects
of neurochemical mediators (cortisol and
catecholamines) and their role in mediating
the stress response. It is also important to understand
the roles of vasopressin and thyroxine
and the role of the immune system in the
development of possible illnesses. All of these
are discussed in other chapters in this book, or
the reader may wish to consult a physiology
text such as Guyton's (1996) for a more indepth
review.


There is also a large body of research that
discusses the mediating or buffering effects of
social connections on the physiological stress
response. These mediating factors include social
and family relationships, the effects of social
isolation and friendships, and the stress
response. These are also addressed in other
chapters in this book.


In summary, neuroendocrine levels and
social context are affirmed by research as significant
elements in mediating the physiological

[p. <i>145</i>]

- <b>PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL
MODELS OF STRESS</b>


There have been several research efforts to
explain the relationship between stress and
disease. Although there is currently not
enough scientific information to create a substantiated
stress and disease model, there are
theoretical frameworks that are useful in attempting
to understand portions of these very
complex interrelationships. Some of the most
prominent theories are the Borysenko Model,
Pelletier's Premodel, and the Allostatic Load
Model as frameworks for the health impact of
stress.


Borysenko (1987, 1991) speculates that
when the immune system is functioning normally,
it is precisely regulated. When it is not
in homeostasis, the result can be overcorrection
or underreaction of the immune function
or perhaps both. Disease can occur in either
case. The causes of overreactions can be
exogenous (e.g., allergic reaction to a foreign
substance) or endogenous (e.g., lymphocytes
attack and destroy healthy tissue, resulting in
diseases such as arthritis or lupus). Borysenko
suggests that an abundance of stress hormones
produced by exaggerated autonomic
responses can result in migraines, ulcers, hypertension,
irritable bowel syndrome, coronary
heart disease, and asthma. When an exogenous
underreaction occurs, foreign
substances undermine the ability of the B cells
to prevent infection, resulting in, for example,
colds, flu infections, or herpes. In endogenous
underreactions, antigens are not attacked by T
cells and may develop in neoplasms (cancerous
tumors).


Borysenko (1987, 1991) suggests that
psychological stress can disrupt the precise
homeostasis of the immune system. Stress is
the catalyst that causes the over- or
underreaction that leads to harmful physiological
effects. A relaxation intervention or regular
use of a technique such as meditation or
mental imagery may counteract the effects of
stress, returning the immune system to its
homeostatic balance. The connection between
the mind's ability to perceive a situation as
stressful and the resulting changes in the immune
system has not been identified as clearly
as have the other aspects of the body's response
to stress.


In discussing the Pelletier Premodel,
Pelletier and Herzing (1988) noted that controlled
studies have not demonstrated that
positive emotions can enhance immune function.
They thought that parapsychology and
metaphysics needed to be examined more
carefully when developing a stress-disease
model. Areas to be considered in this arena include
multiple personality disorder (MPD),
spontaneous remissions, hypnosis, placebos,
subtle energy, and immunity enhancement.
Often, persons with MPD have different personalities
with different diseases or with no
disease. In most cases, the person has experienced
a major traumatic event as a child.
Stress is strongly associated with the etiology
of the disease, but its disappearance and reappearance
with various personalities is confusing.
Even more confusing is the sudden disappearance
of a diagnosed illness. Often, these
persons were thought to be terminally ill.
Most have been cancer sufferers, but it has
been documented in other diseases as well, including
HIV. Such cases are often ignored because
they are anecdotal and cannot be duplicated
in controlled studies. When the
unconscious mind is accessed via hypnosis,
physiological changes are observed that are
also often difficult to understand. Biochemical
changes partly responsible for healing
have occurred under hypnosis. Diseases that
have been "cured" when a person undergoes
hypnosis include asthma, hay fever, and contact
dermatitis. Adrenocorticotropic hormone

[p. <i>146</i>]

Pelletier and Herzing (1988) support the
use of magnetic resonance imaging, which is
based on the concept of subtle energy, for
clinical diagnosis of health and illness. They
also suggest that researchers in psychoneuroimmunology
examine the relationship between
the principles of physics and health.
Pelletier suggests that immunoenhancement
should be examined in relation to the use of
mental imagery, meditation, and cognitive restructuring
to enhance the immune system to
create an environment that is conducive to
spontaneous remission and other aspects of
healing. If the immune system can be suppressed
through conscious thought, the result
of growth of tumors and other diseases, then it
should be possible to enhance the immune
system.


The Allostatic Load framework was developed
by McEwen and Stellar (1993) (Figure
7.1). They proposed the concept as a
framework for understanding the long-term
effects of physiologic responses to stress.
Allostasis, as previously defined by Sterling
and Eyer (1988), is the ability to achieve stability
(or balance) in response to stress.
Allostatic load is the "wear and tear" resulting
from chronic neural and neuroendocrine activity
with repeated exposure to stress. An
allostatic load is imposed by recurrent activation
of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
and the HPA axis, laying a physiological
foundation for disease. Within this framework,
it is not only important to one's health
that responses to stress occur in a timely fashion
but also that they are inactivated when
they are no longer needed.


Individual interpretations, social context,
genetic makeup, stage of development, gender,
past learning and social history, and perception
of threat are all incorporated into
McEwen and Stellar's (1993) Allostatic Load
Model. When one perceives a situation, such
as taking a final examination, as stressful,
catecholamines are released from sympathetic
nerve endings and from the adrenal medulla.
Cortisol is released from the adrenal cortex at
the same time, providing energy and increased
blood flow to deal with the anticipated crisis.
When the stressful circumstance no longer exists
(e.g., one completes‚Äîand, it is hoped,
passes‚Äîthe exam), the stress response is normally
inactivated, allowing for a return to
baseline levels of catecholamines and cortisol.
If inactivation does not occur or is incomplete,
one's organs are exposed to continued excessive
amounts of these neuromediators.


McEwen (1998) cited the following circumstances
in which allostatic load may predispose
an individual to pathology and illness:
(a) frequent exposure to stressful stimuli, (b)
lack of adaptation (or habituation) to a stressful
situation that occurs repeatedly (Kirschbaum,
Prussner, &amp; Stone, 1995), (c) failure to
terminate allostatic responses when the
stressor is removed (Lowy, Wittenberg, &amp;
Yamamoto, 1995), and (d) excessive levels of
one element due to lack of another (e.g., secretion
of excessive inflammatory cytokines
due to inadequate cortisol secretion) (Munck,
&Guyre;, 1991).


Virtually any source of physical or emotional
stress can impose an allostatic load, depending
largely on its chronicity. McEwen
and Stellar (1993) cited alcohol consumption
as an example of the linkage between behavioral
processes and allostatic load. Alcohol
may be used initially as a way to cope with
stress (Sher, 1987), but new stressors are introduced
by the use and abuse of alcohol, including
negative reactions of family and
friends, feelings of guilt and anxiety, and adverse
physical health reactions (Kushner,
Shen, &amp; Beltman, 1990). Drinking behaviors
then increase as a way to cope with the escalating
stress, and allostatic load continues to
increase in cyclical fashion.


Investigators in the MacArthur Studies of
Successful Aging (McEwen, Albeck, &amp;
Cameron, 1995; Seeman, McEwen, Singer,
Albert, &amp; Rowe, 1997) quantified allostatic
load through urinary cortisol measurement
and discovered that subjects with lower
allostatic load scores had higher levels of
physical and mental functioning. These subjects
also had a lower incidence of cardiovascular

Allostatic load. Conceptual model of biology and behavior in which responses that are stressful result from the
interpretation of, and behavioral and physiologic responses to, environmental challenges that may be stressful to some
individuals and less or not stressful to others. (A) Physical and psychologic challenges operate within social context that
includes individual social status. The processing of this information by the nervous system is biased by factors such as
genetic predisposition that are operated on by developmental history, learning, and socioeconomic status; developmental age
and gender are also important factors. Interpretation of a stimulus as threatening results in behavioral responses that vary in
degree and cost to the individual and that are therefore stressful to varying degrees. Nonthreatening situations and low-cost
responses are not considered stressful because they do not elevate physiologic responses. Stress refers to responses that are
costly in terms of arousal of physiologic systems and elicitation of behaviors that are harmful. Thwarted responses may lead
to aggression or result in helplessness that is similar to a response being unavailable. High-cost responses, which may
include aggression, are ones that consume energy and that further increase risk to additionally challenge. All these
responses, including vigilance and helplessness, have biological counterparts, and they feed back to influence additional
stimulation and processing of that stimulation. (B) Behavioral responses are accompanied by neural and neuroendocrine
responses that act on effectors, such as the immune and cardiovascular systems and adipose tissue and muscle. Chronic or
repeated stimulation of these effectors may be due to thwarted or high-cost responses or to anxiety associated with vigilance
or helplessness and may lead to allostatic load that, over time, increases risk for pathology and disease. Acute stress more
readily precipitates disease when chronic stress has laid a pathophysiologic foundation (McEwen &amp; Stellar, 1993).
</div>
[p. <i>148</i>]

McEwen and Stellar (1993) suggest that
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) provides
an example of increased allostatic load.
Persons with PTSD are hypervigilant and often
angry and hostile (McFall, Murburg,
Ko, &amp; Veith, 1990). They have elevated catecholamine:cortisol
ratios (Yehuda, Giller,
Southwick, &amp; Lowy, 1991), indicating the
dominance of increased SNS activity. Hypervigilance
may be both cause and result of increased
SNS activity (McFall et al., 1990).


The allostatic model proposed by
McEwen and colleagues offers a useful interactive.
and multidimensional framework for
studying the relationships among physiological
stress responses and the development of
disease. Its primary limitation is in the recursive
nature of the model, which does not allow
for ongoing mutual interaction among the various
elements. Although logically and empirically
adequate, none of the models presented
takes into account social factors and unique
appraisals that are part of the whole of one's
experience of stress. Perceptions of social status,
connectedness, and support clearly influence
the physiological effects of chronic
stress, particularly with respect to health conditions
such as hypertension, coronary artery
disease, and immune function. Although these
models may contribute to the further development
of nursing frameworks, they are not by
themselves adequate for nursing's holistic
view of the human health experience.


Additional research needs to be conducted
that addresses the immunological responses
and the healing power of the mind.
The roles of beliefs, positive emotions, and
spiritual values should be incorporated into
research related to stress, health, and illness.
These spiritual aspects have largely been ignored
by clinical medicine. There have been
enough documented cases, however, so it is important
to include these topics in future studies.
Research should include the whole system
approach to understand the stress-disease/
mind-body phenomenon. Until a more complete
model is available to examine the relationship
between stress and disease, however,
researchers must work with the models available.
What is known about the current medical
model is that physical symptoms do occur
from stress and attack the health of specific regions
of the body (Seaward, 1997).


It is also known that personal characteristics
of the individual (age, gender, socioeconomic
status, occupation, education, and fitness)
all interact to either decrease or increase
the person's response to stressful stimuli. Behaviors
of the individual (smoking, alcohol
and drug use and abuse, eating habits, and exercise)
also influence the stress response either
positively or negatively. Mediating factors
such as coping ability, social support,
economic resources, and types of relationships
(conflict and supportive) either diminish
or attenuate the person's responsiveness. The
patients ability to cope, their spiritual resources,
and "people" resources, such as family
and friends, modify reactivity. Conflict and
abusive relationships intensify reactivity
(Thomas &amp; Wimbush, 1999). Figure 7.2 provides
an overview of the mediating factors of
stress and illness.


- <b>TARGET ORGANS AND
THEIR DISORDERS</b>


Psychosomatic illness can result from either
an overresponsive autonomic nervous system
or a suppressed immune system. It is important
to understand how these physiological
systems work and the pathways leading to the
disease to understand the healing process.
Some healing methods use a multifaceted approach,
combining Western medicine with

During experiences of stress, specific target
organs manifest more frequent physiological
changes and may therefore be more susceptible
to the neurochemical mediators of
stress. These target organs vary with the individual.
Any organ can be a target organ. Some
people may have only one target organ (e.g.,
the gastrointestinal tract or the respiratory
system), whereas others may have several target
organs. Genetics, emotions, personality,
and environmental factors have all been suggested
as explanations for target organs.
Using Borysenko's model, the more common
disorders and their target organs are discussed
in the following sections based on two categories:
nervous system-related and immune system-related
disorders. A review of the role of
stress in the development of the pathophysiology
is followed by current research examples.


- <b>DISORDERS MEDIATED BY THE
AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM</b>


When a threat is perceived, organs that are
innervated by nervous tissue are acted on by
excessive secretions of the stress hormones.

[p. <i>150</i>]

Bronchial asthma is an illness in which a
pronounced secretion of bronchial fluids and
constriction of the smooth muscle surrounding
the bronchi restrict air movement. These
effects produce a suffocating sensation, and
the work of breathing increases dramatically.
Asthmatic attacks can result in the need for
emergency treatment and can sometimes be
fatal. Some studies have linked the onset of
asthmatic attacks with anxiety and others with
an overprotective childhood.


Currently, Œ≤-adrenergic drugs are the first
line of treatment. Relaxation techniques, such
as mental imagery, autogenic training, and
meditation, may be as effective as medications
in delaying the onset and reducing the
severity of the attacks (Henri-Benitez et al.,
1990).


Tension headaches are produced by sympathetically
mediated contractions of muscles
of the forehead, eyes, neck, and jaw. Tension
builds as the parasympathetic inhibition of
muscle contraction is overpowered by sympathetic
activity that increases contraction of the
muscles and subsequent pain. Lower back
pain can result from the same process. Over-the-counter
medications such as aspirin and
acetaminophen are the most common treatments.
Tension headaches and low back pain
have also been shown to be relieved through
the use of meditation, mental imagery, and
biofeedback (Blanchard et al., 1985).


Unlike tension headaches, which are produced
by nervous tension in the facial muscles,
a migraine headache is a vascular headache.
Approximately 16 to 18 million people
suffer from this type of pain. Migraines usually
begin in adolescence and rarely develop
after the age of 40. Four times as many
women are treated for migraines as men. Migraines
usually involve pain over either the
left or right side of the head, usually not both,
and headaches may last from 2 hours to days
(Gallagher, 1990; Thomas &amp; Wimbush,
1999). There are two types of migraine headaches:
those with a prodrome, warning, or
aura (classic migraine) and those without.
Once the prodrome begins, the physiological
pattern of the migraine is started (Saper,
Silverstein, Gordon, &amp; Hammel, 1993).


Migraines are thought to be the result of a
sympathetic response to the baroreceptors of
the carotid artery. Serotonin and norephineprine
are the mediators of neural transmission
and vascular reactivity. The action of serotonin
varies with the size of the blood
vessel, causing constriction of large vessels in
the external carotid tree and dilation of small
vessels. Serotonin also promotes platelet aggregation.
Norepinephrine levels increase
during a migraine, causing vasoconstriction in
the peripheral vascular bed (Thomas &amp;
Wimbush, 1999).


The response to the sympathetic stimulation
involves a rapid constriction followed by
a rapid dilation. The constriction is responsible
for the prodrome and is often recognized
by the client as a warning of an impending attack.
During the dilation portion, blood moves
quickly from the periphery to flood the cerebral
vasculature. The change in vascular pressure,
combined with humoral secretions, is
thought to be the source for the intense pain
often associated with migraines. Pain is usually
inhibited during the vasoconstrictive
phase of the aura until the aura fades and
vasodilation occurs. This eliminates the pain
inhibition and the migraine headache begins
(Solomon &amp; Lipton, 1990). Symptoms often
described by clients include a flash of light
followed by intense throbbing, dizziness, and
nausea.


Migraines do not usually occur during
the stressful period but rather hours later. This
may account for the association of migraines
with weekends and vacations (Benedittis, Lorenzetti,

[p. <i>151</i>]

Several medications are available for migraine
treatment; current research, however,
indicates that biofeedback and mental imagery
can be equally effective and have fewer
side effects. An effective strategy to avoid migraines
is to avoid foods and beverages that
may trigger a migraine and participate in daily
exercise. Exercise increases vasodilation,
which reduces the risk for developing a migraine.


<i><b>Skeletal Muscle Conditions</b></i>


Excessive contraction of the jaw muscles
can lead to temporomandibular (TMJ). Often,
persons are not aware that they have this problem.
It is usually discovered during a dental
exam when signs of clenching and grinding of
teeth are noted. Other symptoms include jaw
muscle pain, clicking or popping sounds when
chewing, grinding of teeth during sleep, tension
headaches, and earaches. Often, TMJ is
so severe that the client cannot open his or her
mouth wide enough to eat. Like migraines,
TMJ is often associated with the inability to
express feelings of anger. Other behaviors are
also associated with TMJ symptoms, including
activities such as resting the chin on the
hand, chewing gum excessively, and nail biting.
Severe cases require that a mouth brace
be worn at night while sleeping. Exercises are
available, and surgery may be required. Relaxation
techniques, including biofeedback
and progressive muscle relaxation, have been
shown to be effective in decreasing the muscle
tension associated with TMJ (Eskola,
Ylipaavalniemi, &amp; Turtola, 1985; Thomas &amp;
Wimbush, 1999).


<b><i>Gastrointestinal Disorders</i></b>


Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized
by bouts of abdominal pain or tenderness,
cramps, diarrhea, nausea, constipation,
and excessive flatulence. These may be associated
with a change in either the frequency or
the texture of the stool. Symptoms must be
present for at least 3 months. Changes in
bowel habits include diarrhea alternating with
constipation, a feeling of bloating or abdominal
distension, and passage of mucus. The
physiological mechanism for IBS symptoms
seems to be an abnormal pain perception. Patients
with IBS report a low pain threshold
(Whitehead, 1992).


Irritable bowel syndrome is considered to
be the result of excessive sympathetic neural
stimulation to one or more areas of the gastrointestinal
tract, with symptoms varying
among individuals. This stress-related physical
illness is most commonly associated with
anxiety and depression. The hypothalamus is
closely associated with emotional regulation
and appetite regulation and may be part of the
mind-body link for this condition (Mitchell &amp;
Drossman, 1997).


Data suggest that childhood trauma may
be related to IBS later in life. Loss of parents,
through death or divorce, has been reported
more frequently by IBS patients than by
healthy control subjects. It has also been reported
that more than 50% of medical clinic
patients with gastrointestinal disorders describe
being abused sexually as children compared
with 37% of medical clinic patients
with other organic diseases (Whitehead,
1992).

[p. <i>152</i>]

Numerous controlled studies have demonstrated
that a combination of psychological
treatment approaches with standard
medical therapy provides more benefits for
IBS patients than medical treatment alone
(Rowingson, 1993). Diets and medications
are often prescribed, depending on the presenting
symptoms. Several studies have incorporated
relaxation and cognitive skills. Interventions
include thermal biofeedback,
progressive muscle relaxation, mental imagery,
cognitive reappraisal, and behavior modification
to reduce anxiety with good results
(Guthrie, Creed, Dawson, &amp; Tomenson,
1991). The events that result in ulcers and colitis
begin with excessive sympathetic activity.
Increased secretions of norepinephrine cause
constriction of the vasculature in the lining of
the stomach, leading to a decrease in the production
of mucus by the inner lining of the
stomach wall. The purpose of the mucus is to
protect the stomach from the strong digestive
enzymes in the stomach. If the ratio of mucus
to digestive enzymes is disrupted, the inner
lining becomes susceptible to the damage of
the digestive enzymes. The stomach may actually
begin to digest itself, resulting in a hole
in the stomach wall. Ulcers were one of the
first conditions that Selye associated with undue
stress. Physicians have noted a strong association
between anxiety and the symptoms
of ulcers (most notably sharp stomach pains)
(Mitchell &amp; Drossman, 1997).


The colon is also prone to ulceration,
with similar etiology resulting in colitis (inflammation
of the inner lining of the colon).
Relaxation techniques are often recommended
along with a special diet to control
the symptoms of this disease (Mitchell &amp;
Drossman, 1997).


For years it was thought that stress was
the primary cause for stomach ulcers. Marshall,
however, demonstrated that 75% of ulcers
are caused by the bacteria Helicobacter, a
carcinogen (Ubell, 1995). This bacterium can
settle in the lining of the stomach, creating an
open wound that is further irritated by digestive
acids, resulting in moderate to severe ulceration.
Antibiotics constitute the treatment
of choice and have been effective for many
people with ulcers. The following questions
remain: What makes some people more susceptible
to the bacteria than others, and why
are antibiotics effective in only 75% of the
people with ulcers?


<b><i>Cardiovascular Conditions</i></b>


The cardiovascular system as the target
organ of stress is possibly the most researched
area. There are two major links between the
stress response and coronary heart disease.
The first link is through hypertension and
the second is related to atherosclerosis. The
American Heart Association (AHA, 1991)
estimates that cardiovascular disease is responsible
for the death of one person every 32
seconds. The primary direct pathologic mechanisms
of coronary artery disease are atherosclerosis
and chronic injury to the coronary
arterial endothelium (Manuck, Marsland,
Kaplan, &amp; Williams, 1995). The risk of atherosclerosis
is closely linked to periodic or
sustained elevations in blood pressure
(Kaplan, Petersson, &amp; Manuck, 1991; Muller,
Tofler, &amp; Stone, 1989), and both conditions
have been linked to increased sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) reactivity (Kaplan et
al., 1991; Manuck, Olsson, &amp; Hjemdahl,
1992; Potempa, 1994).


<i>Hypertension</i>


The most consistent and profound response
during stress is elevation of blood
pressure (Boone, 1991). More than 16 million
Americans have elevated blood pressure. Hypertension
is twice as frequent among African
Americans than among Caucasians (Calhoun,
1992). In addition, the incidence of hypertension
in African American women is four times
that of Caucasian women. The incidence of
hypertension is higher in men than in women
until women reach menopause (AHA, 1999).
Hypertension is defined by the World Health
Organization as chronically elevated blood
pressure exceeding 160/95 mmHg. Borderline
hypertension is defined as blood pressure
higher than 140/90 mmHg. The risk of developing

[p. <i>153</i>]

High blood pressure can result from increased
cardiac output, increased peripheral
resistance, and increased blood volume due to
decreased sodium and water excretion.
Vasopressin (ADH) also increases blood volume.
The overall effect of these stress hormones
is to elevate blood pressure considerably
above an individual's resting levels to
transport blood to areas where it is needed.
Stress produces the same response, even when
there is no conscious attempt to move from a
stressor (Guyton, 1996).


Hypertension has been shown to be
strongly linked to stressful lifestyles and to
patterns of exaggerated response to stress.
Genetically hypertensive animals show evidence
of increased responses, such as
greatly elevated levels of plasma norepinephrine
and epinephrine, to acute stressors
such as footshock (Chiueh &amp; McCarty, 1981),
anticipation of footshock (McCarty, Chiueh,
&amp; Kopin, 1978), and immobilization (Kvetnansky,
McCarty, &amp; Thoa, 1979) when compared
to age-matched normotensives. As further
evidence of the influential role of
catecholamines in the development of hypertension,
perinatal sympathectomy and treatment
with adrenergic antagonists have been
shown to prevent the development of hypertension
in spontaneously hypertensive rats
(Lee, Triggle, &amp; Cheung, 1987; O'Sullivan &amp;
Harrap, 1995; Wu &amp; Berecel, 1993).


In humans, strong links have been demonstrated
between SNS and cardiovascular reactivity
and the risk of hypertension
(Nebjesm, Matthews, &amp; Krantz, 1989). From
a social environmental perspective, associations
have been found between job strain, defined
as high psychological demands and lack
of control, and elevated ambulatory blood
pressure (Schnall, Schwartz, Landsbergis,
Warren, &amp; Pickering, 1992). Because of the
strong evidence that hypertension and job
stress are correlated, high blood pressure has
sometimes been used as an index of job stress
(Pickering, Devereux, &amp; James, 1996).


Cardiovascular reactivity has been proposed
as a hypothetical mechanism contributing
to the development of both coronary artery
disease and hypertension. High
cardiovascular reactivity has been described
by Obrist (1981) and Potempa (1994) as a response
to psychological stressors that exceeds
the metabolic demand, resulting in a proportionately
greater oxygen consumption for behavioral
versus physical stimuli (Turner,
Carroll, Hanson, &amp; Sims, 1988). Whereas exercise
tasks are associated with increased cardiac
output and decreased peripheral resistance
(Sherwood, Allen, Obrist, &amp; Langer,
1986), psychological stressors are associated
with slight reductions in cardiac output and
increases in peripheral resistance. In the latter
instance, there is preparation for "fight or
flight." When the physical exertion does not
occur, the increase in cardiac output is inappropriate,
resulting in a compensatory
vasoconstriction and elevation in blood pressure
(Light, 1987; Sherwood &amp; Turner, 1992).


Increased systolic blood pressure reactivity
has been found both in borderline and in
established hypertensives compared to control
subjects for active coping tasks and for physical
challenges such as exercise and cold
pressor stimuli, although the reactivity to the
coping tasks is greater (Pickering &amp; Gerin,
1990). Exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure
responses have also been found in individuals
with a family history of hypertension
(Matthews &amp; Rakaczky, 1986).


Increased Œ±-adrenergic tone and reactivity
are reflected in increased peripheral vascular
resistance (Weidmann, Grimm, &amp; Meier,
1980), setting in motion a positive feedback
pathway to facilitate the development of sustained
hypertension. Because the vessels have
higher resistance to flow, there is higher pressure,
which in turn results in an increase in arterial
wall thickness and remodeling (Egan,
1992). Enhanced reactivity to all vasoconstrictors
has been a consistent finding in established
hypertension (Egan, 1992).


Several factors have been postulated to
affect cardiovascular reactivity through SNS
channels. Nuclei in the brain stem and medulla
are involved in cardiovascular regulation,

[p. <i>154</i>]

Endorphins and enkephalins have been
proposed as inhibitory to central sympathetic
activity. Their deficiency may result in greater
adrenergic cardiovascular responses to stress
through the absence of the normal inhibition
(McCubbin et al., 1992).


Hyperinsulinemia is frequently observed
in both animals and humans with hypertension
(Reaven, 1991). Insulin resistance, occurring
in diabetics, results in compensatory
high levels of insulin production, high
triglyceride levels, and glucose intolerance
(Stern, Morales, Haffner, &amp; Valdez, 1992). Increased
SNS activity results, along with proliferation
of arteriolar smooth muscle cells, in
response to the high levels of insulin
(DeFronzo &amp; Ferrannini, 1991). Again, the
increase in sympathetic tone is proposed as
the link between stress, hyperinsulinemia, and
hypertension development (Skyler, Donahue,
Marks, Thompson, &amp; Schneiderman, 1992).


The medical management of hypertension
includes a variety of medications used in
several ways. Several other mechanisms,
however, may also contribute to the resolution
of uncontrolled blood pressure. More conservative
mechanisms to control blood pressure
include dietary interventions to control
weight; limited use of alcohol and caffeine;
low-salt, low-cholesterol, and low-fat diets;
and exercise (Boone, 1991).


Behavioral and psychological treatments
of hypertension include psychotherapy, relaxation,
and biofeedback. Biofeedback seems to
be most effective when combined with pharmacology.
Medications have been reduced because
of behavioral interventions and may decrease
end organ damage (Thomas &amp;
Wimbush, 1999).


In summary, exaggerated sympathetic responses
have been found consistently in people
with hypertension or borderline hypertension
and who have family histories of
hypertension. In many instances, this SNS hyperactivity
is correlated with a high level of
job stress, high psychological demands, and
lack of control. The balance of catecholamines
and the inhibitory endorphins and
enkephalins and hyperinsulinemia as a mediator
of increased SNS activity has been proposed
as a meaningful link to the development
of hypertension.


<b><i>Coronary Artery Disease</i></b>


Coronary artery disease also has been
thought to have a psychosomatic component.
The three stages of coronary artery disease are
atherogenesis, atherosclerosis, and arteriosclerosis.
With atherogenesis, the initial stage
of a fatty streak appears on the inner lining of
the artery wall. There is evidence that this can
occur as early as ages 3 to 5 years. As the fatty
streak continues to develop around the perimeter
of the artery and grow in length, a buildup
of plaque occurs. This plaque results in a narrowing
of the inside of the artery and is referred
to as atherosclerosis. As the plaque accumulates,
other constituents in the blood are
attracted to the site, including calcium, resulting
in an increased resistance in blood flow
and increased blood pressure. As the individual
ages, plaque hardens, resulting in rigid artery
walls that no longer can constrict or dilate.
This compounds the effect of high blood
pressure and is one reason why resting pressure
increases with age. At the third stage, arteriosclerosis,
the arteries become hard and
possibly occluded from the flow of blood.
When the blood flow to any organ is impeded,
signs of ischemia develop, resulting in pain
(angina) or death of tissue (infarction). The
degree of coronary artery blockage and the location
of the affected artery determine the severity

[p. <i>155</i>]

Persistent stress, low social class, lack of
control in one's job, job strain (defined by
high psychological demands and lack of control),
and certain enduring dispositional attributes
are believed to affect arterial lesion progression
and the development of coronary
artery disease over time (Bosma et al., 1997;
Cohen, Kaplan, &amp; Manuck, 1994; Everson,
Lynch, &amp; Chesney, 1997). Although current
thinking is equivocal regarding the legitimacy
of the Type A behavior concept, a considerable
body of research supports the association
between competitiveness, time urgency, hostility,
and drivenness and the development of
coronary heart disease (Matthews, 1982,
1988; Review Panel, 1981).


Community-based prospective studies
have suggested that higher hostility, as measured
by questionnaire (Barefoot, Dodge, &amp;
Peterson, 1989) or interview, predicts both the
severity (Seaward, 1997) and the progression
(Dembroski, MacDougall, &amp; Costa, 1989;
Hecker, Chesney, &amp; Black, 1988; Helmers,
Krantz, &amp; Howell, 1993; Julkunen, Salonen,
&amp; Kaplan, 1994) of coronary artery disease.
Hostile individuals have shown excessive cardiovascular
reactivity in the form of heart rate
and sustained blood pressure responses to interpersonal
laboratory stressors. Laboratory
stressors producing this finding were conflict
discussion tasks (Hardy &amp; Smith, 1988;
Smith &amp; Allred, 1989), unsolvable anagrams
with misleading instructions (Weidner,
Friend, &amp; Ficarrotto, 1989), and anagram
tasks accompanied by harassment (Suarez,
Harlan, &amp; Peoples, 1993; Suarez, Kuhn,
Schanberg, Williams, &amp; Zimmerman, 1998;
Suarez &amp; Williams, 1990).


In summary, chronic elevations in
Cortisol and sympathomimetic neuromediators
appear to facilitate the development of
coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis.
Stressors in the social environment, recurrent
hostility, and a hard-driving disposition are
additional influences for which there is strong
research support.


- <b>IMMUNE SYSTEM-RELATED
DISORDERS</b>


Emotional stress seems to change the molecular
structure of biochemical agents or
neuropeptides and to suppress the number
and functions of several important leukocytes.
Stress hormones (Cortisol) may also
decrease the effectiveness of leukocytes. During
this process, the efficiency of protective
mechanisms is decreased and the body mechanisms
become more vulnerable to exogenous
and endogenous antigens. Diseases that
are the result of immune system disorders can
be classified as exogenous (overactive or
underactive) or endogenous (overactive or
underactive).


Cohen, Tyrrell, and Smith (1991) found
that the common cold is related to excessive
stress. As B lymphocyte cells decrease, the
body becomes more vulnerable to the influences
of the viruses that produce the common
cold. Colds and influenza are classified into
the category of exogenous underreaction in
Borysenko's model because there are not
enough B lymphocytes to fight off the exogenous
antigen (Cohen &amp; Williamson, 1991).


An allergic reaction is initiated when a
foreign substance (antigen), such as pollen,
bee spores, dust, or mold, enters the body.
When an antigen is present, granulocytes secrete
histamines, which interact with the antigen.
When there is an overactive immune response
to exogenous antigens, the excess
histamines cause swelling of mucus membrane
tissue if the antigen is inhaled or of skin
tissue in the case of infection. Some case studies
have demonstrated that an actual contact
with the allergen (an antigen capable of initiating
this kind of reaction in an allergic individual)
is not necessary to trigger the allergic
response. In some individuals, allergic reactions

[p. <i>156</i>]

Tissue inflammation may also occur as a
result of an immune response to normal cells
(endogenous) that are perceived to be foreign
antigens. In this situation, components of the
immune system begin to attack healthy tissue,
mistaking it for a foreign substance, or the
healthy tissue may be damaged by the products
of the immune response.


Rheumatoid arthritis, a joint and connective
tissue disease, occurs when synovial
membrane tissue becomes inflamed and
swells, causing the joint to become inflamed.
A substance known as the rheumatoid factor, a
protein found in the blood, is thought to be associated
with this disease. There is evidence
that rheumatoid arthritis has a genetic link,
and it also has an association with stress. The
severity of arthritis pain is often related to episodes
of stress, especially suppressed anger.
Treatment ranges from pain relievers (aspirin)
to steroid injections (cortisone), depending on
the severity of the pain and rate of joint deterioration.
Relaxation techniques are recommended
as a complementary intervention to
help reduce symptoms (Moran, 1991).


<b><i>Cancer</i></b>


Cancer is one of the most bewildering
diseases of the modern day, affecting one in
four Americans. Currently, the most effective
treatment is prevention and early detection.
The American Cancer Society (1994) defines
cancer as a "large group of diseases all characterized
by uncontrolled growth and spread of
abnormal cells" (p. 4). There are many different
types of cancer, and etiologies of each are
not completely understood. There are also
many theories regarding the development of
cancer. The most prevalent theory is that there
is a gene in the DNA that produces an abnormal
cell. Such genes may be inherited, and
some may be taken into the body from external
sources (carcinogens). The production of
an abnormal cell in the body is not uncommon.
The body routinely produces mutant
cells, and this process is kept in check by a
normally functioning immune system, primarily
through T cells and natural killer (NK)
cells (Levenson &amp; Bemis, 1991).


When a cell's genetic structure deviates
from the normal cell structure, it is recognized
by the immune system as an endogenous antigen
and is typically destroyed by the cytotoxic
T lymphocytes and NK cells. If these immune
responses are depressed, the possibility of a
cancerous growth is increased. If the mutant
cell is not recognized, it multiplies much more
quickly than a normal cell, resulting in a progressively
enlarging tumor. In addition, because
of the inability of the mutant cells to
produce the enzymes necessary to perform
normal cellular function, they take nutrients
from healthy cells. Unlike normal tissue, cancer
cells are not self-contained and are able to
detach from their original site (cell type) and
move to other areas throughout the body (metastasis)
(Seaward, 1997; Temoshak, 1997).


Carcinogens have produced tumors in
both laboratory animals and humans. Researchers
are searching for endogenous factors,
such as personality characteristics, that
may play a role in the disease process. Although
one can certainly not claim that one
fourth of the population has similar personality
traits that put them at risk for cancer, certain
traits have been found to be common
among individuals who develop cancer. The
incidence of cancer appears to be higher
among those who have difficulty expressing
their emotions, have low self-esteem, and experience
feelings of rejection. Interestingly,
these same traits appear in persons with
codependent or addictive personalities
(Temoshak, 1997).


Traditional treatments for cancer include
cytotoxic drugs, radiation, and surgery. Several
studies (Siegel, 1986) have demonstrated

[p. <i>157</i>]

- <b>DIAGNOSIS OF
PSYCHOSOMATIC ILLNESS</b>


Diagnosis begins with a multifocal assessment.
The clinical history must be focused on
the whole person‚Äîon the patient's story as
told by him or her and not just on the presenting
physical symptoms. A careful social, cultural,
educational, occupational, cognitive,
emotional, and family history can clarify potential
relationships between the person's
presenting problem and other contributing
(stressful and nonstressful) factors in his or
her life. The use of psychometric instruments
can answer specific questions regarding the
psychological status of the individual. There
are a wide variety of instruments available for
use in the clinical area. These were discussed
in detail in Chapter 4, which focused on this
group of diagnostic tools.


In addition to the use of psychometric
measures in the assessment and diagnosis of
psychosomatic illness, it is equally important
to assess the physiological aspects of the
stress response. The measurement of temperature,
heart rate, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram
pattern, in addition to a diary of
events, contributes to a complete overview of
the patient's holistic status (Thomas &amp;
Wimbush, 1999).


- <b>SOMATOFORM
DISORDERS</b>


Somatoform disorders are defined as a group
of disorders in which there are physical
symptoms suggesting a physiological etiology,
but no organic disease or physiological
abnormalities are found. Because no evidence
of physical disease is identified, the
presumption is made that the physical problems
are psychological in origin. This group
of disorders, primarily classified as psychiatric
disorders, is so widespread that it may involve
as many as 30% to 40% of the medical
clients seen in general and family practice
settings (Fava, 1992).


The fourth edition of <i>Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV;</i>
American Psychiatric Association [APA],
1994) lists several distinct and possibly related
disorders. They differ from the category
Psychological Factors Affecting Medical
Conditions because no medical abnormalities
are found in a somatoform disorder. The new
<i>DSM-IV</i> category of Psychological Factors
Affecting Medical Conditions may be useful
with clients experiencing psychophysiological
disorders. The primary feature of this
condition is the presence of one or more specific
psychological or behavioral features that
negatively affect a general medical condition.
The seven disorders are body dysmorphic disorder,
conversion disorder, hypochondriasis,
somatization disorder, pain disorder, undifferentiated
somatoform disorder, and somatoform
disorder not otherwise specified. The
client diagnosed with one of these disorders
often has physical symptoms that worsen during
a life crisis but is not aware of the relationships
between the symptom and stressful
events. There is evidence of "doctor shopping"
and of strained doctor-patient relationships
in this population. This group of clients
may submit to unnecessary surgical procedures.
In addition, because health care providers
are searching for the organic cause of specific
symptoms, existing pathophysiology
may be overlooked. Members of this group of
clients may abuse psychoactive substances
because of overuse of prescribed medications.


Many of these clients report a history of
avoiding social or occupational activities. An
obsessive-compulsive personality trait or depression
are not uncommon in this group.
These clients experience spiritual distress
and are likely to resist referral to mental
health professionals. The intensity of the
physical symptoms often decreases with

[p. <i>158</i>]

<b><i>Body Dysmorphic Disorder
(Dysmorphophobia)</i></b>


Body dysmorphic disorder is the preoccupation
with an imagined flaw in appearance
in a normal-appearing person. Clients with
this disorder most frequently focus on a facial
defect. They often are not concerned about
physical deformity in other parts of the body.
The client may focus on this defect for hours
each day, and this thought may dominate his
or her life with resulting impairment in social
and work roles and in other important areas of
functioning. The preoccupation is not better
accounted for by another mental disorder
(e.g., dissatisfaction with body shape and size
in anorexia nervosa). The social isolation and
depression related to their physical appearance
may lead to repeated hospitalizations,
suicide attempts, and even completed suicides.
The key to diagnosis is the client's excessive
concern regarding the perceived physical
defect. Persons may present with this
problem as early as the teen years through the
twenties. They often seek plastic surgery,
which will not correct their distorted ideation.
No familial pattern or predisposing factors
have been identified, and it is reported equally
in males and females. It is a chronic condition
that usually continues for several years (APA,
1994; Thomas &amp; Wimbush, 1999).


<b><i>Conversion Disorder</i></b>


Conversion disorder is the presentation of
an alteration or loss of a sensory motor function
that is not the result of a physiological
disorder. Conversion disorders present in response
to a catastrophic event such as a threat
of loss or harm, which results in the development
of physical symptoms. These symptoms
lead to serious deficits in functioning. Although
conversion disorders are not often reported
today, this was a common diagnosis 20
years ago. The most common conversion
symptoms include paralysis, seizure, and disturbance
in coordination or blindness. Psychological
factors are thought to be associated
with the symptom or deficit because the initiation
or exacerbation of the symptom is preceded
by conflict or other stressors. This
group of clients may present with the complete
array or neurological symptoms (APA,
1994).


The symptoms experienced by the client
are serious but not intentionally produced (as
in factitious disorder or malingering). The
symptom cannot, after appropriate investigation,
be fully explained by a general medical
condition, by the direct effect of a substance,
or as a culturally sanctioned behavior or experience.
The symptom or experience causes
clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning. The symptom is not limited to
pain or sexual dysfunction, does not occur exclusively
during the course of somatization
disorder, and is not better accounted for by another
mental disorder. The type of symptom
or deficit is specified (motor, sensory, seizures
or convulsions, or mixed presentation). The
key to identification of a conversion disorder
is that the person appears calm although the
symptoms are serious. The calmness and apparent
lack of concern are referred to as la
belle indifference (APA, 1994; Thomas &amp;
Wimbush, 1999).


Onset occurs most commonly during adolescence
and early adulthood, although it
may appear at any age. Conversion disorder is
more common in women than in men, and
there is evidence of a familial pattern. Often, a
predisposing physical illness with similar
symptoms has been present either in the client
or in a person close to the client (APA, 1994).
Conversion disorder has been reported more
frequently in rural populations and in clients
with lower socioeconomic and educational
status.


Clients who experience a conversion disorder
derive primary gain in that the stress that
they experienced from the trauma is no longer
felt; secondary gain also is obtained in that,

[p. <i>159</i>]

<b><i>Hypochondriasis</i></b>


Hypochondriasis has five major diagnostic
criteria. First, the patient has a preoccupation
with bodily functions (focusing on heartbeat,
breathing, digestion, or a minor physical
ailment such as a small scratch or cough).
Second, the patient interprets the symptoms as
a serious illness, despite appropriate medical
evaluation and reassurances. Third, the preoccupation
is not a delusional intensity (as in delusional
disorder, somatic type) and is not restricted
to a particular concern about
appearance (as in body dysmorphic disorder).
The client can acknowledge the possibility
that he or she is exaggerating the extent of the
disease or that the disease may not be present.
Fourth, the preoccupation causes clinically
significant distress and impairment in social,
occupational, and other important areas of
functioning. Finally, the preoccupation lasts at
least 6 months. This preoccupation is not
better accounted for by generalized anxiety
disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
panic, a major depressive episode, separation
anxiety, or another somatoform disorder
(APA, 1994; Thomas &amp; Wimbush, 1999).


Hypochondria most commonly occurs
between 20 and 30 years of age; it may appear
at any age. It is seen equally in males and females,
and no familial pattern exists. Predisposing
factors include stress and past experience
with the presenting symptoms. Usually,
the condition is chronic, with remission and
exacerbation of the symptoms. It is most important
in the diagnosis that an early stage of a
medical condition is not overlooked. Doctor
shopping is common with this group of clients
because they cannot get the answers they
want. These clients resist referral to mental
health practitioners (APA, 1994; Thomas &amp;
Wimbush, 1999).


<b><i>Somatization Disorder</i></b>


The client with somatization disorder has
many physical complaints that occur with no
identified organic basis. If a medical condition
is present, the physical complaints or resulting
social or occupational impairment are
in excess of what would be expected from the
history, physical exam, or laboratory findings.
The identification of somatization must include
four pain symptoms in differing sites or
functions (e.g., head, abdomen, back, joints,
extremities, chest, rectum, during menstruation,
during sexual intercourse, or during urination).
It also includes a history of two gastrointestinal
symptoms other than pain (e.g.,
nausea, bloating, vomiting other than during
pregnancy, diarrhea, or intolerance of several
different foods). The diagnostic criteria also
includes one sexual or reproductive symptom
other than pain (e.g., sexual indifference,
erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction, irregular
menses, excessive menstrual bleeding, or
vomiting throughout pregnancy). The final
criteria for this diagnostic category is a history
of one pseudoneurological symptom suggesting
a neurological condition but not limited to
pain (e.g., conversion symptoms such as impaired
coordination or balance, paralysis or
localized weakness, difficulty swallowing or
complaints of a lump in the throat, aphonia,
urinary retention, hallucinations, loss of touch
or pain sensation, double vision, blindness,
deafness, and seizures; dissociative symptoms
such as amnesia; or loss of consciousness
other than fainting). The symptoms are not intentionally
produced or feigned (as in factitious
disorder or malingering) (APA, 1994;
Thomas &amp; Wimbush, 1999).


The difference between somatization and
conversion disorders is based mainly on the
number of signs and symptoms; somatization
disorder includes multiple physical symptoms
in several body systems. The most common
complaints are pseudoneurological, gastrointestinal,

[p. <i>160</i>]

Somatization disorder symptoms begin
during the teen years and sometimes in the
twenties and include physical symptoms that
have occurred for several years. The client
seeks treatment and has significant impairment
in social, occupational, or other areas of
functioning. Menstrual difficulties are often
one of the earliest complaints in females.
Younger clients may present with a variety of
initial complaints, such as abdominal pain,
depression, headaches, or seizures. The diagnosis
is not often seen in males. A familial
tendency is seen with somatization disorders.
Somatization disorder is a chronic problem.
The client's symptoms vary in seriousness,
but it is unusual for a year to pass without the
client seeing a health care provider (APA,
1994; Thomas &amp; Wimbush, 1999).


<b><i>Pain Disorder</i></b>


The client with pain disorder is preoccupied
with complaints of pain in one or more
anatomical sites, and the pain is of sufficient
severity to warrant clinical attention. The pain
is intense enough to cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning.
Psychological factors are thought to have an
important role in the onset, severity, exacerbation,
or maintenance of the pain. The pain is
not voluntarily produced, and the diagnosis is
not appropriate if the pain is better accounted
for by another mental or physical disorder.
The diagnosis is specified as either acute (duration
of less than 6 months) or chronic (duration
of 6 months or longer). Pain disorder usually
begins during the third or fourth decade
and occurs more frequently in women. The
more common complaints include headache
and musculoskeletal pain. Some evidence of a
familial pattern has been noted (APA, 1994;
Thomas &amp; Wimbush, 1999).


Clients in this diagnostic category report
a history of excessive analgesic use with no
pain relief and frequently request surgery. It is
not unusual for the client to have adopted a
lifestyle of an invalid. Clients who are depressed
or who have pain related to a terminal
illness are at increased risk for suicide attempts.
The clients in this diagnostic category
resist the possibility that psychological factors
may be involved. They spend considerable
time and energy searching for care. In many
clients, the diagnosis of major depression is
also appropriate (APA, 1994; Thomas &amp;
Wimbush, 1999).


<b><i>Somatoform Disorder Not
Otherwise Specified</i></b>


This category includes disorders with
somatoform symptoms that do not meet the
criteria for any specific somatoform disorder.
For example, pseudocyesis is a false belief accompanied
by physical signs of pregnancy
and may include abdominal enlargement, reduced
menstrual flow, amenorrhea, subjective
sensation of fetal movement, nausea, breast
engorgement and secretions, and labor pains
at the expected date of delivery. Endocrine
changes may be present, but there is no evidence
of a medical condition that causes endocrine
changes (a hormone-secreting tumor).
A second complaint in this category is
nonpsychotic hypochondriacal symptoms of
less than 6 months' duration. A third example
of a disorder in this category is that involving
unexplained physical complaints, such as fatigue
or body weakness, of less than 6 months'
duration that are not due to another mental
disorder (APA, 1994).


<b><i>Undifferentiated
Somatoform Disorder</i></b>


This diagnostic category is used when the
client's symptoms and physical findings do
not meet the description of somatoform disorder.
The client has fewer physical complaints

[p. <i>161</i>]

- <b>TREATMENT OF SOMATOFORM
DISORDERS</b>


Treatment of clients in this diagnostic category
has traditionally been limited to insight-oriented
psychotherapy. The success of this
approach has been limited. A holistic framework
is more appropriate in situations in
which it is difficult to determine a physiological
basis for the client's symptoms. The clinician
must take into account physical,
psychosocial, and spiritual sources for the behavior
that is being demonstrated. Although
clients usually resist suggestions that they
may have psychological reasons for these disorders,
they do respond to a caring environment
in which their symptoms are respected
and they are not dismissed as "crazy" or
"neurotic." When the clinician seriously considers
the client's expressions of pain and
other symptoms (the client's whole story of
illness), the clinician is providing holistic
care. When this occurs, the client and the
health care provider are more likely to become
mutually engaged in a meaningful plan
for recovery (Thomas &amp; Wimbush, 1999).


- <b>REVIEW OF NURSING
RESEARCH</b>


Very little nursing research has focused on
theory building in the area of stress and so-called
psychosomatic diseases. Exceptions
are the work of Page and colleagues in the
area of pain and its immune-suppressive effects
(Page &amp; Ben-Eliyahu, 1997; Page, Ben-Eliyahu,
&amp; Liebeskind, 1994; Page, Ben-Eliyahu,
&amp; Yirmiya, 1993) and that of Zeller
and colleagues in psychoneuroimmunology
(Swanson, Cronin-Stubbs, Zeller, Kessler, &amp;
Bieliauskas, 1993a, 1993b; Swanson, Zeller,
&amp; Spear, 1994; Zeller, McCain, &amp; Swanson,
1996). Although impairment of immune
function in association with exposure to a variety
of stressful stimuli is thoroughly discussed
elsewhere in this volume (see Chapter
3), this relationship is an important illustration
of how stress interacts with physiological
function (Cohen, Kaplan, Cunnick, Manuck,
&amp; Rabin, 1992; Cohen, Koyle, Skoner, Rabin,
&amp; Baltney, 1997). The only example that will
be discussed here in detail is that of pain as a
stressful experience that can lead to immune
suppression (Kusnecov &amp; Rabin, 1994; Page
&amp; Ben-Eliyahu, 1997).


Pain generally produces activation of the
HPA axis and the SNS, increasing the levels
of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol.
Cortisol elevations in conjunction with surgical
trauma are related to immune suppression
(Pollock, Babcock, &amp; Romsdahl, 1984;
Pollock, Lotova, &amp; Stanford, 1991). Surgery-induced
immune suppression is of particular
clinical concern because of the increased risks
of infection and metastatic disease in cancer
patients (Page &amp; Ben-Eliyahu, 1997).


Analgesic and anesthetic interventions
have been shown to reduce both the neuroendocrine
response to surgical pain (Anand,
Sippel, &amp; Aynsley-Green, 1987) and the immune
effects (Salomaki, Leppaluoto, &amp;
Laitinen, 1993; Tonnesen, 1989). In a comparison
study of animal responses to surgery
and morphine, retention and metastasis of tumor
cells were evaluated. A substantial increase
in the number of retained radiolabeled

[p. <i>162</i>]

A search of the Cumulative Index for
Nursing and Allied Health Literature database
revealed 40 research citations related to stress
and health between 1985 and 1998. Sixteen of
these could be clearly identified as nursing
studies. Of 182 stress citations relating to cardiovascular
conditions, including hypertension,
61 were clearly identifiable as research
conducted by nurses. Of 25 research citations
relating immune function to stress, at least 9
were nursing studies. Examples of nursing research
topics included quality of life, predictors
of recovery from acute conditions, health
and illness experiences, stress-modulating interventions
(e.g., imagery, relaxation, meditation,
hypnosis, and massage), and the effects
of various care models for people living with
various health conditions. In addition, nursing
research studies have addressed the outcome
of pain relief, stabilized or improved immune
function, and cardiovascular response. Table
7.1 provides a summary of nursing intervention
studies published between 1987 and 1998
that used physiological outcomes.


- <b>CONCLUSIONS</b>


Much attention is currently being given to the
relationship between stress and disease. As
lifestyles become more stressful, the incidence
of several illnesses that have demonstrated
close links to stress also increases. Although
stress is not a direct cause of disease
and illness, the relationship is too significant
to be only a coincidence. As researchers continue
to examine the association between
stress and disease, more explanations will be
forthcoming.


Psychophysiological disorders are the
underlying cause of the majority of client visits
to internists and family practice physicians.
Because psychological and spiritual components
affect clients' physical symptoms, it is
important that this group of people be treated
in a holistic manner. Many illnesses belong in
this diagnostic category, and this chapter presented
only the most prevalent. The health
care provider needs to remember that there are
multiple causes for the presenting symptoms,
and many of them are directly or indirectly related
to stress in the client's life.
