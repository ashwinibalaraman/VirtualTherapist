<font size="4"><b>Chapter 11: Stress, Coping and Health in Children</b></font>

Stressful situations and attempts to
cope with these experiences have
a direct and observable impact on
psychological, behavioral, and physiological
systems. Therefore, these experiences are of
interest to nursing and other health care professionals.
Effective coping strategies may
help to prevent maladaptive stress responses.
Because lifelong patterns for coping with
stress are begun in childhood, it is important to
understand children's stressors, coping patterns,
outcomes, and the environmental and
individual factors that influence the stress-coping
process (Haggerty, Sherrod, Garmezy,
&amp; Rutter, 1996). For the purpose of this chapter,
a <i>child</i> is generally defined as a person between
the ages of 6 to 18 years, unless otherwise
noted. Extant knowledge about
children's stress-coping processes is derived
primarily from the disciplines of nursing, psychology,
and medicine. This chapter, although
not all-inclusive, is a synthesis of key findings
from these disciplines.


- <b>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</b>


There are no specific models or theories to
explain the entire process of children's stress
and coping; the transactional model developed
for adults (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984),
however, is the theory most commonly applied
to research in children. This dynamic
transactional stress-coping process fits well
within an ecological and growth and developmental
model, which is critical when studying
children. In an ecological model, environmental
and individual characteristics interact
to influence a child's behavior, and like any
systems model, a change in one system (cellular,
individual, family, or community) influences
change in other systems (Bahg, 1990).
The concepts of growth and development are
critical to any model that explains children's
behavior because of the tremendous changes
in cognitive, physical, social, and psychological
status that occur during childhood (Berk,
1997).

A Transactional Model of the Stress-Coping Process (adapted with permission from Lazarus, 1990)</div>

The framework shown in Figure 11.1 is
an adaptation of Lazarus's model of stress and
emotion processes (Lazarus, 1990). Each
child represents a unique combination of individual
and environmental variables. Stressors
result from person-environment interactions,
which cause a child to appraise the situation,
appraise the coping resources that are available
to him or her, and employ a repertoire of
coping behaviors. Short-term effects of the
child's reaction include appraisal of the effectiveness
of coping behavior, psychosocial behavior,
and physiological changes. Long-term
effects are manifested as psychological well-being,
social functioning, and somatic health
or illness. The overall effectiveness of the
stress-coping process places children in a position
of being relatively resistant or vulnerable
to additional stress. The assumption underlying
the model is that the actual stress-coping
process is dynamic and interrelated—
not as simplistic or linear as is reflected in the
model.


Lazarus's (1990) theory has been applied
to children by many researchers, but it has not
specifically been tested for its adequacy with
respect to children. The extent to which research
and theory fit within the model and
support the proposed linkages between concepts
can serve as a beginning for the evaluation
of the logical adequacy of the model
(Walker &amp; Avant, 1988). The key concepts in
the stress-coping process model in Figure
11.1 serve as an outline for this chapter.


- <b>STRESSORS</b>


The literature reveals two major categories of
stressors in children, normative and

[p. <i>267</i>]

Stress in preschool, elementary, junior
high, and high school children was first quantified
by Coddington (1972), who developed
the widely used Life Event Scales (LES) consisting
of 30 to 42 stressful life events. The
events were derived from the literature about
adult coping behavior, the popular Holmes
and Rahe (1967) Social Readjustment Rating
Scale, and the author's experience with children.
The amount of "life change" likely to be
incurred by each stressful event was estimated
by other professionals who worked with children.
"Death of a parent" was assigned the
highest number of "life change units." The
child's total stress score was the sum of life
change units for each stressor experienced in
the past year. Other instruments with items
derived from adults' perspective were developed,
including a revision of the LES (Table
11.1).


Later, new instruments were developed
that included events that children identified as
stressful to them. To obtain stressors for a new
instrument, children were asked to identify
events that were stressful or made them "feel
bad, nervous, or worried" (Lewis, Siegel, &amp;
Lewis, 1984). Children's responses were incorporated
into the 20-item Feel Bad Scale
(FBS). A comparison of the children's list of
stressors with those identified by adults reveals
very few similarities; in fact, there are
only 4 items in common between the LES and
the FBS (Ryan, 1988). School-age children
report that their most frequently occurring
stressors are feeling sick, having nothing to
do, not having enough money to spend, being
pressured to get good grades, and feeling left
out of the group (Lewis et al., 1984). Children
identified more normative, daily events related
to parents, school, peers, and self,
whereas adults tended to list mostly family-related,
nonnormative catastrophic events.
Research designed to examine children's responses
to "life stress" requires instruments
that tap the range of stressors that are most
relevant to children.


Nurses have examined stress related to
illness or hospitalization for many years; most
notably is the classic work by Visintainer and
Wolfer (1975). The stress of separation from
parents has been reduced by more liberal
visiting policies. As medical technology has
advanced, however, so have the potential
sources of stress to children, most notably the
many invasive, frightening, and painful diagnostic
tests and treatments. Children's medical
fears have not changed significantly, however.
When asked, children continue to
identify separation from parents, needle and
other "sticks," being told that something is
wrong with them, and uncertainty (Broome,
Hellier, Wilson, Dale, &amp; Glanville, 1988; Hart
&amp; Bossert, 1994). Table 11.1 presents a detailed
description of many instruments developed
during the past 27 years to measure
stressors in children from preschool age to adolescence.


Most instruments contain different types
of stressors and are specifically designed for
selected age groups. Despite the large number
of instruments available, most were developed
for and tested on largely white, middle-class
children and published more than a decade
ago. Sociopolitical changes have made it
likely that new stressors have arisen, such as
personal safety, community violence, homelessness,
threat of war, AIDS, and increased
availability of drugs to younger children

- <b>APPRAISAL OF
STRESSORS</b>


Lazarus and Folkman (1984) describe the individual's
cognitive appraisal of person-environment
interactions as irrelevant, benign-positive,
or stressful. If the encounter is appraised
as stressful or potentially stressful,
the individual further appraises it as harm or
loss, threat, or challenge. These are not necessarily
mutually exclusive, which further
illustrates the importance of considering the
individual perspective when studying the
stress-coping process. It is this appraisal that
helps to determine the actual effect of the
stressor on the individual. It makes little
sense to ask one individual to appraise or
evaluate "stress" for another.


Two studies illustrate this assertion.
Yamamoto (1979) asked fourth, fifth, and
sixth graders to rate 20 academic and personal
stressors for level of "upsettingness." Then, he
ranked the items from high to low. Seven
items were similar to events on the Coddington

[p. <i>271</i>]

Although most instruments measure the
source of stress, and perhaps the frequency
with which stressors occur, many instruments
fail to measure the appraisal aspect—that is,
they do not ask "how bad is it for you?" Fewer
than half of the instruments listed in Table
11.1 ask children to appraise the degree of
"badness," upsettingness, "desirability," or
"happiness" related to each stressor listed.
Lewis and others (1984) examined the relationship
between badness and frequency with
which stressors occurred. There was a predictable
linear relationship with 10 of the 20 items
on the FBS in that perceived severity increased
as frequency of the stressors increased.
Interestingly, children who had never
experienced them ranked two items, "separation
of parents" and "being pressured to try
something new," highest in badness.


Children's sense of control over a stressor
is part of their appraisal of the stressor. For example,
being witness to parents arguing looms
larger than their own arguments with a playmate.
The issue of control has only recently
received attention in the theoretical and research
literature, but the few studies illustrate
that sense of control over a stressor has an impact
on well-being, coping behavior, and outcomes.
In one study, children who believed
that they had no control over daily stressors
responded with more avoidance behaviors
than did children who perceived some control
(Hardy, Power, &amp; Jaedicke, 1993).


The primary-secondary control model
was tested on a group of children with leukemia.
The model assumes that many medical
stressors are outside of children's control, and
that children adjust their coping behavior accordingly
(Wiesz, McCabe, &amp; Dennig, 1994).
Primary control coping involved attempts to
alter the stressor, whereas secondary control
coping included attempts to adjust oneself to
the stressor or to make no attempt to cope at
all (relinquished control). Children's reports
of their coping strategies revealed that use of
secondary control during painful medical procedures
was associated with better behavioral
and illness-specific adjustment.


The cognitive diathesis-stress model of
depression was studied in 439 children aged
10 or 11 years (Hilsman &amp; Garber, 1995). The
stressor was receipt of unacceptable grades on
a report card with resultant negative parental
reactions to the grade report. The model suggests
that negative thoughts and lack of control
over a stressor are associated with high
levels of depression. In the study, children
who had negative thoughts about their low
grades and felt little control over their grades
experienced depressive symptoms that lasted
for 5 days. Children with more positive
cognitions and a sense of control reported
fewer depressive symptoms and recovered
more rapidly from the stress of unacceptable
grades. They had more confidence in themselves
and believed they could remedy the
poor grades.


Few instruments are available that measure
children's perceptions of control. One exception
is the Student Perceptions of Control
Questionnaire related to academic achievement
developed by E. A. Skinner and colleagues
at the University of Rochester (cited
in Hilsman &amp; Garber, 1995). It would be useful
to identify children's perceptions of control
over their stressors, and, where there is
potential for change in perceptions, clinicians
can help children find ways to regain some
control and thus change maladaptive responses.
Also, examination of the relationships

- <b>APPRAISAL OF COPING
RESOURCES</b>


Once a stressor has been identified and appraised,
individuals appraise coping resources
that are available to manage the
stressor. There is little research to support
whether a large or small repertoire of coping
strategies is best, and there is also little research
on the extent to which a child uses different
strategies in different situations. Lazarus
and Folkman (1984) emphasize that, in
adults, coping behaviors differ according to
whether one is anticipating, experiencing, or
managing the aftermath of a stressor. In one
study, children (ages 8-12 years) were asked
to list ways that they managed stressors before,
during, and after the stressful event to
determine the domain of coping behavior for
future instrument development (Ryan, 1989).
Children were not asked to reveal the specific
stressor they were thinking about, but their
responses suggested that they followed the instructions.
In general, Ryan notes,
<blockquote>
<p>
Anticipation of stressors causes children to
marshal coping strategies which serve to
avoid the situation (isolation, avoidance), to
tackle the situation (cognitive behaviors), or
to seek support from others (social support).
During the stressful event, behaviors
related to social support are still apparent,
cognitive behaviors are most prevalent, and
physical exercise and emotional behaviors
are also frequently identified. After the
stressor, behaviors which help to forget the
stressor, such as distracting behaviors and
avoidant behaviors, are common. Emotional
behaviors, and, for the first time, relaxation
behaviors are frequently identified,
which suggests that built-up tension is released
through use of these strategies.

The Coping Resources Inventory for older
adolescents and adults is the only instrument
found that measures the resources currently
available to manage stressors (i.e., precursors
to stress), as opposed to coping strategies actually
selected and implemented (Hammer,
1988). Additional research is needed to (a) develop
global measures of children's coping resources,
(b) examine the extent to which coping
repertoires expand or contract with age
and experience, (c) determine the relative effectiveness,
and (d) evaluate the relative merits
of a large or small repertoire of coping
strategies.


- <b>COPING BEHAVIOR</b>


Coping behaviors or strategies are "constantly
changing cognitive and behavioral efforts"
to manage stressors (Lazarus &amp;
Folkman, 1984, p. 141). Coping strategies are
inherently neutral; they can be viewed as positive
or negative only in the context of the situation
and outcomes. In other words, "ignore
it" may be the best strategy for a stressor the
child cannot change but is relatively short
lived, such as being ridiculed by a group of
children at summer camp. A pattern of stressful
peer relationships at school, however, is
not a stressor that can be ignored.


Lazarus and Launier's (1978) early work
differentiated between problem-focused and
emotion-focused coping strategies. Problem-focused
strategies are used to manage or
change the stressor, whereas emotion-focused
strategies are used to manage the emotions
generated by the stressor. Implementation of
these definitions is difficult without knowing
the intent behind the strategy—that is, coping
strategies are not inherently problem focused
or emotion focused. For example, "talk to
someone" could be a strategy intended to obtain
advice about how to handle the problem
or to complain bitterly about the problem, and
"think about it" could be to think about ways
to handle the problem or ways to "get even"
with the perpetrators. Most coping instruments
include general strategies similar to
these examples. Inclusion of multiple possibilities
for "intent" behind each strategy

[p. <i>273</i>]

A nonhierarchical taxonomy of children's
coping behaviors was developed from a
synthesis of 16 published research studies of
primarily healthy children (Ryan-Wenger,
1992). All coping strategies mentioned in the
research studies were inductively sorted into
categories, resulting in 15 mutually exclusive
categories. The categories, their definitions,
and examples are shown in Table 11.2.


A similar review of research studies that
focused on coping behavior of children with
acute or chronic illness showed that the same
15 categories of coping strategies were used
(Ryan-Wenger, 1996). The development of instruments
to measure children's coping has
followed a similar pattern as that of measurement
of children's stressors, beginning with
items derived from adults' perspective, literature
on adult coping behavior, or observation
of children. Later, instruments began to include
coping strategies that children say they
use. Table 11.3 lists coping instruments that
have been used in research or clinical practice.


Coping strategies are learned in infancy
and childhood, and many continue into adulthood.
Several cross-sectional studies across
age groups of 8- to 12-year-olds indicate that
older children use cognitive and problem-solving
strategies more often than younger
children in a variety of stressful situations,
which reflects an increased ability to think abstractly
(Altshuler &amp; Ruble, 1989; Band &amp;
Weisz, 1988; Ryan, 1989). Compas (1988),
however, found the opposite trend in use of
problem-solving strategies in a study of 10- to
15-year-old children. Additional research is
needed to determine situations in which problem
solving is used and most appropriate for
children of different ages. A longitudinal
study of 8- to 11-year-olds, who were age 10
to 13 at the second data collection point,
showed no difference in coping frequency
scores over time, but there was a significant
interaction between age and time for coping
effectiveness scores (Sharrer &amp; Ryan-Wenger,
1995). Nine-year-olds had the highest scores
at Time 1, and 12-year-olds had the lowest
scores at Time 2, suggesting that as age increases,
children's perceptions of their coping
effectiveness decrease. Coping strategies can
be taught to children, as evidenced by research
and case studies that focus on teaching
relaxation skills (LaMontagne, Mason, &amp;
Hepworth, 1985), self-regulation by hypnosis
(Sugarman, 1996), and psychoeducational
group training in coping skills (Jones &amp;
Selder, 1996).


In studies of adults and children, the
availability and quality of parental support
play a significant role in the types of coping
strategies used to manage stressors and in
both short- and long-term outcomes of the
stress-coping process. One study showed that
maternal support and a structured parenting
style may play a role in the number of coping
strategies that children use and in the use of
avoidant and aggressive strategies (Hardy et
al., 1993). Unexpectedly, these behaviors
were more evident when mothers provided a
high level of support, defined as behavior that
makes the child feel comfortable, accepted,
and secure (i.e., listening, comforting, and approving
of the child). One explanation for this
finding might be that children who feel secure
and supported tend to avoid or are perhaps not
as concerned about daily stressors that are
perceived as being outside their control. Their
use of aggressive behavior is not as easy to interpret.


Two separate critical reviews of the literature
examined the coping strategies used by
children with acute or chronic illness (Ryan-Wenger,
1996) and the determinants and consequences
of children's coping with painful
medical stressors (Rudolph, Dennig, &amp; Weisz,
1995). Much of the data are inconsistent, suggesting
that additional research is needed, particularly
with regard to differentiating coping
behavior from outcomes. The most commonly
reported coping strategy in many studies was
the use of social support, although most of the
reports did not indicate from whom such support
was sought (Ryan-Wenger, 1996). Other
common coping strategies included stressor
modification, which included taking control
or direct action against the stressor; cognitive

Recent research studies indicated that
avoidant coping behaviors were associated
with poor metabolic control in children with
diabetes (Grey, Lipman, Cameron, &amp; Thurber,
1997). Coping strategies used by children
with chronic illnesses are similar to strategies
they use to deal with non-illness-related
stressors (Spirito, Stark, Gil, &amp; Tyc, 1995),
and even during repeated hospitalizations
they are relatively stable (Boyd &amp; Hunsberger,
1998). No longitudinal, prospective
studies were found that had examined the
mechanisms by which coping strategies are

- <b>PERSON AND ENVIRONMENTAL
FACTORS</b>


A variety of individual and environmental
factors play a role in determining the stress-coping
process and outcomes, and it is outside
the scope of this chapter to describe them
all. These factors include age, gender, socioeconomic
status, parental support, health status,
and personality characteristics. One factor
that will be briefly reviewed is the child's
coping style.


An individual's repertoire of coping strategies
is probably partially determined by his
or her's coping style, which is not to be confused
with coping behavior. Coping style, or
temperament, is a relatively stable personality
characteristic that typifies one's style of
managing person-environment interactions
(Thomas &amp; Chess, 1984). Coping styles are
usually described in unidimensional, dichotomous
terms, such as monitors versus blunters
(Miller, 1989), avoidant versus vigilant (Cohen
&amp; Lazarus, 1973), or internalizers versus
externalizers (Boyd &amp; Johnson, 1981). Temperament
is usually defined in terms of nine
characteristic ways of responding to one's environment:
activity, rhythmicity, approach or
withdrawal, adaptability, threshold of responsiveness,
intensity of reaction, mood, distractibility,
and persistence. Difficult infants
tend to have biological irregularity, withdrawal,
slow adaptability, and negative reactions
of high intensity (Chess, 1990). Difficult
school-aged children are those with low
adaptability and negative mood (Hegvik,
McDevitt, &amp; Carey, 1982).


Research that will be reviewed in the following
sections tends to focus either on children's
coping strategies and outcomes or on
coping styles and outcomes. Little is known,
however, about how coping strategies, styles,
and outcomes interact. Clinicians who desire
to help children acquire more effective coping
strategies would probably benefit by examining
the compatibility of new coping strategies
with the child's inherent coping style. To advance
theory about the origin and maintenance
of coping strategies, and inform practice,
it is essential to study the contribution of
coping style to this process. There are many
instruments that have been developed to measure
coping styles for children of all ages, as
shown in Table 11.4.


- <b>SHORT-TERM RESPONSES IN
THE STRESS-COPING PROCESS</b>


<b><i>Appraisal of Coping Effectiveness</i></b>


Children are capable of evaluating the effectiveness
of their coping strategies (Ryan-Wenger,
1990). Little is known, however,
about many aspects of children's appraisal of
coping effectiveness, including when and how
often this appraisal occurs, the criteria that
they use to define "effectiveness," how these
differ from adults' definitions of effectiveness,
or how children alter their coping behaviors
based on periodic appraisal of their effectiveness.
The theoretical model shown in Figure
11.1 suggests that the relative effectiveness of
coping strategies influences psychological behavior,
social functioning, and somatic health
outcomes of stressful person-environment interactions.
To date, little empirical research
has adequately tested this proposition.


<i><b>Psychosocial Behavior</b></i>


One outcome of the stress-coping process
is a change in affect and social behavior (Lazarus,
1990). Sometimes, these changes are
short lived and are viewed as the normal "ups
and downs" of childhood and adolescence. A

[p. <i>279</i>]

Advances in health technology, medical
management, and nursing care have dramatically
increased survival rates and decreased
mortality for children suffering from chronic
disease and disability. At the same time, ethical
questions have been raised about such
medical interventions with respect to the
stress of chronic illness and the impact on
quality of life, especially social adaptation,
growth and development, and cognitive functioning
(Blakeney et al., 1998; Bloom,
Wright, Morris, Campbell, &amp; Krawiecki,
1997).


Children respond to the stress of their
own illnesses in a variety of ways. Canning,
Canning, and Boyce (1992) discovered that
children with chronic illness reported fewer or
similar depressive symptoms when compared
to a group of healthy controls. It was hypothesized
that ill children cope by using denial and
repression, reporting lower levels of distress
and anxiety. The children were also found to
be highly defensive. The researchers concluded
that a repressive style of coping may
be a protection against psychological distress,
at least temporarily, and that denial of illness
and defensiveness may protect children
against severe depression.


When a parent has cancer, the gender of
the ill parent and the gender of the child moderate
stress responses (Compas et al., 1994).
Adolescent girls responded with increased
anxiety and depression when their mothers
were diagnosed with cancer. Grant and
Compas (1995) studied this situation further
and found that teenage girls reported greater
stress related to increasing family responsibilities.
The hypothesis that adolescent girls may
use ineffective coping strategies was not supported,
and in fact adolescent girls successfully
used distraction as a method of coping
with their mothers' illnesses by engaging in
household tasks and family responsibilities.
Although more tasks and responsibilities enhanced
reported stress, they also provided a
mechanism for effective coping.


<b><i>Physiologic Changes</i></b>


In infants and children, as well as adults,
experiences of stressful situations and attempts
to cope with stressors have a direct and
observable impact on physiological systems.
Physiologically, stressful experiences activate
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical
(HPA) system (Gunnar, 1998). The HPA system
enhances stress resistance by increasing
energy needed to cope and by modulating
other body systems that are sensitive to stress
including emotions. Studies of laboratory-induced
stress provide useful data for studies of
the physiologic impact of real-life stressors on
children.


Three related laboratory studies were
conducted to examine relationships among
cardiovascular responsivity to laboratory-induced
stress, age, ethnicity, gender, and family
history of cardiovascular (CV) disease (Allen
&amp; Mathews, 1997; Malpass et al., 1997;
Musante, Treiber, Davis, Levy, &amp; Strong,

Recent research has focused on the measurement
of cortisol in response to stressful
stimuli. Cortisol is a key hormone produced in
response to physiological and psychosocial
stressors (Mason, 1968; Seyle, 1976). Salivary
cortisol is a reliable and valid measure of
unbound plasma cortisol and therefore of
adrenocortical reactivity (Laudat et al., 1988).
Cortisol increases during various physical and
emotional stressors, and measurements of salivary
cortisol have frequently been used to determine
the effects of the stress response on
the health of children. For example, Flinn and
England (1997) investigated the relationships
among socioeconomic conditions, family, environment,
stress, and health in a rural Caribbean
village. Longitudinal monitoring of
cortisol in this natural environment was used
to identify specific psychosocial antecedents
and consequences of childhood stress. The
physiological stress response was assessed by
salivary cortisol levels in children age 2
months to 18 years (N = 22,438). Elevated
cortisol levels were not always associated
with traumatic or negative events. Eating
meals, difficult physical work, basketball, and
the return of a family member who was temporarily
absent were associated with temporary
moderate increases (10%-100%) in
cortisol levels. High-stress events (cortisol increases
from 100% to 2000%), however, were
associated with family trauma, conflict, or
change. Punishment, quarreling, and residence
change substantially increased cortisol
levels.


- <b>LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE
STRESS-COPING PROCESS</b>


Some children develop frequent or exaggerated
psychological symptoms, illnesses,
social isolation, or other long-term manifestations
of the internalization of stress. Some
commonly used instruments to measure
these long-term outcomes are listed in Table
11.5.


<b><i>Psychological Well-Being
and Social Functioning</i></b>


Normative stressors for school-age children
frequently involve peer problems and academic
failures. Repetti (1996) investigated
the stress of perceived academic and social
failures at school and found that children reported
their own behaviors as more demanding
and aversive toward parents. Much of this
behavior represented attempts to secure parental
attention and gain reassurance after
problems occurred in school. Children under
stress of school failures were also more prone
to behave aversively with mothers than with
fathers. There is evidence that children make

[p. <i>283</i>]

In contrast, Campbell, Pierce, Moore,
Marakovitz, and Newby (1996) investigated
boys exhibiting behavior problems starting at
age 4 and followed them to ages 6 and 9 (<i>N</i> =
102). Externalizing problems included aggression
toward peers, noncompliance, over-activity,
and lack of impulse control. These
behaviors were associated with concurrent
family stress, particularly negative maternal
control. As the boys grew older, they continued
to report receiving negative discipline and
were exposed to chronic family stress characterized
by negative life events, marital dissatisfaction,
and maternal depression.


Behavior during a "strange situation"
(maternal separation and a strange adult female
who comforts the infant if he or she becomes
distressed) revealed attachment classifications
for thirty-eight 19-month-old
infants (Hertsgaard, Gunnarm, Erickson, &amp;
Nachmias, 1995). This study provides support
that disorganized attachment behavior (Type
D attachment) reflects a vulnerability to
stressful stimulation. Type D attachments are
expected to occur most often in infants who
are at risk for poor parenting or whose lives
are characterized by a high degree of familial
stress (Carlson, Cicchetti, Barnett, &amp;
Braunwald, 1989). The results may be a reflection
of the lack of an organized set of attachment-related
coping responses. The researchers
postulate that the vulnerability of
this particular group of infants to stress may
result in disorders related to their social and
emotional development.


Steward (1998) hypothesized that for
some infants who live in a chaotic or non-nurturing
environment, overuse of the normal
conservation-withdrawal coping mechanism
(shutdown of reaction to the environment) results
in decreased demand for attention,
underfeeding, and a decreased growth rate.
Although the coping behavior is effective in
dealing with the stressful environment, it
may be related to the development of non-organic
failure to thrive (NOFTT) syndrome.
Steward supports this hypothesis with research
findings indicating that infants with
NOFTT sleep more, are more difficult, and
are less responsive to their environments
than healthy infants. Prospective studies are
needed, however, to determine whether these
characteristics develop before, during, or after
growth failure reaches a level at which the diagnosis
of NOFTT is made.


Finally, posttraumatic stress syndrome
and other psychosocial problems are receiving
attention related to traumatic experiences,
such as having cancer, severe burns, child
abuse, or witnessing the ravages of war.
Children who survive cancer may have difficulty
with intellectual, academic, emotional,
adaptive, and social functioning (Morris,
Krawiecki, Wright, &amp; Walter, 1993). Twenty-five
children between the ages of 2 and 25
years were followed, and the majority showed
low average to deficient levels of performance
on neuropsychologic achievement and adaptive
behavior measurements. Duration of cancer
and medical risk scores significantly correlated
with decreased functioning. Behavior
problems were not often observed in these
children, although several demonstrated characteristics
of hyperactivity. The extent to
which these changes are due to stress versus
the long-term effects of chemotherapy treatment
is not known.


Psychosocial adjustment in survivors of
massive pediatric bum injuries was examined
as part of a longitudinal study initiated in
1986 (Blakeney et al., 1998). These young
burn victims were mildly diminished in academic
and social competence, but the majority
were adapting satisfactorily and the children
appeared to have no more behavioral
problems than those reported in an age-matched
healthy control group. Burned children
also reported positive self-esteem. Decreased
activity competence, as in athletic
sports, was associated only with the level of

HPA axis disturbance was evaluated via
blood samples for corticotropin (ACTH) and
cortisol in 13 depressed and nonabused children,
13 normal control children, and 13 depressed
and abused children (Kaufman et al.,
1997). Although a blunting effect was expected,
the depressed and abused children
(when compared to the depressed and
nonabused and normal control children) had a
significantly augmented ACTH response to
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) challenge.
All children who were in the high responder
groups were found to be currently living
in homes in which there was ongoing
emotional maltreatment (chronic ongoing adversity),
whereas all low responders were not.
The abused children that showed blunted
ACTH secretion post-CRH were living in relatively
stable environments. Results indicate
that experiences of abuse in combination with
ongoing stressors and an absence of positive
supports promote significant dysregulation
of the HPA axis system. Although HPA activity
is adaptive in the short term, prolonged
stress and concomitant prolonged HPA activity
leave the infant or child physiologically
and psychologically vulnerable (Gunnar,
1992). Findings also suggest that it may not be
the chronicity of stress exposure but rather
the developmental timing of exposure that is
critical in determining the long-term consequences.


<b><i>Somatic Health and Illness</i></b>


Numerous studies summarized by Boyce
and others indicate that consistently, and
across settings, a small portion (15%-20%) of
the child population accounts for most of the
school absentee rate, more than half of the
morbidity, and half of the health services utilization
of that population (Boyce, 1992;
Kornguth, 1990; Weitzman, Walker, &amp;
Gortmaker, 1986). Children with chronic illnesses
or disabilities account for only approximately
5%; the remainder comprises children
with frequent and various physical and psychological
morbidity conditions. One longitudinal
study showed that the same childhood
patterns of illness and health services utilization
persist into adulthood (Lewis &amp; Lewis,
1989). Some hypothesized determinants of
frequent illnesses are parental anxiety regarding
the child's health, constitutional vulnerability
to stress (illness-prone), or internalization
of stress (Boyce, 1992). Research on
children with frequent illnesses, frequent absence
from school due to illness, and frequent
use of health services is needed to examine
their relationships to coping behavior.


Drummond and Hewson-Bower (1997)
investigated the association between psychosocial
stress and susceptibility to upper respiratory
tract infections. This relationship was
demonstrated through measurement of the
concentration of secretory immunoglobulin A
(sIgA) and its ratio to albumin in saliva in 45
children with a history of recurrent colds and
flu and in 45 healthy children. The purpose
was to investigate the differences between ill
and healthy children in terms of their degree
of life events stress and their personality and
mood profiles. Secretory IgA is regarded as a
first line of defense against the invasion of antigens
into the lining of the upper respiratory
tract (Ahl &amp; Reinholdt, 1991; Bienenstock,
Croitoru, Ernst, &amp; Stanisz, 1989; Borysenko,
1987). High preinfection levels of sIgA correlate
well with protection against viral infection
(Isaacs, Webster, &amp; Valman, 1984;
Rossen et al., 1970). Results indicated a lower

[p. <i>287</i>]

Immune changes of children experiencing
the normative stressor of entering kindergarten
were the focus of another study (Boyce
et al., 1995). Adrenocortical and behavioral
predictors of immune responses were measured
by salivary cortisol level, quantitative
counts of T cell subsets, and behavioral difficulty
with school adjustment (<i>N</i> = 39). Findings
supported previous studies (Gunnar,
Mangelsdorf, Larson, &amp; Hertsgaard, 1989;
Larson, Gunnar, &amp; Hertsgard, 1991; Lewis &amp;
Thomas, 1990) with a moderate increase in
salivary cortisol in response to low-level psychologic
stress. Immunologic function exhibited
a modest increase in cell numbers and
diminution in function, although all scores remained
within the realm of normal ranges for
children of this age.


A surprising finding was that children of
more highly educated mothers showed greater
adrenodcortical activation and larger increases
in T cell subsets than those peers with
mothers who were less educated. The researchers
postulated that there may be greater
expectation placed on children of more highly
educated parents. Parent-reported behavioral
difficulties and adrenocortical responses to
school entry were associated with alterations
in both enumeration and functional measures
of immune status. The results suggest that behavioral
and adrenocortical responses may be
associated with different profiles of immunological
effects that influence susceptibility to
immune-mediated disease. Previous research
suggests that individual differences in temperament,
sociocultural environment, and psychosocial
factors influence the coping and adaptive
capacity of the child.


- <b>STRESS RESISTANCE AND
STRESS VULNERABILITY</b>


Research in the area of stress and coping in
children has focused as much on positive as
on negative outcomes. Some research concerns
a special subset of "resilient" children
who have experienced many unusually severe
stressors and yet function exceptionally well
despite the great odds against them (Masten,
Best, &amp; Garmezy, 1990). The majority of research
concerns a different and larger group
of resilient or stress-resistant children who
come from a variety of environments and
manage stressors of varying frequency and
severity without unusual physical or
psychosocial problems. This type of sustained
competence is a capacity that develops
over time in the context of person-environment
interactions (Masten &amp; Coatsworth,
1998). Other children appear to be more vulnerable
to stressful situations and environments.
Stress vulnerability is defined as a
"condition of unusual or exaggerated susceptibility
to the environmental agents of disease
or disorder, including psychosocial stressors"
(Boyce, 1992, p. 4).


Many children conduct their daily lives in
a socially and behaviorally competent manner
at home and at school despite the presence
of family stressors. Smith and Prior (1995)
operationally defined this competence as
"child stress resilience." Attributes of child
temperament, self-esteem, ability, gender, and
mother-child warmth were studied in relation
to family stress involving poverty, family discord,
and stressful life events. Although age,
gender, ability, and self-concept were not significant
for adaptation, positive temperament,
lower levels of maternal stress, and a warm
maternal-child relationship predicted more
adaptive responses to stress. Phipps and Mulhern
(1995) were interested in the stress resilience
of children undergoing bone marrow

[p. <i>288</i>]

We argue that "ineffective coping strategies"
contribute to internalization of stress. In
his work with adults, Lazarus stated that the
ways that people cope with stress are probably
more directly related to health and illness than
are the frequency and severity of stressors
(Lazarus &amp; Launier, 1978). Studies have
shown that children with a history of recurrent
abdominal pain or other stress-related symptoms
used less effective coping strategies or
had significantly lower coping effectiveness
scores than children with no stress-related
symptoms (Ryan-Wenger, 1990). The effectiveness
(and social acceptability) of children's
coping strategies may determine the
extent to which children are vulnerable or resilient
to current and future stressful situations.
Even successful coping takes a psychological
toll on children; therefore, it is
important to examine the amount of coping
children have to do over time (Emery &amp;
Coiro, 1997). It may be that although emotional
regulation buffers against certain stressors,
it also increases vulnerability to others,
and successful coping in one realm may not
be indicative of positive coping and overall
psychological well-being (Thompson &amp;
Calkins, 1996).


It is important to identify factors that
cause children to be resistant to stress. It is
tempting to assume that protective factors are
simply the opposite of risk factors, and that
stress resistance and vulnerability are opposite
poles of a single dimension. In the absence
of a body of research to support either
assumption, Rutter (1996) suggests that in the
search for causality, stress resistance and
stress vulnerability should be treated as separate
constructs, and that exploration of causal
factors include physical, psychological, social,
and environmental variables.


- <b>IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH,
THEORY DEVELOPMENT, AND
PRACTICE</b>


What is known about stress and coping in
children was generated from the perspective
of several disciplines, and typically new research
in each discipline is informed by a
synthesis of this knowledge. Because the
stress-coping process influences a child's
psychological, behavioral, and physiological
systems simultaneously, more research
should be interdisciplinary, in which the
problem, design, method, and interpretation
of findings are approached from multiple perspectives.
More research is needed to understand
children's appraisal of stressors and
coping resources; children's motivations for
selecting coping strategies; linkages between
stressors, coping behavior, and outcomes;
and interventions to decrease vulnerability or
increase children's stress resistance.


Stress-coping theories developed specifically
for children are overdue. Although researchers
have typically applied theories that
explain adult stress and coping behavior to research
and practice with children, children's
cognitive, physical, and social realities are
dramatically different from those of adults. If
one accepts that appraisal plays a significant
role in the stress-coping process, then theories
are needed to explain differences in appraisal
as children move through stages of cognitive
development. Children's stressors are not the
same as adults' stressors, nor is their level of
control over stressors the same. Theories
should account for sources of stress such as
height, weight, appearance, and agility, which
are of extreme importance to children and adolescents
when peer acceptance begins to take
priority over family relationships or relationships
with significant others. It may be helpful
to begin by comprehensively analyzing and

[p. <i>289</i>]

Nurses and other health care providers
should always consider potential interactions
among stress, coping, health, and illness. Include
in history-taking the sources of stress
and typical coping strategies from the child's
and the parents' perspectives. Children can be
taught new coping strategies in individual or
group settings. Helping children relate specific
coping strategies to desirable and undesirable
outcomes may be the first step in assisting
children to manage their own stress-related
responses. Scholars interested in children's
stress-coping processes will want more
in-depth discussion than could be provided in
this chapter. Additional work by the following
authors with programs of research in this area
should be examined: J. Austin, M. Grey,
M. Hockenberry-Eaton, L. LaMontagne,
N. Ryan-Wenger, and R. C. Yeaworth in nursing;
B. Compas, A. Spirito, W. T. Boyce, and
N. Garmezy in psychotogy; and C. Lewis,
M. Masten, L. Peterson, and M. Rutter in
medicine.
