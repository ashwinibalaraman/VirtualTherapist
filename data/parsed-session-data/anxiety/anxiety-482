BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So how have you been?
<b>PT:</b> I've been good.
<b>DR:</b> Good, good, what's new in your life, anything?
<b>PT:</b> Ah, I've been involved in another landmark course.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> This is another kind of a, you know, you kind of evolve through the courses and I've been taking another one that's another year long course, called a partnership course, it's more of kind of an exploration farther into, ah, the community and your place in the world and that kind of thing.
<b>DR:</b> Are you liking it?
<b>PT:</b> I'm liking it, yeah, I've kind of, I've kind of, ah, gone back and forth.  I was kind of resigned in being rebellious the last time.  I decided I didn't like the instructor and stuff like that, then for some reason, this weekend I just had it this weekend and I kind of enjoyed it.
<b>DR:</b> The same instructor or a different one?
<b>PT:</b> The same instructor.
<b>DR:</b> Huh, it just felt different?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it felt different.  I think, you know, it was me maybe being a little rebellious about the thing.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, and who knows why and - 
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes things just rub us different ways at different times.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly.
<b>DR:</b> Well good, so are you still involved or is the course finished?
<b>PT:</b> No, the course has got 2 more weekends
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It goes to like mid March.
<b>DR:</b> And do you go up to Denver for it?
<b>PT:</b> No, it's Los Angelos.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> That's the one place in the world that they do it 
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> 350 to 400 people
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, and two more weekends over what period of time, once a month or
<b>PT:</b> It's about every month and a half
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well good, so you feel like you're getting some good things out of it
<b>PT:</b> I get some good things out of it.
<b>DR:</b> Excellent and is your wife going too or is she - 
<b>PT:</b> No, because you know, I think she actually has taken it before so she would do what they call, you know, just ghost, being there and she's already done it and we have the, it's tough with the - 
<b>DR:</b> With the kids.
<b>PT:</b> With the kids and stuff like that. It wasn't so bad when Denver was the weekends and that kind of thing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But it's difficult with and it gets expensive too after a couple of times.
<b>DR:</b> I'm sure, yeah, well good, so it sounds like you've got some interests ongoing, good.  Been doing anything else for fun?
<b>PT:</b> I've been doing mountain biking.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Fortunately, it hasn't been like last year where this time of year we got the snowstorms and it was impossible to bike.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so you're still up in the hills?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean it gets a little chilly in the shade sometimes but - 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So far it's been dry so.
<b>DR:</b> Good, no accidents or problems?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Not more than typical falls.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, no serious falls, good, so how have your spirits been overall?
<b>PT:</b> They've been pretty good, you know, I mean the typical kind of up and down.  I had noticed that I had been through some more, ah, moody streaks of late but I may have just kind of been noticing them, being more aware of them maybe is the proper term.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so not necessarily more extreme highs or lows just maybe more awareness, is that what you feel?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, more awareness maybe -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And maybe, I don't think the highs have, you know, since Depakote, the highs have never really been like they had been before.  My F, what was it, the F-15 I used to call it at one time.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Those have always, ah, been pretty mild.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I actually maybe aware but I have to say that maybe the, these moody periods of the lows are a little bit lower than usual.  Maybe the time of year or the occurrences going on in my life or something else.
<b>DR:</b> Sure, the lows, when you go through those down periods, how long do they last, hours, days, weeks?
<b>PT:</b> Um, usually a couple days.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and are you able to kind of push through them in terms of still functioning at work okay?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think they're just kind of more of a moodiness that I notice but I still think I'm just more attuned and aware of, ah, my mood.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Which that makes me, ah, you know, aware of how I am acting and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that sounds good.  Are you sleeping pretty well these days?
<b>PT:</b> I'm sleeping pretty good.  I had some times there that I wasn't sleeping well and then I've gone back to sleeping a little better.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you're not having trouble getting to sleep?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Of course my son has been fidgety and doesn't want to sleep anymore by himself so he comes in our bed.
<b>DR:</b> How old is he now?
<b>PT:</b> 3 1/2 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's a tough age.
<b>PT:</b> He likes thrashes and slaps me.  I'm ready to go sleep downstairs.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they don't sleep very calmly at that age, do they?
<b>PT:</b> My daughter is back.  She's 5 1/2, she sleeps like a log.  She comes to bed, I'm like who cares.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, some kids are just tossers and turners.  How's your energy level during the day, do you feel like you have enough?
<b>PT:</b> It's very good.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  It looks like you're staying in great shape, weight pretty stable?
<b>PT:</b> Weight's pretty stable.  I had, ah, just before the, September I had, ah, got some kind of a viral thing that, you know, first we thought it might have been Rocky Mountain, not Rocky Mountain but what's the one with the - 
<b>DR:</b> Lyme.
<b>PT:</b> Not Lyme, from the mosquitos.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, the West Nile.
<b>PT:</b> They thought it might have been West Nile, it was that kind of viral thing.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> I'd get better and I'd get worse, I'd get better, I'd get worse and so during that period of time I didn't eat very much so it was like a couple of weeks, I had to keep [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] thank goodness.
<b>PT:</b> No, they could never figure out what it was.  They did all the blood tests and uh -
<b>DR:</b> And it hasn't come back.
<b>PT:</b> It hasn't come back, thank goodness.
<b>DR:</b> Good, good, and how's your weight now, how much are you weighing?
<b>PT:</b> It's a little bit low, it's probably, I'm probably down at 150, flat 150 which is - 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, a few pounds under my, I usually stay at the low 150's.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and how tall are you [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> 5'9"
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Probably with all your biking, you're just staying in real good shape
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's probably why you haven't - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, the aerobics kind of burns off stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, your appetite is okay?
<b>PT:</b> Appetite is good.
<b>DR:</b> Good, okay, and how's work going?
<b>PT:</b> Works been good.  It's been kind of evolving back and forth, you know, we're still kind of, you know, I fought, ah, you know, going into the hourly scheme and those kind of things.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But, ah, these have kind of calmed down.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> I think the kind of stuff that I like to do at work, which you know, we have a certain set of, you know, this is what your roles are, you know, and I always try to do these extra little things, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And my boss has slowly been knowing through some stuff I've been doing and other issues I'm doing that, hey this stuff that he does is really valuable and he likes it so maybe we can slowly evolve that as a role.
<b>DR:</b> Well, good.
<b>PT:</b> Which is nice and uh - 
<b>DR:</b> So more of the things you enjoy doing
<b>PT:</b> And it makes me happy and it helps the group
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> You know, it's hard because you can't just say okay here's your role because, you know, that role I'm doing now is lost and you can't really replace it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well at least you survived some lay offs, some rounds of lay offs too.  Does it seem like things are relatively stable now?
<b>PT:</b> Relatively stable, you know, as much as the industry could be.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay, and you've been there how long now?
<b>PT:</b> Eleven years.
<b>DR:</b> Wow, that's pretty good.  These days a lot of people don't make it anywhere eleven years, so.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And you're at a manager level now.
<b>PT:</b> I'm actually kind of a, what they actually, I'm a technical, I'm a technical ladder sort of.  I'm actually at, kind of where my boss is a director.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm actually at her level as far as a manager, you know, the same position levels, you know, but if she's off, you know, there's management tiers and the technical tiers, I'm the technical tiers.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And topped out.
<b>DR:</b> Okay but are you happy where you're at?  Good.  I know someone else that went into a management position and really didn't like it and wanted to go back to doing more technical work and they were much happier doing that.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So then you don't have all the personality issues to deal with, they just have to do what they love doing, so, good, and you're able to focus well when you're at work?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Good, excellent.  Any anxiety that you think is out of the ordinary for circumstances.  
<b>PT:</b> I think when, again going back to when I was in kind of those moody kind of low things, I was really, had some terrible anxiety going on that was, ah, I'm not sure if it was, ah, exemplified by having the little bit lower lows, I'm not sure.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But that was kind of tough there for a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And it was like, you know, things kind of became overwhelming and uh - 
<b>DR:</b> Had you missed any medications during that time do you think?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you're still taking them regularly.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and I keep always forgetting to get my tests to see what my levels are and stuff but.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You haven't changed anything too much, I just think, you know, I think that's just the way, how things go sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.  Yeah, we all have ups and downs or things can effect us, we're not always aware of what they are.  It sounds like you're enjoying yourself, you're out doing things like mountain biking or with the kids.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  So your kids are 4 1/2. 
<b>PT:</b> 3 1/2 and 5 1/2
<b>DR:</b> 5 1/2 and 3 .1/2
<b>PT:</b> So she's kindergarten and he's, well obviously not kindergarten
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so he'll start, not this next year but the year after that
<b>PT:</b> Right?
<b>DR:</b> Okay and where's your daughter going to kindergarten?
<b>PT:</b> DiVinci.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, does she like it?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, it's a great school.  It's very, I think it's really good, it's very art oriented, very kid oriented, it's really a really cool school.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, we had some friends that moved from up here to down there just to go to that school because they it was so good.  Good, good, good, any problems with the Depakote at all?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and do you still use the Sonata or not anymore?
<b>PT:</b> I do, I do occasionally, you know, when I have problems sleeping, just to kind of take off the edge and help me fall asleep.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, does it work when you use it still?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you think you use it once a week on average, once a month?
<b>PT:</b> I'd say once every couple weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes when I, you know, I think I get a little more hyper, I get a little more manic, you know, and maybe take it on occasion but, you know, on average it's probably every couple weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and that's fine.  Yeah and that's just the way to use it, when you need it just to kind of help you to sleep because sleep is so critical.  How much sleep do you think you're getting a night on the average?
<b>PT:</b> That's a good one, you know, it's been difficult because, you know, I'm on that early shift, they make me, kind of work, I work a 7 to 4.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> That's my shift and it's definitely not my biologic clock, I'm a, I used to work 10 to 7 which, you know, sometimes it's kind of nice to get up early and go mountain biking.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> My biologic clock really likes 10 to 7.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so it's tough to get up and get going?
<b>PT:</b> It is, it's very much, it's a fight and I have to force myself to go to bed and I think I, I don't think I get as much sleep as it's probably beneficial for myself but it's, like I fight my clock that I can't do much about.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so what time do you go to sleep typically on a work night?
<b>PT:</b> Probably 11 to 12:30.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and you wake up at what time?
<b>PT:</b> About 6.
<b>DR:</b> So you're getting 5 1/2 to 7 hours, something like 6 to 7 hours sleep maybe?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Does that feel like enough or is that?
<b>PT:</b> No, it doesn't feel like enough.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'd say on average, I probably get about 6 hours, 5 1/2 to 6 hours sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah, that's a little on the low side for most people.  Most would struggle to keep going and get worn out.  What about stresses besides kids crawling into bed, any major stresses in life right now?
<b>PT:</b> I think we had that, you know, some things I need to work out with my wife, you know, she's doing a lot of the landmark stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Volunteer things and, ah, I think there's a lot of, you know, my typical way to deal with confrontation and issues like that is to become resigned.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I just have to, you know, talk to her about it and, of course, it's funny, she's a, she's a very, in this whole scheme of things, she's very educated on, you know, issues, get off it, you know, get your rackets, you know, all these things, you know, we tend to kind of get ourselves into that keep you from being down and, you know, wasting, wasting your life.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> You know, it's silly, like you know you realize you're human, that's what you are.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And she's usually pretty good but honestly she's human and sometimes she's got people who are kind of, she gets coached by.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Who are even more educated kind of in picking up things and working with people and so the other day she kind of came to me and finally said exactly that, she goes hey I realize, you know, you do a lot around the house, more than you really need to.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> And it's because of, you know, the landmark I know you are resigned because, you know, she picks it up.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> So there's some things we get to work out.  I need to kind of say what I need to say and stop being kind of resigned because that just doesn't work, I just - 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It's wasteful being a victim because it doesn't get you anywhere.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so it sounds like kind of natural normal kind of issues that any couple would have, trying to just find balances and work things out and it sounds like overall you guys are doing a good job of that.
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Any other major stresses right now?
<b>PT:</b> No, you know, work is work and, ah, I'd always like to be a millionaire but otherwise it's been fine, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> The kids are kids and stuff like that and uh - 
<b>DR:</b> Well, good.  Speaking of being a millionaire, I read an interesting article recently about a guy who is a millionaire out in Silicone Valley.  He's got like a million dollar house and a three million dollar retirement fund and he's still working like 18 hours, 16 to 18 hour days and they asked him why.  He said well I don't know for sure.  He said I've got to keep going.  He's like 35 to 40 years old, the guy's, you know, just made it and they were talking about how we get, in this country, in this culture, we get on treadmills- 
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And it's just never enough, we just keep going and going and even when people seem like they have the financial means to slow down, they just don't and they were talking in the article about how it's important for us to learn how to slow down and enjoy life wherever we're at on that treadmill and it sounds like you do a pretty good job of that [PATIENT NAME], you're out mountain biking, you do different things, so.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, like I said, you know, I think it's interesting; you wrap it with someone I talked about this weekend.  There's really, they kind of did, I shouldn't say studies because they're always kind of weird, but they found something interesting that the only time they've ever found people really happy with their money -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Is when they go from poverty to being to, ah, self, sufficient.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And that cross over is when somebody is just delightfully happy with how much money they make.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And then from then on, things get worse but going from poverty to delightful, people are like really happy because it's like wow, this is great.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And that's probably the people, people that are down at the just above the kind of poverty thing - 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> Are sometimes the most, like you tend to find sometimes, not so much in this country but like third world countries.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> Who are just kind of living on the edge of poverty and are really happy because they don't have the whole materialistic thing kind of attached.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> And we kind of, [NAME OTHER] how many billion dollars, he, he, if you asked him do you have enough money, no, are you happy with how much money you have, no.
<b>DR:</b> It's crazy isn't it, it's a strange, a strange mentality that we have about it.  We were down in South America this summer and it always amazes, we've been down there a couple times, it always amazes me how happy the people are -
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.
<b>DR:</b> Who are like you said, just on the edge, they don't have much at all but they make enough to support their families, enough, they grow enough food to support their families, not much more, but they're so much happier.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And it's shocking.
<b>PT:</b> I noticed that in Ecuador when I was there, the same circumstances
<b>DR:</b> That's where we were, yeah, Ecuador, yeah.  Where did you go in Ecuador again?
<b>PT:</b> Well we left [INAUDIBLE] and then we went up north to a lot of the rivers.  I was kayaking down there and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, especially after you get out of the big city which is.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, and also I remember in a TV story, a TV program I saw but [NAME OTHER] was interviewing people that won the Lotto, was asking them are you happier now and it was interesting that all of them said no.  They said initially it was fun to go out and buy cars and clothes.  They said after a while, years later, they said they're not any happier than they were before, it's just interesting.
<b>PT:</b> There's like huge divorces levels too, I know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> People end up dying and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's really very stressful for a lot of people.
<b>PT:</b> I guess it incredibly rare for the, ah, Lotto people or Powerball, whatever you win, to actually be happy.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's a nice fantasy that people enjoy but in reality is it doesn't always work.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So it sounds like you're doing well.  Any concerns or problems that I didn't ask you about?
<b>PT:</b> No, I think, you know, if I had sat down with you, if you factor in that kind of moody period, it would have been a lot more, you know, because there was, like I said, some heavy anxiety going on there but, you know, that's, again, it's that ebb and flow.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, it sounds like it probably is part of that ebb and flow of life and probably nothing to be concerned about, especially since it didn't stick around.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> If it lasted, you know, a week or 2, then sometimes it's worth looking at, do we need to do anything about it because we don't want you to keep slipping downward.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But you didn't, you sound like you managed it well, so, well good, well let's keep doing what we're doing then.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Let me check on refills for you.  I did a years' worth of refills on the Depakote in October so we're good there.  Sonata, in September, I did 6 months worth so we're good there until next spring at least.
<b>PT:</b> And if I have an issue, I think, you know, I've been doing it on line with the Medco, you know - 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> If I ever forget and something happens, they just pay them anyway, so - 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they send me a fax which is fine.  I fax them back and that takes care of it. Yeah, if you ever run into a problem, let me know.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> This time I got the fax, like on the last sheet of my fax paper because it has the green stripes.  Sometimes they fax and if I ran out it wouldn't have gone through or something.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So that can happen but so far, so good, and then do you want to go ahead and let me give you a lab slip for the labs again.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, why don't you give me a new one.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> And I'll come in and try to get a little better on my system management time scales.
<b>DR:</b> Well even, I was thinking what else would make it easier for you.  Do you go in for like an annual physical?
<b>PT:</b> I need to again, I haven't been, I thought it after I had my blood tests for my, the viral thing, I should have just had them throw in the, you know, the Depakote level.
<b>DR:</b> I was going to say, if you ever go in for something like that, you could just piggyback it on something else.
<b>PT:</b> But it's time for my yearly, yearly check for, all that stuff when you get to be 50
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's good to check it.  Let's see when we last did liver tests, it was.
<b>PT:</b> It was a long time ago.
<b>DR:</b> It has been, so probably worth checking again just to make sure.  Back then everything was fine but let's just go ahead and add that on too and make sure again.  Do you have plans for Christmas?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we're actually going to, we used to actually always go out to California during Thanksgiving for a week.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And visit my in laws in Thousand Oaks and this year, just because the plane flights are getting so outrageously expensive, we're going to drive out to LA.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> For about 2 weeks.  We're going to take a couple days and drive though the, you know, do a little sightseeing.
<b>DR:</b> That'll be nice.
<b>PT:</b> And hopefully a little mountain biking and then go to LA, stay there for a week and a half and drive back..
<b>DR:</b> Oh nice. Which route are you going, through Utah or Arizona?
<b>PT:</b> I think we go through, ah, Utah.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, that's my favorite because it's so pretty.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we go down through Zion and take the kids over there to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And do some hiking in there, you think, or mountain biking?
<b>PT:</b> I'm not sure.  There's some mountain biking, actually this place called Goose Berry Mesa.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> It's just kind of south of Zion.  Actually, I've never been to Zion, I've been to, you know, Price Canyon and pretty much everywhere else.  I've driven past it but, you know, been everywhere else in Utah except there.
<b>DR:</b> Huh, yeah, we've driven through, we wanted to stop, we just never had the time to, so I hope you get a chance to see some of it.  Okay, there's the Valproate is the other name for Depakote, so level for that and a liver function test and then should we set something for six months again?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> It seems like you're doing great.  
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I thought I'd get [INAUDIBLE] because we had this thing at this landmark weekend.  You kind of go through things, you set things up and kind of different things, you know, there's like a mother/child, a father/child, playmate/sibling, and, ah,  admirer/admiree, you know, how you speak and things
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> Most, you know, you start playing and hanging out and doing things fun, you know, that's kind of playmate/sibling.  The mother/child is like a nurturing, you know, and maybe authoritarian is like the father/child.  Our conversations tend to fit in these fields and then of course you have roles, you know, like child/child.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And whatever but it's been kind of interesting how, you know, talking about that and of course our new one is, there's a fifth field, it's like but you can't really, it doesn't really make any sense because of course you know it's like generated language, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> Generated, you know, it's something you've never said before.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> So it can't really fit in a field because once you've said it then it's going to fit into one of the fields.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, interesting, so you're learning a lot it sounds like.  Do you want to do a Monday at 12 again, is that a good time?
<b>PT:</b> That would be perfect.
<b>DR:</b> Do you want to do June 2nd?
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  If it turns out you're going to be on vacation, just give me a call and reschedule.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's like, I can usually have, now that I have my little smart phone, PDA thing, I can go a couple months but past there it's like.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's hard to plan that far ahead.  All right, well it was good seeing you.
<b>PT:</b> It was good seeing you.
<b>DR:</b> Glad you're doing well.  Anything before then, just give me a call, okay.  
<b>PT:</b> Thanks very much.
<b>DR:</b> All right, you bet, take it easy.
