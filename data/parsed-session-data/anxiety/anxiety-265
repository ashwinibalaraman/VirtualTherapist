The 37th Field Hospital was "red hot" during the last week
of January, 1944. All officers had been recalled from special
schools, medical corpsmen on furlough were called back. We
added our last group of nurses from various stations in the Sixth
Service Command. We hastily conducted "showdown inspections"
of our enlisted men's equipment in preparation for
departure. We were aware that we were scheduled to go to the
Pacific; all winter uniforms, except those needed on a trip to
the Coast, were turned in. "Sun tans" were issued to the men;
the officers and nurses purchased summer clothing from the
quartermaster depot.


There was a last week end in Mendota; most of the time
was spent in assembling clothing and equipment I would need
in a long period overseas. I said goodbye to our closest friends
and with some restraint gave five-year-old Richard Eaton a final
hug. He understood and seemed to look forward to his father's
adventure. "Send me a Jap sword, Daddy," were his final words.
There was a very small lump near my larynx. I hated to leave
Richard and Marion. Mrs. Leach and Miss Ruth Karger drove
to Camp Ellis, and we said some sort of a lumpy farewell. It was
not too emotional. Months of service in the army had accustomed
us to farewells; this one we only regarded as the beginning
of a longer separation.


The hospital unit was soon on its way to the West Coast.
Our enlisted personnel, medical officers and nurses totaled over
two hundred persons. (The personnel is listed in the appendix.)

We lumbered slowly across the country with frequent layovers;
as we were on a special train, its movements were sandwiched
into the schedules of faster regular trains. We hardly
noticed the scenery of the west as most of the men had traveled
this country during the preceding two years. We had our heads
down over the bridge or poker tables; the time passed rapidly.
Only at the Feather River Canyon did we lay the cards aside
in favor of the beautiful scenery. Soon we rumbled into Camp
Stoneman, where we were to stage for embarkation. We arrived
at the West Coast on 15 February 1944.


Within twenty-four hours Captain Edward Haskett, Captain
Harry Brown and I were detailed to go aboard the <i>U.S.S. West
Point</i>, in San Francisco Bay, to make preparations for the embarkation
of our unit. This was a fortunate assignment, for we
could choose the better bunks for ourselves! And we knew that
the food aboard ship was better than in camp. The remaining
officers had one last round of entertainment. Captain Isaac Hay,
of Melbourne, Florida, led the way; they were successful in
purchasing some Mexican whiskey. While attending a party at
a camp officers' club Doctor Hay stepped off a low platform
and sprained his ankle. It was a painful injury; I shall describe
Ike's appearance later when he boarded ship on February 18th.


The <i>U.S.S. West Point</i> was a worthy transport which had
already done a great service to this country and to Great Britain
in the years preceding our entrance into World War II. She was
originally christened the <i>U.S.S. America</i> in 1940, at Newport
News, Virginia, where she was built by the United States Shipbuilding
Corporation. Her sister ships were the <i>Manhattan</i>
and the <i>Washington;</i> they were designed to compete with ships
of larger class such as the <i>Queen Mary</i> and the <i>Normandie</i>. Her
sister ships had become troop transports and were known as

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When the <i>U.S.S. West Point</i> was a luxury liner her promenade
deck had been enclosed in glass; her stacks were red, white
and blue. The remainder of the ship was painted white in
1940. When she became a war transport she was beautifully
camouflaged, as she traveled without escort. In 1940 the area
which was later converted into a theater was a large lounge,
beautifully carpeted. She was originally owned by the United
States Lines.


Haskett, Brown and I got our sea legs while the ship was
lying in the bay; we also picked out the best bunks in a convenient
stateroom as our own. Soon our men came aboard, and
we stood at the head of the gangplank grinning as they carried
their heavy packs and val-paks aboard. We were tempted to
help Ike Hay as he struggled up the plank; his ankle was swollen
badly. It was so edematous that he was unable to lace his legging
over it. Ike was grinding out words which didn't sound like
incantations; his opinions of Mexican whiskey cannot be quoted.
We were sorry for Ike and gave him a lower bunk. He was later
able to hobble successfully to mess but was excused from the
two-hour watches to which we were assigned. We were envious
of his leisure, but he earned it in that fall from a six-inch platform.


On February 19, 1944, we were on the way, headed into the
domain of Neptunus Rex, with only a stopover at San Pedro

Washington's birthday was an eventful day as we took a
last wistful gaze at the coastline of the United States of America.
I wrote to Marion on that occasion and told her that one day
we'd return to the West Coast to see the Feather River Canyon
and to see the tip of land that I gazed upon through a porthole.
As we rolled southwest the rain was beating down heavily. We
had been tugged from the harbor; the <i>U.S.S. West Point</i> then
put about and we went out on our own power. When we passed
the dock our ship's whistle blew; a few navy men and the
military police gave us a smart salute. At the breakwater we
could see the heavy sea pounding over the rocks, delivering a
tremendous spray into the air. The green hills of the West Coast
were a sweet sight; they were soon lost from view. Shortly we
were sitting on the edges of our bunks reading the message from
President Roosevelt. (This stirring form letter is shown in the
appendix.)


The ship was fast; she drove through heavy waves at about
twenty knots per hour. The <i>West Point</i> was a large ship and
rode easily; very few men developed seasickness. We enjoyed
our days aboard and soon worked out schedules of reading, card-playing
and lounging topside to occupy most of our time. At
night Major B.J. Buck would have an informal class in astronomy.
He pointed out Orion, Saturn, Mars, Jupiter and the

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A daily abandon-ship drill at 1:30 in the afternoon served to
familiarize us with our emergency stations. We objected to the
hour for it broke into our "bogging." This drill was continued
throughout the trip.


During the first week the ship's store opened for sales and
we bought two of everything, for everyone knew now that we
were going to New Guinea. Most popular item was a cigarette
lighter which thrived on wind. A glass shaving mirror was very
popular. Prices were very low as the articles were tax-free. As
an example, cigarettes, were then selling in post exchanges for
$1.60 a carton; we could buy them aboard ship for $.45 a
carton. We were learning to treasure certain small articles, such
as knives, compasses, mirrors, lighters, razors and razor blades.
Later we found that we needed them badly and had we more
of these articles we could have done some very profitable trading
with the natives of New Guinea.


The flying fish always interested those soldiers who were on
their first cruise into the quiet waters of the Pacific. In my letters
I attempted to describe them; I knew that Richard would be
interested. After the first week at sea we began running into
schools of these small, silvery fish; singly they looked not unlike
a hummingbird as they rose a few inches above the surface of
the water. Their forms glistened in the bright sunlight. When
a group would break water it reminded me of a covey of quail.
The height of their flight was seldom more than two or three
feet, although Major Hay (Doctor Hay had been promoted)
saw one rise head-high above the water.


On February 26 we were picked up by three albatrosses, those
large, web-footed sea birds. They had long, narrow wings and
were very graceful in flight. The albatross is a powerful bird;
we could not have been closer than a thousand miles to land.
Lieutenant Armstrong, a naval officer, told me that they live at
sea and only go to islands to breed. We welcomed them as
escorts; it had been quite a lonely trip.


Lieutenant Armstrong had been in the Marquesas Islands

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Five days after leaving San Pedro we had already turned
back our watches three times, and we judged that we were about
at the 150th meridian somewhere south of Hawaii. During the
next twenty-four hours we thought that we would cross "the
line." It was becoming warmer daily. We had our first dance
topsides that night. All nurses and officers attended; the navy
muscled in, of course. We speculated on some method of
marking the more attractive nurses with a slap of luminous
paint on their gluteal regions, as it was dark. Our orchestra was
recruited from the army and navy men aboard. We paid no
attention to the blare of the orchestra and to the fact that a
sound detector of a submarine might pick it up. The speed of
the <i>U.S.S. West Point</i> would take care of the submarines!


The dance was a success. There were over a hundred nurses
to parcel out to the four or five hundred officers aboard. Sailors
in the orchestra were in their "whites." Light from a quarter-moon
was the only illumination, and later that was cut off by
the clouds. We enjoyed watching this effort at entertainment on
the small dance floor of the swaying deck. At each corner of
the small quarter deck a three-inch gun peered into the blackness.
On its port and starboard sides two sailors sat in swivel
chairs; they were looking through scopes to spot periscopes on
the dark sea. Later in the evening these sailors left the watch
and their chairs were deserted. It was a typical American scene;
we were within ocean-spitting distance of Pearl Harbor during
wartime. We were enjoying a dance topsides with a jazz
orchestra blaring our indifference to the lurking enemy.

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This indifference was reflected in the news of the day as we
crossed the equator into the South Pacific. The navy announced
the launching of the 27,500 ton aircraft carrier <i>Bennington</i> at
the Brooklyn Navy Yard; the <i>U.S.S. Shangri La</i> was simultaneously
launched at Portsmouth, Virginia. Aircraft strength
would ordinarily be regarded as a military secret; the United
States Navy permitted this news to go on the United Press
wire! I reflected then and wrote in a journal that this "proves
that when we win this war it will be through sheer power and
not through craft."


We became "Trusty Shellbacks" on 28 February 1944. The
identification card is reproduced in the appendix. There was
no ceremony. We had crossed the domain of Neptunus Rex.
We hardly regarded ourselves as landlubbers any more, but
I am sure that the navy men didn't regard us with any new
respect. We were ordinary soldiers on a transport and they
treated us accordingly.


Now we were six hours behind the central war time of the
Midwest. We judged that we passed west of the Christmas
Islands. The trade winds had shifted to a southeasterly direction
and seemed to be cooler than the northeast trades. The sun
appeared south of the equator; it would not cross the equator
until March 21st. The days were hot topsides, and would have
been intolerable were it not for the cooling ocean breezes. The
trade winds made the temperature appear about ten degrees
cooler than it actually registered on the thermometer. The
effects of the tropical heat were apparent on all hands aboard.
Movements were slower, gait seemed more slovenly, dress was
less immaculate. We had no real indication of the effect of heat
on dispositions but occasionally someone would lash out with
a bit of temper. It would subside directly when he was reminded
that is was due to the heat.


One eye was always peeled on the war news, for soon we
would be in a combat zone. A bulletin was published daily,
consisting of news from the ship's radio. Allied planes were
smashing at German troops and supply concentrations behind

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Winston Churchill was in the news; he reviewed the war before
the House of Commons and remarked, "This is no time
for sorrow or rejoicing. It is a time for preparation and effort
and resolution.... Let us try our best to do our duty. Victory
may not be so far away and will certainly not be denied us in
the end."


Anthony Eden, British Foreign Secretary, chimed in before
the House of Commons, "We are determined to continue the
struggle against Germany and Japan until both are utterly
defeated. We understand only too well how long-drawn-out has
been the agony of China, and we pledged ourselves in words
used at the Cairo Conference to persist in the prolonged operations
necessary to secure the unconditional surrender of
Japan...."


We studied these news dispatches with real interest. We
discounted them to some extent but sincerely hoped that we
would finally burrow through these clouds of war into the blue
sky of peace and productive living. When we had digested the
graver side of the news we turned to levity and sought to cheer
our nurses. For the ship's radio reported that "... out in New
Guinea an army nurse gave her brassiere to one of the native
girls to see what she would do with it. Later she met the girl
wearing the bra around her stomach. All the small items which

On Friday, 3 March 1944, the <i>West Point</i> crossed the 180th
meridian so that the next day became Sunday. We were somewhere
south of the Fiji Islands. The time was then about seventeen
hours ahead of central war time. It was difficult to keep
our watches right as the changes were so frequent. It was apparent
that we would shortly be at Noumea, New Caledonia.
We welcomed the prospect.


The roar of a plane took us on the run to a porthole two days
later. When we sighted it the plane was circling the ship and
was blinking its recognition lights. Our radar had apparently
picked it up miles out, for our "pom-poms" were trained upon
the course when it crossed the horizon. The plane was a B-24,
presumably from Viti Levu of the Fiji Islands. It was very
reassuring to see this friendly plane as we knew now that we
could abandon ship, if necessary, and be reasonably safe.


The low-lying mountainous coastline of New Caledonia was
the first sight on the following morning. We had traveled approximately
six thousand nautical miles and were at the end
of the long leg of our voyage. We had rounded the southeastern
coast of New Caledonia and were traveling in a northerly
direction. Land looked mighty inviting after two weeks at sea.
Even the sandy foothills of the mountains with their sparse green
vegetation made us envious of those going ashore. Land looked
doubly inviting, for the "scuttlebutt" of the previous forty-eight
hours was that our radar had picked up what must have been
a submarine. The sub did not respond to our call and it was
presumed to be an enemy vessel. It was about seventeen miles
away. We could not place reliance on these rumors, and we
dismissed them by saying that "land looked good."
