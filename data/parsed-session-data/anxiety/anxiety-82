BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
PATIENT: This place eats it! God, I've never seen (sighs) ...
COUNSELOR: Seen what?
PATIENT: Oh, I had to park seven blocks away from here. I, you know, I was here about on the money, but then I had to go all the way, phew...
COUNSELOR: To find a place to park.
PATIENT: Ooh, my shoes are all wet. You want me to ...
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 00:37) just don't put them on my beautiful couch.
PATIENT: (Breathing heavily) Oh, God. No, I drove; you know how that gets you. When you, when you - -you know I drove around here about four times and you've got all these damn one - you know when you hit a one-way street.
COUNSELOR: Uh hm
PATIENT: I go around this way and then I come, you know, I hit one near the place and then-and then I started running. I'm not quite in shape yet.
Oh...I don't know where to...(phone rings)
COUNSELOR: Hello? Okay. Could you...okay. Right, okay. Oh, okay. Okay. I just spoke to him. Okay. Okay, all right.
PATIENT: Oh, I know what it was. Did you check on the fees?
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Disapproved.
PATIENT: I think I was pissed at you last time about that. Do they give a reason? [2:05]
COUNSELOR: Well, I guess the thought that, you know, you should give perhaps some consideration to this-if this is meaningful to you. It's as meaningful as rantham (ph 2:20) and other stuff...
PATIENT: Yeah, but see...
COUNSELOR: I mean "Do I get a part-time job?" You have to take this into consideration also.
PATIENT: Okay, right, right. But I mean, I think I have good reasons for quitting that job. Other than neurotic or whatever the...you know the other ones they have. And I think, I think some of me, you know, like I try to think it through and feel it through as to why I quit the thing.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm.
PATIENT: And it's-the idea is not that I'm sitting on my ass all the time. I've been checking the papers.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: But I want a specific kind of job.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: But they're still going to leave it at that rate?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, well, I guess they also thought-well, like there are just nine more sessions left anyhow and any reduction would just be a token one anyhow. Let's say it went down to ten dollars...
PATIENT: Oh, so (inaudible 3:11) it wouldn't do (inaudible 3:12).
COUNSELOR: ...instead of thirteen. Right, so that would only be a difference of like twenty-five bucks in total anyhow. So what's the point?
PATIENT: Oh. I thought it would be more of a reduction, but they (inaudible 3:20)
Well, (chuckles) since that's the case, how can I spread those payments? 
COUNSELOR: Well you...
PATIENT: Like, in other words-now, I haven't paid for-I haven't paid for December yet. I haven't been billed for January yet. I paid for November. For instance, if I don't pay, let's say, for January by the end of January, what kind of things would they do?
COUNSELOR: Well, they might chop your head off.
PATIENT: Well, I (inaudible 3:57) think of that. But, I mean, will they-I'll pay it. I mean it's just...
COUNSELOR: I think that they'll be satisfied so long as you make some payment. Even if you don't pay the whole thing.
PATIENT: So that-their reasoning, then, would have been it wouldn't be that much of a deduction?
COUNSELOR: Yeah. See the minimum fee that could be charged is five dollars. I'm not taking this from them, but that's what I know. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So if there are nine sessions left, that would mean a reduction for you of eight bucks for each session and that would be a total of seventy-two dollars. Not such a big deal.
PATIENT: Well (laughs) seventy-two dollars is seventy-two dollars. It's just-well I guess maybe I'm a little pissed because it means I have to work more than I thought. I tried to get a job this morning. There was a thing with the school bus driving for about three and a half hours in the morning from six to nine-thirty which would have been really great. But it was gone already. [5:25]
 I think the thing that got me when you said wh-oh, yeah. One of the ramifications you have to think of when you quit your job is that-like to me to quit my job was a healthy sign.
COUNSELOR: Okay. But look. Is the A &amp; P going to charge you any less money because you quit your job when you go to buy food?
PATIENT: No, but the A &amp; P doesn't work on a sliding scale. Well, the A &amp; P will. I mean I can-technically I can go down and get public aid on that. And then the A &amp; P would yell out "Food Stamps" when I came in there or something like that. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm.
PATIENT: I don't think A &amp; P takes them, but...
COUNSELOR: Yes, they do. 
PATIENT: Do they take food stamps? I don't know.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 6:37) you were seeing in private practice. [6:40]
PATIENT: Yeah, but then I think would have started...
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 6:44) We would have started off higher.
PATIENT: Yeah. We would have started off around thirty-three. I'm sure. But that's like hypothetical. That's not the reality of the situation. Well I, you know, I can accept that it's what it's just I want-I'm not sure why-like when I left here last year you made some comment about Julio's or something else and I said...
COUNSELOR: (inaudible 7:24) places.
PATIENT: Yeah. (laughs) I said "I don't go there, I go to these other places." You know, in my own area. And it struck me when I left. I says "Now, why did I say that?" I says "I must have been irritated at you." Ah, hell. I don't know. Like this week I've been reading Freud's Introduction to Psychoanalysis all week long. So I got all this crap about-like, you know-unconscious thing which, honest to God, I can't. Okay, so I'm irritated...(Phone rings)...it's something that...
COUNSELOR: Hello? 
PATIENT: ...something that went on, but apparently didn't come out until later. And then I didn't know why I was. I think it-I think it was something like-I said "I've got to remember that." Because I says "If I don't, it'll be like there's something eating at me." [8:42]
Maybe a part of it was because I was not that sure. Because when I got back I went into this big long thing of why the hell I quit that job. And maybe from what-maybe (chuckles) because of what came from me or the way I took it, I said "Well, I'm not that dead certain as to why I quit the job." All I thought I quit it for is because it was-well, I did a thing. I says "Okay, when did I quit the job?", I asked myself. I quit it the day after I broke up with a girl. And then I said "Why did I quit the job?" And on the day I quit it, the rationality was that I wasn't happy with it. It was a strain on me anyhow. I didn't think I could go through another rejection working, you know, and go on with all that crap and all these other things. But the more I think about it...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: ...and not, you know, I don't know if I-this is what I-I-I don't know now, whether I'm kidding myself or whether I can really trust my-at least my external reasoning. It's-it's like one of the things my Ma said when I was home. And with Susie, the girl I-that we broke up at that time. I had this whole really weird kind of things associating her to my Ma. One of the things my Ma said when I was home was I should hold onto my job. And one of the things then-I don't know if it would-at what level it was-was that one of the things I wouldn't do was hold onto my job.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: It was like-I don't know how to explain it now. There's too many things that are bubbling around that I can't-I can't-I'm even stuttering. I can't-I don't even know where to begin today. [11:01]
All right. Let me just describe some stuff maybe-maybe we...
COUNSELOR: All right.
PATIENT: Like yesterday-the only thing I'm aware of now is that-like I started doing these breathing exercises. It's kind of a takeoff on Zen stuff.
COUNSELOR: A takeoff? Uh huh.
PATIENT: Where you just-you just concentrate your breath...
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: ...without trying to think of anything. And you don't try to keep things out, but you just try to concentrate on your breathing.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Your breathing. Um Hm
PATIENT: And you close your eyes. And I tried to do that like twenty minutes a day. And I did it on Monday, Tuesday. What is today? Thursday. I did it on Tuesday and Wednesday and today. All right. On Tuesday and-no I did it-I did it on Tuesday and Wednesday and today. Right. Okay. I set up this thing and I don't know. This is another thing that is really driving me nutty. The list keeping. I've got to-I've got to schedule my life now.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And the list keeping-I can't break it. It's one thing I truly cannot break. If I don't have it written down, I don't think I'm going to do it. 
COUNSELOR: You mean a list of things to do. Yes.
PATIENT: Things to do, books to read. I've set up a reading thing. I want to read this many books, this is there on the reading thing. This is the way I'm going to do my time. Part of it was, like with the bar thing, I wanted to avoid on Mondays and Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays I don't want go near them. Well anyhow, it worked this week. I don't know what I'll do next week.
But on Tuesday and Wednesday, I did these breathing things. The first time I ever did it was Tuesday-I did it twice. I play basketball at night on Tuesdays and Thursdays with a bunch of guys at the [YMCA (ph 13:17)] and I'm a fairly decent-you know on barn games-a fairly decent basketball player and I usually can shoot fairly decently. I always have. Except this year, when I've really shot shitty. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And I, you know, I feel like a dodo out there. Only on Tuesday, I was like, I played like my old self and there is a couple of guys down there who I played football with who I really-I get-they play basketball like babies. That's my impression. They-well, I don't know, maybe that is a little boy's game-maybe I'm part of that, too, but... I see it more in them maybe than in myself. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Anyhow, on Tuesday I played good ball and I attribute it to-in some way-to the breathing exercise. Well, I did them-I did them on Wednesday, too. And on both those days I didn't do drinking or anything else. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I stayed home and I read. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Okay, Wednesday night, I went out drinking-last night. This morning, and-I met a girl and we slept together-and this morning when I got up-she had to go to work, so I got up and I read awhile this morning and I had-I did-I was high, but I didn't get bombed or anything.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: When I-when I tried to do these things, I really became aware, I really became aware that everything was going around inside. It was like-it was like a feeling where I'm really anxious and uptight. It's like...
COUNSELOR: What are you anxious and uptight about? Drinking?
PATIENT: No, no, it's just general-okay, I was sitting there...
COUNSELOR: But what made that happen?
PATIENT: I don't know. It was either the drinking or-or that I had slept with this girl. Maybe a combination of the two. I got mad at somebody in the bar last night and-not angry-I just go this-very disgusted with two girls and so-you know, like-I don't know-I don't know what made it. But I couldn't-I could do them, but it was a real effort and it was like I had to overcome-I had to constantly overcome a bunch of things coming in from the outside.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Then yesterday-yesterday, things happened too, like I got a letter from my mother and when I get a letter from my one aunt, I have a typical way of reacting-it's going to be a long one. I don't read them, I just put them away. I can't stand to read them. And I got this letter from my Ma-usually I read my Ma's letters. I'm not really moved too much by them but I'll read them out of duty or something. And I didn't want to read it. And the first thing I thought of when I opened the letter-she mentioned that she had been in Staunton, which is where my sister lives.[16:33]
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I says "Uh oh, she saw the letter I wrote to my sister." 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And so I was really sweating it all the way through. I thought she had seen this-and I didn't-I skimmed it. I didn't really read it. I skimmed...
COUNSELOR: Just skimmed it to see whether she had seen your letter.
PATIENT: Yeah. That was about-that's all I gave a damn about and then I put it away. 
COUNSELOR: So she didn't mention anything about it. 
PATIENT: Yeah-and I didn't even. Yeah, I didn't-I must have felt like-um-I can't put it in-I felt like-like I felt three days ago when a doorbell rang-I was-at that time-this was Sunday night and it was a girl I haven't seen for a long time who we used to-I used to sleep with. And she was over that night and in the morning the doorbell rang and I don't know who-I've noticed that-almost every morning somebody rings my damn doorbell. I don't know what's going on.
COUNSELOR: Mailman?
PATIENT: No. It's too early for the mailman. It was around 8:30. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Well, most mornings I'll ring the buzzer but nobody ever shows. So I think it's just somebody trying to get into the building. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: But I had this-anyhow the doorbell rang-I had this feeling like-I can only describe it physically. My heart started beating faster and it was like...
COUNSELOR: Was this girl still with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was caught. You know, I'm caught. 
COUNSELOR: Caught doing what?
PATIENT: Caught sleeping with a girl, you know, screwing her. [18:28]
COUNSELOR: That's bad.
PATIENT: Oh, man, yes. That's-and I'm certain-I was certain she had to hear my heart pounding-and I thought-maybe that-maybe that's why I was uptight this morning. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: If I think something of the girl-you know, quite a bit-it's different. It's a little different then. But if it's somebody I meet at a bar and take home-and this way it's bad, too, because I know this girl fairly well but I don't-you know, I don't have that much feeling for her. And I mean it's just that-it's just like a...it's like a guilty feeling, I guess. That's what guilty feelings are like. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Anyhow it-I can see tons-not tons-I can see many different things. I honest to God, I can't arrange them. I can't see how one relates to another thing. Like I have this thing now that, either because I've read it this week or it really is part of me, that I never really have emotionally separated myself from my mother. I have never become myself. I have never disassociated. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I have never cut things or whatever you have to do. There was another thing on Saturday night. I had a-no, Friday night I was out drinking and a friend of mine got tickets to see a ball game, pro ball game. And so I got a date with a girl in the bar. I just asked her if she wanted to go and she said she would. So-this thing I've seen repeated. You know, in my life before. I picked this girl up and I began the whole thing by-by teasing her, what was the word-she was-spacey. Spacey is the word I kept using for her. Because she was like, slow to talk.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: She could talk if she chose to, but she was slow to talk. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And so for some reason or other, I had to play this kind of like, kind of teasing game. I'm not quite sure why. Either because I felt uneasy around her or... But it was like not only teasing her, but almost like insulting her in a grinning sort of way.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Anyhow we were supposed to double with these other people and we were in the stadium already and this friend of mine, the guy, played ball for Southern Illinois. He was a good ballplayer. And he played some of these guys that were playing pro ball now. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: He's real tall. He's about six three. Good-looking guy and a little Filipino girl that he's dating. And when they came in, I was dressed in a black turtleneck and, you know, just pretty plain. He came in-he had on one of these pin-stripe black suits with a dark blue shirt and a blue tie, looking sharp. And immediately I became aware of this-it's like he was better than me or he was dressed better, he knew the ball-game better.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I didn't think this then, but I became aware...
COUNSELOR: In hindsight, you realized that was what's going on inside you.
PATIENT: ...Right, right, right. Something clicked and immediately I'm checking out my date to see who she's looking at.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm. Whether she's looking at you or at him.
PATIENT: Yeah, right. And for the rest of the evening it was like compare and contrast. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And I really did-I think I really did that all evening long. And when he just had sat down he introduced me to his girl and I introduced to my date and he said-she said-he said she-his date lives at 4500 North and my-and I blurted it out-you know, I didn't really think about it. I said "Boy, that's really G U, isn't it?"
COUNSELOR: What does that mean?
PATIENT: Geographically Undesirable.
COUNSELOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And he knew what it meant, but she didn't. And it was kind of like, kind of a tenseness there. And I didn't make any more comment about it. But I says "Why the hell did I say that?" In other words, "What the hell are you-what are you taking chick way up there for?"
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That was my initial comment. What else happened? I had the feeling-which I was almost aware of while I was having it, that my date was more animated when she was talking to him than to me. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And at least I knew that this was going on.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm. You were very sensitive to your feeling that maybe he was a better man than you.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. What else did he do? There was one other thing. I can't put my finger on it yet. It got really late. We went out to a couple places and had pizza and stuff. And she lived in the Old Town area and this friend of mine-he's separated from his wife and he's going to get a divorce and all this. And he had a friend of his, had moved to an apartment so he-we got up to, well the last place we were at and he says "Hey, I know where there's a party tonight" and I'm looking at him-I knew there was no goddamn party around. And he says, yeah there was a party. I felt weird at that point because I had never asked this girl out before and I didn't know really what was going to happen. So...
COUNSELOR: You didn't know whether she'd sleep with you, you mean?
PATIENT: Yeah. So I guess-yeah, that-or I didn't know how she'd take it.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Because in my comparing and contrasting I had, you know, I had formed a picture of her, too. [26:59] 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: So anyhow, I said I was tired and I usually never get tired. I said I was kind of tired. And then the girl said-the girl I was with said "Well, if you're tired, we don't have to go." Which it-a weird reaction-it was like-it was like I felt that she wanted to go because of this other guy and not because of me. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And therefore, I would go just to put up-to suffer through it because I got some deal on that, apparently. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And so I said "Okay, we'll go." Well, we got there and the damn place was-the place was-he couldn't get the door open. So then we wound up going to her place and we had a drink or so there and then when I was leaving-like I wanted to get away quick. I had this feeling like-like I was sure I was never going to ask her out again. And it was like my way of getting back.
COUNSELOR: To not ask her out again.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And...
COUNSELOR: To not allow her to have you.
PATIENT: Right. And then I-and then I-the whole evening... I saw this guy the next night and I can't think if I really get to know-I don't think he has that much real-well there were other things that happened. I don't know. I can't make a judgment on him. I don't know him that well. 
There were other things, like instead of-instead of helping her-it was a slushy night-over stuff-I said "Would you like an arm?" And she didn't even answer, which is probably a damn good thing. 
COUNSELOR: Why? What do you mean "A damn good thing"?
PATIENT: That she didn't answer, you know, if it's slushy I should help her anyway and I didn't. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's like if I go out of my way to help someone I can't do it. It's for some reason-I've got to make a joke out of it. I can't just help somebody if they're-if it's a...(phone rings) [29:52]
COUNSELOR: Hello? Hi. No. Probably home. I'm tied up right now. Is there anything else? You want me to call you back? Okay, bye.
PATIENT: I don't know-that evening I was really like a-I couldn't help it while I was doing it, but I knew what was going on. And then-you know, I-like the word "considerate" sticks in my head.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Because the other guy was very considerate of his date. I don't think I'm considerate. I'm not usually considerate. I'm patronizing-patronizing is more what I am, like... If I'm in that kind of situation where I feel like I am-I'm in an inferior position, that all these sorts of feelings go through me.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: All the feelings like I described. In a really s...
COUNSELOR: So you patronize the other person to make her like you.
PATIENT: Well, you know, like include her in the conversation.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Things like that.
COUNSELOR: But do you that when you feel inferior? Or superior?
PATIENT: I do that-I guess I do it both ways. Because if I would-if I would-the way I thought the other guy was toward his date was considerate. The way I thought I was toward my date was kind of aloof and patronizing in a way. Although I didn't have to be that way because she could handle herself. She wasn't a-she wasn't out of it in social situations. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm, Um Hm
PATIENT: I would think I'd be more patronizing-like if I'm in a different position-if I'm in a position where I feel more-like I know more than the person I'm with or I know more than the other guy I'm with, then it's the other way. Then I'm very-apparently I'm very relaxed and I never worry about anything. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: The only-the only thing I can-like I thought back to this. When I was a senior in college I met a girl who was a roommate of my roo-well, my roommate's-my roommate and I-my roommate had his fianc�e and she had a roommate. And this, anyhow, to make it all work...
COUNSELOR: You took her out.
PATIENT: Yeah, we double-dated for the rest of the year and I always had the impression, the more I got to like her, the more the thing stuck in my mind, and I didn't recognize it, that she was more interested in my friend, Steve, that she'd much rather be with him, that she...
COUNSELOR: The only reason she went out with you was to be with him?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Really, really. I couldn't admit it, you know, but it was really-oh, man-I was really-I was really strong in that. It's like they couldn't-a girl really couldn't just like me. And when she does I can't accept it. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: It was that same sort of feeling, the same thing recurring again. And see, I can't link it up as to why it should be.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I mean, I'm on a kick now where, you know, like I-like this kind of therapy-I don't know what the hell other kinds of therapy are like. I think it's probably the best kind of therapy for me...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: ...because the other kinds of therapy, if it's directed, then I'm going to get in the same shit that maybe I've got to break out of. If it's non-directed, then it's either me going to do it or, or...
COUNSELOR: Or I'm going to be done.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. What I was going to say... I've been reading in-well this whole thing on the unconscious.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I mean it-I-I-I-what I'm trying to do is like, you know, start with Freud and not put so much stock on the interpretation as to how I can see things in myself, things that I wasn't previously aware of. See, what I don't know is if I can even-if I can-if I can even objectify myself at all-if I can get at myself.[35:43] 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: But enough things happen that cause me to really wonder what the hell's going on. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I can-I'm only-I just barely can see, like to me there should be patterns. There should be patterns emerging. There should be patterns...
COUNSELOR: That's right.
PATIENT: ...that would say if you think you're a pile of shit (phone rings) compared to all these different people...
COUNSELOR: Hello. This is Michael Dayton. Not that I know of, but would you call the secretary, please, at extension 32379? Two...yeah, thank you.
PATIENT: You know, okay, it's like apparently like I think of myself from the way I-you know, and the feelings I get. Okay, now those are conscious feelings. I know those things are there, but they're not at a spontaneous level, but it's like there's a time span of, let's say, an hour between when I (chuckles) know something's going on and when it actually, you know, gets way out there.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay, now. That I would say, then, would be a conscious feeling. That's something I should be able to recognize.
COUNSELOR: Without having to wait that hour.
PATIENT: Right. I mean, if I get to know myself well enough, then I should know it "bing", just like that. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: But then, then, the way I understand it now is that there are...
COUNSELOR: See, but what are saying is that everything should be conscious. 
PATIENT: No, no, no. What I'm saying is that's what I would say would be my conscious self which I don't know, either. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I'm convinced I'm, you know, emotionally a cripple because I can't recognize what I'm feeling until later. Delayed action person. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm, Um Hm, Um Hm
PATIENT: And the unconscious things...the unconscious things, then, would not come up, you know. I'm very confused in this because if something is unconscious, then I shouldn't know consciously anything about it. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean-I, that's the way I...
COUNSELOR: Well, that's the definition of unconscious.
PATIENT: Okay, right, right. Now, if I know now, let's say, or I'm beginning to get inklings at least part of some part of myself is that I don't think very much of myself. And I constantly compare...
COUNSELOR: And that's pretty conscious, isn't it?
PATIENT: ...to assess myself. Yeah right. And that can't be part of the unconscious.
COUNSELOR: It can be both.
PATIENT: How? How would it have got to the surface? That's the thing that goes through my mind. I says "How do I know that I'm not..." Let's say I identify a thing like that. Like it was fairly easy for me to identify labels that...(phone rings 39:13)
COUNSELOR: Oh, the phone (sighs), excuse me. Hello? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Can I call you back in about fifteen minutes? I have a client in my office right now. Okay.
PATIENT: The thing like, that's kind of driving me buggy is how do I know-I'll try-I'm trying to answer it, but how do I know that my perception, let's say, of that date on Saturday, is not really contrary to what I'm really all about underneath anyway?
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And I'm having trouble remembering my dreams. I can't remember my damn dreams. And sometimes I choose not to remember. I remember them and then I don't write them down and I forget them.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm, Um Hm, Um Hm
PATIENT: And see, I cannot for the life of me make the link-like for me I think I've got to find out-just in order to understand myself, you know, about my early years. And I can-the only things I can remember and I can't put them together chronologically...
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: ...is this thing, you know, with the circumcision. And my Ma said when I was home that when I was little and growing up, you know, very little, in the real-well whatever they have, the oral or whatever stages they have, you know, I was a hellion and I was impossible to control. She would beat me and things like that and I wouldn't shape up. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Okay. All of a sudden, when I get to be eight years old, and I start remembering things, I'm this obedient little boy who always, always in every situation-they used to-my Ma and my sister used to tease me because I'd never get mad and then they made this into a big virtue. "He never gets mad" that's what they'd...
COUNSELOR: Yeah. He's a good little boy.
PATIENT: But where? Where did I get to be that when originally, apparently, I was a fighter, I wouldn't give a damn. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: If, if what she says is true. If she had to beat me all the time. She says she couldn't-that it didn't work.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And so finally, she had to resort to things like putting me in a corner. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I got-again, I, I, I, completely-anything before five I can remember setting a fire, I can remember some sex things, I can remember-it must be like now I still have a ...
COUNSELOR: You can't remember after five?
PATIENT: I can't-before five I can't remember.
COUNSELOR: Oh, before five. 
PATIENT: If I could ever peg when the circumcision thing was, that I should be able to get a date on it. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Like if that was in forty-five or forty-six, that would have put me at five years old and to me that seems right now to be something...
COUNSELOR: Like a turning point.
PATIENT: ...something so crucial in my mind that...
COUNSELOR: Well, let's assume that it is that crucial turning point. And then maybe it doesn't matter exactly when did happen.
PATIENT: Yeah, but what I'm trying to establish-I want to-see, what I want to do is establish in my brain a point in time that I can relate some of these other things that I remember. 
COUNSELOR: As happening before or after that event...
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because what I want to do is push it back earlier yet because I can't remember the beatings-
COUNSELOR: Um Hm [43:18]
PATIENT: ...or the spankings or whatever you want to call them. All I can remember is things like being hit in the face and somebody really yelling hard at me and I don't know if that's real or if it isn't. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Because to me-to me to understand-it's incomprehensible why I would feel this way. And now I'm very conscious that I'm constantly assessing things. I think that's what I'm doing-I don't know, maybe I'm not doing that. But that's what I think consciously I'm doing.
COUNSELOR: Assessing yourself anyhow.
PATIENT: Yeah, myself. It's always myself in relation to somebody. I never can just let them be, I've got to see, I've got to, it's like add them up and stack them up.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I-everything I read tells me that it goes back. It goes back to those early-and like I can remember high school things, too now.
COUNSELOR: What can you remember? What do you mean you remember high school things?
PATIENT: High school things where I had the same feelings and I couldn't-then I wasn't even-I couldn't admit them to myself at all, but I remember I had the feelings. Such as, one time-this was another-some things come back to me, they're starting to come back a little, but I can't... I've got to locate a point so I can work with that. Like a thing like this: When I was in, I think my sophomore year, my sister was always very popular and starting dating-I think she was dating when she was in ninth grade. I never went out with a girl until after college. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm. Right.
PATIENT: One of the questions I asked when I wrote to her was how she felt about that. How did she explain that to her friends? Because a lot of her friends would have probably...
COUNSELOR: Do you think she thought you were queer?
PATIENT: Either that or-no, I don't think queer. One girl said like a woman-hater. I don't know if that is...
COUNSELOR: Did you think you were queer?
PATIENT: No, I don't-well I don't know... If queer means that I was afraid of girls, I was afraid of them. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I'd get red...
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: ...when, um...
COUNSELOR: If it means attracted to other men?
PATIENT: Not consciously.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I knew how I-I know how I felt toward girls. I would always feel like-I think afraid, or embarrassed (phone rings).
COUNSELOR: I don't understand this phone today. Hello? Oh, okay.
PATIENT: But see, then, even at that time I remember I had a saying to myself, I said "Okay", I said "you can..." there's three areas of life. There's work, friends and marriage. It doesn't really matter if you leave one out. That was one way I rationalized it. 
COUNSELOR: So you were going to leave marriage out?
PATIENT: Yeah. And there was a thing on...
COUNSELOR: You know, in sense Johnny, it strikes me you're still afraid of girls. That is, you're afraid that they won't approve of you. Your antennae are always up on your double date or something like that...
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...that they'll like the other guy better than you. You're afraid that they'll reject you.
PATIENT: I can still-you see, when I did start, I never worked it through. I never asked myself what was operating here. Homosexuality would play-would play in there some way because that's a thing it's like you wonder.
COUNSELOR: But as you describe it, it doesn't sound homosexual, it sounds asexual. 
PATIENT: Yeah. See, because there's really some odd things that I have never dealt with. You know, until-I'm trying to deal with them now. [48:20]
COUNSELOR: Okay. Like what?
PATIENT: Well, this thing like in high school. It was just this embarrassment. I remember one time when I was a junior-a junior in high school-the counselor who was Howie Czarsky who was a masculine kind of no shit kind of guy, who was the leader of the DeMaios which was anti-religion and all this stuff. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And I'm a big, you know, I uphold the faith and all that shit. And this guy was trying to get me and another guy to go to the prom. Well the prom, number one, is bad because it's dancing.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Good Christians don't dance. It's bad number two-well, I had these rationalizations lined up, but the big thing was I avoided him for two months because I knew he wanted to press me about asking a girl. I was embarrassed as hell just to see him. I avoided him for two months after the prom was over because I didn't want to face him. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: It was things like I can't remember how I got money when I was in high school. I know I had a paper route late. I can't remember buying my own clothes until-in any large degree, until I was in Seminary. I remember, I looked at some of the clothes-we had sports pictures taken-and it was really weirdo clothes I was in. I mean I, you know...
COUNSELOR: Yeah, different from the other kids? 
PATIENT: I didn't buy them. Yeah, yeah, the clothes weren't all that good. I never paid much attention to that. You know, it was like, I think I hid behind the religion thing. I think that covered a lot of it. And I refused to allow myself to deal with anything like that because I used the religion thing to kind of-for instance, you never can think anything-well there's other things, too, behind that-but you can't think anything bad of your parents. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: You know, because you're supposed to love and honor your parents. But, there's other things I think are deeper than that. It was just-I think of things like I really feel shitty if I shit on my Ma. I think that's more real than me using that fa�ade, you know, that layer. And it was things like in the Walter League...
COUNSELOR: In the what?
PATIENT: Oh, we have this thing-the Catholic Church-this is a whole-it's-the Catholic Church is a weirdo system. It's a two million member family, three million now, but it's a whole way of thinking in there that's unbelievable, where I grew up. Anyhow, they have a youth group and they nominated me for President or Vice-President, I guess it was. And I had this big thing about denying it. I didn't want any part of it. [51:41]
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And instead of just saying "No, thank you, I don't choose to run", I made a big deal out of it. I wasn't going to run and so the deaconess of the church, the woman there, she said "It's stupid. Why not run? If they think you've got enough on the ball to run, why don't you run?" I said "Okay, I will" and so I ran and I got beat.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And it was like going to be a priest and then being rejected by your (inaudible at 52:09].
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I remember that I really, I was just flattened by that. I was just flattened. And even before that, a lot of times when a meeting would be over, like kids would get together-I wouldn't get together, I would just walk home and I'd feel sorry for myself. The same thing was true like in-I remember one incident in grade school where when school would be out, some of the kids would chase me. And I could always run faster-I had to run faster. If they were to catch me, they'd beat the hell out of me. 
COUNSELOR: Why did they want to beat the hell out of you?
PATIENT: I think it was because I had a big mouth. 
COUNSELOR: About what? What did you have a big mouth about?
PATIENT: A lot of things. I think I would tease people. I can remember a couple-I remember one time where twenty guys were chasing me after school. And I don't remember how the hell I got into that one. That was in first or second grade.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I never thought of that. There was a game this one guy had where he put me in the center of a circle and he says "We're going to play the nail game." And so he passed out nails to everybody in the group and these guys are mad at me for some reason.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: And when they had me in the middle, they said "Let's get him." And three guys hit me before I got out of that ring.
COUNSELOR: What was this all about?
PATIENT: I don't remember! For some reason he was mad at me. All I remember is that I was tricked again, you know. I was tricked into the damn game by guys that were really my-who I thought were my friends. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: I had about three close friends-I had four, actually.
COUNSELOR: You almost felt betrayed by them, huh?
PATIENT: Well in that instance, yeah. I mean, it's, it's the more I...
COUNSELOR: Every time you thought everything was going to be okay, with these guys, with the deaconess, running for Vice-President, stuff like that, you always got screwed.
PATIENT: Yeah, and the way I would react was it just says like you-it's almost like "You got what you deserved" that's the feeling.
COUNSELOR: But what did you do to deserve it?
PATIENT: I don't know! I don't know!
COUNSELOR: Maybe that's something you ought to think about.
PATIENT: Well, I do! I keep-the more I do-I push it back and as I push it back, I come up with the circumcision thing and then before that, I don't know.
COUNSELOR: But how about-what were you doing to these other guys that made you different? Why did they pick on you?
PATIENT: I knew I had a big mouth and I teased people. [55:01]
COUNSELOR: And what did you tease them about? What do you tease people about now?
PATIENT: Usually it-I can't-I'm trying to think of a specific. Well this girl the other night, it was spacey. Why do I know she was spacey? She was spacey because-it was a personal thing.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Spacey because she talked slow.
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Spacey... Oh, I told her she was-watching her put her coat on was like watching grass grow. She moved slow.
COUNSELOR: You said that to her?
PATIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: Great. And then what...
PATIENT: She did it, though, she really did! She took an hour to put her damn coat on!
COUNSELOR: I understand, I understand. But when people put you down in return for your putting them down, you can't understand why that is?
PATIENT: Well-I-yeah, but if it's friendly, you know.
COUNSELOR: Like "Hey, (inaudible at 56:11) chick, that's my friendly way of talking to you.
PATIENT: Well I maybe see it. It might be underneath, I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Next week, 1:30?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay (inaudible 56:23) still surviving. If you hear of any-do they have a part-time job thing around here, like a job board?
COUNSELOR: There is a personnel office. I don't know whether they have part-time jobs. It's at 62nd and McIntire.
PATIENT: 62nd and McIntire? 
COUNSELOR: Wait, wait. I'll give you the exact address. At least that's where it used to be. Second floor of McIntire. McIntire is-956 East 62nd. 
PATIENT: Can I write that...Okay.
COUNSELOR: That's at 62nd and McIntire. That's just a couple blocks away.
PATIENT: Oh, just straight that way?
COUNSELOR: Um Hm
PATIENT: Maybe I'll walk over there now. Isn't there anybody going to oppose ending this thing?
COUNSELOR: Isn't there anybody going to do what?
PATIENT: Oppose ending-abolishing the counseling center?
COUNSELOR: I don't know.
COUNSELOR: So long. See you next week.
END TRANSCRIPT??
