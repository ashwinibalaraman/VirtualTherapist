Engaging children requires a special set of strategies built on
a knowledge of child development, a high comfort level
with children, and good interpersonal skills. The interpersonal
skills that facilitate engagement with adults and children
include (a) empathic responding (sharing in what the person is
feeling and experiencing), (b) unconditional positive regard (accepting
the person in a nonjudgmental way), (c) genuineness
(displaying who you are in an honest manner), (d) active listening
(showing with your words and body that you are attuned to what
the person is saying), and (e) the capacity to help solve a problem
or manage a crisis.


The practitioner who works with children should have as a
foundation the previously mentioned interpersonal skills but
should also be aware of the unique characteristics of the child-adult
interaction process. Children have very little power and
often do not believe that they are engaged in voluntary equitable
interpersonal relationships with adults. Moreover, children in the
child welfare system often view adults suspiciously because of
their experiences of adults as abusive or neglectful and as having
the power to disrupt their families. In addition, children do not

The following general engagement strategies are useful in
work with children:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Getting on the same level as children (e.g., sitting on the
floor or in a child-sized chair)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Using modes of communication with which children may
be more comfortable (e.g., play, stories, poems, rap music,
and art activities)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Nurturing children in a case appropriate ways (e.g., feeding
them, using touch judiciously, providing a small present,
responding to their needs immediately, and
attending to their thoughts, interests, and wishes)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Following the child's lead (e.g., determining how directive
to be, how to manage behavior, and how deeply to
address feelings by what messages the child gives about
these issues)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Being trustworthy (i.e., being true to your word, keeping
appointments, following up on issues you agreed to, not
making empty promises, and ensuring that what the child
tells you will remain confidential if possible)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Providing a safe haven for the child (i.e., letting the child
know with your words and behaviors that he or she is not
only physically safe with you but also psychologically
safe--that you will not hurt him or her and that you will
respond to his or her needs)

Engagement strategies vary with the different developmental
levels through which children proceed. It is important to note
that chronological age does not always coincide with children's
developmental level. Many children encountered by child welfare
practitioners may be developmentally delayed. Thus, it is important
to determine at which developmental level children are
through an informal interview with caregivers about general

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Infants and toddlers:</i> The developmental predilection of
infants and toddlers to attach to a few primary caregivers
suggests that practitioners should not attempt to
engage them. This is particularly true for children
between 6 and 24 months of age, when they may
evidence varying levels of separation and stranger anxiety.
Attempts to work with these children should ideally
be conducted in the context of the child's current
home environment in the presence of the child's current
caregiver. Young children need to see that their
caregivers (no matter who they are) approve of their
relationship with another adult. These children should
have to develop relationships only with another permanent
caregiver, however, and not a caseworker or
other practitioner. Observational strategies, rather
than engagement per se, should be employed to determine
how the case should progress.


<i>Preschoolers:</i> Preschool children have made considerable
cognitive, social, and emotional advancements that
allow them to interact capably with strange adults.
Because play is the preschooler's most salient medium
of communication and learning, these children should
be engaged through play. Adults who get on the floor
and use the children's toys (or who have their own
stash of toys) to create a joint play experience often
expedite the engagement process. Similarly, joint storytelling
and art activities invite the preschool child to
interact more fully with the strange adult. Accepting
how these children view the world (e.g., fantasizing
about their ideal biological parents) is also important.
Assuring the children that you will try to make sure
they are safe (e.g., throwing the monsters out the
window and keeping the bad guys away) is also an
effective engagement strategy.


<i>School-aged children:</i> Children during this developmental
period are invested in self-identity, peer relationships,
and task accomplishment. Adults engage school-age
children by expressing interest and belief in these

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Adolescents:</i> Because adolescents have the cognitive capacity
to understand the world in general, the best approach
is to be honest and straightforward. Their
complex thinking and verbal skills allow them to discuss
their situations candidly. Their inability to construct
their futures, however, requires that the
practitioner balance respect for their ideas with structure
and a strong message that they will be supported
through the transition to adulthood. The engagement
process is also facilitated by the practitioner's willingness
to become a student of (not an expert in) the
adolescents' world, including the pop culture they
follow, their perceptions of their environment, and
their experiences. Maintaining confidentiality is crucial
with adolescents. In addition, using an age-specific
peer group approach may be helpful.


In conclusion, engaging children is a process that requires
good interpersonal skills and an understanding of the unique
characteristics of children. Practitioners should give children a
strong message through their words and actions that they are
trustworthy and sensitive to children's needs. Engagement strategies
should be selected that capitalize on the capacities and
preferences of children at different developmental levels.

Many families at risk for child maltreatment may have a
history of difficulty in forming and sustaining mutually
supportive interpersonal relationships. Furthermore,
they may not have had positive experiences with formal systems.
One of the essential challenges for practitioners is to form positive
connections and partnerships with families so that families will
have an opportunity to handle the difficult challenges in their
lives. Experience has demonstrated that successful intervention
and treatment depend heavily on the quality of one's relationship
with the client or family. Whether one's role is to interview family
members as part of the initial assessment or to target outcomes
for risk reduction, the quality of one's work is directly dependent
on one's ability to develop a working relationship with family
members. This chapter outlines skills that are effective in building
the helping alliance.


? <i>Communicating Concern for All Family Members</i>


Simply stated, this involves sincerely caring about what happens
to the client and communicating that you care to all family

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Clarifying Expectations and Purposes</i>


One of the best ways to develop a helping alliance with your
clients is to clearly explain the helping process and your role to
work together toward solutions. Many of the difficulties labeled
a "resistance" or "lack of cooperation" can be attributed to a lack
of clarity or unrealistic expectations by your client about what
you will or will not do. Each helping relationship has a unique,
individual purpose. Depending on your role with the agency, this
purpose may be short term if you conduct initial assessments, or
it could be longer term if you provide continuing services.
Although the purpose of your relationship with your clients may
be clear to you, it may not be clear to your clients. Thus, part of
your responsibility is to work with your clients to come to
agreement about the purpose of your relationship with them.


? <i>Clarifying Your Authority and Power</i>


There are two aspects of authority in child protection practice
helping relationships. The first is usually referred to as the
institutional aspect in that it is derived from your position and
function within your agency. The second aspect is psychological
in that clients give workers the power to influence or persuade
because they accept them as sources of information and advice--
as experts in their field. This is an especially crucial element for
child protective services workers. Mistakes can be made by
abdicating one's authority (e.g., "My supervisor made me do it").
Abuses of power and authority can also jeopardize your relationship
with your clients (e.g., "If you don't do this, I will see to it
that your kids are taken away"). Particularly with families that
require the use of court intervention, it may be necessary for you

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Clarifying Commitment and Obligation</i>


In the helping relationship, both client and worker must be bound
by commitments and obligations if the purposes of intervention
are to be achieved. A commitment to the conditions and purposes
of the relationship allows the client to feel safe and reduces the
testing behavior that usually marks the beginning of a relationship.
Once a commitment to the relationship has been established,
and the limits of time, place, and purpose have been
accepted, each participant is able to depend on the predictability
of the other's behavior, attitudes, and involvement. With some
families, this may mean mutually agreeing on what you and the
family will work on together, who will do what and when, and
for how long you and the family will work together. For other
clients, arriving at agreement on commitments and obligations
may be an evolving process. This may be something that you work
on together over time as your client increasingly trusts you.


? <i>Communicating Acceptance and Expectation</i>


This element emphasizes the importance of individualization,
acceptance, client self-determination, and a nonjudgmental attitude.
One of the most effective ways to communicate acceptance
is to try to understand the position and feelings of each client as
a unique human being with distinctive feelings, thoughts, and
experiences. As this concept relates to child protection practice,
it means that one does not talk about the "sexual abuse case" and
make certain assumptions about what individual family members
will be like based on certain characteristics or facts. Each new
"case" is actually a family made up of individual members, all of
whom are individual human beings. Each of them, and the family
as a whole, should be looked to for help in understanding their
problems and life circumstances from their individual and collective
points of view. Acceptance does not mean that we will always
agree with our clients. It also does not mean that we forego our

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Communicating Empathy</i>


Practitioners and researchers agree that empathy is a necessary
quality of the helping relationship. The process of entering into
the feelings and experiences of another--knowing what the other
feels and experiences--should begin before we even meet families
for the first time. This "tuning in" that we do before we first talk
with the child, mother, father, or other caregiver opens the door
to understanding more completely the actual experience of the
child and family. This process is especially important when
working cross culturally (see Chapter 9, this volume). It is
important that beginning workers distinguish between the capacity
to feel an emotion deeply and the need to remain professionally
separate from their client's situation. In their effort to be
empathic with children in particular, some new workers lose their
objectivity and "overidentify" with the children's perspective.
This position makes it difficult for them to be empathic to other
family members, which leads to counterproductive outcomes for
the family as a whole.


? <i>Communicating Genuineness and Congruence</i>


In some ways, communicating genuineness and congruence combines
many of the other concepts already discussed. To do this,
we must seek(a) an honest knowledge of ourselves--of who and
what we really are; (b) a clear knowledge of agency procedures
and policies and of the professional role both in their meaning to
the worker and in their meaning to the clients; and (c) an
internalization of the first two aspects and our concern for the
other, acceptance of clients, and commitment to their welfare and
to the authority aspects of the workers' role and position so that
these qualities are so much a part of us that we no longer need
to be consciously aware of them and can turn our full attention

Currently, there is much talk in the human service field
about the need to find ways to engage clients from a
multitude of different cultures. Although there are those
who debate the necessity of having a multicultural approach, the
need seems very clear. It occurs because of the increasing diversity
in the United States, inadequate service delivery to people of
color, and fewer numbers of professionals of color in the field
than clients of color.


There are three essential principles that must operate in the
background when we work cross culturally. First, we need to
believe that diversity is a good thing and understand that having
different ideals, customs, attitudes, practices, and beliefs does
not, in and of itself, constitute deviance or pathology. If we
approach culturally different clients from this perspective, we will
more likely communicate respect. Second, it must be understood
and accepted that we all have biases and prejudices. If we are not
aware of our own prejudices, we will not be challenged by new
experience, nor will we understand intense emotional reactions
to clients caused by such biases and prejudices. Finally, it is
necessary to be aware that the role of helper provides power, and

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

With these principles well established, I present the following
concrete approaches:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Gain basic knowledge of culture by reading and talking with
colleagues; recognizing that it is impossible to learn everything
about every culture in a multicultural society. Basic
knowledge includes information on family values, strengths
of the culture, religious and spiritual views, language and
communication styles, views of wellness, behavioral and
emotional expressiveness, views on sex roles and sexuality,
child-rearing beliefs and patterns, the level of assimilation
and acculturation, racial and ethnic identity, and time perspective.
Remember that there is heterogeneity within cultures,
and that this information should provide only an
initial framework for understanding a client's culture. Even
when this information is not available, be aware that these
are the areas in which one can expect variations and differences
attributable to culture as opposed to pathology. Clients
are a good source of information regarding their
particular culture; in the field of child maltreatment, however,
professionals must be careful to guard against the
possibility of cultural camouflage by perpetrators. One still
needs enough information and resources to delineate what
is culturally deviant.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. When making introductions, it is important to introduce
yourself by your professional title. For those from many
cultures, this builds their confidence in you. The client
should be addressed formally and then asked how he or she
would like to be addressed. This connotes respect.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Explain your role and how you can help. Different cultures
have different ways of helping and may not know what you
can do to help.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
4. Explore the client's understanding of the problem. The
client may have a different view due to particular cultural
values. It is essential to keep both perspectives in mind when
addressing the problem to establish and maintain an alliance
with the client.

5. Communicate that you are listening and are interested in
what the client has to say by making direct eye contact, brief
utterances, and nonverbal communication. When the client
has finished talking, summarize what you have heard.

6. Identify and acknowledge client strengths. This helps the
client to see that, despite the problem at hand, areas of
competence are recognized.


7. Be open to exploring the client's feelings about working
with someone outside his or her own culture.


It is important to realize that these are only basic guidelines
for engaging clients across cultures. Professionals should seek out
training opportunities to more fully understand their feelings and
beliefs about diversity and multiculturalism and to explore the
impact of their own cultural experience on their interactions with
clients.

Effective use of authority, reduces opposition and assists in
engaging families. Several factors make this a difficult
proposition. First, there may not be agreement between the
practitioner and the family about the nature of effective intervention.
From the child protective services (CPS) worker's perspective,
effectiveness may be related to the availability of services and
the manner in which services are offered. From the perspective
of family members served by CPS, effectiveness is influenced by
their perceptions of the value of services and the extent that they
believe that their perspective is heard and included in the assessment
and service plan. A second factor is related to recent changes
in the nature of the CPS response. Although in some agencies
services include an assessment and actual service provision, in
other agencies the emphasis may be on only an assessment of
danger focused on protecting children at imminent risk. Using
authority effectively and engaging the family will be much easier
within some of these frameworks than in others. A third factor
relates to the worker's perception about the family. Views of
parents range from being hostile adversaries unconcerned with
their children's needs to being active, positive participants who
wish their children to be safe and healthy. If workers perceive
family members as uncooperative, it is much less likely that they

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

1. Contact with families in an assessment role should be carried
out in a courteous, respectful fashion, assessing strengths
and assets as well as problematic circumstances.


2. CPS workers should quickly elicit the parent's view of
concerns and wishes for assistance, conveying understanding
of the parent's viewpoint, including reservations
about CPS involvement. Child welfare service recipients
who feel threatened by a situation are apt to defend themselves
verbally or physically. They may deny harm, blame
others, or challenge authority. Rather than consider such
responses as pathological, as indicators of refusal to take
responsibility for one's actions, or as personally directed at
the CPS worker, it is more useful to consider these responses
as normal reactions when valued freedoms are threatened.
Hence, to state that "most people don't like someone coming
into their home to talk about child safety" can convey
empathy and help establish rapport.


3. CPS workers should be matter-of-fact, explanatory, and
nondefensive in explaining the legal authority that permits
them to conduct an assessment of child safety. It is important
not to get into a debate about this authority but, rather, to
state what it is and what legal recourse the client might have
to challenge it. Such an explanation need not be adversarial
and should explain how it is the job of CPS to assist parents
and the community in ensuring safety for children. Legally
delegated authority also entails nonnegotiable requirements.

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

4. Opposition to contact can be reduced by clarifying available
choices, even when they are constrained; by emphasizing
freedoms still available; and by avoiding labeling. For example,
CPS recipients may be able to select from a list of
providers of parenting classes or chemical-dependency assessors.


5. To earn the respect needed to psychologically influence
parents, in addition to the power of legally delegated
authority, the CPS worker should be a good listener who
strives to understand the potential client's viewpoint. In
addition, making and keeping commitments to CPS recipients
enhances the CPS worker's credibility.


6. The CPS worker should explore and include, where possible,
parental wishes for the health and safety of their children
in service agreements to enhance their co-ownership
of the plan.

When you enter into a relationship with someone who
has not invited you to do so, you are likely to be facing
a difficult encounter. Ronald Rooney (1992) termed
the normal reactions of people to unwanted intrusions by professionals
<i>reactance</i> instead of <i>resistance</i>. If you have not been freely
sought as a helper, try to normalize the reactance responses that
can appear as resistance, denial, and hostility. Do not personalize
these reactions. In fact, the most difficult encounter you may have
is with the apparently compliant person. Although compliant
people may seem welcoming and willing, they may be less likely
to engage with us and move toward change.


One of the most difficult encounters, particularly during the
initial contact, is with the person or family with a history of
violence. During these encounters, or at critical points in your
work with people with a history of violence, their emotions and
behaviors may escalate. Escalation begins when the typical reactance
responses become filled with mounting anxiety. Pacing,
sweating, stammering, shakiness, and breaks in eye contact signal
mounting anxiety. Anxiety can build to agitated defensiveness.
Belligerence, yelling, intimidation, pressured speech, or staring
indicate mounting escalation that, if continued, will lead to acting
out. Verbal threats, rapid movements, standing or movement

Your self is your only tool for handling difficult encounters.
You may be uncomfortable with a person's normal reactance but
still actually be quite safe. It is important to differentiate when
you are uncomfortable from when you are unsafe (see Chapter
119, this volume). Use the signs of mounting anxiety and agitated
defensiveness to determine whether you are actually at risk.

The focus of this chapter is emotional reactions, yours and
your client's, and how awareness of these feelings can
make your child protection work more effective and less
stressful. When the possibility of child abuse is raised, powerful
emotional reactions often occur. It is common for suspected
abusers to express anger, for the parents who learn their child
may have been abused to feel horror and grief, and for the
children to feel frightened, embarrassed, and ashamed. Child
victims and their families may also experience anxiety, confusion,
depression, and sadness. As a child protection professional, you
are exposed to all these intense feelings. You experience them
through the lens of your own personal history, education, training,
and previous professional experience. Your work conditions,
which may include limited resources, a high workload, a modest
salary, and inadequate work space, can make it even more difficult
for you to be empathetic and respectful while remaining clear and
focused in your effort to ensure that children are safe and
adequately cared for.

? <i>Acknowledging Feelings</i>


Learning how to enhance your work through awareness of
emotional reactions begins with simply paying attention to emotional
reactions and considering the possible thoughts, beliefs,
and concerns associated with them. One of the most empathic
things that you can do for a person is to acknowledge that
person's feelings. By addressing a client's feelings, you can open
up important thoughts, beliefs, and concerns for discussion.
Doing this can also decrease the intensity of the client's emotional
reactions and enable you to provide information to address the
client's speculations and fears.


Attending to our own emotional reactions is equally important.
Strong emotions can be contagious. Anger is especially
infectious. By remaining aware of feelings, you can decide when
to address them with words or with actions. If you determine that
a client's rage is beginning to kindle your own anger or fear, you
may want to defuse the situation by taking a break or offering the
enraged person something to eat, even if it is only crackers or
candy. Food is a universal peace offering. Empathizing with angry
clients may also help diffuse their anger.


Acknowledging one's own feelings can also be appropriate
and healthy, especially with colleagues and friends. Colleagues,
supervisors, and family members can help us deal with our most
challenging feelings and can often provide different perspectives
on difficult situations.


One of the challenges of child protection work is to avoid
expressing negative feelings toward people who we think have
abused children. Remembering that many persons who abuse
children were also abused during their childhood lessens this
temptation. It is possible to empathize with the pain in a person's
life that may have contributed to their committing child abuse
without condoning abusive behavior.


? <i>A Balanced Perspective</i>


It is important to keep in mind when dealing with clients' intense
feelings that we usually have very little to do with what is really
