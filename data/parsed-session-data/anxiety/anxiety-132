Issues</b></font>

MARJORIE MONTAGUE AND
MARCELO CASTRO


Before we embark on a discussion of the concerns and issues surrounding
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), it seems important to provide
some background on the changes that have occurred over the past two
decades in the conceptualization of the disorder. It is generally agreed that
the estimated prevalence rate of ADHD among school-aged children is
between 3 percent and 5 percent. Research supports this prevalence rate,
although studies vary considerably in the percentages reported (APA, 1994;
Barkley, 1998). Safer and Malever's study (2000) reported that about 3 percent
of school children in Maryland were on medication for ADHD. Given
that not all diagnosed children are on medication, the percentage of children
with ADHD probably exceeds that rate. Additionally, ADHD is no longer
considered a childhood disorder. Indeed, longitudinal studies have found
that approximately 75 percent of children continue to display symptoms of
ADHD into adulthood (for example, Biederman et al., 1996). Because
ADHD is a lifelong condition that is manifested differently over the various
developmental stages, consideration must be given to differential diagnosis
and treatment.


Definitions and diagnostic criteria have been re-examined several times
since symptoms were first noted in the second edition of the <i>Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (DSM-II) (APA, 1968) as

[p. <i>400</i>]

Inattention means that an individual has difficulty sustaining attention
when effort is required. Behaviors associated with inattention include
carelessness, difficulty staying on task, not listening, disorganization, failure
to finish schoolwork and chores, distractibility, losing things, and forgetfulness.
Inattention may be less or more noticeable depending on
contextual factors. Children with ADHD seem to have an attentional bias
toward novelty because they generally respond favorably to novel and
stimulating activities and frequently are able to sustain attention in these
situations. Hyperactivity implies an inordinate activity level. Impulsive
individuals seem unable to control their behaviors and appear to act without
thinking. Impulsivity implies a problem with self-regulation. Hyperactive
and impulsive behaviors include fidgeting and squirming, constant
movement, inability to stay seated for a reasonable time, talking excessively,
difficulty waiting or taking turns, and interrupting and intruding on
others.


For diagnosis of ADHD, not only must individuals display at least six
of the symptoms associated with either inattention and/or impulsivity/
hyperactivity, but they must also meet the following criteria regarding
persistence, time of onset, pervasiveness, and severity. Persistence relates
to the length of sustained time an individual has exhibited symptoms of
inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. The DSM-IV requires that
symptoms be present for at least six months. Age of onset refers to the age
of the individual at which the behaviors were first evident. The DSM-IV
states that an individual must have displayed symptoms prior to seven

[p. <i>401</i>]

Thus, for diagnosis of ADHD, individuals must display at least six of
the symptoms of inattention and/or display at least six of the symptoms
of hyperactivity/impulsivity for at least six months in a developmentally
inappropriate manner. There are three possible subtypes:

 For the ADHD: Predominately Inattentive Type, individuals will
display symptoms of inattention but display less than six of the
hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms.


 For the ADHD: Predominately Hyperactive-Impulsive Type, individuals
will display symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity but display
less than six of the inattention symptoms.


 For the ADHD: Combined Type, individuals will display at least six
symptoms of inattention and six of the hyperactivity/impulsivity
symptoms.


Individuals with the Combined Type or Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive
Type have more behavioral and acting-out problems, whereas
those with the Predominately Inattentive Type seem to have more learning
problems and often qualify for learning disabilities programs.


School performance problems seem to characterize all students with
ADHD because the behaviors associated with ADHD interfere with a
student's productivity in school. In other words, students with ADHD may
fail not because they cannot do their schoolwork, but because they do not
finish their work and perform poorly on tests. In addition to production
problems, students with ADHD may have learning and/or serious behavioral
and emotional problems (McKinney et al., 1993). ADHD co-occurs with
learning disabilities in at least 10 percent to 20 percent of the students
when stringent identification criteria are applied for both conditions.
Students with ADHD and learning disabilities are often described as inattentive
and distractible, but not necessarily hyperactive. ADHD can also
co-occur with behavioral disorders. Approximately 30 percent to 50 percent
of these students are seriously aggessive, oppositionally defiant, or
conduct disordered. Students with ADHD who have serious emotional
problems may be withdrawn, depressed, moody, or anxious. Regardless
of the type of ADHD diagnosis, research has consistently reported that

[p. <i>402</i>]

ADHD is perhaps one of the most controversial developmental disorders
because the prevalence rate seems to be on the increase, the etiology is not
well understood, the diagnosis is subjective, and the treatments vary considerably.
One of the most controversial issues is the use of stimulant
medication with children (for example, Ritalin, Adderall). This chapter will
examine issues related to theoretical perspectives and current thinking about
ADHD, definitions and diagnostic criteria, assessment and identification
procedures, and treatment/intervention practices.


<b>THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES</b>


<b>Neuropsychological model</b>


Research at various centers, for example, The University of Virginia
(UVA) Health Sciences Center (2002a), is accruing scientific evidence
that ADHD is a biologically-based disorder and that the primary component
of ADHD, attention, is a neuropsychological function having a
strong genetic link.


Evidence supporting this view is accumulating through methodologies
and procedures, including anatomic studies, positron emission scanning,
blood flow analysis, clinical correlation studies, and ongoing twin studies.
The UVA Center (2002b) has developed a neurochemical model of ADHD
to more fully understand the effects of stimulant medication on the brain.
Stimulants have been very effective in alleviating the symptoms of ADHD
in many individuals. The thinking is that the medication modulates the
release and levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline,
and serotonin that are associated with various functions in the central nervous
system (CNS) and that presumably operate in an interrelated manner.


Based on knowledge of the locales of the brain in which these neurotransmitters
are influential in CNS functions, such as attention and response
inhibition and the clinical variation among individuals with ADHD,
researchers have posited a model of at least three ADHD subtypes that
suggest differential origins and possible differential pharmacological interventions.
At the risk of oversimplication, the first type, inattentive, is characterized
by impaired sensory filtering and cognitive processing. Dopamine
is the primary neurotransmitter for this function located in the right hemisphere
of the brain and the prefrontal cortex. The second type, hyper-aroused,
is characterized by abnormal levels of activity. Located near the
brain stem is the locus ceruleus, which is the norepinephrine containing

[p. <i>403</i>]

Barkley (1997) takes a different perspective by postulating ADHD not
as an attentional disorder, but rather as a behavioral inhibition disorder.
His theoretical perspective is also based on neuropsychological research,
but his interpretation of the research and conceptualization of the disorder
depart considerably from the traditional notions of ADHD as primarily an
attention deficit. He contends that, particularly, neuroimaging studies in
which certain parts of the brain are smaller and less active in individuals
with ADHD support this perspective. The research strongly suggests the
disorder results from abnormalities in the brain's prefrontal areas, particularly
the right orbital-prefrontal region, the executive functioning region
that presumably controls the ability to self-regulate. Barkley concluded
that deficits in this region may indeed be the source of ADHD.


In Barkley's Hybrid Model of Executive Functions, the prefrontal lobe
controls the ability to inhibit behavior, and this ability can be broken down
into four separable executive functions: nonverbal working memory,
verbal working memory, self-regulation of affect/motivation/arousal, and
reconstitution. All four functions are connected with a motoric response
system. A deficit in behavioral inhibition has to do with a delay in the
ability to internalize behavior to the extent that an individual can reflect
on the past, present, and future, that is, reflect on and appropriately inhibit
present responses based on consequences of past responses and the anticipation
of future activity. This inhibitory deficit leads to an inability to control
goal-directed motor behavior. The executive functions are negatively
affected, as evidenced by faulty neuropsychological functioning. Figure 25.1
lists the characteristics associated with each executive function.


Notwithstanding the differences in neuropsychological models, they
serve to provide an explanation of the etiology of ADHD, the characteristic
deficits associated with the affected regions of the brain, and the resulting
behaviors that interfere with functioning in school, at work, and at
home. Brain research promises not only explanations of behavior, however;
it also offers the promise of neurologically-based prevention and
intervention specific to the neurological dysfunctions that may be unique
to an individual with ADHD.


<b>Developmental model</b>


In contrast to earlier views of ADHD as a condition affecting young
children who typically outgrow the symptoms, the current view is that

[p. <i>404</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000013190-I0019&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />
[p. <i>405</i>]

Although one of the diagnostic criteria is the manifestation of symptoms
during early development, that is prior to seven years of age, some
individuals with ADHD are not identified until early adolescence when
they begin to fail in school. These youngsters may be described as predominately
inattentive, and their symptoms may have been overlooked or
compensated for during elementary school years. However, during
middle and senior high school, students are expected to be responsible.
Self-control or the ability to self-regulate behavior is associated developmentally
with early adolescence. These individuals are characteristically
described as inattentive, distractible, disorganized, and inefficient (Robin,
1998). These behaviors generally persist into adulthood and may adversely
affect academic, social, and occupational performance. In sum, it is important
to understand ADHD from a developmental perspective, as well as to
understand the cognitive demands and expectations associated with each
developmental stage.


<b>ASSESSMENT AND IDENTIFICATION
PROCEDURES</b>


As with all childhood disorders, assessment of ADHD requires a comprehensive
and systematic evaluation. Assessment procedures and diagnostic
practices for identifying individuals with ADHD have undergone considerable
scrutiny by both researchers and clinicians. Historically, the most
controversial issue seems to be defining ADHD and reaching agreement
on the core symptoms. Operationalizing severity and duration as well
as pervasiveness also has been problematic. Furthermore, the social
adjustment, cognitive abilities, and educational needs of youngsters with
ADHD have been a primary concern, especially for educators (McKinney
et al., 1993). More recently, as a result of new developments in the field,
researchers have focused on crucial issues such as diagnostic classification
and co-morbidity and assessment modality, that is the use of single

[p. <i>406</i>]

<b>Diagnostic classification and co-morbid
disorders associated with ADHD</b>


A major purpose of diagnostic classification is to organize a wide range
of research and clinical findings into a manageable and coherent set of
constructs that will facilitate communication about an individual. As
previously indicated, in the text revision of the fourth edition of the DSM-IV-TR
(APA, 2000), three subtypes of ADHD were delineated: ADHD-Predominately
Inattentive Type; ADHD-Predominately Hyperactive/
Impulsive Type; and ADHD-Combined Type. The DSM-IV-TR specifies
the number of symptoms that must be endorsed to establish diagnostic criteria.
To reiterate, in order to make a diagnosis of the specific type, a clinician
must assess the presence of six out of a possible nine inattention
and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms for at least six months.


This diagnostic practice, although widely used, has been the object of
much criticism. One main point of contention is that such an approach
assigns all symptoms similar weight and provides clinicians and researchers
with no guidance with respect to which symptoms or behaviors are the best
indicators and predictors of ADHD. For example, the behavioral indicator
often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in
schoolwork, work, or other activities has the same weight as often has difficulties
organizing tasks and activities (APA, 2000). Another point of contention
is how to gauge the severity of the symptoms. The DSM-IV-TR fails
to address this question directly, leaving severity open to interpretation.
Moreover, the symptoms must be present for at least 6 months to a degree
that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level (APA, 2000:
83). The diagnostician is left with no assistance as to what degree of maladaptive
behavior or to what extent a behavior should be discrepant from
normal developmental level in order to meet diagnostic criteria. Power,
Costigan et al. (2001) recommended operationalizing the criteria with
emphasis on determining the frequency with which a behavior needs to
occur in order to qualify as a symptom, the optimal number of endorsed
symptoms (for predicting and for ruling out a diagnosis) for each informant,
and the ideal approach to combine symptoms from different informants. A
diagnostic approach that establishes a set of diagnostic criteria in order to
establish the presence or absence of a disorder is commonly considered a
categorical approach to assessment. With this approach, the individual
either meets the necessary criteria for categorization or does not.

[p. <i>407</i>]

This approach is contrasted with the dimensional approach that
provides an assessment of emotional, behavioral, and learning problems
along a gamut from average to unusual. There is no clear delimitation of the
boundary between normal and atypical behavior. In general, dimensional
approaches specify the severity of the child's difficulties on each of several
important dimensions of functioning which, in turn, have been operationalized
by using such assessment tools as behavior rating scales. Two popular
scales are the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach, 1991a) and
the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) (Reynolds and
Kamphaus, 1992). This approach relies on the richness of the information
obtained about the extent and type (for example, internalizing and externalizing)
of behaviors and allows for more comprehensive treatment planning.
In this respect, an increasing number of researchers and clinicians are
approaching the assessment and treatment of ADHD in an integrated fashion
where functional and diagnostic assessments are integrated to allow for
flexible decisions based on student and family strengths and needs.


Another critical aspect of ADHD, in general, and of categorical
approaches, in particular, is the issue of co-morbidity with other childhood
psychiatric disorders. Prevalence rates vary considerably, but it is
well acknowledged that ADHD co-exists with other disorders to a significant
degree. For instance, Kaplan et al. (2001) estimated the overlap
between ADHD and reading problems to be somewhere in the 35 percent
to 50 percent range and to co-exist with language impairments in about
45 percent of the cases. In the same fashion, Sattler (2002) estimated that
ADHD overlaps with learning disorders in the 25 percent to 50 percent
range, 35 percent with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), 26 percent
with conduct disorder (CD), 18 percent with depressive disorder and
26 percent with anxiety disorder. The validity of the notion of co-morbidity
has been questioned, and some have even suggested that in real life the
discreet categories proposed by the DSM-IV-TR do not exist. In line with a
dimensional approach to assessment, researchers have suggested using the
term atypical brain development as an underlying impairment that may
manifest with different and often overlapping symptoms (Kaplan et al.,
2001). While this position may seem appealing, one should not miss the
importance of diagnostic classifications in facilitating a better understanding
of an individual's behavior, in facilitating communication about the
individual, and in providing a framework for assessment and treatment.


<b>Assessment modality</b>


In addition to inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity, children with
ADHD commonly display a number of associated deficits. Among these

[p. <i>408</i>]

One explanation for these discrepancies is associated with the diversity
of sources from which the reported data come. For example, while some
clinicians base their ADHD diagnoses on information given solely by
parents, others may use clinical interviews of children and teachers' ratings.
To complicate matters further, data from multiple sources may vary with
respect to the degree and severity of described behaviors (Crystal et al.,
2001). Yet, for the most part, it is fairly well established that multiple source
data generally yield more reliable diagnoses. Despite this knowledge, few
research studies collect multiple source data (for example, parent and
teacher ratings), and even in studies that do, other methodological problems,
that is, small sample size, lead to questionable results (Crystal et al., 2001).


An exception is a large-scale study conducted by Crystal et al. (2001)
with children in grades one through four (n = 453) to examine ADHD subtypes
as defined by the DSM-IV. They used multiple reporting sources as
well as multiple instruments. Parents and teachers completed questionnaires
and were also interviewed. One would expect to find similar distribution
as the field trials in the DSM-IV across ADHD subtypes. However,
the results were quite different. Crystal et al. (2001) found that only 5 percent
of the children in their study were classified as ADHD-Hyperactive/
Impulsive Type as compared with 18 percent in the DSM field trials, and
52 percent as ADHD-Inattentive Type as compared with only 27 percent
in the DSM field trials.

[p. <i>409</i>]

The researchers argued that these discrepancies could have been due to
the sample demographics. That is, the study used a school-based sample
as opposed to DSM's clinical sample; also, the children were primarily
middle-class. Additionally, children under six years of age were not included,
in contrast to the DSM-IV trials, which included a significant number of
preschoolers (Crystal et al., 2001). This study supports the hypothesis that
source (that is, parents, teachers, interviews with children) leads to measurement
variance, which can produce significantly different descriptions
of DSM-IV ADHD subtypes. Parents perceived the ADHD-Combined
group as having significantly more conduct problems and hyperactivity
than the ADHD-Inattentive group. Interestingly, teachers did not rate these
subtypes differently. Parents also gave significantly higher ratings of
inattention to the Combined group on the CBCL than to the Inattentive
group, whereas these differences were not reflected on the BASC. Another
interesting finding has to do with the differential roles of inattention and
hyperactivity in distinguishing between a comparison group and children
with ADHD. Previous studies indicated hyperactivity as an informative
predictor of ADHD group membership (DuPaul, Anastopoulos et al., 1998).
In this study, aggression rather than hyperactivity appeared to be the most
salient distinction between the Combined and the Inattention subtypes
(Crystal et al., 2001).


The implications of this study are threefold. First, misdiagnosis may
continue to occur as long as stringent clinical criteria are used to diagnose
non-clinical groups who may present a different range of behaviors.
Second, at the very least, these results call attention to the importance
and the caveats of using multi-method assessments in researching and
classifying children. Finally, the study highlights the diagnostic difficulties
in differentiating between different types of disruptive behaviors commonly
associated with ADHD. In summary, the use of multiple informants
and multiple instruments appears to be a relatively reliable yet not faultless
method to assess ADHD. While researchers seem to agree on this,
more studies are needed to clarify the equivocal findings and to assist
clinicians in making appropriate diagnoses that impact heavily on treatment
decisions.


<b>Assessment instruments</b>


The DSM-IV stipulates that in making decisions when diagnosing ADHD
it is important to consider the child's functioning in multiple settings, more
specifically in the school and home settings; however, the criteria do not
specify how to collect this information or how to use the information collected
for decision-making purposes. Moreover, a problem with many of

[p. <i>410</i>]

Assessment procedures typically include interviews, behavioral observations,
psychological tests and rating scales. Parent, child, and teacher
interviews generally provide information about the age of onset of the
disorder, the pervasiveness of the child's difficulties, the severity of
symptoms across settings, information about factors that interfere with
functioning in various settings (that is, home and school), and information
about how the child perceives his or her own behavior. Observations are
vital since these give the clinician information about antecedents and consequences
of disruptive behavior across settings, a requirement for diagnosis
according to the DSM-IV criteria. Even though there are no specific
tests or test batteries for determining the diagnosis of ADHD, most clinicians
include intelligence tests, achievement tests, memory tests and one
or more neuropsychological tests typically used to measure attention
and/or impulsivity. Intelligence and achievement tests are recommended
to assess cognitive strengths and weaknesses as well as areas of academic
achievement that may be affected by the disorder. Rating scales are useful
in obtaining information from parents, children and teachers. These are
easy to administer as well as time efficient and provide the clinician with
multiple points of view that may help identify appropriate and inappropriate
behaviors, including those associated with ADHD.


In general, there are two groups of scales: broad-band and narrow-band.
Broad-band scales, such as the CBCL (Achenbach, 1991b) and the BASC
(Reynolds and Kamphaus, 1992), survey a wide spectrum of symptoms
and behaviors (for example, externalizing, internalizing). Narrow-band
scales, such as the Conner's Rating Scales  Revised (Conners, 1997) and
the ADHD Rating Scales (DuPaul, Power et al., 1998), are designed
to measure behaviors associated with specific disorders (for example,
inattentiveness, depression) (Sattler, 2002).


It should be emphasized that nearly all of these scales have parent and
teacher versions, thus allowing for multi-setting assessment. Also, the
information provided by the broad-band scales in general tends to be quite
similar. For instance, a study of convergent and criterion-related validity
of the BASC-Parent Rating Scale (BASC-PRS) as compared to the CBCL
4-18 suggested that both instruments are comparable in predicting
membership in diagnostic grouping (for example, no diagnosis, ADHD only,
and ADHD with a co-morbid externalizing disorder) (Doyle et al., 1997).


In spite of the predictive validity of these widely used broad-band
scales, the quandary surrounding their lack of direct relation with the
DSM-IV ADHD diagnostic criteria remains unsettled. The ADHD Rating

<b>TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PRACTICES</b>


Because of the neurobiological nature of ADHD and its impact on individuals
across situations and settings, interventions tend to be both nonpharmacological
and pharmacological. Nonpharmacological treatment plans
typically include a range of strategies, including educational programs and
accommodation plans, positive behavior management programs, individual
or group counseling, family and parent education, and social skills training.
A shift in thinking has occurred over the past few years regarding the design
of comprehensive treatment plans for individuals with ADHD. First, professional
organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP,
1987) as well as researchers, psychologists, and counselors advocate a
multimethod, multi-informant, and multidisciplinary approach to treatment.
Second, rather than focus on the individual's deficits, emphasis is placed on
identifying the strengths of an individual and building on those strengths.
School accommodation plans should be multifaceted with specific strategies
for ensuring that teachers and other school staff communicate regularly
with parents about their children's program and that a similar reinforcement
program is operating at home. Parent involvement is vital to the overall success
of a comprehensive treatment program for youngsters with ADHD.


Pharmacological treatments, that is, stimulants, antidepressants, and
antihypertensives, are frequently a prime component of a comprehensive

[p. <i>412</i>]

As a consequence of numerous studies on the effects of medication, its
use has increased at a phenomenal pace. The past decade has seen not only
a rapid increase in the identification of individuals with ADHD (Davison,
2001), but also large increases in the use of medication with students, especially
those between 15 and 19 and between two and four years old (Zito
et al., 2000). At the same time, caveats and recommendations regarding the
use of medication have been issued by several professional organizations.
For example, the position of the National Association of School
Psychologists (NASP, 1995) is that instructional and behavioral interventions
should be tried out before medication is introduced into the treatment

[p. <i>413</i>]

<b>CONCLUSION</b>


In conclusion, there remain many unresolved issues and concerns in understanding,
assessing, and treating individuals with ADHD. This chapter
reviewed several of these issues from an historical and current perspective.
With advances in technology, particularly, future research should
continue to provide additional insight into the condition and further our
understanding of its etiology as well as its assessment, identification, and
treatment.
