<b>May 14</b>

A few reflections while I await a further session of the
treatment with, I may add, an increasing sense of anticipation.
The book which I dare to conceive of, and to which these
few scripts would serve as a foreword to the main, I will
probably dedicate--if my early suspicions and convictions prove
well-founded--to an exceptional physician who sowed good
wheat where before nothing would grow on such stony ground,
who provided me with grounds for hope and optimism where
before there was not, who led me by candlelight through a
procession of dark ages, and into an abundantly lit life--in short,
he redeemeth my soul and gave a dying man a motive for
living.
