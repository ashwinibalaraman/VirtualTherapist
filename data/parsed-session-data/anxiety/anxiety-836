BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: [Adjusting recorder] So [pauses] it has been a while.
CLIENT: You know, it is funny. I was thinking the last time I was here with Trae was when he was <i>really</i> little.
THERAPIST: He was just a...
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: He's got peach fuzz and everything now.
CLIENT: Oh, no — yeah.
THERAPIST: I can see chubby little legs.
CLIENT: I love those chubby legs.
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: I know. [Chuckles] Anyway, it is crazy — he's almost — he's three and a half months, almost four months now, which is just...
THERAPIST: Yeah, that <i>is</i> crazy.
CLIENT: ...Amazing. And he's starting to giggle now and just be so much more interactive, which is really fun. We got an awesome video of him two nights ago, just like belly laughing, which was so fun.
THERAPIST: [Clucks] Ohhh...
CLIENT: We sent it out to everybody.
THERAPIST: Well, I'm sure they love to getting it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And they're such — there's so much change and it is something...
CLIENT: It is amazing, like...
THERAPIST: ...Just three months.
CLIENT: Yeah! To think we keep — now, we're just obsessed with looking at the pictures of when he was first born, and it — just, even now, it is hard to remember...
THERAPIST: It is so drastic...
CLIENT: ...He was that <i>small</i>. It is really crazy.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I feel like it has just been so much fun. Like, it is - just so amazed to have this time to enjoy him. And now I'm already kind of thinking about when I go back to school and...
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:01:00]
CLIENT: I'm going to stand up and take the thing off here — um, and just, you know, whenever<br />
 I'm kind of feeling a little frustrated or something at home, like if nursing isn't going well or if it has just been a tough day...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...Or if he's not going down for a nap, it is like such a nice reminder to be like, "You know what? Just appreciate these days..."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Because pretty soon I'll be back and school, and it'll all just be so different.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Like, I just feel so lucky that I have this time with him, which is nice. Um, [pauses]...
THERAPIST: You have beautiful perspective, I think.
CLIENT: Well, I mean, just I keep thinking ahead and thinking, like, I'm really going to miss this time. It is great to just wake up...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...In the morning and think, "Oh, should we [Baby Trae begins to fuss] just go to the library or go to a park, or — what do we want to do?"
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So it is just fun to — [aside to baby] Let's take you up because I bet you're hot — um, to just have, like, the whole day to just kind of do fun stuff...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...When that's like that two of us, or go and see friends. [Aside to baby] You <i>were</i> hot in there, weren't you?
THERAPIST: It is a hot day to be dealing with, huh?
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles] Yeah.
THERAPIST: Only with him (ph).
CLIENT: [Chuckles] There he is.
THERAPIST: I'll try to focus on you.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] [00:01:59]
CLIENT: He's a little bit of a distraction. [Chuckles] So that has just been ni — like, I feel like it helps. Whenever I'm, like, "Oh, I'm ready for Todd (ph) to come home," or, "I wish my mom were here to give me a little help." But...
THERAPIST: It is also OK to feel like that sometimes.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: There is actually — I hardly ever tell people to go [slaps surface] look at, um, blogs or websites, but, um — [clucks] and I'm not going to remember the author, but I bet if you Googled a couple of words, you could find it — there was a really nice blog entry written by a mom — it was very written — that talked about, you know, this expectation that people say, like, "Ah! Enjoy this time," and...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...."I loved every single moment of parenting," and, "Isn't it wonderful?" And there certainly are those moments.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And she did just a really nice job of talking about how, sometimes, being in the moment maybe isn't so great because when they poop all over you, that's not actually that much fun.
CLIENT: Right. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Like, is he [going to throw up] (ph)? No! [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But there are moments where you wish you could be somewhere else sometimes, and then there are also these moments when you get this perspective where you feel like, "Ach, I just want to breathe in every moment" because it is so — it is so fleeting...
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:02:59]
THERAPIST: ...And so wonderful. So she makes this description between what she calls, I think, Chronos time and Kyros time. And I think if you go Google those two things...
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: ...With "parenthood" or something along with it...
CLIENT: Yeah?
THERAPIST: ...You might find it.
CLIENT: Oh, good.
THERAPIST: And it just — it really resonates with the way that you're talking about this. I think you might enjoy looking at it.
CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, good, I'll have to look for it.
THERAPIST: [Clucks] And if you can't find it, let me know, and I'll see if I can find it.
CLIENT: Oh, good.
THERAPIST: Because I remember reading it, and I have — you know, because I was trying to do that parent group. I had a lot of young parents in it...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And — or parents of young children. I think that it just really resonates with that — the way that you feel sometimes....
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And then also remembering that there are sometimes — and it is OK. You know, if you can't treasure every moment, that's OK.
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
THERAPIST: Because there are sometimes that it is not necessarily worth treasuring.
CLIENT: Exactly. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah. And I think it has helped. I've still been going to that mom's group.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I think I had gone once the last time I saw you. And that's been nice, too, 'cause it is just like everyone kind of goes around and shares a high point and a low point from their week.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And it just like everything that... [00:04:01]
THERAPIST: So it is kind of realistic, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. So it is reassuring to think, like, "Oh, she kind of has similar feelings to me, and it is nice that, like...
THERAPIST: Is that [clucks] at the birthing center you were going, or...?
CLIENT: [Clucks] No, this is different.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: It is through the Jewish Community — Jewish Services company (ph) or whatever.
THERAPIST: Oh, OK.
CLIENT: What it was — and open to everybody, and it is right off of [inaudible] Street. And it just happens every — Friday mornings.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: So there are usually, like, ten moms there, so...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, and you can just drop in whenever you want?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: So it has been really nice.
THERAPIST: Oh, I didn't know if you had done that yet...
CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, maybe not then.
THERAPIST: ...Since you were here last time.
CLIENT: So — but that was — so far, I have been three times, I think, so...
[Baby begins to fuss.]
THERAPIST: Well, that's [sometimes good work] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah, it is really nice. And then just to meet other moms...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...And just get connected. But...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...You know, moms of babies of similar ages has been really fun.
THERAPIST: Yep. Yeah, [clucks] 'cause so much <i>does</i> happen, and to be able to share some of this with other people that are sharing it at the same time is something really supportive.
CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. And I feel like it is also reassuring. Like, some of the worries that I have — like, I feel like now is nice. Like, I feel like there are some worries that I have, that I know are like, "These are normal worries over here." [00:05:05]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And it is OK, and so to hear other moms...
THERAPIST: Yes, you don't have to second-guess having them.
CLIENT: Yeah. It is just nice to be like, "OK, this isn't something that's me being — you know, perseverating on something."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, right.
CLIENT: Like worried about something that's not true. Like...
THERAPIST: Yeah, it is like just being [chuckles]...
CLIENT: ...A typical new mom, yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: So that's been nice.
THERAPIST: Yes, and you should have permission to be the typical new mom just like anyone else...
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
THERAPIST: ...Without being extra hard on yourself or [baby beings to fuss] not being totally zen. [Sniffles]
CLIENT: Right, exactly. And I do feel like I've been, like, <i>so</i> nervous about the sleeping — or not sleeping and not wanting that worry to come in again.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I actually did have a couple of nights in a row where they were not good nights, and it was like the first time since I've had him that that's happened.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, that you've had trouble.
CLIENT: And, of course, I was like, "Oh, no."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I think the last time I was talking to you, it has just been like this nice feeling of not having to worry about worrying about sleeping. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Because when I saw you last, you had come back from your trip... [00:06:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And you'd had, like, one night here or there, but it didn't...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...It didn't worry you that much 'cause you were able to...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Just kind of attribute it to whatever was going on at that moment and move on.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, and move on. And with this, I don't even know what it was. And that was like the only thing that kind of made me — I feel like I am able to differentiate between, like, worries that I know are just typical new mom worries...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ....And worries that I know are more like new to me.
THERAPIST: [Clucks] Like Chelsea's (ph).
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah. And those nights, I felt like were more like my kind of worries, where...
THERAPIST: What was going on in your head?
CLIENT: Yeah, I — I just didn't really know. Like, it was that kind of like not getting settled feeling that I would have before, where my head was kind of just like spinning.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I feel like it was, again, in that moment of searching for something to worry about, and I — and I hadn't felt that, and so along — and this was actually kind of like right after I saw you, so it was a while ago now.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: Like, I feel like it — it is hard even to kind of remember, especially since so much is a blur with him now. [00:07:00]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Um, but it was like that same feeling as before, of just like not getting myself settled in bed and just my head kind of spinning.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I almost felt like it was spinning in like a negative way, like looking for something...
THERAPIST: Yeah, to latch onto.
CLIENT: ...To worry about or to kind of doubt in myself, about like being a mom or just the way that I've been interacting with Trae during the — you know, just like on my own during the day, or like — and it was funny 'cause I could feel myself looking, and I wasn't coming up with anything....
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...But I wouldn't...
THERAPIST: ...Let go of it.
CLIENT: ...Let go. And it was kind of like a half asleep-half awake kind of thing, like I wasn't — like, when I woke up during the day, it was kind of weird to even think back to think, "Well, what was really keeping me awake?" But I know that I was...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...Awake and just kind of worried. And even like the next day when I woke up, it was kind of sticking with me just like this unsettled feeling of looking for [chuckles] something to worry about, I think.
THERAPIST: I — [chuckles]
CLIENT: Are you laughing at me? [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: I got a good smile (ph). I'm — I wonder what would have happened if you were able to say to yourself, "Yep, I'm feeling really uneasy right now..." [00:08:05]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ..."And I might just feel uneasy tonight,"...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And not necessarily <i>push</i> yourself to come up with something to justify the uneasy feeling.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.
THERAPIST: 'Cause it sounds like, when you're searching for something to worry about, you're — that's what you're trying to do; you're sort of trying to make — make your thoughts match what you're feeling.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And maybe sometimes you just feel uneasy, and there's not necessarily a reason.
CLIENT: I think, yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: And being able to let yourself be OK with that...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Like, "Yep, this is what I'm feeling."
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
[Baby begins to fuss a bit.]
THERAPIST: "Maybe it'll — maybe it'll be gone in the morning."
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Um, but I — you don't necessarily need to match it to something.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Sometimes, we do just have weird feelings and that's it. You know.
CLIENT: Right. And that's true because I think that's what I was trying to do. And it was the first time I'd felt like that in a long time.
THERAPIST: A long time?
CLIENT: And so, you know, that part of me felt good 'cause I was like — I think, in a way, I was, like, anticipating a night like this for so long that...
THERAPIST: Right, just lapsed (ph) at some point.
CLIENT: ...It was kind of nice to just have it. And then, actually, the next night, I didn't sleep very well, either, and I actually did get up and read that night. Um, and it took... [00:09:03]
THERAPIST: Did that work?
CLIENT: It did work, yeah, but part of me was struggling...
THERAPIST: So you can use that when you need to, but you don't have to use it all the time?
CLIENT: Right. And I was lying in bed thinking, "I really don't even want to get up," because then I don't want to have to get back into that routine...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...Of like having to read to get myself back to sleep, but I did 'cause then nothing else was really working.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And it did work.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I have...
THERAPIST: Gave your mind a place to go.
CLIENT: ...So — but yeah (ph).
THERAPIST: It gave your mind a place to go that wasn't [pauses] worrisome.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And just because you — I think, you know, doing it one night or doing that on a night when you're having a problem does not mean that you necessarily need to do it as part of your routine every night.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: It can be — the routine you have that's your sort of typical routine, which is the more streamlined version...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And then there's the set of skills that you have when you're having an issue.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And they don't have to be the same thing.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I think it is funny 'cause I think that night was one night when we got him to bed, like, earlier than usual...
THERAPIST: Yeah, [inaudible at 09:56]
CLIENT: ...So it is almost like I was in like this overdrive of my being with him until 11, until we would go to bed, where Todd and I, at night... [00:10:03]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Were totally focused on him and getting him to bed, and getting him down.
THERAPIST: Mm, [inaudible at 10:06]
CLIENT: ...And then we would go straight to bed and crash. Right. And so now it is almost like when we are home, he's...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...In bed. Like, we've been putting him to bed around nine or 9:30, he's been going to sleep, and we're just like...
THERAPIST: So you've actually had this time when you can be...
CLIENT: ..."Weird."
THERAPIST: ...A couple again.
CLIENT: Yeah. And it has been nice, but I do feel like, now, it is like — so that time of night almost feels like similar to when we had Trae, when I was like...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Before we had Trae, when I was needing to read and like do that kind of routine...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...To get myself to sleep.
THERAPIST: That's time to come up with something different to do during that time...
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: ...You know, rather than having to be all about your routine.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: What — finding a way to sort of capture that time in a way that fits for you now.
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses] Yeah, and I think it is interesting because I really think that it was kind of what promoted it, like it was just like I was — I didn't even have to worry about going to sleep because we were so focused on him.
THERAPIST: [And you'd been working so hard] (ph). [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] And so tired, right.
[Crosstalk]
THERAPIST: [Your child was telling you] (ph)...
CLIENT: [...More sleep, when I think of it.] [chuckles]
THERAPIST: By the time you could go to bed, that's all you... [00:11:03]
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
THERAPIST: So what — what do — now that — 'cause I think you're going to reclaim even more time. I mean, as he gets older...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...His bedtime is going to get pushed back further.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Um, or pushed sooner...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And you'll actually have more evening to yourself.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So what <i>do</i> - ? This is your time to sort of be proactive and decide what are you going to <i>do</i> with that time?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What do you <i>want</i> it to be filled with?
CLIENT: Right. And it is nice 'cause we're still trying to figure out, like, nine or 9:30 hasn't — we haven't really had dinner <i>after</i> that yet, but...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: ...But Todd and I are looking forward to having an earlier bedtime...
THERAPIST: [Do a little bit of] (ph)...
CLIENT: ...To just like have dinner. 'Cause now it is even almost harder because before, when he was even younger and going to bed <i>way</i> later..
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: ...We could kind of eat when he was taking a nap or something.
THERAPIST: Right, taking a nap or...
CLIENT: Um, but now it is like we're shoveling the food in to, like, feed him right after, and so it is like — kind of that was a time when we would always reconnect during — from a busy day, together before Trae was born.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And we still kind of had that a little when he was a little newborn. [00:11:59]
THERAPIST: Right. Mm-hmm, but now it is — the timing is, like, just wrong.
CLIENT: And now I feel like he's losing that. Yeah. So he [might still a point to] ph...
[Crosstalk]
THERAPIST: So you may — you might try doing sort of like an apps-type thing before his bedtime...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...So that you're not starving...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And then being able to use that after time to have a more leisurely dinner, part two.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah, to just give us — give ourselves some time.
THERAPIST: Yeah, to actually sort of sit [slaps surface] across from one another or next to one another.
CLIENT: Well [exhales], and to talk to each other and not have a baby in our arms, and — so I — I do think, now, we're just kind of in, like, that transition around his bedtime.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: That's making the nighttimes feel unsettled 'cause we're just not sure when...
THERAPIST: Yeah, the whole routine...
CLIENT: ...Will he go down, and when is his last feeding going to be, and things like that. So [pauses] yeah, but I don't — I almost was thinking, like, way back to before, um — [clucks] like, right before Todd and I got engaged, and I knew, like, we would be getting engaged soon and...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...It was almost like that same kind of thing, like searching for something to worry about in our relationship.
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:12:59]
CLIENT: And this is like — this relationship that I have, that I knew was like this beautiful thing that I loved, that we had between the two of us, and I — and this was a long time ago now, like we got engaged in 2007, but I remember that feeling of kind of like searching and, like, looking back...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Like, with even — like silly things that don't even make sense, I was letting myself think...
THERAPIST: Try to make [worrying with] (ph) them.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Like, my mom and my real dad, um, Colin — like, my dad ended up cheating on my mom, and that kind of led to their divorce when I was, you know, a newborn. But part of me was thinking like a ridiculous thought, like, "What if that is like from my dad, like, ends up in me?" Like, would I ever have the capability of doing something like that?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Or like kind of searching for these things that were <i>totally</i> out there, like I <i>knew</i> were crazy thoughts but...
THERAPIST: Right, it is almost feeling like something that you weren't in [inaudible at 13:51]...
[Crosstalk]
CLIENT: Yeah, but letting myself think that. Or even like, "What if, you know, one day I realize, like, I'm a lesbian and I'm in the wrong [chuckles] relationship."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:13:59]
CLIENT: Like, these things that aren't — tot — that are totally not <i>me,</i> but I must be letting myself think of these crazy thoughts [to tell] (ph)...
THERAPIST: Well, you're searching for 'what ifs."
CLIENT: Yeah. And so it was almost like catching myself with this — like, I feel like, now, here I have another kind of beautiful relationship that I'm growing with Trae, but it was like, again, that moment of [pauses]...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Of like kind of searching for something to doubt.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And it was kind of the only way I could, you know, equate it to something outside of experience.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: You know, and I — and as soon as I realized that, I was like — I was doing everything I could to stop thinking that 'cause I don't want to, like, tarnish this val (ph)...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Like, I don't want to be thinking that at all.
THERAPIST: Well, did it tarn — did those 'what ifs' tarnish your relationship with Todd?
CLIENT: No, not at all. But — and I was able to talk with Todd about it, 'cause I was like, "Listen to these crazy thoughts I'm having."
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: "Like, this is <i>crazy</i>." And I was even talking to my mom about it back then 'cause I was so — I just surprised myself that I was even <i>thinking</i> like that.
THERAPIST: Yeah. What do you think the purpose was? [00:14:59]
CLIENT: I think, then, it was — yeah, like I — I think I was probably just having no — like, anticipating that we would get engaged soon, and knowing that it was the right thing, and I was 100 percent for it...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...But, like, that it would be a huge change, and kind of making sure that I was covering <i>every</i> single possible base to make sure that, like, [pauses] it was the right thing.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I think. 'Cause I've thought a lot about it past — like, since then, like, why I was doing that to myself.
THERAPIST: Right. Did you have a similar process when you were deciding to try to get pregnant?
CLIENT: [Clucks] No.
THERAPIST: Huh.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I wonder what made that different, 'cause that's another...
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: ...Sort of big life change.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I didn't. Like, I think I was a little just worried about the logistics of, like, school and stuff.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And Todd and I had talked a lot before...
THERAPIST: So the real things to worry about.
CLIENT: That's true. I know, yeah. Maybe that's what it was...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...That there were these real things that we could have conversations with and just kind of talking off to him about his process as a doctoral student and, like, if I have a baby in the middle, what do you think that would have been like for you to finish up all these milestones that I'll have. [00:16:04]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like, so it was more logistical...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Big conversations that we were having. But I never let myself — I never even — yeah, I didn't really...
THERAPIST: You never really questioned becoming a mom...
CLIENT: ...Get into that. Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...You're trying to become a mom.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You just questioned what the timing would be like.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And so I think it was — it was funny 'cause it was just like this little span, like it was like two days of just feeling like that [taps surface] unsettled, you know, feeling. And then I think it helps because we'd been up and down [taps surface] to Canada a bunch of times.
THERAPIST: Did you? I was wondering sort of what stopped it.
CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that's what it was. I can't even remember now like what days it was, but I think we were headed up, um, to Canada, so I just like got into a different situation and was able to let go.
THERAPIST: And your mind shifted, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
[Baby begins to fuss]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Is the baby all right (ph)?
CLIENT: [Aside to baby] {I don't even know if you're crying or laughing] (ph). [Chuckles]
[Baby fusses/coos.]
THERAPIST: [Quietly chuckles]
CLIENT: And so that made me feel better, too, 'cause I think I <i>have</i> been kind of dreading that night of not being able to sleep and having to get up and read... [00:17:04]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...And I had it, and then I had another one like that, and then I was still able to get it...
THERAPIST: And you were able to [get it] (ph)?
CLIENT: ...Past it.
THERAPIST: Yeah, so you sort of — kind of confronted your fear...
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And realized that it wasn't really as powerful as you were afraid it was.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. So I think it did feel good.
THERAPIST: You trust yourself just a <i>little</i> bit more.
CLIENT: Right. And I was, like, thinking a lot about that. Like, we've been talking about [sound of sticks striking] needing [taps surface] to trust myself more and thinking, like, "That's probably all stemming from it."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: You know, even back like before Todd and I got engaged was I kind of doubting myself and how I would be...
THERAPIST: Right. Well, that's [inaudible at 17:36]...
[Crosstalk]
CLIENT: ...You know, a partnership as a wife, and now I'm doubting myself — yeah — you know, thinking of myself in this role as a new <i>mom.</i>
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I don't feel like — it is funny 'cause it was like a <i>passing</i> thing, like it hasn't been weighing me down, but...
THERAPIST: Well, you have — I mean, it does sound like you're letting yourself, um, see evidence that before you used to seek out, and you would gain confirmation that it was really true.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right? Like you would check in with Todd, like, "Do I really need to worry about this?" and you were kind of waiting for him to tell you whether or not what you knew was really true. And it sounds like - you know, by going to the new moms' group, um, being able to check — kind of check on yourself, noticing like Trae is gaining weight — you have this evidence that you're doing your job... [00:18:16]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Um, or that you're thinking similarly to other people that are doing the same things...
CLIENT: Yeah.
[Baby begins to fuss a bit.]
THERAPIST: ...And you're letting yourself take that in. [Baby fusses] [Aside to baby] I — I know. They usually pay a lot of attention to you, I bet.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Do you agree? [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Softly] He's saying, like, "Usually, when there's a new person, they pay a lot of attention to me." [Chuckles]
CLIENT: That's right. What's going on? [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Um, but you're letting yourself take in this kind of information from the environment and — and trust it...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Like, in maybe ways that you didn't back then.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Or maybe there wasn't as much visible evidence in things like...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...How do you know your relationship is right? You've really got to just trust your gut on that. There's not a whole lot of evidence, um — you know? — to tell you that that's true, but you <i>do</i> have some — you know, some evidence with Trae.
CLIENT: Right. I know that's...
THERAPIST: And there are some other ways to kind of gauge it. [00:19:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
[Baby coos/fusses for a few moments]
CLIENT: [Aside to baby, softly] [Chuckles] Do you agree?
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I think that's true, that it <i>is</i> nice to — here's the proof that, like, we're doing a good job!
THERAPIST: Yeah, mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, we're figuring it out. Like, we have our moments, and — but it is nice [taps surface] to know that, you know, we can see that...
THERAPIST: He's growing and developing.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you — it seems like you feel pretty comfortable in the role.
CLIENT: Yes. Yeah, I do. Like, I — [taps surface] — and it wasn't — it was just a funny feeling, like it wasn't like I was feeling like, "Oh, my gosh, I don't trust myself," or like I'm — I don't like being home alone with him; like, it was none of those feeling, not — just...
THERAPIST: [Mm, feeling just] (ph) [inaudible at 19:37].
CLIENT: Yeah, it was weird. And then I ended up getting my period for the first time right after...
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: ...And I wondered if it was, like, related to that at all, too.
THERAPIST: It totally could be.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, you're — absolutely, your body is going through a lot of changes.
CLIENT: I feel like — I know...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...That it is just like all of these hormones and — yeah.
THERAPIST: It is something. I don't think [pauses] — it — I would think that it plays a role.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Even just being more sensi — just even if you're just more sensitive to things. [00:20:01]
CLIENT: [Drums on surface] Right.
THERAPIST: That maybe [clinking sound] previously you would have kind of — just kind of sailed past or that were hard for you...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Um, I think — you know, the way other hormones are involved would have — not just getting your period but menstruating for the first time after you've had a baby...
CLIENT: Right. [Continues drumming on surface]
THERAPIST: Well, yeah... [chuckles]
CLIENT: They're probably...
THERAPIST: They could probably impact your emotions. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, 'cause I definitely — like, there — every once in a while, I'll have, like — there've been a couple of nights like trouble getting to sleep, and then I'll be fine, or like waking up to feed him and a little trouble getting back to sleep, but then being fine.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So it — there have been little spurts since then but nothing that — like that, that really felt like, "Awh! It is that same feeling I've had before." Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, it doesn't sound like it was nearly as intense.
CLIENT: No. Yeah.
THERAPIST: And also just the fact that you can feel it for two days and [slaps surface] not feel it.
CLIENT: Exactly, yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: We'll give you some credit for that.
CLIENT: OK. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Uhh...
THERAPIST: Anything else we should catch up on or...? [00:20:56]
CLIENT: I think that was like the biggest thing, just wanting to talk more about — [baby begins to fuss] — about those, like, kind of two days and — and it is <i>sooo</i> — I still feel myself going to sleep now — or before going to sleep and thinking, like, "Oh, I hope this is another good night," and...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And Todd is a little bit more aware now, too, like, since those two nights where I had trouble sleeping. [Baby fusses]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: He's funny, too. Like, you know, helping me with just, like...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: "We're just going to bed. Do not think about anything. Like, let's just go to bed." [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Mm.
[Baby fusses]
CLIENT: So it is nice to know, like, he's been trying to be supportive about that, too.
THERAPIST: Yes, to [support you] (ph). Yeah.
CLIENT: [Taps surface] Yeah. And then it is like —then the other side of it is, well, when I wake up, and we're tired from like feeding him or, you know, being up with him in the middle of the night...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Then I think, "Well, it is just such a nice feeling that I was up for legitimate reasons. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Like, I could have myself up [inaudible at 21:43] (ph).
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: I know. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: What is his — how — what is your schedule at night? How often are you having to wake up at night (ph)?
CLIENT: Well, now he's doing really well. Now, if we put him down like around nine or 9:30 — but this is kind of new, within the past couple of weeks that we've been trying this earlier bedtime — but he's usually getting us up around, like, four or 5:30 for a feeding. [00:22:02]
THERAPIST: Oh, so that's a really long stretch.
CLIENT: And then he'll go back to sleep and then wake up.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But now — like, the past couple of nights, he's had us up a little bit more, and my friends have been talking about the four-month...
THERAPIST: The four-month [sleep regression] (ph)? Yeah.
[Crosstalk]
CLIENT: [inaudible at 22:12] regression (ph). So [pauses] we're, like, <i>so</i> afraid that's what's going to happen, but...
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: ...I feel like we have a good attitude about it.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Like, when we wake up in the morning, we're like, "Oh, we had a good night. It is nice that we had a good night. We might not have it again [baby begins to fuss] tonight." Like, [baby cries out] - but we're still figuring it out, so...
THERAPIST: Obviously, he if he does have — if he does start to wake a little bit more frequently, it — there's nothing — yeah, he will.
CLIENT: Yeah, [pauses] right.
THERAPIST: And then he will go back to his pattern, so...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Um, [clucks] you can't — you know, you — it doesn't do you any good to negatively anticipate it.
[Baby fusses a bit]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: It may or may not happen.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like, yes, some kinds, you know, have a growth spurt, which is what prompts them to want to feed more...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.
THERAPIST: ...um, and some kids don't. Some kids have it at four months and some kids have it at five...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [Baby fusses]
THERAPIST: ...So he may [inaudible at 22:54] doesn't sleep.
CLIENT: You never know. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: You never know what's going to happen. I liked to say mine couldn't have had a regression because they never slept for more than [baby squeals] [inaudible at 23:00], so... [Chuckles] [00:23:00]
CLIENT: Really?
THERAPIST: So I didn't notice it.
CLIENT: Oh, really? Oh, my gosh! Wow. [Drums surface]
THERAPIST: [Clucks] You know, you — you don't know what you're going to have, so you just go day by day.
CLIENT: Yeah. It is funny, like, "Welp, today will be an experiment."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Like, he's down at nine o'clock. Let's see what happens.
THERAPIST: ...What happens. And I think it is a lovely perspective to have [slaps surface]...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Because he's not putting pressure on you, and you're not putting pressure on him.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And you can enjoy the nights where you get a good stretch and...
CLIENT: Yeah, really wake up and look at the clock, and I'm like, "Oh, my gosh!" [Chuckles]
[Baby coos]
THERAPIST: Yeah, and the other thing to — if it changes, if he does — you know, if you don't get that big stretch the next night [baby begins to cry], it doesn't necessarily mean that you're not going to get one the next — right after that.
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
THERAPIST: Like, it might just be — just like you have one bad night.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: He might just have one night where he needs to see you more often.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Aside to baby] Right? Yeah.
CLIENT: [Whispers aside to baby] There's lots of new things to look at, huh? [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah, it is a pretty boring office from a baby perspective.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles] There's [a picture right here] (ph).
THERAPIST: Not a lot of bright colors. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you're doing well. I'm not going to attempt to do a relaxation with you 'cause you can't relax.
CLIENT: It might be a little hard. I know.
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles] [00:24:00]
THERAPIST: You can't let your body go limp right now.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah, I don't think so. [Chuckles] But that has been helpful at night, too, just trying to...
THERAPIST: [Clucks] Yeah, you do that when you don't have a baby in your arms.
CLIENT: ...Um, [release that] (ph) a little bit. Yeah. And with him 'cause he — because he's so alert now, sometimes nursing, I've noticed that he's just like looking around with, like, my nipple still in his mouth...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, checks stuff out.
CLIENT: ... [Baby begins to fuss] And kind of like moving his head around.
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Yeah.
CLIENT: So I've been trying to do, like, breathing with him to — to try and calm him down a little bit, so...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, [clucks] yeah. There has actually been some research about that. If you can do — that he will actually mimic your breath pattern.
CLIENT: Oh, really?
THERAPIST: Um, so if — if you do feel like, you know, he's being really alert at a time when you want him to be more calm...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...There's been — there's been some research that shows that, um, infants could pick up on their mothers' breathing patterns or whoever is their primary caregiver.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Um, and just — if you intentionally take longer, slower, deeper breaths, that he will also take longer, slower, deeper breaths.
CLIENT: Huh.
THERAPIST: And he won't match yours, obviously, because his body is so much smaller...
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
THERAPIST: ...But he will settle into a pattern that's more kind of symbiotic to yours, so... [00:25:03]
CLIENT: Huh, yeah.
[Baby cries out.]
CLIENT: Did you hear (ph) that? [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: So you can kind of relax both of you at the same time.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And see — you know, see what happens.
CLIENT: Yeah, we should definitely try that then, [baby fusses] because I have noticed a little bit of a difference. Sometimes, he's just like, you know, too distracted by everything...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...But, sometimes, it does work to just try and calm myself down a little bit more, too.
THERAPIST: And you can also, you know, just — because he <i>is</i> so much more alert now and picking up on things in the environment...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ....You might need to — you know, when you're nursing, you might need to sort of pick dimming the lights, sitting in a room where there is not as much activity, and things like that.
CLIENT: Yeah, mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Um, you know, when they're really little, you can [release them] (ph) in [taps surface] — you know, in a roomful of kids playing, and you don't care what...
[Crosstalk]
CLIENT: Right, and it is fine. Yeah.
THERAPIST: But now he's probably interested in what else is going on.
CLIENT: Exactly.
THERAPIST: Um...
CLIENT: Yeah, it was funny — before, like, I've nursed him in a <i>bar</i> before. You know, like, it was fine...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And now I'm like — my cousins were over yesterday, and I was like, "I'm going to have to go into his room to feed him," 'cause I could not get him to just, like, pay attention.
THERAPIST: Right, because he wants to listen to the voices and look around and... [00:26:01]
CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah, it is funny. But I don't blame him; there was lots going on yesterday. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Lots of interesting things. Well — and that particular nursing session is no longer as important — right? — because he...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Now because he is — he's got more body weight to sustain him.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: If he has a — you know, a session where he eats less or if he skips a session...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...He can make it a lot longer than he used to.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So if there is something that seems more interesting than food right now — you know, when he was one month old, there was really nothing much more interesting than that. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Right. Yeah, exactly, that's true. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: But you've got a little bit more flexibility.
CLIENT: Yeah, and it is so reassuring now, like, just to like see his little thighs and...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, you can check that out and know he's OK. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: It is OK if he didn't do, like, the full amount he usually does. Like, it is nice to have that worry away.
THERAPIST: He's got a little bit more leeway now.
CLIENT: Yeah, definitely.
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you guys are doing a great job.
[Sound of thumping]
CLIENT: Thanks. [Aside to baby] We've been having fun.
[Baby coos]
THERAPIST: [To baby] It was good to see you, Trae.
CLIENT: You did a good job, Trae. I wasn't sure how this would be. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah, he's probably still got a few more months where he can come.... [chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: ...If he has to. [00:26:57]
