BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Hello. 
CLIENT: Hello. [Pauses] Um [pauses for eight seconds] someone (ph) takes really good care, like really good care [inaudible at 00:23] [barely audible mumble] um, I was—because it occurs that it was clear that his cat (ph) has to eat something and [pauses] [shifts in seat] it was also clear that I just could not do any of it. Um, I wanted to [inaudible at 00:00:47] there's something wrong there, and I can't figure it out. Um, [pauses for six seconds]—yeah, I feel bad he does so much for me. [00:01:02] 
THERAPIST: That he does so much for you?
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 
CLIENT: Right. Um, [pauses for seven seconds] yeah, that shifts in seat] he has to do so much for me. 
CLIENT: Mm. [Silence for a few seconds] Yeah, not a good balance. Um, because then anything that he's upset with has enormous weight where it ordinarily would not necessarily. Like, if he gets irritated, it is a huge deal for me, and that's [shifts in seat] [inaudible at 02:01] nervous. [00:02:01]
THERAPIST: Oh. 
CLIENT: I find it very hard to even think about what's going on there or, certainly, to talk about it. [Pauses for five seconds] Yeah, and [then Tim will have time] (ph) and I really, really hate to [barely audible mumble] [inaudible at 02:34] being there. [Pauses for 28 seconds] [00:03:00]
We were driving to our friends' house on—next Saturday—Sunday, on Sunday. I was talking about the move (ph) that we've been talking about the last couple of weeks, and [he acts like news] (ph) and, "The most you've told me about Ethan in, like, ever, and I kind of feel like you're using me as therapy to work on your relationship with your therapist. So does stuff like that happen?"
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] And I was like, "I—hmm." [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Huh. Um, what about your relationship with your therapist were you working on with?
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Well, I didn't feel like I was doing that at all. [Chuckles] Um, but I'm not going to say he's wrong. Um, [pauses] [sighs]—I don't remember, actually. [00:04:03] 
THERAPIST: Hmm. 
CLIENT: Maybe I was starting that—uh, [pauses] you know, talking about my childhood and [pauses]—eh, how that seemed like it was something that I need to do, and I was reluctant, and so on and so forth, and, um, [pauses] that shifts in seat]—[pauses] trying very hard to shut down the part of my brain that says, "You're not making sense, and you need to do better." [Chuckles] 
THERAPIST: I see. 
CLIENT: [Chuckles] 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 
CLIENT: Uh-huh. [Pauses] [shifts in seat] Um, [pauses] I don't know what to do about that. [00:05:05]
[Silence for eight seconds]
THERAPIST: Well, I guess something's making you pretty anxious. Um...
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah. [Pauses for 26 seconds] Yeah. [00:05:57]
THERAPIST: And, um, [pauses for six seconds] I guess it sounds like, uh, [pauses] with both James and me, it involves doing things that are scary and difficult. With him [pauses for 11 seconds], it sounds like what you're contemplating is either asking him to do less, which would be difficult, probably, in one way but easier in another, or tolerating all that he is doing, which is easier and, the other way, difficult and, you know...
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:07:00]
[Silence for seven seconds]
THERAPIST: Um, where, with me, [pauses for five seconds] I guess, getting back into some stuff about your job you're anticipating, then, will be pretty exciting. 
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I'm—[pauses] I'm not aware that I find it very scary, but I'm trying to (ph) acting as though I find it very scary, um, which is strange to me. [Pauses] Yeah. 
THERAPIST: And, I guess, all around in this is a kind of, um, [pauses for three seconds]—I think a kind of fallibility that it is difficult for you to acknowledge. [00:08:12]
CLIENT: [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: You acknowledge, like, your fallibilities and frailties, and very readily; I'm not saying that...
CLIENT: No. 
THERAPIST: ...You're, you know, generally trying to kill (ph) that or move away from it, but [pauses], uh, [pauses] when it comes to dealing with some of this stuff with James or, I guess, with your history, [pauses]...
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: ...I guess that's what you wanted to feel like you were climbing on top of or...
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah, [inaudible at 08:57] yeah, yeah. But I [pauses]—I didn't want to feel like I understand and am OK with James's and my relationship. [00:09:12]
I think that's been kind of something I can count on, and it is [pauses]—things are different or I don't—or I think the same, and I'm realizing that I don't understand what I'm—what I did or...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: ...And it is very unsettling to me to be—feel like I am playing you two off of one another...
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: ...Because I'm trying not to put you in analogous categories, like very apart. [Chuckles] But there's no way that you cannot be, like—you know, you are the two people who are really supporting me, um, and—yes, saying that makes me feel slightly better about, um, [pauses] [sighs]... [00:10:00]
THERAPIST: What are you so worried about, with that?
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] I'm worried about being disloyal to anyone. Uh, [pauses] and I guess I'm worried about being disloyal to you. Um...
THERAPIST: Mm. 
CLIENT: You know, uh, [pauses] in the same way that I worry that you won't understand James, or that what I tell you about James will make you think of him as something different than he actually is. I worry that, when I talk about you to James, that he will not be supportive or will not understand it, or—yeah. Um, that's probably a little more—there is no grounding for that ladder. [00:11:04]
Um, [pauses]—uh... [clears throat] and that pauses]—you know, I told him that you had said, "We're relatively early in this process," and he was like, "What?" [Chuckles] He was like, "What is that guy doing?" [Chuckles] Like... 
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] 
CLIENT: And it is just like—and he's just like digging around. [Chuckles] 
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] 
CLIENT: I don't—he's not said even anything close to those words in terms of what he said, but that was pretty much how I think his thought process was going. Um [chuckles]—and so I don't really have—I don't really know what's going on, and so then to be [pauses] trying to talk about it with James, I feel like I'm in the position of trying to defend it and say, "Like, no, this is something good," and [pauses]—you know, we're both—now, we're both changing our lives in pretty enormous ways, so that I can keep coming here. [00:12:16] 
Um, and [pauses for five seconds]—and James's been pretty clear that that—at other times, that he really supports this, and he [digs a pall] (ph) at me, and that this is what we need to be doing, and that he feels good about doing it. 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: But [pauses] [sighs]—and when he stops supporting it, then [pauses for 14 seconds]—I'm not—the less well I am, the less easy it is for me to say anything to him. [00:13:19]
Um, [pauses] just like his [pauses] [sighs]—it is like the fact that, like, he recognizes that timing mode] (ph) and he tries pretty hard to—not to be somebody that I have to stand up to. You know? But, [sighs] that's how [shifts in seat] [pauses for ten seconds]—I feel like, particularly recently, there have been several times where it felt like I got kind of railroaded into something, and he was not aware that railroading was even considered a possibility, and would have been, you know, really upset to see that he was doing this. 
THERAPIST: I think part of what may be going on here is that pauses for 13 seconds]... [00:14:40]
...I think, um, [pauses]—do you think there may be a way that you're sort of playing James and me off against each other? But let me be careful about what I mean. I don't mean you're trying to get me to think badly of him, or trying to get him to think badly of me, but I do think you [pauses for five seconds]—I don't know quite how to say this—like, are—like maybe in a bit of a drama in your own head, where, um, [pauses] you know, [pauses] you give me some of your critical thoughts about him, and you give him some of your critical or skeptical thoughts about me, and then you work really hard with each of us to manage those that we now have, in your mind. And, you know, you kind of, uh, rid yourself that way of [pauses seven seconds], maybe, some of your own, like, skepticisms, frustrations, doubt... [00:16:05]
CLIENT: I become the defendant rather than the, uh—the—rather than the prosecutor?
THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe something like that. 
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah... [chuckles] 
THERAPIST: And then wind up, you know, feeling like it is difficult to stand up to him; I don't know about to me, but you've been talking about to him. 
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. 
THERAPIST: You know, like...
CLIENT: I mean, it is always—it is like [pauses]—but I see what you mean. I think you're right there. 
THERAPIST: I mean, I was going to say like you're really worried I'm going to get the wrong idea about him or think badly of him, which only matters [chuckles] in as much as it matters to you. You know, like, [pauses]... 
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:16:59]
THERAPIST: Besides, I would think, from the get-go, [pauses] you know, the criticisms you're concerned that I am having of him are probably pretty close to criticisms you have of him. 
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [Pauses] 
THERAPIST: Or his response, "Oh, my God, we're at the fucking beginning of this? What the hell?" 
CLIENT: [Chuckles] 
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] 
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: It is [chuckles] not entirely [chuckles]...
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Not entirely different from my own thought? [Chuckles] 
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Yeah. 
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, OK. [Shifts in seat] [Pauses for 43 seconds] 
[00:18:00]
CLIENT: No, so, um...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: ...I just—but still, in general, um, [pauses for 16 seconds] [shifts in seat] [pauses for four seconds]—I mean, one of the problems with saying, "OK, let's talk about my childhood," other than the fact that it is just like me feeling like I have to [whispers][negotiate for something] (ph) I just [sighs in exasperation]—I don't know what... [00:19:15]
THERAPIST: Probably about him (ph) on the—yeah. 
CLIENT: Yes. [Chuckles] Um, one is like—like I don't—[sighs] I don't think about it that much. I don't make connections between that and what's going on in my life. You know? Um, [pauses for five seconds]—yeah. And it is not so much that I just decided I wasn't going to think about it; it is more like, at some point, I came up with a model of what had happened, that seemed like it was going to be good enough, and I just kind of said, "OK, that's that," and [I'm thinking here] (ph). [00:20:11]
[Shifts in seat] And that a model doesn't [pauses] seem to be good enough, that—you know, the things that you've been saying that it—that, like, there's seems—things seem to be very disconnected and [pauses] don't make a lot of sense to you, like, it is still really hard for me to see those. Like, I don't—I don't see the ways that the model doesn't work very well or that easily. Um, [pauses for four seconds] so I don't really know how to start [barely audible] going to (ph)—yeah. And—and [pauses]—yeah, again, trying very hard to get you to tell me what to do. [Chuckles] But it is... [00:21:15]
THERAPIST: Well, one thing...
CLIENT: ...It seems that I am—actually am going to ask you. [Chuckles] 
THERAPIST: Sure. Well, I wasn't wanting to sort of, um, seem like I figured out about those, which [pauses] I don't know a lot about historiography; I'm sure you know more, but my...
CLIENT: I think it is fun. 
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] ...My impression is that part of the idea is that, you know, histories reflect the times people—like, basically the context in which they were living as well as the times they've written it out (ph). It is kind of like that, right? 
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. [00:21:57] 
THERAPIST: And, um, [pauses] so, [pauses] inevitably, there are sort of a bunch of things we [write down] (ph), we are being—psychologically, that is going to be reflected in the ways you've constructed in your history of other things, as well. 
CLIENT: OK. 
THERAPIST: So I'm not doubting construction (ph) about what to do, but just sort of schematically—I mean, that's a way to think about it, like, you know, how you've constructed your history is going to sort of look like ways you were trying to cope, things you were trying to cope with what you sort of target (ph) or accept, or how you [tend to look at things in time] (ph). 
CLIENT: OK, yeah. [00:23:01]
Um, James and I, on the way back from watching the game, um—I'm talking about my mom's family, and I have an aunt and uncle—my mother's next-youngest sister—there are five kids in her family—three girls, two boys—the next—so the next-younger sister, making her the exact middle child, went to school, became a therapist, and, basically, is just like, "Fuck you all," and [inaudible at 00:23:40]. [Chuckles] 
THERAPIST: Oh, my God. Is an academic psychologist or a clinician?
CLIENT: No, a clinician. 
THERAPIST: OK. 
CLIENT: Um, and then she and her husband, who was a Baptist?—a Baptist, pretty sure—I think he's a pastor now, [to a priest] (ph)—have both—both quit their jobs in the last five years, moved to Miami and became artists. [00:24:06]
Um, so she's a textile artist, and he's a painter at a—he's had a lot more, um—he's got a huge amount of initial success. And one of the things that she and James, and I were talking about was kind of—he thinks they're good and they're interesting, but they're not that good. 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: Um, but they're like exactly the right amount of being good and also pretty to be really saleable. 
THERAPIST: I see, so commercial. 
CLIENT: Um, yeah, but he is doing what is satisfying for him, artistically... 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh?
CLIENT: ...Like, and only that. So, you know, like—but part of it is like he does, like, very beautiful figure studies of young men, so, like, [slaps surface] you know... [Chuckles] 
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
CLIENT: ...People eat that shit up. Um... [Chuckles] [00:25:03]
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:25:03]
CLIENT: Uh, and I like his paintings much better than James does. Um, [chuckles] and where I'm going with this is that, like, those (ph) are still really, like, broken in a lot of ways, like, especially around our family. Um, you know, when—my dad loves her and loves those two. 
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
CLIENT: In part, you know, whenever I get too vocal in my criticisms a little bit, or whatever—but, occasionally, he's said, "You know, when your mother and I divorced, and everybody kind of had to choose sides, and—Margaret chose me, and that meant a whole lot to me, and it still does mean a whole lot to me." Um, that is pretty cool but, at the same time, it is also clearly like she's choosing anybody but her family. [00:26:05]
Um, [pauses] you know, so, like, I knit a lot; I don't think of myself as an artist, but I knit a lot, and I think there's a lot of interesting things you can do with it, and I like making pretty things. 
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
CLIENT: Um, and Margaret knows this, and she's a weaver, and just kind of walking down the street, like talking about her work and how it is going, and so forth, and why she chose the other mediums that she works in, and she was just like, "Well, you know, there's not really that far you can go with knitting," so weaving is clearly what it was. I was like—and, at the time, it didn't sting until, like, a couple of hours later, and I'm still like, "This—what, what? Why? Where did that come from?"
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] so she's kind of like that. [00:27:03]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: So—so James's and my working hypothesis is that, [chuckles] um, she worked really hard as a young woman to create a model of her childhood and her family that she could live with, and that could let her go and have her own life. Um, but then she kind of stopped, and it is not really working very well, necessarily, but that's where she is. 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: You know, like, the last conversation I had with her, we were talking about the Catholic Church, um, and I—I was kind of trying to describe my experiences in school, of seeing both, like, these really, really terrible things happening and also these really wonderful things happening, and these people for whom life has meaning and joy, and who are doing really good work, and by remaining within a Church that is really flawed, and that they have a really hard time dealing with but that they want to be in. [00:28:24]
And she was—and she was coming from a position that she had worked very closely with a monastery, and that she felt pretty (ph) betrayed by that community, in particular. Like, the leader of that community, who had pushed her really hard to forgive and reconcile with her parents, and then she had found out that he was pretty—uh, pretty embroiled or enmeshed in the, like, extensive decades-long covering up of child abuse that has been happening. [00:29:14]
Um, so I'm like, "Well, yeah, I don't—[pauses]"—so there was no way that conversation could go. Like, I tried really, really hard for us to find a place of common ground, but [pauses] she just was [pauses]—she was just like, "No, the Catholic Church is terrible. It is all terrible. Everyone needs to leave." Like, all of those people that you're talking about, who are, you know, those young, idealistic kids, like, they're going to get screwed, and they need to leave. And you're young and idealistic, so you don't realize this yet, but you're going to get fucked over, and you need to leave." Um, [pauses] and I—I kept trying to [pauses] [sighs]—I kept trying to find some plain on which we could agree, and this wasn't going to happen. [00:30:21]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: Um, and the conversation hurt my feelings. That really pissed me off. Um, and [pauses for ten seconds] I don't know—she's just prickly that way. Um, [pauses] so I don't want to be there in 30 years, certainly. 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:30:57] 
CLIENT: Um, [pauses for 12 seconds] [shifts in seat] I don't think I'll stop getting pissed off at people telling me that I'm too young to know better until I'm old enough that nobody tells me I'm too young to know better. 
THERAPIST: That's a...
CLIENT: And I don't know when that will happen [chuckles] because...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] 
CLIENT: ...I'm 27. [Chuckles] 
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] 
CLIENT: [Chuckles] 
[Silence for 27 seconds]
THERAPIST: I guess there are sort of two strands there that I'm kind of thinking through. The first is, I imagine, um, [pauses] you have some worry something like that could happen, let's say, between you and I, about your family. [00:32:04]
Like, I think, uh, [pauses for five seconds] that you will, um, [pauses for five seconds] worry that thinking about things that happen and ways you've retreated, uh, will give rise to very [pauses] conflicted feelings and difficult decisions about... 
CLIENT: Mm. 
THERAPIST: ...The courage (ph) that you want to have with the people in your family. 
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. I mean that's—I've worked pretty hard to [pauses]—yeah, to be at peace with people in my family and to be in relationships, so—and, yeah, I worry that I'll lose that. [00:33:17] 
THERAPIST: Um, and I—[pauses] again, that like with the stuff like James, I think you may give some of that to me, but I'm another psychologist like her.
CLIENT: Oh, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all. 
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] 
CLIENT: I think of you guys in two different ways. 
THERAPIST: I see. 
CLIENT: Um, I mean, I know she's a clinical psychologist, but I don't understand how, so I'm without (ph) [chuckles] ...
THERAPIST: I see. 
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Sorry. 
THERAPIST: No, no, that's OK. Um, I can imagine that, uh, [pauses] it kind of—I think you might have kind of given me sort of [pauses]—you know, we don't even know there would be, sort of, potentially more critical views for [pauses]... [00:34:17]
CLIENT: That might be happening but it doesn't feel like it is. 
THERAPIST: All right, OK. 
CLIENT: Um, yeah—no, I—I see where that is coming from... 
THERAPIST: Yeah, right. Yeah, it doesn't feel like that?
CLIENT: ...But I don't—it doesn't feel like that. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, I don't fucking know. [Sighs]
THERAPIST: Sure. 
CLIENT: I'm—I am feeling less and less able to [pauses]—um, you know, the wheel goes around, and back at the point where I—I feel like I just don't have any understanding of—on my own mental or emotional processes, and I just can't figure any of that out. Um, I don't... [00:35:05]
THERAPIST: So you...
CLIENT: ....I don't trust what I am saying or thinking, or feeling at all. Um...
THERAPIST: OK, I think what may be going on there is [pauses]—so you and I, right there, have different views of something [clears throat], where I said, "Hey, I think maybe you're doing this. Am I right?" "Nooo, I don't think I'm doing that. It doesn't feel like that to me." 
CLIENT: But I don't—I don't trust my own opinion there. 
THERAPIST: And then you are overcome with the sense of confusion. 
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: What I'm trying to wave my arms around about is [pauses] I think something may get triggered through you when you [pauses] feel a gap or sense of disagreement, or having different views. So much of what we've been talking about today, I think, has to do with trying to find common ground and avoiding conflict with people. [00:36:22]
CLIENT: Mm. 
THERAPIST: And then, just now, [pauses] you know, I'm not saying it was a good conflict, but, like, I felt, "Yeah," and you're like, "Mehhh." [Chuckles] 
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah. 
THERAPIST: And I guess I wondered [pauses]...
CLIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. Um, [pauses] why not—I wonder how much of my confusion comes from—yeah, I basically do think that I've kind of been talking to you, and talking to James...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: ...And you guys think very different things, and you think in very different ways, and I don't [pauses] feel as though I have a good read on where I actually see it. [00:37:15]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: Or [pauses] much control over my own head. Um, [pauses] yeah. 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
[Silence for 28 seconds] 
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:38:00] 
[Silence for another 20 seconds] 
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't do so well with conflict. Um...
THERAPIST: Mm. 
CLIENT: [And with] (ph) [inaudible at 00:38:28]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
[Silence for 22 seconds]
CLIENT: [Speaks very lowly] I think that, um, [inaudible at 00:38:59] ground. (ph). [00:39:00]
[Silence for 20 seconds]
CLIENT: [Speaks very lowly] Maybe I [was just] (ph) [speaks up] desperately, like, reaching out for, like, [pauses] something to hold onto, that will put me in the same universe as this person. [Speaks lowly again] You know? And that's probably the knack (ph) of it, that I—[becomes emotional] I don't feel like I exist if I'm not agreeing with at least somebody. [Sounds as if crying or laughing in exasperation.] 
THERAPIST: Like, that was important. [00:39:57]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] [Pauses for nine seconds] Mm—[pauses for another nine seconds] what about the [inaudible at 00:40:18] onset (ph) all of this, [pauses] I just feel sad. Um, she was just so hurt...
THERAPIST: Mm. 
CLIENT: ...And [pauses] always kind of lashing at me because she was so hurt, and, uh, that's just what her family does, and she just works so hard to get—to, like, get away from them, and she feels [differently about the same thing] (ph). [00:40:56]
Um, [pauses] yeah, and so all of my uncles and aunts do it, and they're, like—they're all [sighs]—it doesn't seem fair to do it, but she's also worked really hard. Um, you know, conciliate, conciliate, conciliate, and then lash out because [you're going to get hurt] (ph), and it feels like it [comes at an hour] (ph), and I don't know what to do with that. I [slaps surface] [pauses]—but I feel for so sad for them. Mm, [pauses] and I, you know, I feel like I can't—even to defend myself is [shifts in seat]—feels like an act of aggression. [00:42:08]
[No, I could spend] (ph) more [slaps surface] talking about that, but [speaks very lowly] [inaudible at 00:42:12] like any kind of [pauses]—but to do anything other than just sit there and take it feels like it is hurting them more. 
THERAPIST: Mm. 
[Silence for 20 seconds]
CLIENT: [Speaks very lowly] And I don't want to [inaudible at 00:42:53]. [inaudible at 00:42:55]—I don't want to get into it. [00:43:01] 
THERAPIST: Maybe you've tried to, like, require [inaudible at 00:43:06]. 
CLIENT: Yes. 
THERAPIST: Um... [pauses for 23 seconds]
CLIENT: Do we have time for me to tell a story, or is it time to stop?
THERAPIST: Um, a couple of minutes. 
CLIENT: OK, and, um, I was working at the sandwich place at inaudible at 00:43:45]...
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: ...And she was kind of a clusterfuck, um, because, as it turned out, the register system and the line system both got changed at the same time, so [chuckles] the way the sandwiches get made is different...
THERAPIST: Oh. [00:44:00]
CLIENT: ...And so even the people who have [been around a long time] (ph) time are still adjusting to it, and none of the managers yesterday were quite on their game, and so it was just a mess, and it was, like, the worst...
THERAPIST: What, is it a new sandwich system?
CLIENT: Oh, it is the one that everybody else does, where you—I mean, it is like you have a touchscreen keypad...
THERAPIST: Oh, OK. 
CLIENT: ...And then the sandwich comes up at a register somewhere else on the line, and people on the line make the sandwiches. 
THERAPIST: I see. 
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's different. 
CLIENT: Yeah, rather than the people in the line taking the order...
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: ....And making the sandwiches, and then giving them to...
THERAPIST: Right, right.
