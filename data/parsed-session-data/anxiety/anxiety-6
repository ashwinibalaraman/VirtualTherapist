
In 1965, Watts exploded with the pent-up rage of black people frustrated
by police brutality, dead-end lives, and the indifference of white society
to their plight. Martin Luther King, Jr., said that riots are the voice of
the unheard. The long scream in the night that rose up from Watts echoed
across the nation.


"Burn, baby, burn!" the rioters chanted as they smashed windows, looted
stores, and set fire to the neighborhoods. After five days of bloody warfare,
thirty dead, hundreds injured, thousands arrested, the rioting was over and
the governmental "fix" began. Federal money began to pour into the area.
Some of the programs were helpful. Others were beside the point.


The main problem with Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty was that it
was fought on the wrong battlefield. Few people seemed to realize that what
had to be "fixed" was not just the black ghetto but racist white America
whose fear of change ensured that the ghetto would continue to restrict the
movement of blacks into the mainstream. The programs that worked at all
were those that created new opportunities for poor people to get the training
they needed to become employable. I became involved in one of those
programs.


I was hired by the California State Department of Rehabilitation to train
indigenous aides to conduct groups with the hardcore unemployed in Watts.
"Indigenous" meant that these aides were from the same neighborhoods as
the people they would work with, the hope being that they could establish
rapport with tough, resistant clients more easily than middle-class white professionals
could. My mission was to teach aides the basics of how to run a
group in which the clients could see themselves in action and identify the
social and interpersonal difficulties they might encounter when they tried
to get or hold onto jobs.


The training started with an intensive three-day retreat in a San Diego
hotel. During the first two and a half days, the group members dealt with
one another. They were comfortable doing that. On the last afternoon, I
asked them to deal with me. I wanted them to witness a group leader being

[p. <i>157</i>]

"Okay, if you won't tell me how you feel about me, I'll tell you what I
feel about you," and I went around the group saying something to each
person. That opened the door and one by one they ventured comments
about me, all pretty mild stuff, polite, arm's length. I gave a little lecturette
about being prepared to be challenged because most groups eventually do
confront their leadership. They just looked at me. I reminded myself that I
was not only the group leader here but also the only white person in the
room, and I was not exactly giving them permission to deal with that particular
salient fact. Did I even want to do that? I wasn't sure. I took the coward's
way out and suggested we break for dinner.


When we assembled again in the meeting room I looked around and
immediately saw that people had been drinking, some mildly boozed, others
quite drunk. I realized that I'd made a terrible mistake not staying with the
group for dinner. I had isolated myself and now I was more of an outsider
than before. The fallout came quickly. One of the female aides spoke first.


"You know, you asked us before what we felt about you. Well I want to
tell you now what I feel. Lady, you don't know jack shit about who we are
or what we need."


"That's right," another chimed in, "you don't know jack shit."


A few group members shifted nervously in their chairs. I began to feel
anxious. I sat very still. I was thinking about how to respond when I noticed
a rather unnerving sound coming from one corner of the room. A group
member named George was sitting on the edge of his chair and growling at
me. The guttural sound seemed to come from deep inside him. He growled a
few more times, then he stood up and started toward me. He was drunk
and unsteady. George stopped about a foot in front of me. His eyes were
red and watery. He leaned into my face and spoke almost inaudibly.


"Honky bitch!"


George's body was tense, his hands were tight fists against his sides.


"You are a honky bitch!" he said again, louder. "Honky bitch!"


I didn't move. My only thought was that they were right. I didn't know
jack shit about this. I had no idea what might happen. Was I in danger?
Would anyone in the room be my ally? I didn't know if I should stop him,
call for help, or just sit there. My gut said just sit.


George stood in front of me, swaying slightly.

[p. <i>158</i>]

"Well," he said mostly to himself, "maybe I'm the man who can set this
honky bitch straight."


That seemed to amuse him, and he began to laugh. He put his hands up
to his head and laughed and laughed. Then abruptly, he stopped laughing.
There was not a sound in the room, but I sensed that something different
was happening. Slowly, I focused my eyes beyond George. I saw that three
of the male group members had moved silently forward until they were
inches behind George. They stood like statues, perfectly still, their arms out-stretched,
ready to grab him. But while he didn't move, they didn't move.
We stayed in this strange tableau for several long minutes, like dancers frozen,
waiting for some cue to resume motion. My heart was beating wildly,
my hands were clammy, but I was determined not to move. I stared at
George, and he stared back. Then, suddenly, his body began to shake as
though it could no longer contain his anger. He let out a yell, and both his
fists came up. The three men behind him lunged. They grabbed his arms,
pulling him away from me, and wrestling him to the floor. I took a deep
breath. When I tried to move, my body felt like it had turned to stone. The
three aides walked George out of the room, and the others began to stir.
Someone asked if I was okay and I found my voice enough to say I was.


"Cool," one of the group members said quietly. "You were cool."


Others nodded in agreement. I suggested we take a break then come back
to talk about what had happened. As I stood up, several people approached
and without a word put their arms around me. My body relaxed and those
around me felt it. The barrier was down. By experiencing my vulnerability,
the distance between us was reduced. They later told me that it was important
to them that I'd not run away. White people usually run away from
black anger. They thought I wasn't afraid, but of course I was. Despite my
fear, I knew if I had run that would have been the end of me with them.


I survived the "honky bitch" crisis and had my head straightened out
about how much I didn't know about what I was doing. That was my first
awakening to the simmering hatred that underlay the race wars in America.
It was not to be my last.


The violence in this country in 1968 seemed epidemic: the Robert Kennedy
shooting, Martin Luther King, Jr., killed, and bloody riots in response
to Dr. King's murder. Racial tensions were at an all-time high. I got a call
from Dan Mermin, director of Bell &amp; Howell's Human Development Institute
in Atlanta. He wanted me to develop an ENCOUNTERTAPE program
that would address the enmity between the races. The tapes could be used

[p. <i>159</i>]

I jumped at the chance to develop this program and was soon spending
one week each month in Atlanta, writing, testing, revising group processes
that we hoped would bring blacks and whites together to talk through their
animosity. My coworker in this development phase was a young black man
named Freeman T. Pollard. Freeman was twenty-six years old, big and broad
shouldered, sweet, warm, funny, a charmer with a dazzling smile. At the
drop of a hat, Freeman could be down-home country or he could be the
ultimate sophisticate. He'd studied at Harvard and NYU, been a Peace Corps
volunteer in Africa and a special assistant to the president of a southern
college. Though I was fourteen years his senior, we easily established a peer
relationship.


Freeman and I often worked in places away from the distractions of the
busy HDI offices. On one of my trips, I was staying in a first-floor motel
room with a large picture window that looked out on a walkway used by
other guests. Freeman arrived, and we spread our papers out on the twin
beds. We began working, but I noticed that Freeman seemed quite nervous.
His head would swivel around to the window whenever anyone walked by.
Finally I asked.


"Freeman, what on earth is wrong with you? What are you so antsy
about?"


He glowered at me, shook his head, and finally said, "You don't get it,
do you?"


"Get what?"


His tone had an edge to it. "You see, you are a white woman, I am a
black man, and this is the South. We are alone in this motel room. Everyone
who walks by sees that. Southern men do not take kindly to black men in
motel rooms with white women. Sometimes they express themselves in very
dramatic ways about thisâ€”like hauling my ass out of here and beating the
shit out of me."


"But Freeman, we're just working in here. Anyone can see that."


Freeman shook his head.


"All these Southern crackers need to know is that a nigger is in here with
a white lady."


Freeman walked over to the window and drew the drapes, then he turned
and smiled, as though to reassure me that it was okay between us. We went

[p. <i>160</i>]

The other person working with us was Dan Mermin, a white man and
Freeman's best friend. It was Freeman's idea that the three of us should
attend a race relations weekend workshop in San Francisco conducted by
Price Cobbs, the black psychiatrist who wrote the book <i>Black Rage</i>. The brochure
copy said the workshop would use the "bloodless riot" approach. I
wondered what in the world that meant.


Price Cobbs had met Freeman and he knew who I was from my work at
Esalen. There were about twenty people in the room, some black, some
white. Price's four young black assistants sat unsmiling against one wall. To
begin, Price talked about his conviction that the rationalizations and blindness
that mask white racism had to be forcefully confronted before real dialogue
between the races could take place. In the morning and the early afternoon,
he talked about this issue, the "bloodless riot." In the late afternoon,
he demonstrated his pointâ€”on me.


Price sat down right in front of me and began asking questions about
my thinking on race relations. I was wary about his talking only to me, but
I answered his questions. I'm improvising from memory here, but I believe
I've got the tone right, if not Price's exact words. He began with several
benign questions.


"What do you think whites want in their relations with blacks? Do you
think most whites believe they are racists?"


Over the next hour, Price's questions became increasingly harsh and accusative.
I tried to respond to him until, at one point, he stuck his face in mine
and snarled, "Liar!" Price Cobbs was a big man with a powerful physique. He
was so close to me I could feel the heat of his body. I wasn't sure what was
happening. I felt confused, off-center. After calling me a liar numerous times,
he began to shout in my face. I'm not sure what his words were, I just felt
assaulted. Then he called upon his assistants to join in. They moved in on
me in full force, shouting obscenities, their faces distorted with rage. Inches
from me, they kept up a steady barrage. I didn't remember ever feeling so
completely under attack.


I summoned all my courage and told them to leave me alone, but the
words came out in a whisper and just seemed to make them angrier. They
verbally pounded away at me, taunting, spitting out insults. I turned away,

[p. <i>161</i>]

"Leave her alone! Damn it, leave her alone!"


Everything stopped dead.


Price approached Freeman, who now stood by himself in the middle of
the room.


"Well, well, what have we here?" Price said, coyly. "A black man who
rescues white women?"


Freeman mumbled something about it being unnecessary to be so brutal.
Then he looked like he was sorry he'd said anything at all. Price put his face
up very close to Freeman's. Slowly and deliberately he hissed, "What we
seem to have here is a black man with natural hair but a processed mind."


Freeman said nothing. He stood frozen to the spot, his eyes following
Price who was circling him. There was silence in the room. Then Price
stopped in front of Freeman and said slowly into his face, "You have some
work to do, brother. You need to find out what your priorities are. You
need to do something about that processed mind. Now sit down and try to
get with the program."


Freeman sat. Price came over to where I was still rolled up against the
wall. He got on his knees and spoke into my ear, loudly enough so the whole
room could hear,


"You see, this is what it's like to be black in America. White folks get up
in your face and they call you names and swear at you and insult you. You
say stop but they go right on. They don't care how you feel or what it's
doing to you. They want you to be scared to death so you can't defy them.
They want you to be all rolled up like this, harmless and neutralized. This
is my message. If you want to fight in our war, you damn well better know
how it feels to be black in this country, every day, every night, everywhere
you go, your whole life long. This battle is never over. You can't quit and
you can't escape. That's what you have to get, the relentlessness of it. If you
don't get that you don't get anything!"

[p. <i>162</i>]

Price slowly backed away. I said nothing and I didn't move. Price ended
the session and said he'd see us the next morning. People got up slowly,
quietly, and filed out.


Freeman and Dan came to me and gently lifted me to my feet. I felt
unsteady. None of us spoke as we walked to the car, but once I was in the
backseat, the dam burst for me and I cried, wracking sobs that released the
feelings I'd been holding in for an hour. Freeman reached back and held
my hand. Then, suddenly, something happened, the reason for which I have
never really understood. Maybe it was the heightened emotionality of the
afternoon, triggering the need in all of us for release. Freeman turned to
Dan, who was driving, and he choked out Dan's name, as though to get his
attention. Dan looked perplexed.


"What, Freeman, what?"


"You know I'm gay, don't you Dan? You do know that, don't you?"


Dan looked at Freeman disbelievingly. The car swerved. Dan quickly returned
his eyes to the road.


"I've wanted to tell you for so long," Freeman went on. "I don't know
why I'm telling you now, but I don't want to hold it back any more."


Dan looked straight ahead but said, "Okay, Freeman. I didn't know, but
I'm glad you told me."


I couldn't believe this was happening. I'd been afraid to tell Freeman I
was gay because I was worried about what he would think of me. I put my
hand on his shoulder and I could hardly get the words out. "Freeman, I'm
gay too."


Now it was Freeman's turn to look disbelieving. He turned to me.


"You are?"


I nodded and Freeman reached back and grabbed my hand again, squeezing
it hard. Freeman, so different from me in so many waysâ€”in different
decades of our lives, different gender, different race, but suddenly we had
something so much in common that it seemed to obliterate all the other
differences.


In the hotel elevator, Dan put his arms around his longtime friend and
with that he didn't have to say anything. Freeman smiled and looked relieved.
These two would remain the closest of friends, even more strongly
bonded by this extraordinary day than they had been before.


We ordered dinner in Dan and Freeman's room, not wanting to be apart.
We talked about what had happened, and we all agreed that Price Cobbs's
approach to racial encounter was too strong an approach for our audiotape-directed

[p. <i>163</i>]

As I was leaving to return to my room, Freeman said, "Are you going
back tomorrow?"


"I don't know. Are you?"


Freeman looked straight at me. "I have no choice," he said. "I have to
go back."


I, too, went back the next day, but I didn't say a single word. Price avoided
me. I listened and watched, and I was glad when it was over. That night,
Freeman, Dan, and I flew to Los Angeles. On Monday morning, Price Cobbs
phoned me. "Are you all right?" he asked. "You were pretty quiet yesterday."


For a moment, I thought about telling him that I was not all right, using
his concern to punish him for his brutal treatment of me, but I didn't.


"I'm fine," I said.


"Good. I'm glad. Well, let me know if I can be helpful to you in any way.
Be seeing you."


As it turned out, we did see each other quite soon. The following month,
Price turned up on a racism panel with me at the University of Georgia.
Here was the cool intellectual Price Cobbs, calmly discussing race relations
issues. As I watched him, I could see his snarling face an inch from mine,
screaming at me, "Liar! Liar! Liar!" I would never forget the lesson of his
bloodless riot. I would never forget him.


Freeman, Dan, and I finished the <i>Black/White ENCOUNTERTAPES</i>, and
they were used for years in a variety of situations where race relations were
an issue, particularly in the military. Freeman and I remained friends, staying
in touch during the long periods when he lived and worked in Africa, seeing
each other when he returned to this country. In 1987 we went together to
the National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights in Washington. Freeman
died of AIDS in 1991. Dan Mermin gave the eulogy at his memorial service.


It was my last night in Atlanta. I was having dinner with John, one of the
HDI staff members. After dinner John asked if there was any place I'd like
to go. It occurred to me that I would like to see where Martin Luther King,
Jr., was buried, so I asked John if he knew where the grave was.


"No idea," he said, "but it shouldn't be hard to find out."

[p. <i>164</i>]

<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000005176-I0016&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

We drove to one of Atlanta's black neighborhoods. John went into a convenience
store and asked directions to Dr. King's burial place. No one in
the store knew where it was. We drove on until we saw two people walking
down the street. I rolled down my window and asked if they knew where
Dr. King was buried. Both shrugged, they didn't know. John pulled into a
gas station. Nope, no one there had any idea where the grave was.


I couldn't believe it. How could people not know this.


Then I had an idea. I went to a telephone and called a taxi. When it
arrived, I asked the question. Sure, the driver knew where the burial site
wasâ€”South View Cemetery in south Atlanta. We hired the cab and followed
it to a rather desolate area of town. The gates to the South View Cemetery
were closed, and I assumed at such a late hour they would be locked, but

[p. <i>165</i>]

Inside the dark cemetery, we drove slowly along a narrow winding road.
About two hundred yards down the road, we saw a white canopy over a
crypt with a small flame burning in front of it. That had to be it. We stopped
and got out. The night was very still. Standing in front of the crypt, in the
flickering light of the flame, we read the words engraved there.


"Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, I'm free at last."


I felt in awe to be in such close proximity to this extraordinary man. I
contemplated the words, beginning to blur through tears as I thought about
the tragedy of Dr. King's death, the loss to so many people whose lives he
might yet have touched. When I looked up, I couldn't believe what I saw.
Just beyond the crypt, across the narrow street and quite visible from where
we stood, were a neon-lit gas station and a laundromat. Several cars went
by. How unseemly a last resting place for a man of such distinction, a Nobel
Prize winner, an inspired leader, a giant among human beings. It seemed
too undignified, too accessible. But he wouldn't be there for long.


Later, I learned that Dr. King had been interred initially at South View
because his grandparents were buried there. In 1970 he was moved to the
newly constructed Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Nonviolent Social
Change in Atlanta. His crypt stands on a raised platform in the middle of
a sizable reflecting pool, a much more fitting burial site for Martin Luther
King, Jr., much more suitable for this great man than an unlocked cemetery
across the street from a gas station and a laundromat. It is said that a million
people a year visit the center to pay their respects to Dr. King, standing
before the reflecting pool, viewing his crypt from that distance. But at one
o'clock in the morning in June 1969, he was resting in that unlocked cemetery,
and we stood alone with him in the quiet summer night.
