WHEN I WAS at last discharged from the sanitarium, it was
like jumping out of the hell of unreality into the hell of
reality. The illness had destroyed my marriage; it had cost
me my wife, my home and my job. The abominable depression
and hypertension were gone--the shock treatments
had taken care of that--but the other symptoms, all
of the symptoms I had experienced before my breakdown,
were still very much with me. I was still highly nervous,
subject to fits of anxiety, panic and tension, rather paranoid
and extremely fearful of cars, elevators, subways and
tall buildings, among other things. I felt like a man clinging
to the edge of sanity, fearful that if he suddenly lost
his grip he would tumble back into the yawning abyss
below. Above, there were people grinding their heels on
my hands.


The analysts had assured me that I was well, that I
was perfectly capable of getting a job and resuming my
place in the community--without Laurie. I must, they said,
learn the art of self-reliance (an art that I had learned long

On the day of my discharge, I said good-bye to the
other patients and, not daring to look back, walked out
into a chilly March day. I wondered if I&apos;d ever have to
return. Would I, like many of the others back there, suffer
a relapse? It was, I knew, a toss of the coin. But if it happened
again, I assured myself, there would be a way out.
I could never again suffer what I had suffered. At least
death had some dignity.


Two friends, Bill James, an Englishman, and Marty
Epstein, a science writer, met me at the hospital. (Bill had
come regularly to the hospital during visiting hours to keep
me company. We had played a lot of chess together, but
the shock treatment had made me forget all that. Two
weeks later I was to ask him if he played chess.) Marty
had invited me to stay at his apartment until I found one
of my own.


We no sooner got to Marty&apos;s apartment than I started
getting the shakes. I was seized by a panic attack and I
found myself wanting to run back to the hospital.


"Look, I can&apos;t take it, you guys," I said. "I can&apos;t take
it, I tell you. I&apos;ve got to go back. No, damn it, I can&apos;t go
back."


"Let&apos;s walk, kid," Marty said, unperturbed. Marty and

We walked, the three of us, walked for miles down to
the lower East Side. Then we went into an Irish bar and
had a beer and talked about old times. The panic subsided.


I stayed with Marty for a week and I was to discover
that none of my friends, as intelligent as they were, really
understood my sickness. It was virtually impossible to communicate
to Bill and Marty what I had been through. Like
most other people, Bill and Marty held pat notions about
the psychological causes of mental illness. To them it was
simply a matter of a person&apos;s thoughts and feelings going
haywire for a time, only to be rearranged and set aright by
the diligent efforts of a psychoanalyst.


One sunny morning--I had been out of the hospital
three days--I awoke feeling, oddly enough, rather well. I
cherished the moment--because I knew it would pass--and
jumped out of bed, took a shower and ate a hearty breakfast.
Marty wasn&apos;t around; his bed hadn&apos;t been slept in, so
I assumed he had stayed with his girl friend. The phone
rang.


"Marty?" a voice asked. It was Bill James. I felt
rather playful and knowing that it was difficult to distinguish
Marty&apos;s voice from my own over the phone, I
said:


"Yeah, this is Marty."


"I say, how&apos;s Stefan?" James inquired solicitously.


"Okay, I guess," I said. "He&apos;s not here. Went for a
walk."


"The poor chap," James said. "He really misses Laurie,

"You think so, huh?"


"I suspect so. But I have an idea. What the old boy
needs is a bloody good time with some really passionate
creature. Somebody who&apos;d make him forget Laurie. Somebody ..."


"Somebody real hot...."


"Somebody who&apos;d make him feel masculine," James
added.


Now I was being analyzed by my friends, dammit!
All of them would have several dozen psychological reasons
as to why Laurie and I were separated.


"Got anyone in mind?" I said.


"No, have you?"


"Nope."


A week later I got an apartment in the Village. When
I was well I had vowed that I would never live in the
Village but now I was drawn to the place. Besides, the
apartment was cheap and it was a long way from Laurie&apos;s
uptown apartment. Then I started looking for a job.


Job-hunting is tough enough for a person who is well;
when a person is ill, it&apos;s an almost impossible task. I still
trembled when I got into a subway or an elevator. Sometimes
I suffered from intense claustrophobia; skyscrapers
would seem to close in on me, and always there was that
old sensation of being trapped. I often panicked during
job interviews, and I had to muster all my play-acting
ability to appear calm and confident. I had to pretend. I
had to hide from view the turbulence within me. I doubt

Meanwhile, the phone in my apartment was constantly
jangling. Friends--my friends and Laurie&apos;s friends
--frequently called me up to ask how I was and to invite
me to dinner. In this I could see Laurie&apos;s hand; she had
asked them to keep me busy, keep me occupied. But the
evenings with my friends were always wanting, somehow.
We&apos;d talk uneasily without communicating and there
seemed to be a barrier between us. I couldn&apos;t relate to the
people I loved most. And, always, the question of Laurie
seemed to lurk in the background. They had gotten accustomed
to us being together. Now her absence made her
poignantly present, and their lips would form questions
but the questions were never asked. My illness and our
separation were as much a mystery to them as it was to me,
though I&apos;m certain that each of them had a good psychological
theory that he was keeping to himself. Sometimes
I&apos;d ask if they had seen Laurie, and they would reply,
guardedly, that they had and that she looked well. And
then someone would change the subject.


Once I got a call from Tom Berry and we had lunch
together at Michel&apos;s on his expense account. Big Tom, a
copywriter for an ad agency, was not his usual jolly self.
That day he seemed depressed. It had finally happened.
His wife had left him after six years of what I thought, at
least, had been a perfect marriage. She had taken the two
kids.


I listened to Tom talk bitterly about his marriage. His
wife, he told me, had been seeing a psychoanalyst; but in

[p. <i>185</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00185&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"My analyst told me," I interjected, "that Laurie and
I were too much alike."


"Well, whaddaya know about that?" Tom said.


Listening to Tom I realized how much Laurie and I
had had in our marriage. Before I became ill, we had been
closer and deeper in love than most of the couples we
knew. A great longing to see her again came over me. I
wanted to know how she was, how she looked.


When I got home, I paced the floor for an hour trying
to summon the courage to call her. I finally picked up the
phone and dialed her number. Then I slammed the receiver
down fiercely. It wouldn&apos;t do. I had hurt her enough. Besides,
my illness--and our analysts--had placed an insurmountable
barrier between us.


That night, and every night for the next few days, I
cried myself to sleep like a helpless child.


My mother flew in that weekend to visit with me, and
my cousin Nick, a psychiatrist, whom I was very fond of,
came in from Pennsylvania. It was the first time I had
seen my mother in a year. Tears streaking down her cheeks,
she hugged and kissed me and then, for my father who was
too ill to come, she hugged and kissed me some more. It
was good to hold her in my arms again. She kept asking me
how I was. "Never felt better in my life, Mom," I lied.
"How&apos;s Dad?" "Oh, he&apos;s good. He feel real good now that

[p. <i>186</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The three of us went to a Greek restaurant, and while
Mom updated me on the doings of the relatives, Nick sat
puffing his pipe reflectively. He was, he announced, returning
to Greece in a few months to establish an out-patient
clinic at the mental hospital where he had been a resident
doctor before coming to the states. "The American colony
there has increased, you see," he explained, a twinkle in
his eye.


Before we had finished dinner Nick and I got into a
violent argument over whether the causes of mental illness
were physical or psychological. Nick was strictly Freudian
but at least he had a sense of humor.


"What are you guys going to do," I asked, "if some
tweedy, $5,000 biochemist discovers that it&apos;s all metabolic
after all?"


"It will never happen," Nick said. "Nothing will ever
take the place of psychoanalysis."


"You&apos;ve got a bank vault for a mind," I said. "How
the hell do you know what it&apos;s all about? Have you ever
been sick? You can only theorize about it."


"Boys, boys," Mom cut it short. We both quieted down
and Mom proceeded to side with Nick.


"I don&apos; unerstand these tings," she said, "but Grigorios,
you listen to your cousin. He is right. I tink it is
psychological. You know, just the other day, for example,
Daddy invite this Hindu man to dinner. I forget that the
Hindu don&apos; eat meat. I make stuffed cabbage, like you

Three days later I took Mom to the train station. As
we stood on the platform we were both fighting to hold
back the tears. "Sonny," she said, "maybe you and Laurie
some day get back together again. Maybe some day you
be marriedly happy again." "Sure, Mom," I said. "Some
day, maybe."


When I got back to the apartment, the phone was
ringing. It was Liz Moore, an old friend who had been
fairly successful as an abstract painter. She was glad to
know, she said, that I was out of the hospital and would I
come to her party next Saturday? Ten o&apos;clock or thereabouts
at her studio in the Village.


"We&apos;re going to have some special hors d&apos;oeuvres,"
she said.


"Oh, yeah? What?"


"LSD," she whispered.
