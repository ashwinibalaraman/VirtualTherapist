BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, what do you do in your free time?
<b>PT:</b> Um, lately, just been moving back in but, uh, been hanging out at the pool a lot, um, that's about it.  Working out.  I started working out a couple months ago.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, where at?
<b>PT:</b> Gold's Gym.  I like that.
<b>DR:</b> How often do you go there?
<b>PT:</b> Um, at least three times a week.
<b>DR:</b> Go by yourself?
<b>PT:</b> No, I go with my roommate from the previous place, a guy I know, I bench with.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So we go after work.  So that's good, gives me something to do.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have a roommate at the, down at your new place?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh, no.
<b>DR:</b> Are you already moved?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, semi.
<b>DR:</b> Semi?
<b>PT:</b> 50/50.
<b>DR:</b> So what, where did you spend last night?  Where was your toothbrush?
<b>PT:</b> At, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] over there.
<b>DR:</b> New place?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I need to transition, I guess.  We still need to get some more stuff out.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But, even my bed's in there now, so -
<b>DR:</b> Are those pretty full there?  A lot of people live there?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean it's not during the summer because a lot of parents buy there and their kids come live down there and they resell them.  Especially if they have two kids, resell them in eight years after the kids are out.
<b>DR:</b> Yep.
<b>PT:</b> It's usually what a lot of people do down there.  Like in summer is pretty dead [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Is it?  Pretty safe there?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> They've got security?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah, you can't get in.  That's, I wish it was easier.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  For your friends you mean?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, that and it's just you've got to have codes and keys for everything it seems like, so.  That's all right.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's a good thing.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's not bad.
<b>DR:</b> So free time you're working out and what else?
<b>PT:</b> That's about it.  Go, go, come home, change clothes, go work out, come home and watch an hour worth of TV and go to bed.  That's about it.  Monday through Friday and then -
<b>DR:</b> What time you getting up?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, 6:30ish.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> I'm usually asleep by 10:30.
<b>DR:</b> What time you got to be to work?
<b>PT:</b> 7:15.  We open at 8:00, but I usually try to get there between 7:15 and 7:30.
<b>DR:</b> So, you got yourself a real routine, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Pretty much, yeah.  Of course, I got to be in somewhat of a routine.  Got to go to bed early.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Girlfriend?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's good.  She's, uh, last week of teaching's this week, I guess they're all out.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum
<b>PT:</b> She's got half days.  But, you know, of course then she's got nothing to do this summer, so -
<b>DR:</b> I bet you wouldn't want to tell her that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she, she -
<b>DR:</b> She's got things to do.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, not much.  She's not working.
<b>DR:</b> Isn't she?  No classes she has to take for continuing education this year?
<b>PT:</b> No, because she did all that throughout the school year.  They have classes they take, and she's not going to grad school, so -
<b>DR:</b> You know, she's teaching where?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] but I don't, I don't know if she's going to do that another year.  I think they got new contracts coming up.  She might teach somewhere else.
<b>DR:</b> She got a contract yet or -
<b>PT:</b> I think so.  I think so, yeah.  Yeah, obviously, yeah, because it's already, I think you have to have it by either mid-May.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, usually.  People don't realize teachers are year to year like that.
<b>PT:</b> I know, I tried.
<b>DR:</b> A fair amount of insecurity in that profession.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh, yeah.  Well now, even teachers are having a hard time trying to find jobs.  I don't think as much as other professions, but still -
<b>DR:</b> Thanks to our governor.
<b>PT:</b> Well, that's right, exactly.  Yeah, they're having a tough time, so -
<b>DR:</b> He's not the education governor.
<b>PT:</b> No, yeah, my girlfriend says that all the time.
<b>DR:</b> I mean he is something else, I mean this, we're number 50, you know, it's like it's not bad enough.
<b>PT:</b> Right, exactly.
<b>DR:</b> Let's see if we can get down below Bahamas or -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.
<b>DR:</b> Or, some third world country.
<b>PT:</b> Right, exactly.  That's basically all that we're doing, especially when call it education [INAUDIBLE].  She hates it.
<b>DR:</b> She's not going to stick with it?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know what she's going to do; she might just do speech pathology.  There's a couple good schools and she's applied to [DEIDENTIFIED], so we'll see how that goes.
<b>DR:</b> For that year?  For next year?
<b>PT:</b> Uh.
<b>DR:</b> I guess not if she's got a contract now.
<b>PT:</b> No, I think probably another year.  She took her GRE and all that so we'll see how that pans out.  She, I don't think she wants the daily grind of teaching but she likes the school and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I think if she did speech pathology, she thinks she'd like it.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> She [INAUDIBLE] doing that too.  It will be all right.
<b>DR:</b> So you're going to move and save yourself a few dollars?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  I wanted to buy a place but it won't be this year.  I don't want to buy a place yet.  Maybe next year.  Maybe they'll extend that tax credit thing another year.  Homebuyer tax credits.
<b>DR:</b> That's right.  That's $10,000.00 off of $160,000.00?  Is it $10,000.00 or is it $8000.00?
<b>PT:</b> I think it's $8000.00.
<b>DR:</b> Eight thousand?
<b>PT:</b> No money down, it's a good deal, I mean, if you got, if you want to stay here for five years, it's a good deal, but I don't know if I want to stay here five years.
<b>DR:</b> You can't get one of those places with the gates and that deal?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, not with that deal.  You might able to but, you got to have $16,000.00, I guess, or $17,000.00 to put down on it, so.  I tried to borrow from my mom; she wouldn't -
<b>DR:</b> She didn't go for that?
<b>PT:</b> No, no.  She had, I said, "I'll give it back to you when I, when I sell it."  She [INAUDIBLE] it was a bad idea.
<b>DR:</b> She's had it for a while though?  Or she -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So she got a good deal on it too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, not long, not since [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That's not, probably a good place.  A crazy place on game days I'm sure.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, it's fun in football season, and it's nice, I mean, the pool area and everything is nice and big though  -
<b>DR:</b> Is it?
<b>PT:</b> It's really nice.  It makes you feel like you're not in [DEIDENTIFIED], some resort, so, it's fun.  So -
<b>DR:</b> How are you doing with your worries?
<b>PT:</b> Doing good with worries, just been stressed out, kind of moving and stuff, probably a little more anxious than usual, but I think that's just because of everything that's going on.
<b>DR:</b> Change doesn't come easy for [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> No, that's probably most of the reason why.  Nothing else really going on inside of me.  It's just that.
<b>DR:</b> I think maybe feel out of your element a bit?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, that and usually this time of year, every year, moving, a new place and job and all that stuff, kind of is harder than usual.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Out of the routine.  So, but besides that, I mean, no real worries or anything.
<b>DR:</b> How, how you doing with routines?  You getting stuck on things or -
<b>PT:</b> No, I just have my, I mean, I have my daily routine.  I get out of it, you know, it throws me off; I get anxiety.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But it's just more recently I think just because of moving and my girlfriend's been finishing up a job and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> You find yourself wasting much time though with routine?
<b>PT:</b> No -
<b>DR:</b> Getting stuck on repetitive stuff or -
<b>PT:</b> Um, not really repetitive stuff, like I don't, not like, doing stuff over and over.  Just more routine than anything.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Just got to, you know, get off and work out, do this, be in bed by this time.  If not, it throws me off.
<b>DR:</b> You know in the past you kind of had a little trouble being efficient because you kind of get stuck on some things and -
<b>PT:</b> I'm pretty good.  I mean that's one thing like at work and stuff I've been a lot better at.  I mean, that's good.
<b>DR:</b> You know, doing everything yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean I try to delegate, and do what I, I like to do a lot myself so it's har, I have to delegate.  It's the hardest thing to do.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Making sure it got done your way.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Letting it go.  Yeah.  Letting it go and being good enough.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> That's tough.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I wish I could just do everything but you can't.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Not in management and stuff like that, so.
<b>DR:</b> How many people do you have under you?
<b>PT:</b> Um, assistant manager, and then two other employ, two other white shirt employees, and then I have two car preps.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Four.
<b>DR:</b> Your car preps drive you nuts?
<b>PT:</b> No, they just wash cars.  They're pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> They don't do too bad a job?
<b>PT:</b> No, they're good.  I stay on them.
<b>DR:</b> That's what I mean you got to kind of -
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, well you do, because they're not all in I guess you could say they're not career employees.  So -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> It's a lot harder to get them motivated.
<b>DR:</b> So you're company ended up doing pretty good.  It was the Alamo people I guess that, uh, they might be looking for jobs.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah well Alamo and National, yeah, they're, um, they're just a totally different business.  Totally different but, and they were just, the Vanguard Group, or Vanguard Holding Company was bought by Enterprise.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, some jobs are combined.  People still keeping their jobs, they're just staying National/Alamo and Enterprise.  Just one person owns them.
<b>DR:</b> Your company wasn't bought.
<b>PT:</b> No, [DEIDENTIFIED] just owns it all now.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But it's just like, the things Alamo/National did good, we're taking things that we did good and some things just making more efficient.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, hopefully, it'll all work out.
<b>DR:</b> So no more Alamo signs at the airport, huh?
<b>PT:</b> No, they'll still be National/Alamo.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, really?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  They're keeping separate identities to have separate, separate renters.  So, the people who are at National/Alamo you have [INAUDIBLE], just like Hertz had their business corporate world type deal.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So you guys will just be behind the scenes running it.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  More back end than anything.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Not really much on the front end.
<b>DR:</b> So it really won't make a whole lot of difference to you, I guess.
<b>PT:</b> No, but it might provide some career opportunities.
<b>DR:</b> That's what I was going to say.  Some opportunity for you maybe.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, some more of that, definitely, but besides that, nothing, just a few changes.  Which I'm interested to go to that and hear what they're doing.
<b>DR:</b> Yep, what's the next step for you then?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I get a city, area manager.  Um, I get a bigger branch, a two hundred car branch, maybe for a year or two and then an area manager.  Those spots are -
<b>DR:</b> More rare?
<b>PT:</b> A lot more rare, yeah.  You got a lot of branch managers but probably 12 area managers in South Carolina, lower Georgia.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> That they run a certain region.
<b>DR:</b> Are your numbers looking good?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we, um, we were the branch on [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] was the best in [DEIDENTIFIED] numbers wise.  So that was good.  So it's going good.  I wish I could find something, I like, I like my job.  I just don't like what we do, like, I don't like renting cars.  I really like music.  I wish I could find something in music, it's just it's very hard to get into that business.  Like even the business side of music would be fun but -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So I like what I do; I just wish we were doing something with music man, so, but -
<b>DR:</b> You looking around a little bit?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I tried to look around, like we went to [DEIDENTIFIED] a couple of weekends ago to go see if we want to move there maybe.  Just looking out, just trying to branch out now.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> If I move or do something; I want to do it now.
<b>DR:</b> You and your girlfriend went?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Look around?
<b>PT:</b> And my, we got a third roommate, he, uh, went with us too because he's thinking about going there too.  So all three of us keep a place, but, it's just jobs right now and stuff.  And the music industry it's, you got to know somebody to really get involved.
<b>DR:</b> Your place have openings up there?
<b>PT:</b> No -
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] with [DEIDENTIFIED] now.  No, you either got to quit or some people will transfer just to keep their job and as soon as they found another one, in three months, they'd quit.  That's what a lot of people did when they transfer with [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> That's what you would do.
<b>PT:</b> Right, exactly.
<b>DR:</b> Go out to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'd just transfer so I could get a paycheck and then quit in three months when you found what you wanted to do.  So a lot of people took advantage of that, so -
<b>DR:</b> So you'd have to reapply to [DEIDENTIFIED] up there and start at, uh -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All over?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] think they would do that to be honest with you.  I think you're kind of set where you are unless you're promoted or take a lateral move.  Because it used to be that you could be demoted one step -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But they can't do that.
<b>DR:</b> Can you take a lateral move?
<b>PT:</b> I think you can.  If I wanted to put in for maybe something the same level, maybe different position, different title I could do that.
<b>DR:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Right.  But I don't, I don't think there is much, we only hear about openings out of South Carolina.  It's all kind of small world.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Big companies, but we all got our small worlds, I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And in [DEIDENTIFIED] there's really no jobs that I want there.  I mean I like [DEIDENTIFIED] I just would rather be doing something else.
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]'s a nice city.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I like it, I like it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, a lot to offer there.  It's pretty progressive.  I've had a number of young people just recently move up there -
<b>PT:</b> Really?
<b>DR:</b> And they seemed to like it quite a lot.
<b>PT:</b> I want, I think it would be, it's just jobs.  I mean I'm not packing up and moving unless I have a job.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you should get a job there, of course.
<b>PT:</b> I, I, I could get a job.  That's, I guess a job I really want.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to give it some time, and resume and all that stuff.
<b>DR:</b> You doing anything with music now?
<b>PT:</b> Not playing wise but I'd love to get into the more business side of it.  That's what I really want to do.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Got to be good at it.  My brother wants me to be his tour manager one day.  Um, I'm busy all the time on the phone, planning.  He's like, "You'd be the best tour manager ever."  And I would be.  I would be good at that but, it's not something you can apply to be that type job.  You know people internally -
<b>DR:</b> You know him.
<b>PT:</b> I know him; I can do him, yeah, definitely.  But, it's going to be a while before he ever makes it so -
<b>DR:</b> Is he getting anywhere?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's in Washington right now.  Just on tour, him and some other guy.  Like acoustic songs.
<b>DR:</b> Washington the state?
<b>PT:</b> State, um-hum, up in that area, [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> What's he play?  What kind of music?
<b>PT:</b> It's just like pop rock.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> But he uh -
<b>DR:</b> He's having a good time then.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he likes it.  He's lonely at times I think, you know, when we're all telling him we're doing stuff, but he knows in the long run that having a nine-to-five job [INAUDIBLE].  He's okay with that.  He can deal with it.
<b>DR:</b> You're not playing?
<b>PT:</b> No, not really.  I really don't have any time, and I really don't, there isn't nobody to play with.  I don't want to set up my drums and just play them.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, really, I wouldn't want to play drums for him.  I would like to do something business wise, the back end of it.  [INAUDIBLE].  That's what I want to do I just, it's very hard to get into that business unless you know somebody who can probably pay you close to nothing to get started so -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You've got to have a kind of sense about that stuff too, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You figure you have pretty good business sense?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do you?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, we did it with our band and, you know, did all the business and semi tours and stuff like that.  You know, [INAUDIBLE], we'll see.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, who's going to make it and who isn't?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, not many make it that's for sure.
<b>DR:</b> Years ago, an accountant that I had used for a while, um, the guy, this guy's name was [NAME OTHER] -
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Approached her and said, "Can you like be our accountant?"  She's like, "No you guys are too small."  [LAUGHING].  That was then.
<b>PT:</b> That was then, yeah, I can't imagine it now.
<b>DR:</b> She's like, "I think I might have made a mistake."  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Take a nice chuck of change off them.  Now, they, uh, yeah, they're blowing up now and now he's big himself, so -
<b>DR:</b> You never know.
<b>PT:</b> You never know, that's true.  You never know.  That's for sure.
<b>DR:</b> If you really wanted to do it, I would assume you'd have to go hang out at clubs and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I think the main thing is you got to go, you've got to move, I would have to move to [DEIDENTIFIED] with a different job to get, for six months to get to know people and that type of stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm willing to do that.  I don't need to make a bunch of money I just need to find a job that's going to be okay because I got to pay rent and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> That's why she has a stable job, right?
<b>PT:</b> That's right, that's what I tell her.  That's why she can do it.
<b>DR:</b> You guys looking to make this long term anytime soon?
<b>PT:</b> Maybe soon, maybe within the next year we might be engaged.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Probably sooner than later, I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Your health's been okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, been fine.  I haven't been sick in a while.  Knock on wood.
<b>DR:</b> Still on your Adderall?
<b>PT:</b> Yep, still take that and then um, that's it.
<b>DR:</b> How much you taking now?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, usually about a half a day.
<b>DR:</b> Just once a day?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, just in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> Kind of gets you on the right track?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't know how people could take a bunch of that in one day.  I wouldn't ever sleep.  I just take about a half a day.
<b>DR:</b> Seems like as we get older we don't need as much.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't, I don't think so either, but, yeah, it does good for me, just a little bit, a half in the morning is fine.  And it wears off so I can go to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> It lasts most of the day for you still?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, because I'm usually going non stop so that usually, my adrenaline and I guess that, I'm fine, so that's about all I take.  And I don't take like Klonopin or that, uh, [INAUDIBLE], whatever that was.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Don't need that now.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And you kind of got the other OC stuff under control.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You recognize it when it happens and -
<b>PT:</b> Yep, yes.  I think believe that's the main thing, just recognize it, taking control of it, so.
<b>DR:</b> Right, got to fight it.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> Your girlfriend, uh, did she used to notice, um, what's her name again?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER], right.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I keep calling her girlfriend.  [NAME OTHER], has she noticed that, you know, kind of stuff in the past and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, now, now everybody just says I'm a big planner, you know, um, be on time, this, that and a lot of them are like I wish I had that quality so it's not necessarily a bad thing, so -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Be on time and very I got to go at this time and blah, blah, blah.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, no, but that's about it.  No jumping around and stuff like that off the wall.
<b>DR:</b> But as far as routine, I mean you're real -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, I'm routine, definitely have my routine but some people probably wish they had routines and they don't so -
<b>DR:</b> The difference between success and failure mostly is that people procrastinate and don't do well and people that don't follow through and plan, you know, end up having to do things at the last minute and it shows they did it at the last minute.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, like my boss says I'm so flawless on the back end of our business.  I'm like that's probably because I'm OCD and everything else and -
<b>DR:</b> Yep.
<b>PT:</b> Got to be done and got to get this done, got to get this done.  I do it early rather than late and -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Just the way I am and so it works in my business.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> It works.
<b>DR:</b> So it's not OCD in a way that it's interfering with you life?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, you go home at the end of the day and you don't go back over everything.
<b>PT:</b> No.  No, it's just I get it done and it's very all on top of it all the time.  So, yes, it's a good way to look at it.
<b>DR:</b> Your office is pretty organized?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, all that type stuff and um, you know, tickets are closed out and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> That's, that's, so I got it, that personality and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's the way I do things.
<b>DR:</b> You getting away this summer?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, probably we're busy, weddings, and I guess I'm coming to the age where everybody is getting married, but got a bunch of weddings and then um, [DATE] we'll probably do something and go to the lake.  But no major plans, I never really go big, big trips.
<b>DR:</b> No?
<b>PT:</b> I'd rather take Thursday, Friday, longer weekends rather than take a whole two week and spend a bunch of money, so.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> That's what I like to do.
<b>DR:</b> No, that's, I think that's perfectly reasonable.  You go listen to much music around town?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, whatever bands I, like I listen to a lot.  Yeah.  You know, my friend, um, works for [DEIDENTIFIED] so -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Go to a bunch of those shows and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He has to go to all of them, so I go.
<b>DR:</b> Now, there's your opening isn't it?
<b>PT:</b> Well, he, and he can't, there's just no [DEIDENTIFIED] jobs right now there.  It's just, I think the economy if it was two years from now or two years ago there would have been tons of jobs.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know, he can transfer like that to that theater or coliseum near [DEIDENTIFIED] and then get me a job.  But it's just not like that right now.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] well, they seem to be getting bigger.
<b>PT:</b> They're huge, yeah.  They're big, they're just, now they're not using Ticketmaster, they're using [DEIDENTIFIED] to sell tickets.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> Because they've got the exclusives too, don't they?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum, yep, exclusive rights -
<b>DR:</b> With bands?
<b>PT:</b> With bands.
<b>DR:</b> With specific bands and I mean -
<b>PT:</b> Like Madonna, they gave her 120 million bucks -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] her everything, so.  I guess it works.
<b>DR:</b> Madonna gave them -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think one of the, I think they paid her to have the -
<b>DR:</b> For the rights.
<b>PT:</b> For the next 10 years or something.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And now they have her career, just like they did with all these other bands.  They do, give them a bunch of money.  We control touring, merchandising, everything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's production company and promotion.
<b>DR:</b> So they'll be in charge of the recording even.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, to a certain extent.  I think now, that's the only thing that they're not.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Touching as much.  Anything to do with the band, business side, legal side, promotions, touring, t-shirts -
<b>DR:</b> Where are they headquartered?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED], yep, [DEIDENTIFIED] has got the big country thing and then he works here in [DEIDENTIFIED] off [DEIDENTIFIED].  They have a [DEIDENTIFIED] office.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]  But, the next [INAUDIBLE] is in [DEIDENTIFIED].  His office is technically out of [DEIDENTIFIED], I guess.  But he works out of here.  He has to go up there every show -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So [DEIDENTIFIED] wouldn't be where you'd go?
<b>PT:</b> I like [DEIDENTIFIED].  I've been for two weeks and I could see myself there, but [NAME OTHER] really don't want to go there.  She never been there.  I think it's just bigger than [DEIDENTIFIED], way, way bigger.
<b>DR:</b> A little bit.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and [DEIDENTIFIED] still got the [DEIDENTIFIED] feel but with the southern charm, I guess.  They're both very similar with the people and the music, the arts and stuff, but just more southern in [DEIDENTIFIED] than, uh -
<b>DR:</b> You've got to know some people and get your way around.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  I know, my brother travels too and he relays a lot of information to me.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  I'm glad you're healthy too, making plans for your future.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, now is the time to do it I guess.  I'm [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> Well, you ought to not lock you into anything.  You've already talked about buying a place but that would be -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just don't want to commit to something like that right now.  Marriage is one thing because she is willing to do whatever -
<b>DR:</b> She going with you anyway.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, anyway, so that doesn't change much, it's just [INAUDIBLE].  I just don't know where I'll be in five years.
<b>DR:</b> Going to be here in a year?
<b>PT:</b> Um, maybe.  I'd love not to be but maybe.  If everything went as planned, no, but -
<b>DR:</b> Any other options besides music?
<b>PT:</b> Not really, just stick with [DEIDENTIFIED] probably.  Because it's a really good job and -
<b>DR:</b> Good company.
<b>PT:</b> It's just [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You need any, uh, scripts while you're here?
<b>PT:</b> Um, probably just the Adderall.  And that's it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And you're on no other medications currently are you?
<b>PT:</b> Nope.  I've been [INAUDIBLE] Allegra, I don't like that anymore either.
<b>DR:</b> You're in the south, how you get by without Allegra?
<b>PT:</b> I know.  Occasionally I have to take something but very rare.  We were moving and dust but besides that, that was it.  Not taking any of that.
<b>DR:</b> So come football -
