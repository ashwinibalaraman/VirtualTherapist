BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] make her do one semester and [NAME OTHER] will have enough credits to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, um, [INAUDIBLE].  She's just not going to work out in the other school.  There's just too many temptations.  I mean she had already gotten, by the time she's been in a month, she has [INAUDIBLE], you know, the whole deal one.  She didn't even really bump me on it.  It's almost like it's okay.  This is what I want too.  So, I went down and I talked to the school and I was very honest with them.  I just said listen, you know, I just want to save this kid.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	I said, you know, I just want this child to survive.  She's almost, you know, within just a few months, [NAME OTHER] will turn [AGE] in April.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I said, you know, and she's going to be out of my hands.  She can walk away from me at [AGE], you know, and, and her life can just go down the tubes, you know.  So I was real straight with them about it, and I think they appreciated it, and I think, you should have seen the relief on the woman's face when I said, because she was talking about, you know, how long's this going to last, and is she going to be out all year, and I said I'm just going to tell you the truth, I went 1 semester and she's not coming back, and the woman's face just kind of lit up.  It was like [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	I said, you know, if I can just get this kid 3 credits, she can go to the, um, the middle college program and that's where she needs to be.
<b>DR:</b>	That'll be next year then?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, no, it'll start the first, well next, in January.
<b>DR:</b>	It will?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Um, well see because the semester—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	She's just short a semester.
<b>DR:</b>	So you've been through all that then?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I talked to them, and the counselor's going to help me.  She lost her daughter, so I've had to kind of, she lost her daughter to cancer a couple of weeks ago, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Who's the counselor?  The counselor at her primary school?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Um, [NAME OTHER] her name.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	So she said that she'd try to help me get [NAME OTHER] set up for the program and all that, but I think that's what [NAME OTHER] really needs.  [NAME OTHER] is smart enough to do it on her own.  She's a [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, the lady that's coming to the house, [NAME OTHER] not as crazy about as she was the teacher last year.
<b>DR:</b>	Does she give her a hard time?
<b>PT:</b>	No, she's doing okay.
<b>DR:</b>	That's good.
<b>PT:</b>	This woman, um, had a son that committed suicide, a teenage son that committed suicide, so she's kind of up on depression, but she's, um—
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  There's just small tragedies all around, aren't there?
<b>PT:</b>	But, um, this woman's a little, a little bit different.  She's kind of, you know, she asked me immediately, she had never been in my house and she said do you have any dogs, and I said yeah.  She said can you lock them up?  So immediately [NAME OTHER] didn't like that, but we did [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	You keep saying that.  Why is that?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I just, I worry.  You know, I worry about [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	But you say that she's going to be all right.
<b>PT:</b>	I think she's doing better.  I feel good about it.  Um, she had something happen this week.  She just, NA has been a real bummer for her.  I mean NA, she has had just constant, she had the one, um, mentor sponsor that relapsed after 3 years.  Bam, right after she started with [NAME OTHER] and then [NAME OTHER] got another one that was doing pretty good, but [NAME OTHER] is so highly demand.  I mean she just demands so much.  The woman just told her, she said I can't keep up with you, you know.  I carried you as far as I can.  She bailed on her, but I really, as soon as [NAME OTHER] came, [NAME OTHER] was crying because this girl was mean to her, and, um, as soon as [NAME OTHER] came in, I sat [NAME OTHER] down.  I said it's okay.  I said it's all right.  I said you need some friends [NAME OTHER].  I said you don't just need a sponsor.  Yes, you need that, but you need friends—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	To go through life.  You know, you need to be a teenager.  You need to have fun, and, um, the very next day it pushed [NAME OTHER] to move.  You know, she was real attached to that youth pastor from the church we were going to, but it pushed [NAME OTHER] to call the new, the new youth pastor of where we're going now, wife who is bipolar.  Um, her husband was an alcoholic, but I mean they've been clean for 20 years, and they've been, they're very, very, um, experienced youth pastors and she really likes [NAME OTHER].  She was a cutter.  I mean she is right up [NAME OTHER] alley, and she told [NAME OTHER], she said I'll talk to you every day.  She said I stay home, she said and I want you to call me every single day and we'll just talk.
<b>DR:</b>	How old is she?
<b>PT:</b>	She's, um, she's not real young.  She's probably [AGE], but I mean she really wants to be [NAME OTHER] friend, but she's got daughters the same age as [NAME OTHER] who are reaching out to [NAME OTHER] too.  So [NAME OTHER] going on, um—
<b>DR:</b>	What is her history?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, what you mean?
<b>DR:</b>	The woman.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, that's who I was talking about.  She was a cutter.  She was bipolar, or is bipolar.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, what about substances and?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I think she's done some drugs when she was younger.  She was raped.  Um, so she's, and she's been, um, locked up several times.  She's gone to different places like [DEIDENTIFIED] or whatever.  This has been several years, for depression, and so she really has got a good grip on where [NAME OTHER] at.
<b>DR:</b>	Hm.
<b>PT:</b>	So she may really, really be good for [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	You know, you have a real open mind.  You know, most parents, if we were to say, we have this woman with that background who's going to be talking with your daughter, they'd be like I don't think so.
<b>PT:</b>	I love her.  I really do.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	She's been—
<b>DR:</b>	But you have such an open mind because you know where, where she's coming from—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And you know that because somebody that's been able to succeed after that has got a lot of, a lot of empathy.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she does.
<b>DR:</b>	A lot of insight.
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] respects her.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, um, [NAME OTHER] doesn't feel judged by her.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	So [NAME OTHER] open to what she has to say.  Whereas [NAME OTHER] will immediately shut you down if you don't know, if you don't understand why she does what she does.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	Well now who does?  Who understands what, why she, she doesn't.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm beginning to think maybe I do.  Maybe I'm wacky.  [LAUGHING].  She's, she's doing good, fair at being a normal teenager I think.  Um, I don't know if the medicine works so much anymore.  Maybe she's just going to be that doggone moody too, but she's pushing me away which I want her to do because she needs to do, but she's, um, she gets very grouchy.
<b>DR:</b>	All the time?
<b>PT:</b>	All the time.
<b>DR:</b>	Is she taking her medicine?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	We're sure about that?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  She, [NAME OTHER] like me.  She's a real [INAUDIBLE].  I mean she's on the honor society, straight As, you know.  They're good about the rule.  The rule is take 2 a day.  [NAME OTHER] is going to take 2 a day.
<b>DR:</b>	Well the rule is also to be nice.  Can you tell her that?  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  I'm just so moody.
<b>PT:</b>	She is a grouch bucket, and—
<b>DR:</b>	Just with you, or with everyone?
<b>PT:</b>	She's getting that way with everybody.  She, she's pretty grouchy.
<b>DR:</b>	Is it affecting her friendships?
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] does, I don't know.  [NAME OTHER] has more friends than [NAME OTHER] does, but [NAME OTHER] can be so demanding too that she runs her friends off too.
<b>DR:</b>	Boy?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, a boy that she likes that used to like her that don't like her anymore.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	So, she got her little heart crush, but I told her, I said hey, I said, you know, boys come and boys go.  It's his loss.  Let him go.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Big deal, you know.  You're beautiful.
<b>DR:</b>	She'd take him back in a heartbeat though, right?  She'd take him back in a heartbeat?
<b>PT:</b>	You know, at first I think she would have, but she's tougher than me.  She's, and I'm, I'm loving that because I was always that way [INAUDIBLE] [NAME OTHER] I'll fix you, come back, you know, let me, let me fix you back.  You know, you just need to be loved.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I've been loving all my life.  She's tougher than I am.  She, you know, they have 8th grade dances.  She dances with every boy there right in front of him and I loved it.  I said you go girl.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  So grades are good?
<b>PT:</b>	Grades are good.
<b>DR:</b>	And socially she's out there and?
<b>PT:</b>	She's out there.  She's, you know, [INAUDIBLE] a little bit, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Is she sleeping?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] sleeping.  I mean she still really struggles with sleeping.  I don't know what we're going to do, hit her in the head with a hammer I reckon.
<b>DR:</b>	Because that's a big part of how we feel the next day, you know, without sleeping.
<b>PT:</b>	It might be.  It might be just a sleeping thing.  She goes to sleep finally, but she struggles to get to sleep.  You got her on that Rozerem.
<b>DR:</b>	It's not working, huh?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Sonata didn't work.  Rozerem doesn't work.
<b>PT:</b>	And you know what, you might be [INAUDIBLE], um, now that you say that, it reminds me of something.  I haven't been sleeping really well just because of the pain in my back, and I know that, um, for the last few nights she was talking in her sleep a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I guess that means you're not really sleeping if you can talk in your sleep, but it's crazy stuff.  I don't know what the heck she's talking about, but, you know, she's talking in her sleep a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	She's not on, uh, just Rozerem at night now?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	The, the Valium we gave her before stop working?
<b>PT:</b>	Yep, that one didn't work.
<b>DR:</b>	Have we tried anything else?  Ambien or Restoril.  When she gets to sleep, does she wake up?
<b>PT:</b>	No, she's been pretty good with that once she goes to sleep.  I think she sleeps through the night all right.  It's just that talking that she's been doing [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	How long does the Vyvanse last?  Give it in the morning.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, she's doing okay with that.  Um, I haven't seen, [INAUDIBLE] with [NAME OTHER] because I don't make her take it on the weekends and that kind of stuff because she doesn't like it.  She hates it and it doesn't, she doesn't like what it does to her.
<b>DR:</b>	What does it do?
<b>PT:</b>	Well it makes her behave.
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	She, she says it makes her not respond.  She's not [INAUDIBLE] because she's not hyper.
<b>DR:</b>	Well is she less, uh, cranky when she's on it?  If you're not sure, give it on the weekend and see.
<b>PT:</b>	All right, I'll try.
<b>DR:</b>	Because if that's the case, then, uh, then she has to stay on it 7 days a week and you might even give it to her [INAUDIBLE] to last all day.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	Because if all the crankiness is just frustration, tolerance and impatience.
<b>PT:</b>	It may be that she's less cranky in the morning than she is in the afternoon I think the more I think about it, and the afternoons because I say really involve [INAUDIBLE] I've got to be really on top of them or [INAUDIBLE] and I learned that from [NAME OTHER].  So, and I'm very much involved in everything they do.  When they come home from school, I want to know [INAUDIBLE] what happened at school today?  You know, what's going on with [INAUDIBLE].  You know, what's happening?
<b>DR:</b>	They hate that though.  They hate you asking all those questions.
<b>PT:</b>	She used to love it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but not now.
<b>PT:</b>	She may be, she may be backing off.  That may be part of it, and maybe she, if she wants me let go, then I, I—
<b>DR:</b>	It's not so much even that.  It's just about the school day.  They're like I don't want to talk about school.
<b>PT:</b>	That's when she's the most cranky is when—
<b>DR:</b>	After school.
<b>PT:</b>	When I'm talking about what happened to her at school, but I'm trying to be involved.  I want to know who she's hanging with, what she's doing.
<b>DR:</b>	But you're going to have to do in a less direct way.
<b>PT:</b>	Maybe I'm invading it too much.
<b>DR:</b>	I only say that because I mean she's got a brain that takes all this stuff in like we've talked about before—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	She gets bored and, um, in the morning, I'm sure she's not so great, but as the day goes on, her brain gets fuller and fuller with all this stuff, and she gets over stimulated, and by the end of the day her brain is just, it's just over—
<b>PT:</b>	It might be because [NAME OTHER] is a perfectionist.
<b>DR:</b>	It's pretty intense for her all day, and then when she gets home.  I mean you're not, it could be over stimulation.  It could be just the TV's up too loud, the radio or you could just ask her, uh, you know, if there's something that was nice outside or something that she could blow up, but it could always be just that last little thing to set her off.  Most kids at the end of the school day need to take a nap.
<b>PT:</b>	And she does a lot of naps.  She'll pass out.
<b>DR:</b>	That's, that's probably, uh, the best thing to do.
<b>PT:</b>	I might be invading her space too much.
<b>DR:</b>	It's not that you're invading it.  It's that, like I said, you can just turn the TV up, just, just the stimulation.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  [NAME OTHER] is very intense.  Um, she has to miss yesterday at school and she wanted to go.  She was running a fever and coughing.  I mean barking.  The kid was really, really sick and I took her to, to the doctor and she missed 2 days for the same thing last week and I made her stay out of school.  The kid was really sick.  She's running a fever, and she's sick.
<b>DR:</b>	And she, and she wants to go.
<b>PT:</b>	And she wants to go.  And she's really, she was very irritated with me, very mad at me.
<b>DR:</b>	She didn't want to get behind.
<b>PT:</b>	She was, she had 3 tests, and she said I have to take these tests, and I said [NAME OTHER] number 1, you're taking narcotic cough medicine.  I said do you really want to get in there and fail a test that you're not, you know, that your brain's not clear for.  I said, you know, you're an A student.  And then she was still ready to go.  The doctor [INAUDIBLE].  She said you can't go to school today.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm going to try her on some Ambien and see if that helps different, and you can let me know next week.  Take her off the Rozerem because that's obviously not working.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But a lot of kids like out there, they're just, their brain just and they just can't shut it off at night to fall asleep.  They're always thinking something.
<b>PT:</b>	You know what, she really can't.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	When she, when she goes to bed at night, after a half hour or so if she's still awake, if you go in there to talk to her, would she, uh, happy to talk with you or would she tell you to get out?
<b>PT:</b>	She'd be grouchy.
<b>DR:</b>	Would she?  She'd tell you to bug off.  I want to sleep?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Would she?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  When she does sleep, she sleeps.  When she sleeps, she sleeps a lot once she goes.  Like today, you're taking, uh, cough syrup that's making her sleepy, like she slept today.  She went to bed last night at like 11:00 and I woke her up at 12:00 today.
<b>DR:</b>	Catching up, huh?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So, and she'll do it on the weekend.  She'll sleep like that.
<b>DR:</b>	But you're pretty good, huh?  You said that you were feeling better than the last time we talked?
<b>PT:</b>	I am feeling better.  Well I had the one panic attack and you increased the medicine and that's what I really needed.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I needed what you're giving me, and, um, because I woke up and it was really, really bad.  It was one of the worse ones that I had ever had.  I mean it was, I mean I was standing—
<b>DR:</b>	It's pretty scary.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it was horrible.  I mean I [INAUDIBLE] and it came out [INAUDIBLE] right in the middle of the night, and, um, I'm trying to keep it together because I'm crawling off.  [NAME OTHER] on one side of the bed.  I don't want to wake up [NAME OTHER].  So I got to crawl down the end of the bed.  I'm trying to get out of bed and I think I'm having a heart attack, and it was pretty bad, but, um, I took 2 of those pills at the same time again.
<b>DR:</b>	And you think you're having a heart attack?
<b>PT:</b>	I did know what it was this time.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I was going to say I hope if you think you have a heart attack, you would wake him up.  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  I, I did know what it was.  I knew when I broke out in a sweat and I would know, the pills work for me so well, I know that in a few minutes I can feel the difference.  So if I hadn't felt that different, I would have known that I was really having a heart attack.  And I'm in good health.  They've done, you know, they've done the whole thing on me.  It was not the heart.  There's nothing wrong with my heart and nothing wrong with, I don't have asthma.
<b>DR:</b>	How's your energy?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, it's making me tired.  So, um—
<b>DR:</b>	What is?
<b>PT:</b>	I guess all of it.  You know, I'm taking what you give me.  I'm taking, you know, pain pills, and, um, but at this point, I called, um, either last week or the week before [NAME OTHER].  I called him and I said listen this caught me completely by surprise.  Um, I had to fill out some paperwork [INAUDIBLE] tell him what kind of medications I take.  So I got ready to write down yours and I thought, you know, this is worker's comp I'm involved with and I thought—
<b>DR:</b>	Who wants to know about your medicines?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, the guy that's working, the surgeon that was going to do a test, and, because I thought I could just do this with you like we've always done it [INAUDIBLE] it's nobody's business what I'm talking to you about, and, um, so anyway, I realized that when I put that down that all of a sudden they might want my, you know, records from you.
<b>DR:</b>	They would.
<b>PT:</b>	So I called up my attorney and she said well [PATIENT NAME] you know, they might and I busted out in tears with her.  I said look I don't think you know something.  I've known this man for 10 years.  I've told him everything.  I said, you know, I've went in there, I said this guy's a friend.  I said I completely trust him.  There's nothing that I, I would not tell him.  I said they can't, I said they put me on the stand and they make me start talking about what happened to me when I was a teenager, I'm going to, I will drop everything.  I said I'm telling you, I will lose it, and, um, she said well I'll do the best I can.  So I called up the office and I said look here, I came in here not knowing that and I said and he can't help me if he doesn't know the truth.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  And, uh, we don't give your record out unless you tell us to.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and, um, so she said that you would make sure that they didn't get anything.  It's not that I care that they know what I'm doing now.  It's the things I don't want them to know—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean there are things I haven't even told you yet.  I mean I was raped and I didn't tell you about that.  You know, but, so I've had some—
<b>DR:</b>	You just throw these things out.  Oh, by the way.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  You know I've had a lot of junk in my life.  You already know that.  And that's it.  It's that kind of stuff.  It's none of their business.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean, for what?  That was a long ago.  I buried that.  That stuff is dead anyway, so, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Is it?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Relative?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my grandfather, step grandfather, the most wicked piece of that day is part of what's caused me to be the mother that I am.  He also raped my mother, and my mother took me and left me there to live with him, and, um, of course, he, you know, couldn't keep his hands off me either.
<b>DR:</b>	Wonder what was she thinking?
<b>PT:</b>	My mother hates me, but that's okay.  That's her problem.  It took me years to get there too.  That's her own problem.  She had me at [AGE].  I destroyed her childhood.  She blamed me for that, and you know, that's, that's her problem.  You know, I'm a bright person, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't help how she feels, and I can't help what she did and it's very, very, you know, then molested, raped, I mean that stuff is sick enough as it is, and if somebody touched one of my kids, I'd kill them, and you know that.  So to me, to be a mother and deliberately expose your child to that, it, it's sick.  So I don't even speak to her.  I don't have anything to do with her, but you know, it's that kind of stuff that I, at the time I couldn't remember, I said did I tell him that, and that, that was what I was really freaking out about because I mean that's, that's really personal, and it's still sore, you know.  I buried it.  The little sucker's dead.
<b>DR:</b>	How old were you then?
<b>PT:</b>	[AGE], [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  A Man of the cloth, huh?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, a preacher too.  Reckon he's burning in hell.
<b>DR:</b>	Karma, I think karma exists.  I think we get what [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I think he's burning in hell.  He's right in there with my batterer, but anyway, you know, I let all that go, and I really have overcome a lot of that stuff.  I just wouldn't want to have to be, because it has nothing to do with my injuries or anything that's happened to me now.  I was a kid.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean, and it would just be dirty, stinking dirty for them to bring that up in front of, you know, a jury or whatever, which she doesn't think it's ever going to go to a jury, but if it were, it would really hurt to have to, to say that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well we're not going to go there.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.  I know.
<b>DR:</b>	It's got nothing to do with anything.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I am who I am and I've been where I've been and I survived all of that.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you falling asleep in the day?  You said you're kind of tired?
<b>PT:</b>	I am.  I do, and, but, um, they've actually called in, they want me to sleep now.  They did the discogram because the pain got way worse and they said it would, that it could, and, um, I go tomorrow and I'm going to talk to the surgeon.  I don't know what I'm going to do.
<b>DR:</b>	Why has it gotten worse?
<b>PT:</b>	They said once they start sticking those discs that the pain could, it may, it might be temporary, but I mean it's right in my legs [INAUDIBLE] and I just, I can't hardly walk [INAUDIBLE] so I'm jacking that up, but, uh, so they want me to sleep.  She said sleep.  She said if you can sleep through this until we can get you in here and decide what we're going to do with you, sleep, just sleep.
<b>DR:</b>	So we're still looking at surgery I guess?
<b>PT:</b>	Still an option.  Unless they can come up with something else.  I mean I really hurt.
<b>DR:</b>	I know, you can't continue like this.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.  I mean it's, it's ruined everything for me.  I mean it is, it's taken me, and you know, away from everything with the kids.  It's destroyed my sex life, which I mean it's just real sad because right now I've got a great relationship.  That rascal, he's so wonderful.  You know, I miss my horse so bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	He went and took a truckload of dirt and packed down in front of, um, my horse's stall so I could go to the gate, and took me down there for a surprise.  I love that man.  He's so good to me.  When I hadn't seen him in all of these years since I seen my [INAUDIBLE] walk in the sand.  We're walking to the gate and I said [INAUDIBLE] Well he come running.  I was like oh my God, he's coming [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].  So I got to see him.  I can't handle him.  I can't pull him out or anything, but I got to see him, but [NAME OTHER] took good care of him, and he's going to go with me tomorrow when I talk to the doctor.  You know, if they could just stop the pain some kind of way without having to do that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And they said there's a lot of different things.  I couldn't handle traction and they say traction might get the discs back in, but they've got really good pictures on the discogram, but the discogram came back negative.  Check this out.  I go and they're thinking, they're taking pictures on the discogram and I'm thinking and that's where they're going to run the dye through your back and they stick the needles in them.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, and no matter how bad it is, I'm staying on this table.  You know me.  When I set my mind to it—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm going to do it if it shoots me, and so I'm laying there, I said just give me a pillow, and they said you sure you're going to be okay?  I said yep, give me a pillow.  I'm, I'm face down.  I'm gripping the pillow, which I almost ripped in half, and, um, and they hit my back and man, the pain started.  And they said are you okay?  And I kept saying okay, which I'm about to die, but I'm saying okay because I'm thinking that he's getting the best pictures and the better I can stand it, the better picture he's going to get.  Well because I stood the pain so well, and I was able to do it without pulling the things out of my back, he says oh, that makes the test negative.  And I said, I don't think you get it.  I said a 10 to me is having a baby without an epidural—Which I've done twice.
<b>DR:</b>	A discogram, it's an [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	It's a, they stick needles in your back.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Into the actual, um, um, disc, and they, they pump it up with fluid dye—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And then they watch the dye flow through.
<b>DR:</b>	But that's got nothing to do with you enduring pain.  I mean it either is or it isn't.
<b>PT:</b>	Well they put it, it should recreate your pain, which it did, and I, he knows it did.  He's saying that it did, but he's saying that it should have faster than I said that it did.  In other words, I should have had more severe pain—
<b>DR:</b>	That's subjective.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, because pain for one person is not another.  That's subjective.  I mean—
<b>PT:</b>	That's exactly what the nurse said too.  She said, she said the surgeon's going to talk to you about it.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, that's, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	She said just because you can endure more pain than the average Joe—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  That doesn't mean—
<b>PT:</b>	And I told her, and I said, you know, I've had 2 babies without an epidural, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt.
<b>PT:</b>	I delivered [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	I don't know, does it?  But you didn't, see that's a good point.  You didn't have epidurals.  Does that mean, uh, you had a painless childbirth?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	No, the nurse was actually walking around [INAUDIBLE].  I'm about to pass out.  I'm in so much pain and they're walking, what's all that sticky stuff on the floor?  Your blood pressure's really going up, you know.  This is terrible.  They get through and they look down and there's an epidural laying on the floor leaking everywhere and I'm like oh God.  Yeah, hurt a little bit.  Can I have my baby now?
<b>DR:</b>	[COUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	Lucky me, huh?
<b>DR:</b>	And you probably hurt a lot.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but you know, I feel, I still think that, you know, I feel good about who I am and, and where I am in life, you know.  And if they could just stop this back pain, I'd be okay.
<b>DR:</b>	It weigh you down.
<b>PT:</b>	It does weight you down, but it makes you stronger too, you know.  I mean the things that have happened to me with my grandfather and all, it made me a much more protective mother, and—
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sure.
<b>PT:</b>	And that's probably why I've been overprotective with the kids.  That's why when I remember they asked me if I ever thought [NAME OTHER] had been sexually abused when all this first started happening.
<b>DR:</b>	[COUGHING].  That'll, that'll get to you.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh man, my blood just boiled up and I thought oh my God.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	The only thing I can ever think is would my mother have actually ever hurt [NAME OTHER] because when they were little, they did see my mother.  And I know if you've been sexually abused that you can grow up to be a sexual offender.  I know that, and I thought God, if I knew that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I told, I told [INAUDIBLE] I said you checked me out.  You checked [NAME OTHER] out, but I stayed home with these children, and to my knowledge, it would have never happened, but if you find out it did, you better tell all my friends.  You better tie my down.  You better lock me up because I'm going to kill somebody.  I am going to take them out if they hurt my children.
<b>DR:</b>	You'll take it out on yourself the worst though.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  I'm better than I was that last time with the whole situation with [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] and everything probably because I'm able to deal with it better because of the medication.  I think the medication has helped me tremendous, tremendously.  I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	How often do you take Klonopin now?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm taking 8 day.  You told me to take 8 a day, and that's what I'm taking.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, 2 at a time?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I'm going to give you some more of those.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I think I'm okay for a couple of weeks.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you?
<b>PT:</b>	I think.  Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Well if you're taking 2 at a time every time, we should just get you 1 mg ones next time too.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  I just like the wafer.  I like the wafer kind that melts because it works right away.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And it, it's really helped my ability and I told you I had such a problem with being able to tolerate [INAUDIBLE] but see the reason, I didn't know how to take it then, but I do now because I understand what I'm doing.  Um, I would start, my chest would start getting tight.  That's what I was talking about.  I've had, you know, I started getting a tight chest.
<b>DR:</b>	Makes sense.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm sweating, you know, I'm doing the whole thing and that's what I was trying to say to you when I was saying I can't tolerate what I used to tolerate.  I just didn't know how to put that.
<b>DR:</b>	That makes sense.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And so now when I start feeling it, which I'm taking, um, first thing in the morning and I know how to kind of space them, you know, 1 about lunch, 1 about afternoon and 1 right before, or, or 2.  So I'm taking 2 at a time, so I'm taking 2 before I go to bed.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Because [INAUDIBLE] happening.
<b>DR:</b>	And the Pristiq's okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And no problem with that taking 1 of those a day.
<b>DR:</b>	One every day?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm still taking the Wellbutrin, which I was taking before.
<b>DR:</b>	The XL right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So I think I'm doing all right.
<b>DR:</b>	You look good.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm doing okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So I'll get to see the kids next week.  Good.
<b>PT:</b>	Yep.  I'll be back in.  So we'll have a better idea of what's going on with them, and then I'll be able to tell you what's going on with my surgery too if we're going to have to have it or not, but—
<b>DR:</b>	And you're not going to be, uh, stopping your medicine [INAUDIBLE] like you did the Trazodone [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Oh no.  I won't, I won't, I won't stop that because it's done too much for me.  I won't, and I know that I need it.
<b>DR:</b>	Even if you don't feel like it's helping, let me know first so we can do it right.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Gets you in trouble.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.  Well I mean I know what it's like to really different type of  MRI machine, I don't know that I ever did that before the MRI machine, but I know in that MRI machine, there it was truly a panic attack.  I mean I'm positive of that.  I like torn that machine up.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, no doubt.
<b>PT:</b>	And the guy's telling me the whole time, hold on [PATIENT NAME].  I'm on the way.  I'm coming in, I'm coming in.  And I mean I [INAUDIBLE] now.  I literally was sweating like a pig.  I mean and even with the Valium when I went back that day I could hardly stand it.  They gave me 2 mg Valium and I still could barely and when they did the discogram, I did it again and I had the girl sitting kind [INAUDIBLE].  She said oh, we can give you a Valium.  I said the heck with that Valium, give, I want my medicine.  [LAUGHING].  Give it to me.
<b>DR:</b>	You know it works.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  She said is this a new medicine?  I said I have no idea—[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well you take care of yourself.  You got plans for the night?  Heading home?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm just going to go home and see who wins this election.  And I hope that whoever does will take care of our kids.
<b>DR:</b>	That'd be nice.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That would be nice.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	No, I'd take care of that.
<b>PT:</b>	Good.
