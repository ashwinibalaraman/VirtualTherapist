My departure from the hospital was accomplished with
feelings of hope and anticipation, overlaid with fear. My
initial decline had happened so quickly and so unexpectedly
that I was in constant fear that it might happen again.


I was accepted back into the doctoral program at the university,
and shortly thereafter I was offered a job as a psychologist
at a residential treatment center for handicapped
children. As time passed I began to regain some confidence,
to enjoy living again. My dissertation topic had been accepted
at the university, and I was busy trying to bring it
together for final writing. At the same time I was working
at the center evaluating children, consulting with parents
and teachers and beginning to learn something of therapy
with disturbed and cerebrally damaged children.


Though I was working productively and learning new
skills, I was still periodically assailed by attacks of anxiety,
depression, and lethargy. The attacks came without warning
and without apparent precipitating causes. I still suffered
the fear of again failing to keep my equilibrium, of again
losing my ability to be a responsible, productive human

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>To be alone</b>


I think something like this must have happened at one
time or another to everyone. You're in bed at night with the
lights out waiting to go to sleep. You are casting mentally
about in a rather aimless fashion when at the edge of awareness
you become sensitive to some uneasy feeling. As you
begin to look at the feeling, to try to make something of it,
you become aware that it is a feeling of loneliness, a distasteful
solitude. You come to realize that it's not just a
feeling of restlessness from boredom and inactivity; it's
your first real confrontation with the primary "curse" of the
human condition: "self-awareness" and "dreadful freedom."


This is a profound, and, for most, a decidedly uncomfortable
realization. At this point most of us push the feeling
away and deliberately begin to think of more bearable
things: how we are going to pay the house note, whether we
should buy a washing machine, or what we are going to say
to the first guy who gives us some lip in the conference

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I examine this feeling closely, I find three things
with which I must deal. One of them is that my life, what
it is and what it is to be, is my responsibility. It is not the
sum of the products of chance and heredity plus how I
happen to have been treated. You are what you have come
to be. No more and no less. And you have made this person
yourself.


The second component of this feeling is the vague realization
that life, your life, is temporal--that it <i>will</i> end. It is
essentially a confrontation with the certainty that someday
you will cease to be. But it is not just the conceptual realization
that you will die that provokes the fear and even panic
that some of us feel at these times. No, it is the inability to
accept this as a future event with no relevance for life to be
lived until the event. In short, we discover that we cannot
die! As Feifel, a psychologist who has studied the psychological
problems in death and dying, puts it, "And it is in
this same encounter with death that each of us discovers his
hunger for immortality." To live fully and freely, we must
concede our own demise and renounce immortality.


Now those who believe in some theological concept of
immortality need not be offended by these words. Because
it is not the notion of spiritual immortality that must be
renounced. This belief can be maintained without damage
to the personality. We must abandon our essential wish for
the perpetual continuation of a physical life. For this is what
we will not have.


People who are unable to do this have been characterized
as people who live their lives "as if"--as if life were going
to begin at some point in the future--"when I get my de-
gree," or "when Johnny gets out of the Army," or "when

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The third major component of this uncomfortable feeling
is probably the most critical of them all. This is the realization
of essential loneliness. Each of us is basically alone.
Love and companionship can make the terror of loneliness
bearable, but these things can't change the fact of "aloneness."
Here then we must again probably offend the people
who protest, "No, I'm never alone, Jesus (or Buddha, or
Mohammed, and so forth) is always with me." Yet the
contradictions in such persons are so evident that one can
scarcely bear to reveal them. We might only mention the
futility of the assumption that this existence is only preparation
for "real life," which begins after we abandon this
one. This is the "as if" philosophy that we have pointed out
to be an empty vessel that has no essence of life. This kind
of thinking also denies the fact and importance of our temporal
nature. This denial then prevents the confrontation
with our finiteness that is so necessary to life itself. Most
of all, the pitiful and cruel predicament that is ours when
we or someone we love must die is painful and permits no
resolution. It can be stated crudely like this: "This life is
temporary and is preparation for immortality, and this
glorious immortality will surely be given to my fine father
(or my infant daughter, or my good mother), who has died."

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"But if I believe this, then why do I feel this way!" This
paradox in feeling cannot be resolved and will be repressed
(in time) to serve always as a limiting constriction on our
freedom.


The fact is, as Feifel has found in his research on the
meaning of death, that "religious" people (professing a belief
in life after death) fear death more than do people who
have no such beliefs. This contradiction in behavior, as
opposed to professed belief, is a surface manifestation of
the torment within.


So then the vague feeling of "disease" that we opened
this chapter with is a combination of three facets of the
human condition that Allport has characterized as "dreadful
freedom," and which we may label as the "curse of
humanness." Briefly, these factors are:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. our unilateral responsibility for what we are, and what
we are to be.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. our finite nature <i>which will be coincided</i> by death.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. our essential condition of loneliness.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


1. our unilateral responsibility for what we are, and what
we are to be.


2. our finite nature <i>which will be coincided</i> by death.


3. our essential condition of loneliness.


<b>Self-determination</b>


Man has attempted in various ways through the ages to
deny his personal responsibility for what he is and what he
will come to be. He has put himself in the hands of the
"gods." He has bewailed and bemoaned his treatment at the
altar of "fate." He has accepted the assumptions of Freud,
and, oddly enough, some theologians, that his future is
"determined." Experiences over which he has no control
have charted his course, never to be changed. Some religious
sects have gone so far as to profess the belief that it's all
written down in some celestial book and that man's only
purpose in this life is to try to understand and accept what
must be.

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But another group of men concerned with this problem of
humanness have an idea which is at one and the same time
thrilling and terrifying. It is simple and profound--"we are
what we determine we will be." Another way of saying this
is that our involvement in life and our determination of our
values, our beliefs, and our commitments are the sum total
of what we are. Certain temporal and physical events are
determined or are governed by chance, but these things are
not the essence of our humanness. Only "I" can determine
what the essence of my humanness is and what it is to
become. And a part of this determination is my decision to
be "one with mankind," to be or not to be a part of the
potential humanness of all men. As John Donne puts it,
"Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in
mankind."


It is the realization and acceptance of the responsibility
for what we are that provokes a part of the "feeling of
dread" that constitutes what Sartre and others have called
man's existential awareness. Rollo May has said that man
is the "organism who makes certain values--prestige,
power, tenderness, love--more important than pleasure and
even more important than survival itself."


This kind of philosophy commits many in education,
government, and fields of psychology to the proposition not
only that man can "grow," can "become," can "develop,"
but that he is compelled "to become" or not, he is compelled
"to grow" or to atrophy. Shakespeare's works have survived
mainly because they have illustrated so vividly the essential
human dilemmas, and he so aptly illustrated the most important
of them all in a phrase that every schoolboy can
quote, "To be, or not to be? That is the question." And
every schoolboy knows at some level of awareness that this
phrase is important, but he probably doesn't yet know why.


We've talked about man's need to confront the fact of his

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"The loss of illusions and the discovery of identity,
though painful at first, can be ultimately exhilarating and
strengthening," says A. Maslow, a psychologist who has
helped others through their confrontation with humanness.
For those who maintain that man is a deterministic pawn,
Maslow goes on to say, "The Americans have learned that
political democracy and economic prosperity do not in
themselves solve any of the basic value problems. There is
no place else to turn but inward, to the self, as the locus of
values."


I wish to remind those who hold no brief for an "encounter
with others," or for an "involvement in mankind," that
man does not live by bread alone, but without bread he does
not live. Hungry, cold, oppressed, and cruelly treated people
have no time to consider what they are to be. We who fail
to help them have determined this for them; the essence of
this determination is that they will not become human.


The third "agony," then, of the human condition is
loneliness. Through our struggle with the other two primary
conditions--self-determination and temporality--we discover
the fact of our aloneness. The clear realization of what
aloneness really is probably is the most terrifying of all our
burdens. It is certainly the most difficult to think about and
to finally come to terms with. Death and self-determination
fade in their terror beside the certainty of our knowledge
that we are alone. C. P. Snow says, "Each of us is alone."

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The shallow man will never confront the human agonies
of self-awareness, temporality, and loneliness. And he will
never suffer the greatest pains, but he will never feel the
sublime joys. Man's emotional existence (which is the important
part of life) is apparently one of certain behavioral
reciprocals. Seemingly one cannot experience great delight
without having also experienced great pain. We probably
don't need to demonstrate this clinically or in the lab. We
need only to look around us. Who are the loving ones? Who
are those persons that "touch" us? Who are the compassionate
ones? Almost always they are those who have met
life with vitality and with a realization that the encounter
is real and is theirs to confront or ignore, and these people
have met pain, disappointment, death, rejection, fear, and
despair. But from these encounters they have gained the
reciprocal capacity to know joy, love, compassion, and human
fulfillment.


The most pitiful and awful of the fates of man is the
possibility of going through life without struggling, painfully
but joyfully, with the tasks of humanness which confront
each of us. The consequence of our failure to make this
confrontation is a personal, empty shallowness that will
condemn us to count out our hours and days "in quiet
desperation."


<b>Touch me not</b>


"First things first" is a folk adage known by most of us.
The validity of the adage has been demonstrated in each of
our lives. It's just a convenient way of observing that we
must tend to the basic requirements of any undertaking
before we can go on to the other responsibilities of the task.
Our task of personal emotional development is really no
different. We have to take care of the primary needs before

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Unfortunately, if these basic needs were never adequately
met, we may spend the rest of our lives in mostly inappropriate
attempts to satisfy them. I suggest "inappropriate
attempts" because the actions designed to satisfy the security
and comfort needs of the five-year-old look awkward,
uncomfortable, and unappealing when we see them manifested
almost unchanged in the thirty-year-old. But we
can't escape these demands. They will be satisfied or they
will serve as disguised motives for most of our actions in
later life, serving to subvert productive behavior and personality
growth.


Psychologists speak of basic needs or primary reinforcers,
using that term in its technical sense. The primary
reinforcers or needs for all humans are limited to just a few
things in our universe. For survival we need food, water, air,
and shelter. There are no other basic needs. That's all the
infant is born with as instinctive requirements for life. Of
course, in the process of supplying these needs, somebody
handles the baby, gives him his food and water, and makes
sure that his "shelter" is warm and dry. In a most primary
fashion, this caring behavior comes to be equated with the
supplying of life's basic needs. It is a "hand" that gives food
and water, and a "face" and "voice" that accompany the
act. Hands and arms and soft breasts protect and repair and
soothe the ravages to the baby's shelter, which is his body.
Air and the accompanying breathing process seldom assume
much value as a reinforcing agent because they are automatically
available and are seldom, or never, associated
with a "giving" person.


Then life's basic needs come to be associated with acts
performed by a person or persons. The satisfactions or dissatisfactions
of these needs soon become equivalent to our

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If you really feel that this formulation of how we carry
infantile needs into our adult life is far-fetched, observe the
importance, feeling, and ceremony that surround the acts of
eating and drinking as a social custom. Smoking as a directly
oral symbolic equivalent of getting basic sustenance is the
proof par excellence of this.


One physical behavior accompanying the supplying of
basic needs from the first instance is touching. In the beginning,
none of the life-sustaining behaviors can be accomplished
without touching. This essential touching is usually
elaborated into hugging, kissing, rocking, fondling, caressing,
and other physical acts that culminate in close and
prolonged bodily contact. Then touching comes to be an
elaboration of and equivalent to the provision of food,
water, and bodily comfort. In fact, for most of us, touching
serves as the most direct reinforcing behavior in our lives,
and of course usually the act of touching is accompanied by
feelings. Sometimes this touching is received with warmth
and pleasure, but often it is repulsed and despised in a
manifestation of the most primary rejection of human interaction.


<b>The ways we are touched</b>


I did not want to be touched. I shuddered inwardly when
a friend put an arm on my shoulder or when a relative

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>A coming and a going</b>


The days working at the Children's Center grew to be
more routine and comfortable for me, if not more exciting.

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'd examine my two children, write my reports, and that
was my day. Sometimes it was a stressful job, although it
was also often boring. I wanted to do something else, learn
something more. My supervisor agreed to my request for
some new work, and she assigned me to develop a counseling
group for five mildly retarded teenage boys who were
discipline problems. In addition, I started therapy sessions
with two autistic children. One of these was a boy about
four years old. He was named Tommy. The other was a
pretty little girl of five named Tina.


Tommy and Tina were my real challenges. They were
severely autistic, had no usable speech, and were grossly
hyperactive. Any kind of relationship was highly threatening
to them. My therapy efforts consisted almost entirely of
trying to make contact with them. Both of them regarded
me as an object, not as a person. They would try to move
me out of their way as I would move a chair if it was in my
path. They would never make eye contact, and they would
not even react to any verbal efforts at communication on my
part. My attempts to make physical contact would cause
them to react with intense anxiety. If I managed to corner
one of them, they would respond with rage until they
managed to break free.


A year of twice weekly sessions with my boys' group and
individual sessions three times a week with Tommy and

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My boys didn't even make that much progress. At least
I didn't think they did. Every session was chaotic--survival
of the fittest. Imagine my surprise when two of the house
mothers at the boys' cottages told me, "You are really doing
wonders for those boys." To my amazement, they reported
that the boys were making better adjustments in their
"homes" and seemed to be happier and easier to get along
with.


I know that I learned at least one important lesson in my
efforts to help these children. I found that the first task of
any therapy procedure is to make meaningful contact with
my client, and I found that this was excruciatingly difficult.
People don't like to be touched when they are hurting. They
resist being touched both physically and emotionally. It's
ironic, but fitting, that I could not see that I resisted being
touched as vigorously as did those suffering kids.


At the end of my first year at the Children's Center, I was
offered a job as a psychologist in an agency serving exceptional
children in another state. The responsibilities of this
new job were similar to my work at the Children's Center.
However, now I was working with children in the public
schools and I was traveling all over the state. After our move
to a new home, I called the therapist recommended by the
hospital and began a new attempt to find myself with him.


Dr. Carl T. was a psychiatrist in private practice doing
therapy with individuals and with groups, and he agreed to

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After a year of weekly sessions, I still reacted to his overtures
of friendship with suspicion and polite correctness.
Occasionally his patience eroded under this treatment.


"Damn," he exclaimed one day. "I've called you Russell
for six months now. Why do you still call me Dr. T.?"


After a year of therapy, I still had not been "touched." It
never occurred to me that to be physically touched by anyone
was important, and I had not really been even emotionally
touched. My relationship with my therapist remained
cognitive and intellectual, and we focused on my life outside
the therapy hours. In a word, our relationship was
sterile, and it remained that way because we had not made
contact in any real sense. In retrospect, I can see that Carl
pushed in the direction of personalizing our relationship. He
tried to give me the opportunity to contact him. He offered
personal friendship and confidence, and he proved over and
over that he would be open to overtures from me. I resisted.
I insisted that he was my doctor, and I was his patient.
After all, we were two adults trying to attend to a problem,
weren't we? Now I know that we were an adult and a child
trying to meet the needs of a thirty-five-year-old infant.


And I insisted that we deal with my difficulties in an
objective, scientific way. After all, it was simply a matter of
uncovering unconscious resistances, feelings, and memories,
wasn't it? That's what Freud said anyhow. In reality, it was
necessary to make conscious certain aspects of the unconscious,
namely my intense need to be cared for and nurtured.
Finally one day we did that.


Our therapy hours had become dry and dull. I guess they
really always were. There was the formal recitation from me

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"How can I quit what I'm doing?" I would shout. "Tell
me how dammit, tell me." I had to find it for myself.


The weeks faded into months, and we came together time
after time in a grindingly dull and dry repetition of all our
previous meetings. It was like a stylized dance of the puppets
or the ten-thousandth recitation of a poem--same dialogue,
same response, same feelings, same outcome.


My frustration grew and I'm sure that Carl's did too. I
knew I simply wasn't doing anything. I wasn't getting anywhere.
I knew it, but I didn't know why. Finally my own
intense feelings of inertia and failure got to be more overwhelming
than my need to keep things the same.


On that day I approached our session with feelings of
anxiety and agitation. I knew I had to do something, but I
didn't know what. I felt deeply that I had to do something
to get myself moving, to quit repeating the failure of our
relationship over and over.


At last the door opened. Carl stuck his head out and
smiled, "Come in."


We sat there awhile, with me saying nothing and him
replying with an alert but gentle silence. The minutes
dragged by. More silence. My anxiety grew. I was almost
literally shaking.


"I'm afraid," I murmured. Carl replied, "I can see that."
"My hands are shaking" I held out one trembling hand for
him to see. He looked, but said nothing.


"Goddamn," I exploded. "Aren't you going to do or say
something?"

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a nondefensive tone he replied, "What is it you want
me to do or say?"


And then from my lips I was surprised to hear, "I want
you to hold my hand." I couldn't believe I had said it! A
thirty-five-year-old man asking another man to hold his
hand, like a child or a homosexual. I decided that it was a
child who said that.


"All right," Carl replied. He moved his chair nearer mine
and took my hand in his. My anxiety grew to unbearable
limits and after a few seconds I had to release my clasp and
take my hand back. But it was a first for me. I had surrendered
my anonymous objectivity, and I had permitted a
relationship to develop which depended on the gratification
of my primary needs to sustain it.


"I wondered how long it would take you to do something
like that," Carl smiled. "I almost gave up the hope that you
ever could."


"I really didn't know what you meant when you talked
about resisting you and maintaining distance until now. I
didn't know what you were talking about when you said
I had to give up to win. Finally, I understand," I said. And
I did. I guess Professor Freud must have known something
after all!


<b>Hurting</b>


These moments reduced the sharp edge of my torment.
But it wasn't enough. I was still hurting, still hoping, still
tormented. Emotional pain is real. It pierces and penetrates
the secret, hidden places in your body and soul. It grinds,
thrusts, wrenches, and rips into the fiber of your being.


It is pain. Pain of a kind and degree that is difficult to
describe to you. I have felt many times as if all the demons
of hell were tearing at my mind and body. It has hurt so

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The shut-down part of that person's mind probably
decays or atrophies from isolation and disuse. After an indeterminate
period of time (governed by what forces we
don't know), a few years, or sometimes only a few weeks,
this part of the mind is the sole province of the "demons"
and their isolation in a divided mind serves to reduce the
pain they cause. But by their isolation, they become firmly
entrenched and likely can never be displaced.


Then there are a sizeable number of those, myself included,
who apparently are unable to give up part of their minds
in exchange for a lessening of pain. If I could make the swap,
I probably would. But they and I are forced to struggle on
and on. Sometimes I get a glimpse of what it means emotionally
to be "free." What a wonderful, magnificent feeling.
Not only is the pain gone, but you feel able to cope with
things, to give of yourself, to be interested and concerned
about others, to look at the world and see promise rather
than despair. Too bad, but those moments are far too few.
Most of the time, you are engrossed in an inner battle for

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The pounding sick headache, the spasmodic, cramping
gut, the debilitating diarrhea, dizziness, clumsiness, tics,
and paralyzed muscles. These are only a small sample of the
attacks that can be mounted on the body front alone.


The real versatility of your opponent is shown in the
confrontation with your emotions and your intellect. The
range of pathology possible in these human spheres is almost
indescribable and the signs and symptoms uncountable.
But some bright people try to describe them and to
count them. And they probably do a respectable job. But
they omit the essence of the pain in their description. They
may say, for instance, "Delusions are common in this syndrome."
They should say, "Delusions are common in this
syndrome, resulting from the sufferer's attempts to make
some sense out of the exquisite agony he is experiencing."


Man is compelled by his very nature, which is still the
human condition, no matter how deranged, to try in every
way possible to make his experience logical. So his mind
invents a "cover story" which explains the events he is
experiencing. You have to do something when your body,
your feelings, and your judgment are in utter chaos and
turmoil. You cannot sit on the sidelines and observe. You do
what you can because you must do something.


<b>The ways out</b>


Then one struggles over the years. Days and weeks and
even months become too small to count as units of time.
You see some rays of light, but you feel far too many stabs

[p. <i>77</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sometimes you can't bring yourself to seek comfort and
help and sometimes you haven't had a clear look at the
disturbed part of your mind. Then you may get drunk or
take drugs, beat your wife, spend all your money in a mad
frenzy, or wriggle about in other ways to escape the pain.
Of course, the most prevalent way to stop it is to extinguish
the host, to destroy one's body.


However, this method has one major disadvantage. It is
not reversible or correctable. Many people every day try it
anyhow. Suicide is currently the tenth leading cause of
death. For those who try it, the point and degree of suffering
have overbalanced the point and degree of comfort, and
they make the choice that ceasing to live is preferable to
living in pain. Many, many people who struggle with
symptoms of depression and anxiety reach the time when
they recognize only two choices--to live miserably or to die
quickly.

If there were a physical disease that manifested itself in
some particularly ugly way, such as pustulating sores or a
sloughing off of the flesh accompanied by pain of an intense
and chronic nature, readily visible to everyone, and if that
disease affected fifteen million people in our country, and
further, if there were virtually no help or succor for most of
these persons, and they were forced to walk among us in
their obvious agony, we would rise up as one social body
in sympathy and in anger. We would give of our resources,
both human and economic, and we would plead and demand
that this suffering be eased. There isn't such a physical
disease, but there is such a disease of the mind, and
about fifteen million people around us are suffering from it.
But we have not risen in anger and sympathy, although they
are walking among us and crying in their pain and anguish.


Their cry takes many forms. Some few kill their fellows.
Some abuse, emotionally and physically, those they love;
some write petitions of hate and wear costumes of evil;
some lay down their bodies and simply expire; others hasten
the process with a gun or knife; some cries take the form
of the drunk or the junkie or the pervert. These are the more
dramatic, demanding cries that society has to answer in
some fashion. However, most of the cries are far less dramatic
or interesting. They manifest themselves in the drawn
face, in a timid, hesitant manner. They show themselves as
poor work, as uncooperativeness, as quarreling or irritability.
On a broader social scale, these cries take the form of
civil disobedience, riots, and wars.


For the most part, the cries are unheeded. So one body
with its troubled mind refuses eternally to relate to the rest
of the world; another turns on the gas and waits impatiently
for release. Some wind up with their bodies humanely mutilated
by various surgeons. Still another seeks some comfort
from liquor or morphine or LSD. The occasional one kills or

<b>How long?</b>


I thought I would wait until it was all over. That seems
to be the customary thing when one is trying to write about
a tragedy or hardship. That sounds rather dramatic, doesn't
it? I guess it has to be dramatic. We usually struggle to live
when death seems to be the preferred alternative.


So I've waited for over six years, and it's not over yet. If
I'm going to write something that may mean something to
other people, I'd better begin. I must confess that I'm writing
these words with a "let me tell you about my operation"
attitude. I need to say some things, call it therapy if you
choose. Some of you who read these words are searching
just as desperately as I.


The trouble with writing about a disturbed, sick mind
and soul is that in general it is uninteresting and seldom
filled with action or uniqueness. Depression must be the
most undynamic and uninteresting phenomenon in the
world. Almost by definition, it suggests the abandonment
of interest. Some of you know this. I would like to tell
others, since depression is of critical concern to the person
who suffers it. It is my aim to try to tell you something
about the inner world of a person struggling with depression
and anxiety. When we make the plea that words can't
describe it, we are begging the question. We have to try with
words.

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My reading and experience in the world of the mentally
ill have left me with considerable frustration. For example,
a behavioral description of an acute depression may read
like this: "The patient may cry readily and at great length.
He may profess that he is worthless, of no utter use to the
world. He may believe that he has caused natural calamities,
such as floods and earthquakes. Chances are his sleep pattern
is erratic with early waking the rule. He may be unable
to eat at times, almost to the point of total fasting. Often
he complains of various bodily dysfunctions. Headaches,
nausea, abdominal pain, lower back discomfort, poor appetite,
and general malaise are the most frequent complaints."


The observant reader will note that this description says
not a word about the feelings of the sufferer. Most of them
don't. Little is said about the vicious, unrelenting pain, pain
so terrible and so inescapable that eventually the possibility
of ending the suffering by death is seriously considered.


I expect that suicide is of utmost concern to the whole
gamut of "mental health professionals." They are justified
in their contention that they can treat only the living. The
dead have abandoned any chance, however slim, of recovery.
But little apparent attention is given to why self-inflicted
death is so frequent in the various mental disorders.
This outcome is not a natural consequence of depression,
anxiety, or any other noxious emotion.


One only has to observe the feelings of someone who has
recently lost a loved one to see this. Freud postulated a death
wish. Others have suggested that man is endowed with "a
drive to destruction." Many social scientists extend this
theorizing to the broader social structure to explain war and
other civil discord. Such explanations are dogmatic in nature
and gratuitous in contribution. Which is to say that they
offer nothing to the understanding of human nature.


One explanation of this phenomenon is so simple, so free

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What determines which alternative the individual will
"select" in an attempt to escape something that he can no
longer bear? I'm not sure that he really has much choice in
the matter. It may well be that constitutional factors are
important. Apparently some people are born more constitutionally
able to tolerate pain than others.


Undoubtedly, lifestyle plays an important part. How has
the person escaped the nonpathologjcal pain in the past?
Has he used aggressive physical or verbal action, resorted to
fantasy and daydreaming, shifted the burden to someone
else, and on and on through the almost unlimited repertoire
of human behavior. The mechanism that is finally resorted
to is probably a culmination and a combination of heredity,
lifestyle, present circumstances, and self-determination.
Self-determination, you say? Yes. Ultimately, even the person
who kills himself physically must choose his weapon.
So we do have some measure of choice. And it is to this even
so slight indication of man's "freedom" that I look for hope.


<b>Hope</b>


The hope that we look for is the hope generated by acceptance
and empathy. The hope that is reflected in the response

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Think about the response you might make if your best
friend came to you and said he was afraid his boss was
displeased with him and he might lose his job. What would
be your first comments? If you're like most of us, you would
offer reassurance. "Look, he gave you a raise last year; he
wouldn't do that if he thought your work was unsatisfactory.
Besides, he's never told you that you weren't doing
well." Your friend sighs; he can see that you didn't hear the
message he gave you: "I'm afraid."


At another level, we might even tell him, "Don't worry,
things will work out" or "Half the things you worry about
never come true." Perhaps we really turn him off by offering
advice. "You should work harder. Put in some overtime;
that'll really impress him."


How much better and how much more helpful we could
be to each other if we could respond to the emotional message
of pleas for help. Why can't we say to our friend, "I
can see you are really worried; tell me about it." Think what
this kind of response can lead to for him. He can explore his
worry. He can verbalize it and put it in perspective. He can
listen to himself and see how it really sounds when described
to someone else. He is freed to think about himself
and his feelings openly rather than defending his beliefs
and ideas to a skeptical listener. Why don't we answer cries
for help this way? Why do we persist in questioning, probing,
denying, rationalizing, and reassuring? Probably because

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Yet, it's a paradox that open exploration of fear, frustration,
and anxiety serves to reduce those feelings. Denial and
unrealistic reassurance serve to increase them. These intensified,
unrelieved, and unexpressed feelings drain our energy
and sap our emotional resources. They corrupt our pleasure
in living and our joy in others. They bind us to a rigid,
unfulfilling, and unproductive way of using ourselves and
of relating to others.


In the pages that follow, I'll try to describe my own struggles
to contain and overcome my fears and frustrations, my
hostile rages and unrequited needs. I'm not unique in experiencing
these emotions. All of us are subject to their
influences in our lives. My great psychological mistake was
that I denied my feelings as long as I could, and I finally
refused to share them with others when I could no longer
deny them.


My attempts to put myself back together after my collapse
were not always successful. Like the proverbial "sinner,"
I was subject to frequent backsliding. I think, though,
that I learned something each time I pulled myself through
another self-induced crisis. This kind of experience and this
kind of learning contributed a great deal to my subsequent
development as a psychologist, even if it taught me nothing
more than to be sensitive to how I had failed a client.


It must be human nature. Whatever that is! So many of
us operate our lives with the apparent conviction that "if I
don't talk about it, it won't happen," or "if I don't think
about it, it won't be true." That's how I behaved, and sometimes
still do. And that's how many unhappy people
manipulate their own lives and the lives of those they have
in their care and keeping.


After I had experienced my own psychic disintegration,

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sue was withdrawn and sullen, and, at five years of age,
she had no friends, and she had no fun. In her history was
a long series of hospitalizations for ear and throat infections.
She continued to have a chronic ear problem which was
going to require more medical treatment.


"Was Sue very upset over her trips to the hospital and the
operations?" I asked her mother. "Oh, no," her mother replied
proudly, "she never cried or complained one time. In
fact, she never cries."


I thought to myself, "I'll bet she didn't! You just didn't
hear her."


In play sessions with Sue, after we got to know each
other, I brought in a toy table, a bed, and doll figures of a
man, a woman, and a child. I put the child doll in the bed
and put the woman beside the bed.


"The baby's sick," I said to Sue, "and here's mamma.
What happens now?"


At first Sue wouldn't play at all. "I don't know," she
insisted stubbornly. "Well," I said, "we've got to do something;
the baby's sick." I waited longer than Sue could
stand. Finally she spoke for the mother doll, "Come on,
we've got to go to the doctor and get some medicine."


I inquired, "What does the baby say?"


"Nothing," Sue replied stubbornly.


With that, she picked up the baby and the mother and
"took" them to the doctor.

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Let me tell a story now. Sue." I took the baby doll and
put her back in the bed with the mother alongside.


Now I spoke for the dolls. "Baby, your ears are infected
again. We're going to have to go to the doctor and get some
medicine." Baby replied, "But, I'm afraid. It'll hurt me."


I looked at Sue, who was absorbedly following the action.
"What does mamma say now, Sue?" I asked. Almost automatically
she replied, "You're a big girl now. Big girls
don't cry. The doctor won't hurt you."


We paused for a moment, still looking at the dolls and
thinking about what was happening. I spoke for the baby,
"I'm afraid. He'll hurt me. I'm gonna cry." I sobbed a few
times for the baby. Then I picked her up and gave her to the
mamma. Then the mamma said, "I know you're afraid, and
I'll be with you all the time, and if it hurts, I'll hold your
hand, and I won't let go."


Sue sat quietly watching. Two big tears filled her eyes and
ran down her cheeks. Her mother said she never cried.
