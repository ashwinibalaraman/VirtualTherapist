ON A FRIDAY MORNING in November, 1946, my
first psychic experience occurred in the basement
laundry room of a New York apartment house. I
had gone down with the week&apos;s accumulation of
dirty clothes, sorted things out, and plunged the
first load into clean, soapy water.


There could scarcely be a more appropriate
place in which to leave one world and enter another.
Actually and figuratively I had reached the
low point of my life. A thoughtless period had
shed forever, and I was soon to enter bewildering

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My experience came when I was thirty-eight
years of age. Not until 1960 when I was fifty-two
did I find my way out of the depths, and achieve
a firm adjustment to the unsuspected complexities
I had discovered in my once narrow world.


I have no dramatic personal history to relate
up to that strange day in the cellar. I was born in
1908 in Toledo, Ohio, and raised by a loving
mother and loving grandparents. My parents
were divorced when I was only a few months old.
My schooling took me through high school in
Colorado. From Colorado, my mother and I went
to Minneapolis where I did simple commercial
art work during the day and studied ballet three
evenings a week.


Those hours of dancing were joyous ones for
me and were in happy contrast with the routine
tasks of the day and the quiet evenings I otherwise
spent with my mother. As is only natural, I
became excited over the possibility of going on
the stage. Within a year an opportunity came
through my school to join a ballet group. I was
nineteen at the time, and for the next two and a
half years I remained with the group and toured
the larger cities of America.


One might think that this would have made me
sophisticated, but it didn&apos;t. I was by nature unworldly,

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

With my mother I settled down to a less lucrative
but more certain life and devoted myself to
secretarial work.


Before long, the natural dream of every woman
came true for me. I fell in love. This love led to
marriage when I was twenty-five. In time I gave
birth to two daughters, and lived comfortably in
better-than-average financial circumstances.


In 1946, when the first period of my life ended
and the second phase began, I was thirty-eight
years old and had been married for twelve years.


Life doesn&apos;t change for most people. Why did
the experience I am about to relate happen to me?


My trouble, perhaps, was that I had remained
too long on a naive level. After all, I believe it is
rather unusual for a woman to reach the age of
thirty-eight before she begins to mature intellectually
and to gain some realistic understanding of
herself and others.


That I had failed myself was the number one
reason. Yet, there may have been secondary
causes which occupied my consciousness and
combined to distract me from the necessity of

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Were these lesser causes physiological? Were
they emotional? Were there any distressing family
relationships? How did I get along with my
husband? What kind of a marriage did we have
after twelve years?


In a way there were physiological reasons. I
was often tired but attributed my fatigue to an
abundance of tasks, most of which were self-imposed.
A cleaning woman came once a week. I
did the rest: shopping, cooking, washing, ironing,
mending. In addition to the household tasks, I
was the secretary-bookkeeper for my husband&apos;s
business and spent a part of each day at his office.
To this already crowded schedule, I added a fair
amount of social activity and squeezed in a
hobby or two. Like most women, I enjoyed the
constant distraction and busyness of my days.


As far as family relationships were concerned,
our two daughters, aged seven and eleven, represented
no problems. However, my mother was a
part of our home and even though she lived in
another apartment her interests were confined to
our family. She was gentle, reserved, sensitive
and considerate in every way. Yet her confidence
and trust in me were overwhelming. Her dependence
became exhausting at times.

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the other hand, my husband, from whom I
would have welcomed some signs of dependence
appeared to be thoroughly self-sufficient and self-confident.
He was a professional man and constantly
occupied with his own thoughts and
ambitions.


I&apos;m afraid that when I married I had expected
my husband to fulfill life for me completely. I
had felt at the beginning that my new estate
would be more than sufficient to keep me busy
and content. Like many women in love, I tried
hard to <i>be</i> what I thought my husband wished.
This solicitous behavior, however, eventually left
me without a will or wish of my own and tended
to bore my husband. Actually, I suppose I was
leaning on my husband in much the same manner
that my mother was leaning on to me. Neither
mother nor I meant to be burdensome, but we
were unconsciously expecting our entire happiness
to come from another. My dependence on
my husband became something of a burden to
him. He advised me many times, and not unkindly,
"Quit leaning on me and create interests
of your own."


I truly admired my husband and took seriously
every criticism he made of me. In order to please
him and to break what he considered my hanging
on, I made continuous efforts during our married

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But to little avail. None of my interests could
absorb me as completely as I wished. Constantly
before me was an example of capacity for hard
work and self-discipline to which I very much
aspired.


The one masculine talent I most admired and
envied in my husband was his ability to concentrate.
No family argument, no deluge of tears on
my part interfered with this accomplishment.
Regardless of what happened in his private or
professional life, he could retire to his study and
lose himself in his work.


I longed for a way of life that would absorb me
as completely, capture my entire attention, make
me unaware of or at least immune to the trials of
everyday life.


No matter how hard I tried I couldn&apos;t seem to
come within sight of my goal.


Although my husband&apos;s interests kept him
somewhat aloof and preoccupied, he was a very
fine man, and I knew that as marriages went we
had an exceptionally good one. I had been surprised
and somewhat chagrined that the magic
quality in love had not proved to be permanent.
However, my love affair had been all I had hoped

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

No doubt my strongest desire was to keep life
harmonious, gracious, and as peaceful and perfect
as possible. Furthermore, I always felt that it
should be within my power to make it so for all
members of my family. If life failed to sail upon a
calm sea, the failure was mine personally.


All these were simple, human problems and
aspirations shared by most everyone. Why were
they too much for me? Why did a crisis strike
me? Perhaps I&apos;ll never know....


By the summer of 1946, I was weary and discouraged.
The zest was oozing out of my life. My
hobbies seemed meaningless. The future promised
but a repetition of the past--there were no
new, fresh experiences of any importance to anticipate.
What if I should travel more, own a fine
home, buy more expensive clothes? There was
nothing unusual or different in this ... just more
of the same thing.


Life had become static. Yet, a nagging thought
was often with me. I sensed there was something
I ought to be doing--but what? I often had a
guilty feeling that somehow I was failing my
children. I really had nothing to give them, nothing
to teach them in which I truly believed or

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I kept these anxieties to myself as I mechanically
fulfilled my ordinary duties and responsibilities.


I had reached a low ebb in August 1946, when
something stimulating and meaningful came to
me from the pages of a book. My intellectual
curiosity was awakened and quickened for the
first time. With a thrill I sensed that I might find
what I sought in books--absorbing and profound
ideas, congenial personalities, understanding,
even truths. Albert J. Nock&apos;s, <i>Memoirs of a
Superfluous Man</i>, started me on a long personal
search to find the best that had been thought and
said by others.


The <i>Memoirs</i>, primarily a "literary and philosophical
autobiography," opened many doors.
Nock&apos;s rigorous classical education, coupled with
a long career as biographer, essayist and editor of
the <i>Freeman</i>, gave him unusual insight into the
blunders and foibles of the first forty years of the
twentieth century. These he did not criticize in
harsh terms but accepted as inevitable. In return
he offered earthy, commonsense observations in a
most original and amusing manner.


While Nock commented cleverly on politics,
economics, religion, women, art, food, and the
like, his remarks on education affected me most,

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a spirit of adventure I began my quest for
something I could believe in, something approaching
truth. My only clue to a truth at that
time was Nock&apos;s statement that the ideas of
Henry George had never been refuted. On this
recommendation I purchased George&apos;s <i>Progress
and Poverty</i> and in the fall of 1946 joined a study
group devoted to his economic philosophy.


A new world now opened for me and I rushed
joyously and recklessly into it. Little did I expect
that my search would lead me to the anguish of
an awesome experience.


Before long my exciting intellectual searchings
and gropings--added to all my other activities--
proved too much for my powers. At the approach
of winter, a heavy weariness settled over me and
with it came increasing sensations of emptiness,
uneasiness and depression. I feared that I did not
have the strength or the capacity to enter the
world I had glimpsed in Nock&apos;s <i>Memoirs</i>. I grew
discouraged, feeling that an engrossing interest
had come too late.


True to my nature, I so successfully concealed
outward signs of fatigue, tension and disappointment
that no one noticed all was not well. I kept
going as usual, growing more weary with each

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On a day in November my husband left on a
business trip and a few hours later my watch
stopped.


I date the beginning of my strange adventure
from the moment my watch stopped. This happening
was of utmost importance because it precisely
marked the moment I became aware that
<i>time</i> had changed for me.


My watch stopped while I was dressing for a
luncheon engagement. On impulse I decided to
leave it unwound on my dressing table and to pay
no attention to anything that told time.


Upon leaving the apartment I walked to the
bus stop, got on the proper bus, and rode to
Greenwich Village.


When I left the bus, I walked the few blocks to
my friend&apos;s apartment building, climbed three
flights of stairs, rang the doorbell and arrived at
the exact time for which I had been invited.


The incident impressed me. Without having
glanced at a clock or watch, I had kept right on
schedule--and in a relaxed and leisurely manner
to which I had been quite unaccustomed.


I decided not to wear a watch or glance at a
clock or hurry ever again. With relief I sensed
that I had all the <i>time</i> there was, and a new, quiet
harmony enveloped me as I innocently surrendered

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My husband&apos;s absence gave me an opportunity
to continue on my new course without benefit of
watches or clocks. It mattered little if I arrived at
the office on exact schedule or if the dinner hour
came early or late. For the most part, I was alone
and entirely free to drift with each mood and to
delight in new sensations. Surprise followed surprise.


When first I felt the bliss of patience, I recall
being astonished at the deep pleasure the experience
gave me. Who would ever think to desire
patience, even though patience might well be the
most important quality one could have? I was
grateful for this unexpected gift and thought that
never again need I be irritated with anybody.


Patience came and fear left.


Though timid by nature, all fear now disappeared.
I took to walking down dark and dismal
streets and was thrilled to be without the slightest
apprehension.


The streets did not stay dark for long, however,
for all things in sight began to glow brighter.
Even the smallest lights twinkled with a wonderful
brilliance. The appearance of those who
passed by also underwent changes. Their bodies
seemed to dwindle away while their heads took

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Meanwhile my senses of smell and taste were
growing so keen that the most commonplace food
and drink seemed like ambrosia.


I now know that such symptoms are by no
means unusual during states of consciousness that
have become altered or intensified. There can be
a seeming change in time, a sharpening of the
senses, a need for utmost cleanliness, a peace that
passes all understanding, an assurance that all
will be well. Sometimes elation and ecstasy come,
and often there is a surge of energy.


Energy flowed into me until it completely cancelled
all my former fatigue and weariness. To
my delight I was able to put in a long, hard day&apos;s
work, sleep a few hours, and then wake refreshed.
Or so it seemed.


All in all I was in an emotionally intensified
state for perhaps seven days. The first days were
wondrously happy, then little by little exhilaration
gave way to consternation until eventually I
was living in a nightmare of fear and apprehension.


By the fourth day I was spending long hours of
wakefulness in a frantic search to discover what
was happening to me. I sensed with alarm that
time was shortening. I was going somewhere. I

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went up to mother&apos;s apartment and with an
effort to be casual mentioned that I was becoming
interested in spiritual matters. Would she
suggest a book for me to start with as a novice?


My mother had long been engrossed in religious
and mystical writings. Although I knew
next to nothing about such things, I felt a strong
resistance, if not an actual repugnance, toward
her interest. While she could not completely conceal
the fact that she was surprised and excited
by my sudden about-face, she was too wise to
question me. The book she selected and silently
handed me was Ouspensky&apos;s <i>A New Model of the
Universe</i>.


That night I opened the book. To my dismay it
contained 476 pages of small print and narrow
margins--I had not the time for so long a book.
Hurriedly I turned the pages, reading a sentence
here, a paragraph there, and all the while another
miracle was happening. Without having had the
slightest previous acquaintance with such erudition,
I could understand Ouspensky&apos;s meaning.
My mind was opening. Whatever I read made
sense.


Everything that Ouspensky wrote was new to
me. It was like hidden knowledge revealed,
buried treasure uncovered. How marvelous that

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

How I wished I could linger over such a book,
but time was shortening at a frightening rate. I
felt myself propelled along the shortest possible
route to an unknown destination.


The next morning I opened the Bible. Here
again the miracle of understanding repeated itself.
No matter what paragraph I read, concealed
meanings were revealed to me. That which was
secret was disclosed. Could it be that everything
that needed to be known had been hidden in the
Bible for those who could understand, who had
"eyes to see" and "ears to hear"? Familiar phrases
from Sunday School days of long ago came back
to memory.


Then the unnerving realization came that no
book was necessary. Everything written could be
locked away forever or destroyed. All truth was
in the soul and understanding of man, each and
every man....


It was Thursday, November 21, 1946, when my
husband returned from his trip. The moment I
saw him I knew that an immeasurable distance
had come between us during his short absence.
We were in different worlds, though we sat in the
same room.


How could this have happened? What awful

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Never for a single instant had I considered that
I might have to give up my husband! Such a
thought could not have entered my head. In fact,
I had anticipated the joy of telling him of the
miraculous new world I had been discovering.
But then the peaceful world had turned sinister; I
didn&apos;t dare tell him anything. He would think I
was ill, that I was suffering delusions.


I experienced a dreadful helplessness. My husband
dictated a number of letters. He seemed to
speak incredibly slowly and haltingly. Indeed,
several minutes seemed to elapse between each
word--a nerve wracking experience. The words
when finally uttered made no sense to me. Evidently
I took and transcribed the letters properly,
because I finished out the day and managed to
conceal my inner turmoil.


To repeat, the day was Thursday. The department
stores were open late. My husband and I
went shopping at Macy&apos;s, and then had dinner
before we returned home.


All this time I could scarcely hold back my
tears. In the space of a week the everyday world
of offices, department stores, restaurants had
grown impossibly remote. I had lost contact with

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The horror was that I couldn&apos;t tell my husband.
How could I explain that I was losing connection
with my accustomed life ... that I was moving
farther away ... picking up speed ... unable to
stop? How was it possible that all was changing
inwardly while my outward appearance and behavior
remained unaltered? As far as I can recall
my husband didn&apos;t notice anything unusual about
me or, if he did, he kept his feelings to himself.


There was little sleep for me that night. Finally
I rose and sat alone in the living room--smoking,
crying at long last, and wondering if there was
<i>anything</i> I could do to reverse the forces that
were carrying me away. I was no longer tempted
to search for an answer in books. The last thing I
wanted was another moment of illumination.
More than anything else I feared that a revelation
might break through and that it would be more
than I could endure.


I decided to wind my watch. This was the only
action I could think of that might start me on my
way back and restore my connections. I sat there
crying and worrying in a state of nervous exhaustion.


When morning came, I prepared breakfast.
The girls left for school as usual, my husband

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I was gathering the laundry, my mother
came in. In a burst of confidence I quickly told
her that I had gone on a spiritual journey and
must get back, that she must help me. Then I
took both her hands in mine. I can still remember
holding them tightly with a desperate hope that
her firm clasp might be able to keep me in this
world.


Mother was distraught and attempted to dissuade
me from doing the laundry. However, I
managed to reassure her that I was quite all
right, and I went to the basement alone.


The basement was empty. I had all the equipment
to myself: gas dryers, stationary tubs, and
the one wringer-type washing machine. I filled
the tub while sorting the clothes and started the
first load. Then I placed my watch on a table,
noting the time and intending to let the machine
run for at least five minutes.


I waited and watched the timepiece--hours it
seemed. The clothes in the washing machine continued
to slosh but the hands of the watch would
not move.... <i>Time was standing still</i>....


There is a difference between time standing
still and a clock that has stopped. There is no
mistaking it. The ticking goes on but the hands of

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I remember a flash of starry sky, a sky so close I
could have stretched out my hand and touched a
planet.


I saw no more, but quailed under a sudden onslaught
of religious thoughts.


Was this the start of the <i>millennium?</i> The kind
of millennium I had heard about as a child?


Something to inspire awe and misgivings?


Were the thousand years of peace about to
begin?


Perhaps there wasn&apos;t just one big judgment day
for the whole of creation, but millions of little
judgment days--one for every soul--taking place
continuously! Perhaps each soul lived out its own
span of years, had its private judgment day--and
its own millennium.


Then for one awful instant, thought and consciousness
seemed to separate from my body. Although
I saw nothing in this dreary, gray basement,
I sensed that I had looked upon the face of
God and must die. I knew I had blundered into
something mysterious and holy for which I was
unprepared and unworthy and thus had committed
a terrible and unforgivable sin. I could
scarcely breathe and stood for a moment gasping,
uncertain as to whether I was dead or alive.

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Terrified and still gasping for air, I came out of
my shock, rushed into the hall and rang for the
elevator. An astonished operator took me back to
the first floor.


In the apartment, I flopped onto the bed and
cried out to my mother to run for the doctor
whose office was across the street. She hastened
away and shortly returned leading the doctor.


I was trembling with fright and excitement. As
he stared anxiously at me, I sobbed over and over
that I had had a spiritual revelation and would
have to die.


He gave me a sedative. To a small degree it
relieved my spent nerves.


For a few moments I felt such sweetness and
goodness surrounding me that I would not have
been surprised had the walls crumbled away to
disclose a heavenly host marching forward to
help me. This sensation of blissful companionship
was but a fleeting one. From then on I was left
completely to myself, bewildered and utterly exhausted.
I thought I should never be able to get
out of bed again.


When my husband was notified, he hurried
home, bringing a gift of twelve red roses.


Later he told me that the doctor had telephoned
and stated that I had undergone a breakdown
centering around a religious experience.

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Because this made no apparent sense to my husband,
he had questioned the doctor about the
identity of the patient. Had the right husband
been connected with the right wife? No wonder
he had been incredulous! During our twelve
years of marriage I had never shown the slightest
inclination toward spiritual matters.


During the next three days I underwent painful
tensions. Each time these tensions would build up
to a point where I could bear them no more.
Then they would subside for a brief, peaceful
lull. Each time I hoped that I might be through
with my ordeal. But no--an hour or hours later
another attack would occur.


Disturbing questions caused my suffering. A
problem would overcome me and nervous anxiety
would mount as I strained to find a proper
solution. Each time a satisfactory answer came to
me, the tensions would ease for a while.


My problems finally narrowed down to a few
which returned time and again to obsess me: how
could I make my husband understand that august
and mighty forces were at work in the universe
from which there was no escape? These forces
could seize and terrify a person, or they could
cast a magic glow over the world which seemed
to promise peace and beauty forever. I wanted to
lead my husband into the wonder of it all. But

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697840-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At a time like this when all seemed lost, futile,
insoluble, one would expect any test of the limits
of human endurance to be drastic and mighty. To
forfeit life itself seemed the only atonement equal
to my sin. Would I be asked to give my life? I
didn&apos;t want to die, but had no choice in the matter
of life or death.


Or <i>did</i> I have a choice after all? Was I obliged
to take matters into my own hands and put an
end to myself? What good could possibly come
from making my children motherless?


Thus I reasoned until I finally reached one conclusion:
I would accept my fate or whatever was
in store for me, but I would never take a fatal
step of my own accord.


Then came a simple, little question, which at a
time of great stress might be considered amusing.
It struck me by surprise for its naïvete.


I was lying in bed thinking of the many mental
avowals I had made, how I would go so far as to
sacrifice my everlasting life for the good of humanity,
when another voice seemed to whisper:
"If your intentions are so marvelous, would you
be willing to make a small actual sacrifice? For
instance, give up smoking?"

The question showed so ingenious a knowledge
of my weakness that I burst into tears. I had
smoked at least a package of cigarettes a day for
the past fifteen years. Now I was trying to cut
down to one cigarette an hour. I had been watching
the clock as I lay in bed musing and waiting
for another hour to end. The time was 11:40 A.M.,
Monday, November 25, 1946. Twenty minutes
remained before my next cigarette.


With dismay I realized that I had been slyly
tricked. Though the sacrifice might be small, the
last thing I wanted to do was to give up smoking.
Yet there seemed to be no other way out. How
else could I free myself and at the same time keep
my integrity and good intentions intact? With a
sigh of resignation I took the only course open to
me and gave up smoking.


This definite action promptly brought relief. It
put an end to the first phase of a long ordeal, and
opened a door to further trials.
