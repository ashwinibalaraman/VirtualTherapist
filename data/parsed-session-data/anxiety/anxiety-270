This hospital was, most of the time, a place of monotony.
Because of this there seemed to be a tension induced
within the patients; their routine afforded no real release for the
turbulent anxieties within them. It was a relief when something
out-of-the-way happened.


So it was that the birth and development of the "twins"
brought an excitement to the patients to which they responded
with inner satisfaction, even though, at the same time, they bewailed
the encroachment of these sick "twins" upon them.


This is the way the "twins" were born. First there came to
the hospital one night a sixteen-year-old boy almost completely
paralyzed—in hysteria. It was just after supper and most of us
were drifting into the recreation room. They'd brought him
inside the ward while we were eating and had put him to bed,
but now, all of a sudden, he was out of bed and standing in the
middle of the recreation room.


"My God," said Mr. Minnick, "what's that kid doing in
here?"


The boy's anguished eyes peered out from a thin, frozen-looking
white face, stiff-necked atop a sharp-boned boy's body
encased in hospital pajamas and bathrobe.


The boy's left arm dangled loosely from the shoulders. The
right arm was bent rigid at the elbow and the palm was upturned
stiffly at chest level and thrust outward in a paralyzed
begging sort of gesture.


"Enoch!" It was the nurse, Mrs. Robinson. Her tone softened.

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Enoch didn't move. Mrs. Robinson went over and put her
arm around his shoulders. "Enoch, do you want to meet the
others here? They're your friends. Don't be frightened of
them."


She introduced us to him but still he didn't move or speak.
Mrs. Robinson kept her arm around him. "There's nothing to
fear here, Enoch. You'll be resting here for just a little and
then you'll go home again."


At the word "home," a trickle of tears started down his thin,
blank face.


Mrs. Robinson looked from him to us. "Enoch has been
frightened recently. Something happened. He had a shock.
But we'll all treat him well, and help him with things, for a
little, and pretty soon he'll be able to take care of himself."


He could walk, in a stiff-legged, inching, shuffling way. But
he couldn't talk, nor smile, nor move his up-raised right palm,
nor lift his dangling left arm. He had to be fed and clothed.
When he went to the toilet, someone had to brace him on the
stool, lest he fall off.


This paralysis lasted five or six days; then slowly Enoch
began to move freely and he started talking. His talk didn't
make complete sense, but he thought it did and he talked as if
all of a sudden his throat had been uncorked. You couldn't get
him to stop.


He told a story about how he'd been out plowing in the field
and something, he didn't remember just what, had happened
and he'd stiffened up and his Uncle Virgil and his Brother Orville
had brought him up here. But now he was all right again
and he expected they'd be up right away to get him now that
he was feeling good again and the doctors here (he'd roll his
eyes in awe at this point at the thought) had sure better not give
his Uncle Virgil or, for that matter, his Brother Orville, any
trouble because, boy, they were both tough, and if the doctors

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Neither his Uncle Virgil nor his Brother Orville ever came
to see Enoch. But one day his father did, a little, sun-shriveled,
solemn-faced farmer with a deep-lined, leather-brown face.
Enoch's father, so Enoch told us later, wanted to take him home
now that he was "straightened out," wanted him at home to help
put the crops in. But I guess the doctors convinced Enoch's
father his boy wasn't ready to come home just yet. The father
left by himself.


After that, Enoch talked in his braggy boy's way about how
they needed him on the farm and how he expected, any day
now, tomorrow for sure, they'd just have to be sending him on
back, and if they didn't send him back he was just going to take
things into his own hands and break right out of this fool place
he was in where he wasn't doing anybody a bit of good and just
hitch a ride on back to the farm....


He talked so incessantly and his story was always so much
on the same theme that the other patients began to ignore him.
It wasn't that we made fun of him or were consciously cruel to
him in any way. It was just that we couldn't stand to hear him
talk all the time. It reached a point where he'd come around
and try to start a conversation and some of the patients would
leave and others would tell him to go away and quit bothering
them all the time.


So, after he'd been in the hospital about a month, he withdrew
into himself. A long part of each day he'd look out
through the heavy screen of the window in his room. He didn't
seem to bear anybody a grudge for his role of a misfit among
misfits. He was a basically good-humored and happy boy.
When the time for organized games came and the other patients
more or less <i>had</i> to associate with him, at such things as volley
ball or softball or occupational therapy sessions, he pitched in for
all he was worth, seemingly grateful for his chance to be "one of
the boys." But still it was obvious he was lonely, in need of

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mr. Schurr was about twenty-eight or nine. His squat, thick-muscled
body and his corded neck were, it seemed, designed
solely to support the weight of his great, big-boned head. His
hairline came down near his eyebrows and his eyes were brown
pin points.


His first night at the hospital Mr. Schurr asked me into his
room for a talk. His tiny eyes reflected burning fires of animal
anger and hooded shiftings of animal cunning as he talked. His
face was popping with great, glistening dewdrops of sweat.


"I've been doped, understand?" said Mr. Schurr. He narrowed
his eyes to points of invisibility. "Listen, I'm going to
tell you something that somebody ought to know. But unless I
say it's all right, until I do, you can't breathe a word of this to
anybody! Do you understand me?"


"Yes."


"Well, if you break your promise—" he raised a thick arm
and clenched a fist—"you'll be sorry! Anybody who double-crosses
Ralph Schurr is going to be sorry. They tricked me into
coming here and when I get out—" a fierce grimace—"there's
a guy who used to be a friend, I'm going to pay him back even
if I have to put a knife in his back. And I will, too!"


He looked at me as if it were important that I realize that he
was a man of his word.


"Didn't you ask to come in here?"


"Hell, no! They tricked me into it." The sweat poured down
from the broad, thick-boned face. "And just as soon as this
Mickey Finn this guy, this friend of mine, slipped me wears off,
I'm getting out! And when I do—" his voice spit through
clenched lips—"he's going to be sorry!"


Without conviction I spoke the first words that came to my
mind, words Frank Nesbit had first spoken to me. "This isn't
such a bad place. And they treat you all right here, too."

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mr. Schurr placed a burly arm heavily on my shoulder and
leaned toward me. "I don't have anything against this place.
It's O.K., I guess. As long as people treat me square, I'll do the
same for them. It's just that I don't want anybody double-crossing
me like that friend of mine did! This place might be just
fine but you see, soon as my head clears, I've got to get on home
to my job."


"What do you do?"


"I'm a telephone repair man."


"Do you have a family?"


"Yes, wife and five kids," Mr. Schurr said. "That's why I
can't stay here no matter how nice the place is."


"Well, you'll be getting out just as soon as the doctors say
you're ready."


"Listen! I know there's something wrong with me now. But
soon as <i>I</i> think I'm ready, just as soon as that damn dope wears
off, I'm leaving!" His shirt was dark with sweat.


"Well, good luck to you, Mr. Schurr. I'll be seeing you."


"Sure." A friendly smile now. "Say, what'd you say your
name was?"


"Bob Dahl."


"Bob Dahl? Well now, Bob, you look like I seen you some
place before. You don't work at the phone company?"


"No."


"I <i>know</i> I've seen you some place before. Where you from?"


"I've been living here in town the last few years. I came from
Missouri."


"Well, soon as I shake off this dope, I'll place you. Say!"
A smile of friendship mixed with a touch of cunning as he was
hit by an inner light of recognition. "Bob, you've been kidding
me. Dahl isn't your <i>real</i> name, is it?"


"Yes, it is."


"Don't try to fool me, Bob. I know your name. It's Bob, all
right. Bob Bigger, I know you!"


"Mr. Schurr, you've got me mixed up with someone else.
You really have. Good night now, I'll see you in the morning."

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Bob Bigger. You always were a ladder. Good night,
Bob...."


During the next several days, Mr. Schurr seemed to make a
plea for friendship among the other patients, much as he had
made with me. He went to Mr. Blum, Mr. Magnusson, Mr. Larsen,
Mr. Minnick and the others, and after a little talk he would
come to the question—with him a friendly challenge—of their
<i>real</i> last names.


With some of them he didn't change the name at all. It was:
"Mr. Blum, <i>of course!</i> I have an uncle named Blum. I'd recognize
you for his son any place! You say you don't know me.
But I know you, Mr. Blum! You're my cousin!"


And Mr. Blum would say, "Why, I'm old enough to be your
father."


But that wouldn't stop the triumphant Mr. Schurr, who apparently
felt that he could prove relationship with all the world
through some mystic powers of observation on his part.


"Mr. Blum, of course you're older than I am. My uncle
named Blum, he was brother to my grandfather! We're second
cousins, don't you see?"


But, of course, Mr. Blum couldn't see, nor could the others.
And as each of the other patients firmly denied relationship with
Mr. Schurr, he wilted. Until at last, puzzled because his
"own" relatives would not admit their kinship with him he, like
Enoch, became silent and withdrawn. Yet he was ready for
friendship, and when any of the patients would turn to him for
conversation, he responded with a desperately hopeful cheeriness.
But it was obvious to the other patients that Mr. Schurr
was at least as sick as Enoch and as with Enoch they avoided
Mr. Schurr.


Then it happened that Mr. Schurr began to talk at great length
to Enoch. And the "twins" were born....


One morning before breakfast, Enoch and Mr. Schurr burst
into the room shared by Mr. Blum, Mr. Larsen, Mr. Minnick
and me.


Mr. Blum was out, but the rest of us were busy making our

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Hey, fellows," came the triumphant cry. The burly man
who was Mr. Schurr burst into the room, arm around the boy
who was Enoch. "Listen, listen, listen to this!"


Mr. Minnick had had enough of both of these two.


"Listen to what?" he said in sour meditation upon the intricacies
of blanket folding.


"You won't believe this! But it's true! Enoch and me, we're
twins!"


Enoch grinned bashfully.


"Is that true, Enoch?" I asked. "Are you certain?"


Enoch nodded yes.


"Twins, ha!" said Mr. Minnick. "Two of a kind."


Mr. Schurr tried again. "We are! It's wonderful! Enoch's
people. They're all from Centerville. And my folks are, too!"


"Boy, oh, boy," said Mr. Minnick in disgust.


"Well, Enoch, you tell them," said Mr. Schurr proudly.
"Aren't we twins?"


"That's right," said Enoch, also with pride.


"You see, Mr. Minnick, Enoch, he came long after me. And
it was just luck we found out about it at all—our being twins.
Because the names, they're different. Enoch's name, it ain't
Schurr. But we are twins. Our grandmothers' names—" Mr.
Schurr smiled in friendly twinship at Enoch—"they are both
named Harris! Both from Centerville!"


"Oh, God, no," said Mr. Minnick, worrying over his bedspread.


"Laugh," said Mr. Schurr. "Laugh all you want! But our
grandfathers' names—Enoch, ain't this right?—is Schurr!" He
looked hard at Enoch.


"That's right," said Enoch. "My twin, he says it's so, it's so."


"How come, if all this is so, you're not brothers, instead of
twins?" I asked.

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"It comes back to us now," said Mr. Schurr. "We remember
we're twins. I'd guess we'd know, once we thought about it."


"My God," said Mr. Minnick, "there's more than ten years
between your ages!"


But Mr. Schurr, his arm tight around Enoch's shoulder, had
an answer for everything. "We're fraternal twins! That's why
the difference."


"Whadda ya mean, that's why the difference?" asked Mr.
Minnick.


Patiently Mr. Schurr explained. "I never went to college.
But I do know, just like you do, if you'd think on it, a fraternal
twin, he's a real twin, only born at a different time. He's a
brother, only more than a brother—a twin!"


"Good God," said Mr. Minnick.


"It's the truth," said Mr. Schurr. "Now look at us." Mr.
Schurr had his arm over Enoch's shoulder. Enoch smiled in
sweet security, his face almost hidden behind Mr. Schurr.
"Don't we <i>look</i> like twins?" said Mr. Schurr almost in a shout.


"Hell, no," said Mr. Minnick.


"Well, we are!" shouted Mr. Schurr, "We are! Ain't that
right, Enoch?"


"Yes!" said Enoch happily.


None of the patients nor the nurses nor the doctors could talk
them out of it. Enoch and Mr. Schurr ... they knew. They were
twins! They glowed with happiness at the thought that now they
belonged, one to the other, and so belonged in their close kinship
to the whole world which was the hospital.


In unfeigned disgust the other patients drew away from the
strange twosome. But in their ivory tower of kinship the opinion
of others no longer troubled them.


This lasted about a week or two, and then Enoch's father came
for him once more. This time the doctors let Enoch go home
with him.


Enoch didn't seem to me to be well enough to leave. So I
asked Dr. Andrews about him.

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Well now, Mr. Dahl, he's a lot better than when he came
here. He can talk and move. And his father does need him.
We've done all we can for him. You know there are people like
Enoch—their intelligence is so low you can only do so much."
Dr. Andrews smiled wryly.


"But he thinks Mr. Schurr is his twin," I said.


"When he gets home, he'll get over that. With him it has
been more a game of 'let's pretend' than perhaps it has been
with Mr. Schurr, I believe."


"What stiffened him up before he came here?"


"We're not sure," said Dr. Andrews. "He says his father was
beating him."


"Was he?"


"I don't think so. But anyhow we've done the best we can.
We think we've helped him about all we can. I doubt really that
his father was beating him."


"But he didn't seem all right to me when he left."


"Everybody's different," said Dr. Andrews. "He seemed
happy when he left here, didn't he?"


"Yes."


"We know he isn't completely well," said Dr. Andrews. "But
his father brought him in here. And he could take him home
when he wanted to, you know. He did seem happy when he left
here, didn't he?"


"Yes," I said.


With Enoch gone, that was the end of the twins as a relationship.
They had died in the hospital where they had been born.
Mr. Schurr didn't seem happy or sad when Enoch left. His behavior
changed in a way most strange.


One evening a day or two after Enoch left the hospital, I was
seated before the television set in the recreation room, looking
at the screen, watching a play but not really following it.


Into the room, walking with an air of brisk purpose, came
Mr. Schurr. He saw me, smiled brightly, lifted an arm toward
me in a quick salute touched with urgency. Not stopping nor

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

His lips were turned upward in a thin, intense smirk, filled I
fancied, with cunning purpose. He put his hands, both of them,
over the knob, twisted hard, twisted again as if by a combination
of cunning twists he, from some secret source of knowledge,
could spring the lock of the door. He twisted carefully this way
and that, looking around at me, at first with an air of pride, then
as if he were in search of moral support.


As if he were a soldier following with military obedience
secret instructions of great importance, he worked on the lock,
twisting carefully, sometimes strongly, sometimes gently, at the
knob of the door.


The other patients, playing cards, reading, sitting before the
television set, began to watch Mr. Schurr, too. Silently they
stared at him. He worked on the knob maybe five minutes, then
he backed away in quick, rhythmic, purposeful steps of military
precision, paused for a second, said aloud, "I'm going out this
door."


The other patients pretended to ignore him. Smiling a superior,
knowing smile, he paced quickly back to the door, stood at
attention before it, then went to work on the knob again.


After a while he quit twisting at the knob. Not as if he were
beaten, though, or foiled. Rather as if to say, "Well, we'll leave
this for now and come back to it later. First there's something
else I have to do."


One of the nurses walked into the room. She stood watching
as Mr. Schurr removed his shirt carefully. With quick, methodical,
military precision he folded it into a neat rag and went
back to the door once more. He took the neat, folded rag of a
shirt, placed it over the doorknob and began to move it back
and forth, over and under and around, in brisk, purposeful
polishing motions.


Some of the rest of us stared. Others went about the business

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But I felt that there was a terrible sense of fear running in
a charged current through that room. It was not that Mr. Schurr
appeared violent or angry. It was just that there was about him
an air of strong purpose with which it would be dangerous to
interfere. In the back of my mind came the thought: <i>You are
seeing now, for the first time, a man truly and completely out of
his mind</i>. I watched him in a horror of fascination. <i>Some day,
Dahl, this strange creature, will he be you?</i>


The nurse left the room. Apparently her orders were to leave
him alone, at least for as long as he showed no intention of hurting
the other patients. For when she came back, she sat down
quietly in a chair near the television set where she could observe
Mr. Schurr.


Finally when the doorknob met with his complete approval,
he turned and looked over the recreation room carefully with
piercing stare and then, mind made up, went about further tasks.


First he went to the ping-pong table. With quick urgency he
turned it over carefully, leaving it with the table legs up. Then
he took the paddles and put them neatly and precisely in the
center of the upturned table. He dismantled the net and placed
it, folded, beside the paddles. He looked at the ball a second,
mused, walked over to a box of Chinese checkers marbles,
dumped the marbles on the floor and rapidly thrust the ping-pong
ball into the empty box.


His bull head and heavy chest, under his white undershirt, were
aroll with sweat. Now he began to rearrange the rest of the
room. It seemed that before he left this room, before he untwisted
with his magic combination the knob of the emergency
exit door, before he went home to his wife and children, it had
occurred to him that he should set this recreation room in his
idea of perfect order.


Moving in brisk, military movements, he turned each unoccupied

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then he walked out of the room.


As soon as he left, the other patients, in fear and anger arising
out of that fear, unstacked the chairs, turned the ping-pong
table right side up, and with mutterings, went back to their
watching of television, their playing of card games.


Almost as soon as he had left, Mr. Schurr was back. He
looked the room over. He shook his head briskly back and
forth in a gesture of mild and cheerful disappointment, hesitated
an instant, then walked to the card table. The players
flinched as he came toward them, scowled, inched their chairs,
shuffled feet, busied themselves with their cards, decided the
wise course continued to be one of ignoring Mr. Schurr. They
continued to play.


Now, Mr. Schurr, with a solemn, intense air, broken at stages
of his journey with a quick, flashing smile of satisfaction, seemingly
made a round of absolutions over the heads of the players.
It was as if he were forgiving them for whatever sins they had
committed against him, sins which his smile said he knew only
too well. He paced from one player to the next, and behind
their turned backs, he raised his arms, swept them upward and
outward and together again. In great, prayerful intensity he
repeated precisely the same movements, gazing somberly and
yet benignly at the back of each subject of his benediction.


The game broke up. The players shoved their chairs aside
and, still as if pretending that the presence of Mr. Schurr were
a hideous lie, moved away. Faces averted, they walked from
the recreation room. We other patients, as if on signal, got up,
too, and left the room, and in huddles of muttering talk, based
on fear and disgust, drifted into our own rooms. We felt, in a
way indefinable, that the great, fearful insult which lay behind
the actions of Mr. Schurr was simply that he was a man like

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next morning, before we went to breakfast, I passed the
door of Mr. Schurr's room and watched an attendant bring his
food on a tray. I looked inside. In the night Mr. Schurr had
removed all his bedding from his bed, the sheets, the pillow, the
mattress. He lay flat on his bare mattress, bed linens scattered
around him. He had removed his clothes. Naked he lay there,
seemingly comfortable, at peace. With a knowing, cunning
smile he waved at me.


The attendant quickly placed the tray of food on the floor.
With a happy grin Mr. Schurr rose from the mattress and made a
purposeful step toward the food. The attendant hurriedly closed
the door and thrust a key into the lock.


I heard second-hand what happened to Mr. Schurr on his last
morning at the hospital. There was a kind old mother of a
woman, a female attendant, who told several of us about how
they'd taken Mr. Schurr away.


She talked with sadness, a wistfulness. "They got him dressed
and they got his clothes out for him and packed. I guess they
were trying to keep him from getting any more upset, so they
told him they were going to send him home—and in a way I
guess they figured maybe they weren't really lying, but only
putting it to him in a way which would be best for him and
keep him happy.


"Anyhow, when they told him he was going home, he seemed
to snap out of it a little. He put on his clothes by himself, co-operating
— he never did really bother anybody, you know. He
was always trying to get along and co-operate and be friends
with everybody.


"He got dressed up and, you wouldn't have believed it, but
he seemed really normal there for a while. He combed his hair

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Then they brought him downstairs and two officers from the
sheriff's were there to take him to River's Edge."


Then she said, "When he saw the officers, he bowed his head
for a minute and then he yelled, ‘If you devils want me, come
and get me.’ I think he knew then where he was really going.


"He backed up against the wall—you know how strong he
looked—flattened his back against the wall, spread out his arms
toward the officers. And those two in their uniforms, with their
guns hanging at their sides, they looked at each other. I guess
poor Mr. Schurr seemed pretty dangerous to them, and they
