BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: Oh, man. (chuckles) I guess I had a better week than I have had in a while.
THERAPIST: Oh, good.
CLIENT: I got in the last of a string of freelance assignments that were past their due date. And got feedback on the ones I had turned in earlier, because I hadn't had feedback yet. And my boss said that she was really impressed with them and that I had...
THERAPIST: Oh, terrific.
CLIENT: ...risen to the top of the bunch.
THERAPIST: Good for you.
CLIENT: And they would be happy to keep giving me work. And - because I had been worried. (chuckles) But she said that she was just thrilled with what I was doing.
THERAPIST: Fantastic.
CLIENT: So that was a relief. [00:01:00] It's always (ph) a nice ego boost to hear that you're the best one they've got. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Absolutely. Sure. (chuckles)
CLIENT: So - and, now, I have new assignments that are a little less angst inducing.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: And a new deadline, that I really - it's like a shorter deadline; it's not like a ton of work. It's a smaller chunk that's due in a week. And I don't think I'll have any problem meeting that deadline, especially since now I, sort of, know how it works.
THERAPIST: Well, good.
CLIENT: So it feels good to be in - at least, in a good place with my freelance work.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Although, I haven't - I'm still talking with her about how to do the hours so they may be mad at me when I - when they realize how long I took to do those sections.
THERAPIST: I see, yes.
CLIENT: But, at least, they really liked them. [00:02:00] So that's a good start, I guess. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yes, absolutely.
CLIENT: Yes, so that was really encouraging. And (inaudible) some tough points. I had three days where I just couldn't think, in terms of the freelance writing. And I did a lot of other writing; some fiction, some journaling and some (inaudible) - you know, very casual, personal essay-type stuff, although with quotes (ph). So not, totally, useless but freeform (ph). So I think I, in those three days, wrote 7,000 words of various stuff that wasn't freelance. Maybe, even, a little more. [00:03:00]
They (ph) were notes on the dystopia (ph) stuff, that weren't included. And, I mean, it felt really shitty that I couldn't do my freelance work, when I needed to get those last assignments in...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...order to try to make sure they didn't fire me and all that stuff. But it felt less shitty than in the days when I would just try to work on it, instead of doing other stuff. Or go do something else, that didn't use that part of the brain, like go take a walk and then come back to it...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...which never helped at all.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Being like, "Well, my brain couldn't write freelance stuff, but I wrote like 3,000 words of other stuff." So it's better than my previous alternative.
THERAPIST: Great (ph).
CLIENT: So, even with several days of substantial (ph) failure, I (ph) still feel decent, I guess. [00:04:03] And some of the stuff I wrote was about this, sort of, dissertation idea I came up with, to try to get myself to want to go back to school again. (chuckles) - which I hadn't been, particularly, wanting from any genuine, authentic place. But writing preliminary stuff about this dissertation idea is, actually, making me genuinely want to go back for the first time.
I mean, I wanted to go back very badly but more from, sort of, an outside, prescriptive standpoint; like, "I'm going to have to have some career and I'll like this one better than I'll like others."
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And, also, from a standpoint of pride, it would kill my ego to not get my Ph.D. [00:05:01]
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: But I don't think there's been any sort of genuine desire to (being back) (ph) at that place...
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: ...in over a year. And, looking at this idea, writing about it, reading writers that are more (inaudible) and, also, reading works by the professors who I came here to study with, has given me a much better reason to want to go back. Because (ph) having a specific project that (ph) this place could very concretely help me complete, is much more compelling.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: And I...
THERAPIST: That's what you, actually, really, would be spending your time on, for the most part.
CLIENT: Yes, after - I mean, there would be a year when I wouldn't be working on it but, then, I would start to work on it. [00:06:00] I still haven't gotten in touch with them, or anything. And now that - I turned in the last project of the (inaudible) yesterday.
THERAPIST: For the freelance stuff?
CLIENT: Yes, for the freelance stuff. I wish (ph) (chuckles) - so, now that that's done, I have this new project that is due in a week. So I have to, obviously, work on that every day. But I want to do critical writing and I feel like its [going to go] (ph) more normally; I have a much better feeling about it since - especially, since I've been doing critical stuff in my journal and increasingly focusing on that.
But next week is pretty stressful because - I didn't feel like I could say, "Okay, I'm going to spend this time doing critical writing that I have to do when I have this freelance thing hanging over my head." [00:07:02] But, now, I'm actually going to do that and hope that it is, finally, normal. So its - I'm nervous about it. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yes, sure. Its (inaudible)
CLIENT: Yes. And, between the freelance stuff and my personal writing, I haven't had that much time to be nervous about it. But (pause) - I mean, I feel like now, finally, some things have changed, since finding out about the Wellbutrin and getting good feedback on the freelance stuff and being better about doing the personal writing every day. Last week, I had (ph) thought to myself, "Oh, I've made some good progress on - " I've written some good stuff about the novel and [I've been doing] (ph) my diary, so I'm going to take a few days off from freelance." [00:08:05]
And, of course, what happened was, after a few days of freelance, my mind just totally rebelled and shut off and then I had to spend three days doing only personal writing. So I'm hoping I've, finally, learned the lesson of never taking a day off of personal writing, because I get punished, inevitably.
THERAPIST: I see. [So there's] (ph) sort of backlash.
CLIENT: Yes. And, over the last year, when I - well, more than a year - since I started feeling that personal writing was very necessary to functioning, I've always wanted to find ways to be allowed to take a break, by either making good progress - like writing something really - that I thought was high quality or an insight that was really helpful, or writing a large volume, or by being regular for a while, I always thought I could earn a break. [00:09:03]
THERAPIST: I see.
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: By (ph) good behavior?
CLIENT: Yes. And have a few days to focus on stuff that can get me paid.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: But, I think, the lesson is, now, I can never have a day off, because I will just get punished. But that seems to be the pattern here. (pause) And, hopefully, being good every day will help avoid these periods when my brain just refuses to turn ideas into words for three days. I just want to do things that are, sort of - whatever its (ph) interested in at the moment.
THERAPIST: Is this part of what's got you nervous at the moment - is whether there's going to be any backlash for feeling an interest in going back to school? [00:10:09]
CLIENT: Yes. I mean, a large reason why I just, totally, stopped even trying to clean up the last few things for the things I need to turn in, is that I was afraid I would have trouble doing the freelance stuff - that I might get punished and blocked. And I didn't want to bring that energy back in, when I had freelance stuff to do. (pause) So -
THERAPIST: Do you feel worried, at all, that I'm going to push you, or encourage you, or tell you, you should go back to school? [00:11:02]
CLIENT: No. (pause) I think, at this point, the only people who really do that are my parents. And the other people who might do that, I've just stopped talking to. (laughter)
THERAPIST: (laughter)
CLIENT: It's just sad. Actually, the start of the three-day period in which I couldn't do my freelance work, was when I went out to a café with Jeff (ph) to do some freelance. And, while I was at the café, it went well and I had two really solid hours.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: But I saw two girls who I, (ph) actually, really like, from my cohort (ph), walk into the café. And I turned my back so I was facing the wall and, hopefully, they didn't see me. But one of the girls is the one who I, actually, really hoped to be friends with and who had e-mailed me, when I was taking off, and I never e-mailed her back. [00:12:03] And I felt really bad about it but I just wasn't sure what I would say -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: I was very nervous about saying anything. And I'm very sad about not being friends with her.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: And not being able to even respond to - like, if somebody (ph) e-mails you (inaudible). And actually seeing her, really upset me. (pause)
THERAPIST: In the way it related to things you've lost from all the - ?
CLIENT: Yes, and it just reminded me, in a much more real way, of - you know, I'm (ph) thinking, "Oh, it's so sad that I didn't e-mail her back. And who knows what she thinks? Maybe she thinks I don't like her." It led to thinking about what would I say, if she had seen me, and if we'd run into each other on the street (inaudible) - what on earth would I say? Like, "How can I account for this (ph)?" [00:13:10]
And, then, that led back to just, sort of, remembering the reality of how awful it's been and how school was at the root of all of that. And, I think, part of my ability (ph) to function comes from trying not to remember the reality of that and just how awful I felt. And, not to deny the reality, for sure, but just to try to be in another place, I guess. And, (ph) working on personal writing and thinking about the freelance stuff and spending time with Jeff (ph), it may not be a very rich and varied (ph) existence, but it definitely, sort of, is - it's a (ph) different phase now. [00:14:14]
Like, when I was in Texas, it was definitely like, "Oh, I'm taking a break from school." It was (ph) (inaudible) a break. And I wasn't doing a lot that, really, seemed that it might lead in another direction. Because the novel, at that point - they wouldn't have looked at it. Probably, everyone would - might think it was total crap. (chuckles) I didn't have any job prospects because I was leaving.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And then, I came back and it seemed like I was just trying to get ready to go back to school. And, at this point, I feel like I, finally, have other options, in a way. [00:15:05] My job is not ideal for me, and its caused problems, and it's not something that could go on forever because they're not going to have projects for me forever. But, at least, it is a job and I like my work.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: And, at least, the novel has been appreciated and I have this whole month where I get to go work on it.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: And that's reassuring. I mean, it's almost like I have things to protect me from school, if it is toxic. If they wanted me back, which they might not, and I went back, I would know that I had other options. And, for the longest time, I felt like I didn't because I just don't know if I could go back to journalism with my anxiety at this level. [00:16:04] Because, you know, in journalism, you have to call so many people every day; you have to hound people constantly. A lot of them are hostile (ph) (inaudible), and I could understand why (ph) they would be, because if I were in that position, I'd probably be hostile too. (laughter) Like, everyone (inaudible) me and I feel bad about it but that's (ph) what you get to paid to do when you're in that field...
THERAPIST: (laughter) Right.
CLIENT: ...is harass people. (laughter)
THERAPIST: (laughter) (inaudible)
CLIENT: And I just think that would be a lot [harder for me] (ph) to do now...
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: ...than it was then, because I've been so - having - and not being bothersome is important to me.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: I would feel much more terrible, really getting on people's cases and trying to make them reveal information [to me] (ph).
THERAPIST: I see, yes.
CLIENT: (laughter) I [did a little] (ph) before, but it just means something a little different now. [00:17:00]
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: And, so, I felt like if they'll want me back - I would just have to start (inaudible) and look for a totally (inaudible) -
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: And it wasn't until last - sometime last week, that I really started to feel a legitimate change in my attitude; it's very (ph) recent. Because school (inaudible) is Saturday and I thought - somehow, thought it would be a little later. And I think - I don't know if it will matter. I have no idea what the - I've been checking my e-mail, the school e-mail, once a week and I haven't received a (inaudible). [00:18:01]
So its [still going] (ph) on. I thought it would be nice to get in touch with them before (inaudible) - that there would be something, somewhat, legitimate seeming about that. Maybe that's just, I think, to (ph) - I mean, this is (ph) legitimate (inaudible) (laughter) no matter what I do, really. (inaudible) But I don't think that's realistic. I think I need those to, really, pull everything together. And (pause) - yes, I don't know (inaudible) nervous (ph) about that, since I actually want it now.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: And contacting them, actually, seems possible. Until a few days ago, I just couldn't imagine doing it, because I didn't even want to go back. And it would be the strangest document, because I knew I needed to [face a change,] (ph) and that I wanted to come back, but I wasn't sure that things had changed and I wasn't sure I wanted to go back. (laughter) [00:19:12] So I wasn't sure if I could write that when it (laughter) (inaudible) was true.
And, I guess, reading - looking at the work of one of the professors who I deal (ph) with, is really helpful. Because that made it less about - I think a lot of my anxiety is about (inaudible) imagining - but not like - imagining myself walking through that quad and around the park, after all those failures, knowing that there were people in each building in that quad that knew about my failures - you know, the professors who I (inaudible) - just, imagining being under their gaze on a regular basis. [00:20:07]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And living in this - I don't know (chuckles) - regarded (ph) a failure, constantly.
THERAPIST: Yes, it seems like to me, that would (inaudible) failure.
CLIENT: Yes, totally. I'm just, sort of, imagining myself as a person in that environment, and feeling that all the time, just seems so scary and unappealing. And not just the professors who (inaudible) but my colleagues (ph) (inaudible)
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And imagining talking to them and (sighs) - I mean, it still sounds awful. But, when its less me as a person who's trying to be a grad student or train myself (ph) (inaudible), or do these generic things that are connected with my identity and my future, being someone who has a worthwhile project that Jeffers and (inaudible) that should get written, and that I need help with, changes the focus. [00:21:18]
THERAPIST: (pause) I mean, I think I (pause) - I think the point - I guess, it then becomes much more about the work you have, rather than [people's gaze] (ph).
CLIENT: Yes. [00:22:01] And, somehow, - I mean, I guess, it's not that shocking, because I don't think its uncommon at all, but going to grad school just felt like about me and about my identity; who I was, partly because, I think, doing this work for two years took my focus away from (inaudible). And it sort of buried [the reasons] (ph) why I wanted to go to grad school.
I became, sort of, distant. I remember - I could clearly remember loving discovering certain authors and writing papers, and how fulfilling (ph) for me to write my Honor's pieces. But I wasn't having those experiences. I hadn't had experiences like that [in years] (ph). And, I think, my mind wasn't in that gear (ph); instead of being about work, it just was about me. And the fact that something that was done to me in of the departments (ph) created such a change in me. (inaudible) [00:23:08]
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Because even in, I guess, November I - it just became really apparent that I had this phobia of (inaudible) and then I was crying - first, the class, then before and after the class, then even the day before the class and before the class, in (ph) the class.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: It was clear that something in the department was having this spreading, toxic effect that was getting worse instead of better. And that (ph) easier, to focus on the work instead of myself. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: No kidding, yes.
CLIENT: (pause) And then, when it to spread to the work I was doing for this - when I got to the point where - when I would see the name of one of the authors we read for the class [I was in] (ph), it just seemed like this was a thing that was (ph) bad things everywhere. (chuckles) [00:24:06]
THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible) go through with no real way to get away from it, when you were at school.
CLIENT: Yes, I mean, it's a, shockingly, claustrophobic environment after six years in the city. And I, somehow, hadn't anticipated that at all. (chuckles) I mean, I've never really been in a claustrophobic environment. I went to a big high school. Even when I was homeschooled, I was in several different homeschooling groups, so there were always different, discrete (ph), social groups. And if one wasn't going well, there were others. And, in high school, I didn't like my social group very much but I was in six clubs, which met at lunch a lot. (chuckles) [00:25:02]
So I just tried to [go to] (ph) different clubs a lot, instead of talking to my, quote/unquote, friends. So, I mean, it was always easy to evade (ph) people, but then I came here, and for the first time in my life, it was just impossible.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: (pause [00:25:19] to 00:25:44) Yes, so, it's very strange to know that, within the next couple of weeks, I'll know whether I'll be going back to school or not. And I'm trying not to think about the outcome of it all, because I tend to get depressed when I think about outcomes (ph). [00:26:08] (pause) But, just because I wanted to distance myself from the work, over the last couple months, in order to protect my freelance work and make sure it didn't get contaminated by that energy; although, it did somewhat but never to a (ph) degree. The work for school just felt poisonous, just felt like (inaudible) in a way that the freelance work never felt.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: I would get scrambled and ideas wouldn't turn into words. And I would spend forever writing the same paragraph at times...
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: ...in the way that I would with school, but it just - it didn't get (inaudible) the ideas the work got connected to, I guess. [00:27:05] Somehow, it seems more like even (ph) important ideas and issues that I should be thinking about instead of this stupid paragraph about (inaudible) - (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And I just (ph) knew that, in the (inaudible) back to the things that messed up my work with school. But it seems like there was this...
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Yes, because there was something that I could, actually, do [in the terms] (ph) that would address it.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: I guess, in the last few months, spending significant time writing really (ph) helped.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Whereas, at school, it would help but it seemed like it wouldn't help... [00:28:02]
THERAPIST: (inaudible) college it would help but, often, not help enough. Like it would make it worse not to be (inaudible) your journal, but it wouldn't, necessarily, make it all that feasible (inaudible)...
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: ...no matter how much you were writing (inaudible).
CLIENT: Yes, I mean, the symptoms get worse if I took time off a (ph) -
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know, like intrusive voices and commands. And physical symptoms (ph) would be more pronounced if I wasn't writing in my journal. But, [yes, it's at] (ph) the point where I could be functional.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And it just seemed like I was, still, so baffled and there was still some work to do. And, with the whole - you know, [to explain that] (ph) and to have a - and I had an outline, but I just hadn't found, sort of, a consistent voice that worked. [00:29:04] And (inaudible) I sat down to work on it, there would be things to work on and I would make some progress. It was just, sort of, (inaudible) process. (sighs) And, you know, it actually feels different now, which (inaudible) -
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: (pause) And, I guess, it's (inaudible) with the freelance stuff, I still have those (inaudible) but I've (ph), sort of, bounced back here and there. They keep coming and I (ph) keep succeeding and failing and then succeeding. (chuckles) I've had really, really long failures.
THERAPIST: Right, nor failures - at least as I understand it, that are as tough (inaudible) the process (ph) failing for a while, and then coming back to it, doesn't sound near as, sort of, fraught (ph) and upsetting. [00:30:08] I'm not saying it's easy.
CLIENT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: But the voices and the commands and the - I think, (inaudible) the schoolwork isn't as bad, is that true?
CLIENT: Yes. Yes, it's less - I'm getting orders - go to live in the (inaudible), have contact with everyone or go be a terrorist and end capitalism or else die. (laughter) You know, those orders were pretty impossible to comply with. And, now, I think I'm getting directed more like - sometimes I get questions that I have to answer like "figure out how T.S. Eliot moved from the sick morbidity in his "Sweeney" poems to the mature phase, in which he wrote "Four Quartets." [00:31:09] That's not an easy answer, but it's much better than being a terrorist to end capitalism. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Yes, I would think, in a few different respects.
CLIENT: (laughter) Yes. And, sometimes, when I'm in the middle of freelancing, I'll get (inaudible) like - you know, I'll be listening to (inaudible), which is a string quartet, (inaudible) - and I'll get (inaudible) figure out how (inaudible), melodic structure works. And what it means and how this structure (inaudible) - and I'll have to stop freelancing and turn off the clock and write about (inaudible) for a while. But that's, still, a little (ph) thing to be doing, than some of the things that I was being asked to do in the past, which is nice. [00:32:03]
THERAPIST: Yes, I mean, for one (ph), it's beautiful; it doesn't sound, necessarily, that time-consuming.
CLIENT: Well, it's pretty time-consuming. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Oh, how much time does it take?
CLIENT: Sometimes, three hours.
THERAPIST: Yes. (inaudible)
CLIENT: Sometimes, eight hours.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: This weekend, I spent from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. playing (ph) and writing, going back and forth, because I would get commands to figure certain things out and return to (inaudible) poets, that I liked back in the day. (chuckles) And I had to read all of T.S. Eliot's "Four Quartets" and then, (inaudible) "Sweeney" poems and (chuckles) - [00:33:00]
THERAPIST: Oh, so (inaudible) to figure it out then?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay. It was part of the project, like (inaudible) -
CLIENT: I had to figure it out then.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: (inaudible)
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But I had to take a decent stab at it, like that moment...
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: ...before I could back to -
THERAPIST: Got you.
CLIENT: And I, [totally, did it.] (ph) (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Oh, wow. Do you know why that?
CLIENT: Well, I admit (ph), maybe, that was more conscious. I didn't want to have this project that would just [stretch on] (ph), because it could take me a week to figure that out, really, depending on my standards. So, I think, I felt (ph) one sitting, in which to think about that...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: ...because I want to keep this reasonable. (chuckles) I want to work with these commands, since they're more reasonable than previous ones. But, then, I'd go to sleep on one of them and have to wake up the next morning and continue it, because that could just (inaudible) forever. [00:34:06]
THERAPIST: Got you. I guess, I was also - wonder why that was the command?
CLIENT: Well, yes. I was looking at "Four Quartets", because it's something I've been (inaudible) about (inaudible) time, (inaudible) such as the experience of space (ph). And its (inaudible) productive, with the way I (ph) experience language and the way writers do their work. And, so, I was [sent from] (ph) (inaudible) Eliot and he just suspends time in such an (ph) interesting way. And "Four Quartets" is, by far, his best work, much better than the "Wastelands" (ph), although not everyone thinks that; but, they're wrong. (laughter) [00:35:06]
THERAPIST: (inaudible) (laughter)
CLIENT: And it's just (inaudible) to compare that to his "Sweeney" poems, which have this weird, (inaudible) interest, in that they will bring in (inaudible) - we would, sort of, (inaudible) some of them (inaudible) on the door, as death and mortality. But, in the way - I think they consciously play with (inaudible). And they bring in these very, incongruous elements and very - you know, they're disturbing and I don't think, as artistic achievements, they're that high (ph),necessarily, (inaudible) interesting.
And its, sort of, remarkable to see him bringing - going from these really fragmentary (inaudible) to "Four Quartets", which is a (inaudible). [00:36:06] So I - you know, one of the "Sweeney" poems is part of the basis of the paper, which I -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: And so, I guess, those poems have been significant for me and (chuckles) -
THERAPIST: Yes, sure.
CLIENT: And -
THERAPIST: (inaudible) figure out how he got from the earlier, sort of, (inaudible) interesting work, (inaudible) the caliber of the "Four Quartets".
CLIENT: Yes, and the "Quartets", I think, are poetic (ph), that they incorporate these aspects like (inaudible). And [structured beats] (ph) were musically inspired, yet (ph) they are like, sort of, consumed well by language. [00:37:06] And they don't (inaudible), "Oh, look, there's this rapping on the door," and we actually see that described in text like "knock, knock". And that (ph) is in the poetic line, it's not outside it.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: And much (inaudible) done?
CLIENT: Yes, and the remarkable thing is - and, all of Eliot is (inaudible) but, in some of work, there will be an image or just like, sort of, a scenario, that sticks out beyond what he (inaudible) the language. The language cannot, sort of, help you figure out the image. And it's sort of disturbing, because you're left with some things that text (ph) helps you deal with. [00:38:02] - necessarily a bad thing. But, then, the experience of "Four Quartets" is so different, because the language [is so rich] (ph), in every line, and it doesn't present notes (ph) that are completely beyond the scope of what the text deals with, like with its own construction.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Yes. And, I guess, I would describe it as a much more mature work but it's not - it's sort of misleading, because it sounds like I'm privileging (ph) it because of some (inaudible) achievement. But I, also, in a sense, I (inaudible) that on values. It's a better poetic - that's what poetry is supposed to do, instead of (inaudible) that [would be in] (ph) music and paint is supposed to do - that the text of them doesn't really help you deal with or break down in any way. [00:39:06]
So, I mean, in Eliot's early work, he'll have relayed (ph) things like (inaudible) in one of "Sweeney" (inaudible) - that Sweeney killed - like murdered a woman, embalming (ph) her in Lysol. (laughter) And, even just one line of that, I think about mortality and, sort of, ways of dealing with death. And it takes place at this party but, because its (inaudible), singsong (ph), simplistic, silly work, it just seems - it just feels, sort of, wrong, something like that, in a work...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: ...of that nature. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yes. Yes. [00:40:02] Yes, like a movie that's a, sort of, lighthearted movie, that (inaudible) very serious or evocative theme, sort of, doesn't have a right to.
CLIENT: Yes, and I'm not sure that it's an aesthetic failure, because - I mean, of course, with (inaudible) - commenting on that very thing so - (laughter)
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yes.
(Crosstalk)
CLIENT: No. And, you know, I don't think anyone would (inaudible) a better work than "Four Quartets" but the exact reasons why are interesting. And, in another one of his works, he - either I don't remember whether it's the (inaudible) character, but he crucified women (ph) and covers her body with honey so fire ants will eat her, and she will die a slow, painful death. [00:41:01] And that's not so complex or well written. And, so, he has these, sort of, psychotic (inaudible) ways of dealing with mortality and...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: ...time and - but (inaudible) - And the way in which he wrote the "Four Quartets", it's remarkable, having (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Through his own (inaudible) faith that people can, actually, mature and change. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: Like terribly murdering women is not, actually, the answer to figuring out how death works; [its getting it closer.] (ph) (laughter)
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: So, I don't know.
THERAPIST: I guess, I just wonder if that's partly why I wasn't interested - (chuckles)
CLIENT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (inaudible) a big question; an important one.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: We [need to] (ph) stop for now, but we'll talk more.
CLIENT: Okay, I'll see you next week.
THERAPIST: Yes.
