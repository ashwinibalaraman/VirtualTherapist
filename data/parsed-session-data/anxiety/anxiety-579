Transcript:
<b>DR:</b> Well, how have you been feeling since we spoke last?
<b>PT:</b> Just about the same.
<b>DR:</b> What's been happening?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well, you know, [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, like I hear different things.  He won't tell me, you know.  It's, it's through other people that I hear, hear different things, but I just don't, I just can't, uh, I just can't go with this wife.  I mean she's been married, this is, you know, [NAME OTHER] the fifth husband.
<b>DR:</b> Fifth husband, and, and did something happen that caused you to be alarmed?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well he, he didn't take his meds for two days, and I guess he was moody or something and they took the, the kids out to [DEIDENTIFIED], and he took the kids and he left her, I guess, in, um, in the swimming pool or whatever, and then my ex sister in law's sister come to pick up [NAME OTHER] cousins.  There was two children.
<b>DR:</b> So there was a big group of kids and —
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] was supervising all of them?
<b>PT:</b> Right.  And she had phoned her brother, um, from [DEIDENTIFIED], to come down to speak to [NAME OTHER] because —
<b>DR:</b> About what?
<b>PT:</b> Not, not paying enough attention to her.
<b>DR:</b> Not paying enough attention.  Not this issue about the violence and all that stuff?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no.  No.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  They don't ever hear about that.  I mean do they ever hear that she did this stuff that she's done to him, but —
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So he's supposed to come down.  What, what he's supposed to do, intimidate him or just talk to him?
<b>PT:</b> Oh well, [NAME OTHER] told me that he had packed up five boxes of [NAME OTHER] things.  That she wanted him out, but then when I was talking to [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] says, no, mom, that didn't happen and he says, I said why don't you tell me these things?  He says because I don't want to upset you, you know.  I don't want you upset.  I said sooner or later, I hear about them.
<b>DR:</b> Quite a bit of drama in all this.
<b>PT:</b> I'm sick of it.  I am so sick and tired of this.
<b>DR:</b> Now, the child, she seems to be taking it as it comes, or how is she handling things?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Oh, this woman is as sweet as she can be.
<b>DR:</b> She's good to [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  She's very good to [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Well, it could be worse then.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You think she's doing that to be manipulative or what's —
<b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.
<b>DR:</b> Because she knows that will keep [NAME OTHER] around no matter what she does, if she acts good to the child?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I think that's probably right.  She's probably been through this rodeo a couple of times and —
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  I'm telling you.
<b>DR:</b> But she isn't as critical of [NAME OTHER], is that right as the first wife?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, she is.  Like she, um, she e—mailed me, like I had said how's, I e—mailed her and I said how was the water park, and she, she e—mailed me back, oh, you don't want to know.  I had to call my brother, and, um, I said to my husband, I said, well, you know, [NAME OTHER] called, [NAME OTHER] called her brother and, um, her brother come down from Oklahoma and I guess they were going to throw [NAME OTHER] out or something.  I don't know, and, uh, he said [PATIENT NAME], he says don't get involved.  So —
<b>DR:</b> What, what was your understanding of the reason for her being upset in the first place?
<b>PT:</b> Because he was moody.  He wouldn't talk to her.
<b>DR:</b> So, because he missed his medicine for a while, and that's what —
<b>PT:</b> Two days.
<b>DR:</b> And the point of it being that he wasn't paying sufficient attention —
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> To her.
<b>PT:</b> I mean everybody loves her.  I mean she says, like she works for an apartment complex.  She's like the manager, and, um, the gardener loves her.  The, this one loves her.  That one loves her.  I mean everybody loves her.  I mean she's —
<b>DR:</b> Loves her in a sense that she needs the constant praise.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She's very —
<b>DR:</b> Not necessarily that she's unfaithful or —
<b>PT:</b> No.  No, she's very, um, manipul, manipulative.  I can't say that word.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> But, um, you know.  [NAME OTHER] said there's something wrong with her, you know.  He says you sit and you talk to her, and she has to be the center of attention.  She has to have, you know.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> So your depression doesn't seem to be getting worse, but it's not getting better either?
<b>PT:</b> No.  No.  I have trouble sleeping because, believe it or not, I mean, you know, [NAME OTHER] is [AGE], and he'll say please don't worry about me.  I said mothers always, I'll always worry about you.  I said just the same as you'll always worry about [NAME OTHER].  I said you'll worry about [NAME OTHER] until the day you die.  I said, and you know.  Oh, mom, don't worry about it.  I can handle it.  I can handle it.
<b>DR:</b> Does, does the, pardon me, does the diazepam help your, uh, your worry symptoms?
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, if I take two.  I take two.
<b>DR:</b> You take two.  You take two at a time, or you mean you just —
<b>PT:</b> Two at a time.  Two at a time.
<b>DR:</b> Well, they come in 10 mg.  Uh, the other aspect I was thinking of is the, the depression has been relatively treatment resistant and I thought, I know this is a potent medicine to even mention, but there's a medicine called Abilify and it's been approved for treatment resistant depression, but I kind of reserve it for the cases where people are really functionally deteriorating.  So it'll probably be better if I just sent you home with some information to read about it instead of deciding today whether or not you would use it.  I, I do think though if you see it as just an episode of anxiety versus, you know, really the anxiety worsening, I don't necessarily think that you need to use the stronger strength, but they do come in 10 mg strength.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, it helps me sleep too if I, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe what we'll do is give you the 10s and give you enough to kind of cover this episode then.  We'll increase it from five to 10.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> What about as far as you and [NAME OTHER], how are you all getting along?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, we get along fine.
<b>DR:</b> His heart condition has stabilized, thank God.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How's he, how's he taking all that?
<b>PT:</b> Um, as a matter of fact, he's got a sense of humor now.
<b>DR:</b> He's got, he took it in stride.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Here's, he's, he's the [INAUDIBLE].  He could, he [INAUDIBLE].  He probably could drive himself to the hospital better than I could.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, well, he did drive himself to the hospital, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Just amazing.
<b>PT:</b> I said why, you know, we were talking the other day.  I said why didn't you, you know, it keeps going over in my mind, why didn't you tell me, I said.  I'm your, your soul mate.  Why didn't you say, you know, I'm going to the hospital because I, I'm, I feel like I'm having a heart attack, I said and I would have drove.  He said, but instead he said I'm just going to go and have this checked out, you know.
<b>DR:</b> He still tried to talk them out of it, and tried to get out of it, didn't he?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He didn't want, you know, oh.  He said I don't want, I didn't want you to worry.  Well, hello.
<b>DR:</b> Well, bless your heart.  I know that was hard.
<b>PT:</b> You know.  I mean he knows he's adopted and, and, uh, he had, had wonderful parents.  His father is deceased.  His mother is in a, a nursing home.  You know, and I thought to myself, you know, you may have come into this world alone, but you know, you ain't going out alone, you know, if God forbid.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> You know.  I just.
<b>DR:</b> Well at least that part has been, even though the other, [NAME OTHER] is still troublesome, that part is, that was God, a major catastrophe there.
<b>PT:</b> But, uh —
<b>DR:</b> What about being around people?  Do you tolerate that okay?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Huh—uh.  No.  As a matter of fact, yesterday, when I went to get my nails done and I was talking to the girl there, I just, and then I just buttoned up because it just seemed like everybody was talking, talking, talking and I was, you know, I started, start getting a headache.  I just, just wanted to get out of there.  I just, I'd rather be by myself.
<b>DR:</b> I think it's the right thing to do to try to use something to help you with that.  I mean as a medicine [INAUDIBLE].  The pills break in half.  You can break them in little bitty pieces and space it out however you want to.  I just think that maybe in your case, you handled things just fine when the crisis was going on, and now the aftermath is with us, and, and you're feeling depressed.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't want to start about Canada with my sisters.  I mean —
<b>DR:</b> What is the status?  I mean are you going up there this year or what's —
<b>PT:</b> I've been up.  We were, we went up.
<b>DR:</b> I remember you were going to go up there.
<b>PT:</b> We went up there, and when I was up there, my brother in law, who had a heart attack, um, ten years ago, they rushed him to the hospital and now he's a diabetic.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> And he was in there for four days, and my sister, she didn't tell anybody that he was in there, and her and I got into it.  I'm the eldest, and she's the middle sister, and then I have a baby sister.  Um, I said what are you trying to become, a martyr.  She didn't even tell her son that her dad, that his dad was in the hospital, you know, um, till about two days into it, she, she finally told [NAME OTHER] that, you know, [NAME OTHER] was in the hospital, but now he's on insulin four times a day.  I mean I got into it with her, and —
<b>DR:</b> And what was the subject of that?
<b>PT:</b> Why didn't she let us know?  I mean I was there.  I could have, you know, and my sister, like my sister [NAME OTHER] is [AGE].  [NAME OTHER] is [AGE], and I'll be [AGE] in November.  I mean why didn't she say something to somebody?  You know, why did she, you know, keep it all on her shoulders, um, I, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> That doesn't make sense.  You didn't tell them, you told them that [NAME OTHER] was sick, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Then why wouldn't they share that with you, because they probably, since he had a heart condition before —
<b>PT:</b> Well —
<b>DR:</b> They think he was dying or something?
<b>PT:</b> Probably.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> It is pretty serious.  I mean I already know that, and I look at that guy, what's his name, Billy Mays, you look pretty young and healthy and he's gone like that.
<b>PT:</b> I know.  I know.
<b>DR:</b> Michael Jackson, of course, was drugs, but I mean there's, there's a, there's a [INAUDIBLE] to life, and, and, uh, some people handle it different.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I'm glad that it, you were able to see them.
<b>PT:</b> And I also saw my mother.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh —
<b>DR:</b> Now, she's in a —
<b>PT:</b> She's in a home.
<b>DR:</b> That's what I thought.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she has Alzheimer's, but she, when we walked in there, I was [NAME OTHER] my sister, and [NAME OTHER], we walked in there and she was having lunch, and as soon as I walked in there, she knew me right off the bat.
<b>DR:</b> Wonderful.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She knew me.
<b>DR:</b> That's so sweet.  How long has it been since she's been able to see you and know you?
<b>PT:</b> Oh gosh, maybe about three years.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.  That's really neat.
<b>PT:</b> Yep, she knew me.
<b>DR:</b> Bless your heart.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh, we hugged and I said well, I'll, I'll let you eat your lunch and you can see, we'll just sit there.  Oh no, she had to get up and she, you know —
<b>DR:</b> Oh, how sad.
<b>PT:</b> And, and the little lady that was sitting beside her, she says, yeah, she says you go and you, you go with your daughter.  She's more important than lunch.
<b>DR:</b> Well, thank God.  She had a good day.  You got to see her.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> That's just wonderful.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but she really shocked me though the way that she looked, you know.  Like I always remember her being, you know, fun mom, but you know —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> She's just so slow now and, and wrinkled and, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Are they taking good care of her in there?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It sounds like maybe she's doing better in there than she was before.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I, I know they, they, in that type of health system, they take better care of you and sort of presiding over you than they do diagnosing and treating expensive things.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> At least part is, is piece of mind for you because wasn't there some bickering among the, the daughters about the care and —
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How this should be and that should be?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly.
<b>DR:</b> Some of that has been taken out because now you can't argue with the people at the —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] home.  Go up there and state your case, but it's not, that's the way it is, you know.
<b>PT:</b> But, you know, she's, um, she'll ask questions like, you know, my mother, my mother is dead, isn't she?
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Now, you haven't had any forgetfulness.  We've talked about that before.  You don't have forgetfulness.
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I do.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes you do.  You don't have the kind though that you forget, like the difference between saying where's my car keys and somebody shows you the keys and you said those aren't my keys.
<b>PT:</b> Oh no.
<b>DR:</b> I mean you know they're —
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean to me, that's, that's concentration problems, not a true memory loss.  I mean you never have trouble recognizing it's your house or —
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> How to operate the microwave or any of that stuff.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> No.  No.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's just, it's scary when you have a parent with a, with a disease like that.  You wonder what's going to happen to you.
<b>PT:</b> See, and my grandfather had it too.  Her father had it.
<b>DR:</b> It's probably because people live longer now.  I mean they tell us if you live to be 100, 100% of people will have prostate cancer and probably the equivalent is uterine cancer, and 100% of people are going to have some form of dementia.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, it's just we live longer now.  We just want to make sure they're good years and healthy years.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Because your depression was never really the kind that you hallucinate, or get suicidal or you don't have any psychotic symptoms.  You never get speeded up or racing thoughts, anything like that.
<b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.  No.
<b>DR:</b> Now, yours has been purely on the low side, and it comes and goes.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and when it comes, man, it comes.
<b>DR:</b> Well maybe we can, maybe we can alleviate some of the anxiety because it sounds some of the practical things are really a little better.  I mean compared to where we were the last time, [INAUDIBLE] than it is now.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It was definitely uncertain.  I, I didn't know if you were going to be a widow next time we got together.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.  Oh, and then I would have to be in a rubber room.
<b>DR:</b> Imagine that?  So, but he's, he's trying to take better care of himself and do more what the doctor says and.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It has a way of sort of focusing the mind.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> Lying there in an ICU bed and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Yeah, your health is so important.
<b>DR:</b> Thank God you enjoy good health, occasional joint ache here and there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you don't see any things that are, that are out of control, but it's sort of the same nagging problems.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I do think making this adjustment is the right thing to do.  I think the Pristiq has agreed with you.  I wouldn't change anything about that.  I do think that those other guys have to be adjusted, and, and what I like about the pills is they easily break into little pieces.  You can take the half and break it in half if you want to, and, and adjust the dose down however suits you, but I'll give you enough to, to double it so that when those times come where you're more tense.  And no panic symptoms?  You don't suddenly feel like you're dying or anything like that?
<b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.  Just when [NAME OTHER] went to the hospital.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I imagine.  That must [INAUDIBLE].  That didn't go well.  It turned out good though.
<b>PT:</b> It did.  A lot of prayers.
<b>DR:</b> And you do have some circle of friends down here?  Not as much as you'd like, but some people?
<b>PT:</b> Some people, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Has [NAME OTHER] new job changed anything, or how's that been?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'll only let him work four days a month because, and he goes in there when the residents are in there.  So he's got help, and I'm, I think he just goes in there to hear the gossip between you and I, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Well, there is a lot of gossip out there.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Lord knows that place has got stories.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's not as bad as the prison system though.  Everybody is doing something.  It's Peyton Place over there, but, uh, but UT, the health center up there is definitely not, uh, it's never a dull moment, let's just say that.  So you feel okay.  We'll going to leave the Pristiq the same, don't add any other antidepressant aspects to it.  We'll just let you go home and review that stuff about Abilify because you'll probably see some ads about it.  You'll see some commercials.  Um, the thing that I, that I suggest is that what it might take away for your condition is that thoughts going around and around in your mind and you can't turn your mind off.  And it isn't as bad now as it used to be.  Do you remember?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So, so I think the diazepam is much less expensive, and it's less side effect prone, but if that were to ever flare up, I want you to know there are things that can be done.  So don't ever feel oh, there's nothing else to do.  There's, there's lots of other stuff, and this is a, this is an old treatment.  We had this a long time ago when I was in training.  We would give people antipsychotic medicine that weren't, weren't psychotic because the, the chemical dopamine has some influence on that thought process, the maddening, can't turn your mind off symptoms.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, and we would use a little dose of it, and it, it would surprise, that's how they got to be called tranquilizers.  It calms your mind of that particular aspect, but this medicine leaves you clear enough that you're not sedated.  The downside risk to it as you get older, there has been some theory that there's a higher rate of morality in elderly people.  They were really demented.  The situation was, it's not even this medicine.  It was medicines similar to this —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> That were being, being tested on Alzheimer's patients and were trying to get indications for what's called dementia psychosis, people that were agitated —
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Or demented, and, uh, they found that they looked at the two groups, and not because of necessarily the medicines made them die, but the groups that took the medicine died more often than the ones that didn't take it.  So I think it was 1.6 increased mortality in the ones that took it that versus didn't.  And still if they died, it was the same thing old people die of.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But nevertheless, there's that warning, and it's a class warning.  It's called a black box warning, and it's given to every, every agent that is used, that's psycho active in that group.  That's, that's what you'll see is the biggest warning on it, and then people that are predisposed to be diabetic, sometimes there were cases that people became diabetic that didn't know they were diabetic [INAUDIBLE] like you were talking about.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, there's no way to give you diabetes, but if you, if you didn't know it, and you were predisposed to have it, sometimes it came out in these people.  So it has to be monitored, and it isn't just this medicine.  This is also a class warning.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> So, it's something you'll see in the material when you get it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Well, what questions do you have about what we're going to do?
<b>PT:</b> None.
<b>DR:</b> Pretty much makes sense?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I'm glad you let me do it.  I wish that, uh, things were different, some of the family things.  That maybe would help.
<b>PT:</b> One day, doc.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know, for all that, [NAME OTHER] seems like he's doing what he wants to do.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, but [NAME OTHER] is, [NAME OTHER] has a heart as big as gold.  I mean his, his ex wife was in the hospital.  She just recently, she got out two days ago.  She was in there for four days.  She had a spinal tap, and she went home and it was leaking.  So she went back and they couldn't stop it from leaking.
<b>DR:</b> Did a patch or something, one of those —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] things.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, and so they couldn't stop it from leaking.  So I mean she phones up [NAME OTHER] at work because she knows he's around that area, and she goes could you please stop in and bring me two diet, diet Cokes.  I mean this, this guy, he does everything for, I said don't let [NAME OTHER] find out, I said, or you're going to be in big trouble.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Well, you're right about that.
<b>PT:</b> You know.
<b>DR:</b> That certainly would stir up the old [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Oh, you're not kidding, but I mean it's, it's, it's just being a good person.  He's just a good, he's just a good kid.  I still call him a kid.  [NAME OTHER] says you know —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, he's, he's older than a kid.
<b>PT:</b> He's a man.
<b>DR:</b> I understand the sentiment.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I think that's a good thing about him.  I think that you can feel good about being a parent to him, that you have given him positive feedback about being compassionate to people that need your help and that's, that's a trait that probably he learned from you.  So that's good.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I think, for my part, I would not suggest that we change any of the medicine.  Uh, we're going to leave it like it is, and you tell me if we need to do something [INAUDIBLE] get through the fall and see how things are going.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And we'll go from there.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, let's go —
