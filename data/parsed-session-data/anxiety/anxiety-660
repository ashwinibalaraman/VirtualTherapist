<i>It's 1976 and I'm twenty-eight years old. When Peter was</i>
offered a marketing position with IBM in Montgomery, Alabama, we
decided he should take it. We had come to enjoy the slower pace of
the Southern lifestyle. We live in a three-bedroom ranch-style house
in a small subdivision. I'm considering applying for a teaching job at a
local preschool, but for now my job is homemaker and mother.


It's November 2, and I'm sitting on the brick-style linoleum floor
of our kitchen, playing house with Claire and Beth, when the phone
rings. I hand the doll that Claire and I just wrapped in a receiving
blanket to Beth, along with a plastic baby bottle filled with water we
were pretending was formula.


"Would you please feed the baby for me while I answer the
phone?" I ask, smiling.


"I'll change <i>my</i> baby's diaper so she'll stop crying, Mommy,"
Claire says, full of enthusiasm. She reaches for her own doll and a
newborn-size Pamper while I scurry to the phone, hoping to catch
it before the third ring. Three-year-old Annie is napping, and I don't
want her to be awakened.

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Catherine, he took a knife to my throat," the voice on the other
end whispers. "I'm afraid he'll kill me. I don't know what to do. Tell
me what to do."


I gasp, pull the receiver cord into the laundry room, and close
the door. My chest tightens. I'm shocked to hear from her. Mom and
I haven't spoken since the day we ran out of their house when we
returned from Germany almost three years ago. Heart pounding, I
imagine my father coming toward her with a butcher knife.


"Mom?"


"Yes, dear. Please, help me. You're so sane. Tell me what to do."
She sounds sober and desperate.


"Is Dad there?"


"No, he just stepped out to the store." Her voice is trembling.


"Leave, Mom, right now. Go stay with one of your friends and
call the police."


"No. I can't do that. It has to be someone we don't know. He'd
kill me."


My mind flashes back to the piano he destroyed with a hammer.


"Go to the rectory then," I plead, "or the convent, <i>immediately</i>.
They'll give you shelter and find a counselor for you."


"I already tried that. They can't help... Oh, no!... I have to
go now. I hear him." Her voice is faint. "Don't call. I'll call you." She
hangs up.


Dazed with fear, heart still pounding, I stand in the nearly dark
room and stare at the pile of dirty clothes on the floor. I pray to my
grandmother: <i>Ammy, if there really is a communion of saints like we
were taught in school and you are a part of it, with any power at all,</i> do
something. Please, <i>your daughter needs help!</i>


"Who was it, Mommy?" Claire asks when I return to the kitchen,
feeling numb. "Why do you look so scared?"


"Are you scared?" Beth chimes in, wide-eyed.


I wish they hadn't noticed. "No, I'm not scared," I lie, stooping to
rejoin them. "I just had a serious talk with somebody, and... it was
a little upsetting."

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>That night is election night, and I stay up watching the</i>
presidential returns, drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, and eating
chocolate candy left over from Halloween while Peter and the children
sleep.


The next morning, fueled on candy, tired from lack of sleep, but
elated at Jimmy Carter becoming our next president, I pull out of
the driveway with Annie to pick up her sisters from preschool. By
the time we get to the entrance of our subdivision I am in a state of
panic: Heart racing out of control, I break into a sweat and feel my
body becoming weak. What's happening? Am I having a heart attack?
Am I dying? Terror-stricken, I turn the station wagon around and race
back through the neighborhood, a thirty-five-mile-an-hour zone, at
eighty miles per hour. All I can think about is getting Annie to a place
of safety.


I drive straight to my neighbor's house and use the last of my
energy to bang on her front door. Susan runs toward the foyer to greet
me. "Cathy?... Is that you?" She swings open the door. "What happened?"
she exclaims. "You're gray!"


"Dial 911," I plead. "I don't know what's wrong with me... Get
Annie out of the car, and call Peter and tell him to go pick up Claire
and Beth. <i>Please!"</i>


She hops into action. I lie down on the couch, too weak to stand.
Paramedics arrive within minutes, and a frantic scene ensues: sirens
blaring, lights flashing, stretcher, oxygen tank. Susan holds Annie in
her arms and they watch while paramedics take my vital signs, ask
questions, and give me oxygen. Susan calls my doctor to tell him
they're bringing me to his office, and the paramedics strap me on a
stretcher, wheel me into the ambulance, and depart. Susan and Annie
follow in my station wagon.


At the doctor's office, the nurse greets us with news that he has
just left for lunch. In the exam room, she apologizes for his absence
and tells me my heart rate is well over 200, but she has no idea what's
wrong or how to treat it. Meanwhile, Susan holds and comforts Annie,
who eventually falls asleep in her arms, while I lie on the exam table,

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When the doctor finally arrives, he hooks me up to an EKG.


"Your EKG is normal," he says. "You had an anxiety attack."


"An anxiety attack?" I ask. "How could that be? I'm not anxious."


"Well, apparently you're a lot more anxious than you realize. How
are things between you and your husband?"


"They're fine... great," I reply. "We have a good marriage."


"Here," he says with a patronizing smile, then looks down and
scribbles on a pad of paper. "I'm giving you a prescription for Inderal.
I want you to take it for a couple of weeks. It will keep your heart rate
normal. And here's a prescription for Valium to treat your anxiety."


"I told you, I'm not anxious about anything," I reply, insulted.
"I'm happily married. I have great kids and good friends. I like my life,
and I don't need pills."


He smiles again, looks down at me, and hands me the prescriptions.
"Give us a call if you have any more trouble with your heart,"
he says, walking out the door.


I clench my jaw, put my clothes back on, and stomp out of the
room.


<i>I take the Inderal for two weeks and throw away the</i>
Valium prescription. I still don't trust my body, but I'm convinced
there are healthier alternatives to pills, things that can help me prevent
an episode like that from ever happening again. I research internists in
the area and find a doctor highly recommended by a trusted friend.


"I have three children under the age of five," I tell his secretary.
"I'm their mommy. I have to stay well for them. Please, find me an
appointment as soon as possible."


After extensive tests, including a six-hour glucose tolerance test
during which I have another attack, the new doctor diagnoses me as
hypoglycemic and explains that my attacks were, in his opinion, not

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm eager to tell Peter about my appointment, but once again, life
sends me on an unexpected detour. As I walk in the kitchen door, the
phone rings and I answer it.


"Hello?"


"Hi, Cath!" It's Mom. Her voice is loud and cheery. "Things are
so much better, Catherine," she spouts, without asking one question
about how any of us are. "Your father figured out that he's hypoglycemic,
and now that he's on the correct diet, everything's fine."


Energy drains from my body. I feel like I'm being sucked into the
quicksand of a mysterious, dangerous land. How can Dad and I have
the same thing, diagnosed at the same time? Does it mean I'm becoming
like him? But what she's saying just doesn't make sense.


"Everything's fine? Do you really think so, Mom? He was trying
to kill you last time you called. How can that kind of behavior be fixed
by a diet?"


"Well, dear, we're both so excited. We've always thought something
was wrong with him, but we never knew what. This must have
been it all along. Now that his moods are more balanced, he's very
chipper."


"Chipper?... Dad's been chipper before, Mom... and then
he gets depressed, and then angry and then violent. <i>Please,</i> go see a
counselor."


"Okay, dear, I will.... So, how are things with you and Peter
and the girls?"


I know she's lying. She won't see a counselor. She wants to change
the subject, and I comply. I tell her Peter and I are fine. I tell her
about watching my girls at play... how they caravan single file out
to the yard carrying blankets, dolls, books, stuffed animals. Claire is

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Peter and I make love that night. I suspect I'm ovulating,</i>
and tell him so before we begin. He grins and rolls toward me: "Well,
we've never felt our family was complete, Cath," he says. "Maybe it's
just the right time, you know what I mean?"


I smile, hoping to enter into the miracle of conception, and we
nestle together. I believe that if Peter and I love each other, and keep
having babies, it will be a lot of work, but there will always be something
to be happy about. Our family won't have time to become morose,
like the family I grew up in. And my girls will never feel as lonely
and outcast as I often did as a child and adolescent. Also, having babies
was something the McCall family was good at. Peter's brother
John and his wife have five children. His sister and her husband, six,
and David and his wife, whom Peter and I have become closest to,
have eight. They are our models; we want to be like them.


Three weeks later, when we learn I'm pregnant, we're ecstatic.
But I'm also scared. My body betrayed me that day after the election.
I can't trust it as I could when I was pregnant with the other three.
Will my baby be safe inside me? I keep the fear to myself, trying to
be strong, but soon stoicism turns into loneliness, and I long for my
mother. I want her the way she is on the rare occasions when she's
sober: kind, loving, fun.


She's an early riser, so I call at 7:30 in the morning, figuring the
odds are in my favor that she hasn't started drinking yet.

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"The baby's due August 16," I tell her.


"You're kidding, Cath... August 16 is our wedding anniversary."


"Yeah, I know. Quite a coincidence, isn't it?"


"Well, it certainly is. A coincidence and a blessing. I'm just
thrilled with your news."


Several days later she calls to see how I'm feeling, but quickly
shifts the conversation back to Dad's "chipper mood," her joy at becoming
a grandmother again, and then her big news: She's tired of
living so far away from the girls. She and Dad have sold the house and
are moving to Alabama to live near us.


My jaw drops. How did this happen so fast? I stare at Peter, who's
sitting in front of me at the kitchen table. I point to the phone while
silently wording "It's my mother! They've sold the house! They're
moving here!"


He leans back, resting his chair against the wall. "What?" he
whispers, and waits until Mom and I say goodbye.


I hang up the phone, and plop myself into the chair opposite
him. "Whew!"


"Okay, Cath, what's the story?" he says, tilting his head. "Have
they really sold the house on Montgomery Place? They're moving
here?"


"That's what she said...."


He eases his chair into position and leans forward, looking into
my eyes. "I need to hear the rest of the conversation," he says.


"Okay... well..." I'm fiddling with a handful of crayons
the children left on the table. "First of all, she kept telling me Dad's
diet has completely changed him. He's stopped acting so angry and
bizarre."


Peter rolls his eyes. "Yeah, right."


"I'm with you. I don't trust it. What if something triggers him
later on?" I sigh, tapping the table with a crayon. "I mean, I still think
he's capable of murdering her." My stomach tightens at the thought.


"I think you're right," Peter says. "And your mother's not the
most reliable person herself. I mean, she <i>seems</i> like she's been sober for

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I know... it scares me." My body tenses. "But what if it's an
answer to prayer? I even think Ammy might have something to do
with it. I've been praying to her ever since that day Mom called begging
me to help her."


Peter sighs. "I know.... Maybe we should give them the benefit
of the doubt. They're getting older. Maybe they <i>are</i> trying to amend
their lives. Who are we to stand in their way? But shit," he runs his
hands through his hair and adjusts his glasses, "we could have some
tough times ahead."


<i>Lucy and Paul call the night before movers are due to pick</i>
up Mom and Dad's things from the house in Brooklyn, and Lucy
speaks first: "Sorry, Cath, but all I can say is good luck, and you can
have em."


I'm scared, hearing this. Is Peter's prediction already coming true?


"Mom's been smashed for three days," she continues. "When Paul
and I left tonight, she was hanging out the kitchen window on the second
floor, throwing hundred-dollar bills to people on the street."


The image sickens me as I brace myself for her next words: "Dad's
been on a tirade, yelling and cursing at her and at us. He's nothing but
a pain in the ass. I feel sorry for you and Peter." My heart races.


Paul is on the extension now. "Yeah, be careful," my baby brother
says. "They're horrible."


"Shit, Paul, I hoped this wouldn't happen," I reply. "They ruined
our childhoods. They're not going to ruin my children's. I won't let
them."


"Sorry, Cath. But we thought we should give you some warning."


"Thanks. It'll help us prepare. Talk to you soon." I slam the receiver
down and sigh.

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Mom and Dad buy a little cluster home ten minutes</i>
away from us and appear happy to begin a new life. In spite of my
worries, we get along well with them during the first few months,
helping them get settled, showing them around town, having them
over for dinner every couple of weeks. They seem happy and sober,
and I begin to think a normal relationship with them might
be possible. Then my labor begins the morning of their anniversary,
and our daughter Rose is born healthy and beautiful the next
day, August 17, 1977. We are unable to show my parents as much
attention, and within weeks Mom begins drinking again. Drunk,
she calls to tell me how concerned she is about Dad's dark moods.
When Peter or I try to check on them, they lock their front door
and refuse to speak to us. By the time Rose is two months old, I
break into a panic attack at the mere thought of having to leave the
house on an errand. This time I know the causes of my symptoms
are more than physical.


I ask my doctor for a referral to a psychiatrist, who, after hearing
the current situation with my parents, says, "Mrs. McCall, your parents
are two very sick human beings. You and your husband need to
move away from them as soon as possible. I recommend that you cut
off ties with them forever, or they will drive you crazy."


I'm relieved.


"I recommend that you see one of the counselors in my practice
weekly, until your move can be arranged, and I'm writing you a prescription
for Mellaril, for anxiety."


Again, I tear up the prescription. Now that I, too, am the mother
of four, I fear that I'm becoming more and more like Mom. I refuse
to take a chemical just to get through the day, but I do schedule an
appointment with a counselor.


Peter and I sit in front of the TV that evening, after tucking the
girls into their beds. "I don't get it, Cath," he says, turning to look me
in the eye. "I just don't see where a psychiatrist gets off actually prescribing
a cutoff from a person's own mother and father."

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My stomach is in knots. "He was very intense while I told him
stories about them. His face flushed. I got the feeling that he doesn't
hear stories like mine often."


"I just don't know," Peter adds. "Let's not rush into anything.
Besides, orchestrating a move would come at great expense."


"I know. That concerns me, too," I reply.


"Let's take it day by day, Cath," Peter concludes, wrapping his
arm around me as I rest my head on his shoulder.


Moments later, I hear clicking noises coming from the hallway,
just outside the door of our little TV room. I get on my hands and
knees, crawl to the door, and peek around into the hallway. There
sits three-year-old Annie in her footed pajamas, big brown eyes peering
at me below the bangs of her short, straight, freshly shampooed
blonde hair. She giggles, arms full of books, hands grasping Fisher-Price
figures from Claire's dollhouse. I giggle back and swoop her
into my arms.


"So, you want some time alone with your mommy and daddy, do
you? Well, I think we can arrange that!"


<i>The next day we're in the front yard playing races with the</i>
older three girls, when Mom and Dad swerve into the driveway in
what Peter has dubbed their pimp car: a big white 1974 Cadillac
with a red vinyl interior. Dad, laughing, gets out of the driver's seat
and approaches me. He's wearing a thirty-year-old plaid sports jacket,
khaki slacks, brown alligator belt, and Nikes. Greeting me with
speech so rapid that spit sprays from his mouth, he gets closer to me.
He reeks of alcohol. My chest tightens as he grabs my shoulder and
kisses my cheek.


Meanwhile, Mom wobbles toward Annie, a lit cigarette in one
hand, open purse in the other, out of which pours lipstick, a compact,
an open package of cigarettes, bits of tobacco, Kleenex, wadded up
with a few dollar bills. "Come here, dear... come see Grandma," she
says to Annie, who runs to my side and rests her head against my leg.

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Don't you dare come near her," I say, "and you either, Dad...
both of you... stay away from my kids... you shouldn't even be
driving... you're drunk!"


"We just came by to see the baby, Cath, dear. We won't bother
anybody."


"Take the kids inside, Cath," Peter intervenes, extending his arm
to block my father. "I'll deal with this."


<i>That night Peter initiates a reconsideration of our move</i>.
He is now in 100 percent agreement with the psychiatrist's recommendation.
We decide on Auburn, the lovely college town that is both
home of Auburn University and central to Peter's east Alabama sales
territory. We sell our house, and I decide to wait until moving day to
tell my parents we're leaving.


After the movers pack our belongings and head for Auburn,
Peter and I herd the girls into the station wagon and drive, unannounced,
to Mom and Dad's. Peter waits in the car with the kids
while I ring the doorbell. This time, Dad answers the door and
invites me in. His gray hair is combed but needs a good shampooing;
he's pale, which accentuates the brown aging spots on his
face. The squared nails on his stubby fingers have yellowed. Mom
slouches over the arm of her soiled wing-back chair in one of his old
shirts, sleeves rolled up, smoking a Lark--she had switched brands
to mine when I started smoking in college. The squished cigarette-pack
wrapper is on her lap. Their trashed home smells like a smoke-filled
barroom. There are piles of magazines stacked all over, open
and unopened cartons, stacks of pictures and antique tables strewn
about. I don't know how they get through the day without tripping
over something.


I'm afraid I'll have a full-blown panic attack right in front of
them, but I muster the courage to sit on the edge of an armchair
near the door while my father, still standing, positions himself behind
Mom.

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"To what do we owe this glorious occasion, Catherine dear?" he
asks in a deep voice, the voice I'd learned to be terrified of as a child--
the voice of depression, the voice of anger.


"I've been seeing a psychiatrist," I reply, looking him in the eye. "I
had a major panic attack a couple of months ago, and I'm still struggling
with anxiety. The psychiatrist recommended that I break ties
with you and move away."


My heart skips beats while I speak. I fight images in my mind
of paramedics reviving me on their living room floor. Yet I'm able to
continue. "Peter and I have sold our house and we're moving with the
kids this afternoon to a town about an hour away. They're all outside
in the car waiting for me. Please don't contact us."


"Why of course, dear," Dad responds. "By all means, do what's
best for <i>you</i> and your family. We would <i>never</i> interfere. In fact, I have
no idea how we've interfered, but I certainly hope you have. That is,
if you're not too crazy, sweetheart. After all, you <i>are</i> seeing a psychiatrist
now."


Mom sways in her seat, repeating the same slobbering words over
and over. "Oh, really, Cath?... Oh, really, Cath?... Oh, really,
Cath?" She waves at me and, drooling, smiles, showing her cigarette-stained
teeth.


I stand, say goodbye, and walk out the door. A weight lifts from
my chest. I take a deep breath, and look up at the sky as once again
I leave my parents behind and drive away with my family. But a lingering
guilt begins, and haunts me all the way to Auburn. Although
I believe we are doing the right thing, I also feel that I am abandoning
them.
