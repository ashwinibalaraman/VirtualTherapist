I guess you have time to think in any hospital. In a mental
hospital you have far too much time to think. Most of us
neurotics do far too much introspection anyhow. Certainly
I was no exception. I tried to penetrate the "blooming, buzzing"
confusion of my own swirling, convoluted feelings and
impulses and thoughts and fragments of feelings. With predictable
and repetitive consistency my mind turned to my
feelings. "Are you happy or sad, elated or depressed, excited
or afraid, anxious or serene, joyful or despairing?" "Are you
all of these things?" To me, feeling was synonymous with
life. So I thought a lot in those weeks and months in the
hospital about my own feelings.


It's difficult to talk about feelings and emotions. Noncognitive
aspects of behavior have been conceded to the artists,
the philosophers, and the poets for study and explanation.
Such professionals as psychologists and psychiatrists, supposedly
concerned with human behavior, have done little to
help us understand emotional life emotionally. We know
something about it intellectually. <i>Feeling</i> really is the essence
of life, not <i>knowing</i>. If discussed at all, emotions are described

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When one is compelled to deal only with behavioral manifestations,
much of the meaning of human events is lost.
I think of myself lying there in that hospital bed that first
night. Behavioral description: "rapid pulse, hyperventilation,
rigid musculature, easily startled," and so on through
the minutiae of all possible physical observations. But you
and I know now how little that tells of the man whom I
have described on this important night.


Observations such as this, without the tempering of feelings
as the acknowledged essence of the human experience,
are of limited value only. For instance, one crucial dynamic
sign of the disorder termed schizophrenia is blunting or
dulling of affect. By this psychologists mean that the patient
presents a rather bland, unconcerned countenance and
in discussion he seemingly has little interest or involvement
in surrounding events. He seems detached and uninvolved.
This kind of description and interpretation is of limited help
and offers little aid in understanding what is important in
this condition.

Let me try to explain it this way. The sufferer is so overwhelmed
with sporadic waves of psychic pain that his attention
and efforts are consumed in girding his being to cope
with the next onslaught. In spite of the intentions of the
sufferer, something inside him demands that the next wave
of pain be met and the struggle for survival be renewed.
Under these circumstances, what do you expect? Feeling is
blunted, but only toward those outside events which are of
limited importance to the sufferer. Oh, that all feelings were
blunted! Mental patients with some insight and a measure
of psychological knowledge find the solemn diagnostic
blunting "sign" amusing. That is, they find the interpretation
amusing. The blunting and dulling of affect and the
seeming internal preoccupation are the results of violent,
virulent feelings that are lashing about uncontrollably inside.


Did you ever try going to a party with a severe toothache?
If you have, you have some small notion of what it's like
for the seriously emotionally disturbed. He has little energy
available with which to appear interested, amused, concerned,
or involved.


<b>The cowardly ones</b>


Someone once said that the bravest people in the world
are neurotics. I think that this is true of everyone who
suffers some serious and chronic emotional turmoil. The
vivid imagery and lush fantasy life of the sufferer would, I
am sure, stagger the comprehension of our "normal" brothers.


The sufferer conjures up a monster in the midst of paradise,
thirst in an oasis, death in the birth of life. He spends
many of his waking and most of his sleeping minutes in a
disquieting struggle with bad luck, illness, natural and manmade

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then the sufferer has to do double, no, triple duty. He has
to cope with life just as you do: real life with its problems
and joys, with its sorrows and despairs, with its bills and car
repairs and wrong numbers. But he also has to struggle with
the problems that his mind conjures up by day and with the
monsters that his subconscious spews out by night. Yet in
spite of this enormous expenditure of energy, he is often a
compassionate and understanding friend and frequently a
prodigious worker. I suspect some administrators look for
the most compulsive nut they can find for some of the really
"dirty" jobs that have to be done at the office or the clinic
or in the stockroom. This sufferer may have the kind of
compassion that makes him of use to his fellows. Kierkegaard
describes it this way:
<blockquote>
<p>
Compassion is so far from being an advantage to the sufferer
that rather by it one is only protecting one's own egotism.
One dare not in a deeper sense think of such trouble,
and so one spares oneself by compassion. Only when the
compassionate person is so related by his compassion to the
sufferer that in the strictest sense he comprehends that it is
his own cause which is here in question, only when he
knows how to identify himself in such a way with the
sufferer that when he is fighting for an explanation he is
fighting for himself, renouncing all thoughtlessness, softness,
and cowardice, only then does compassion acquire significance,
and only then does it perhaps find a meaning, since
the compassionate man differs from the sufferer for the fact
that he suffers in a higher form.

Now I think we have some sense of the compassionate in

and only then does it perhaps find a meaning, since
the compassionate man differs from the sufferer for the fact
that he suffers in a higher form.

The sufferer may become compassionate if his search for
humanness is fruitful. But while he searches he suffers exceedingly.
He sometimes gets up in the morning when a
man of lesser courage would lie there moaning. He works at
his job with only half the mental and physical resources
that are available to the "free" man. The rest of him is
busy--busy battling the terrors his mind spawns. He smiles
when a cry would be more appropriate. He volunteers for
extra work because he must not doubt himself and his
worth (or worse still, have you doubt him). He tries to
control strong, unreasonable feelings, unwanted anger, unknown
fears.


Sometimes his body lets him down. His stomach may
spew its contents. His bronchial tubes constrict, making
breathing difficult. Veins in his skull constrict and his head
throbs. His intestines writhe and his bowels rebel. His skin
may erupt or his ears ring. His hands may become unsteady.
His heart races or skips or sickeningly thuds. But he learns
to cope. To do so requires another exceedingly difficult series
of adaptations. Drugs, rigid schedules, denied pleasures,
protection from noxious circumstances and tasks (which
become so frequent and numerous that they are hard to
avoid)--all of these devices are used and sometimes, almost
always, they eventually fail. In spite of the ingenious devices
that the sufferer manages to use, the all-pervasive
emotion we call anxiety is still lurking somewhere, waiting
for a renewed chance to attack.


Many books have been written about this emotion. Many
dramas, fictional and real, have revolved around it. Concepts
of life have attributed to it a generic, motivating force.
Attempts to deny its power are continuous. But anxiety
remains the king of the jungle of destructive emotions.

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Kierkegaard described it definitively in <i>The Concept of Dread</i>.
He uses the word <i>Angst</i>, which is roughly comparable to the
psychological terms, free-floating anxiety and existential
anxiety. His translators use the word dread.


Dread is the possibility of freedom. Only this dread by
the aid of faith is absolutely educative, consuming as it does
all finite aims and discovering all their deceptions. And no
Grand Inquisitor has in readiness such terrible tortures as has
dread, and no spy knows how to attack more artfully the
man he suspects, choosing the instant when he is weakest,
nor knows how to lay traps where he will be caught and
ensnared, as dread knows how, and no sharp-witted judge
knows how to interrogate, to examine the accused, as dread
does, which never lets him escape, neither by diversion nor
by noise, neither at work nor at play, neither by day nor by
night.


This Grand Inquisitor, so well described by Kierkegaard,
is always on duty, always ready to renew the interrogation.
And not only can the sufferer not escape continuous confrontation
with him, he can rarely convince himself that
he will ever find respite.


<b>In the world afraid</b>


And where does dread or anxiety come from? Do some of
us just naturally have more of it than others? Are some of
us destined by our fate to have so much of it that we cannot
live?


Anxiety is the common denominator of emotional distress
and disorder of all kinds. Happy, comfortable people
don't just "go crazy." Crazy people have literally been
"driven crazy." They have come to a point in their lives
when they can no longer contain or control the rampant

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emotionally disturbed people are threatened people.
They react to fear and threat with rage, hostility, and aggression.
Since these noxious feelings are rejected by the
conscious minds of most of us, they are repressed. Repressed
emotions must emerge in some form; and for some
unknown reason, attributing our own feelings, motives, and
ideas to someone else when they are unacceptable to us is
a common human behavior.


So if my life has been dominated by fear, or if I believe
it has, then I will react with feelings of rage, frustration, and
despair. Since I cannot accept that I feel this way about
others, I make a simple shift in emotional logic and "give"
these feelings to others. Now it is they who are filled with
hate and venom. The circle of psychological logic is complete.
The formulation thus becomes: "People around me
are hateful and cold. They have no love or even tolerance for
me. They are resentful and impatient with me. Nobody is
willing to help me; if I fall down, I'll be stepped on. If I'm
starving, nobody will feed me; and if I hurt, nobody will
comfort me."


Of course it follows logically that if I see this kind of
world with these kinds of malevolent people in it, I'm crazy
if I'm not crazy. Who wouldn't be afraid in this jungle? And
this is the way the emotionally disturbed person feels about

But what is this trauma that we speak of? What is it, and
where does it happen? I will discuss this more completely
later.


<b>Learning and feeling</b>


John Rosen in his book, <i>Direct Psychoanalysis</i>, says that
there are two ways to reach maturity. The first, according to
him, is by "divine grace." By that he means that we can
grow to be emotionally mature if we are nurtured by parents
who themselves have attained secure adult status because
their needs were met in their growing. Such persons also
have the good fortune to have had a secure childhood life
and to have escaped such misfortunes as parental desertion,
death, divorce, or economic deprivation. These fortunate
people have had a good school experience and sound physical
health, and have been spared life's capricious calamities
such as accident, war, or hereditary disorders. In short, some
lucky people reach the stage of adult emotional and psychological
maturity because they had stable, mature parents,
and were afforded a secure, need-fulfilling childhood.


Many of us were not similarly smiled on by the gods. We
were not given what we needed to make the passage
through our developing years a smooth and pleasing journey.

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Unlike the recipients of "divine grace," who grow to be
loving and free people, life's victims have a much more
difficult time in reaching a satisfying level of emotional and
psychological maturity. Many never reach anything like a
satisfactory adjustment to their needs and life's demands.


What can we do for ourselves if we are among the unfortunate
ones? Does this mean that a disturbed childhood and
unfulfilled needs doom us to live miserably and to pass this
regrettable, tragic legacy on to our own children? Rosen says
that there is another way to reach maturity: through psychoanalysis.


Now I am certain that many would quarrel with Rosen
that psychoanalysis is essential for the repair of the damaged
personality. It would probably be more acceptable to
say that people with problems of arrested personality development
must struggle to obtain the comfort and growth
that come naturally to others. The fashion in which this
struggle is engaged may indeed take the form of psychoanalysis.
But it may not.


Psychoanalysis can provide me with a meaningful way to
see myself and to understand what forces are acting on me.
The supposition is that when I see myself realistically and
understand why I behave as I do, I am able to change what
I do and abandon old, destructive ways of behaving. However,

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to "see" oneself,
for oneself, by oneself. We cannot see our own resistances,
blind spots, and rationalizations. If we could, we
wouldn't be disturbed and unhappy. We would have long
ago cured ourselves. No, it is necessary to have someone
who can help us in a firm but sympathetic way. Those who
help us must be sympathetic to earn our trust and confidence
and must be able to understand how we hoodwink
ourselves in order to maintain our precarious balance, and
they must be firm in the face of our self-directed lies and
our desperate attempts to cover up and retrench. Above all,
they must be patient and know with an understanding that
comes from personal experience that we are compelled, that
we must resist and retract, and evade and deny. In the face
of these tactics, the good therapist helps us to carve out
small steps along our way and to accept the fact that
progress toward maturity is a slow, painful, and erratic journey.


Carl Rogers in his paper, <i>Learning to be Free</i>, characterizes
this process as a groping toward freedom and maturity. He
says, "The client moves gradually toward a new type of
realization, a dawning recognition that in some sense he
chooses himself. This is not usually any sudden burst of
insight--it is a groping, ambivalent, confused and uncertain
movement into a new territory."

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Rogers goes on to explain that although it may be true
that we are products of our past, we do not have to remain
history's prisoners. We can change life's circumstances and
use our strength to become what we would be. We can
become persons who choose rather than robots who react.
But first it is necessary for us to finally realize that in our
misery we are truly driven, that we are not making choices
but living in duplicity and anxious deceit. When we can
really see that we are driven by internal forces and external
pressures and are not really free to make our own decisions
and choices, then we are finally ready to begin the struggle
toward self-direction and growth.


My treatment in the hospital certainly has not led me to
these conclusions about learning to feel and to be free.
However, the experience of learning the remorse and agony
of not being free has taught me something. My freedom was
not extended by the hospital stay or anything that happened
there. But my compassion and empathy for the suffering of others were.
