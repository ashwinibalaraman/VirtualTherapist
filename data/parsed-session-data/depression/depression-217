BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> To condense down, [PATIENT NAME] has had difficult periods, difficult number of, two years, he was drinking heavily at one time and has had two suicide attempts and two hospitalizations in the past year.  The first he doesn't remember because of blackout, the second he took an overdose of Xanax.  He was treated at a place call the [DEIDENTIFIED], was diagnosed as being bipolar disorder, and treated with Risperdal, Depakote, Trazodone, and Effexor.  This left him drowsy and with an uncontrollable appetite from the Seroquel.  He left that facility on Effexor and Trazodone, went down to [DEIDENTIFIED] to a program there, found out the program was run by a group of scientologists who took his Effexor and Trazodone away and he's come back here for treatment.  He lives in [DEIDENTIFIED] and has lived in the [DEIDENTIFIED] prior to that.  These two events happened first with the death of his mother two years ago which triggered him into a depression and increased drinking and then one year ago his wife who was Russian, committed suicide after she gave birth to their child.  The suspicion is that she had post partum depression which was never treated and she finally killed herself.  How did she do that?
<b>PT:</b> She took some muscle relaxers.
<b>DR:</b> She took muscle relaxers.  Well, let's see, one of the things I do is I get the patient to fill out a very extensive questionnaire about family history and all sort of other things, medical history, allergies and I have a symptom check list that they do.  And to me, at the present time, he has a symptom complex which is very compatible with bipolar disorder.  Looking at the questionnaire, looking at his answers to the following questions such as my brain never shuts off, I think about the same thing over and over without coming to any conclusion, my thoughts go so fast I can't keep up with them when I talk.  He loses his train of thought, that has to do with distractibility.  He feels on guard which has to do with action of fight or flight response.  He has problems focusing and concentrating, staying on task.  He has symptoms of a post traumatic stress disorder also.  He has emotional numbing.  He has trouble responding emotionally and physically during sex.  He feels empty inside.  He feels sad, has low energy, has the major depressive ache in his chest.  He loses control of his temper.  He has frequent [INAUDIBLE] nowhere.  He has bruxism.  He also has restless leg syndrome and this is off medications.  He finds himself shaking one or both legs when he sits still.  This has to do with the acuesthesia that sometimes is with bipolar disorder.  He checks that he has a hard time sitting still.  I actually give people the mood question, the mood disorders questionnaire and he scored 4 of that but that was significant in that he feels irritable, [INAUDIBLE] at people, starting fights or arguments, that thoughts race though his head, he's distractible.  He was diagnosed with ADD as a child and he still has symptoms like that.  He was referred here to the practice by [NAME OTHER] who is his cousin.  He's a high school graduate.  He works at [DEIDENTIFIED].  He's not drinking, right?  Are you attending AA?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> He's not attending AA, that's a bummer.  I have no history of [NAME OTHER].  Wife with suicide, medical history, [INAUDIBLE], okay.  And you live at, where do you live, do you live at home?
<b>PT:</b> I'm living in [DEIDENTIFIED] right now.  I still have a condo in [DEIDENTIFIED] and debating whether I'm going back to [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay, who do you live with?
<b>PT:</b> My grandmother.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, is that okay for you?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Where is the child?
<b>PT:</b> In Russia.
<b>DR:</b> The child went back to Russia?
<b>PT:</b> He went with her parents back to Russia.
<b>DR:</b> Is that okay with you?
<b>PT:</b> Is that okay with me?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> A little bit.  The fact that I don't get to see him is the biggest but what we're doing is, we're going to get him dual citizenship.  He gets his Russia citizenship and everywhere but that will not eliminate his US citizenship so he can travel back and forth.
<b>DR:</b> Why did you decide to do that?
<b>PT:</b> Well, my mother being gone and my father is in prison, my grandmother is 72, 73 years old, I don't have anybody and the mental state that I'm in - 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> The stability of both her mother and her father are still together and have good jobs, I mean the whole, there's a list of things.
<b>DR:</b> I've got you, I understand.
<b>PT:</b> My family wanted me to put him up for adoption.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I said there's no way of that.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Bummer, what's your dad in prison for?
<b>PT:</b> Violation of probation.  You know my father.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's another thing that's caused depression all my life too, as well, is him as well. 
<b>DR:</b> Is he bipolar too?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so right now, if I'm reading this thing right, you've got a combination of anxiety and depression and sadness and probably a whole bunch of stuff that's sort of floating through your head that you'd like to get, that you can't resolve and some residual losses from everything just falling apart around you.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And you probably miss a lot of people.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, how about suicide to you now?
<b>PT:</b> I mean since just trying to commit suicide about a month and a half ago, it kind of really opened some doors up for me, it kind of, it was going to kill me but then again it saved my life.  I know that I need some help now.  I'm trying to get it in a couple of different ways but some things didn't kind of work out being the psychiatrist, you know that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But I know now that I need to be on medication.  I've been prescribed medication in the past but just not taken them.
<b>DR:</b> What have you been on?
<b>PT:</b> Well, just the Adderall and like a year ago when I took the Adderall and Risperdal and the Seroquel and Depakote.  I hated taking all of those.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I stopped within a month and a half of taking those because it just made me so out of my mind.
<b>DR:</b> I got you on that.
<b>PT:</b> I know I need to be on something, I just don't want it to take away from my personality that I do have.
<b>DR:</b> I understand that.  You have a good personality.  
<b>PT:</b> I think one of my biggest things is not sleeping at night.  I know that's a lot of about being depressed and stuff but - 
<b>DR:</b> And bipolar.
<b>PT:</b> Huh.
<b>DR:</b> And bipolar.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Hello, uh-huh, yeah, they supposedly did it yesterday.  You haven't picked it up, if you want to call them and tell them what you need.  Okay, bye.  Excuse me.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> That's my answering service.  I've got somebody in crisis so that was - 
<b>PT:</b> Basically when I'm laying in bed at night and this happens all through the day too but the only thing I think about is the day my wife committed suicide, that's all that's running through my mind and then just past experiences, you know, whether it be good or bad, that really keeps me from sleeping and there was a time right before I committed to suicide to where I would just, and it went on for about two months, I would just start crying, just out of the day, just I would be at my desk doing paperwork and I'd have to get up and go to the bathroom because I couldn't control my crying.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.  Okay, who found her?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I did.
<b>DR:</b> You found her.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  She did it, we had just had an argument and I had said that I wanted a divorce and she went to the bathroom and took a whole bunch of pills and, you know, I had knocked on the door a couple times and she said she was okay and I though maybe she was just in there crying or what not and I was on the phone with my grandmother and she finally opened the door and she opened the door and she just fell on the floor and started seizuring, so I called the ambulance and when they got there she was already - 
<b>DR:</b> Dead?
<b>PT:</b> Well, she was not breathing.  She was in the hospital for about a week and a half but she had suffered so much brain damage that they said she would never recover, she would always just be like that and then her family from Russia came over.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  
<b>PT:</b> I mean it's so bad I can't even, I can't have a decent, I can't even have a conversation, you know, just a friendly conversation with another female.  I don't even want to, it like disgusts me so bad, you know, the only people, the only females that I can talk to is within my family.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right, did the Effexor work for you?
<b>PT:</b> I didn't take it long enough.  It was only for about a week and a half but the Trazodone, they said it was an antidepressant too is what the guy had told me - 
<b>DR:</b> It is an antidepressant.
<b>PT:</b> And it made me feel better through the day because I was in that place for about five days and I had it on me the first day after I got pissed off at them.  The first night I didn't sleep to well on it but then the second night he raised it up a little bit.  I think he had it at 150 maybe.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I was on 150 of Effexor too, so - 
<b>DR:</b> So you don't know which one was raising your mood.
<b>PT:</b> I probably guarantee you it would be the Trazodone, I mean I don't know though, I'm not too sure but I did sleep all the way through the night though on it.
<b>DR:</b> That would help.  People who are bipolar - 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Often times will have a real rapid response to antidepressants.
<b>PT:</b> Oh wow.
<b>DR:</b> And sometimes they even, they'll even switch into mania which is the danger.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But there's often that real rapid response with it but then sleeping would help too, getting your days and nights back on track.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And you've been called ADD as a kid?
<b>PT:</b> I was on Ritalin from probably 12 to 16 and I stopped taking it at 16.
<b>DR:</b> What did it do?
<b>PT:</b> What did it do for me?  It gave me headaches and made me not want to eat, curbed my appetite really bad which, that's probably what I could use now but
<b>DR:</b> Did it do anything for you?
<b>PT:</b> I'll tell you, I have no idea, I really don't know, it was, then my family said it did but I really couldn't tell the difference.
<b>DR:</b> You couldn't tell the difference?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right, you've got insurance?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, okay, okay, so I was going to call you something, we'll probably call you a mixed bipolar disorder with symptoms of anxiety and depression, anxiety, depression, and agitation and insomnia and attention deficit disorder, not really attention deficit disorder but distractibility.  Bipolar disorder and ADD often times are -
<b>PT:</b> Close.
<b>DR:</b> Well they're close but they also, they even overlap sometimes but they're also, one is misdiagnosed with the other.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Alcoholism is very much a major depressive disorder which mixes all in with this stuff.  Stress, deaths of wife, death of grandmother, separation of son, [INAUDIBLE] of your life.
<b>PT:</b> Not death of grandmother.
<b>DR:</b> Death of mother?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, moderate symptoms, okay.  Tell you what we'll do, let's do the Trazodone because that's working for you.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Let's start on Effexor.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Do that too.  Did the Risperdal help you?
<b>PT:</b> I was on so many combinations of medicine it was - 
<b>DR:</b> Do you remember how much you were taking?
<b>PT:</b> No, I have no idea.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Risperdal is a pretty good drug for getting things fixed right now, okay, but if you, I'm not sure which is causing you the most problems, the Risperdal or the Seroquel. 
<b>PT:</b> Seroquel caused me some problems at night, it just made me want to, I mean it knocked me out.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But like I said, it made me eat and eat and eat and eat.
<b>DR:</b> Excitement, excitement, excitement.  Who are some of your cousins?
<b>PT:</b> What did you say?
<b>DR:</b> Who are some of your cousins?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER]
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  What else, who else is kin to you guys?  How does the family work, what other names in your family?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], it's just all on my dad's side, now on my mom's side - 
<b>DR:</b> Your mom's side is - 
<b>PT:</b> I have my grandmother [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], that's my grandmother but he's not my real grandfather.
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] is not kin to you guys?
<b>PT:</b> Who?
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER], okay, different one, okay.  So I'm going to give you some Trazodone 150, you better not take it all at once, it might knock you out, just try maybe to do 50 and then 75 and 100 and just take enough to make you sleep the first night and then if you need to go up, go up.  I'll give you some 100 mg tablets.  I going to give you 75 of Effexor and take one of those.  You might want to take it with food, it can sometimes make you nauseated at first, I don't know if you had that experience or not.
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I'm also going to give you some Risperdal but a real small dose, about a half a mg and that usually does not cause any major problems, it just sort of takes the edge off a little bit and slows your brain down and takes the irritability out.  You take that at night and that will also help you to sort of settle in.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, so take it along with the - 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, we're going to give you a bunch of stuff.  You might want to take the Effexor during the daytime and with food and then take the Risperdal and Trazodone at nighttime.  All right and the other one that I think might be helpful to you is Lamictal, that's a mood stabilizer, it's really an energy modulator.  You know, what you've got is just, like if somebody has hyperthyroidism, overactive thyroid, there thyroid is out of control and they just get wired from that, you've got a cellular energy problem, okay, and it's, what it acts like is it makes your fight or flight response turn wide open and when it does that, it activates other places also that shouldn't be regulated.  It messes up your ability to regulate your body to sleep and all sorts of other things and you've got some, it's hard to tell which is what because PTSD and bipolar disorder often times overlap a lot of times, especially if you've got sort of a mixed symptom like you do.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So it's a lot of things that are mixed in with that, like emotional numbing, that's part of being really on guard kind of phase and it also starts, it over activates your brain and you can actually sort of hear, feel and hear and sense all the normal activation of your brain but it's not under the surface anymore, it's just going on like that all the time.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then you've got a whole bunch of memories that can't get finished.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> They just keep being replayed and replayed and replayed and replayed and a lot of reliving of stuff.
<b>PT:</b> A lot of that is blaming myself too.
<b>DR:</b> Sure, I understand that, I understand that but if you do that, you've got to blame the illness which makes people mean as hell and makes them not have good judgement and makes them say things they wouldn't say normally when they get really teed off and if you mix alcohol in on top of it, you can really get a devils mixture because then you've got loss of control, loss of, loss of good sense and then you get the same thing with a hangover as you can with intoxication. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But this will help you sort of, this will help the process and it's called Lamictal, it's an anticonvulsant or mood stabilizer, it's used for lots of things.  It's used for bipolar disorder, it's used for seizure disorders, it helps restless leg syndrome, it'll help that too, it'll help bruxism, it'll help Raynaud's, do you have cold hands and cold feet?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> You do.
<b>PT:</b> Cold feet?
<b>DR:</b> Cold feet.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> How about migraine headaches?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> One sided headaches or do you ever have things like sparking lights or anything like that?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Or a feeling of a headache, no, okay, this also helps migraines too in bipolar people.  It helps with sensory overload, you know, like noises get to you and smells get to you, things like that, it'll help focus and concentration too because it stops the fight or flight response, it cuts it down, it does it slowly, it won't happen all at once but it'll gradually slow down and what you have to do with it is to go slowly with it, like 25 mg once a day for two weeks and then 50 mg once a day for two weeks and then you can go up to 50 or go up to 100 and it's going to take anywhere from about 100 to 200 mg in the average person to stabilize them.  The whole process lasts about three weeks, okay, so what you'll feel is like a gradual slowing down and as that happens, you'll sleep better, your anxiety will get better, your downloading of memories will get better, all those sorts of things.  Now the thing you've got to watch out for is it can cause rashes in people and there's a debate about what percentage of people have rashes.  I don't think it's that much, probably about 3-5% of people will have it.  It's a real small rash that starts off that looks like poison ivy or poison oak with red dots on it and it'll get better.  You can sort of a diffuse rash.  You can actually get localized rashes.
<b>PT:</b> Like eczema, because I have eczema.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, you have eczema?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Well this would be like, like small dots on your skin all over the place, I've seen that happen but most of it is like poison ivy, just like itching and burning kind of stuff, little red dots that come together and then they'll get sort of a raised area, sometimes they have blisters but if you get any kind of rash that gets worse, okay, any kind of angry looking rash that gets worse, then you need to stop it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> When they first used the drug in '94, they used too much of it and they used it on top of a drug called Depakote which you took before, which the two compete for metabolism so if you're giving somebody 2000 or 3000 mg a Depakote and they dumped on 300 mg of Trileptal, they just would get toxic levels of Trileptal, Lamictal and actually, double it, so it would be about 600 mg immediately and what happened with that, they had some called Johnson's syndrome which is really a bad rash but they had a problem that they couldn't drop the dosage of anything because they might precipitate seizures.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And then the Lamictal just sort of stayed in the body because they had such a high level, you know, so it created a problem, some of the people died but since that time and of course that was years and years ago, but since you've been going slowly, 25, 50, and 100, there's not been really any kind of major problems with that, because if you stop it, it goes away and I'm sure somebody's had some problems but I've not heard of it and I've not seen any myself, okay, and I think it's one of the better ones because it doesn't mess up your thinking as long as you stay with it.  If you get too high of a dose, it'll mess up your memory a little bit but as long as you stay within range, it works, it doesn't make you gain weight, it doesn't make you lose weight, it doesn't interfere with your thinking or your memory, it's just a very clean drug, you know, and if you can take it, it's probably the best one, it has really good effectiveness and really good efficacy, effectiveness I guess you call it but again it takes a while to get up the dosage.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> We just gradually go up, gradually.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> Have you been to any AA meetings?
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't want to go.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, why?
<b>PT:</b> They depress me more than anything in the world.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I don't like to hear people sitting around talking about war stories, you know, I'm having a hard time dealing with my own problems and I'm going to tell you, to be honest with you, I know I drink a lot.
<b>DR:</b> You're still drinking?
<b>PT:</b> No, I haven't drank in a month and a half.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> My grandmother would send me on my way back to [DEIDENTIFIED] if she caught me drinking.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> And honestly, I haven't wanted to drink.  I feel, I hate to say this but I feel like, you know, when I'm at my grandmother's house, I'm in a safe zone, you know what I'm saying.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Plus my cousin comes over and visits me a lot and helps me out and gets me up and out of my moods that I get in.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> But I don't want, I don't have the urge to drink anymore.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I feel so terrible all the time.
<b>DR:</b> All right, I understand.
<b>PT:</b> I feel that if I get on some medication and it works, I don't need to drink, it's not going to be there.
<b>DR:</b> We're going to, okay, I really think that you've got, among everything else, you qualify for post traumatic stress disorder too and at some point in time, we're going to need to revisit therapy about that, psychotherapy or something like that, right now, I think it would just create more problems to stir up the pot right now, so I don't think it's a good idea until you stabilize out.  So we'll wait a little bit on that until you're more stable. 
<b>PT:</b> Are you talking about going back and revisiting that day?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and all that kind of stuff.
<b>PT:</b> I revisit that day every night.
<b>DR:</b> I know, in therapy though.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> We'll wait a little bit on that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  And there we are.
<b>PT:</b> All righty.
<b>DR:</b> Call me if you feel suicidal.
<b>PT:</b> I will. 
<b>DR:</b> Anything happens, okay, I've got an answering machine which is, I've got an emergency service and that's, let me give you a copy of that, I don't have a card here, this is the number of the emergency services.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And you can call the [DEIDENTIFIED] too if you need to.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And that'll put you in touch with them.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, I'm ready to go.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you [PHYSICIAN NAME]
<b>DR:</b> Yes sir.
