BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Um, how are you?
<b>PT:</b> I'm fine. I think.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, now let's belabor that. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I saw you on March 15th you were describing getting disoriented most mornings, your mood was low, you weren't essentially sad or anxious but you were frustrated with your cognitive problems, demoralized. Um, feeling like mostly a loner, appetite was super fine, your energy was okay. We didn't make any changes to the Paxil?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Provigil, Ativan combination.
<b>PT:</b> I don't even want to touch that.
<b>DR:</b> Well, we haven't talked yet, but I'll take you're, uh, interest into consideration as we uh make our decisions here. Um in these two months, how has your mood been? 
<b>PT:</b> Been down um.
<b>DR:</b> Unstable?
<b>PT:</b> Well no, I uh.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sad most of the time?
<b>PT:</b> No not really.
<b>DR:</b> So your mood's okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> When I'm with my daughter or my son, my mood is not okay.
<b>DR:</b> What's wrong with it then?
<b>PT:</b> I can't seem to verbalize. I can't seem to speak.
<b>DR:</b> Can't find words?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you have some cognitive problems?
<b>PT:</b> Well is that cognitive or is it just?
<b>DR:</b> Well do you have memory problems?
<b>PT:</b> No. I just don't know what to say to them, you know, I feel as though.
<b>DR:</b> Is it about something specific?
<b>PT:</b> Well.
<b>DR:</b> Well tell me a story.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Tell me a story.
<b>PT:</b> Once upon a time, um, it seems that, um, the fact that I lost all.
<b>DR:</b> That's not a story.
<b>PT:</b> I know, but that's the reason.
<b>DR:</b> I don't want a reason, I want a story. I was visiting my daughter, la, la, la, la, la.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I was visiting my daughter.
<b>PT:</b> All right, I was visiting my daughter and um we're talking and I couldn't understand why she was so cool to me and.
<b>DR:</b> When was this?
<b>PT:</b> About a month ago.
<b>DR:</b> And you were visi, you stayed over?
<b>PT:</b> It was 1 of those nightmare days on the bus.
<b>DR:</b> Okay so you got out there and started spending time with her?
<b>PT:</b> Right and uh.
<b>DR:</b> And you felt that she was being cool to you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, then what happened?
<b>PT:</b> I didn't go out on Saturday cause I had, I had [NAME OTHER]'s birthday party so I went to that instead of out to [NAME OTHER]'s, they had a fair in honor of the school. It was beautiful, really beautiful and so when I got out there she was busy with the children and [NAME OTHER], who's the grandmother was helping out and [NAME OTHER] sort of grabbed my arm and said come with me and look inside of the painting because I want to take you and the children to have pictures taken. So I spent very little time with [NAME OTHER], I bought her a necklace because I liked the necklace and I thought well it's a necklace, why'd you buy that for me.  Had I gone in and looked around then I would have seen something else, but you were there for so many days and this is the only thing that you mentioned to me, um, and then we went back to the house.  
<b>DR:</b> So she didn't really like the necklace?  
<b>PT:</b> No, she didn't really like it, she would like something else, she loved the necklace that I got so I wanted to exchange it with her, she wouldn't do that.
<b>DR:</b> Can she bring it back to the store and exchange?
<b>PT:</b> Of course she can but she won't. Um, and then somehow I did say something to her about you seem to be always angry with me or upset with me. She said that because I had lost all this money, if her father was alive he would of seen to it that they had money for the children's colleges. [NAME OTHER] goes to a private school now. She's gonna go until she starts high school. [NAME OTHER] is going to that school. Nobody gave us money for it. You know we managed to do it.  Uh and if he were here and you lost all that money, so it was, it was over and over again.
<b>DR:</b> I thought your husband lost most of the money. It was after, it was after?
<b>PT:</b> It was after um well he did lose, he lost money because we had to close the business and when we closed the business it was really a mess because of this, uh, client went out of business and that would have 
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]. But what you're saying is that she's holding this against you and this many years, it's a long grudge?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And so she was counting some money coming her way that's not coming her way and she's holding it against you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah right.
<b>DR:</b> And that's why she's mad at you now?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's why, that's why she's angry with me. She's trying not to be angry with me and I'm sort of caught in the middle. I have [NAME OTHER] to take care of and I'm still taking care of her, cause [NAME OTHER]'s angry with me for the same reason.
<b>DR:</b> For losing money?
<b>PT:</b> For losing money, for him not coming into the business, whatever it is, see this is where I'm indecisive, I don't realize that when I trust people, they're not necessarily the ones that I should trust.
<b>DR:</b> What are you talking about? Are you talking about losing the money?
<b>PT:</b> My accountant. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And the old business. 
<b>DR:</b> This was a while ago, this was years ago.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know and he chose not to come into, chose to if he came in I would leave, he would not send [NAME OTHER] any money, he would not give me any money
<b>DR:</b> Who would?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], I would just be gone and uh.
<b>DR:</b> He would take the business from you?
<b>PT:</b> Take the business.
<b>DR:</b> Not buy it?
<b>PT:</b> Not buy it and it, it's really confusing for me because.
<b>DR:</b> What's confusing?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I, uh, I couldn't imagine that he would be angry with me you know I couldn't imagine where his anger was coming from. I trusted the accountant and what he was telling me I believed and [NAME OTHER] kept telling me it wasn't true so I'm like up in the air. I'm up in the air.
<b>DR:</b> So [NAME OTHER] was right though?
<b>PT:</b> He was right, yeah he was right, but had I known he was right, I mean I didn't know my husband trusted this accountant, so I trusted what my husband trusted. It's silly, it's nonsense but it goes back awhile.
<b>DR:</b> It's like they're holding this against you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah they're holding it against me. They're holding it against me. So uh what can I tell you, we still get along but uh.
<b>DR:</b> But it's a real tension.
<b>PT:</b> It's tension.
<b>DR:</b> In the relationship. That's too bad.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah that's too bad.
<b>DR:</b> Strikes me as a little spoiled.
<b>PT:</b> It is.
<b>DR:</b> On their part.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you very much.
<b>DR:</b> I hate to but.
<b>PT:</b> I can say it, I can say it.
<b>DR:</b> Entitled.
<b>PT:</b> You know, who the heck are you that you're entitled you know, if your father lost all this money would you have been angry with him? Would he be the reason for your anger or you would have forgiven him so? Why are you holding against me? So.
<b>DR:</b> You know, I mean, it's not their money until you and your husband die.
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> So it's really your money you lost.
<b>PT:</b> Hey I'm not dead yet, but if I am you know they'll get it so. It's really um an unbelievable story because it hurts me you know, it really hurts me. Um.
<b>DR:</b> Luckily you're mature enough to not write things whether black or white kinda stroke and recognize that this may not be your son and daughter at their best.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But it's an aspect of them that you can, that can be painful for you and yet it doesn't mean the relationship is over, it means that you just should probably avoid the subject with them and move on.
<b>PT:</b> I have to move on with it, I just.
<b>DR:</b> There will be uncomfortable moments when things come up, but you just push it aside.
<b>PT:</b> I push it away, I have to forget it, let it go.
<b>DR:</b> Right, I would hope they would achieve that level of maturity also.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I can't help it if he's in business like our business. I can't help it if maybe [NAME OTHER] isn't doing as well or he isn't. I don't even know how he's doing. I don't know what they earn.
<b>DR:</b> Expenses are very high these days.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Schools
<b>PT:</b> Oh God, it's unbelievable.
<b>DR:</b> It really is. What kind of business were you in?
<b>PT:</b> Wholesale cork and provisions and cheeses and it was a wonderful business.
<b>DR:</b> Is that what [NAME OTHER]'s in?
<b>PT:</b> No [NAME OTHER] is in the insurance business.
<b>DR:</b> That's a good business.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah so now my [NAME OTHER] has left me.
<b>DR:</b> Who's [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] has left me. She was the woman who came in and took care and all this stuff and unfortunately she's having a problem, works for [INAUDIBLE] or 1 of them.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And he's getting too much, uh, pressure from the work that he was doing. He was going to Chicago and he was going here and going there and it caused him to go into so he took a lower payer job, she's working 5 days a week and she doesn't want to work for me anymore.  Meanwhile, I'm looking for somebody.
<b>DR:</b> To do what? To do bills and stuff?
<b>PT:</b> To do bills, I can't do them, I don't want to do them. I cannot.
<b>DR:</b> What kind of bills?
<b>PT:</b> Insurance, uh.
<b>DR:</b> The vast majority can be done automatically.
<b>PT:</b> But I want somebody to do them. I had somebody all these years, in family an accountant because I have to get rid of my accountant, it's $2000 a year for him, but that's when I was rich and famous.
<b>DR:</b> And still you're paying?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Wow, pretty pricey.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I'm getting rid of him and I'm going to another accountant that [NAME OTHER] found for me, he's in New Jersey, he's very nice and his wife uh is willing to come and do my bills. So thank you very much, I do not want his wife doing my bills for whatever reason. I don't need my life in their pocket. I don't need them.
<b>DR:</b> Let me ask my questions.
<b>PT:</b> Go ahead.
<b>DR:</b> Your appetite's okay?
<b>PT:</b> I don't remember to eat, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're losing weight?
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> You sleeping?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What's your energy level like?
<b>PT:</b> Well this morning, since I did go to a dance class last night and we stayed for 2 sets, I could not move this morning. Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I take the Paxil at night and I wake up in the morning and I'm just.
<b>DR:</b> Dragging. What time do you take it?
<b>PT:</b> I take it around 11:30.
<b>DR:</b> How many hours sleep do you get?
<b>PT:</b> Uh if I go to sleep around 12:00/12:15, I sleep till 8:00.
<b>DR:</b> Could you take the Paxil earlier?
<b>PT:</b> I could if I remember.
<b>DR:</b> Like around 8, 9 10?
<b>PT:</b> I could if I remembered.
<b>DR:</b> Try, try to. Just don't take a double dose, okay. Um no suicidal thinking?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No panic attacks?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You don't feel hopeless or helpless?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I was listening to a radio program this morning, a woman who was talking about ADD, attention deficit and all of a sudden I remembered I really do have attention deficit.
<b>DR:</b> Disorder, ADD, did you have it as a child though?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Good, you were daydreaming in school?
<b>PT:</b> I could not do, it was very hard with my mother to be a daydreamer. I couldn't do my work, uh, I'd come home to do my math and she'd stand there like hitting me because I couldn't do it.
<b>DR:</b> You couldn't stick with tasks?
<b>PT:</b> Couldn't stick with tasks. I could leave. I could.
<b>DR:</b> What were your grades like?
<b>PT:</b> Very low.
<b>DR:</b> Very low, they were lower than your intelligence?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> They could have been higher?
<b>PT:</b> Yes. Where in algebra when I finally was determined to study.
<b>DR:</b> Actually I diagnosed that before.
<b>PT:</b> When somebody gets me tickets I got to the ballet, I read, lots of smart people have ADD.
<b>DR:</b> That's right a lot of people do and they do beautifully with medication.  When I met you February 26th '03 we said that you're first diagnosis was major depression, second is panic attacks and third is ADD. You're a daydreamer, you didn't stick to things as a kid  -
<b>PT:</b> Right. 
<b>DR:</b> And the funny thing, got C's and D's in school.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Yep.
<b>DR:</b> You know to diagnose ADD you actually have to have it as a child. You're not allowed to get the diagnosis first in adulthood, so it sounds like you have a legitimate diagnosis and that's probably 1 of the reasons we've always gravitated towards stimulants with you. Right? We've always had you on something that juiced up your energy?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Those are the treatments for ADD. We've had you on Ritalin and we have you now on Provigil which is kind of a soft treatment for ADD.
<b>PT:</b> But it seems to work. It seems to get me out of the feeling of depression, you know of well.
<b>DR:</b> Fogginess?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah uh I keep, I seem to feel better when I take it. I mean I was total today. I really. I couldn't.
<b>DR:</b> Problem is you have some other cognitive dysfunction now, you have some other reason for not thinking clearly, you're having memory problems that's interacting with the ADD.
<b>PT:</b> Well the um I had 3 piles of clothing cause [NAME OTHER] came and moved the closets, 1 has to go to 1 cleaner, 1 has to go to another cleaner.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Plus the cost of it once it's done, you know, I'm sort of afraid to take them in.
<b>DR:</b> Why are you afraid to take them in?
<b>PT:</b> Well I, I, I think about the bill and I think about uh you know when the bill comes and how am I gonna pay it and.
<b>DR:</b> How much could it be?
<b>PT:</b> Oh God only knows, it's a lot, like $75/80 I don't know, I just, I can't.
<b>DR:</b> Why is something like this overwhelming?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I want to go away. Um, I want to go to Arizona whether it's hot or it's cold or it's miserable.  I want to, I just, I have, my whole theory seems to revolve around money. I know that [NAME OTHER] called you.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah. 
<b>PT:</b> I'm not going to see her anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Why not?
<b>PT:</b> I'm going back to [NAME OTHER.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good.
<b>PT:</b> I mean [NAME OTHER]
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER], I don't remember what we talked, she seemed to care very much about you.
<b>PT:</b> She was mentioned to me by a doctor and he said she does nutrition, she does this, she does that, so I figured well I'll go over. Started with [NAME OTHER], well she'll tell me to go to this group of women, uh, I looked up a group, there's nothing there for me. [NAME OTHER] will say to me try Kabahlah, I say sure, cause I'm sort of shy about going over to Kabahlah.
<b>DR:</b> Why? Just showing up?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> I don't know anything about it.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know anything about it either. 
<b>DR:</b> I know it's Jewish.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. That's about all we know.
<b>DR:</b> High level mysticism. I don't know what this modern Kabahlah religion, God only knows. Let's try to give you something to do, something to keep you busy, I don't know, well you won't find me doing that.  I'm just gonna try and keep your brain healthy the rest is your problem. Your life is your problem.
<b>PT:</b> My life is my problem.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah but we have to make sure that your brain is working to the best that it can.
<b>PT:</b> The only thing is it's flooded with this nonsense, I mean flooded with uh my son not getting along with his wife and being annoyed with me cause I can't give him any, I mean, he doesn't ask me for anything, but I know that that thought is there.
<b>DR:</b> Well you're a bit guilt driven. You have low self-esteem and you're.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know you're kind of a magnet for any.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um maybe some psychotherapy could help you with that.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe [NAME OTHER] could help me with that?
<b>DR:</b> She probably could, she's kind of a wise, wise person to guide you on issues like that.
<b>PT:</b> I uh.
<b>DR:</b> As far as your mood disorder though and I have seen you quite anxious and depressed and overwhelmed, you're in decent shape.
<b>PT:</b> I am.
<b>DR:</b> You're in decent shape and you're ADD, you know with the Provigil, you know the Provigil treats it some, it's decent. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah it's funny if I'm with people and they're talking about something I can come out with something that happened, uh, you know in history.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah so your distant memory is very good?
<b>PT:</b> Well, well yeah, you know the things they were searching for the name of a man or woman or whoever it was.
<b>DR:</b> It's probably the newer memories that are more problematic.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. I have no desire to call anyone, yet I feel a lack of company and uh I'm working at, uh, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You are?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Doing what?
<b>PT:</b> Believe it or not I'm in admitting.
<b>DR:</b> That sounds like fun.
<b>PT:</b> Which is joyous, I tell you. I tell you I don't feel so bad when the older people come in but when those kids come in ah, oh my God.
<b>DR:</b> We're not changing your Paxil dose.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> The Provigil dose we're not changing either.
<b>PT:</b> Cause when I took a lot of it I would feel this
<b>DR:</b> Right and that's, and for that reason also we're not putting you on a stronger stimulant cause those are more [INAUDIBLE]matic, those are more chance of giving you palpitations, or heart rate problems or blood pressure problems, so we're kind of stuck where we are.
<b>PT:</b> Well once they start.
<b>DR:</b> As long as your head stays above water. Things get worse, then we'll find something.
<b>PT:</b> We'll figure something out.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. Well your spirit seems okay, I mean.
<b>PT:</b> I have normal problems.
<b>DR:</b> That's right. This is normal thought. I can't tell you how true that is, you know people come in here, this is par for the course, money issues, family issues,  you shouldn't have lost the money daddy, this is normal [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I'll be fine. [NAME OTHER] was in a depression again cause she had to move and you know, I said at this point I would cut her down to $300 a month.
<b>DR:</b> You know she's not gonna take the cutting off laying down, she'll fight it.
<b>PT:</b> No, she's gonna be, it's really sad.
<b>DR:</b> Well and she's gonna play up depression and all that nonsense, I'd cut it off anyway. Well it's not just that, you want to encourage independence with her and she'll never ever find out if she's dependent on you.
<b>PT:</b> She is a nightmare.
<b>DR:</b> See you in a couple months, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Take care of yourself, bye, bye.
