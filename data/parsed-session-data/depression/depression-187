BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, the recorder is on and I'm not gonna, you can tell me your name and uh all that.
<b>PT:</b> My name is [PATIENT NAME].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm not doing good.  Ever since Friday I just very depressed. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Very, very depressed.  I don't want to do anything, see anybody - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Go anywhere.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  
<b>PT:</b> Just I sleep and eat all the time.  
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Just I'm very - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Very, very hopeless.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And what, do you know what might have brought uh. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I, uh, I got called in to the office at work on Friday - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> For my absences and I said, well, I'm pretty sure they should be under [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe I was calling in sick wrong.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, they told me to go ahead and get all my paperwork together, everything's gonna be, I thought it was gonna be fine.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> 10 minutes later they called me back in to the office and gave me a letter of warning.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I was like, well, I thought I was gonna have time to, yknow -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Get all my paperwork together and all that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> They said no and blah, blah, blah.  Well, I just got so mad I just left.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, I don't know, just everything's been, it's just - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It has just gone downhill.  I just wanna, I wanna cry all the time.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, it's, it's bad.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Now, uh with this, yknow, absentee, this, with the um, now, we gave, we gave you several of, on this one, letter stating.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's under [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I have everything to prove that it's under [DEIDENTIFIED].  
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But it's just the whole point.  I mean, I guess that's not really everything because then I have to deal with [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> He's constantly running his mouth, not bringing home his homework. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Not doing his homework.  
<b>DR:</b> Hum.
<b>PT:</b> He's bringing home, yknow, deficiency slips and conduct slips and - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Then I have to listen to [NAME OTHER] and then I have to -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Listen to [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, yknow, it's like I don't want to be a mother, I don't want to be a wife, I don't, I just wanna - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Run away and, and be by myself.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>PT:</b> I, I don't want the responsibility.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Now, of course when you have that much on your plate and uh uh, yknow, then every little thing can uh magnify.  And -
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And given that, have you been sleeping good?
<b>PT:</b> Sleeping good.  That's all I do is sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Sleep, uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> That's all I do is sleep.
<b>DR:</b> But then you have good night's rest?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I've been having nightmares.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And, and how do you handle those?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  It's like I just kind of roll over and go back to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> They're, they're not so bad where they - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> They really wake me up and um 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I guess they're, they're nightmares because it's, even though I want to run away and be by myself, it's -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> They're nightmares that everybody leaves me. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And then I don't have anybody.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So, you are left alone uh, either neglected or deserted or something like that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And uh uh, so uh uh then what happens in the nightmare?
<b>PT:</b> I just, I wake up then.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I wake up and I just kind of roll over. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I just go back to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So, although you have been sleeping more, you had not been resting like the way that you should, isn't that right?
<b>PT:</b> Probably.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So. 
<b>DR:</b> All right.  And uh uh because then, yknow, this is the situation you are in and uh when you have a, and uh either the home situation or the work situation, you're triggering something.  Okay?  Sometimes is causes a kindling.  Yknow, in fact you can get paranoid and then one kindles the other and one makes the other come to the surface and uh try to, and uh sometimes when the situation, stuff like that happens, yknow, like with [NAME OTHER], one little thing that he does, it becomes more of an opposition uh if he doesn't get all the attention of it.  So, because, yknow, being uh at that age, yknow, you pay it a lot of attention.  But when it comes to homework and all that, yknow, you, if he forgets to bring it and it comes to I just forgot, yknow, that's not a good enough answer.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> It's a, and uh what we may have to do in that case is that uh, yknow, maybe get some uh assistance from the teachers that remind him that uh. They mind him. 
<b>PT:</b> Well, they, they do.  
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But then like he has an agenda that he has to get signed.  Well, he gets, he gets conduct slips because he don't take it to school.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I can only do so much.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> That, [NAME OTHER], yknow, do you have it?  He says, yes.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  
<b>PT:</b> Well, he doesn't.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I asked him today, do you have your spelling book?  He said, yeah.  Well, it, he don't.  It's sitting right there on the landing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> When he goes out the door, he don't have it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  What you may have to do is uh make sure that you put it or somebody, yknow, puts it in his bag.  And uh, and, uh, yknow, because sometimes, yknow, they, even though the children have their school bag and uh, yknow, if uh, it can be quite habit and they take the book out.  When they finish everything, if they don't put it back immediately, then they forget that, yknow, as to where they kept it and all that.  And so you may have to, yknow, either you or his dad or his sister, yknow, one of you take a little bit of extra, yknow, effort because. 
<b>PT:</b> It's hard with my husband though.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. Because if everything is entrusted only on you, yknow, you, you can do only so much.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I know.  And if I'm the only one that's -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> That's willing to try and get him into these habits and that 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I can't work 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Do that - 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. 
<b>PT:</b> Yknow, clean the house, cook the dinner. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And try to work with him to getting in habits. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> that 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I just, I can't do it by myself.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I could probably do it by myself if my husband wasn't there.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because I wouldn't have him - 
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Yknow, yelling and screaming at him because he can't do this and he can't do that and -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I think that the last medicine that we put him on, that stuff ain't working for nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> That Zyprexa.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  
<b>PT:</b> That 
<b>DR:</b> It didn't do much of anything.
<b>PT:</b> He cannot get up in the morning. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> he's sleeping in school again.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I think it kind of helped a little bit with keeping his hands to himself. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> because I really haven't seen that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But it, wow.
<b>DR:</b> Do you remember how much I gave him?  Was it five or 2.5?
<b>PT:</b> I think it was, it might have been 5.  I don't remember.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Then what we will do is try the 2.5.  Okay?  And uh see if, yknow, it will uh, uh, if, if, if it is helping him and actually he's keeping his hands to himself, the 2.5 should do the same thing.  Okay?  I gave you samples, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-hum, uh-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Probably gave you - 
<b>PT:</b> Well, would, would something for um like the Concerta or anything like that -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Be better? 
<b>DR:</b> We can try the Concerta.  
<b>PT:</b> To, I'm just wondering, yknow -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because I just don't know what to do um to try to get him to slow down to remember these things that 
<b>DR:</b> This, this is what we will do, there are two medications - 
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, and uh I write you prescriptions for both.  One is called Concerta.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And one is Clonidine.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, he's had the Clonidine.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  He's already taking Clonidine?
<b>PT:</b> He doesn't take it now because we stopped everything but the Trileptal -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> With the Zyprexa, whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Because uh, yknow, Clonidine um uh is, yknow, point one and uh you can give him uh, first we will go with Concerta.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  And uh go with the 18 mg and uh uh see if there's any improvement.  You should see within a week's time.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  And uh uh then if there is, then what we will do is just to titrate it and um uh get it together.  Okay?  And if you do not see, we can titrate it from 18, we can go to 27.  By that time, yknow, we'll be able to tell.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Uh if it uh, if the improvement is minimal, that means that uh, yknow, we have to use the other approach. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  So, so, let's see what we can do.  And any other things going on?
<b>PT:</b> It's just trying to deal with everything, trying to deal with me having the problems that I'm having, trying to deal with [NAME OTHER]. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um just um, I just don't feel like my marriage is going very well.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.  Well, when there are things like this happening and uh with the uh children, there is a lot of responsibility.  If you are the only one, one who has to show that all day, yknow, it's, it's a joint effort.  And, yknow, if your role is that you do everything, including cooking your meal and all of that uh and, yknow, he doesn't uh give you enough support and all of that, then it becomes very, yknow, difficult.  So, so, let's see what we can do.  Okay?  And uh uh, yknow, the thing is when there is this situation of thing, yknow, it's, it takes a big toll on your uh emotions uh and uh everywhere you turn around there is something or the other.  Okay?  All right.  So, so, let's see what uh the situation is.  And anything else going on? 
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> That you can think of?  Okay.  All right.  And how much medicine do you have?
<b>PT:</b> To be honest I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, of course, yeah, uh, yknow, uh.
<b>PT:</b> Do I need to change any of my medicine or - 
<b>DR:</b> Not right now.  No.
<b>PT:</b> Do I, well, when I was talking to [NAME OTHER]. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Tuesday, I guess it was. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> She was saying that maybe I need something um, that my anxiety is high or. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum, um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't even know what she was 
<b>DR:</b> Do you remember what are the things you take?
<b>PT:</b> I take Trileptal
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Lexapro 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Lamictal 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Cymbalta 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And Provigil.  
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  What I'm going to do is, now, you have some breathing problems, is that right?
<b>PT:</b> Asthma, yes.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So, there is a medication called Buspar okay, and I'm going to uh, it comes in five, 10, 7.5, 10, 15 and all that.   Take 5 mg three times a day.  And then uh uh let's see what uh, what happens.  It's very good for anxiety.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> And, uh, uh, if, uh. 
<b>PT:</b> So, what if they don't make me come out of this mood? What's it gonna take?
<b>DR:</b> This will, yknow, uh get the anxiety component under control and -
<b>PT:</b> What's gonna get the crying component under control?
<b>DR:</b> I'm, yknow, if the anxiety is better, if the mood improves, okay, mood and anxiety go together hand in hand.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Do they?
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  And, actually, uh anxiety is a precursor to depression, which it can also be considered as uh precursors for mood changes.  Okay?  And - 
<b>PT:</b> That was something I was wondering too is 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Do you think it's bipolar or do you think it's more the manic depression? 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's actually the, yknow, the bipolar depression fits.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And uh, yknow, the bipolar is, especially the mixed type, yknow - 
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Is where you have uh uh significant emotional ability and uh uh, yknow, the, you can switch, yknow, with the minimum uh, this one um uh warning and uh then one day you can have umpteen, yknow, mood changes.  That kind of things.  Uh if it is a classic bipolar, it's uh the manic depression, it usually doesn't get, yknow switch that - 
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Abruptly and that quickly.  Okay?  And so let's see what uh we can do and 
<b>PT:</b> What about support groups? Do you think that would be a good idea?  
<b>DR:</b> Well, even uh, we have the bipolar support group. 
<b>PT:</b> Hm-hm.
<b>DR:</b> And also, yknow, one of the uh things here is if you can identify the type of things that uh make, yknow, mood uh go to one extreme or the other or the one side or the other, if you're able to recognize that, and that's what you're, in therapy with [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You're here to talk about that.  Because uh and conflict once you recognize what the conflict is, okay 
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And then you have an easier way of the better way to tackle that. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  Uh and uh like the, yknow, then all of a sudden it's like a bombshell, yknow, the, you go to work and uh now all of a sudden this is what they want to do.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And so within uh a short period of time, yknow, it ends up giving you enough time to, yknow, go through and uh give them an explanation.  Okay?  Because uh that's what the [DEIDENTIFIED] is, is that.  You cannot say that, bring your person and talk to that person and an hour later say that uh, yknow, I'm going to put something in your file that is negative.  So, that's what happened here.  
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You see?  And uh when you think of uh, now, you have been with the [DEIDENTIFIED] how many years?
<b>PT:</b> 12 and a half.
<b>DR:</b> 12 and a half years.  And, yknow, to uh all of a sudden have that 12 and a half years go down the drain -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And uh, yknow, the thing is, if you were not a good employee you would not have survived that long.  You see?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And so you have done your job, you have uh, yknow, uh done what needs to be done by an employee.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And uh, yknow, everyone has difficulties.  Okay?  And uh uh, yknow, you are at a stage where there are a few extra things happening.  And family support is uh also dwindling.  You see?  And, yknow, it's a big burden to, yknow, to put on your shoulders.
<b>PT:</b> What's the best way to, to get my husband to be able to cope with it or?
<b>DR:</b> Now, does he come to any kind of therapy?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Would he come?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> You can't 
<b>PT:</b> I mean, he, he's been to a couple of things with like me and [NAME OTHER], but. 
<b>DR:</b> If you can bring him next time when you come, okay 
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe you can uh, let's see what his understanding of the entire, yknow, family dynamics is and, and ways he can, yknow, step in and uh, uh give you just a little helping hand.  Okay?  You don't uh, you're a strong willed person, you can do a lot of things, but even the strong willed can falter.  Okay?  So, so, let's see what he understands, recognizes and all of that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  So, uh, uh -
