BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So has camp started?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yes.  We're into our fourth week.
<b>DR:</b> Oh my God.  It's getting hot now.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll tell ya, it takes all the energy out of you.  
<b>DR:</b> Are you feeling more down?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, quite a bit.  Down, angry, I don't know, I just seem overwhelmed.  I started to, I'm trying to get rid of a lot of accumulation over the thirty six years, I've been just throwing a lot of papers and odds and ends, it just seems endless.  On top of my duties, it's just, it's been a rough go over the last month or two.
<b>DR:</b> Anybody to help you?  Nobody?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Besides my own personal duties, I have, well for examples, photographs, like a backlog of stuff I need to get caught up on there.  I mean the photos are done, I just need to get them cataloged and in order.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, which takes a lot of time.
<b>PT:</b> And accumulation, I've got boxes and boxes of photos in my shop, I need to get them out of there.  They used to be in a separate room and that room the roof sprung a leak.  That was the year I was out in [DEIDENTIFIED].  I came back, I came back and here's the roof down, not the roof, the ceiling was -
<b>DR:</b> It's never been fixed?
<b>PT:</b> It's never got fixed.  I moved all the stuff out of there.  Well, I mean it's fixed now but I moved all the stuff out of there into my shop.  I need to get all those boxes out of there.  It's everywhere I look, there's just a mess.  I've been throwing away a lot of papers, a lot of personal stuff, like Sunday I started getting into a box that I had laying around for a long time, it's got letters in there, there's letters in there from almost forty years ago when I was up in [DEIDENTIFIED].  I used to do a lot of volunteer work for [DEIDENTIFIED] up there.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I started that because they brought a boy up from home, he just lived a few blocks from us and his mother and I think it was three brothers were killed in a fire.  He survived and they flew him up to [DEIDENTIFIED].  My mother told me about it so I started going over to visit him and after a few days he passed away and they asked me if I would mind coming over, yknow, continue coming over to visit the kids because, yknow, they're from all over the eastern United States and no visitors unless their family was in town and -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And put up by the [DEIDENTIFIED] somewhere but basically the kids didn't have any visitors so every day after school I was going over there but, anyway, I got all these clippings from his incident.  I hate to just throw them away but I guess I'm attached to it but I know I need to get rid of the stuff; letters, thank you letters from parents and things like that.
<b>DR:</b> It's hard, I don't, I try not to keep all the stuff because it just piles up like you say.
<b>PT:</b> It piles up and then you hate to throw it, I've been trying to do it.  I don't know, I just have so much accumulation, yknow, I've been out there thirty six years. 
<b>DR:</b> I know, you've gone over your whole life is the trouble. 
<b>PT:</b> I've got stacks and stacks of magazines.
<b>DR:</b> They could go.
<b>PT:</b> I hate to just throw them.  I mean they're good.
<b>DR:</b> I had to throw out a whole bunch of [DEIDENTIFIED] at one point, I mean, you know, piles of them.  I hated to do it but you've got to survive.
<b>PT:</b> There's a school that I've read about, somebody, I think it's down in [DEIDENTIFIED] or something, it's kind of connected with [DEIDENTIFIED], I think it's a retired air force officer, it's kind of like an aerospace education thing, something like what I was doing, so I was thinking about maybe when school cranks up, maybe I'll get in touch with him and see if he wants them because they're all like aviation magazines.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> Different kinds, history, aviation history, that's always good.
<b>DR:</b> That's true.
<b>PT:</b> History doesn't change, so I hate to just toss them.  I used to give them out to our kids but they didn't seem to be all that interested, maybe because they're too young or something.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean -
<b>PT:</b> I mean they were interested -
<b>DR:</b> What do they know, outer space and yknow.
<b>PT:</b> They're interested, not interested enough to where they wanted to grab a handful of magazines and take them home. 
<b>DR:</b> Maybe they got a library in [DEIDENTIFIED]. 
<b>PT:</b> Maybe I could haul, some of the newer ones especially, over to the [DEIDENTIFIED] or something.  Yeah, that's been my big bugaboo right now is trying to get of all of this accumulation.  
<b>DR:</b> Well, is there a time schedule?  
<b>PT:</b> No.  I never get eight hours of sleep, that's just -
<b>DR:</b> I mean you don't have to have it done by a certain day -
<b>PT:</b> No, no, I just feel pressured to get it done.  I don't know I -
<b>DR:</b> Well, you've only got so much time a week, yknow, when you're not working so I mean be easy on yourself.  You've probably only got an hour and a half a day at the most, it sounds like.
<b>PT:</b> I guess what's the worst, the worst of it, I've been working on trying to do it, it just seems endless.  Every time I turn around there's another box or another whatever full of something.
<b>DR:</b> You're going to get to a couple of points where you go, okay that goes, I don't care.
<b>PT:</b> That's kind of like what I've been doing. 
<b>DR:</b> That's what happened when I moved, yknow, out of the house, twenty years of stuff.
<b>PT:</b> I'm basically chucking stuff but you get attached to things, yknow, these thank you letters and things from parents.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I might save a couple but -
<b>PT:</b> Well -
<b>DR:</b> How much can you save.
<b>PT:</b> Even there, I said what's the use of saving, what's it going to do for me, it's just an attachment.  I just kinda hate to break with it but I haven't had contact with these people.  Some of the kids used to write to me but now they're all grown up right now, they must be in their fifties now.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because it was like, they were like [AGE] or whatever when I knew them and that was back in the sixties.  
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I guess the best thing is just to take it and toss it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Enjoy the memory.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm trying to do that and keep up with my duties and it just seems like I'm on the run all the time out there, running errands.
<b>DR:</b> Well, are you taking the Paxil now or did we stop it?
<b>PT:</b> No, we stopped it.  Maybe I should go back on something.
<b>DR:</b> We should probably put it back, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Hit me on the head with something or do something.
<b>DR:</b> Well, 'cause I don't want you to get down where you were.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm pretty down right now.
<b>DR:</b> No, let's put it back.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So 25 CR, you've got the pills?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, the CR, I don't have any.
<b>DR:</b> No, Okay.  
<b>PT:</b> It just hasn't been good.  I haven't been happy at all.  And another thing, the first time that, at least the first one that I remember, was when I was going on retreat at the beginning of June.  I kinda get like a panic attack, just sitting there in the chapel, then all of the sudden I just feel very uneasy about everything.  I don't know what's going on.
<b>DR:</b> Things are changing though, I mean even though you're in the same place, the place is changing. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is quite a bit.
<b>DR:</b> And I think that's enough to do it, my gosh.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, quite a bit of change.  I've got that school coming in and then we've got, of course, we've already had the parish for about seven years or more but they just seem to come in and, yknow, they just seem to be taking over different parts.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> They moved over from their property over to our place and just like the other day, this one fellow we have out there in the community, I don't really want to mention names but he wanted to go out and get some of these Popsicle like things for the kids when they have like bingo for prizes, so I went out and got one or two boxes, so I got the two boxes and I went in the kitchen, our big freezer there, I couldn't even get in it, it was locked.  The parish has everything locked up.  It's our freezer, yknow, it was ours when it was, but they just kinda seemed to come in and take over things.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, somebody ought to release that.  I mean, you're right, yknow, it's the second story you've told me like that.
<b>PT:</b> I don't say, I try not to say anything because whenever I say anything, it just seems to get their tempers up so I just tend to back off and try to shut up.   I finally found space for them upstairs, and we just fixed a little kitchenette upstairs for ourselves because our dining room that we used to have downstairs, they took that over and, of course, we don't have our own cooking, we go over to the other place for our suppers, actually, some of the guys go over there for all three meals but I don't, I just go over at supper but I finally found room in our refrigerator, our new refrigerator upstairs,  I just barely squeezed it in.  There's one guy, again I don't know if I should mentioned titles or anything, but he's go so much stuff, he's just got bags of this and containers of that.  He's just got, food -
<b>DR:</b> In the fridge you mean?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and we have our old refrigerator downstairs and even that, he's got that filled with stuff and he and one of the other guys, they kind of tick me off because they don't do anything, they do nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> Well the one was born with a birth defect so his legs are kind of like deformed and he walks with a shuffle and he doesn't do anything.  He answers the phone for a little bit in the afternoon.  Yknow, you're knocking yourself out all day long and then you see him sitting around in the easy chair or over at the other residence sitting there outside sunning himself, he's just sitting there with this stupid grin on his face and, yknow, boy, he's there for all the meals, I'll tell you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's not his fault but still, why are they sending all these people down here.  For one thing, it's bad for morale, I think.  He's not living over at that retirement home, he's living with us but he goes over there for all his meals and he spends practically all day over there watching TV - 
<b>DR:</b> Might as well move over there.
<b>PT:</b> And talking to his friends over there.  He should be over there but he's still at our place and then this other guy got hurt in the accident, I think I mentioned to you before, he got hit by a car, he was riding a bicycle.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And he busted up one of his legs.  He can get around pretty good but he doesn't lift a finger to do anything.  I just get so discouraged.  Like I said -
<b>DR:</b> Do you have regular meetings of the guys that live there or anything?
<b>PT:</b> We haven't had a community meeting, besides, like I said, you bring stuff up like this and it just seems to get the tempers of the bosses up so I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> But it makes sense to me that they ought to be having some kind of regular meeting because there is so much change, just to keep up with it, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> Well they do have meetings, I don't know what to mention with that tape on but they do have different council meetings which I'm not involved in but now tonight they're having a meeting and it's supposed to be dealing with the parish and so on, different things like that, and it's going to be, they're going to have the meeting out, it's going to be like a dinner meeting and I was asked to come to it because I'm working with the kids.  Not everybody is going to it, I guess just members of the parish council and the bosses and those of us that are working with the kids so, in other words, those people I just mentioned, they're not going but I really don't know what the purpose of me going is, yknow, they do what they want to do and my opinions never seem to count anyway so why the heck am I going. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, you don't know, I mean you still may have ideas that make things better.
<b>PT:</b> No, I've just kinda like given up on it.  It's seems like whenever I've said anything in the past, it's just either totally ignored or, I don't know, I just -
<b>DR:</b> Well when I go to those meetings, I just figure I'm going to say what I think.   I mean I'm not going to cause trouble but they can take it or leave it.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not trying to cause trouble, I just mention things and it just sometimes seem to, I don't know, get tempers up.  
<b>DR:</b> Well, what's true is true.
<b>PT:</b> We've got this one guy that's out there, he just came in the Fall and God he's all over the place performing weddings and just got back again, he was off, I don't know where he went to but he was gone over the weekend, he got back yesterday sometime.  I mean he just disappears and goes here there and everywhere.  He went out to [DEIDENTIFIED] Christmas time, I'm pretty sure I mentioned that to you.  He went out on space available, we got him a space available ticket.  He got out there and then he couldn't get back because of all the bad weather.  He had to pay six hundred dollars to get back, he had to get a ticket.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so space available didn't save anything there boy.
<b>PT:</b> No.  He drives me nuts because of his personal habits, loud sneezing and constantly snorting and it's just, I just try to stay clear of him and he's always got his, his friends always seem to come on the weekends, they're [DEIDENTIFIED] and they've got, like the [DATE] there was a whole gang of them out there. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, they're all [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> All day long.  Well he is, his friends just seem to come from all over the place.  They were out there all day long, late into the night, and it just seems totally wacky compared to what it used to be out there.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it is changing, man, that's for sure.
<b>PT:</b> I've had people say why don't you move to a new place.  Shoot, I've been here so long, I hate to, I'm almost [AGE] and at this age, I hate to pack up and start moving somewhere else. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I think it's in transition that it will settle down into what it's going to be but it's not there yet, so you are in a place that's in transition.  Transition could take a couple of years.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't know, after that problem with that new school that's coming in there, a guy that's throwing [INAUDIBLE] away, I haven't had any contact, I haven't even seen him around.  I think he's supposed to be like the headmaster but I haven't seen him around.  I kind of think if he was out there every day, kind of getting things in order and throwing stuff, including my stuff -
<b>DR:</b> Amateurs.
<b>PT:</b> But I'm definitely not going to get involved with him, like I had mentioned to you that he was interested in getting me involved with teaching the kids with the models, no way.
<b>DR:</b> Besides we discussed that kind of kid, you just don't fit that, like I don't fit going in and working in a cancer ward, you don't fit that kind of patients either.
<b>PT:</b> No, I mean with all the things I have to do as it is now, I just don't want to get involved in the regular school setting.  Going down to the villa, yknow, volunteering there, that's different, I just go down for a couple of hours at lunchtime and they come over.
<b>DR:</b> It's all they expect.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, I'm not there for like teacher's meetings and I don't have to turn in marks and things like that.
<b>DR:</b> That's better.
<b>PT:</b> It's just a separate thing, they can either go run around and play games or they can just sit down and work on something, so it's a different situation but to get in again into a school situation where you have to go to teacher's meetings and they can turn in marks and progress reports, nah, I don't want any part of that.
<b>DR:</b> I know those kids are difficult so it's not the same.
<b>PT:</b> No.  I've seen some of them -
<b>DR:</b> It takes a special person to do that, I'll tell you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've seen some of them out there earlier, like in the spring they were out there helping, I guess they came from one of their other schools and they seemed okay.  I've been told that these kids are not the worst of the autism, they're more like socially withdrawn a little bit, that kind of thing.
<b>DR:</b> They're still pretty weird, they don't relate the same.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just, I'm not going to get involved at all, I don't care what that guy says.  I'm just waiting now to see if he wants to make a move to like, to well okay if you don't want to do it but can we use your shop, so I don't know, he hasn't said that but I'm just waiting to see if something like that comes up.  I think if that happens, well I'll just take my stuff and just move out of there, I don't know, I just don't know what to do.  It just seems like every time I turn around I'm getting punched in the face. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, you better take the Paxil so you can feel better.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was thinking Boy, I better go back on something, I guess.  When I got off of it I was thinking well that's good, I don't need that anymore.
<b>DR:</b> This is the 25, I'm only giving you thirty days worth because we may raise it or change the dose or something.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> So get, just get that this time.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, I'll get that filled.  It takes a while for this to build up too, doesn't it?
<b>DR:</b> Say four to fourteen days, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe it will help because -
<b>DR:</b> Why don't you come back in about three weeks, we should know how it's doing.
<b>PT:</b> I'm definitely not, I'm definitely not in a good mood.  I mean, I relating to the kids okay.  I've got a bunch of them in there, I've got lots of models but even that can get overwhelming because I can get like sixteen kids in there and get three, four, or five asking for help all at the same time, they're all talking to me at the same time.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> There's this junior counselor and he's sitting there, like the one I had yesterday, he came in and the first thing he did was he sat up on the table and I told him, I said hey, we invented chairs so he got off the table and then he sat there, then he put his head down on the table, yknow, he's totally worthless so I'm just in there with these kids basically by myself.
<b>DR:</b> How old is he?
<b>PT:</b> He must be about [AGE], [AGE].   I think they have to be [AGE] to start as junior counselors, yeah, he's definitely high school, they're all high school.  They're good kids and, I don't know, maybe he was just tired but generally speaking, when they come in, most of them, they don't know anything about models and they're really no help to me, they're just taking up space.  Like another one came in yesterday and he was busy talking to two of the kids and I had like three or four kids asking for help and he was just visiting with these other two, I just feel like ripping my hair out sometimes. 
<b>DR:</b> They need somebody to train them.
<b>PT:</b> Well, it's not their fault, yknow, they're doing good jobs with the different activities, it's just when they come in to my place, they don't know anything about models, there's not much they can do.  And they tell me that they don't know much about them.  Every now and then I'll get one in there that knows a little bit and they'll help out but generally speaking they're not much help to me at all.  
<b>DR:</b> You got to get them and make them build a couple so they know what the hell it is.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if that would help.  Anyway, it's been a rough go, that's all I've got to say.
<b>DR:</b> All right, you're going to make it.  The place is just all loose.
<b>PT:</b> It's a whirlwind.  I'm living in a whirlwind.  I keep thinking that, what's the biblical saying, God isn't in the whirlwind, something like that.  I keep praying but I'll tell you -
