BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> How you been?
<b>PT:</b> I'm good.
<b>DR:</b> Good, good.  What's new anything?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well the practice is goin' real well.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> I'm up to about 20 clients a week.
<b>DR:</b> Excellent.  Boy, that was fast.
<b>PT:</b> It was.
<b>DR:</b> Wow, that's unusual because I know a lot of folks, it takes them a while to build up.
<b>PT:</b> I expected it would, so it was pretty scary goin' into it but, uh, it's, it's going very well.
<b>DR:</b> Excellent.
<b>PT:</b> So, I'm thrilled with that. I feel lucky.
<b>DR:</b> And are you doing more cash, or are you on insurance plans?  I can't remember.
<b>PT:</b> Insurance primarily. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have a handful of people that are paying me out of pocket.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  So, that's good.  I think, in this community, it seems much easier if you're on insurance plans, since 'cause so many people have coverage, so.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So how, how busy do you wanna get, do you know?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I think 25 a week?
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you're almost there.
<b>PT:</b> Somewhere between 25 and 30 would be good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, yknow, I don't wanna be crazy but I wanna be able to pay my bills and my overhead.
<b>DR:</b> Sure, that helps.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh, be able to set some aside for, yknow, vacation time being on my own book.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  Yep, that's important.  Well, good, good.  So, that's working very well.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Excellent.  Any major problems or glitches you've run into?  Or just kinda gradually building?
<b>PT:</b> Yknow, when I get someone from other therapists that I know and stuff like that, so, uh, it's not all insurance, but it's good.  I really like it.  I really like being my own boss.
<b>DR:</b> It has its advantages doesn't it.
<b>PT:</b> Not having to pretend I'm busy when I'm not, I go home.  Yknow?
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  And where's your office?
<b>PT:</b> Union and Academy. 
<b>DR:</b> Union and Academy, okay.
<b>PT:</b> It's actually Montabella and Academy, but a lot of people aren't familiar with Montabella, it's just one more street north of Union.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, I'm thinking are you by Target or by the library or
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Closer to Target.
<b>PT:</b> By Target.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, I know.
<b>PT:</b> Sort of Montabello is the street on the edge of Target.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yes, west.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Or by like [INAUDIBLE], over in that area.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.  It's between [INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I think I know where you're at then.  Good.  Because I don't think there's any therapists kind of at the north end of town either, are there?
<b>PT:</b> Well, that seems to be helping, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> 'Cause that's, it's sort of the new center of town with everything expanding
<b>DR:</b> Yep.
<b>PT:</b> East.
<b>DR:</b> It's shifting.
<b>PT:</b> So.
<b>DR:</b> Good, good.  Is that close to where you live, too?
<b>PT:</b> It's not too bad, I live by [INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE], so I'm on the old north end.  
<b>DR:</b> Okay, uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But, uh, it's not bad at all.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> And Union is under construction, so.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, what, 15, 20 minutes or so to get to work?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  So, your spirits been pretty good overall, then?
<b>PT:</b> Pretty good, I think I've having some stuff that's related to menopause.
<b>DR:</b> Okay
<b>PT:</b> Just mood swings.  Um, I'll be really happy, full of energy, full of ideas and things to do and then I'll go through a period of being like extremely depressed and, yknow, these things'll last like a few days, um, and so it's kinda hard.  Because, because it's such a drastic swing.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> The other thing is I'm not sleeping as well.
<b>DR:</b> Are you having trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep?
<b>PT:</b> I fall asleep fine, but I wake up at 2 or 3 and I'm wide awake.  I have to get up and do something for about an hour and, um, again, I think that's probably related to menopause.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you still using the Trazodone and the Ambien?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I am.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And I started kinda inching up on them.
<b>DR:</b> That's fine.  The Trazodone is the 1 that's pry better at keeping you asleep.
<b>PT:</b> Is it?
<b>DR:</b> Ambien's better at getting people to sleep, so, if you wanted to bump 1 up on the Trazodone, it will probably be more helpful keeping you asleep.  How much are you taking of it now?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I've been taking 5 of the Trazodone, so.
<b>DR:</b> So 250.  Okay, and how much Ambien?
<b>PT:</b> That's pretty high already, isn't it?
<b>DR:</b> Well, you can go up to 400, so.
<b>PT:</b> The Ambien I take half of the low dose pill.
<b>DR:</b> So that's 5 mg tablets and you're taking 2.5.
<b>PT:</b> And sometimes, I'll actually, yknow, pinch off like a bigger half and do that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum, okay.
<b>PT:</b> But and some of that, I think, is related to, I don't just call it hot flashes.  I call it temperature disregulation because it's like your thermostat's off.  It's, yknow, you'll be cold, then you'll be hot.
<b>DR:</b> Ah.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not having too much, I'm not having problems with night sweats.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'll get a hot flash, but I don't think the insomnia is directly correlated to that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, okay.
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] was saying that a low dose of Prozac can help with hot flashes.
<b>DR:</b> They say
<b>PT:</b> I said that being on the high dose of Effexor, I would think, would have the same effect.
<b>DR:</b> It's supposed to.  Any of the medicines that increase serotonin are supposed to help some women with hot flashes.  Unfortunately, it doesn't always work.  And Effexor does increase serotonin so at least in theory, you'd think it might help.
<b>PT:</b> Well, too, I don't know what it'd be like if I weren't on it.  Yknow, it might be a lot worse.
<b>DR:</b> True.  That's a good point.  Now
<b>PT:</b> Because I don't really break into a sweat.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I just get that feeling where all of a sudden the heat's been turned way up.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.  Where you're awake for an hour, then you get back to sleep and then you wake up, you feel rested, or are you tired?
<b>PT:</b> I'm tired, then.  I don't wanna get up.  It's like I fall into that deep sleep and then I gotta get up.
<b>DR:</b> And then during the day do you feel tired, or is your energy level okay?
<b>PT:</b> I'm good during the day.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm good during the day.  Unless it's 1 of those where I'm in that depressed place.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  How's your appetite been?
<b>PT:</b> Um, the same.
<b>DR:</b> It's stable.  Okay.  Have you been able to focus and concentrate reasonably well, yknow, with getting woken up.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> My memory's been really poor.
<b>DR:</b> Short term, long term?
<b>PT:</b> Forgetting things I've done.
<b>DR:</b> Like in the last few minutes, or like years ago?
<b>PT:</b> No, forgetting things I've done like in the past couple months.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So, I mean, I felt, this little example.  I got some flowers the other day and I went to get my vase to put them in and I can't find the vase.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> So this vague recollection that I took flowers to somebody and took the vase, knowing I might not get it back, but I can't, I don't know if that's for sure, and I don't know who.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Well, that's not something I do on a regular basis so it's odd to me that I can't remember who or what, um.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I think, I think it's just related to the busyness of the practice and things like that that I think my mind's been more scattered, but, I don't know if that's it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I don't know if that's sleep related or other related.  Um, how about anxiety or panic attacks, any problems recently?
<b>PT:</b> Um, some anxiety with the depression, but that's, that's not the key feature.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, it hasn't developed
<b>PT:</b> And no panic attacks.
<b>DR:</b> Into full blown attacks, okay.  Okay.  Are you enjoying yourself these days with day to day activities?
<b>PT:</b> Um, sometimes I'm not.  And then other times, I just don't care about anything, so
<b>DR:</b> So it just kinda comes and goes.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> I hate to put this out there because it's so ridiculous, but yknow, sometimes when I'm down, it's like thinking about suicide down.
<b>DR:</b> Ah, so
<b>PT:</b> And I've never acted on it, it's just that that feeling of hopeless, desperate, tired, I give up, um, and then other days just feeling on top of the world.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.  Now, on top of the world, is this, have there been many bipolar swings that are manic swings.  You don't feel like euphoric, elated like, um - 
<b>PT:</b> I'd call it hippomanic maybe?
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, it's not like I have grandiose delusions or anything like that.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I think it's just feeling high energy and gosh, I gotta do this, I gotta do this.  Some of it I think is just really positive stuff that's come out of going into private practice.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And kinda feeling in charge of my own life
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> With some other changes I've made.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> So
<b>DR:</b> So, it doesn't cause problems for you when you feel really good.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> It's not going to the point where you're spinning excessively or making impulsive decisions.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And how long do those good times last?  Do they go on for days or weeks?  Or is it more hours to days?
<b>PT:</b> Well, for a while there it was weeks, and it was jus, it was just great, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It was like I'm doin' this thing, I'm in charge of my own life, I'm free, I can plan my own time, everything like that, um, I had no anxiety about starting this private practice, and I should've had some, but I didn't.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's worked well for you.
<b>PT:</b> A couple weeks that were alone in August, but I didn't get anxious then, either.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> And sure enough, it snapped right back down.  So, now it's more like it'll be a few days.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, it doesn't sound like it's anything detrimental or harmful, like a hippomanic phase where you're getting into impulsive or dangerous or risky decisions or anything like that.  It sounds like it's not
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I do spend too much considering my income right now.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, it's nothing outrageous.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, okay.  Um, and medication wise, any side effects or problems that you're aware of?
<b>PT:</b> Nothing new.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  You're taking them pretty consistently.
<b>PT:</b> Pretty consistently.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] my meds.
<b>DR:</b> That's smart.  And if you can remember, that's good too.  A lot of people just forget.
<b>PT:</b> Well, one thing, yeah, if I forget to take my medication in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> By mid afternoon, I'm crashing.
<b>DR:</b> So you can feel it.
<b>PT:</b> I feel it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Especially with Effexor.  That's probably the 1, more than any other anti depressant that people really notice if they don't take it.  Uh, the absence of it is really noticeable which helps remind people to take people if [INAUDIBLE] kind of rough sometimes.  Goodness gracious.  So, let's see, you're on 2 things.  You still taking Buspar twice a day?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Three Effexor each morning.  Trazodone and Ambien at night.  And again, you can take more, especially the Trazodone, and the way you'll know if you're taking too much Trazodone is you'll be groggy in the morning, it'd be hard to wake up then you probably need to back off a little bit.  If you're not groggy in the morning from the medicine, then you can go up a little higher if you want to or need to.  If you wanta just ride this out, you could, too.  It's up to you.  But again, the maximum is 400 so you're not there yet.  Although it's rare people get to that much because usually by the time they get to 400, people are usually pretty groggy in the morning.  Um, and that's it, so, uh, anything else?
<b>PT:</b> There is 1 question I have is, well, I'm on the regular Ambien.
<b>DR:</b> Uh hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I've seen the commercials for the Ambien
<b>DR:</b> CR
<b>PT:</b> Extended.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Would that help with this?
<b>DR:</b> It might.  It, it, often those people stay asleep another hour or 2 before it wears off.  It's not as good at getting people to sleep, though.  So, if you're not having trouble getting to sleep, we could try it and see if you sleep longer with the CR, um, if you're having trouble getting to sleep, a lot of people don't like the CR as well because it doesn't give them as much up front, so they don't fall asleep as easily.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> Um, now with you taking the Trazodone, too, I don't know for sure how it would work.  If you wanna try it, I've got some samples.  You could try and just see if you like it better.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, 'cause I refilled the regular so.
<b>DR:</b> You want me to give you some samples.
<b>PT:</b> Some samples would be good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, I'll give you some and you can see what you think.
<b>PT:</b> And then I'll try just adding a Trazodone.  I'll try them separately and see what helps best.
<b>DR:</b> That's a good idea.  Let me give you both strengths of the CR.  There's 6.25 or a 12.5.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Here's a couple of each.
<b>PT:</b> Thanks.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.  And if you find that you like 1 or the other, just call me and I'll call in a prescription for you for whichever 1 works the best.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And, uh, if you try the 6.25, it's about the same as the 5 Ambien now that you're taking, although these, you're not supposed to cut them in half, so you're actually gonna be getting more medication, too, 'cause if you're taking a half of a 5 and you go to a 6.25, it's kinda like doubling your dose.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Which is still fine.  You can also go up to 12.5 which would be like quadrupling your dose.  If you do that, you might have to back off a little bit on the Trazodone.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, I'll let you try it and see what you think and if you have questions, just call me, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But we'll see if that helps you get longer sleep.  That's really important.
<b>PT:</b> You know, part of why I cut back on the Ambien is because I really did have problems with that, uh, amnesia.
<b>DR:</b> That's right.
<b>PT:</b> For the evening.  It's, it's not just, yknow, take it and go to bed because once you've taken it, you may not remember.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> It was like I had foggy memory for the evening, even prior to taking the medication.
<b>DR:</b> Really.  And that may happen again if you go up on the dose.  That's something you have to be careful about.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But you, you can try it.  It's a little different.  It's a slower release.  It might, um, again carry you more through the night.  It doesn't hit you as hard up front, so again you may not, I don't know if you'll have amnesia or not, so if you do, they'll back off and go back to the immediate release and up the Trazodone.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Does that sound reasonable?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  If you have any questions, call me because there are other things we could try, too, besides this.  I'm trying to remember, did you ever try Lunesta for example?
<b>PT:</b> No. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, Lunesta's another sleep medicine that doesn't have as much memory impairment associated with it that seems to last a little bit longer than the Ambien for some people.
<b>PT:</b> Really?
<b>DR:</b> And there's some others out there, too.  Those are the, Ambien and Lunesta are pry the 2 most commonly used sleep meds these days and Trazodone.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But, uh, we can try different combinations if this doesn't work.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  What else?  Any other questions, concerns, problems?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] those are all things that are going well.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, doing really well.  Oh, 1 other question, when you do have those dips, do they seem to be situationally triggered, something stressful happen, or did they just seem to come out of the blue?
<b>PT:</b> Um, they, there's not a situational thing where I can point at anything.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> They do seem to be worse on weekends.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But now last weekend was tough for me.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, or maybe I should say 2 weekends ago, but this weekend was good.  It's just like I had a different frame of mind, um.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And do you know what it is about weekends that could be the trigger?  Is it being alone more, is it - 
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes being alone more and having less structure.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But to me, it's the chicken and egg thing because a lot of times, like if I'm in a good mood, I create my weekend and I make it fun and it doesn't matter so much if I'm doing stuff by myself or with other people.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It's like gosh, I'm getting this done, I'm gonna do that and, um, I have the energy to do things.  Other weekends I have opportunities and I don't feel like going.  So, to me, a lot of times, it feels like the mood precipitates the weekend and then once I'm in it, I, it's worse, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> So you said the mood precipitates the weekend.  So, kinda how you're feeling Friday evening going into the weekend you mean?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, okay.  Well, I'm thinkin' again, too, maybe if you get better sleep during the week, you're more rested, that may help you deal with the week better and be a little more rested during the week, I would hope.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, okay, yeah, so let's work with the sleep meds to see if we can get you sleepin' better and see if it helps with the lows.  If it doesn't, we have some other things we can do to try to prevent those dips that you're having, too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, anything else you can think of at this point?  Okay, I was gonna check on refills real quickly.  Looks like we're good on the Buspar 'til November, um, Effexor we're good through June.  The Trazodone, we're good through November and the Ambien, um, did not use the refill.
<b>PT:</b> I think I would need a phone call before I refill it again, but I just refilled it.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you just got it, okay, so, we're good for now.
<b>PT:</b> I'll give you a call.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, you're just gonna let me know that if you need anything else.  I think we're good.  All right.  Um, should we just set up a time to check back?  Is 3 months about right for you, or do you wanna check in sooner this time or 
<b>PT:</b> Two months this time, just to
<b>DR:</b> Okay, we're making some changes.
<b>PT:</b> That and going into fall and
<b>DR:</b> That sounds good.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know I'm thinking about maybe getting one of those full spectrum lights.
<b>DR:</b> I know, more and more people are using them with good success.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, most people are paying about 2 to 250 for them.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Using them 20, 30 minutes in the morning and I know a lot of people say it's really helping.  Especially with daylight getting shorter, so it's
<b>PT:</b> What I'm thinking, my schedule for private practice might help because more people need late appointments than early, and so a lot of days I don't really have to be there until 11 or so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And so just having some time in the morning where there's daylight before I take off, get out and walk the dog or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> That sounds good.  Well, let's see, so 2 months will put us into November.  You wanna do something like this, around 8:30 again?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, I've got either Monday the [DATE]12th or Wednesday the 14th of November, if either of those will work.
<b>PT:</b> Um, let's stick with the Monday.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Eight thirty.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Would you like a reminder card also.
<b>PT:</b> No, I've got it in here and that's the most reliable thing.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Sounds good.
<b>PT:</b> I've got a cruise coming up in November.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, where are you going?
<b>PT:</b> I had set this up before I made this decision to go into private practice, so I just thought I'm gonna keep it.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's too fun.
<b>PT:</b> So.
<b>DR:</b> That'll be a good time of year, too, probably.
<b>PT:</b> I'm goin' with my sister and her family and
<b>DR:</b> How many days?
<b>PT:</b> Seven.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that'll be nice.  That's a good way just to get away isn't it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  I'm sure you'll have a great time.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, well.
<b>DR:</b> Good seeing you.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Good seeing you.  You bet.
<b>PT:</b> Take care.
<b>DR:</b> You, too.  Call if you have any questions or need anything.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> And I'll see you in a couple of months.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Bye bye.
