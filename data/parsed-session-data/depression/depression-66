BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:


COUNSELOR: Let's see this, is the first hour, 1970. Hi, what are you feeling?


PATIENT: (chuckling) What do I feel like? Oh, a bit apprehensive I suppose [inaudible at 0:00:29.5]... getting into something new here.


COUNSELOR: Okay, [inaudible at 0:00:37.5]... 


PATIENT: Well, yeah, I mean you know, because like... 


COUNSELOR: I don't know.


PATIENT: Well, it's sort of an artificial thing... 


COUNSELOR: Yeah?


PATIENT: ...getting to meet somebody who...you don't just get to meet with casual everyday boy (ph). [0:00:53.4]


COUNSELOR: We never talk about the wedding?


PATIENT: Talk about the wedding?


COUNSELOR: We don't talk about.


PATIENT: Right.


COUNSELOR: And that comes into it (ph)?


PATIENT: Well, I...have to break you up or I got to break you up or we got to break me out of here. (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: You mean kind of like uncomfortably though?


PATIENT: It's semi uncomfortable. I mean, I'm not really uncomfortable (ph). [0:01:20.8] 


COUNSELOR: Not terribly uncomfortable, just a little?


PATIENT: [I think enough said.] (ph)


COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:01:24.2]... It sounds like you shifting a lot? Are you shifting in how you're feeling or?


PATIENT: Not much.


COUNSELOR: Not much?


PATIENT: Not really. There's (chuckling) I don't know where to begin.


COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess any place is okay to. What have you been doing?


PATIENT: (chuckling) We desire to be growing out, sort of, because I really don't know...where to start. I mean, I feel kind of silly about sitting here... 


COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:02:45.3]... 


PATIENT: ...because like it will really sound very egotistic, just very simply [inaudible at 0:02:52.4]... Just, I mean, I just feel I'd be starting something out without (ph) really feel like...I'm, we're relating and because like [inaudible at 0:03:01.7]... 


COUNSELOR: Do you want to?


PATIENT: I suppose.


COUNSELOR: Well, that's [overlapping voices at 0:03:08.2]... 


PATIENT: I mean...just, I mean, right, right now it's just on a matter of professional basis that we're talking. [inaudible at 0:03:16.6]... Yeah, I want to because or else this won't make any sense, won't do any good.


COUNSELOR: You want to and you'd like me to help by some how encouraging you or... 


PATIENT: Oh, yeah!


COUNSELOR: ...by doing what I... 


PATIENT: Well, I was just speaking about right now...getting started.


COUNSELOR: The best way to start is to talk about what you're feeling right now, with whatever is important you'll be feeling, but that's sometimes really hard to do.


PATIENT: Yeah. Well like, I mean, most of what I'm feeling now is just uneasiness about not exactly knowing what to do, the feeling that it is a strange situation.


COUNSELOR: Uneasy, kind of squirmy or is it uneasiness for different?


PATIENT: Well, it's in a way squirmy, it's a little bit sweaty and [inaudible at 0:04:13.2]... yes (ph). I mean, it's somewhat tense, not...not really super tense. Because...nothing awful is going to happen, it's just a matter of something useful. I mean, I want something useful to happen and so that's not happening.


COUNSELOR: Nothing useful is happening? That you see me... 


PATIENT: (chuckling) No, no, no, no. I'm saying I want something useful to happen and so, if I just sit here and don't say anything, well, that's not very useful I don't think or I don't find it very useful or I find that all I do is just get more tense about the whole thing and tend to or I blame you for it.


COUNSELOR: My fault because I let you be tense instead of... 


PATIENT: Not letting it be tense, just...I don't know where to go and like you're supposed to be helping me, which is what's going on here I mean.


COUNSELOR: Yeah, and so you're thinking, "Well now (ph) she's supposed to be helping me..." 


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: "...and I don't know what to do."


PATIENT: Right.


COUNSELOR: ..."I've never done this before now."


PATIENT: Well, I've tried actually.


COUNSELOR: We all are. "And so I tried but he wasn't so helpful or I wouldn't be in the shape I'm in and so."


PATIENT: I don't really feel bitter about it. I mean, I, well I do sort of. Well, like it... 


COUNSELOR: It don't help?


PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) It's, it just didn't work. I mean, what would happen if we both just sit there forever and ever?


COUNSELOR: [I'm thinking.] (ph) [0:05:44.1]


PATIENT: Oh, I was just, I was you know, and it was... 


COUNSELOR: I don't know.


PATIENT: (chuckling) [inaudible at 0:05:51.3]... 


COUNSELOR: I guess you've seen my [a no-no folder] (ph) about you today (ph)?


PATIENT: Yeah. Well, it keeps [inaudible at 0:05:57.3]... 


COUNSELOR: And you kind of like that?


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: Surprises you or not?


PATIENT: What, that you say it? Well, why? It's pleasant enough, I mean, when you say it. Because you're right, I should stop saying because it doesn't show anything. I, it's just, it's an ah, er, um, type...thing, it's just a form of speech.


COUNSELOR: But it feels pleasant to hear me say, "Hey, no, I don't know."


PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, you've been pleasant so far this whole time, which is...entirely different from six weeks ago, with what I went through left (ph) and she was really nervous the whole time too. [So I just wanted to tell you that.] (ph) [0:06:38.1] I mean, she didn't seem very comfortable. She seemed as uncomfortable as I did [the whole time.] (ph)


COUNSELOR: How do I seem?


PATIENT: How do you seem?


COUNSELOR: Comfortable, uncomfortable?


PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, totally comfortable [inaudible at 0:06:51.1]... Well, I mean, it makes me feel good. It makes me feel easier in this, to sit here and talk.


COUNSELOR: Like some how that we're not both uncomfortable and then you're burdened some way or something?


PATIENT: Well, it's just a matter of...you're going to, if your discomfort I think would come mainly from the fact that you wouldn't know exactly what to do...like if... 


COUNSELOR: How did that grab you?


PATIENT: Well, that's no good see [overlapping voices at 0:07:20.9]... because I... 


COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... People want to, just they grab you or how did they grab you? Supposing I don't know what to do [inaudible at 0:07:25.8]...?


PATIENT: Well, then I wouldn't want to be here, because like I'm here to be with somebody who has some idea of how to try to help me out and otherwise, I don't think therapy makes much sense. I mean, I could do that with anybody out on the street.


COUNSELOR: So it sort of scares you like, and also makes you feel like, "Well, my God, I'm wasting my time and I don't..." [overlapping voices at 0:07:49.0]... 


PATIENT: Well, it's just a waste and...well, and also, (chuckling) it's not going to work, I don't think, because I'm very, very unsure about having to about doing something like this. And so it's going to make me bitter and... 


COUNSELOR: What kind of things would you say to yourself?


PATIENT: What I say to myself?


COUNSELOR: You're saying, "You'll make me feel bitter." But that's a kind of a conclusion you draw from certain kinds of, like sentences you think. Like it's different than, "God damn, you know, what the hell am I..." That's more of the sentences you sort of think, right?


PATIENT: Well, I just sort of sit, say to myself, "This, isn't working, and it's not working because she's letting me down. Because I don't know what to do and I'm helpless and that's why I'm here in the first place."


COUNSELOR: You feeling helpless now?


PATIENT: Right now? (chuckling) Not particularly, as much, I'm still feeling a bit, just a bit [inaudible at 0:08:55.5]... Not so [inaudible]... but maybe that's cool. I mean, maybe I'm not supposed to be totally relaxed [with you.] (ph) I don't know.


COUNSELOR: You're acting like there's something you're supposed to be or [to understand] (ph)?


PATIENT: Yeah, that's another one of my problems. That's one of my problems, worrying about what I'm supposed to do.


COUNSELOR: What do you want to do?


PATIENT: What do I want to do? I don't know. What do I want to do here?


COUNSELOR: Or in, or any place that's better than, worrying about that's better than worrying about what you should do?


PATIENT: Oh, yeah. (chuckling) Well, what I want to do outside is another thing, it's hanging me out there sort of, [you know what I mean?] (ph) And I don't know, which is a problem every morning.


COUNSELOR: You mean to get out of bed and wake up and...?


PATIENT: Yeah, just not really having very much of a course (ph) this year. [0:10:00.7]


COUNSELOR: And so, "What the hell am I getting up for?"


PATIENT: Oh, sort of, I never ask myself that.


COUNSELOR: Well, what do you say to yourself when you wake up?


PATIENT: I just say, "Oh, geeze, I have nothing to do this morning sort of." And so I start fantasizing on what I can do and what few small things I latch onto.


COUNSELOR: Yeah.


PATIENT: [inaudible at 0:10:28.5]... Performing sometimes, people who understand me. I kind of think I owe other people but mainly that they owe me.


COUNSELOR: You make yourself feel this?


PATIENT: Yeah, I'm very good at that.


COUNSELOR: You're feeling glummier (ph)?


PATIENT: No, I'm feeling [inaudible at 0:10:44.4]... Well, what does this mean?


COUNSELOR: When do you feel it?


PATIENT: Oh, just sort of during the day. I don't know why, it just happens. It just leaves sometimes, I mean, without real effort. Like just driving around [inaudible at 0:11:02.9]... and I came back [inaudible]... 


COUNSELOR: And somewhere in the driving you [overlapping voices at 0:11:09.5]... 


PATIENT: Yeah, coming back and I went home and had something to eat and ran around and moved around and for some reason or other just, oh, I was looking forward to this I guess. (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: Okay.


PATIENT: Just disappeared.


COUNSELOR: And then looking forward to this and then it disappeared?


PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I don't know if that's the...where the cause and affect is.


COUNSELOR: Like you're not sure what exactly, but some how in the process of driving around and then coming in and eating and... 


PATIENT: Yeah, I just started doing something and I...that I had something to look forward to...and I was, but anyway, I had something to look forward to more closely. I mean...rather than it, oh, actually I didn't find about this I suppose until like 11, until after I went to work. So, like I didn't hear about it at three (ph).


COUNSELOR: What did you think about it?


PATIENT: What did I think about it? Well, I think it's good. I mean, I was happy to hear about it.


COUNSELOR: Was it, in what tone of happiness?


PATIENT: Oh, it was pretty superficial then, just on a level of, well, I mean, because I was expecting it...because whoever it was, the guy last week said one of The Band's[inaudible at 0:12:28.1]... I forget. It will be coming pretty soon, so it wasn't any big surprise.


COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:12:35.0]... crowd. I hope they get numbers. But it was more kind of what, pleasant or?


PATIENT: Yeah! It was something that I wanted to do. Well, just like...something that you're planning to do and you order, then it comes like actually.


COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I don't know what that kind thing, "Yeah, hey, my recs (ph) here!" Or... 


PATIENT: Oh.


COUNSELOR: "What kind of meeting? I might run to that." It's some sort of a thing, I'm getting a pleasant but there's different, like shades.


PATIENT: Well, it's not that deep a joy... 


COUNSELOR: All right.


PATIENT: ...because I'm, well, I mean, I want to, well, it just isn't, that's all.


COUNSELOR: That's okay.


PATIENT: (chuckling) [And it will pass if I feel well.] (ph) [0:13:15.9]


COUNSELOR: Why don't you give me a [inaudible at 0:13:24.1]... 


PATIENT: I don't know how to explain it. (chuckling) Not much, the same. I mean, I'm still not totally well.


COUNSELOR: Okay, that's what you're not, what are you? You don't have to explain it clearly if it's not clear. Maybe it will get clear when you talk to me about it.


PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know.


COUNSELOR: You know something of what you're feeling? You're no nat (ph) on a wall. [overlapping voices at 0:14:04.4]... 


PATIENT: Yeah, it's just a matter of putting it into words is very, very... 


COUNSELOR: Words, gestures, what?


PATIENT: Well, I mean, here I am. I mean, you can see my gestures.


COUNSELOR: Okay, you're here.


PATIENT: So, well, okay.


COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:14:22.7]... 


PATIENT: Okay, but I mean...so what you want is words?


COUNSELOR: [You cry I get you?] (ph)


PATIENT: And that's much harder to do.


COUNSELOR: Do that a little bit until you can find words.


PATIENT: Just mildly nervous, not...I don't feel deeply one way or the other, deeply upset or deeply happy.


COUNSELOR: [overlapping voices at 0:14:51.2]... You're feeling [inaudible]... you live with this man and maybe I... 


PATIENT: I feel intellectually comfortable about this whole thing. Like, I mean, I think you're going to be good. (chuckling) [inaudible]... 


COUNSELOR: What do you mean by intellectually comfortable? That's such a big thing and what's the feeling, like I'll be good?


PATIENT: I just think that you know, that you're, the way you're handling this thing seems like it's going to be very profitable.


COUNSELOR: And you sort of think to yourself [overlapping voices at 0:15:21.5]... 


PATIENT: Quick 20 minute impression.


COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay. So granted, you might change your mind but right now you're thinking [overlapping voices at 0:15:25.9]... 


PATIENT: You know, that like one of the things I'll say when I discuss this with Jenna and Susan later is [inaudible at 0:15:32.3]... Is that I really thought that you were good.


COUNSELOR: And they'll say, "Hey, she's good."


PATIENT: Yeah, right. So I feel good about that.


COUNSELOR: Yeah, like somebody needs Mike (ph)?


PATIENT: But that's... (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: But that's what?


PATIENT: Well, that's, that. I mean, that I'm feeling more than that.


COUNSELOR: Okay, what is?


PATIENT: Just that we have to get started somewhere and we have to go somewhere [inaudible at 0:16:08.1]... 


COUNSELOR: Haven't we?


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: I mean, does it feel like we have or like we haven't?


PATIENT: Well, (chuckling) that's too, you're early to address something like that.


COUNSELOR: So you're feeling more, like, "I don't know for sure if we've moved or if we're going some place now or not, but she kind of feels like she's good." Is that how you're seeing it?


PATIENT: Pretty much.


COUNSELOR: All right, so change it. Because I'm not going to be right, I just... 


PATIENT: Well, I'm not going to be much righter, see, [overlapping voices at 0:16:43.0]... because it's just words.


COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay, but then we'll, it sort of feels that it, you'll get clear. Like I'm telling you what I've heard or what I get, so that you can say, "No, now he, it's not bad. It's more..." And carry it through this.


PATIENT: Well, it's pretty righteous though because... 


COUNSELOR: You know, like what you do and what you think about this?


PATIENT: [I'm liking you.] (ph)


COUNSELOR: (chuckling) That's feeling.


PATIENT: Okay.


COUNSELOR: Just okay?


PATIENT: [inaudible at 0:17:38.8]... 


COUNSELOR: [You know, treat me like a friend.] (ph) Pleasant, fun, entertaining, good, nice, can be a lot of different... 


PATIENT: Appropriate what to say in front of you?


COUNSELOR: Sure.


PATIENT: Pleasant, fun, entertaining. You know, it's just life going. It's an attempt at communicating your...likeness (ph) of feelings.


COUNSELOR: Are you kind of feeling like...a little play thing and... 


PATIENT: Well, that's a playful thing to do. I like to show myself beautifully too.


COUNSELOR: And not all glummer.


PATIENT: I'm, my glumness is weird. It didn't start happening until a couple of years ago, when I started to grow old (ph). (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: You mean again having that feeling, heavy or glum?


PATIENT: Yeah, just more and more and more, when the things that had satisfied me throughout the first 20 years of my childhood began to not satisfy me much. And I really haven't made anywhere near enough effort to do anything about it.


COUNSELOR: [Still feeling you're just as dazed?] (ph) [0:18:53.5]


PATIENT: So, well, in a sense it's worse, in a sense it's better. It's been better in the sense that I have a much better idea of what's going on and I was realizing that I have problems.


COUNSELOR: Got a label for it and got more of an idea of [overlapping voices at 0:19:13.0]... 


PATIENT: Well, just realizing that...so, that what is happening and what's happening is no good, so it's no good for me, and realizing that I should do something about it.


COUNSELOR: Somehow being able to say, "Hey, this, is bad."


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: "Now come on, let's do something about that." And so more of a handle on it than just being?


PATIENT: Yeah, but and plus see, I can realize more what I'm feeling too, and I can tell when I'm feeling bad and when I'm making myself feel bad.


COUNSELOR: You mean... 


PATIENT: And I can almost see why but I don't know exactly what to do about it, how to get underneath and try to stop these things from happening or to stop talking myself into it. It's a bad state of affairs.


COUNSELOR: Is that detrimental?


PATIENT: Right now? No. No, I haven't felt bad at all about this...I've felt somewhat uncomfortable and I probably will before it's all over with.


COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it's just a very different kind of a feeling it sounds like?


PATIENT: Oh, yeah. I'm not feeling well.


COUNSELOR: It's sort of a [overlapping voices at 0:20:25.3]... light uncomfortable or something.


PATIENT: And I'm not feeling useless. And I'm not feeling, I mean, I really feel positively about this whole thing here. It was just to say that I kind of like the way you're doing it and I think we'll be able to get along. (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: Should be sent (ph) above everything?


PATIENT: I hope so. Are we going to meet once a week?


COUNSELOR: Why?


PATIENT: Well, the only thing is, I was kind of thinking of leaving town in Summer for, at the end of Summer. And also, this, is part of an experiment.


COUNSELOR: Right. Let's see.


PATIENT: So, it's going to have to be something that will have to be reconciled.


COUNSELOR: We were, from what I've understood, supposed to meet 20 times.


PATIENT: Right.


COUNSELOR: And then if you, at that point or something, decided you wanted more therapy, you'd have to, you wouldn't lose your place on the waiting list... 


PATIENT: Right.


COUNSELOR: ...if you've been on the waiting list... 


PATIENT: Right, right.


COUNSELOR: ...for a different therapist.


PATIENT: Right.


COUNSELOR: Now, between now and Summer is probably not 20 weeks.


PATIENT: Right.


COUNSELOR: So that's what you're saying, right?


PATIENT: Right. So, and like...but I do want to get out of town for a while. I just and that's the only, that will be a very good... 


COUNSELOR: Maybe you can back it?


PATIENT: Oh, yeah, I'll be back but I was just wondering in terms of...the experiment... 


COUNSELOR: I don't know what he's doing. I don't know what the experiment is. I just agreed to participate.


PATIENT: Okay. Well, if...if it's bad that I'm gone for four weeks or eight weeks or something, probably just eight weeks, if that's going to fuck up the experiment then... 


COUNSELOR: I don't know.


PATIENT: Okay. But I figured... (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: Let's see, even if you came in twice a week, would that still... 


PATIENT: Oh, that would do it.


COUNSELOR: Would it?


PATIENT: Ten weeks would be a breeze (ph).


COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:22:29.8]... 


PATIENT: Four in March, three in April and three in May.


COUNSELOR: Well, let's see, I'm not coming into the center. Can you get midtown?


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: Okay, then maybe we can find a different day, maybe Friday or something.


PATIENT: Either Wednesday at 3 or Monday at 4 would be cool, something that... 


COUNSELOR: Yeah, Monday at 4 would be fine.


PATIENT: Really? Where at?


COUNSELOR: I'll give you the address.


PATIENT: Do you think that will be all right with the experimenters?


COUNSELOR: I'll check with him.


PATIENT: Yeah, okay. I certainly appreciate it.


COUNSELOR: Here, whoops.


PATIENT: Where do you park around there? Where do you park around there?


COUNSELOR: There's parking on the street in front of the building.


PATIENT: At 4:00 Monday afternoon?


COUNSELOR: There's also a garage... 


PATIENT: Right nearby?


COUNSELOR: ...attached to the building. You can park in the garage and that costs a dollar and a half. There's a park, it's right across from the Train Station and there's parking right there, the big New York Central.


PATIENT: Yeah, right, I remember where it is.


COUNSELOR: And you can also park there, in their lot. And there's parking I think, on some of the streets around there. I don't know.


PATIENT: Okay.


COUNSELOR: I park in my garage, so.


PATIENT: Put it in with the rest of my data. Yeah, that would be good. So I'll get a hold of you between now and then.


COUNSELOR: Okay, I guess, what will I do? I'll leave a message with the receptionist for you and I guess I can probably find out by tomorrow, so I could probably have her have a message for you. And I'll check with Jack Anastisiou (ph) and make sure we've got the okay.


PATIENT: Do you want to keep doing these things at the same time?


COUNSELOR: What do you mean, doing what things?


PATIENT: The 3 on Wednesday? 4:00?


COUNSELOR: Yeah.


PATIENT: Okay.


COUNSELOR: That way you would then be seen twice a week and you'd be finished I guess before you left.


PATIENT: Oh, okay. I don't think I'll be finished but I'll be finished with this, more or less, [until we talk to.] (ph) [0:25:15.4] Continue this when I get back. I think, I mean, that then I'll be happier I think [inaudible]... Maybe I'll be totally happy with me by the time we... (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: It sounds like you kind of like it but it doesn't [overlapping voices at 0:25:34.6]... 


PATIENT: This doesn't... Yeah, it just doesn't sound right...for 28 years of fuck-ups to be fixed in ten weeks. (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: [It may stop.] (ph) [0:25:41.6]


PATIENT: But maybe there aren't 28 years, it was only a few weeks of mess-ups. (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: Why do you feel now? Are you feeling a little jumpy or what?


PATIENT: Well, now that we've settled that, easy to do business, we have to get back into this, plus the other things. Wet back sitting here. My back is sweating.


COUNSELOR: So it's kind of uncomfortable?


PATIENT: Yeah, but it's...it's the same kind of light uncomfortable it was at first. [inaudible at 0:26:21.0]... And here we are smiling at each other [inaudible]... like I mean it's slowly, I mean what I feel [inaudible]... 


COUNSELOR: Like happens when you're quiet?


PATIENT: All kinds of things. I mean, I can, I'm quiet for different reasons. I'm quiet because I'm thinking and [overlapping voices at 0:27:01.5]... 


COUNSELOR: Is that why you were quiet a second ago?


PATIENT: No, I was quiet then because I didn't have anything to say.


COUNSELOR: Didn't have... 


PATIENT: Or didn't want to say anything. Well, what happens here is, I generally look uncomfortable and feel uncomfortable and wait for you to say something. Because I don't really know where to go. [inaudible at 0:27:35.8]... And it's pretty hard to just be quiet and sit in here thinking about some things.


COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, if you're thinking about something then you can talk about it.


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: Unless you don't want to, so?


PATIENT: Well, just, it's hard to get actually started thinking about something else, because I know what's going on here is fairly intense and it's hard to daydream in here. Because it's based on here being what's happened in the past and obviously, it can't be too much after half an hour but I...that thing's spinning and that thing's there and you're there and we're here to do something, and it's not just sitting in the office and daydreaming or something.


COUNSELOR: We're here to talk about what you're feeling.


PATIENT: Well, that isn't really why I'm here. (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: Why are you here?


PATIENT: I mean, I'm here to try to straighten me out.


COUNSELOR: Okay.


PATIENT: Like to try to get me to be happier with me and not be glum (ph). And that the way to do it is to talk about what I'm feeling, then that's all right. That's how you look at it, not how I look at it.


COUNSELOR: Okay, so what do you want straightened?


PATIENT: My thought processes really.


COUNSELOR: Pick one.


PATIENT: Well, one which says, which I keep saying and that...I'm not good enough.


COUNSELOR: You're saying that to yourself [right here] (ph)? [0:29:43.0]


PATIENT: I think so, I'm not sure.


COUNSELOR: Okay.


PATIENT: That's what it comes out as. I end up feeling [overlapping voices at 0:29:47.0]... 


COUNSELOR: Something like, "I'm not a [inaudible at 0:29:48.0]..."?


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: How would you say it?


PATIENT: (chuckling) I don't say it. I mean, it's just down there.


COUNSELOR: I don't know, it's all right, just say it, "It's down there."


PATIENT: Well, I did, didn't I? I'm not good enough. But that isn't really felt like this.


COUNSELOR: How would you say it if you felt it at the same time?


PATIENT: We'll probably have to wait until I feel it. Until I start feeling period. Kind of like that's one thing.


COUNSELOR: Okay. When you say to decide, right?


PATIENT: Well, I just don't feel it right now, so I can't really express how I feel about it.


COUNSELOR: I'm not telling you to talk about it. I'm just saying that it looks like you set it aside.


PATIENT: Also it's kind of hard to intellectualize about these things, about feeling bad. But it, what's really annoying is that when I start to feel bad, I just, rather than, well, I just don't know how really, to just get myself out of it.


COUNSELOR: You really feel stuck?


PATIENT: And I end up saying, "Come on, help me out." And if you don't, then I just..., "Boy, no one's helping me out."


COUNSELOR: Feel like yelling, "Help!" Or something and then... 


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: ...feeling angry that, "God damn it, nobody's helping me."


PATIENT: Right, right. Kind of like, well, I don't want to yell 'help' but I do think that [inaudible at 0:31:26.8]... 


COUNSELOR: You wouldn't want to?


PATIENT: Well, I also feel childish about the whole thing. Like if somebody comes in it's, "Oh, Joe, it's wrong." Then I think, "What am I doing? Why don't I help myself out instead of [inaudible at 0:31:47.2]... So it's a bad thing because there's really no good way out of it, except to get out myself.


COUNSELOR: But wait, whoa, wait a minute. When you say you feel childlike, do you mean sort of silly or do you mean kind of creepy or?


PATIENT: No, very, no, just immature. Just like unable to help myself in the sense that, well just feeling, I don't know. I mean, that's... 


COUNSELOR: Big people don't feel this way like?


PATIENT: It's not a matter of big and little. It's a matter of being able to handle your own emotions better and be less dependent on other people and not needing people to come and pat you on the head. Maybe everybody does it. I don't know.


COUNSELOR: But you sure hate having that feeling of wanting somebody to come and pat you on the head?


PATIENT: Well, it's a funny kind of hate. (chuckling) I mean, it doesn't really feel bad. It's sort of a masochistic pleasure in a way. Well, I don't think it's very, well, I think it's self destructive. Because I think I don't accomplish anything when I'm doing it. I end up feeling bad about it, unless I get out of it myself. And then I end up feeling bad because I was in it in the first place.


COUNSELOR: Well, there's no [inaudible at 0:33:18.7]... to what I feel?


PATIENT: Yeah, right. So the only thing to do is to avoid it happening, maybe, or else just not feel... 


COUNSELOR: Make the rules different.


PATIENT: Make my rules different? Yeah, I got a lot of rules that are bad. My whole life is set up on too many 'shoulds' and... 


COUNSELOR: That you're stuck on?


PATIENT: No, it's not all the time. I mean, I'm confident in a lot of kinds of situations, if I don't get stuck.


COUNSELOR: One hell of a lot more than you think?


PATIENT: But there's just too many times when I'm not and well, there's just too much nothingness out here. I mean, there's too much time when I don't know what I'm doing or where I'm going.


COUNSELOR: What's it like?


PATIENT: (chuckling) Wow, that's a hard one.


COUNSELOR: Is it?


PATIENT: It's very dreamy. It's like in a dream where you don't know where you are, and you don't because, well, I don't because (chuckling) that's how I kind of see it.


COUNSELOR: So you have a kind of a dream like quality?


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: And sort of... 


PATIENT: And it just doesn't feel real.


COUNSELOR: Like if... 


PATIENT: It's not scary.


COUNSELOR: But some how like you're not really there or?


PATIENT: Oh, I'm really there but it's just nowhere and I don't really know where I am and it's, (chuckling) it just doesn't feel real.


COUNSELOR: Okay.


PATIENT: I don't know how often I feel like that.


COUNSELOR: Does this feel real?


PATIENT: Does this feel real? Yeah, this, is very real.


COUNSELOR: All right, so this, is different than that other feeling? And that's, the other one is kind of dreamy? Is it dreamy while you're in it or dreamy afterward, like you might say afterward, "Where the hell have I been for three hours or 15 minutes?"


PATIENT: Generally I realize it when I'm in it. Now once I get out of it, I can intellectualize on it but, so now I can sense the feelings but I'm not feeling it.


COUNSELOR: Sort of has a kind of an unreal, when this sure feels unreal?


PATIENT: Yeah, where am I? What am I doing here I mean? But that, I mean, that doesn't really hurt too much, that just feels strange. What hurts is glumness and just not having too much to look forward to a lot of the time.


COUNSELOR: Lonely?


PATIENT: Yeah, lonely in a way, I'm not really lonely. (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: Nothing to look forward to?


PATIENT: Yeah. I think that's different from being lonely. [0:36:18.4]


COUNSELOR: Yeah, since it's not knowing where you're going or what you... 


PATIENT: I just don't know what I want to do with 40 more years and I haven't really had to think about it up until now or up until a couple of years ago.


COUNSELOR: Yeah.


PATIENT: And it's also frustrating not knowing how to go about handling, how to go about exactly sensing what I feel about what I want to do.


COUNSELOR: Well you've... 


PATIENT: And also feeling lots of invisible constraints...toward this kind of life style or that kind of life style.


COUNSELOR: Oh, so you're saying, "I have some ideas about what I might like to do. I mean I see different things and I go, well maybe I'd kind of like that and then maybe that too." But then you feel like, after you say, "Well, that's sort of appealing, shouldn't do that or I oughtn't to spend my life 40 years that way and that..." [0:37:24.3]


PATIENT: I don't really say that, I just don't do anything. I just end up getting mired down by inertia and just sort of plugging along and not really doing very much new, except graduating. And even then when I do, it's generally under the influence of a friend, sort of getting dragged into something else.


COUNSELOR: [Not being real sure?] (ph) [0:37:45.8]


PATIENT: It's just, it's very deadening. I just talk myself into doing nothing. I mean...maybe I'm saying... 


COUNSELOR: How do you do that?


PATIENT: ..."Well, I'm not good enough to go out and try something new."


COUNSELOR: Are you guessing...when you say, "Maybe I talk myself into feeling..."


PATIENT: Yeah, I'm guessing because I don't really say that and I don't know exactly what I am saying and I don't know the word... 


COUNSELOR: Okay, what does it really feel like?


PATIENT: Well, I'm thinking. It feels frightening in a way. Frightening to go out and just fear of trying something new but not the same kind of fear...real fear that there's a feeling you're standing on top of a cliff or when someone's running at you with a knife or something like that.


COUNSELOR: Okay, so it's different from that but it's a real sense of a kind of fear of doing something [overlapping voices at 0:38:57.6]... 


PATIENT: Fear of something new.


COUNSELOR: Yeah. Can you feel that now?


PATIENT: No. I could maybe if I tried. (chuckling) I don't particularly want to but I also or what, what do you want me to do, feel it and then try to explain what it feels like?


COUNSELOR: Talk about it as you're going there?


PATIENT: Well, I can do it. I mean, it will happen and so why don't we just let it happen and then I'll do it? Because it's sort of, the germ of that is felt when I sit here and we're both quiet and you're not saying anything and I'm not saying anything. And I'm a bit afraid of initiating the thing on my own. A feeling of discomfort, of not being sure of myself.


COUNSELOR: That's only part of it though. It would move or it would change if you said all of it, and if it hasn't then you haven't.


PATIENT: I don't know what you're talking about.


COUNSELOR: (chuckling) I'm talking about feelings that, like when you, there's lots of little parts and edges to them, and when you said all of the different edges, not just a few of them, then the feelings shift and move. Okay?


PATIENT: If you say so. [0:40:27.7]


COUNSELOR: Yeah, I do say so.


PATIENT: Okay. (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: But when I'm quiet here and you're quiet, then you feel that similar kind of feeling, like sort of scared at a new thing?


PATIENT: Well, it's at a point where I have to take the, where someone has to take the initiative, and because to me... 


COUNSELOR: Is it happening now?


PATIENT: Is it happening now? Yeah (ph), if we're talking about it. If it's me that has to take the initiative, either I can feel confident about it or at ease about doing it or I don't. And then there's two ways to add, either I can just feel confident, at ease just sitting here and not saying anything or I can feel uncomfortable about it. And when it happens here, when it's going to happen again here, I'm going to feel uncomfortable about it because I know I'm not going to be quiet because, say other people are talking or because something else is going on and I can just be quiet and pay attention to or because I'm thinking something out because that won't be what I'm doing. It's too pressurized for that.


COUNSELOR: It kind of feels like an impression?


PATIENT: So I'm going to feel like something's got to be going on and what we have to be talking about is related some how, rather than talking. And if...if I don't know what to do, then I'll get to feel jumpy about that.


COUNSELOR: [You wonder about the future here?] (ph) [0:42:17.8]


PATIENT: Well probably I guess. (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: Not now, is what I mean?


PATIENT: Oh. Well, if we keep silent for about 25 seconds, I can do it. For sure I can work myself into it, (chuckling) with no trouble at all. Sort of fear being silent. [silence from 0:42:37.8 to 0:43:06.4] If I could try to beat the whole game I wouldn't [inaudible]... 


COUNSELOR: You've got different moods you can meditate [I guess?] (ph)


PATIENT: What, my problems, my mind?


COUNSELOR: You said you wanted [inaudible at 0:43:23.1]... 


PATIENT: Yeah, well, (chuckling) I don't want to manipulate it. If anything I'd kind of like to be manipulated by another one of my thoughts (ph). [inaudible at 0:43:37.7]... Because I feel a bit exhausted even now (ph).


COUNSELOR: Tired?


PATIENT: Exhausted rather than tired. Just like I've been attending a game (ph) [inaudible at 0:44:07.4]... 


COUNSELOR: Yeah.


PATIENT: [inaudible]... I have faith it will get started again.


COUNSELOR: You mean a feeling like being stopped between us?


PATIENT: Yeah, temporarily, for a minute or so.


COUNSELOR: Have they stopped now?


PATIENT: It's starting again. [inaudible at 0:44:47.1]... 


COUNSELOR: How did you make that happen?


PATIENT: How did I make it happen? Stop, start, which?


COUNSELOR: Start I think?


PATIENT: Well, I didn't make it happen, it just happened.


COUNSELOR: Just happened?


PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, well, it's just you can only talk with other people for a certain amount of time before you just run out of energy and run out of interest for a while and then it slows down. I know things seem to happen.


COUNSELOR: That's how this feels?


PATIENT: Well, yeah. (chuckling) Well, sometimes it will last for 45 minutes before it comes back (ph).


COUNSELOR: Oh.


PATIENT: Sometimes it lasts for ten seconds. But that's how this thing seems to be [inaudible at 0:45:35.9]... I know we can talk pretty steadily and pretty freely for a while and then it sort of runs out of steam for a while.


COUNSELOR: Yeah?


PATIENT: For me anyway.


COUNSELOR: You run out of steam or I run out of steam or what?


PATIENT: Well, the conversation runs out of steam, yeah.


COUNSELOR: So what are you thinking now?


PATIENT: (chuckling) 


COUNSELOR: Okay, you say the conversation runs out of steam, rather than you feel like there isn't anything else you want to say to me?


PATIENT: Well, maybe they both do.


COUNSELOR: [Saying one word?] (ph) [0:46:27.9]


PATIENT: Well, I did. I did say it one way. I mean to say, well, at that moment there wasn't anything I wanted to say or I would have said it. That's [inaudible at 0:46:43.5]... through, just by looking at it. No, it isn't actually, maybe I did want to say something but was afraid of saying it.


COUNSELOR: That's a lot of maybes, [nothing new.] (ph) [0:46:54.5]


PATIENT: Nothing new? Well, there's lots of maybes going on and there's lots of question marks.


COUNSELOR: All right, so you're saying, "I'm thinking lots of different kinds of questions and lots of maybes inside."?


PATIENT: All the time.


COUNSELOR: Oh.


PATIENT: Sixteen hours a day, maybe more than that. I don't know what's going on when I'm sleeping.


COUNSELOR: What are those maybes going on in your head?


PATIENT: Just unsureness about what I'm doing.


COUNSELOR: Can you give me one of them or two of them?


PATIENT: Well, that's so hard.


COUNSELOR: No, you're thinking them 16 hours a day and you can't give two examples?


PATIENT: Yeah, well...it's places [overlapping voices at 0:47:29.4]... 


COUNSELOR: Like right now, what's the maybe going through your head right now?


PATIENT: (chuckling) That just blanks it all out because it forces me to think of something and it's not there. I just feel too tense about it, coming up with the right answer. I mean what... 


COUNSELOR: You feel like you got to come up with the right answer?


PATIENT: Yeah, I do. I just feel like there are certain things I can say which I'm going to feel silly about saying...feel embarrassed about saying.


COUNSELOR: What do I think? Like when you... 


PATIENT: It's not that, it's what I think of me.


COUNSELOR: What do you think of you hearing that come out of your mouth?


PATIENT: I just feel embarrassed sometimes about saying something.


COUNSELOR: Kind of cringe and want to back off and say, "That's not me."


PATIENT: Yeah. Or if it is me, just cringing at it anyway. That's pretty wicked (ph). I'm just not feeling really natural and free about saying that I don't like to say things [inaudible at 0:48:33.6]... meaning.


COUNSELOR: Feel more up tight?


PATIENT: Well, anymore. [inaudible at 0:48:42.5]... 


COUNSELOR: Than you were?


PATIENT: Do I feel more up tight? No!


COUNSELOR: Oh.


PATIENT: I just didn't feel like answering that particular thing, that kind of question, unless there's really something right on my mind there to say, actually go back and pick out something like that.


COUNSELOR: Not even go back on it, grab it as it's coming through.


PATIENT: Well, if there's something coming through maybe I'll say it, but... 


COUNSELOR: You were telling me there's something coming through 16 hours a day.


PATIENT: Well, but...that's some other time, it's not now.


COUNSELOR: Okay. So this, is different, it's not happening here?


PATIENT: (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: Is that what you're saying?


PATIENT: Well, I have lots of uncertainties about what's going on here. Like what's going on here?


COUNSELOR: And what is going on here?


PATIENT: Well, what's going on here? I don't know.


COUNSELOR: Why not?


PATIENT: Well, I know that we're sitting here and talking and finding people to sit around, mainly you're trying to feel me out I suppose, I'm not trying to feel you out though. But I sort of want to find some direction and I don't know exactly how to supply the whole, so I can question it. [inaudible at 0:49:58.0]... got a question about that.


COUNSELOR: Like will there be some direction? Will I supply enough direction so you can move some place? Yeah, no, maybe, what?


PATIENT: [inaudible at 0:50:19.7]... pay any attention.


COUNSELOR: Oh. What were you thinking?


PATIENT: I was just thinking of what I just said I think. Uncertainty about exactly the structure of this thing.


COUNSELOR: Just more specifically?


PATIENT: Yeah, it's more specific than that. [inaudible at 0:51:00.1]... 


COUNSELOR: I'm amazed, huh?


PATIENT: Yeah, briefly. (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: Like being pushed or ?


PATIENT: Well, yeah, right there.


COUNSELOR: And you got really kind of irritated with my pushing? Nothing more specific damn it. (using weird voice)


PATIENT: You know what feels good now, getting out. Back to the old questioning. (chuckling)


COUNSELOR: Sometimes life just goes. Let's see. Today's the 9th. You're Burt Witkower (ph). The 16th is next Monday, then let's see. I'll see you here the 16th at 4 o'clock but, okay now, the next week (ph), there's a little box... 


PATIENT: I've been through this.


COUNSELOR: Oh. So you know where to put this? Okay. What I've done here is, I've put you down for next Monday and I've said that you'll call tomorrow to confirm the appointment on Wednesday.


PATIENT: I'll call you at this number or?


COUNSELOR: Yeah, here because like I didn't put the conference, any number down, I will for you. Okay, so [inaudible 0:53:30.0]... 


PATIENT: I'll call the counseling center tomorrow and make sure I have a phone with you on Wednesday or to see whether I'm here or not?


COUNSELOR: 4862 I guess is the [inaudible at 0:53:44.4]... 


PATIENT: So, I'll be in to see you Monday and Wednesday?


COUNSELOR: And it was 4, right?


PATIENT: Yeah, it was. Let me see. Yeah, that's good. Okay.


COUNSELOR: Bye, bye.


PATIENT: Tootle-loo. [0:54:15.1 - End of Audio]
