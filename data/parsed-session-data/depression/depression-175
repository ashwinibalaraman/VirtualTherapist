BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>PT:</b> I think that's why it was so important for me to find a doctor to begin with.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> It was because people I talk to, they don't know how to express their, or tell me what it is to begin with. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> So, when I come to you, like with the daylight savings time. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> When I watched the View Friday. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't understand that was a clinical thing.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Because [NAME OTHER] has it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And she said she has a home in [DEIDENTIFIED] just for that reason.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And I always thought it was just me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That I just liked it more than other things.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Because if it gets gloomy and rains for like two or three days.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> It's like I wanna hide away in my room.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to be around people.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And since my mother has Alzheimer's,
<b>DR:</b> Yeah
<b>PT:</b> It's a little hard for me to do things like that.
<b>DR:</b> So, sunlight sometimes means something.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yes.
<b>DR:</b> And just like [NAME OTHER] said, you [INAUDIBLE] in [DEIDENTIFIED] and there's more sunlight.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> More days of the year, unlike here.
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> And then of course that's why it's called affective seasonal. 
<b>PT:</b> Seasonal, yeah [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Affective disorder, it's a seasonal depression.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And uh, did she say anything more as to, is it more common in men or women or anything like that?
<b>PT:</b> I think it is in women.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, women, it is more common in women.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And because sometimes you know, they, in women becomes more serious.
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> During their menstrual cycle. 
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And because the sun's...
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm also post menopausal. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> So, I think that has something to do with it too.
<b>DR:</b> That, yeah, and not only, you know, having active periods you know the hormonal change.
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> It's like a, you know, the periods, post menopausal you know, time and all that.
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Have something in common, is hormonal change. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and so since you saw that and you know, looking at the life situations so far that what did you think or what did you learn from all that?
<b>PT:</b> Well that I try to hide too many things.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> I always try to be the one, I've been, see my mothers left us when we were little.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And my father took care of us.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> So, the, everyone says like good job I'm doing taking care of my mother that has Alzheimer's.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And you don't understand, I keep saying to myself.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I gotta tell everybody else.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> My mother married a man with three kids.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> I was five years old. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> My sister four, my brother three.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> So I mean, look at what she did.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That when you look at what she did, what I'm doing is nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You don't understand it's nothing.
<b>DR:</b> The person that you refer to as mother, not your biological mother, 
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.
<b>DR:</b> This is the mother that you.
<b>PT:</b> Raised me.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Exactly, because the other one is just foreign. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I have nothing bad to say about her, I just don't know her to say.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Anything good.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm, yes.
<b>PT:</b> So, I mean and when you're young and everything I'm not judging anyone
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know, that's just the way it is. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and of course, that's how life situations are.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.
<b>DR:</b> That you know-
<b>PT:</b> I'm just so happy I am. I just know she was meant to be my mother. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So.
<b>DR:</b> And, yes, and you know, she fulfilled the role of the mother, she took good care of you.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And now you know, you feel that uh obligation to return that favor.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> And you know.
<b>PT:</b> It's just like things I do are nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Compared to what she did,
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, so.
<b>PT:</b> I mean just nothing, and when people just they praise without knowing and I feel so bad because I keep thinking you have no idea. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'm doing nothing compared to what she's done.
<b>DR:</b> What, yeah, because you know, she, she raised all three of you.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yes.
<b>DR:</b> And...
<b>PT:</b> I feel like no one wanted us but my dad.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And then she just gave us a whole life and family.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm, yes.
<b>PT:</b> So,
<b>DR:</b> And you know, and the, the so called mother that you did not have, she was able to... 
<b>PT:</b> Just made a whole family group.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And I mean.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, when it came to schooling and everything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It just...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and I'm sure that you know, if she was uh in uh, right frame of mind. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah because she never worked, she always held the PTA.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> She said I'm here and not there.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because my children need me the most when they come home from school.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And with their homework and that...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't need to be running out...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Every place else.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I thought, oh.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It felt good.
<b>DR:</b> And I think if she was not, did not have the Alzheimer's she would have been able to say thank you for the, what you are doing, you know. 
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes she does, she doesn't know who I am...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But, she keeps saying I like you.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> I keep going boy, that's...
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. I'm [INAUDIBLE] there, most people don't.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah because you know the [INAUDIBLE], you know one of the few things about Alzheimer's is that they get very paranoid with it, delusional uh, you know, and... 
<b>PT:</b> See, she went through a real rough part of being...
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Real mean and...
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Trying to run away and everything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But that was short term.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Right now she's really going down hill, but she is so pleasant...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And nice and I'm going, thank you God, thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, 
<b>PT:</b> Because she's just as pleasant as she could be and she goes to [DEIDENTIFIED] right across the street.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And down the street a little bit...
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And they said she's just as pleasant as she can be over there.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> So, physically, there's nothing one wrong with her, 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And her mind is just. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah it's you know...
<b>PT:</b> And her sister.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> She has two sisters, her older sister died form it then her um, other sister is in a nursing home and physically she has to use a walker every day.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And here, her mind is just crisp and sharp.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And physically she is falling apart.
<b>DR:</b> That's, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Isn't life just...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah
<b>PT:</b> Strange?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and you know, the cause the some people get you know, effect them physically some get effected you know, mentally and emotionally. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And... 
<b>PT:</b> Because it took me a long time to. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Get...
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> With HIPAA.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You, it takes a long time because my mother had a springing.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Power of attorney. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Which means you have to have two doctors.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Sign. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know, before you can become guardian.
<b>DR:</b> That's true.
<b>PT:</b> And oh my God what I had to go through to do this.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> She was climbing up second stories. 
<b>DR:</b> Mmm.
<b>PT:</b> To get in the house and she locked herself out of that every single day.
<b>DR:</b> Mm.
<b>PT:</b> And I called down town, I'd call everybody. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And they said there's not anything we can do about it...
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> To the point, I was crying and I'd ask police officers and everyone, you're telling me my mother can kill herself before you can help me?
<b>DR:</b> Mm.
<b>PT:</b> And they said, yes.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And I said.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> You've got to be kidding me.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And they said no. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> It's like pass the buck.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Pass the buck.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Pass the buck.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah that...
<b>PT:</b> Because the HIPAA act was so strong, 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah
<b>PT:</b> No one could break it, 'til I had two doctors sign.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> That she was incapable 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Of doing anything.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And you, you have no idea...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> What she was doing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah because you know the, when you know because the doctors have to declare her incompetent. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And... 
<b>PT:</b> I almost went crazy.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I well, actually, I wound up in the hospital... 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> With pneumonia. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Then I got MRSA. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> I couldn't talk...
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Because I had been so upset that I got so run down. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> I almost died twice in there.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And my family they, if you don't believe prayer works, 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Then you just have no faith.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because there was six doctors, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Which is the head of [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> They all shook their head because twice I should've died, 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Twice my family was praying in the church...
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And by the side of my bed.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And twice I didn't die. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And they all just shrugged their shoulders because they said... 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Medically there's no reason why you didn't.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So how you came out of that. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well and I think you know, something that you know, there was still some purpose that you had to fulfill.
<b>PT:</b> See? Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and...
<b>PT:</b> That's why I believe whole heartedly.  
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's why I believe I was here.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> To take care of my mother.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and...
<b>PT:</b> And there's no one else.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, otherwise, how are things going?
<b>PT:</b> Real good, real good, with the time change, uh, remember when I'd come in here and tell you how tired I was?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Now I realize it was that seasonal thing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because I've been so like happy with things from the weekend-
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And after seeing that show I thought...
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> My God, once you realize what something is it's so much easier to take.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah and you know, the mere factor of winter, you know, when people are
<b>PT:</b> You said there's a light or a lamp or.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Something you can buy it, but...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's been gloomy too long.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So I was going to look into that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah there is a light actually it's a bright light.
<b>PT:</b> Bright light?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, which will be about fifty times brighter than all the light bulbs that you know combine in this room. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And what it does it basically it will simulate the amount of sunlight. 
<b>PT:</b> Sunlight.
<b>DR:</b> That you will be getting or something similar to that. Okay, and...
<b>PT:</b> Because I was counting the, I always have to have a lot of light, I was counting the lamps I have just in my living room.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I have five.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I was counting them in my dining room I have four plus.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Oh a lamp, a stand with lights on it
<b>DR:</b> Yeah
<b>PT:</b> And I went I do have to have a lot of light.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah and this is a lot brighter.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, that's what they were saying.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and so that in some people that works very well.
<b>PT:</b> Mmm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> That's another device that you know also has been used it the uh two small magnets and...
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and you know, you, the, made to fit the temple.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> And you know, you can wear it, maybe a cap or something like that, that you know magnets on, some people uh respond to the magnetic field. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Some people respond to the light. And because you know the, some people need light or all the magnets and the medication. 
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> And a few people you know do very well with the medication only. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, 
<b>PT:</b> See, I, I was gonna say, that's what she was saying.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> She said she kept saying oh I'm not depressed, I'm not...
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Depressed and I thought why was I so upset over saying that I'm not depressed. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> It was like you're ashamed to admit things. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Like that's a weakness that you don't want to admit.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I thought...
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Why would I do that if I broke my arm I'd said it. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, some of these things have a little stigma association.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> With that and you know, some people have a tendency to shrug their shoulder as soon as they hear that somebody complains of either physical pain. 
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Or emotional how difficult it is.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm so glad I...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Finally came to you and that I just can't see straight.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because it's just going on in here and... 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Just when I come in here to talk to you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I feel like I can ask you questions.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> I can get things off my chest.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That you know I couldn't ask anyone else.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay and that's of course coming here actually mean. 
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Whenever we talk about treatment and there is medication as with... 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Some therapy. And...
<b>PT:</b> That's what [NAME OTHER] was saying too.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> She said don't let that be a stigma for you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And not that I'm taking everything that...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> A talk show says, it's just that most of the time, when people would say that, they just talk so much about themselves.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Like soap opera. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Instead of giving just... 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Information.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And they give little scenarios of themselves and...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Like, like a soap opera. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And she was giving information like you would read off a pamphlet, 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And have a doctor talk to you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I thought that was so much more educational. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, sometimes you know the what the pamphlets and you know some of those talk show things and other things too, it educated you a little bit. 
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And...
<b>PT:</b> Give you enough information for me to come and ask you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> About it.
<b>DR:</b> And uh, and you will be able to recognize, you know, I have I experience some of that, I you know feel some of that.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And otherwise many times we as uh human beings have, an inhibitory either to minimize or exaggerate.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And there's no you know neutral ground I'm feeling like this,
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and or I'm feeling like this, okay? So, you know, by having those types of information at your finger tips uh you're able to recognize that, oh I felt like that some time ago.
<b>PT:</b> Oh I thought my crying spells would never go away.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Because I try holding them in so much until...
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> There was no one around.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And then I'd cry for so long my eyes were swollen.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'd see people the next day and everything and they'd go what is wrong with your face?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And I'd go what do you mean what's wrong with my face?
<b>DR:</b> All right, so let's see what we can do, anything else you want to tell me?
<b>PT:</b> No sir.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh one thing I did wanna ask you. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'm on vitamin B12
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Am I allowed to have that twice a month?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah you can if you want the shot twice a month that is acceptable. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, or you know if you want to take the pills every day is also acceptable. And it comes in...
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I've had the pills and why they seem not to do anything I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Probably the, you're not absorbing it that well. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Because you know whenever we take uh you know vitamins or certain you know uh nutritional supplements you know especially B12 you know.
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Regular vitamins only about ten or...
<b>PT:</b> See I stopped even taking other vitamins. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because they never seem to do anything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think you're not absorbing you know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And right amount of course what is injected in the muscles, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> The ninety percent is absorbed in the muscle.
<b>PT:</b> I've given them to myself in the stomach.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's the same thing anywhere uh in the body.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and you know ideally a good muscle is the best to for the B12. Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay so in the arm is better?
<b>DR:</b> Even you know the uh the muscles like right here in the...
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And...
<b>PT:</b> That's what I do right here.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and you can you know.
<b>PT:</b> Because I can get a hold of that. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, if you are giving it to yourself you know. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You have to remember that convenient place or you can also give it in the thigh...
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And such a tiny needle...
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You wont feel it and even the B12 basically is a vitamin based found in the muscles. 
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Or the liver. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh okay, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So by giving it...
