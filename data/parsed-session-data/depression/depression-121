BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: Session eight. (inaudible at 0:00:06.2).
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: I'm fine (inaudible at 0:00:06.6).
PATIENT: Okay I guess. I didn't call this number because I'm going to tomorrow. I've been very busy it's the end of the year.
COUNSELOR: Are you hesitant about calling it?
PATIENT: Oh no, no, it's just my mind, there's been a lot of things, and of course, with the grades and stuff.
COUNSELOR: You mean you've been really busy finishing up on the grades?
PATIENT: Yeah, but I do want to call. In fact, I intended to today, the day went by and I didn't and just I'm feeling really paranoid.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. What does that mean?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm really beginning — I decided today that I just couldn't relate — that I just can't — that I don't have any rapport with most other black people.
COUNSELOR: With this...
PATIENT: And I mean my peers.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:40.3) a distance that you feel between you and them?
PATIENT: Yeah. And they don't seem to accept me. All of this sounds like self pity, but I don't know why it's bothering me so much this week. [0:02:00.3]
COUNSELOR: But they don't really — to really consider you one of them or to what (inaudible at 0:02:10.5)?
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Friendly to you or something.
PATIENT: No. Well, you know, I don't have a lot in common with a lot of other people that I know there, but I think that — I don't know, I feel that they don't accept me. I feel that somehow they laugh at me or something.
COUNSELOR: That they're making fun of you. And the feeling sounds like there's something (inaudible at 0:02:38.6) feeling sorry for yourself besides feeling sorry for yourself that (inaudible at 0:02:43.6), but not wanting to feel that way.
PATIENT: No, I don't. I've had this problem for a long time and I've never cared. I really think I'm just — I guess I'm in a bad mood.
COUNSELOR: It sounds like maybe things are getting to you.
PATIENT: Yeah. Because, you know, there are others that I do get along with. You know, I'm sure that you've talked to many people, clients who complain about cliques.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: You know, in school and at work (inaudible at 0:03:39.9).
COUNSELOR: And you're saying that bothers you too?
PATIENT: No, not normally, but...
COUNSELOR: Today?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's bothering me today because I wonder if they're laughing at me, I wonder what they're laughing at. [0:03:52.7]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm (inaudible at 0:03:55.8).
PATIENT: This is wild.
COUNSELOR: But you're feeling very much laughed at by them and pushed out.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Like they're all close together and pushed you out.
PATIENT: Well, yeah, well not every black person in school (inaudible at 0:04:13.4). But then this clique is not accepted by another fact — not the majority of other people. They seem to be a clique of bourgeois, card playing, materialistic. They're not really my friends. I don't know why I'm feeling laughed at by them this week.
COUNSELOR: But you're feeling like they look down on you?
PATIENT: Yes, um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Feel condescending about you?
PATIENT: Um-hmm. But I suppose I've looked down on them too, but I don't show it. I think maybe I do, I don't know. I think it could be that I look down on some of them, not on them as people.
COUNSELOR: But on some of the things (inaudible at 0:05:29.8) this clique.
PATIENT: Well, I suppose I feel — oh, you have a book up there that a friend of mine is reading called, "The Intimate (inaudible at 0:05:40.8)."
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I suppose I feel that they don't understand things that I'm into, and they dare look down on me because I'm not — because they don't — I'm not a part of them or I don't fit. (inaudible at 0:06:02.4) I'm different and I don't live their style.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:06:08.8) they're looking down on you partly because they don't understand you.
PATIENT: No, I'm sure they...
COUNSELOR: The value of certain things that you have.
PATIENT: Yeah. This is something different, we've never talked about this (inaudible at 0:06:37.2) it was bothering me today.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It's just like today you're feeling particularly left out by them.
PATIENT: Now, isn't (inaudible at 0:06:50.6) I don't especially want people in this group as friends, but yet, I feel indignant about their attitude toward me, or what I imagine to be their attitude. [0:07:04.8]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It's not so much like what you really want to have with them.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: What they like to do, go out and have lunch with them. But it's more like it's a feeling you're excluded that makes you feel bad.
PATIENT: Yeah. Well, you know, I've had friends throughout the year that have told me, they said, "The trouble with you is that you want to be accepted by everybody."
COUNSELOR: And so, they said that to you and?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose it's true.
COUNSELOR: But you do feel like you want to be accepted by everyone?
PATIENT: Um-hmm. You know, I was talking to my mother last night on the phone and she was — she mentioned the fact that her children were brought up without any indoctrination. Without any — well, with some moral principles, but not without being pushed very hard to do anything, we have church, but it wasn't enforced. Nothing has been enforced, so she probably sees me as a person who's sort of free. I don't — like, I was explaining to her that I don't have any strong beliefs that would — you know, a group belief. Well, these are my values because I belong to this group, I'm in this set. And that everything that I do, or every value that I have or everything I believe in has to be because I believe in it and not because I believe in this group, or I'm very religious so I accept it. Or I feel very black and I think this is a nice thing to do because it's the black thing to do. Or that I don't want to do that because it's black or because middle class people do this. And I don't know if most people are this way, but I feel very alienated from all kinds of — I think I told you that once before.
COUNSELOR: It's like feeling that there isn't any group that you can belong to and accept value as part of their values.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: And that it makes you feel very kind of all by yourself.
PATIENT: Yeah. And I like that in a way.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. And in a way there is a kind of a freedom to it?
PATIENT: Yeah. I've never felt that if I had to do it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. So, the nice part about it is that it's not forced on you, no pressure.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: But there's also a quality of missing something in that?
PATIENT: Yeah. But it's like not belonging or not being understood by anybody.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Sort of being — you know.
PATIENT: I might have mentioned that to you before.
COUNSELOR: You might have.
PATIENT: I don't remember.
COUNSELOR: I don't think you did, not exactly this way, but I believe you did.
PATIENT: Yeah. And I think I told you that I've met white people that didn't understand me because I didn't seem to be from a culture that they could understand, or that they thought would be a black culture, and blacks feel that I behave white.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. So, it's just like feeling different.
PATIENT: Well, my sister worked at the same school for a while, not as a teacher, but in another capacity. And she fitted in with — most of her friends are black and she told me once that it had been said that I act white, that's the word she used.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And then, of course, I don't know what that means.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But it's a feeling of lacking support, I think, because (inaudible at 0:12:02.2) feel that there's nobody who you can talk about yourself to, who, like, understands you because they're all like you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:12:12.5).
PATIENT: They're all like me.
COUNSELOR: It's a feeling that they don't understand you because they aren't like you.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. You know, it's sort of like growing up and not believing in anything except what I chose for myself out of the environment. [0:12:56.5]
COUNSELOR: But growing up without a system around you.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Like values as a group.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. Black people that I get along with the best are sort of in the same boat.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Maybe to a lesser degree or to the same degree.
COUNSELOR: But the ones you get along with you mean are different from what you think of as black culture the same way you are.
PATIENT: Yes. And the while people I know are those who don't accept the (inaudible at 0:13:58.6) suburbs.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: They have middle class values.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. [inaudible at 0:14:04.5].
PATIENT: Sort of free people, same thing.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Not too white, white, but not too black, black.
PATIENT: Right, right, yeah, that's right. It's a good way to describe it.
COUNSELOR: The grays of the world.
(laughter)
PATIENT: Nondescript.
(laughter)
PATIENT: But, you know, that doesn't mean that we don't see social problems.
COUNSELOR: That doesn't mean (inaudible at 0:14:45.7).
PATIENT: But, you know, of course, I've never — I used to complain all the time, I said I wasn't the social worker type that (inaudible at 0:14:54.6) believe in. I was an individual type. I turned inward more than I look out.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. I don't know quite what you're saying. Are you saying that bothers you a little bit?
PATIENT: No, I don't mind.
COUNSELOR: Okay. You're just saying that's how you are?
PATIENT: Well, I used to feel guilty until I discovered that I probably like people as much as the ones who spout off about those problems.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Because see, I believe in — you know, I — well, I'm part of the social problem, so (inaudible at 0:15:46.1).
(laughter)
PATIENT: You know, I...
COUNSELOR: You live it.
PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm not like — no, what I'm trying to say is that I tend to live in — what you would call introspective.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Which is supposed to be true of people in the arts, they're supposed to be like that.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. And that that's how you are, (inaudible at 0:16:27.5) the focus of your life is.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. And what I like to do, my music.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And my books and my friends.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Your greatest interests aren't with the social world (inaudible at 0:16:45.2).
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Are those people who are going out and changing things in the world. [0:16:47.4]
PATIENT: No. I've been caught up with people who do it. You know, I've been in unions and whatnot.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Well, I don't feel that I'm a leader type anyway.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You're quieter than that or more...
PATIENT: Quieter?
COUNSELOR: Is that what you're saying that you're not the leader type?
PATIENT: No. Well, no, I don't think I could be chairman of any type of caucus.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I couldn't chair a meeting. I wouldn't think of anything like that.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You're not the organizer type.
PATIENT: Yeah. You know, I wanted to ask you, all these tests that I had, that I took pre examination tests, pre therapy tests.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: Is there any way I could know the result of that? What kind of person I am?
COUNSELOR: I'll ask about that, I'm not sure.
PATIENT: Oh.
COUNSELOR: What...
PATIENT: Well, I could be down as psychotic and not know it.
COUNSELOR: I see.
PATIENT: Well, I'm just kidding.
COUNSELOR: Well (inaudible at 0:18:16.5) is it that you're worried what it might show? Why were you wanting to know?
PATIENT: Well, I'm concerned with knowing if I'm neurotic or how neurotic. Or whether I'm just a normal person who's wallowing in self pity or what, I really don't know what I'm like, I have no idea.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Yeah, it's like a lack of information.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: And another part of it you said sounded like wondering, do I deserve to feel sorry for myself? Is it just that...
PATIENT: I'm sure that no one does. [0:19:10.9]
COUNSELOR: Is it just that I feel sorry for myself, and there's really nothing wrong with me?
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Or is it something different than that? Am I really — I don't know what the other part would be. If you were neurotic, that would somehow make you feel different about feeling sorry for yourself?
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: How would that be...
PATIENT: Well, if I'm neurotic I would take a different view of what I feel. Well, for example, if I felt slighted by somebody or I felt hurt, I would tend to think, well, you know, I'm really neurotic anyhow. Perhaps this is all in my mind, this is not really true. I don't know how realistic my view of the world and other people is.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Well, if you found out — okay, so like just real doubt of knowing what to make of what happens to you?
PATIENT: Um-hmm, yeah.
COUNSELOR: If somebody seems to be slighting you, like what does that really mean, are they, aren't they? Are you imagining it?
PATIENT: And if they are, so what.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It's kind of like having no inference of how to look at the world and yourself.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. But, you know, mother and I were also saying that it would seem that my confidence and self esteem is higher than I think, than I imagine. For example, the very fact that I have not gone along with fads or change my style of living or any part of a basic habit to please other people. I've worried about pleasing other people and being accepted. But I've never really made any effort to change.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: You know, what does that mean? Am I stronger than I think?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. And it seems like it means something about being more independent.
PATIENT: Yeah. I feel that I'm not an independent person because I am easily hurt, and I am sensitive, and I feel that I'm not independent. But yet, I don't really try to change (inaudible at 0:21:49.3).
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. And that makes you feel that in some ways you are independent.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. Oh, I talked to you last week about trying to make an impression on a person here or there. But that's very minor compared to the fact that I don't make any basic changes to please in group, or to get in with this crowd or that crowd.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Because, well like, even I knew a man and he said, well, I don't like your hair that way. I probably wouldn't change it, even if I felt that he didn't like me or I'd lose him for it, I don't think I'd really do it. I'd cry and...
COUNSELOR: You'd feel bad.
PATIENT: I'd feel bad, but I think I would stay the same. The only thing that I would change about myself is something that I don't like.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Are you saying that gives you a feeling of validity, the fact that don't change?
PATIENT: It gives me a feeling that I might be basically stronger than I suppose, that may be serve as emotion and sensitivity has made me feel. And plus, my lack of confidence as a woman because of the deformity and not being able to attract men has spilled over. Like mother said, she thinks it has spilled over into everything else. I feel basically inadequate because of this problem. I've let it sort of take over everything and ignoring everything else. [0:23:35.9]
COUNSELOR: You've let it pervade everything.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And you've forgotten about the strength you might have.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I don't know.
COUNSELOR: So what you're doing now is reassessing.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. What do you think? Is that basically true of a person — do you think if a person is weak he tries to change?
COUNSELOR: I think it depends on the person.
PATIENT: So maybe it's not true. Maybe I am dependent.
COUNSELOR: Well now, wait a minute, let's see, why are you asking me if I feel like...
PATIENT: Because I don't know. Well, I appear dependent to some people. I had a friend that said I seem very dependent on what other people think.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I make a big show to people of caring what other people think.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: But what I'm saying is that maybe I don't.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. What I think is, like, everybody is independent in some ways and dependent. And I think what you're doing now is reassessing in what ways you're independent and what ways you're not. What ways you're strong and in what ways you're weak.
PATIENT: Yeah, I guess (inaudible at 0:25:07.1).
COUNSELOR: And feeling your strength more than you have before.
PATIENT: Yes, because even if I feel unaccepted or laughed at, this isn't going to last long.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I'll ask myself — you know, finally I'll say, well, what could they possibly be laughing at me?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I'll probably forget about it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. There's a basic part of you that doesn't get caught up in being laughed at or feeling bad about things.
PATIENT: Um-hmm, yeah. And it's taken me a long time to see it. I'm just beginning to see it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It's like it's been covered up by all these other things.
PATIENT: Well, you know, if you've ever heard that people take on roles that other people put them in — well, some people see me as dependent, shy (inaudible at 0:26:12.1) sensitive, worried about approval. And on the surface of things, I generally felt that I am this way. And friends that I've had feel that I'm this way, so maybe I just play this because I believe that this is what I am. Maybe I have to change that image.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Now you're questioning it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Maybe what you have to do, you're saying, just stop acting that way just because they all think you're that way. [0:26:40.8]
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I have a feeling that there's a little part of you right now surging up from inside and saying, now wait a minute.
PATIENT: Right, yeah.
COUNSELOR: I (inaudible at 0:26:55.7) that weak.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. I think I am emotional though. My first reaction to not being accepted or thinking, or if someone hurts my feelings, of course, you know, what's wrong with me?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: But I think it's on the surface.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But that's how you feel immediately.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: But there's a second reaction which comes more deeply within you.
PATIENT: Because from what I've known of others, people that I thought were stronger, I should have had a nervous breakdown (inaudible at 0:27:43.8). Maybe some people (inaudible at 0:27:47.8). Sometimes I wonder why I haven't had one.
COUNSELOR: Because you've had a lot of pressure (inaudible at 0:27:54.2).
PATIENT: Not because I have tension, worry a lot. I don't know what causes a nervous breakdown.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It makes you feel stronger to feel that you haven't given in to all those pressures and had a nervous breakdown.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah, one time I went bowling, just once and I can't bowl of course, bowl — ball...
COUNSELOR: You can or can't?
PATIENT: It can't and I was with other people who can bowl, not too well, but better than I and I felt that I saw a couple of knowing smiles, sort of laughing at me because I can't bowl, and how I could in my imagination. And it bothered me that they thought it was important that I should know how to bowl, or they thought that it was funny or looked down at me because I wasn't a good bowler. [0:28:56.1]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: But then that didn't last long because I felt, well, so what if I can't bowl.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:29:02.9).
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: That it's not the end of the world if I can't bowl.
PATIENT: Well, that's a trivial example.
COUNSELOR: You're saying it's the kind of thing that bothers you very much sometimes. But then when you look at it later it doesn't bother you.
PATIENT: Oh, another thing mother said she didn't like about me — not like what I do and that's she feels that I — she said, "When you talk you say �I suppose I think.'' She said, "You never come right out and say what you think." She says, "I'm trying to put my finger on what you do that shows lack of confidence." She says, "You should project yourself more positively," which I've been thinking, you know, better to be wrong and positive.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And now, we've both been thinking of this Clemet Stone book called, "Positive Thinking."
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I don't know if that's a gimmick or not, but I've heard it's good. Do you know it?
COUNSELOR: I don't know the book.
PATIENT: You've heard of it?
COUNSELOR: I've heard of it.
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:30:36.1).
COUNSELOR: I don't know anything about the book.
PATIENT: Oh.
COUNSELOR: My general attitude towards books on positive thinking is that it has some value, but you can't really hold on (inaudible at 0:30:54.9) positive thinking.
PATIENT: They have some value.
COUNSELOR: I think that line of thought has some value.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: But I think it — to me personally, (inaudible at 0:31:07.9) I can't run my life according to that (inaudible at 0:31:10.2).
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Sets out too much.
PATIENT: You mean to think positive about yourself all the time?
COUNSELOR: Just for me personally, it becomes too artificial because I don't feel terribly positive about (inaudible at 0:31:31.2).
PATIENT: And you can't all the time, every minute.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:31:33.9).
PATIENT: But I don't think that the best protection that you have against emotional hurt is confidence.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Because I was reading an article and they said that, like, if you don't have inner security, you have no security. Because you can get married, you can lose your husband, you can have children; they can grow up and live away from you.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Or people can be fickle, they can change their attitudes. And if you don't have enough security, you're just prey to the whims, emotions and prejudices of other people.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Well, some people's solution for getting over an emotional hurt like a jilt — being jilted or something, oh, find another boyfriend and (inaudible at 0:32:32.2) you know, I'm not accepting that because...
COUNSELOR: That doesn't solve the problem.
PATIENT: No, it's not solving the problem that the person has.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I know that's an ideal that I'm striving for. That's what I want. I think when I first came to you I told you this is what I want more than anything.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. What you want...
PATIENT: Is self confidence.
COUNSELOR: Is to get strength within yourself and security, so that you can take whatever happens to you in the world.
PATIENT: Yes, at least easier.
COUNSELOR: Right, more easy, don't let it get to you so much because you're still vulnerable.
PATIENT: Sometimes I feel like a football, you know.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I don't want my whole day to depend on whether Joe Blow spoke to me or not.
COUNSELOR: Right, right, and you feel like knocked about by whatever happens to you, going around (inaudible at 0:33:25.2).
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: I guess basically you're happy (inaudible at 0:33:28.8) sad.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: You're shaking a little bit.
PATIENT: I may not change my lifestyle as I told you before, but it's (inaudible at 0:33:49.5) terrible for my mood, my emotions and my appetite.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. (inaudible at 0:33:55.2).
PATIENT: I told you before that, you know, I tend to be thin. I try to keep my weight up and my appetite (inaudible at 0:34:02.7) when I'm in a bad mood. I know that sounds trivial, but I really — most people eat a lot if they're upset (inaudible at 0:34:14.6) an appetite. [0:34:13.0]
COUNSELOR: I understand that because the same thing happens to me.
PATIENT: Yeah, you tend to be thin.
COUNSELOR: I'm thin and when I am very depressed I get thinner.
(laughter)
COUNSELOR: I feel good, I get fat.
PATIENT: You (inaudible at 0:34:22.7), you tend to get thinner?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know, one thing I was thinking about, well, I shouldn't say that (inaudible at 0:35:13.5). Well, sometimes I feel that you are being too nice to me.
COUNSELOR: In what way?
PATIENT: Well, you know — well, I thought maybe if you say, you know, you're feeling sorry for yourself, you know, you really should get out of it. I just hear horrendous stories about people, you know, threaten to leave their psychiatrist or their psychologist because they made them angry, and then told them how awful they were.
COUNSELOR: Because the psychiatrist told the patient how awful (inaudible at 0:35:57.2)?
PATIENT: Yeah, well, or something.
COUNSELOR: And what (inaudible at 0:36:02.3)?
PATIENT: I have a friend who's upset because, well, you know, I don't know what they do or say to them. I don't suppose they offer their opinions.
COUNSELOR: It sounds like you feel like you would like it better if I did that? Or that would seem like...
PATIENT: I don't think...
COUNSELOR: Appropriate? [0:36:27.4]
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. No, because, you know, lately when I leave here, I feel better than when I came in because sometimes just, you know, saying it to you and clarifying and hashing it out helps.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Getting it clear in your mind and just talking about it with somebody?
PATIENT: Um-hmm. I suppose the reason I did ask you for your opinion is that, you know, if you did feel that I was complaining too much...
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. I don't think you'd ask me whether I feel that or not. I don't recall.
PATIENT: But I decided that you wouldn't tell me if you thought that I was.
COUNSELOR: Really? Like, if you think that if I thought you were complaining too much, I would hide that?
PATIENT: You wouldn't tell me.
COUNSELOR: And not tell you that.
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:37:43.6).
COUNSELOR: So, that sounds like you don't trust me to be honest with you.
PATIENT: Oh (inaudible at 0:37:51.1), oh (inaudible at 0:37:52.5).
COUNSELOR: What?
PATIENT: I didn't mean to sound that way.
COUNSELOR: I'm not — that's okay if you don't. You know, I mean, that's alright. But why should you, you don't know me that well?
PATIENT: Well, I do think that I'm complaining. [0:38:14.9]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. And you think you complain too much?
PATIENT: But then on the other hand, of course, in wanting to relate to a man or wanting to be close to one, I don't feel is asking a lot. I mean, I think that's normal.
COUNSELOR: So when it — you feel (inaudible at 0:38:46.8) then it doesn't feel like complaining, it feels like asking or wanting what's reasonable.
PATIENT: Yeah, I think it's — yeah, I think it's (inaudible at 0:38:56.6).
COUNSELOR: So, if I said you were complaining, then you (inaudible at 0:39:01.2) for like defending yourself.
PATIENT: Probably.
COUNSELOR: That's just what you just said sounded like (inaudible at 0:39:06.6).
PATIENT: But then, you know, someone was telling me, why don't you take (inaudible at 0:39:14.9)? Well, why should a man — like, I'm always asking, why doesn't he like me and thinking why shouldn't he? Then someone will say, well, why should he, or why should they like you? And then, you know, I (inaudible at 0:39:33.3) about that. You know, why should a man be attracted to me? But then I think you said once, well, you know, you're a person. You know, you're worth it because you're a person. (inaudible at 0:39:52.2) yes, you're a woman.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. (inaudible at 0:39:58.4) the quality, that's what you're talking about.
PATIENT: If I were to ask myself, okay, I don't attract men, then I would ask myself again, well, why should a man be attracted to me?
COUNSELOR: Why would a man be attracted to me?
PATIENT: Why should...
COUNSELOR: What qualities (inaudible at 0:40:15.4) qualities that I have, or sort of like — or sort of like, these are kind of a — well, somebody should be attracted to me?
PATIENT: Yeah. So who am I to say that someone should be?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Who are you to feel indignant if somebody isn't?
PATIENT: Yes, uh-huh. So, I'm just wondering, what should I say to a person like that? I (inaudible at 0:40:57.3).
COUNSELOR: You mean how...
PATIENT: Well, it's not so much that I feel indignant.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: It's just that — well, I may not understand why I don't feel indignant. I don't feel that one should be attracted to me. I just — I perhaps wonder why or feel bad that they aren't, feel inadequate.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. So that's the part that makes you feel bad when there's nobody attracted to you.
PATIENT: Yeah, well, that's why I started coming.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And if that's the part that you're asking yourself sort of like — this is what you were saying before, I guess like I do feel bad that nobody likes me. Now, is that just feeling sorry for myself?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Or what is that? Is that legitimate? What do I have a right to expect or can I expect?
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Or that...
PATIENT: Well, what do I do with that question? Should I just try to figure it out?
COUNSELOR: What's the question?
PATIENT: Am I expecting too much? Do I have the right?
COUNSELOR: What's happened?
PATIENT: What's happened, I don't know I guess I'm tired.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. But it's like, do I have the right to want somebody to care about me — want some man to care about me? What's the...
PATIENT: Yes, that's why — yeah, that's why I'm (inaudible at 0:43:54.8).
COUNSELOR: I don't know, it's the word "right" I think that's hanging me up. It's like I don't know what you mean by that. I mean, I (inaudible at 0:44:06.6) about that.
PATIENT: Okay. Alright, I'm a woman. Okay. Men and women are attracted to each other. This is normal, this is natural. Okay. If someone is not attracted to me, do — am I complaining because this is not happening to me? Or should I say, okay, this is the way it is, it makes sense. You know, am I asking too much of life? I mean, do I have a right to expect it? (inaudible at 0:44:51.8) that word "right."
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Yes. Well, do I have a right to expect it from life? Well, are you talking about one person liking you or (inaudible at 0:45:00.1)?
PATIENT: One. Somewhere within forty years a person seemingly would find one person that liked me. You know, once in one's lifetime it would seem reasonable.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. So you're saying it does seem reasonable to you. You feel you do have the right to want — at least you're saying, I'm a woman and I can't help wanting that. [0:45:29.2]
PATIENT: Um-hmm. Maybe I can.
COUNSELOR: Oh, I see, that's what you're saying, can I help wanting that? Can I help hoping for that? Should I just accept that it can't happen?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's the question that I came with in the first place, the fact that my life was not taking its normal course, as I said.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And I didn't know how to cope with it. Should I expect it and play the way one would expect losing an arm or a leg or something.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Or should I really work with the problem and try to find out why?
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:46:15.1).
PATIENT: In other words, I didn't know how to handle it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I understand what you said. Let me just say a few things. I think part of the reason — I feel we're getting into a (inaudible at 0:46:23.4) like I'm having trouble responding to you.
PATIENT: Oh.
COUNSELOR: Not because I have mixed feelings about those kinds of things for myself, I think, so I'm having trouble listening, really hearing what you're saying I think. See, I think it's a very hard question because it's saying what about — are you talking about now because you have this deformity? Is that what you're talking about? Do I have to accept men not liking me for that reason?
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: You're not talking about that.
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: You're talking about...
PATIENT: Even if I didn't have one and I was having trouble, I've known girls by the way, who have had this problem.
COUNSELOR: Right, okay. So what you're saying, if I have trouble attracting men, should I accept that, or should I try to work it out and see what I can do about it? [0:47:21.6]
PATIENT: Yes, right, that's what I'm saying. This is what was foremost on my mind.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: When I came to therapy.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Because I didn't know how to handle...
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Why would you accept it?
PATIENT: I would accept it because — well, because it's life, it's just accepting reality the way I accept the deformity, or the way I accept having long fingers, anything.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. So what you're saying, is this the kind of a thing to accept or like having long fingers. Or it's the kind of a thing to push against.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It's like fuzzy, it's hard to know.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. And I'm still miles away from that.
COUNSELOR: You're miles away from knowing.
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:48:30.9).
COUNSELOR: How to feel about it, how to orient yourself, whether to stop trying or keep trying.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. When you said you have mixed feelings, what do you mean?
COUNSELOR: No, I don't think I — I didn't mean to say I have mixed feelings.
PATIENT: Oh.
COUNSELOR: I said I have complicated feelings.
PATIENT: About that sort of thing?
COUNSELOR: About accepting things and (inaudible at 0:49:19.1).
PATIENT: But see, this is where self confidence comes in, if I had self confidence.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: If not attracting men did not affect the way I feel about myself, then I think that would be the — maybe I would be able to accept it. [0:49:42.0]
COUNSELOR: In other words, the clue is not answering — the clue is not getting a man or not getting a man. The clue is how you feel about yourself.
PATIENT: Of course, I know that even if a woman is confident there are other advantages, that there is the — it is nice to be close to a man even if you're un-confident. I mean, the reason for mating or dating or whatever is not just to make you feel good as a woman, it's for the companionship, I realize that.
COUNSELOR: Yes.
PATIENT: But maybe I could — wouldn't need this as much.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. You're saying if you felt good about yourself as a woman to start with.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Then it's like having — attracting a man would have a very different meaning to you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And attracting a man wouldn't be to get to feel good about yourself because you'd already have that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It would be for other reasons.
PATIENT: Of course, maybe I still wouldn't.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, right. But somehow that would change things.
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see what you're...
PATIENT: And I might be moving toward that, I'm not sure. I'm not sure at all.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Well, somehow during therapy, would the therapist ever tell the patient, client that it is making progress or is at the same place? For example, if I had been coming for three years would you say, alright, now I think you're really making progress? I think that you're getting well?
COUNSELOR: Well, let me say something about that. See, when you talk about does the therapist ever do this for clients. And I understand why you're asking it that way because you (inaudible at 0:51:41.6). But I would like the way we do things here to be more like individually set up. Like say, you know, if you want to ask me that then ask me that, like you and me rather than therapist and client. You see what I'm saying?
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: So then we see, then we work it out, it depends.
PATIENT: Do you see me as basically the same way?
COUNSELOR: As?
PATIENT: When I first came in.
COUNSELOR: I'm trying to figure out how I feel about answering that question.
PATIENT: Oh.
COUNSELOR: I guess I don't, no. I don't, but I feel that a lot of the reason maybe that I've gotten to know you better (inaudible at 0:52:41.3). I see you as moving, I feel, but I don't want that to be taken, see, as some kind of pronouncement. That's just my opinion. [0:52:52.3]
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: How do you feel about it?
PATIENT: I think I'm basically moving even though I'm prey to the same — as I told you last week, the same feelings and jealousy. I haven't changed that much, but like I say that I'm changing I think that I'm more aware of strengths and weaknesses that I have.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: But yet, see, emotional responses I think are habits.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I've been reacting — well, let's just take an example. Say a man that you like, that you admire.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: If you're used to feeling jealous when you see him talking to another woman, you might make progress within yourself by saying, well, I'm just as good as another woman, she may have qualities I don't have, but then maybe I have qualities she doesn't have, et cetera, et cetera. But yet, when you see in the same situation and you actually see it, you might have the same emotions. Your response is the same. It seems to take a longer time to actually begin to feel different.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Well, now does that mean...
PATIENT: It's almost — yeah.
COUNSELOR: Go ahead.
PATIENT: It's almost like you reason. It's almost as if you change your thinking about yourself and your thinking about your problems is much quick — it changes faster than...
COUNSELOR: And (inaudible at 0:54:33.2).
PATIENT: Your insight comes quicker than your actual emotional response. That's the last thing to change because that's — it doesn't — you don't — well, I hate to use that word, "internal." I've heard that so much (inaudible at 0:54:51.6).
COUNSELOR: But it doesn't filter through is what you're saying.
PATIENT: You know, when it's the time when it becomes you — when does that point arrive where you don't feel jealous?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And every time this happens you have — now wait a minute, and you have to go through the whole process before you feel better. But I think in your response — I don't know if you understand what I'm saying.
COUNSELOR: I think I understand what you're saying. I don't know if what you're saying is — some people would say that it means I change my thinking, but my feelings down deep haven't really changed. But I don't think that's quite what you're saying. I think you're saying I'm thinking new thoughts about myself. [0:55:46.6]
PATIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: But that doesn't always reach me, a feeling of — that doesn't change how badly I feel often when I'm in the situation.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: And how long is this going to take, you're saying.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. You're still — you're reacting to the similar situations the same way.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Even though maybe your feelings about yourself are changing, or you think they're changing, or you're trying to convince yourself that they're changing.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I think maybe might be basically my thinking has changed, or my behavior has changed, you can even change your behavior.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And have self discipline.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: It doesn't change your feelings, but it doesn't matter. And I just felt that maybe it's a matter of habit. I always respond this way to that situation, though I'm still responding.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. I think it's partly a matter of time, not just as far as seeping through kind of. I think it takes a while to — like you're beginning to think about and beginning to explore things that are just not explored yet.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: And part of it is that.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. Well, you know, I was talking with a friend about self confidence, and we noticed that in our environment — or people that we know. Some people have confidence and some don't. And it's not always related to assets or talents. And we were trying to — we were wondering, well, what makes a person feel important? I don't think you can tell yourself, well, I like poetry and I work for the New York Times, and I have a degree in anthropology and all of this. I feel good about (inaudible at 0:57:58.9). I think you have to feel good about yourself (inaudible at 0:58:04.2).
COUNSELOR: Either way.
PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know if you heard of, you know, Jesse Jackson.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: He (inaudible at 0:58:11.2) Operation Bread Basket and I've heard it. And every time — the first thing he says is that, you know, I am somebody and they all respond. I don't know if you ever heard that, you know, I might be black, but I am somebody, I might be in jail and etcetera. And I think this is part of what I'm thinking about, just because you're you.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: You feel that...
COUNSELOR: You're worth something.
PATIENT: That you're worth something because you're a person. [0:58:41.3]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Oh, it helps to think about what you've accomplished and what talents you might have.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But the center of it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You're feeling worthwhile because you're a person.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. Well, I suppose it comes from childhood or the way people are brought up.
COUNSELOR: This feeling is related to how people have treated you all through your life.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah, now what comes — it's like, I saw a TV drama and somebody was asking a character what comes first, the chicken or the egg? What am I; the way people have responded to me or what I really am? Because you got your first impression of yourself in the way people responded to you.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: So, the thing is, was this assessment true, what people saw in you?
COUNSELOR: I see. (inaudible at 0:59:53.3).
PATIENT: So in the long run, you get your impression of what people thought of you, but — well, if that's the case then confident people have based their opinion of themselves on what other people thought of them, and it doesn't really come from within, or does it (inaudible at 1:00:09.4) oh.
COUNSELOR: Something — let's see, something about that (inaudible at 1:00:24.4). Well, it's a feeling that it's all in your makeup and how you feel about yourself depends a lot on how other people have felt about you in the past.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: You're saying can I feel okay about myself, or do I (inaudible at 1:00:39.0) part of it. It's like, if they thought I'm not worth it, then are they right and I should accept that?
PATIENT: Well, yeah. Well, I think the person who is not confident, who has not had good responses from people — this is the case sometimes with a lot of blacks that are very dark.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Or children that are not attractive. [1:01:04.6]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I think he has a harder job of it because he has to reassess all of that when he grows up.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And he has to form his own opinion.
COUNSELOR: Like free of all the other opinions.
PATIENT: Maybe in the long run the other person is worse off because he's always going to depend on the way people respond. And perhaps the first time someone doesn't approve of him he's gong to be crushed. I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. So maybe if you can fight through that (inaudible at 1:01:35.2) fight free of that, then you'll be stronger because you won't be so dependent on other people's opinions. We have to stop.
PATIENT: Oh yes, of course. But I'll call this man and I'll pay my bill.
COUNSELOR: Sounds like you're feeling guilty about (inaudible at 1:01:50.4).
PATIENT: Yeah. Okay.
COUNSELOR: Next Wednesday at 3:30?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay. That will be fine.
PATIENT: Goodbye.
COUNSELOR: Goodbye.
