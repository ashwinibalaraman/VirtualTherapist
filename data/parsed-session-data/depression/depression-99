BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: I did - I've sort of was. I just wanted to confirm with you.
PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Yeah. No. I didn't.
PATIENT: The last time you left here with a ... so I set you up.
COUNSELOR: I remember that.
PATIENT: Well I tried when you said it I was like - I said a month. So. I get us pretty settled.
COUNSELOR: What were you thinking about then?
PATIENT: Well why was I thinking about that?
COUNSELOR: No. What were you thinking about it?
PATIENT: I'm thinking I set you up. Idea's pretty subtle and either you're mistaken or you're right that I gotta pace all the things I'm doing.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Did it make you feel attacked or ... defensive?
PATIENT: You said just something not very nice on account of ...I feel like I'm pretty straight with you.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Set up sounds like I didn't tell you something - sort of kind of like set you up or tricked you or something. 
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. And - but what did you think that was about? Even that you're probably thinking about it until now a week later.
PATIENT: Oh I haven't been losing sleep over it.
COUNSELOR: Oh course. 
PATIENT: (Inaudible)
COUNSELOR: No. That's not what I meant.
PATIENT: And when I discuss with you this week then. But then (inaudible) today.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. So ... you feel like you did - you didn't want to be doing that and if I'm - I feel that you did that you wouldwant to know why. Do you remember what was said that I - I said to you.
PATIENT: Yeah. I made comments about how I use my time and train well. And you said that would make you feel good that - like you told me at the time and - and I didn't understand that. I thought I told you ... straight forward way to- too straightforward of a way or whatever.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Something that - I don't.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was like you want things to be different and we had also been discussing you want some results now and you were also talking about you want something new. I remember like we were discussing how many over and over and over again and you were kind of like okay this is enough. Let's do something new. And it kind of opened up some - some areas of - of what - of what that means to get away from something.
PATIENT: It opens up - [0:02:51.4]
COUNSELOR: Um, let's see what I wrote. I guess thinks about therapy and what I'm remembering from the last time was this hopelessness that you can't figure yourself out. You want to be figured out. You want to be helped. Can I figure it am I good enough, smart enough? Is this going to work? All the different levels of that ... kind of hopelessness. We related it to one of your presenting problems ... was kind of feeling depressed. You know like a victim. 
PATIENT: How I'm a perfectionist. 
COUNSELOR: I'm going to - I'm going to say like you can't be helped. 
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: And I've kind of given up. You know if you don't - if it doesn't happen or you know. Do you know what I mean?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: What's going on for you right now?
PATIENT: I'm fine. I accept it.
COUNSELOR: What's - but what are you ... can you - can you try to just even this -?
PATIENT: What-I'm on the tread mill. Run the tread mill.
COUNSELOR: So -
PATIENT: Want to discuss this process. I want to be on the tread mill.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm kind of in the process of moving towards the - towards the goal of finishing a marathon. It's the process of walking on the tread mill.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's very boring.
COUNSELOR: It's boring. And is boring bad or good?
PATIENT: Bad.
COUNSELOR: Boring is bad.
PATIENT: It's kind of new.
COUNSELOR: And new is good or bad?
PATIENT: Oh. New is going somewhere.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Going -
PATIENT: New is like new arrival - new you know?
COUNSELOR: Yes. So that's what you feel that's what you want to be happening?
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: New -
PATIENT: Accomplishing something and -
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Accomplishing something. Right. And how do you know if that's happening or not?
PATIENT: When you walk away at the end of a discussion thinking oh. I've got new insight. Oh. I learned something new.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And has that happened before - before for you?
PATIENT: Like what do you mean? Here? 
COUNSELOR: Okay. Here.
PATIENT: Here very little because of my ... unkindly remarks to you.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: In my life all the time.
COUNSELOR: Unkind remarks?
PATIENT: Oh. I said you know - I mean because I want to train.
COUNSELOR: Yes.
PATIENT: So this is the thing I've got in common.
COUNSELOR: Right. You don't want to waste your time. You want to use the time -
PATIENT: Right. Right. Well that's (inaudible) but the relationship as a (inaudible) my life to try and use my time well.
COUNSELOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: I just take time for a relaxation here and there. I do (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: You also said it's very hard going back to your childhood - hard to relax. It's hard to -
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean -
COUNSELOR: Not be doing something productive and -
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Using your time.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Wisely. And in a way that was kind of connecting what was going on here to out there.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Because you feel that. I'm guessing that or is it (inaudible) kind of a pressure to go and do and be productive. [0:06:02.3]
PATIENT: Okay. And especially when it's like that you don't have an open ended thing here.
COUNSELOR: Right. It's time limited.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: So we - so what - is that more pressure?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. It really has like okay then the time limits in this program and so even if let's say like - worst case scenario is actualized and that I don't accomplish anything.
COUNSELOR: Yes.
PATIENT: We just finally run out of run and -
COUNSELOR: What - this - this feels very important?
PATIENT: Really.
COUNSELOR: Um-hum.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: What - when you - when you say you accomplish something, can we begin to kind of get out what that is or get what that means?
PATIENT: Okay. So I am a -
COUNSELOR: It feels important to you and I want to go - 
PATIENT: Okay. So I am a - a thinker, a scholar type, a new understanding knowledge stuff like that is (inaudible) an accomplishment to me.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Or sort of an accomplishment is like I built something.
COUNSELOR: I was talking about accomplishments in here because you want to come in and accomplish something in here and not - it's disappointing and frustrating and -
PATIENT: Right. Like the person who is learning anything new and spends an hour - 10 hours and doesn't feel that they're getting it or -
COUNSELOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Whatever. Feel - I will feel frustrated when I'm in that situation.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And this is similar.
COUNSELOR: So there's like a learning - you think you're supposed to be learning something in here. How come you think that? Could I - did I tell you that?
PATIENT: Well no but the - the (inaudible) that I liked about major therapy is about getting understanding, insight. I mean -
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not (inaudible) as they say.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: I do believe you're doing something here.
COUNSELOR: Right. But do you remember the line where it - it's not intellectual. You can't -
PATIENT: Yeah. Like I told you it's very hard for me.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. So we could then even stop right now and say this is going to be hard.
PATIENT: I told you about the (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: And when you say that's hard for you. Yeah. Okay. And it's -
PATIENT: Very similar.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: There's like no - very little of it could I explain.
COUNSELOR: Now when something's hard for you like this or other things, what - what goes on for you when it's hard and you don't get it and ... there's almost like nothing for you to kind of grasp unto and like you know that's hard?
PATIENT: I'm - I run down by (inaudible). Remember that?
COUNSELOR: Of course.
PATIENT: You have painted.
COUNSELOR: No. I'm - I didn't know that because of why - what the connection was to. I'm asking what's hard and then you're talking about the (inaudible). [0:09:00.0]
PATIENT: Oh. Oh. Because in my life,  I - I came out the - it would come out when I was least involved in study. I never pulled my hair out playing basketball.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I didn't pull my hair out when I was watching TV.
COUNSELOR: When something's hard -
PATIENT: When I'm trying to understand something -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know and -
COUNSELOR: It's kind of -
PATIENT: It's - it's coming with difficulty.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because I started beating myself up. Why - why aren't you getting this? Why aren't you getting it faster?
COUNSELOR: Okay. So some negative consequence - I mean when something is hard and you're not getting it or it's just hard and you're struggling with it. So then we sort of know that it's going to go on in here then. 
PATIENT: A different sense then we - (inaudible) because there I knew what I was trying to accomplish.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And trying to understand this passions in my (inaudible) - this passions in my Christian studies - whatever 
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And it's not going quickly enough so I beat myself up over it. This is a little different. It's just (inaudible). There's no goal to master here.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Which is -
PATIENT: The goal is not even going to be the same.
COUNSELOR: So would you say it's harder?
PATIENT: Well (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: In a different way.
PATIENT: Yeah. It's kind of hard. It's different. Just like whatever. (Inaudible) add to this already.
COUNSELOR: So that begins this theme of like new -we - new territory 
PATIENT: I know. I did - 
COUNSELOR: New material. New is - is good. What - if I'm hearing you correctly and it means accomplishment. And accomplishment is good. And it does seem like it's ... it has an effect in here, right? Because if we have to be afraid of boring or we have to be afraid of the tread mill or be afraid of going over and over and over some place and it doesn't seem like we're going anywhere ... even though we might. And even though it might not be immediately apparent ... puts us in a tough position maybe. Maybe. I don't know. Yeah but -
PATIENT: You're just like covering yourself. Hearing you say that.
COUNSELOR: What do you mean?
PATIENT: When you say maybe.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I - you know starting a profession -
COUNSELOR: What is it - what - what do you mean? Does that - how does that -?
PATIENT: You can have an opinion.
COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.
PATIENT: And I know that ...direction.
COUNSELOR: You'd like me to be more assertive?
PATIENT: Oh. You (inaudible). I - I don't mind if you say in my opinion X rather than my opinion X and then I think maybe.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: You know what I mean?
COUNSELOR: So I'm not making any promises.
PATIENT: Oh. I know that. You say you don't ...
COUNSELOR: Right. 
PATIENT: You're entitled - you're entitled to your opinion. I - you know part - part of - part of it is to try and (inaudible) opinions aside some more and let someone who has more experience - whatever - try and do more of the guiding or whatever and when you do that it lets me you know -
COUNSELOR: I would disagree with that. [0:11:54.6]
PATIENT: Because you don't view yourself as something to teach me.
COUNSELOR: No. I don't know if I - I say when you say you come in here to put your opinions aside I would say come in here to really learn more about your opinions maybe and learn really things you - you're not even aware of underlying your conscious.
PATIENT: Okay. Okay. But -
COUNSELOR: And being able to communicate in a way that you might not be comfortable communicating.
PATIENT: Okay. I just mean as far as saying the agenda of what we are doing (inaudible) time in here.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: I think eight sessions (inaudible) on my mind and -
COUNSELOR: And feeling like we didn't get anywhere.
PATIENT: And then I said okay let me - let you set the agenda in a sense and you've defined - you've set the agenda. You said we are here to (inaudible) and see what comes out as a result of that relationship. The kind of things that come out in there should proof valuable.
COUNSELOR: There's patterns of communicating relating that we're going to discuss things in your life obviously but there are patterns in here that we can be aware we'll relate.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. So about - I that you said that agenda.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. The -
PATIENT: Talking about coming here.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: Want to talk about that event that I was trying to -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Go this ... we probably do this when we came back and something (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: So - so does that - so - are you - go ahead. I'm sorry.
PATIENT: No. I'm sorry. I - I - I'm proud of myself that I can put my agenda aside somewhere and try and follow like with your agenda. (Inaudible) something specific you want to do now because you want to - have go with the flow in here and start to (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Why is that not so (inaudible)?
PATIENT: Because it's kind of (inaudible). Let's just put it that way.
COUNSELOR: Really.
PATIENT: Yes. You didn't say I want to discuss X.
COUNSELOR: If I say I want to help us increase our awareness of what's going on - I am - I am -
PATIENT: (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: It's very uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. (Inaudible). You didn't say let's discuss your father. You didn't say let's discuss that incident and where -
COUNSELOR: Why - why - I'm almost feeling like you're suggesting that your feelings or the things that are not - you're not aware of or just awareness or consciousness in general is not concrete enough.
PATIENT: Once it's made - once you put it out in the open it's already (inaudible) to discuss. I'm saying -
COUNSELOR: I mean like content - like -
PATIENT: Kind of. What we're discussing here today. We're not discussing -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The next - or we're not discussing your father. We're not discussing that event or that issue. We're just flowing.
COUNSELOR: Right. Which was what -?
PATIENT: That would be -
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay. Well I'm - I'm wondering how then do we understand eight sessions of going no where. Of letting you flow with your events in your life.
PATIENT: Well like you asked me before kind of my agenda.
COUNSELOR: Right. Here - the weekly stresses - whatever is going on, things that were important to you -
PATIENT: Because I thought -
COUNSELOR: That you wanted advise or counsel on or a way of understanding.
PATIENT: What I thought - thought it would proof as valuable information and this - the kind you're talking about also (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Yeah. But it doesn't seem like that - that worked.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: For you.
PATIENT: For you either.
COUNSELOR: Right. But we're here for you.
PATIENT: For you either feel like doing what you feel would be -
COUNSELOR: Yeah. But I mean my - my success is whether you benefit at all. [0:14:55.5]
PATIENT: Right. You're saying all the things I told you about - okay and I'm good. Whatever. I don't - I don't feel like it made any difference or helped or I assume you got some - somewhat better but what I was talking but as far as doing what you apparently feel we should be doing here, we aren't' doing that. (Inaudible) we were talking about stuff going on in my life and we weren't (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: We were doing what I wanted to do.
PATIENT: Just trying to flow.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Our interrelationship ... what that feels like for me - to me.
COUNSELOR: Can you say more? What - it - so this is uneasy? Like so we've had two sessions - this is our third sense that you know?
PATIENT: I thought I always came in with an agenda and I thought (inaudible) discuss at any given day.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: I thought that was something that ... that you would want.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: Then I - I think I - I understood and came to understand that's not exactly what you -
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: You would be - productive use of our time here.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: We were (inaudible) use our time. It was rather kind of the flow about interrelating.
COUNSELOR: Yes. To some degree. I don't know if I - I'm with that description but we have the same description sometimes. I assume. And?
PATIENT: So this will -
COUNSELOR: So we did this for eight sessions - something and ... we didn't have any benefit from - the medicine didn't have any - it didn't work, right? And I want to leave. Forget it. So we're - we kind of salvaged something. We tried to communicate and say alright we're going to try something different and we've had two sessions like that or - one since we ... got back together and I'm sensing that you're - you're very frustrated. 
PATIENT: I feel like the ball is in your court now. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If I can come in here and tell you something's bothering me and I hope for that you would give me insight or whatever but I did for the -
COUNSELOR: So I'm feeling then that's enormous pressure but the ball is in -
PATIENT: Well you felt pressure then too.
COUNSELOR: Yeah but the ball is in - but the ball is in my court.
PATIENT: (Inaudible) I want this advice every day so (inaudible) telling you.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: So now it's just okay we're flowing. Now what?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Give me a beer and (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: What if this (inaudible) had this kind of like report right now? Is this okay because this seems like -?
PATIENT: (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Awful lonely. Right. 
PATIENT: (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: You know the moment. I guess what I'm - what - what I'm interested in or curious about in what seems very solid for you is that new equals good, accomplishing something that's concrete equals good and being able to see progress in it - in measurable or tangible or way that whether you're just - can walk out of here and feel like ah-ha, wow I learned something and I completely appreciate that. It's important to you. And not getting those things is disappointing and I don't know. Could - could be - [0:18:09.4]
PATIENT: That's fine.
COUNSELOR: Could you -?
PATIENT: (Inaudible) because I see what you're saying now. You said it before. I've said it before.
COUNSELOR: What's that?
PATIENT: In fact what you just said now. You feel frustrated because you feel you're not making any progress with us. Yu said that line -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Dozens of times.
COUNSELOR: Right. Do you -
PATIENT: I'm trying -
COUNSELOR: Do you feel that relates to things going on in your life? I feel like you've said essentially that in many different ways.
PATIENT: How?
COUNSELOR: You feel - frustrated that you're not making progress in different areas and it's caused you distress and depression and some anxiety. 
PATIENT: Yeah. If in general the feelings not progress causes me to be depressed. Yes.
COUNSELOR: It is.
PATIENT: If that's what you meant to say then the answer is yes.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So -
PATIENT: I have to feel on a daily basis -
COUNSELOR: Yes. Okay. So let's -
PATIENT: That I'm ... growing or something.
COUNSELOR: Right. So let's - let's get then to your issues and to problems that you wrote, that you discussed that are important to you I'm assuming. These feelings right? Not necessarily the progress but also you wrote about feelings of anxiety or depression of feeling like a victim of feeling them. Negative feelings, right? You feeling them in here when we're not accomplishing something and you feel them out there when you're not accomplishing -
PATIENT: I feel a very big difference between (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: What's going on?
PATIENT: I just said I don't see the connection between feelings frustrated by not feeling progress and how that's connected with the issues I've been - I wrote about.
COUNSELOR: The only connection I'm seeing is the fact that you want to accomplish something out there and you're upset that you're not.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Right.
COUNSELOR: And you want to accomplish something in here and you're upset that you're not.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: So -
PATIENT: A positive - okay.
COUNSELOR: So I'm - correct me if I'm wrong but I'm missing something but it seems pretty related but I respect if you don't think so.
PATIENT: No. I don't think so. The things I'm frustrated about out there are let's say I didn't get (inaudible) jobs I would have hoped for. Okay.
COUNSELOR: You didn't accomplish something.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: That's a - that's a quote from in here about this therapy. Something you want to accomplish something. [0:20:57.3]
PATIENT: To me they don't seem similar and I'd like to move on. You've been asking for - we've been talking about this but ...
COUNSELOR: Talk me what's going on. Do you -?
PATIENT: It's more tread mill.
COUNSELOR: It's more - okay. What's - what's the tread mill? Can you - I'm not quite sure I understand that metaphor?
PATIENT: How many times do we say over and over and over and over and over again that I don't feel we're accomplishing something here?
COUNSELOR: How many times have we said it?
PATIENT: Two dozen.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Could you - could you tell me what it feels like to not accomplish something?
PATIENT: Make it 2001 because that's what you're doing now. You stay on that tread mill because I ask you to - before. I'm not trying to - to demonstrate good resistance over here. At least I don't think so. I just tell you that I'm frustrated by the tread mill. You keep pushing back on it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's what it feels like.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like -
PATIENT: It's not like you're even like -
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think you're right. I think I feel like I want you to get - understand some point that I made the point and you - you kind of disagree with it. Yeah. Maybe you're right. I feel like I want to keep pushing some - some message or point that you're not - that I think you're not getting.
PATIENT: Yeah. And this - this point - even if it were true that somehow this is similar to that.
COUNSELOR: Yes.
PATIENT: That we are debating that now.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. What would that mean?
PATIENT: What would it mean?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I felt like it was something about - like I start because I went to point it out that I was looking in a classroom -
COUNSELOR: I could say what I think it means but - but go ahead.
PATIENT: I was looking in the classroom to create (inaudible) closeness with students. I mean I was trying to compensate for lack of closeness with other people I've had in my life or whatever. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I have onsite. I just notice you doing different things. Trying to get close to students. (Inaudible) the classroom.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If this was the kind of (inaudible) - it was worthwhile I'd be - (inaudible) I talked and I came to this insight and he was pleased that I got it and (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: He was pleased that you got it.
PATIENT: Yeah. It's nice working with you. You're picking it up quickly - whatever.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I - I (inaudible). I was.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. He made you feel good.
PATIENT: And (inaudible). So (inaudible) and here I don't know if it's - if it's particularly valuable that's worth spending a lot of time on. [0:23:51.3]
COUNSELOR: So you felt that -
PATIENT: Even if you're right and I'm missing something I just hate it when - [0:23:54.8]
COUNSELOR: Okay. Alright. You know and I think - I think I'm hearing you. I think I wasn't hearing you. Okay. 
PATIENT: Chinese checkers anyone. (Inaudible) Backgammon game.
COUNSELOR: What were you doing there? Where do you want to go?
PATIENT: Okay. The ball is in your court here.
COUNSELOR: The ball is in my court but let's not go here. Let's not stay on that tread mill. Ball is in your court but we can't play basket -
PATIENT: That's a very (inaudible) to that tread mill. Not today. Last week and today. I'm - whatever.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So I mean I feel like I'm sort of caught because if this is our work ... to know what's going on here and make relationships to other things going on in your life and other ways - 
PATIENT: There's no - there's - there's no (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: There's no issue that we're discussing that can be an experiment graph and all these things because we're not. We're just discussing the process. We're not discussing - we're not deal with any reality here.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I just get the sense that dealing with the reality wasn't that helpful for you.
PATIENT: Okay. But we can just discuss pie in the sky.
COUNSELOR: How come?
PATIENT: Why?
COUNSELOR: We can't - we can't - we can't.
PATIENT: Fine.
COUNSELOR: Right? I'm just I'm wondering that when you - when you say well - my frustration in here, my frustration with you Jonathan, my frustration with this person. 
PATIENT: Okay. Right. Okay. No -
COUNSELOR: It's nothing like my frustration out there and they're different and my dissatisfaction - whatever you're feeling in here is not like the feeling out there. When it looks to me there's - there is something but I have to respect that you're saying that it's not. 
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: So I'm wondering if part of your ... issues that you want to talk about have to do with this (inaudible) desire that -
PATIENT: My desire to -
COUNSELOR: To accomplish something - fix - like do something - go, go, go. Not waste time. Like if hypothetically for example wasting time and seeing what happens when we do that. Seeing how you feel. Seeing what comes up when we're wasting time. Doing nothing. [0:26:40.4]
PATIENT: Okay. So you (inaudible). Okay. Fine. Good. You've seen me quite agitated. That's one of the reasons it's hard for me to consider going to professions and stuff like that I don't feel are ... that valuable and ... like what ... no, I just mean that I ... over and over and over idealism. 
COUNSELOR: Over idealism. So it's not just idealism. What - can you - what - what do you mean? About what you -?
PATIENT: (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: About what you can do? Like to contribute and be - do meaningful work?
PATIENT: Um-hum. I have to make some kind of contribution. I suppose it might be in something that (inaudible) ultimate meaning not you -
COUNSELOR: You seem - you seem sad right now to me (inaudible).
PATIENT: No. Just things that (inaudible). You know all the unrealized hopes through that (inaudible) for many years to - to find some place (inaudible) ultimately make full contribution.
COUNSELOR: Right. And that might not happen?
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: That's how I imagine (inaudible).
PATIENT: Right. So -
COUNSELOR: You don't want to feel that.
PATIENT: I'm still working in a - a (inaudible) school setting. I feel like I'm making a contribution.
COUNSELOR: It sounds like it's not - it's not enough. It's not what you really want.
PATIENT: Yeah. Alright but it's something.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And (inaudible) doing that much. 
COUNSELOR: But it's also disappointing.
PATIENT: (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: You're afraid to leave. Yeah. And you don't want to feel that.
PATIENT: To say the obvious yeah.
COUNSELOR: What would happen if you let yourself feel it?
PATIENT: Feel what? Disappointed?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I won't let myself feel that. I felt that for many years. 
COUNSELOR: What happens when you feel that?
PATIENT: Disguised. I'll do something else to - that I feel is also very meaningful. I feel I am doing something meaningful which in my case is the learning.
COUNSELOR: The learning.
PATIENT: To (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Do you do that privately?
PATIENT: That goes (inaudible). [0:30:04.5]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That goes on the outside world are not in my control. [0:30:07.2]
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: But my studies - what I'm learning is in my control.
COUNSELOR: You can push yourself and you can accomplish.
PATIENT: Things which I'm - are not very (inaudible) meaningful.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: (Inaudible) or something like that.
COUNSELOR: Right. Important to be accomplishing something ... even if it's just personally. It's meaningful. I'm just thinking about other things you said about the one thing in some respect from other people. That it's not always enough. For respect from other people and having ... 
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Some power. Acknowledgement of what you can do with your - how smart you are.
PATIENT: And having and we discussed this - almost 19 and a half - the class - from the class and the teacher was supposed to be this high level ... (inaudible) class.
COUNSELOR: And you were noticing it.
PATIENT: And the one day ... (inaudible) and he (inaudible). I came to him after class one time to discuss something - discuss one of those paintings with him. I said - so and so discussed about painting and explain to - having close (inaudible) a thing I discovered in some library in - in St. Petersburg.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I just took something very classical, traditional sort of -
COUNSELOR: Yeah. That was available.
PATIENT: That's what explains this source and he explains what - what the - what this painting really is.
COUNSELOR: You should have known that.
PATIENT: You should have known that and then he - so he says to me yeah, well how about I frame it. I said well how about this? He said yeah he explains that too and I explained it. And he says how about this? I said he explains that too - look and he says well how about this? And his (inaudible) little point. I said I don't want to think about that. Next day we come to class and he's summarizing a topic that he'd been teaching ... and he again reviewed the five opinions and he said (inaudible) the way he had taught them. And he comes to this opinion and ... he - he said it the same way he'd been saying it. He didn't even tell the class that his other classic, (inaudible) - I - right - right there in front of you explains it. He didn't know how to (inaudible) tell the class.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: There's - there's a (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: You - you already spoke to him about this and he didn't -
PATIENT: He didn't have to mention my name - at least tell the class.
COUNSELOR: He didn't take any of it in.
PATIENT: Yes. Tell the guys in class you're talking to. Tell them that you said something.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Tell that to the class. What -?
PATIENT: And what I (inaudible). [0:33:11.1]
COUNSELOR: I'm curious what - what that felt like though. Like first when you told him the first night and he came up with some obscurity.
PATIENT: Well I felt (inaudible) still not clear but that was explained as well and so.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And then the next day when he didn't change his tune at all and then ended up -
PATIENT: (Inaudible) at that point but it feels for me it's like this guy was high level teacher.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And - and he has this honorable position and so on.
COUNSELOR: Yes.
PATIENT: And I - obviously I was looking for a position there but -
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) to them.
PATIENT: Yeah. But yeah, (inaudible) as the years went on I'm saying I can't - I can't help remember this guy and the position he has and -
COUNSELOR: Right. It's not fair.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Why is that funny?
PATIENT: It's simple what you're saying there.
COUNSELOR: Well that's a theme isn't it? That you feel like a victim or this feels like an unfair -
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Intellectually I'm comforted somewhat by the way that it is often the way of the world.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. But it's not real -
PATIENT: Right. It's kind of uncomfortable.
COUNSELOR: Not real comfortable.
PATIENT: Yeah. King Solomon said it to and I'm like okay - some comfort intellectually.
COUNSELOR: Right but not. What would be pretty uncomforting? Not just the intellectual comfort. 
PATIENT: (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: My biggest thing was a position that people recognize.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: Make a living.
COUNSELOR: What's going on? You're (inaudible).
PATIENT: I thought ... I know I'm not alone and many people out there who are far more knowledgeable and capable than many other people out there who have the positions.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. They're passed over.
PATIENT: In my world.
COUNSELOR: And not just your world.
PATIENT: Doctor in a community where I served in Jersey - very capable in many different ways both in goodness and he also was a doctor and ... he had a practice that had 40,000 patients or something. (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: That's usually successful. [0:35:54.8]
PATIENT: Because - (inaudible). We don't wan to ... anyway so he just made a comment one time that (inaudible) and I was so (inaudible). He wasn't even talking bout me. But like that -
COUNSELOR: But that's what you felt like.
PATIENT: Somewhat. I said well (inaudible). I said I know for myself and I know for other people.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Now again I was (inaudible) because I had other people who - everybody was there (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: They're bigger than I am and you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. But why (inaudible) or wondering if you were really are or not and using this kind of - the (inaudible) of whether someone's going to offer you a position or not. It causes you - it sounds like it causes you distress and suffering. 
PATIENT: Oh. He had a position and he has all these (inaudible) who likely have to offer and thing is getting (inaudible). With myself and some people I know who - did not get these positions and like pissed off half the time. So (inaudible) God has his ways and all that but -
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it sounds like it's hard to get pass that.
PATIENT: Very hard.
COUNSELOR: I think it's that ... doesn't seem to (inaudible).
PATIENT: Because (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Really.
PATIENT: Or I haven't had (inaudible) my -
COUNSELOR: What if it's really not - it doesn't exist?
PATIENT: Right. Another reason to be (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Or not. It could be a reason to rejoice.
PATIENT: Why's that?
COUNSELOR: That kind of realization. That doesn't exist. That what you want - what you are - what do you think it would be like might not exist. And you're wanting it, it's the suffering.
PATIENT: (Inaudible) exist.
COUNSELOR: Well just like you said what if it doesn't - what if it's really not out there?
PATIENT: I'm having the sense of it not being available to me.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Out there.
COUNSELOR: Maybe.
PATIENT: People I know are doing -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I think I would like to do.
COUNSELOR: Maybe.
PATIENT: Well not maybe. There are people out there doing the things I like to do. A guy I went to school with is doing it now. (Inaudible) was like just forget about it and put it behind you but then you feel like you're (inaudible) burning your dreams - whatever.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. You can't do that.
PATIENT: You don't want to do that because yeah, maybe you're dreams will come true at some point. Who knows?
COUNSELOR: Oh course. The -
PATIENT: The last time (inaudible)
COUNSELOR: Giving up hope.
PATIENT: Right. I'm giving up hope.
COUNSELOR: That you will have to (inaudible) that hope can cause us a lot of pain.
PATIENT: Right. So I (inaudible) last year and I go and think about going for my (inaudible) position or what the two (inaudible) would be. University and told them briefly -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Tell them this whole story and tell other stories -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I briefly told them how - it had to do with something - I was coming back to the university to assist -
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And teach there. And this guy doesn't know too many presidents and he's known for his - very interpersonal skills and he cares what people more than through this (inaudible) institution and he responded - to - I gave the letter to so and so - a certain vice president and I thought about what (inaudible) wrote in your letter and ... (inaudible) over the years I hope everything's come (inaudible) it's a long shot. But then (inaudible) responded was nice and something -
COUNSELOR: And you felt -
PATIENT: Almost unexpected because (inaudible) about responding.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: (Inaudible) letters - whatever the missing (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:40:13.0]
PATIENT: Whenever you're looking for a position. You know in a world where there's really a feud going on. You know world of religion or how you treat people or something else and that I'm fortunate and you know -
COUNSELOR: How you treat people - the goals not important.
PATIENT: Yeah. Because it's -
COUNSELOR: Yep.
PATIENT: Not too many resumes.
COUNSELOR: Right. But it's not always people don't always treat you with respect or with honesty. It's (inaudible) - you know what to reference.
PATIENT: Well yeah. It's just like this to me (inaudible) the thing I miss the most. In other words forget giving respect because of certain ways. Maybe I - maybe I deserve respect (inaudible). How can it be (inaudible) of - of these - every human being no matter how low and untellable he might be.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And how totally ignorant and - or - I know - can't read and write. I don't know what. They're basically all human beings and -
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: Respond to their phone call.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You don't get that either.
COUNSELOR: You don't get that? You don't get that.
PATIENT: Often.
COUNSELOR: Often. And you can't do anything about that.
PATIENT: And even in the cases where I'm viewing people who I knew. I went to school with him. Hey that's my friend (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: It's worse even in that situation.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Because they - they know you. I mean common courtesy and doesn't happen.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Very -
PATIENT: Too busy.
COUNSELOR: That's - 
PATIENT: I - I don't know where else to go with it. I don't know what to make of it.
COUNSELOR: Well what happens when that happens? How do you feel when it happens?
PATIENT: Terrible.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And there's nothing you can do about it. That's the victim I guess that becomes (inaudible).
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Power -
PATIENT: Not only did I not get offered the job but I didn't get a phone call about (inaudible) job.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. You don't even get called then.
PATIENT: You know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So what are you doing and you hope (inaudible) all make the same mistake and hope that you remember to call back when they call you.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's like take from it.
COUNSELOR: You don't want anyone to feel your feelings.
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: You're hoping things will be different.
PATIENT: But before (inaudible) sent me those e-mails looking for a (inaudible) tutor for a kid. One that lives in my general neighborhood asked me there once or twice.
COUNSELOR: We have about seven minutes left. 
PATIENT: She's disabled and she wanted tutor so I said I wasn't ... I know - I know - I realize I'll probably have to come to you twice a week and all of this.
COUNSELOR: Right. [0:43:06.3]
PATIENT: And if I was to charge you.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: How many times and she didn't write me back. And afterwards you know something? Maybe what I wrote me her was offensive but I said I realize I have to come to you or something of the such but maybe (inaudible) that she's disabled and can't drive her kids. I'd have to come to her.
COUNSELOR: So you realized what - did you go back and read your e-mail?
PATIENT: I - well no. I know. I thought about it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I tried to call before (inaudible) and I sent you an e-mail now - two days ago. I want to apologize. Something sensitive or whatever - insensitive and -
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: (Inaudible) and she wrote me back (inaudible) and she said this is nothing to apologize for. Some I'm thinking like she must have like forgot an e-mail or something because I'm - at the time that was my only explanation of why she wouldn't responded to my e-mail and she had asked for a tutor. I said I'm available and how would she - how much - how was I having to charge and discussing that and she doesn't write me back so I just assumed that I offended her. And now she's like no need to apologize for it. I'm like go back and read my e-mails. (Inaudible) why you were offended then or maybe not. I'm hoping that she wasn't offended. She'd been through enough in her life. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm hoping that indeed she was not offended.
COUNSELOR: Right. But it sounds like you wanted her just to respect you and to say listen I want to hire you or not because -
PATIENT: No. That wasn't - the point was I'm sure my e-mail was - I mean I felt a little bit bad about that. Yeah. But that's not the point I'm focusing on here. What I'm focusing on is that I thought that I had insulted her - offended her.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Being insensitive to someone in that position.
COUNSELOR: That bothered you.
PATIENT: It bothered me a lot - not I mean like I said I should have - I should have apologized two months ago. I finally got around to it.
COUNSELOR: What if you didn't offend her though?
PATIENT: Well like I said I give my assumption thought I - well I might have.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I should have written her two months ago but it wasn't a hard thing to do - to apologize to someone and say -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I - I hope she wasn't offended. I hope that's true. 
COUNSELOR: You're thinking about it. You thought about it.
PATIENT: Well yeah. I thought I'd feel like if I'm overly sensitive to being offended the least I could do is not do that to others.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: About the discussion of the golden rule we were having the other day.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It happened in here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it changes - it affects your behavior. It affects what you do and what you choose to say.
PATIENT: Right. So I know that I'm - I know that my - I don't have a thick skin.
COUNSELOR: And this feelings underneath though too.
PATIENT: Yeah. Very (inaudible) feelings.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. You don't want to hurt somebody.
PATIENT: Right. So I know that I've a think skin myself. I don't come off as thick skinned or things that bounces off of me affect me mostly -
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I have I done anything today that -? [0:45:43.7]
PATIENT: You have (inaudible) to get a little bit annoying (inaudible) tread mill but no you didn't cause my pain.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah. And do you think you'd be able to tell me if I criticized you in a way that -?
PATIENT: I think I've done that.
COUNSELOR: I'm just saying you know just -
PATIENT: I know.
COUNSELOR: Keep on top of it. 
PATIENT: It's hard for me - it - it would be very meaningful and it would be a great accomplishment -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: To figure out why I have such a thin skin or -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know?
COUNSELOR: Right. But I think to do that ... and just going to have to guess is we're going to have to find out what the feelings are too underneath the thin skin.
PATIENT: It's not a mystery. It's not one of these - I'm not one of these - as much as I would like to think of myself as having these subtle, complex emotions far beyond the normal - norm of mortal men -
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: It's not.
COUNSELOR: It's not a mystery why you have a thin skin.
PATIENT: Not a mystery but the emotions are that a mystery.
COUNSELOR: What are the emotions?
PATIENT: Sadness ... being - feeling assaulted and offended. Those are not mysterious emotions.
COUNSELOR: Okay. That doesn't really explain why you're so affected. Why your skin is so thin or you feel deeply or you're hurt?
PATIENT: Right. And (inaudible) I told you if I met some very critical person -
COUNSELOR: Yes. It would just go to the opposite.
PATIENT: The opposite.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because I could be (inaudible) -
COUNSELOR: Or it stops you.
PATIENT: I could do - well (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Well even the 19 and a half story where you - this respected teacher and you're coming in and he's making mistakes.
PATIENT: Yeah. And I do get a certain - yes, it's a certain pleasant of a -
COUNSELOR: Really.
PATIENT: Beating somebody on a one on one or winning an argument when you're right and someone else is wrong
COUNSELOR: When you're right yeah. Yeah.
PATIENT: You know that's part of debating and all that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I enjoy that. 
COUNSELOR: Yes. It's gratifying. Oh course.
PATIENT: You know the certain satisfaction there.
COUNSELOR: And I would not dispute that.
PATIENT: And - well I don't know. You're always very (inaudible) there.
COUNSELOR: Who's winning here?
PATIENT: You don't have to (inaudible) me.
COUNSELOR: Can you say more?
PATIENT: What?
COUNSELOR: Can you say more about it?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like my agenda struck out and I've been trying this agenda that - oh, (inaudible). 
COUNSELOR: I'd like to go back to that for a second but go ahead.
PATIENT: Well I thought ... it's nice to win an argument. Oh yeah since it's so - I couldn't (inaudible) kind of person or clue will just go around putting people down and shutting (inaudible) but (inaudible) -
COUNSELOR: You'd be good at that.
PATIENT: Yeah. But I (inaudible) to do that to me with my thin skin I'm very offended.
COUNSELOR: Yes.
PATIENT: So what I try to do is to -
COUNSELOR: Build (inaudible) be nice, right?
PATIENT: Well I feel that that affection or kind of a little joy playing (inaudible) with the other person when they're wrong about something.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I'll try to do it in a very nice way.
COUNSELOR: But it comes back and it sounds like it bites you.
PATIENT: How's that?
COUNSELOR: Well you don't get the respect you want and the power you want and the positions you want. 
PATIENT: (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Well you have a thin skin so obviously you know if you know you have a thin skin people criticize you and it felt bad. I'm making an assumption here I guess. [0:48:58.2]
PATIENT: Well yeah. That's not - well the school tells you that (inaudible) your classroom says you did x, y - we were wrong.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: So the criticism is hurtful.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I get (inaudible). Yeah.
PATIENT: So it's interesting about how the conversation with the principal (inaudible) school. I said I was thought I was treated very (inaudible) here. I have to just let you and (inaudible) sat down with me and told me well x y has to change and how they wouldn't help you improve those things.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because that didn't happen.
COUNSELOR: Maybe - I'm wondering. We have to stop now but I'm wondering how that conversation could have gone because I feel like we've sort of tried to think well how could things be different and we're arguing or we're ... it's - it's hard. It's hard to have that conversation sometimes. 
PATIENT: Well I -
COUNSELOR: How things are different because they can be - you're doing something wrong. I'm doing something wrong. It's again (inaudible).
PATIENT: Okay. And that's another (inaudible) conversation. (Inaudible) background in counseling and she was very far the best principal in the place.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: Very professional but also - well - well she was - she was (inaudible) person and she knew because of our conversation at one point I became like defensive and she pointed out to me see here you're (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You're getting defensive instead of seeing how maybe you can improve.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I said I know that this part is definitely true but on the other hand if someone had the authority to fire you and they said you did something wrong and the implication there is and we don't - we may want to fire you.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So there is - there are threatening - there is a threat there and you do defend yourself. It's not - it's not just like -
COUNSELOR: Do you?
PATIENT: Well it's not -
COUNSELOR: I mean is that what - is that - but and what happened?
PATIENT: Well she just pointed out. I told her it was unfair criticism. You're telling me I'd like to do some (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) it's like you're saying tell me what I'm doing wrong. Here's what you're doing wrong. That's unfair.
PATIENT: No. The opposite. She said you're doing this wrong and (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: You said it sounded like unfair criticism whatever she said.
PATIENT: To tell - to tell me we're going to use constructive criticism but that's something you have to change. X, Y or Z and (inaudible). But when a criticism is just this is wrong and that's wrong and (inaudible) your file.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Then it feels somewhat like - it's not coming like -
COUNSELOR: So it's the way it's delivered?
PATIENT: Very much. (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: So it's not the content?
PATIENT: Then to feel like they're trying to help you.
COUNSELOR: They just say it differently.
PATIENT: Well say it as you want but if you're saying it that way it doesn't not feel like they're on your side. It doesn't not feel like they're trying to help you.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It just sounds like they're (inaudible) your file (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) so you want them to be helping you. You want them to be looking out for you and helping you get better and grow and learn.
PATIENT: Right. And they'll say oh course this (inaudible) but it's not. That's why - it's going in your file, your record and then it's used against you in - when they decide not to - not to rehire you.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: Whatever. So when this woman said you got defensive and that' (inaudible) well you shouldn't be doing -
COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:51:57.4]
PATIENT: Well I heard it was true. I got overly defensive but I just think that in my own defense it's not like we're having this -
COUNSELOR: But do you see how that's - I mean - that's the (inaudible) because she's pointing out that (inaudible) with how defensive you are and then you feel criticized, defense kicks in and you feel hurt and you get defensive. It's like you're trapped.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: It's a pattern.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: And I think you're right. I think understanding why you have a thin skin and why it hurts so bad and why you want to defend yourself and that impulse. Maybe you're putting a little bit of space in there even if we could put a moment in there to start with between the reaction that we could begin to notice what's going on. That's - that could be one of the things we think about.
PATIENT: Well I do want to (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I can't attack them back because they're your supervisor.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: But you can at least defend yourself and (inaudible) not accurate.
COUNSELOR: Okay. We have to stop for today.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: I - I didn't want to - I just want to touch - I don't know if we could really talk about it but when you said I'm kind of - I don't know. Did you say wiping the floor with you in here?
PATIENT: I was just kidding. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because we were - I mean I would just like to kind of reframe it a little bit and say I think it's us working together.
PATIENT: It was sort of a joke.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay. (Inaudible) for last week also. Right?
PATIENT: (Inaudible) of the -?
COUNSELOR: Research.
PATIENT: Research. Program. Whatever (inaudible).
COUNSELOR: That's fine.
PATIENT: That's fine.
COUNSELOR: Okay. 
PATIENT: I left the tread mill. I hope you don't mind.
COUNSELOR: How did it feel?
PATIENT: It felt good.
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible). Working together?
PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. (Inaudible).
COUNSELOR: See you next week.
