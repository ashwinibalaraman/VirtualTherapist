BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	I hear you still coughing.
<b>PT:</b>	When I'm not at work, I don't cough at all.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	As soon as I get in work and everybody has got perfume, you could not believe the perfume.
<b>DR:</b>	So they're still wearing a lot of perfume—
<b>PT:</b>	Every day.
<b>DR:</b>	Even after the—
<b>PT:</b>	It triggers—
<b>DR:</b>	Doctors asked them to cool it?
<b>PT:</b>	It triggers it, my nose runs and then all day I cough.  When I get home, I clear out, I'm okay—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I didn't cough at all, when I left here last Thursday, I was fine until I got back to work yesterday.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just there's too much in there and my asthma is always fine but it doesn't—
<b>DR:</b>	Those fragrances.
<b>PT:</b>	They're so, and they don't even smell good, you know, and they don't care, they don't care.
<b>DR:</b>	I hope there isn't residual fragrance in here, I don't wear it—
<b>PT:</b>	No, no.
<b>DR:</b>	But other usual people use it—
<b>PT:</b>	It just starts, then I'll be okay for a couple hours because I haven't been smoking, I go out at lunch, I've been leaving, I'm taking a ride and maybe myself leave here but this morning I woke up and the car was dead—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no, what happened?
<b>PT:</b>	It's got to be the battery but I woke up—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	It's 5:30, the damn thing won't start—
<b>DR:</b>	Aggravating.
<b>PT:</b>	I go in and get [NAME OTHER] up, she won't get up and give me a ride to work.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm like, get up, I need a ride, you've got to, she would not get up.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.
<b>PT:</b>	I call [NAME OTHER], he was on his way, luckily he wasn't far, so he turned around and came and got me.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I said to her when she got up, she didn't have to get up till 9 for work but I told her, I said [NAME OTHER], that's it, I'm done, um, I said, you know, I know she's not a morning person but I need a ride to work so she could get up and give me a ride to work—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And she would not get up and this isn't like the first time.  I'm just very angry at her—
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	And I told her that the hamper was going in her room, I will not do her wash anymore.  I said you're going to be [AGE], I have dinner ready every night, no, I said because, you know what, I love her to pieces but if she's going to treat me like that then she's going to have to know that, um, I'm not going to do everything for her.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	I won't, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	It's a give and take.
<b>PT:</b>	Even this weekend, she went camping and she finally called me after 2 days and I said gosh, I just wanted to make sure you got there safely.  I said where is the spare key to your car because I'm going to wash mine and I wanted to surprise you and wash and vacuum yours.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I took both the keys because I didn't want you having them.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.
<b>PT:</b>	Now had my car not worked this weekend—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	But see this is what I try to—
<b>DR:</b>	How weird.
<b>PT:</b>	I never ever like went in any of her things, I have never went through her drawers, I have never touched, you know what I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	It's amazing.
<b>PT:</b>	I never went in anything private of [NAME OTHER]
<b>DR:</b>	Did you ask her what she meant by that, that she didn't want you to have a key?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, she gets mad because if, if her car door is open, I take the trash out of it.
<b>DR:</b>	And why does she not like you taking the trash out?  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Because it's hers but I do it.
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Oh man.
<b>PT:</b>	Cups and papers and my car has nothing and it drives me nuts and I think that's her 1 little piece of mom can't get it.
<b>DR:</b>	Ha, I think you're probably right about that.
<b>PT:</b>	And in her mind, that's 1 thing that she has control over is she can have her car as dirty as she wants and she knows it drives me absolutely nuts.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	I was going to vacuum it real nice for her and then I thought to myself, then she's like, well you can do the outside and I said, no, you know what [NAME OTHER], I'm not going to do this car anymore.  She's had it almost a year and she's never washed it.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I've always washed it.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Because if I'm washing my car, I wash her car.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I wash my car all the time.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Then I thought, you know, you're an idiot [PATIENT NAME], just no, if she wants to drive around and have dirty windows, then that, all right, do it.  I didn't do much of anything this weekend.  I never ended up, I didn't go to the service, I couldn't, I didn't go to church Sunday because I just couldn't.
<b>DR:</b>	Does it hurt to be around other people?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm finding that more and more lately, um, even the [INAUDIBLE].  I am completely, I know [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] thinks something is up because I totally, we always talk, [INAUDIBLE], I don't want to [INAUDIBLE] anything with him, I don't, I don't care anymore to express anything, you know, I don't, after I left here Thursday, like I said, I, uh, by the time Friday came, you know, I did pick up the Seroquel again, so I felt calm but more, Saturday alone, I felt more of an eerie calm, like I felt that calm and I was like, um, you know, I had my thoughts again, I just, I just want to go to sleep [INAUDIBLE] and I would [INAUDIBLE] but I did just, I was really calm about it, it was very calm to me—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	You know—
<b>DR:</b>	Not exactly suicidal but you could watch—
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Too calm.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], no, so that's—
<b>DR:</b>	That's worrisome, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It was too calm for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It was too, it wasn't like I wasn't saying to myself, I'm going to jump on a train but if I sit up just a while, who knows—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I was very calm about that thought, you know, like I'm just, um, did look up another support group and I thought, nah, I don't want to [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	So you looked up a support group, that's good.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but—
<b>DR:</b>	At least you know it's out there.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, even if now is not exactly the time.
<b>PT:</b>	I, you know, I just feel like I alienate myself completely and I don't want to deal with people, um, I haven't talked to my mom but then again mom makes no effort either unless she needs a ride to call me.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I didn't go to swimming stuff like I said.  I do love to watch my nephew swim but I didn't not want to be anywhere near [NAME OTHER]
<b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, I think that was wise to avoid your brother.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he would have started something.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	He always starts.
<b>DR:</b>	He doesn't seem to be able to help himself and already you weren't feeling that comfortable around people.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I, I'm, I [INAUDIBLE] like that, I wish I could just never leave the house, I really, you know, I mean I should feel like, I mean I'm so unsocial, um, [INAUDIBLE] call me, a friend wants to take me out, I don't know why people don't understand, I don't want to go out with anybody right now.
<b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.
<b>PT:</b>	You need a man, a man, no, a man will not fix me, a man is not my solution, that's more trouble than it's worth right now for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't have the [INAUDIBLE] to listen to someone, it might sound selfish but I don't have the energy to deal with someone else right now.
<b>DR:</b>	Well sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Good or bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Good or bad.  I don't know if I ever want a relationship with a man again.
<b>DR:</b>	And there's no law that says you have to have one.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], if you got a man that would, no, that won't solve my problems, that doesn't solve things, you know, the same things will always be there even if I'm dating a person.  I pay my own bills, I don't expect anyone else to pay my bills.  Um, I, I depend on myself, I don't want to depend on anyone ever ever again.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, I don't blame you, a lot of people have let you down.
<b>PT:</b>	Even if I ever have a relationship, I'll have my own bank account, I will never not have money in the bank.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't blame you.
<b>PT:</b>	Ever.  And I can't get past that.
<b>DR:</b>	And the right person will respect that, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	I just don't think I'll ever, um, it's, I can't do it anymore, it's just getting easier and easier to want to die.  [INAUDIBLE].  My mother, I mean I love my mother but sometimes I hate her.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well it's understandable, she really didn't stand up for you the way a parent ought to.
<b>PT:</b>	She just doesn't care, she just doesn't care.  I feel like I had my kids and I love my kids but I feel like  I'm completely alone, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	I think other mothers understand, most other mothers, I think the thing about your mother, in her own strange way she cares but her own selfishness is so deep that she missed that connection, I don't think she has that connection with any of her children.  She has some that she puts up on a pedestal like [NAME OTHER]
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she loves [NAME OTHER], exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	But look at who [NAME OTHER] is, he's a chip off the old block, he doesn't see anybody but [NAME OTHER], you know?
<b>PT:</b>	It's just mean.
<b>DR:</b>	And you're in a tough spot because—
<b>PT:</b>	I can't up though, I can't get here, I can't get past the middle to, you know, to feel good, I'm like, I can't, I used to always be able to deal with things or at least have some control and now I, I can't get to that point where I am in charge completely, you know, and that really bothers me.  I am a controlling person, I am a know it all person, my kids tell me that every day.  Yes, I can be like that, very opinionated, yes, yes.
<b>DR:</b>	But you're good at what you do and you're good at figuring out what needs to be done and you're good at saying this is my sphere, my job, my home, and then the hardest thing as you get older is you have had so many losses recently and it is mind boggling, you're still in bereavement.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, my cousin [NAME OTHER] went to get a scan Friday and it was bad news but then she got another scan yesterday and now they're not sure.  She's the one who just had the double mastectomy.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	But we're hoping—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, I am too.
<b>PT:</b>	We're hoping because she's the one who just lost her sister and I lost my cousin, her brother, he died of Ewing's sarcoma when he was [AGE]
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] was only [AGE] and I'm worried because my ankle has been hurting for months and I'm afraid because that's where his cancer started.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my.
<b>PT:</b>	No, that's where it started in the bone.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	[AGE].  He lost his leg when he was [AGE]
<b>DR:</b>	Ewing's sarcoma, wow.
<b>PT:</b>	This is my mom's sister's kids.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And then [NAME OTHER] got the [INAUDIBLE] sarcoma.
<b>DR:</b>	Good grief.
<b>PT:</b>	And got the breast, my mom's sister died of breast cancer—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And my uncle [NAME OTHER] died of throat cancer.
<b>DR:</b>	And you've had melanoma.
<b>PT:</b>	And melanoma and then my cousin [NAME OTHER] who's my mom's brother's just died of cancer.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	So our family is one big—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] gets on my nerves, she's like, oh, how you doing, [INAUDIBLE].  Well, I'm not happy about it, it still bothers me but I'm waiting till lunch.  Uh, well, you need to quit, I said you know what, I know what I need to do but people look at smokers like they're criminals and we're not, um, and you know what, I'm going to die from cancer, I mean I am going to die from cancer and that's the way it is.  If I don't get hit by a big truck or I don't kill myself first, I'm going to die from cancer.  Everybody has it, that's how everybody dies and I don't care what anyone says to tell me that I'm going to die from it.  I might not be from melanoma, it might be lung, it might be brain, anybody dies of cancer.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	They do though, they do.
<b>DR:</b>	A lot of people in your family have.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean my dad, he ended up with the liver cancer that they couldn't find.
<b>DR:</b>	They couldn't find it?
<b>PT:</b>	When he went in the hospital, he was [AGE], he went in for pneumonia and then until he died they still didn't know, he had a fever, they couldn't get rid of it and then they autopsied his liver and found the cancer.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	But it was, you couldn't see it with tests and he kept losing weight, losing weight—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my word,
<b>PT:</b>	Getting jaundice, we knew something was wrong.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	By the time he died, my dad was like 85 pounds if that and it was horrible from January to March to watch this, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, it must have been awful.
<b>PT:</b>	It was, it was horrible, you know and then everybody, you know, just dies from it and I'm thinking I don't know if just tell me in my mind it's better just to get out now because I don't want to suffer like everybody I've watched suffer, I don't want that for me.  If I have cancer again, I'm not doing any treatment, I'm just going because certain kind of cancers, I don't care what they said, they can't fix it, once it's gone around and that host has taken off, you're done and people are like oh, no, no, you're done.  I mean every time [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I don't have to see you anymore, you're done.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Because [NAME OTHER] in our office too, her mom had her picture in the paper Sunday, it would have been her [AGE] birthday—
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	And when [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] told her you're done, you're done and she told my cousin [NAME OTHER] you're done.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	They're done.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	I don't know how [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] does it.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't either.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't think I could handle it.
<b>PT:</b>	I couldn't, no, I couldn't, I couldn't, no, but I mean I'm hoping that, um, [NAME OTHER]'s comes back and she's had the bone scan, that it's not something showing up.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because she just got [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And my aunt had that for years she suffered and tried to beat it.  That's what I was saying to my mother, geez mom, you've got so much and a friend, the one from Florida that's a little crazy, she's mad at her and she's mad at my mom now so she hasn't called either of us.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.
<b>PT:</b>	But that's okay—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because that's okay and my mom's like, I said mom, it's okay, she will come around—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	When she's ready to.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, what's she mad about, do you know?
<b>PT:</b>	She wanted my mom to go visit her but that's when my cousin [NAME OTHER] was dying—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	And my mom told her that—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And she didn't want, she wanted my mom to come and that's part of her illness though, she's—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I told my mother, she's just got some mental issues.
<b>DR:</b>	She does, you're right.
<b>PT:</b>	My mother doesn't have any, um, like [NAME OTHER], don't worry about him because we had a talk the night and I told him he had to get his old job back if he couldn't get a new one—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Because he had to get out of house, he has not left the house.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	He won't leave the house.  He hates people and he'll tell you that.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] I feel so bad, that's one thing he has, none of them have OCD, none of them, they're complete pigs which is okay but he is very much, um, he does not like people.  He has some friends but he doesn't hang out with them, um, [NAME OTHER] tries to get him out and they go lifting together.
<b>DR:</b>	That's great.
<b>PT:</b>	But he won't leave the house otherwise.  If [NAME OTHER] doesn't come and get him, he won't leave.  I told him that he has to face the world.
<b>DR:</b>	He's a smart young man, could a shift at the post office suit him, would it be like, you know, the later shifts where people work on their own.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, Home Depot has like a night shift, the warehouse, and I said to him why don't you apply, we'll get you there.  No, I don't want to and I said but—
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	You need to do it.  He's very fearful of the outside.
<b>DR:</b>	So he is too.
<b>PT:</b>	Very much and see, the thing is I can understand those fears completely—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm very patient with him but other people, like especially my family, my sisters and my brothers, I really got angry like I said because the other day [NAME OTHER], I called my brother [NAME OTHER] and I said to him, can I have $40, you know, I'm desperate.  To make a long story short, he ended up giving it to me but they always want a written explanation for it.  I wouldn't ask you for it if I didn't need it.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm buying bread and milk and lunchmeat but they should trust me enough to know that, and right away they're, well why can't [NAME OTHER] help you.  Because if they could, they would have—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, and then right away they're like, well [NAME OTHER] don't do anything, um, he's not even going to college, um, and I'm, they don't understand [NAME OTHER] and I do.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And I have to push him a little bit at a time, not too much—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because, God he's so much like me in that way and he was such a happy little kid but after the divorce, he changed, completely.  My [NAME OTHER] was the easiest going smiling little guy you'd ever want to meet and he just built up this anger and, um, life circumstances changed him and I'm trying to be really patient with him but, um—
<b>DR:</b>	You've got to follow your instinct with that, you're the only one who [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	My family, yeah, they're just so, they're so [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well, they're very judgmental, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, you know, he's looking a little fat again.  I know what my son looks like, I don't need that.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Oh and he's lifting with [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and [NAME OTHER] knows that, nobody knows more than the person himself—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	What they have to change.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	And the more that you pressure that person, the more they're going to push you away.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And like [INAUDIBLE], maybe I was just angry because like I said, when I did ask my mom, you know how she, you know, wouldn't respond and then, like I said, I wasn't going to call [NAME OTHER] but Saturday [INAUDIBLE], I really was hungry, I hadn't eaten—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.
<b>PT:</b>	In a couple days and I said to myself, if I keep taking the medicine, I've got to get something to eat.
<b>DR:</b>	You do.
<b>PT:</b>	I woke up Saturday morning crying to myself and then I was like, okay, okay, you know, you've got to do it, you've got to call him and, you know, hours have passed, he didn't call back, um, the thing is it was like, I mean he gave it to me but they can't just give me it, they always have to make me feel, you know, I even feel worse about myself when I end up taking it, you know, and [INAUDIBLE].  I can't do this the rest of my life, like I try, I [INAUDIBLE] my job but I'm not living the rest of my life like this.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know how to fix it, I don't know how to fix anything, um, and I think that's why I got so bad that I cut last week, I just, I could not stop, the more I, the deeper the better and that's just, my mind was like, no, that's not enough so just, and I had to hurt myself and I mean afterwards I'm like, but at the time—
<b>DR:</b>	It just takes over I think.
<b>PT:</b>	I just have to do it, I have to, [INAUDIBLE], I've got almost [INAUDIBLE] and I don't care where I do it, I have to do it when I have to do it and sometimes it's deeper, sometimes there's more slices, it's just depends on what's going on here and how angry I am and but I just, I thought to myself, I can't [INAUDIBLE].  I'm either going to come out of this okay or I'm going to be dead and that's, there's no other solution, that's, I won't live like this for the rest of my life because I'm not living.  If this is what life is, I don't want it.  I know that sounds horrible, selfish and it does, I know it does, [INAUDIBLE] anything to have another tomorrow, I know that.  Sometimes the mind is just, you're in pain and you just can't get rid of it, it doesn't stop, you know, and it just doesn't stop.
<b>DR:</b>	You are living in a lot of pain, physical and psychic.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and they're not, I just feel like [INAUDIBLE] all the goodness is gone, there's just no, um, and I know if I try to hang in there, some day it'll be back with my grand kids but it's been so long that I can't relate to that all the time, like I can't see it.
<b>DR:</b>	It must seem like very delayed gratification, you know.  I keep being encouraged when I think of you going to the beach and appreciating that it was beautiful, even if it's just a glimpse, even if once a week you just have a glimpse of something beautiful or calming, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean like I said, when the Seroquel, I just take the 50 and cut it 4 times, I probably could take 25 and instead of 12.
<b>DR:</b>	I think you could, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I know I'm okay with it—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	But I mean I knew, like I said, that Thursday when I got home, the first thing I did was took a piece of it.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm glad.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I couldn't, I mean it, I mean it just, I don't know what happened, I can only describe it, like I said, like a racetrack and there's no flag for people to slow down and it just keeps going and going and the [INAUDIBLE] is just, I just couldn't, you know, everybody is talking and it's just louder and it's like, you know how like Charlie Brown is?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not hearing them but I'm hearing the sound like just, just like [INAUDIBLE] are you coming back.  No, no, I'm not coming back, no, no, no, and my talking was really, and I physically wasn't feeling good, um, I don't know, my balance has been really bad the last couple days.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	My left arm has been killing me.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh-uh.
<b>PT:</b>	Just won't stop again.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I have like I, you know, just banged and twist and I don't know, I don't know if it's just being active again or if the medicine is helping it.  I'm only in the 3rd week so it's kind of, it's too soon.
<b>DR:</b>	You could still be having Herxheimer's reactions too which is where it's attacking that area, the medicine is attacking that area and the toxins are being released so you feel an even more intense sensation.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean I just physically too didn't feel good and it was good I stayed home Friday because I still did not feel good.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, just didn't feel like, and I mean I guess it's a good thing that [NAME OTHER] is home because like I said Friday, was it Thursday or Friday, I just gathered up all my pills and I'm like what the hell would happen if I took them all.  With my luck, would I be in a coma or would I be dead because I don't want to wake up if I take them, you know, I don't want to wake up to anybody and I'm just looking at them all and I'm like, you know, and [NAME OTHER] is home and I often think well it's a good thing [NAME OTHER] is home, maybe God has him like that for a reason.
<b>DR:</b>	It could be, you may be right.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, because I could never have my [NAME OTHER] find me and I don't think taking pills is as easy as people think it is.
<b>DR:</b>	No, it's unpredictable, what it's going to do.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah and like I always said, I don't want to be one of them people that wake up.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, so I guess no way is it 100% effective [INAUDIBLE].  I'd like to just do it the right way and I kept thinking of [NAME OTHER] and I'm like all right and I pushed everything back.
<b>DR:</b>	Good for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I have so many things I could mix and match—
<b>DR:</b>	I know you do.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know what the hell they would do, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But I didn't, you know, and like I said, I just keep trying every day to tell myself, just [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	When I woke up this morning with that car alarm.
<b>DR:</b>	Aw.  That's the last thing you need.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, you know what it is too, um, I mean if I have to borrow from my sister till Friday I can but it's not like I really had extra money for a battery sitting around.
<b>DR:</b>	Of course, you don't even have money for food.
<b>PT:</b>	No and it's just always something, I can't even get like here and I know it's just a small little thing in life but—
<b>DR:</b>	But it's the straw that breaks the camel's back sometimes.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it feels like it's always been an issue in our life.  Like growing up, we had our dinner but we always wanted more.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	There was never enough.  I never dreamed I'd have to grow up and worry about the same thing, even worse, you know, you just don't think when you're a kid you're going to have to worry about, you know, I mean I did get everything for [NAME OTHER] that, well, [NAME OTHER] gave me that, I wanted to make sure he had what he needed, I just [INAUDIBLE] certain things to where I would say that.
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	He's not a lazy person, he really wants to get out but he gets so scared and [INAUDIBLE] example—
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Poor guy.
<b>PT:</b>	I know it's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	But there are jobs that don't require a lot of people contact.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah and I keep telling him that.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	I said we'll just have to keep looking baby.  Um, I mean he gives me no trouble, you know, he's a good kid, he doesn't go out and drink, he doesn't do any drugs.
<b>DR:</b>	He's very sweet.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm very lucky that way because he's [AGE] and gosh, [NAME OTHER] had already taken me for a run at that age, you know, and he's very good and I, you know, my family just [INAUDIBLE], you're right, they are so judgemental.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah and there are a lot of things they don't get.  They're probably not going to make an exception for [NAME OTHER], unfortunately, I wish they would but they're probably not going to.
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, it's—
<b>DR:</b>	What about the food bank at the church, why not have a standing appointment with the food bank?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I went to the [DEIDENTIFIED] one once and, um, they like, um, well [DEIDENTIFIED] used to have a nice one, they would let you pick things out but [DEIDENTIFIED] won't—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And it's not that I'm ungrateful but a lot of times they put something in the box [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Like there's just certain things that kids won't eat—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I don't want to sound, you know, mean but they're not going to eat that.
<b>DR:</b>	What about you?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm just a, I'll eat peanut butter and jelly every day, I don't care.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I, I'm simple.
<b>DR:</b>	So at least if you've got you covered, that's 1 less person you have to worry about.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah but I'm not so much worried about myself, I can go without it for so long, um, I just want to make sure [NAME OTHER] and even [NAME OTHER], I, you know, when I, um, make something, I try to make, um, egg salad for her to take to lunch but then we lost our power for 7 hours the other night—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh that's right.
<b>PT:</b>	So I had to get rid of a few things because I didn't trust it after that long.
<b>DR:</b>	That's the last thing you need.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, so I'm like the few things I had—
<b>DR:</b>	There goes the food supply.
<b>PT:</b>	Were gone.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	But I do, like I try to make sure that there's enough for the, you know, like they're okay, they're covered, you know what I mean.  I just like to make sure that, um, they're okay and I think what happens is like every time I get that low low point though and you just have enough necessities, that's when I really start feeling [INAUDIBLE], a complete [INAUDIBLE].  People could tell me 100 times or not but I don't believe them, I just don't provide well enough for my children.  I know they're adults now but they're still my [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, everybody thinks they're, but they're still, you know, [NAME OTHER] is going to school, she starts up again and I will do anything to encourage her to pursue her, I want her to have that so much.
<b>DR:</b>	She's a very talented young woman.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  She'll end up in a bad marriage, at least she have a good supporting income.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	That's my biggest, if I could just get her and I keep saying, you know, just get her done and, um, she's so wise though, she's such a, I love her but she gets so obnoxious, she so nasty, I can't even tell people because she's my daughter and I love her but sometimes.  I'm just going to have to change some things around the house with her—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh sure, it's give and take.
<b>PT:</b>	And let her know, I'm going to put the hamper, like I said, in her room because—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't have dirty clothes in my hamper, I can't, it drives me nuts.  My hamper is always empty.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sure.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and I'm going to have to put it in her room because for me and [NAME OTHER], I'll just wash our clothes.  Um, I cannot stand, you know, and on purpose, they laugh, they mess up the bathroom towels.  Even [NAME OTHER] gets such a kick out of that, you know, after I'm out of the kitchen, he goes back in there and touches everything.  Even the other day, I was getting out of my car and I have that whole routine in the morning with my car—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	In the garage—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	All the little things I do and I got out of my car and I forgot 1 thing in the car so I had to reopen the car, reset everything again and I'm like God it's so, I want it to just go away like that but I know I couldn't, you know, because then I would get in my office and think, oh God, did I make sure the lights were out again, even though I don't turn the lights on, I've still got to make sure they're out.  It's just so stupid, God, like it's ridiculous, it's such a waste of energy.  [INAUDIBLE] can't help it I just have to, I don't know why some people have that in their minds, why you can't just walk away and leave a mess, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Does the Seroquel ever take the edge off of that or not so much?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, no, Saturday, like I said, I was that very quiet calm, um, I had woke up, like I said, like crying but I was calm but I cleaned, the kitchen wasn't clean enough either and I had to redo the kitchen.  At first I think, because my kitchen is old so I have to always keep it really clean because it looks old.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And I scrubbed all the walls and I Windexed everything and then I took the curtains down and washed them again, it wasn't clean enough, so I go back in again, spray everything again and nothing was clean enough for me Saturday.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	The bathroom wasn't clean enough.  See, because everything is old, so you've got to work even harder to keep it cleaner because it never looks clean.
<b>DR:</b>	To make it look nice, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm in the bathroom, I'm scrubbing the bathroom, you know, and I get the towels all fixed and [NAME OTHER] just like came in and pulled them on me.  I have 1 towel just for their hands, he purposely won't use that one, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	It's his little rebellion I think.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I can live with that but [NAME OTHER] was away so I cleaned her whole room up real nice, washed her curtains, um, I felt like if I couldn't do things, I couldn't think, I couldn't sit down.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I didn't want to sit down, so I tried to stay busy.
<b>DR:</b>	And you did.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, I did and I got the car washed and vacuumed and got the windows done.  Sunday we had that bad storm—
<b>DR:</b>	That was really incredible.  That was like a monsoon.
<b>PT:</b>	I had to take, um, some Xanax and, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Good, that's what it's there for.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I get so, I can't breathe, I hate them, because this one, it wouldn't stop, I'm like oh God—
<b>DR:</b>	That storm went on and on—
<b>PT:</b>	Didn't it.
<b>DR:</b>	And on and on.
<b>PT:</b>	It was so scary, so I did take some of that, um, and like I said, I, the Xanax is okay, I mean I actually could take a whole one if I want—
<b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.
<b>PT:</b>	If I don't want to take Seroquel—
<b>DR:</b>	It's not a very strong dose.
<b>PT:</b>	I can take 2 of the Xanax at night if I want to go to bed.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Like I said, I don't want to take the Seroquel every night because I'm afraid that I'll get agitated again like I did before and I don't want that because that is my only safety net when my mind doesn't stop.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, it's the only thing that, if I do take it, I need to be able to lay down 40 minutes into take it just because, I probably could still stay awake but it just stops everything in here.
<b>DR:</b>	That's what it's supposed to do.
<b>PT:</b>	And I laid on that floor for 4 hours last Thursday, um, till after I talked to you.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, and I said to [NAME OTHER], I said [NAME OTHER], I've got to lay down, I've got to go to sleep for a while.
<b>DR:</b>	And he had good judgement, you know, I called and he said she's okay, she's resting.  I said, okay, I'll try again if she's not up, you know, I'll just keep trying, so but I wouldn't want him to wake you.
<b>PT:</b>	He knows when—
<b>DR:</b>	If you're sleeping, you're safe.
<b>PT:</b>	He knows that, yeah, because he knew when I came home and I said to him, you know, I mean I don't try to hide it.  I said I'm not having a good day [NAME OTHER], I can't, you know, okay mom, okay, and then like I said, I didn't realize it's so much harder to cover up everything in the summer and he saw my leg.  I try to keep my socks up high.  He got really upset.  I told him I had 1 setback because [INAUDIBLE], he just really got upset.  I said mommy just had 1 setback.  I hate to lie but I don't want them to worry either.  I can't and I was just, it's just so hard in the summer but it bothers me with the summer because I have to hide everything more and it's just so much easier in the winter.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, that's pretty bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, I still wonder if it isn't something that helps keep you on the face of the planet, you know, considering that, that's pain that you can control and you've had a lot of pain in your life that you have never been able to control or even see it coming, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean it is good, like I said, I know how to fix it all, I know how to treat it all and I mean I only had the 1 time where I went across here but I didn't bleed and I realized, you know, just like I said, it's really stupid because people just go across but really you should just go straight down, it's better—
<b>DR:</b>	It is better.
<b>PT:</b>	And I realized that and I was doing it and I'm like, you know, it was good that I didn't, um, because I wanted blood—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, it wasn't about, I just wanted it but I didn't finish it.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm glad you didn't keep going.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I didn't finish it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  When was that?
<b>PT:</b>	January.  I mean every once in a while, I mean I'm not going to lie, it's not hard for me to do that, the only thing that scares me is, okay, veins are, um, I can't do that in the house, I can't let the kids see me like that, you know.  If you want to go out in the woods, fine, but like I said before, that was stupid because you can hang yourself anywhere, you know, I just don't want my kids to ever find me like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I would never let them find me like that, you know, but it's just not as hard as people think.  Blood does not bother me at all, you know, and it doesn't bother me to look at myself and just do that, you know, the only problem is if I ever did that I'd have to succeed because you have to get that stitch once you cut it and I sure as hell ain't going to the hospital, I can tell you that and you have to because your vein won't—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's very hard to heal with a transverse cut.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's that weird, I don't know why I think of these little things.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you are a medical professional, so—
<b>PT:</b>	I don't want to be in the medical profession.  I didn't want cancer, I don't want to know everything.  I don't want to know all that.  I mean knowledge comes with it because you have to educate yourself on every test you get because no one else tells you, you have to be your own advocate when you have cancer because if you don't do your own homework and research and I was worried about you because that cyst, you've got to take it off.
<b>DR:</b>	The good news is the technician didn't see anything—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	So that's good, so I'm waiting for the official but I think it was just a precaution.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, but that's good—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But if you ever had a cyst, I was thinking about that, don't ever let them say we'll watch it—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because if you have to watch it, it has to come off, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	If she has to watch it, it's coming off.
<b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, you know, they can never real what something is until it's under the microscope.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's true.
<b>PT:</b>	And if it's your life and they come back, like when I had that lump out here a few years back, I was either going to wake up with a breast or not and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] did it, she was so nice, at [DEIDENTIFIED], a very good surgeon but luckily the lump was benign—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	But [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said, they're like, uh, we're going to watch you, he was going to order a mammogram.  I got my first mammogram at [AGE].  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said no, Huh-uh, no, we just took, um, cancer out of her back and no, I want, no—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So they agreed and then luckily it was but they said, you know, if it was cancer, I told them to take the whole thing.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't blame you.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't want a lumpectomy and I didn't know if I was going to wake up with a boob or not.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Luckily it was benign, um, and, um, but I knew going in there, okay, it could be malignant, it could have spread, it could have moved, so whenever they say something about a lump, I want it off.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	If it comes back nothing, great—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	But unless they look at it—
<b>DR:</b>	Send it to the lab, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], oh it looks small, whatever—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But you know what, cancer starts out small—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly and it can have tentacles and it can metastasize.
<b>PT:</b>	So if you ever have something, just get it off.  I was worried about you.
<b>DR:</b>	Aw.  I should, I should have been more, uh, circumspect.
<b>PT:</b>	No, but I never want you to have anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because my niece [NAME OTHER], my [AGE] niece had thyroid cancer last year.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER]'s daughter.
<b>DR:</b>	That's incredible.
<b>PT:</b>	And she got her whole thyroid out.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh God bless her.
<b>PT:</b>	Radiation.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	It was very rare but curable kind but then she had to have radiation again this summer to follow up—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm always calling her because she never takes her medicine every day and I said [NAME OTHER], you know, she's [AGE] now, I said you've got to take it every day—
<b>DR:</b>	Good for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Because you don't have a thyroid, I said, you know, mom mom takes that and aunt [NAME OTHER], I said you need to take that honey.
<b>DR:</b>	You're right.
<b>PT:</b>	You've got to keep everything balanced.
<b>DR:</b>	You're right.
<b>PT:</b>	But when they're young like that, she had, um, she had all this, I said to [NAME OTHER], um, you know, we're there for her, we, anything [NAME OTHER], you know, we were all there 100%, this is really strange but my brother [NAME OTHER], when I first got the melanoma, the first time I was [AGE], my nanny had given him a sacred heart thing—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	For some reason, he still had it.  When I first got the cancer, which really touched me, [NAME OTHER] gave that to me—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And he said to me, hold this—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And keep it and it'll keep you safe, I don't need it.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So I always treasured that.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I kept it with me at all times in my wallet.  When [NAME OTHER] got the thyroid cancer, I went over by myself to see her and I took her aside and I said this is what your dad gave me, I'm giving it back to you now.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh that's beautiful.
<b>PT:</b>	So I said I want you to keep this by your heart, I said it's from our nanny, and it'll keep you safe.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So I wanted it to keep doing its good thing but I wanted her to know that it was very special to me, that I wanted her to think of it as something special for her too and that was probably the, I never knew why [NAME OTHER] did that but I always treasured that 1 moment—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Of him being a brother to me.
<b>DR:</b>	He's not all bad.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, and I always thought that was special and I always kept it and I thought if I don't keep it with me, I'm going to get cancer and die but then I realized that it was [NAME OTHER]'s turn to have it for a while and then maybe some day she'll feel the need to give it someone else who has cancer in our family.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly, exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, so I wanted her to have that and I got to spend some time with her alone and talk to her about cancer.  She was asking me questions and I was just very honest with her, you know, I said I hope [NAME OTHER] they get it all, I said but we just have to see what happens and take 1 day at a time.  I can't promise you everything is going to be okay because I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I said so you're going to be a cancer survivor, you're just going to have to take 1 day at a time, so she was, it was a very good moment with us and it was nice because, um, I felt like she was really listening to me because when you're that young, cancer is the kind of death, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I only left this on—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh that's okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Only because [NAME OTHER]—
<b>DR:</b>	That's quite all right.
<b>PT:</b>	Is going to pick me up.
<b>DR:</b>	Whatever you need to do, not a problem.
<b>PT:</b>	That's okay, I have no idea [INAUDIBLE] so I'm not going to answer it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, well do what you need to do, it's not a problem.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know who's number, that's not [NAME OTHER], he's not done work yet but he's supposed to come and get me, um, you know, today and then, yeah, so [NAME OTHER] did have cancer, so that's what I mean, everybody, everybody [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I don't know what your family would do without you, you're like the empathetic inspirational person.
<b>PT:</b>	They don't look at me like that.  Like they always have to see such like negative, like they always have to act like I'm mental and I'm not really mental, mental, I've got my demons but I've got a heart and I will help anyone who needs it—
<b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.
<b>PT:</b>	If I can help you, I will help you, I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	That is without a doubt.
<b>PT:</b>	Like I told you before, when those kids were little, I had them all the time but I never looked at it like that, I looked at it like [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] needed me.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Because he was never home, I mean he worked the 2 jobs because, like I said, the 1 job was [INAUDIBLE].  He never was home, never, never, and you know what, it was okay because when he was home, he was just nasty anyway.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And it was better for the kids because, like I said, every time he'd scream, [NAME OTHER] would go right into an asthma attack—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, poor little thing—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'd tell him, do not yell like that, she's scared of you—
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	Your own daughter is afraid of you and poor [NAME OTHER], I can still see him standing there with his feet [INAUDIBLE], he was so cute and he would scream and try to [INAUDIBLE], just jump in front of him, you are not going to hit him.
<b>DR:</b>	Good for you.
<b>PT:</b>	I would not let him hit him.  Hitting a kid doesn't work, it makes a kid feel horrible.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah and it turns the adults into a bully, just a bully.
<b>PT:</b>	Like I said, he never liked [NAME OTHER], never—
<b>DR:</b>	How can you not like your own child?
<b>PT:</b>	The time I had [NAME OTHER], I think he was jealous of him.
<b>DR:</b>	He was jealous, you're right, you are right.
<b>PT:</b>	He didn't want me sharing my love with a baby.
<b>DR:</b>	That's ridiculous.
<b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] required a lot, [NAME OTHER] was very colicky, he required my attention a lot, he was a baby—
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, like I said, his molars they had to cut, they wouldn't come down his gums—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	He had so much pain his first year.
<b>DR:</b>	Poor little guy.
<b>PT:</b>	They would be like purple and blue—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And they had to slice them to come down.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I mean [NAME OTHER], everything was always [INAUDIBLE], then like I said, [NAME OTHER] came along and [INAUDIBLE] she's a girl, then [NAME OTHER] came along and he was so quiet and so happy all the time and they played together so good those kids.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm glad they have each other.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean I always tell them how wonderful, like, like I said, I always took them everywhere with me.  After that time of finding [NAME OTHER] covered with the bruises—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I never left them home.
<b>DR:</b>	Good for you.
<b>PT:</b>	I took them everywhere and they were so good for me, I never had, I never remember screaming at my kids.  Anytime we'd go to a friend's house, they would compliment how good they were and the kids knew it, they didn't behave, we were not going to go.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	So you know, that was not acceptable, behave and things will always, you know, all through school their teachers loved them and, uh, [NAME OTHER], like I said, [NAME OTHER] was a very good boy, sometimes he could be difficult because [NAME OTHER] was like, God, he was like me that way, he's a know it all too, he had to understand everything, you had to explain everything to [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	You couldn't take him to a doctor's appointment without telling him 2 days before.
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER], you're going to the doctor's honey.  You just had to give him the heads up—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	That's just how [NAME OTHER] was, where [NAME OTHER], you could say we're going to the, she got allergy shots every week for 7 years I brought her down here for her shots—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Because that's how bad her allergies were.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And it really helped her a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	Every week there'd be 8, 8 kids or more in my mini van, I loved that.  I woke up that day and it was gone, it broke my heart.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, why was it gone?
<b>PT:</b>	We were supposed to each pay half and he never sent his half—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And I came out of my apartment 1 day and it was gone.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	My sister called the police station and they said they were notified it was a repo.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	I, I took care of that van, it was used when I got it but I never thought I could drive a van but once I got used to it, I was like, oh I vacuumed, I loved my van—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I mean it was hard enough losing the house but then the van, I was like—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my.
<b>PT:</b>	I took a day, I just missed—
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	But it was long and it was good and we didn't have a car for months.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And I keep thinking of stuff like, okay, we've got to do that—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] not having anywhere to live.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	God, we moved 6 times in 7 years but you've been in this house for, 5 years this February.
<b>DR:</b>	That's so great.
<b>PT:</b>	And it's our house and I keep trying to [INAUDIBLE], part of my mind starts to do that but then the other part just, I sit back and I'm right back to miss negativity, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Like I can't do this anymore, I can't do this and then I'm like, I've got to this, you know, we can't quit in life because then the kids will think it's okay to quit in life and you can't quit in life, we've got to show them that we've just got to keep going and even if I don't have any happiness right now, I have to just keep going because the kids, they deserve to have [INAUDIBLE] life.  You know, they had a hard, it was hard for them these last 10 years.  People say, you know, but it was very hard, they don't know what it was like not having a father.
<b>DR:</b>	Of course not.
<b>PT:</b>	It was very hard for my kids and they're like, well he was crappy anyway.  It doesn't matter—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	It matters that they felt lost—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And they had to deal with things differently and sometimes mom wasn't right and they had to deal with all my moods and sometimes I had more bad days than good but they had no one else so they had to deal with mom.
<b>DR:</b>	And they always knew you loved them—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I mean you came to their protection so much more than anybody ever did for you, which is remarkable because didn't even really have an example to follow, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	No, [INAUDIBLE] everyday, I tell them every day I love them, every day—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so when you start to think of yourself as a failure, remember those things, you know, nobody starved to death, you know, in terms of the material things—
<b>PT:</b>	We don't need all that.
<b>DR:</b>	Everybody would like more material things but the important thing is they know they're loved, they're safe and dry and—
<b>PT:</b>	And you know, when it comes down to it, material things aren't all that.  So you have a [INAUDIBLE] but you know what, it's just a house, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	People don't even really need to eat that much food—
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You know—
<b>PT:</b>	And that's like, I mean I can do, I can go with just eating 2 pieces of toast that day, where I just have to have something in me.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, of course.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I can, I can go, it used to be so easy for me not to eat for days and now it's like, [INAUDIBLE], I could just stop eating, it'd be so much easier and it was stupid because I was a skinny kid but my dad hated fat people, my dad hated anybody fat.  When my mom gained weight, my dad was so mean to her.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh dear.
<b>PT:</b>	She was so unhappy anyway—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	When her thyroid went.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh geez.
<b>PT:</b>	She would look at him [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	That's why I felt like I had to, you know, hide because he would not take my mom anywhere, he would tell her she was fat—
<b>DR:</b>	That's sad.
<b>PT:</b>	It hurt her—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And you know, I know, even now, he'd say my boys were too big.  He was a very lucky person, he was a very skinny person.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	He had luck with metabolism.
<b>PT:</b>	He would look at my mother like [INAUDIBLE], I can still the disgust.
<b>DR:</b>	That's too bad.
<b>PT:</b>	My mom was really even more depressed.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	And then she would eat even more and I mean you didn't gain any weight because even now, if my sisters notice a pound, they'll say it, I mean my sisters are bigger than me, they all are but still, they'll notice it, they'll be like oh my God, you gained weight, they notice everything on me but my father, he would just, he just didn't, and my mom, she just was in a [INAUDIBLE] place, it wasn't her fault her thyroid went underactive on her.  Of course she stopped taking all that speed—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	So everything came—
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	And she gained, he wouldn't even look at her and I mean, he wouldn't, I know he wouldn't look at her.  And all they did was argue at night because he'd come home drunk and they'd fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, it's a terrible environment to grow up in.
<b>DR:</b>	It really is.
<b>PT:</b>	My room was right here and I'd be like shutting my door but—
<b>DR:</b>	You don't even want to hear it.
<b>PT:</b>	My mother, like I said, she was just flipping out at him.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, come 5 in the morning, it was the same thing every day, where's your father's socks, get out of bed, where's his socks.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It was a shame, I mean it just, my [NAME OTHER], it's funny because he knows, he goes mom, whenever you talk about something bad you laugh about it and I go, well if I didn't laugh about it [NAME OTHER], I wouldn't be here.
<b>DR:</b>	It's like an old Irish saying, you laugh so you don't cry.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And he doesn't understand that, you know, even when people hurt you laugh.  I said yeah cause I have to do that [NAME OTHER].  I said when you grow up, you'll understand more.
<b>DR:</b>	Has he ever read the book Angela's Ashes by [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b>	No, but we saw the movie.
<b>DR:</b>	It's a great movie and it's a great book.
<b>PT:</b>	That was so sad and—
<b>DR:</b>	You'd be amazed how much humor is in the book.
<b>PT:</b>	Really.
<b>DR:</b>	For all the pain that he went through.
<b>PT:</b>	I'll have to tell him.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I, he—
<b>DR:</b>	If I can find that book, I'll loan it to you.
<b>PT:</b>	Once in a while, he'll read.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah and that's a good one and I mean with the Irish in your background—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know.
<b>PT:</b>	And you know what he's downloading for me now?
<b>DR:</b>	Huh-uh.
<b>PT:</b>	Mama Mia CD.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	ABBA's like my favorite, you could never tell anyone that.
<b>DR:</b>	I love them too.
<b>PT:</b>	I love all the music to that.  See, I wanted to go see the movie but I don't want to sit in the movie theatre right now.  I always have the fear in the movie theater, I don't know why, but I'm not comfortable in a movie theater.
<b>DR:</b>	What about the back row?
<b>PT:</b>	Even, I might be able to do the back row but I just love [NAME OTHER] and I haven't gone to that, I don't go to the movies.
<b>DR:</b>	She's going to be great in that and you know the daughter is a local girl from [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b>	Is she?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, the whole cast is, and I don't even care that they don't sing great, it just looks like a fun—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah and apparently they're pretty good.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I love her.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, she can do anything.
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] said he was downloading that for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh that's great.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I try to listen to the music if I get too down, um, I listen to music, it kind of just, you know, sometimes it helps.  Like I said, I always feel so much better when I come in and talk to you, I just do, I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	You make sense in here.  I mean I think the tough thing is your family doesn't get it.
<b>PT:</b>	You don't judge me and I'm not used to that.  I'm not used to someone listening and being on my side at all, um, and I guess when I leave I was just so much better and then maybe, maybe in the long run it helps me handle the next crisis and I don't know it yet, you know, I've just got to really work on liking people.
<b>DR:</b>	I think you're pretty good at liking people.  Remember the feedback you got at [NAME OTHER]'s memorial, you know, that you were there through hospice and not many people can or will do that, that's real love, that is like a guardian angel type of thing and people recognize that and [NAME OTHER] goes ballistic because he's never even had a glimpse of feeling that deeply himself.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah and like I said, the only reason I can think of him being so mean is because he didn't know everybody and people were talking to me and not him and [NAME OTHER]—
<b>DR:</b>	You also have something he doesn't have which is that empathy for other people and that appreciation that comes with.  Being able to be there and do a good job in one of the most painful situations that there is known to humankind and not only that, you've done it again and again with all the people you've lost and that's one thing you've drawn from the pain that you've suffered is an understanding, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, that's what scares me too though is I've seen death's door with so many people—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And it's not a very horrible thing when it's finally there but it's scary because we're all going to be there some day.
<b>DR:</b>	That's true.
<b>PT:</b>	And part of me, I've never had really that fear of dying, I always hope that I'll go to heaven or I always pray that I'm an okay person and that God, I've done enough good, more than bad and God will take me to heaven.
<b>DR:</b>	I have no doubt whatsoever.
<b>PT:</b>	I worry, what if I did something bad and I don't remember.
<b>DR:</b>	Then you've redeemed yourself a thousand times over.
<b>PT:</b>	But yeah, I mean I'm not afraid to die, I'm afraid of not seeing my kids again.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	That's what I'm afraid of, not, not dying, I don't know, I think people are always afraid of the unknown—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But I do believe that, just from watching people go, that someone is there to take you so it's okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Someone takes you and guides you there—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know and that's the biggest fear is leaving behind unfinished business and I've very lucky because some people don't, like [NAME OTHER] when she got diagnosed it was only 8 weeks ago from the [INAUDIBLE] and she's gone, she didn't even have enough time to put anything in order.
<b>DR:</b>	That's such a shock when it happens.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and I mean we're never promised a tomorrow.
<b>DR:</b>	True.
<b>PT:</b>	You know and then I think will God be mad at me for not always wanting to live, like I have all these things in my mind of what he'll be mad at me for.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't think he'd be mad at you at all, I think he would respect you for the choice you keep making to live when you come face to face with so much pain, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean that's my main goals, to just want to live and I don't have to be the happiest patty perky in the world, um, just get to an okay place in my life with me, not necessarily in a relationship because I, I just don't think I'm, I can't do it, I can't do it right now, I can't focus on another person.
<b>DR:</b>	You've recently been in some really intense relationships too, especially the hospice type relationship and when the grieving time comes, you need to be able to heal on your own and you know, you're right, nobody else can do that.  I think that's why in Judaism they have sitting Shiva where you just sit quietly with people who cared about the other person and nobody needs to say anything.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You just share that experience just by being there.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I think with my family too, they always think if I have a ma, um, I won't need anything or ask them for anything but that's, I don't want a man for that reason.  If I need someone, I want a relationship for other reasons, um, like I'm never going to depend on a man, ever, I haven't had to for 10 years and I don't plan on, um, things are going to be different if I have a relationship this time, they're going to be on my terms.
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, for once, I'm going to make sure it's a healthy thing for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	And you know, I don't feel like I'm at a point to be okay for someone else either.  I'm not at a point if someone is really nice to me and calls me and I'm in one of them moods, sorry buddy, I'm bipolar today, leave me alone, call me next week.  I'm not ready to do that.
<b>DR:</b>	Well sure.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't share that.
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	I, I'm embarrassed.  I, I can't tell people that.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it's nothing to be embarrassed about but when you're ready, say for a support group, you know, that's the first step, sharing that experience with people and then from there you'll figure it out.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You know.
<b>PT:</b>	I feel like they're always rushing when they're, you know this guy [NAME OTHER] might be a really nice guy but now it's just not the right time for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	And I don't want to be pushed into something because they think I should, no, no, I'm not going to do anything I don't want to do anymore—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Because other people want me to.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Does that make sense?
<b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.  You know, when the time is right, if the time is right, the right person will be there, you know, if the time isn't right, listen to your gut because on top of everything else, you don't want to have to feel guilty for disappointing somebody else.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, like if he's nice but yet I'm not ready yet, then I'll feel bad and mean for saying I don't want to go out with you again.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I did that with the last 2.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't do that.
<b>DR:</b>	And they were rushing it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	They were not accepting your needs—
<b>PT:</b>	One wanted to go away, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	To take it slowly.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm in no hurry.  I mean I haven't had a relationship since [NAME OTHER] and I'm in no hurry to rush anything or—
<b>DR:</b>	And it took courage to make the decision about [NAME OTHER], you know.
<b>PT:</b>	I do know that now.
<b>DR:</b>	If only he would get sober.
<b>PT:</b>	But he won't, I'm going to read about it in the paper some day.  He won't.
<b>DR:</b>	And that's such a sad thing.
<b>PT:</b>	I know because I will always love him.
<b>DR:</b>	He sounds like a really neat person.
<b>PT:</b>	But he's [NAME OTHER]'s best friend too and they—
<b>DR:</b>	I, I, I—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, that's why [NAME OTHER] don't talk to me either.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Because we all grew up together.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And he's [NAME OTHER]'s best friend and when we dated, [NAME OTHER] wouldn't talk to me and when he popped a diamond on my finger, [NAME OTHER] called me and [NAME OTHER] made me feel that since we broke up, [NAME OTHER] has made it know, told you it wouldn't work, told you it wouldn't work and I felt like I had to give [NAME OTHER] that chance because we always had feelings for each other and I thought maybe if I told him how supportive I'd be for him and he did good for a while but once he gave me the ring, he thought, okay, I'm going to do what I want, I couldn't let—
<b>DR:</b>	I'm glad you found that out about him.
<b>PT:</b>	I couldn't marry someone for the sake of marrying someone because [NAME OTHER] stopped working, I was supporting 3 children, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh [PATIENT NAME]
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I mean by the time [NAME OTHER] and me split up, I had lent him so much and stuff that—
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, my income tax was gone, um—
<b>DR:</b>	You don't need a 4th child at your age.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, that's what I—
<b>DR:</b>	You know.
<b>PT:</b>	I know it's not my fault, he called me all kinds of mean names and nut case and mental and I thought to myself, well that's a real mean thing to say—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, you know, if you love a person, you don't hurt them like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	This is more mental issues again like—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	With someone being mean to me—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	But [NAME OTHER] every time he gets, he always has something to say about that too.  He knows it hurts me and I don't talk about and I really don't see [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	When [NAME OTHER] or around or even at his house, I don't go.
<b>DR:</b>	Which is—
<b>PT:</b>	You know, [NAME OTHER] is not mean to me but I'd rather not—
<b>DR:</b>	It's uncomfortable, sure.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	And anybody who's [NAME OTHER]'s best friend, it makes me wonder a little bit too.
<b>PT:</b>	They've been best friends forever.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	But [NAME OTHER] knew how [NAME OTHER] was always to me growing up too.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] used to say that I'll never let him hurt you, you know, I, although [NAME OTHER] meant well, [NAME OTHER] was a lot like [NAME OTHER] in some ways.
<b>DR:</b>	It kind of sounds like it.
<b>PT:</b>	Very abusive that way.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you just don't—
<b>PT:</b>	He never physically touched me but like I said, the last night he [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	And that can cut like a knife and your children are there—
<b>PT:</b>	That was it.
<b>DR:</b>	And they're exposed to that.
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] wasn't home that night or [NAME OTHER] because had [NAME OTHER] been home that night, see, I just let [NAME OTHER] fall asleep to sleep it off, I didn't want him driving.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] would have went after him.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So it was a good thing because I said to [NAME OTHER], let him just sleep it off.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Because he would have got in the car, something would have happened.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Let me pass out and then I dealt with it the next morning.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I gave him the ring back.
<b>DR:</b>	Good for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Flipped out, gave him it back.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't blame you.
<b>PT:</b>	I could not—
<b>DR:</b>	You don't need that.
<b>PT:</b>	Be in that situation.
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	Some people get married to be married, I don't want that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, unless the person enhances your life—
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, you bake the cake, that other person is the icing, they can make the cake more fun, if they don't, forget it, you've got the cake—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You know.
<b>PT:</b>	And I do mean some day maybe I'll meet someone that likes to do things that I like to do too.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, I think you will.
<b>PT:</b>	I just have to [INAUDIBLE] long enough, you know.  I'm so leveled when I'm talking to you and then—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you can do it, you know, it's a glimpse and you just take it one day at a time, it's all anybody can do, nobody knows what's in tomorrow but if you get through today, it's that much more healing, you know, it really is.
<b>PT:</b>	Did you ever hear from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b>	No, how about you?
<b>PT:</b>	No, she still must not be back.
<b>DR:</b>	That's so unlike her.
<b>PT:</b>	She'll call though, she must, a lot in the summer she takes off for weeks at a time because—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] [NAME OTHER], um, they go away and they do things, they take classes, [NAME OTHER] took classes last year at a college—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So they do, she likes to use the summer when they're not in school
<b>DR:</b>	That's good, that's—
<b>PT:</b>	She [INAUDIBLE] summer.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, if she can why not—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	If you can do it, I couldn't think of it happening to a nicer person.
<b>PT:</b>	She'll call.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'm sure she will too.
<b>PT:</b>	She'll call, so—
<b>DR:</b>	How is your abscess?
<b>PT:</b>	It's great, it's still there but it never got any bigger—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	So I must have made a really good decision.
<b>DR:</b>	Good and maybe the Doxycycline is starting to work its way in there.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] and it's still, like I said, I'm just, when I go back to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], um, she's my primary, I just want to get my right, um, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Get that—
<b>PT:</b>	There's a cyst there now too.
<b>DR:</b>	Really.
<b>PT:</b>	It popped right up.
<b>DR:</b>	Um—
<b>PT:</b>	But I've been watching it but its just bothering me a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	It could be, because I've sprained ankles many times—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It could just be bothering me, I just—
<b>DR:</b>	There's another tick borne illness that does that too called Ehrlichiosis—
<b>PT:</b>	Wow.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah and it sometimes does travel with the Lyme so—
<b>PT:</b>	Do you ever get sore glands?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I get sore glands here all the time and every time I go to the doctor, they're like you're fine.  I wake up in the middle of the night and it hurts to swallow and within hours it's back to normal.  It's been doing that for a couple years and when I go they're like, no, we don't feel nothing but yet when I'm sleeping it hurts, the weirdest thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	They look at me and a couple years ago my tongue used to sting and they checked it out, there was nothing on my tongue, it would just sting me and then it was fine.
<b>DR:</b>	Hm, when do you see your primary?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I have to make an appointment but last time I had one, I didn't [INAUDIBLE] so I cancelled it.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, bless your heart.  Well, you can suspend copays here for a while if you need to take it to that.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh no, I—
<b>DR:</b>	I don't mind.
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, I have it.
<b>DR:</b>	I have some information on [NAME OTHER], I'm going to send it along with you because, um, there's 1 doctor publishing like this year who is the national expert and that's where I started to get suspicious about your, uh, your, um, why can't I think of the word, abscess, because it tends to cause them to pop up.
<b>PT:</b>	And every time they sliced it, they come back.
<b>DR:</b>	And, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	They never go away.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah and I'm not, um, knowledgeable enough about antibiotics to know what the best alternatives are.  I know Zithromax is a big one and I know you can't take that.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	But, um, you know with some of this latest info, your primary might be able to brainstorm but it does make me wonder if, uh, something like that might be going on.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Especially since you're mentioning the cysts popping up and such, so if I don't have it in here, I'll get it for you next time.  I'm going to look for Angela's Ashes for [NAME OTHER] too because I think that's going to help him.  That's one of the best insights into how humor helped somebody through an absolutely tragic situations, just—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because like I said—
<b>DR:</b>	Tragic.
<b>PT:</b>	I think with [NAME OTHER], his heart was broken when he realized all those nights that he wasn't coming for him.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Waiting—
<b>DR:</b>	It's so sad.
<b>PT:</b>	I saw a little boy's spirit break and that's what happened to [NAME OTHER] and my family says the same thing, especially my mom, get over it.  You know, he can't get over it.
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	Something was broken in him—
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	And he's not ready to get over it.
<b>DR:</b>	He can and he will eventually.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, when he's ready.
<b>DR:</b>	But you don't do it because somebody orders you to do it.
<b>PT:</b>	No, [INAUDIBLE] are his own feelings and I understand why he's shut himself for a little bit.  Sometimes you have to heal that way.  When I shut myself away sometimes, it's better for me that I don't answer the phone or talk with people.  I need to do that to be able to, like Friday was the, the best thing I could have done was not go into work.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Just like the best thing and I said to myself, [PATIENT NAME], I have like still 3 weeks till December to use and I thought—
<b>DR:</b>	Use it.
<b>PT:</b>	When you get like that, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] told me, don't ever worry—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	If you need a day and I thought, you know what—
<b>DR:</b>	I will write you the medical excuse if you need it because you are fighting a medical illness as well as all the bereavement and—
<b>PT:</b>	I know and I thought as long as I'm okay, like I'm okay today, at work yesterday, if I get to that point again, I'll do what I have to do.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Because when I get to that point, like even driving home that day, I needed [INAUDIBLE] and I'm like dammit, I'll just go into [INAUDIBLE] and that's all I could think of the whole drive home and when I get like that, I have no—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	No clear, it's just not clear like it is now.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Something else takes over.  Now today is the [DATE] and then I know in August—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we're on for Friday and then the following Monday.
<b>PT:</b>	That's the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b>	[DATE] and—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Then I think—
<b>PT:</b>	So is it the Friday—
<b>DR:</b>	Monday the [DATE].
<b>PT:</b>	Friday is the [DATE] already.
<b>DR:</b>	Can you believe that?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, I have the [DATE] and the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And you're off the [DATE] and the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b>	Right and then we're back on schedule on, okay, Tuesday, [DATE] at 2:30.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, our books are almost done.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay, and your birthday is the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, I can't believe you remember that.
<b>PT:</b>	I've got it written down.  Oh, so you're back the [DATE] and the [DATE]—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And the [DATE] like—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Oh yeah, we're off that Monday because it's Labor Day.
<b>DR:</b>	How about that, I know.
<b>PT:</b>	Now see my sister got a house down in [DEIDENTIFIED] New Jersey for, um, the [DATE], the [DATE] through the [DATE] and they invited me down, her and her boyfriend.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, can you go?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, if I could trust [NAME OTHER] I would like to.  [NAME OTHER] said he would drive me down and stay overnight so I could stay a couple days and come and get me.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow, that would be so great, you should go.
<b>PT:</b>	I might, I like to walk around the shore.
<b>DR:</b>	It's good for you and you protect yourself from the sun which is also very wise.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, okay, so I've got September, okay, so September is all normal?
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.  We'll go ahead and keep that like usual.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, our book will be out soon.
<b>DR:</b>	Your book?
<b>PT:</b>	Our book, it'll run out—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's right.
<b>PT:</b>	At the end of the year.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm going to keep my radar up for another one.
<b>PT:</b>	I know, it'll be the end of the year, yeah, because I go to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in October, I have to get a couple of stitches, I'm already ready for that.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	Do your kids need any of these because we don't ever use these anymore for—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh sure.
<b>PT:</b>	You know—
<b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.
<b>PT:</b>	Those little separators—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, those are great.
<b>PT:</b>	You know—
<b>DR:</b>	Thank you very much.
<b>PT:</b>	Do they put the plastic things in there?
<b>DR:</b>	You bet.
<b>PT:</b>	How about these like for class projects?
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	My kids are out of school.
<b>DR:</b>	Great, thank you.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they were—
<b>DR:</b>	That's excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	With going live with the computer and all that stuff—
<b>DR:</b>	Isn't that amazing.
<b>PT:</b>	All that stuff was just sitting.
<b>DR:</b>	That's great, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because it's got the little white things—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, oh, yeah, that will definitely be put to use.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Thanks.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because they could have thrown everything—
<b>DR:</b>	Thanks for thinking of that.
<b>PT:</b>	Out and I'm like, you know what, my kids are done school and [NAME OTHER], she's thinking she's going to do special education.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, she'd be wonderful.
<b>PT:</b>	She loves little kids.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh that's great.
<b>PT:</b>	And I told her, I said to her, because I was watching, if I ever had money I'd send it to, um, the hospital, what's that [DEIDENTIFIED]—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the [NAME OTHER] one.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	They're so sweet.
<b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] didn't make it, he was this little baby—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I cried, I had to turn the TV off.
<b>DR:</b>	I know, that's why I can't do pediatrics.
<b>PT:</b>	That's such a special, special, if I had money, it would go there.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know—
<b>DR:</b>	It's a worthy cause.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean it would go to hospice and there—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because those little kids, oh my—
<b>DR:</b>	They're so sweet.
<b>PT:</b>	I know, I know, I cry, I cry—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	God bless them.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So do you have to tape every week or just—
<b>DR:</b>	No, just this 1 time.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, that's it?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I haven't talked [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	No, not at all.  Now, there may be a financial opportunity, they might want to follow up, um, you can say yes or no.
<b>PT:</b>	And it's a drug company?
<b>DR:</b>	No, it's more like a market research group that will probably give the feedback to, um, healthcare plans, I think, because they're saying market research but it sounds like it's for healthcare plans to help encourage doctors to communicate better with patients, so but I'll tell you if I learn more about it, definitely.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean, some doctors [INAUDIBLE] but everybody has only got 15 minutes in a slot anyway, that's not a lot of time for a doctor to really screen patients and, you know, ask those right questions and it's just not a lot of time.
<b>DR:</b>	I feel lucky to be in this practice where I have more control and I can schedule and I can put space in between—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	If we need more time and stuff like that, I feel very lucky.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] have extra time.
<b>DR:</b>	I think I scheduled the next person at 4, so that's not bad timing.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh God.
<b>DR:</b>	That's not bad timing.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, you never rush me out or anything either, you know, and that's always nice because then you don't always feel like, um, you know, you are on the clock.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean, like you thought, I can't think of that [INAUDIBLE], you know, it's weird but—
<b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is like that too.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yes, I have sat when, when it's bad and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] has to do it, he runs behind, so what I do, I call from my house, and say it's [PATIENT NAME] call me when he's ready because I used to sit in there for 3 to 4 hours waiting—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay, so I wasn't alone when I waited a couple hours for the other guy?
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, like when you wait, um, did [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] come right in and see you?
<b>DR:</b>	She did—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	She knew there was a space in her schedule that day, she called me that day and, fortunately, I could come—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	So—
<b>PT:</b>	Because if you, like normally [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] runs very much, pretty good, now [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], like I said, when it's a bad one, he has to do the surgery or any time there's a stitching, he does it, um, and I learned from waiting and waiting and waiting, I'm not coming till you're ready—
<b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I can't tell you how many hours, um, and he's the best at what he does—
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	The most surgery, so I mean you sit and you wait—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But since I live so close—
<b>DR:</b>	That's great.
<b>PT:</b>	Five minutes from there, I tell them and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] knows me for all these years and he's fine and I tell the girl, call me when you're ready—
<b>DR:</b>	That's perfect.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I'd rather sit home and be anxious—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Especially when I'm getting another surgery and more stitches, than sit her for hours and hours and build it all up.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	And they're—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	And [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] thinks I'm a wacko anyway, so he's fine with it.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, he put you in his book, so he must respect you.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean they interviewed me, I think 3 times at least I got to talk to the lady.  It was a little hard because it was right after my father but it was a good thing because one thing about melanoma is people don't still know enough about it.
<b>DR:</b>	That's so true.
<b>PT:</b>	There's not really a lot of support out there like, you know, that why when I do the breast cancer walk, I'm doing it for me too.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I feel like that one moment that I'm a survivor too.
<b>DR:</b>	That is exactly right.
<b>PT:</b>	And they don't have that and you're in a group where it's still not recognized and it's, you know, you can say to someone, oh yeah, I had breast, oh my God, you know, but if you say melanoma, it's not—
<b>DR:</b>	Isn't that strange, even lung cancer is under recognized.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and it was always the hardest, um, harder with that because right away people say, all the time, still, well it's just skin cancer, no, no, no, no, melanoma is so much more.
<b>DR:</b>	It's one of the most lethal too, there aren't as many survivors out there.
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, and that's the hard thing, you're alone with this.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	When I first got it, I know, there was no anything for it, it was like—
<b>DR:</b>	That's so true.
<b>PT:</b>	Luckily the kids were so small that I was focusing on, because at that point [INAUDIBLE], I mean the [AGE] year olds were there—
<b>DR:</b>	Man.
<b>PT:</b>	And I knew what I had to do and I did what I had to do, I had to spare my kids.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm glad you did it.  And you, you survived it, it's phenomenal.
<b>PT:</b>	That's why I say God loves me and I'm here.
<b>DR:</b>	He does.
<b>PT:</b>	You know—
<b>DR:</b>	You still need to—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	Guardian angel on her.
<b>PT:</b>	I've got to keep, you know, I've got to keep fighting, I've just got, you've got to, I, I can't give up.
<b>DR:</b>	Every day you make it through is a success, every week you're back here is a success.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm not giving up because my family is like you don't need to go, no, I need to go because I'm going to feel better and I'm not giving up.
<b>DR:</b>	And you don't need to explain to anybody, if they don't get it, they don't get it.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they've never gotten it.
<b>PT:</b>	I've always felt that—
<b>DR:</b>	You don't expect them to get it now.
<b>PT:</b>	I know but I always had to explain everything in there and it's, I'm realizing now, I don't have to do that.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	If I say no, that means no.
<b>DR:</b>	You're the captain of the ship, it's your ship.
<b>PT:</b>	I've got my bracelet on.
<b>DR:</b>	It looks great on you and I like it with the purple, it looks absolutely, you've got earrings that are perfect with it.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] heart.
<b>DR:</b>	Who knew.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	You'll always think of [NAME OTHER] with that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, I've got to call [NAME OTHER] and I left her a message but I figure, you know, she needs more time than I do because it was her sister, so I just left her a message, if you want to talk, call me.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	If I don't hear from you though, I am going to call you again.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I'm thinking of you, just so she knows that she can call me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you can even say, we could even just sit quietly together.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because the last 2 years—
<b>DR:</b>	I can't even imagine, God bless her.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], I'm worried that she's drinking too much.  [NAME OTHER] said she can't fall asleep without a drink.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	But I'm hoping—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] Oh, you've got a 4:00, I'm not going to have you running late because of me.  I've been in here forever.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it's been good to catch up and, you know, we'll be meeting next Friday so we get a little extra time.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It'll kind of be weird on Friday.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But that'll be good because maybe that'll make me better on the weekend.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe so.
<b>PT:</b>	My weekends are my bored times.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I can tell.
<b>PT:</b>	I, yeah, weekends are hard for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know why, maybe because I think well everybody is out doing something and I can't get out there.
<b>DR:</b>	I think the routine of work helps a little bit, even though work isn't always the most fun place.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, you know it is something, you know, to a certain degree you're the captain of that ship.
<b>PT:</b>	They had a lunch, we had to bring something, it's called Christmas in July.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	I made macaroni salad and this is why I can't stand them, and they're like, oh we like the pasta better and I thought, if you don't like it, don't eat it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	That's how they all are and here's what I did—
<b>DR:</b>	That's ridiculous.
<b>PT:</b>	I got in my car and went home for lunch.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no.
<b>PT:</b>	And I didn't even sit there, I didn't want to be with them.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I don't blame you.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh geez.
<b>PT:</b>	I didn't sit in there with them, I don't care.
<b>DR:</b>	They're just going to nit pick and be negative, it's ridiculous.
<b>PT:</b>	There are so many people like that though.
<b>DR:</b>	There are, you're right.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean the whole world, like boy, I thought to myself, I'm not going to, I had, when I got in yesterday, my house was [INAUDIBLE] 1day.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't believe it.
<b>PT:</b>	There was stuff on the floors but you know what I did really good, I like this, [INAUDIBLE], don't let yourself get like you got last week.
<b>DR:</b>	Good for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Let it go, 1 problem at a time.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	That's what I did.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	I was completely overwhelmed but I just, sometimes if I talk to myself, like I said, I'm okay as long as that doesn't, racetrack isn't up there—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	When that's there, I, I can't think, I can't, I can't, I can't think but I did have enough sense to get out of there though and take Seroquel.
<b>DR:</b>	And next time you'll know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Like I said, it did calm me.
<b>DR:</b>	That's what it's supposed to do.  Some people take 800 mg a day, remember.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] can only take 300 a day and I take 12 and I'm like, my body absorbs things so—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, true.
<b>PT:</b>	Really just, I never need a lot of anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Right and as you fight the infection, you may find your doses of other things adjusting but it's too soon to make major changes.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But I'm just saying you may find down the road, yeah, you know, I can take 25 or I can take 50 and be perfectly comfortable with it now, whereas a year or 2 ago maybe not.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'd be in a coma if I took [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].  God, know you, I don't know, I couldn't be addicted.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so um, yeah, you enjoy the pound cake.  Like I said, it was frozen—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh thank you.
<b>PT:</b>	But there's enough for you and your [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Great, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And then—
<b>DR:</b>	I look forward to it.
<b>PT:</b>	Maybe that's [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	That might be [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b>	Hey [NAME OTHER] are you here?  No, I'm still at work, can you pick me up at the circle?  How long?  Oh, how long, um, are you going to be?  Okay buddy, thanks, in the circle.  Bye bye honey.  Yeah, he's going to get me.
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	He's so, he's good and now we have to get home and then, um, I've got to get under, we've got to get under the hood and figure out the car.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, good luck.
<b>PT:</b>	Just keep your fingers crossed it's just the battery.
<b>DR:</b>	I hope he can give you a jump start and just leave it running for a little while to recharge the battery.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, um, I've now had this car, it's 6 years old, it's a 2002, I've never had to get a battery.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well—
<b>PT:</b>	So it might be time.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe so.
<b>PT:</b>	And I get paranoid in the morning.
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.  I'll turn it off now.  Thank you so much.
