BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: [I mean it's basically black and I know Kelly does too I think.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: And you thought I just had a penchant for colors?
CLIENT: (chuckling) I don't know, I really didn't think they were yours but I don't know. I don't think that you do anything with them because they are all in the same order that they always are. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: This is good therapy for you?
CLIENT: Uh-huh. Well it's really nice that you went to another climax (ph), I always tend to, I would've just seen it unfairly on that (ph). And you get to see my own hair today I should hope.
COUNSELOR: Well I didn't, I don't understand, what do you mean?
CLIENT: You've never seen it before that's all, whether or not you've been aware of that.
COUNSELOR: [I can see that now.] (ph)
CLIENT: You know and I get out of this joy but it's not an important (chuckling) but it's hot. (chuckling) I have hair that's been growing out from one inch long, it's like one way just to... [inaudible at 0:00:58.7] [I still wear it, mostly lean towards it so it's a respectable length so any way you'd single braid on it to this.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: How does it feel?
CLIENT: Cooler. We didn't have any kids today at school but it was really boring and hot so.
COUNSELOR: What do you mean that it was mostly boring?
CLIENT: Mm, a paperwork day for us. Quite a change in my attitude today and so I've been hot and grouchy, well I've been grouchy and I came in here and I got cool and I suddenly said to myself, "You aren't grouchy anymore." I know (chuckling) and it's true.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Oh!
COUNSELOR: So that heat really...makes you grabby?
CLIENT: It really does, yeah. And then... [inaudible at 0:01:52.0] ...then suddenly I feel like... [inaudible]
COUNSELOR: So it sounds like all you have to do is be put in an air-conditioned room and like you're just a different person?
CLIENT: Yeah or that well it was just that much to [being in there.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, um, when I was here Tuesday we were talking about my being confused and I wanted, I was laughing all the way down the stairs because as I was walking down the stairs I was thinking, "you aren't confused about yourself at all" and I was just laughing about that.
COUNSELOR: So do you mean it's not like taking yourself too seriously or something or?
CLIENT: I am?
COUNSELOR: Is it like, I would say and thinking like what was going through was something like, "well to say I'm confused about myself is like taking myself too seriously".
CLIENT: No, it wasn't that, it was just I was telling myself, "you aren't confused about yourself at all" that's all and so I was laughing. [silence from 0:02:54.6 to 0:03:06.3]
COUNSELOR: Some joke, what? I... 
CLIENT: So it's not important, it was just at the time it was humorous to me because I'd been talk, sitting in here being... 
COUNSELOR: Stewing (ph).
CLIENT: ...confused.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you had been like sitting here stewing for an hour about how confused you were?
CLIENT: Yeah and just I thought it was another... 
COUNSELOR: (snapping fingers) Like that...flick of an eyelash all of the sudden and "I'm not confused at all".
CLIENT: Exactly.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: [Or maybe] (ph) [silence from 0:03:37.0 to 0:03:59.2] There was, something happened the other day that I thought was really typical of something that happens to me. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: M-hmm?
CLIENT: It was yesterday and I'm not sure exactly why I thought it was typical but, um, one of the teachers at my school in the Fall, um, was coming on very heavy and I didn't know how to handle this guy, I am very bad at that, and, um, anyway we got it straightened out and we've been going all year, and he came into my room yesterday and said he wanted to see me and took me into the teacher's lounge and told me that, um, he wanted to give me a goodbye kiss, which is fine except that, um, he was very nervous about it and had to explain it for a long time and then... 
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: ...anyway, my, I said to him that it, that was silly and that I didn't see any need to kiss him and I didn't feel anything like that towards him, and then he just kept on. It was all right, I mean it was insignificant, the act, but the thing was, was that I didn't want to do this. I did it and the only reason I did it was like to mask, I couldn't think of anything else to say to not hurt his feelings that would stop him. And when I left I was, um, I was feeling, um, almost - I don't know, not angry with myself, a little frustrated with myself because I didn't - that just, it just seemed like that it was such a typical thing to happen to me. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: And is it also, part of it, like you took the easy way out?
CLIENT: Yeah, oh yeah, I think so.
COUNSELOR: Okay and it's like, it sounds like there are two things typically there; the one is the situation again... [audio blip] [0:06:00.6]
CLIENT: ...form... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...that's a very simple form you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it's sort of the situation of having some guy kind of start to push himself on you or something... 
CLIENT: Some way, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Maybe, you'd - probably usually it's much stronger sexually... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...than that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Okay, but yeah, that was just a... 
COUNSELOR: And that's the one part that's similar and the second part that's similar is like kind of caving in or saying, "Oh, the hell with it."
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: "I can't think of anyway out of this so I might as well just give in."
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah and it bothered me.
COUNSELOR: Well it's like it just made you cringe?
CLIENT: (chuckling) It was in any ways repulsive...it was just... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...there was no reason for it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it was like and you didn't, I mean...that also it's like you didn't want to do this?
CLIENT: And, and I've been, I've thought about it and I couldn't tell anybody about it because I was too embarrassed by what I did to tell anybody about it, anybody else, if I would've told any other person they would've said to me, "And you kissed him?" You know like, "Why didn't you do something?" You know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I didn't know what to do. And you're right I did take the easy way out.
COUNSELOR: And maybe that's what you're feeling about it, was like you just caved in under pressure.
CLIENT: M-hmm and I'm telling myself I'm caving in while or like what are you going to do aside from, I already told him as nicely as I could what I felt, which at least was more than I probably have ever done before and that it didn't have any effect.
COUNSELOR: [So you think] (ph) and I don't know did that make it, does that make, like make it feel to you like telling me (ph) what you're feeling is sort of anticlimactic, like you work yourself up to this and it's like shooting a peashooter off a Sherman tank?
CLIENT: In this case, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: In other, and before I would probably not even done that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: I'd have just thought, "Oh, well."
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And, um, that's the guy that drove me here and I thought, "Oh, no, he's going to drive me here and I don't know what I'm going to do." But nothing happened, I mean he didn't make any kind of a, an advance... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...which I really thought he was going to do, I mean, oh, well.
COUNSELOR: So it's like you gave an inch and expected to be asked to give up a mile or something because he... [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah, because...I thought he was like that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. [silence from 0:08:34.0 to 0:08:48.6]
CLIENT: And I know that I've done things like that, uh, a hundred times probably.
COUNSELOR: Like you look back and your life is sort of one surrender after another it sounds like or you think of it like that? 0:09:07.5]
CLIENT: Yeah and, uh, yeah. The only reason that I, I'm just sure that that must have some kind of, of an effect on me...but I'm, I don't know if it makes me hostile or if there's...underneath or something... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...or just angry at myself or what.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm, but it's like you couldn't, you couldn't fuck yourself over so many times without having some residue of fury or something... 
CLIENT: Something... 
COUNSELOR: ...there [do you think?] (ph)
CLIENT: ...yeah. I know that I've slept with people for the same reason...after a while I was just, "Oh, what the hell."
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Well...which is, um, stupid, because I don't think that, I've never thought about it...afterwards, but I'm sure that I must not like myself for, for that either.
COUNSELOR: But it's stupid to make the rules (ph)... [inaudible at 0:10:19.9]
CLIENT: Somebody that I didn't care about, didn't particular want to and it was just the easy way out to get rid of them or something... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...which is really, it's incredible but I'm sure that it could happen again, like I mean acting... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...this pitiful (ph).
COUNSELOR: Yeah. But it sounds like the horrible part is like a feeling like you don't like yourself or like now that you're doing something that you don't want to do... 
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...but and it's like winding up like not liking yourself for doing this?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I think I suppress that though.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: I just tell myself, "Oh, that doesn't matter."
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: I think that's what I tell myself about a lot of things and I think that maybe that's why I have though sometimes felt some battles in my mind as well. I tell myself this doesn't matter and that doesn't matter and maybe, um, what I'm trying, what I'm trying to deny are some feelings that I... 
COUNSELOR: Like it really does matter?
CLIENT: M-hmm, in that case... 
COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:11:33.4]... 
CLIENT: ...yeah.
COUNSELOR: Could be some of the case with like dating guys it does matter and the way you were talking about it before sounds like maybe it's sort of about an accrual, each time there's a little, you fancy (ph) that as a little dram (ph) of carbolic acid?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, so that's somewhere and I it means something.
CLIENT: Like yesterday that that wasn't a very important thing... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...but I just walked away from there and I thought, "Well you've done it again." You know? [0:12:06.0]
COUNSELOR: Yeah. To cover it literally you could accept that it wasn't such a large thing, sort of like a sense of answer (ph) for yourself?
CLIENT: No, I didn't feel that, I just thought, thought that I was stupid... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...that's all, just that. 
COUNSELOR: Okay. [silence from 0:12:23.9 to 0:13:17.5]
CLIENT: And I think that I'm getting like, um, slightly, just at times, slightly like, uh, depressed this week.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and, um, I think that it's because, I'm really not sure, but I think it might be because, um, I'm angry at different things. Does that make any sense? I don't know. I don't know what, exactly what I'm angry at but, um, I was wondering if like I can take anger that I don't express and that eventually it comes out in a form of like depression or something like that?
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I don't' know if that's possible but I was thinking about that though.
COUNSELOR: Well it could because it sounds like it's a kind of personality theory you've got or it's something like being angry with, being angry out there and somehow winding up instead to be having that anger diffused and just feeling a terrible setup in a sense then? 
CLIENT: Yeah and that I'm not sure if that makes a lot of sense.
COUNSELOR: But you do know that you were angry [at or it,] (ph) there's something that you do know even more or something that you give consent?
CLIENT: M-hmm. I'm not sure what I was angry at, you see that's... (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...where my theory is kind of... 
COUNSELOR: [Well like you said it is.] (ph)
CLIENT: Um... [inaudible from 0:14:49.0 to 0:15:02.5] [silence from 0:15:02.6 to 0:15:23.8] Maybe that's not true at all, maybe just anger just goes away, see I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Maybe it's, um, anger at yourself [too is my guess.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah...again it's like there are a whole bunch of kind of dynamic explanations that you're toying with and don't have any way of choosing one over the other, but the fact for you, I guess, is that you have, then feel upset?
CLIENT: Yeah, that and, um, sometimes, and I was thinking, "What, well why, why am I feeling sad?"
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like you didn't know reason, just like waking up one morning and then finding yourself depressed?
CLIENT: Yeah! Yeah, so that I felt, "Well, okay, why are you feeling like that?"
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know and then I couldn't think of anything, so maybe that's why I thought, "Well I was angry." I was angry yesterday... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and, um, just that it's nothing special just at things.
COUNSELOR: Yeah?
CLIENT: And, um, then I was angry at myself because I wanted to go out and I got real tired and I was just kind of angry at myself for being tired. And I was, anyway, eventually then I got depressed again and I just, so that's probably why I was bitchy (ph) because I'd been angry at things all day.
COUNSELOR: What's?
CLIENT: [You know] (ph) it doesn't sound very logical now that I'm saying it.
COUNSELOR: It sounds like you had a tough time in the last couple of days?
CLIENT: No, tough times sounds so... 
COUNSELOR: That's too legitimate?
CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah, oh, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Things have been bugging you anyway?
CLIENT: Yeah. Minute things though, see that's, that's the whole thing, ridiculous things like zippers (chuckling) on clothes, things like that.
COUNSELOR: Sure (ph), things that really shouldn't bother you though?
CLIENT: Yeah, well...things that can bother you but that's just, it's silly to get irritated over all those things. Yesterday I, I worked (ph) at my own apartment trying on clothes for an hour, trying to find something to wear tonight, because the thing that I wanted to wear, I remembered it had a broken zipper and so I was angry at her even though she didn't know she had done it, angry in general because I couldn't find anything to wear, then I went to James' apartment and I walked in and nobody was there and it looked, it was very messy, and I started to scream, "I can't stand living like a pig." And I was sort of yelling and I'm sure I was getting rid of my anger yelling. [0:18:43.8]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And, um, so anyway and then...it was just kind of a nasty afternoon. [silence from 0:18:52.2 to 0:19:10.7] And I was a nasty bitch today because it was hot and I was [kind of really nasty with her,] (ph) horrible... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and I was ashamed of myself. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: I was going to say, the way you're telling it to me, you seem sort of embarrassed about yesterday and today, you know?
CLIENT: I was embarrassed about yelling yesterday, because after I got finished with yelling I suddenly thought that James' roommate was in his bedroom and I thought, "Oh, my God, I've been yelling like this for five minutes and he's in his bedroom (chuckling) and he thinks I'm crazy." But he wasn't there, but anyway, that was enough to embarrass me of course (ph).
COUNSELOR: You've come close to somebody hearing that crazy display of... [overlapping voices at 0:19:49.2]
CLIENT: Well I mean though I wasn't talking to anyone, I was just - it would've been different I guess if Joshua would've been there, I was just yelling at the apartment.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And... 
COUNSELOR: But it sounds like it made you goddamn angry to walk in and find the place looking like a cyclone had hit it?
CLIENT: Oh, it did! Oh, it did.
COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:20:06.4]... 
CLIENT: That's, that's legitimate.
COUNSELOR: What's not legitimate, yelling like a banshee to nobody?
CLIENT: No, that was all right too.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: But if he would've been there then I would've been embarrassed that I was yelling, that's all.
COUNSELOR: Why?
CLIENT: (chuckling) I don't, I don't even know! If I were asleep in bed and I suddenly heard someone come in and start yelling, "I can't stand living like a pig in this pigsty anymore." I would, I might laugh at it or something or I might be afraid to come out of the bedroom.
COUNSELOR: And he might, you mean he might feel that, "My God, I've been keeping this place like a pigsty."
CLIENT: (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: No?
CLIENT: Yeah, he might have thought that, I don't know, it's the truth anyway. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: But if it's all over in my mind and it seems like it's too bad he wasn't in his bedroom?
CLIENT: Yeah, as you say that you're right, it probably is too bad.
COUNSELOR: If he's the prime pig?
CLIENT: He is the prime pig though. (chuckling) [silence from 0:21:19.6 to 0:21:36.5]
COUNSELOR: I could see him saying, "Oh, my God, I finally know what her limits are, I'd better shape up."
CLIENT: (chuckling) Well maybe I should've done that a long time ago. [0:21:48.6]
COUNSELOR: Yeah (ph).
CLIENT: I mean well maybe I should have and now it's too late, because that's something that I'm usually mad at about, oh, 40 percent of the time.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, well like it's that old story.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah, yeah.
COUNSELOR: By the time they come in you've just sort of been keeping it inside of you all this time, saying little bits of... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...but not really the feelings you've been having.
CLIENT: M-hmm. I get...I can go on and on about it but... there's nothing you can do about it. [silence from 0:22:35.3 to 0:22:51.7] I'm not angry about it today because he yelled if I lifted. (chuckling and/or sighing)
COUNSELOR: You're not angry at it anymore because you discharged (ph) falling under a... 
CLIENT: Uh-huh, plus, um, I, I related this story to James and, um, he then cleaned up the apartment. He laughed at me when I told him...but he then cleaned up the apartment.
COUNSELOR: He laughed at you but it had its effect?
CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah. [silence from 0:23:19.6 to 0:24:16.9] I remember what I wanted to talk about, the sort of thing you'd like to talk about. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: That makes it sound like you don't have anything to talk about?
CLIENT: I don't, I mean I can't, I can't think of anything. [silence from 0:24:29.9 to 0:24:56.4] You know I've said before about, um, I don't know, about being aware or try, or thinking about how I, um, appear or come across to people, um, and I said that that's, and that's because I overdo it, you know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: But, um, I was just, in my mind as I was trying to think about, I was thinking of this term 'self awareness' and I didn't know what it was and I was thinking about that. And, um, that (ph) must be part of it... 
COUNSELOR: Similar.
CLIENT: (big sigh) ...because you are yourself inside it but you're also yourself in the way that you are and [I would say.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: [Like all messed up?] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, because those aren't two separate things really or that...or if they are then it's, um, something's messed up, right? Um... 
COUNSELOR: [Like that...] (ph)
CLIENT: ...this should be... 
COUNSELOR: ...continuous... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...inside and outside, right (ph)?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
COUNSELOR: And you're feeling like, well I mean sort of having a little trouble talking because I'm wondering if it's like for you that you feel like there is some sort of discontinuity then if we turn this up?
CLIENT: I don't know.
COUNSELOR: [I'm just trying to...] (ph) [silence from 0:26:31.7 to 0:26:42.0] But is that what, like with what... 
CLIENT: No, no I hadn't any judgment. Actually I was thinking about a, a person that wasn't me... 
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh!
CLIENT: ...that's all.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And that just made me have to think about me again.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. For you wondering if there was or just kind of thinking about whether there was?
CLIENT: Mm, thinking that there should be, m-hmm... 
COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:27:10.9]... 
CLIENT: ...or I mean I realize that there are...defenses there, I think I've got defenses either way. If it's all defenses kind of thing then I think it is... 
COUNSELOR: Not good?
CLIENT: No (ph).
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and like there should be some basic way in which who you are inside is like who you are outside?
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. [silence from 0:27:31.9 to 0:27:42.4]
CLIENT: And I'm trying to think if, um, I try to make myself inside like how I think I should be outside.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it's sort of like slinking backwards you're thinking?
CLIENT: Yeah, and, um, that's got to be confusing, I mean that must [cause it to.] (ph) [0:28:01.6]
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It must lead you astray to have to like make your guts slide into this other, those expectations?
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: [I mean in this case.] (ph) [silence from 0:28:16.8 to 0:28:44.0]
CLIENT: Now this seems important to me but I'm not sure, I don't know what I'm thinking about it, I'm not thinking anything about it. But, um, [silence from 0:28:50.0 to 0:29:03.8] maybe that's well part of the reason why I like, um, am in conflict with myself.
COUNSELOR: Could be.
CLIENT: I'm, see the thing though, the thing that confuses me is that I'm not really that aware that I do things that, um, what, violate some kind of way that I'm really feeling and I...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...I don't think that I do or if I do it's not violate (ph), if I, if I do something I don't want to do for a social reason that's that, um, that's not wrong, I don't think or, or unhealthy or bad for you.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm, like if you do you mean like something out of politeness or concern, even though you don't want to do it, like that's okay?
CLIENT: M-hmm. M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: And I guess, I mean you're also saying and besides, other than that class of actions, like you can't think of others where you've done things that you haven't wanted to do?
CLIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Is that what you're saying?
CLIENT: No, yeah, but that's not right is it, um, because I started out the session saying that... 
COUNSELOR: Ah, right... 
CLIENT: ...that I'm thinking about it.
COUNSELOR: ...[thinking about that, yeah.] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah. [silence from 0:30:29.0 to 0:31:11.8] I don't know what other kinds of things are (ph) okay.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Now I'm thinking that maybe there are but I, I don't know what other class of things.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And like there may be others but it sounds like the one that really sticks out for you is the (ph) sexual?
CLIENT: Yeah. [silence from 0:31:33.0 to 0:31:48.2] And I'm trying to think if, um, I'm trying to think about how that fits, causes a conflict, because, um, I was aware that I didn't want him to do it, Jerry.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So I wasn't, um, fooling myself in that respect.
COUNSELOR: Good (ph). So (ph)?
CLIENT: But maybe the fact that I just did it anyway and not - I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it sounds like you're saying at least this time sort of like that you were, you were restrained inside and there was no confusion inside, [that you knew you that,] (ph) that you knew you didn't want to do it period.
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: It wasn't a case of trying to make your inside be in harmony with outside?
CLIENT: Well I think that's true in other cases too, that's right, and I really wasn't referring to that time.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Maybe, um, I'm saying a long time ago, and I don't know how long ago that is, but at some point in the past maybe I was confused.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: But for at least a couple of years, even when I've done things, um, sexual things that I didn't particular care to do, it's like I knew that I didn't want to do them and I... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...didn't know what to do.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: So I just did them.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. So that over the last couple of years that was inside you from [the strain that kept you] (ph) confused?
CLIENT: Yeah, but then how do I get confused? (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Apparently you just... 
CLIENT: Well I, I obviously am confused about something about, I mean I think it's obvious, don't you, about the way that I think? Telling myself, "this is true and this is true", that's what I'm trying to tie in with this, maybe that... [0:34:11.7]
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay, you got that but the fact is that everything seems true about you, to you; you're confused, you're not confused?
CLIENT: Oh, right, okay.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, everything's been true, you're saying, "well how do I get there, how is that that I'm that way?" Um, I think one possible explanation is that you've had to kind of twist your insides out of shape to go with other peoples' desires, like peoples' expectations, but for the last couple of years that doesn't seem true, like you haven't twisted your insides out of shape, like you've been compliant but you've been straight and known you were doing that for somebody else?
CLIENT: M-hmm, plus (ph) the confusion is still there, right?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Well it sounded like a good explanation when I said it, now I'm thinking that it's... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...like it's not very good. (chuckling) [silence from 0:35:12.1 to 0:36:12.7] Now I'm just thinking about those tests, I'm sorry, I'm not thinking about that at all.
COUNSELOR: What tests?
CLIENT: The tests that I have to take when I'm out of here.
COUNSELOR: [The tests when you leave us?] (ph)
CLIENT: When I'm, I'm not taking them today, I'm taking them next week... 
COUNSELOR: Oh (ph).
CLIENT: ...cognitive (ph), I was just thinking about that, wondering if I've changed my attitudes about myself, that's all.
COUNSELOR: (yawning) Yeah (ph).
CLIENT: Because I think I, I'm not sure what I said but I think I said things like, "I'm not confused about myself", (chuckling) that's all and I thought, um, I was just wondering what else I had said. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: So it sounds like, "Well I don't know, maybe I just blew it."
CLIENT: (deep breath) Play it straight.
COUNSELOR: Why couldn't you - I'm not sure how to say it - it's something like that, like you're not sure, like you won't (ph) know whether you've, whether you're any different until you look at the tests or something like that, like or until you do them I mean? [0:37:24.9]
CLIENT: Uh-huh, well I probably won't even remember then... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...the thing, um, oh, that's true, I mean I don't think I know anyway.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah and it's like you'd like some kind of truth (ph), some kind of, um - what the hell do I mean - like a landmark or something, like you'd like to know that, I mean where you were to know if you were any different now?
CLIENT: Uh-huh, curious...it's not a compulsive desire but very curious.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well what do you feel?
CLIENT: Um, I think about myself more... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...about things that I do... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...I think but that's all that I know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I think I was talking about that on Tuesday too, when I said that wasn't, I said that that wasn't good, that it was selfish or I might have said that. I was talking about being selfish anyway and I think that I might have said that. Um, and then when I left here I thought that that wasn't bad (ph) because it was something that I should do, um, at least for a while, until I didn't have to do it. Does that make sense?
COUNSELOR: Say it again?
CLIENT: That I should, when I'm thinking it's like watching myself, but I don't mean watch myself to keep myself from doing things, but, um, pay attention, think to myself, "Is that what I want to say?" Anyway, because if I don't do that then I'll just keep on being like I was and I should do it until I don't have to do it anymore, that's what... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...I'm saying.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah and it sort of sounded like that until, you should kind of pay attention to yourself and what you're doing until you know you're doing it all right, so that you don't do it wrong (ph)?
CLIENT: Yeah, um, until I'm sure enough of how I am, however that is, that I know more how I am. Now I don't know how I am. [0:40:23.6]
COUNSELOR: I know, [I mean, yeah.] (ph)
CLIENT: And I think, yeah, I think that's all right. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. One thing you're saying is you're a stranger to you now, in many important ways?
CLIENT: M-hmm, I think it's, it's like, um, not a stranger exactly, I don't know about a wife (ph) of non-courage (ph) but maybe it's like a mother, somebody that's always there but you don't pay any attention.
COUNSELOR: [Someone used to attempt or gladly is part of the furniture?] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And that's how you've been with you?
CLIENT: M-hmm, yeah, and the puzzling things, um, come out for a while. I either try and then think about it and if it gets too confusing I stop or if I don't like what I'm thinking then I stop also and, um, [that's about it,] (ph) so I stop, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And besides there is so much that sort of feels familiar and why hassle if you know they're stuff (ph)... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...like, "I know she's going to bring me my meals so why should I worry that she's crying now or..." [overlapping voices at 0:41:55.5] 
CLIENT: Mm, yeah, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay (ph). [silence from 0:41:58.4 to 0:42:16.2]
CLIENT: Here, (ph) uh, a couple of weeks ago or last week or sometime I was talking about, um, how I thought about people dying, and today I was leaving school and, um, I said goodbye to James and I thought, "Well, um, I'm not going to see him again." (chuckling) Well then I laughed...it makes me laugh now because I think it's ridiculous that that's exactly what I do a lot [I think.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: What that you think you're not going to see people anymore?
CLIENT: Because they're going to die... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...or I'm going to die... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...it depends on which, it could be either way, today I wasn't sure.
COUNSELOR: One of you dying (ph)?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah? [silence from 0:43:08.5 to 0:43:26.2] And it sounds like being helpless before fate or something and like nothing that you're going to do or he's going to do is going to have anything to do with it, it's just going to (snapping fingers), right?
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Crossing the street get run over by a truck.
CLIENT: M-hmm. I can't stand to be [walking into...all this.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: You can't stand looking (ph)?
CLIENT: [You know, longer than.] (ph) (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: [Longer than.] (ph)
CLIENT: M-hmm. [silence from 0:43:50.5 to 0:44:09.0] It must have something to do it the way that I like start (ph) thinking about myself or don't do something because I just feel, "Oh well, I can't do anything about it alone (ph). Oh well, I'll take the easy way out." And that's, maybe that's the same kind of thing.
COUNSELOR: Like his dying or your dying would sort of like be a kind of simple ending to the whole thing?
CLIENT: M-hmm, oh, yeah, I talked about that before.
COUNSELOR: Yeah (ph)? 
CLIENT: Yeah. But see why I should think that today or yesterday or something after school... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...that doesn't make as much sense, sense to me as feeling it like over the summer.
COUNSELOR: Thought something [with strange forces] (ph) you mean?
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: So maybe you were thinking about this one (ph)?
CLIENT: I've thought about it unconsciously [through a lot.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: About his or your dying (ph)?
CLIENT: Oh, yeah.
COUNSELOR: You mean like you're not getting back together again, it sounds like it's been very paramount to you?
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah and, um, it doesn't, it doesn't do any good that, um, any reassurances that he gives me aren't really good either.
COUNSELOR: Are you sure you've seen the last of him?
CLIENT: M-hmm. [silence from 0:45:52.1 to 0:46:36.8] I think that about my grandmother too but that makes more sense to me because I know she's old.
COUNSELOR: Right. [silence from 0:46:42.0 to 0:47:34.2] So then if you're thinking about, if we were talking before... 
CLIENT: My grandmother.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, I said that I was thinking that, um, I didn't think about it with such intensity or I was thinking that I think about that with my parents too, like they're away this week, and, um, I mean that it crosses my head but it's not, uh, with the same intensity as it is for whatever boyfriend I have at the time, for sure.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: It's like anybody can meet you at any time and you're going to [meet with them.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: M-hmm, yeah, like so they're going to have the general thing in this, the thing that...happens with grandparents and your grandmother or with you're mother and stepfather, but it's like something different with your boyfriends like to accept it, uh, and with elaboration you're dwelling on it... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...[I guess] (ph) it's different... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...or that a fact of life or something to do with your destiny [it feels like?] (ph)
CLIENT: Hmm.
COUNSELOR: I don't mean to offend... [inaudible at 0:48:47.6] ...do the best we can do with this whole process. [silence from 0:48:52.9 to 0:49:04.8]
CLIENT: See I stopped thinking about everything I think, um, when I can't think of anything else to say then I just, uh, don't want to think about it anymore and then I'm [wondering why I think the way I think.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: The way you say that to me makes me think like you, I should respond to what a bad girl you are or something, you're saying, "See what I do? See how awful I am?"
CLIENT: Not awful, I think it's wrong though to be and, uh, or it bothers me that I do that.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh. [0:49:35.3]
CLIENT: Because like I say the same things over and over and that's all.
COUNSELOR: So? I'm convinced of funny kind of things, like I, this doesn't ring with what's happened for me, I'm kind of, certainly haven't been aware of your saying the same things over and over again, yet (ph) you've experienced that though, correct (ph)?
CLIENT: Oh, like the dying, I've talked about that before, I have.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you have but... 
CLIENT: And, um, I didn't say anything different.
COUNSELOR: Oh, well I don't know, like... 
CLIENT: (chuckling) I don't' know.
COUNSELOR: ...it sounds to me like you did. But that's, I mean the point is, I don't want to argue with you but it's just... [overlapping laughter at 0:50:18.7] ...that you're the one that...like for you, you didn't (ph) and that's an important thing but, it's just funny and it's trite (ph) to me.
CLIENT: What?
COUNSELOR: That you experience you so differently.
CLIENT: Than you?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, from my experience with you. Like I think if I had the same kinds of feelings about you that you have about you I'd be down on you too... 
CLIENT: (chuckling) Right.
COUNSELOR: ...with like how you repeat the same stuff endlessly.
CLIENT: But I really don't think that I hear anything different.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Or maybe, um, whatever I've said before seems already like knowledge to me or something.
COUNSELOR: [Like became that ground on it?] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Can I see that? I think the other people sound... 
COUNSELOR: [Afraid to hear?] (ph)
CLIENT: Well (ph), [silence from 0:51:30.7 to 0:52:01.3] What was different about the dying? (chuckling) I said before, I was afraid of people dying because they were going to leave me and it was an easy out, and I don't know if I said anything about my grandmother and my parents, I probably do... 
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: ...but that wasn't important.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Before I tell you, I want to tell you what just hit me, but I could appreciate that what you think inside, it must sound to you like you've drone (ph) on and on and on.
CLIENT: To me!
COUNSELOR: Yeah?
CLIENT: Yeah but not drone.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Um, I don't know, like there are a number of things that hit me though and I want to respond to them for you, and one was do you have a sense for how it sort of like very - no, for a sense of how you were kind of, like how could we for, um, ah, (snapping fingers twice) well it's like you might be run-of-the-mill or a garden variety but it's maybe the last word is fatalistic but there's another like take for granted fatalistic... [0:53:01.4]
CLIENT: Mm.
COUNSELOR: ...taking for granted fatalistic... 
CLIENT: Mm.
COUNSELOR: ...that's number one...like that's how you live your life... 
CLIENT: Mm, mm.
COUNSELOR: ...that one day they will. The other part of it is like how different, that there's a different edge with James... 
CLIENT: Mm.
COUNSELOR: ...or was with Drew or whomever and that's like some kind of elaboration that you do inside and kind of examine different facets... 
CLIENT: Mm.
COUNSELOR: ...and...like one fantasy I have, and I guess I'm having right now, I mean like before it was like a sort of going through the funeral or something like that.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah, I've done that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Oh, yes!
COUNSELOR: Yeah, so that's what felt different to me.
CLIENT: Mm.
COUNSELOR: Did that ring?
CLIENT: Well see I knew about the difference, maybe I didn't... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...say anything, but since I knew it maybe I decided... 
COUNSELOR: [Get it.] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it's like you, because you already said it then you think. Yeah, so the point, I guess that explains the difference between your perception of you and my perception of you, because like to me that was weird (ph). [silence from 0:54:05.8 to 0:54:17.4] It must be pretty discouraging for you.
CLIENT: What?
COUNSELOR: To not finish and not thinking and everything (ph).
CLIENT: (chuckling) M-hmm. Uh-huh. Um, no, that's not what's discouraging, what's discouraging is that, um, I always feel that I get to a certain point and then I stop thinking about it.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm and what's discouraging is you give up each time?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: What did you give up on?
CLIENT: Today?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: A whole, everything I talked about.
COUNSELOR: Oh, uh, okay.
CLIENT: Yeah or that's how I felt. Like I don't even know, I know what I started out talking about and I don't think it was useful more usually.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. [silence from 0:55:17.0 to 0:55:39.9] So that sounds like today is a blank for you except for the very beginning?
CLIENT: No. No, it will come back... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...but it takes a while, it comes back slowly, it always does that.
COUNSELOR: It's always happening in the hour it's like you've lost it, you can't remember it. [0:56:01.6]
CLIENT: Particularly (ph) like that, no, but that's always true.
COUNSELOR: Mm. Oh, like what do you mean, always true in life or always choosing?
CLIENT: Always choosing.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: In like in my life I don't remember a lot of things either though. I read a lot of things...what other people tell me and after they tell me I might remember, then one I might not. [silence from 0:56:31.4 to 0:56:45.6] I read a book, there was something in that book, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater.
COUNSELOR: God bless you who?
CLIENT: Mr. Rosewater, by Isabella Duncan?
COUNSELOR: It beats the hell out of me.
CLIENT: Oh, oh, and anyway like I just thought about it, it just came into my head again... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...where he tells his, I think, psychiatrist, everyday he goes in and, and sings songs to him and stuff.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And I was just thinking that I was like that in a, and not in say, in a way to myself I'm like that.
COUNSELOR: So it's in what way?
CLIENT: Because I, um, how I feel about myself is that if I, after I say something that's happened or something and I talk a little bit about it... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...then it's like, um, I stop and I don't want to think about it anymore because I don't want to get out before it what I'm really feeling or something and then I it's just very sad.
COUNSELOR: So it sounds like you can kind of, after you get... [inaudible at 0:57:59.1] ...like maybe what you have is an attic and that you're stuck on the attic floor [when you're up there because the basement's better because the stuff on the attic floor is you think it through and you think it through and it's a trapdoor and the trapdoor is open, then all the sudden it just closes, like you don't want to go down there and deal with it?] (ph)
CLIENT: M-hmm. The basement is nasty though, I'd rather be in the attic. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah. But the sense I have for you is like just clamming up inside sort of like to yourself.
CLIENT: Yes. [silence from 0:58:35.0 to 0:58:45.7] And that's where the confusion comes in because I say that, at least that's where silent (ph) confusion comes in, because I say that there, um, there's something more to that I want to think about and I can't and so then I tell myself, "well there really isn't anything more to think", whatever that is. [0:59:10.8]
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And the confusion is whether there really is or?
CLIENT: Some type, yeah, sometimes. You see I really feel that a lot of things that, um, that I probably have more to say about things that I'm, I'm not aware of and I don't let myself become aware of.
COUNSELOR: (snapping fingers) [inaudible at 0:59:38.8]... 
CLIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... 
CLIENT: And so I then tell myself that there really isn't anything more, I don't have to worry about it.
COUNSELOR: You know what it sounds like?
CLIENT: No (ph)?
COUNSELOR: It sounds like... [inaudible at 0:59:49.3] ...it sounds like having a name on the tip of your tongue and not being able to remember it.
CLIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: And then saying something to yourself like, "Well there wasn't any name to begin with so I might as well forget that."
CLIENT: (chuckling) M-hmm, that's exactly right and that, (sighing) and so then that makes me feel that there are all these things on the periphery and there is no inside of me, so it becomes, and it, and that all comes to mind, I guess.
COUNSELOR: [You guess?] (ph)
CLIENT: (big sigh) It seems at the moment that in time it all comes about anyway.
COUNSELOR: Yeah and that the underlying thing in that is something like it all comes about because when you can't focus you then say, "well there's nothing really to focus on anyway".
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: There isn't any, really anyone (ph) inside?
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: The thing you twisted in that, for me anyway, is like there really is something you're really using inside that it really is for it... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ..."there really is a name on the tip of my tongue".
CLIENT: M-hmm. I think that I really feel like that but because I kind of - then I tell myself two things about that, um, that there isn't... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and, um, that it's vain of me to think that, vain.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And, um... 
COUNSELOR: Hurtful (ph)?
CLIENT: Yeah, that's, that's all.
COUNSELOR: That it's presumptuous of you to feel like there's a center to you?
CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah, uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Where do you come off or you come off with something inside? When the hell are you going to have these, something more than a grab bag of contradictory impulses, in other words? [silence from 1:02:04.7 to 1:02:26.2]
CLIENT: I know that I have an argument for you but I can't think of what it is.
COUNSELOR: Is that because it feels right? I mean like you have intellectual arguments and I stated it a little schematically that... 
CLIENT: No, no. I know that, um, somewhere racing around in my mind is an argument to tell you that you're, you're, um, that actually you were being specific or sarcastic or something and actually you're right, somehow, that was the argument.
COUNSELOR: I thought the argument was I was wrong! And you're saying I'm right?
CLIENT: But you were being sarcastic.
COUNSELOR: No.
CLIENT: No?
COUNSELOR: No, I was like, I wasn't, no, I wasn't being sarcastic.
CLIENT: No it's not sarcastic then it's all just... 
COUNSELOR: [You know it's...] (ph)
CLIENT: ...ironic.
COUNSELOR: Ironic, but I wasn't, I wanted to be straight and I was, like that sounded like that edge of it for you, like it really does feel presumptuous?
CLIENT: Yeah! Yeah, okay... 
COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:03:44.8]... 
CLIENT: ...I'm confused, I can confuse myself, yes.
COUNSELOR: That's all I was saying about it was that there's something about, I mean you really feel like you're riding for a fall to think you have some kind of core (ph)... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...[in all of this stuff you know.] (ph) [silence from 1:03:58.7 to 1:04:13.3] Where are you?
CLIENT: So I was thinking though it doesn't matter.
COUNSELOR: I must say it's even like a presumptuous kind of waste of time to even talk about, I mean...whether [in not caring mires into an inside] (ph) or a core, whatever that is [unless I'm straight,] (ph) I mean what the hell difference does it make?
CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah, like it's a waste of time.
CLIENT: See but I really don't feel that it is, you know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Instead I want, um, I want to do that but I just don't, I get stuck along the way.
COUNSELOR: [What do you mean?] (ph)
CLIENT: And when I get stuck it's on the self thing, it's wrong, it doesn't matter, it's presumptuous, it's painful.
COUNSELOR: It seems like when you hit an obstacle your first kind of impulse is to doubt the whole thing, doubt the whole endeavor?
CLIENT: Probably or to tell myself it doesn't matter. [1:05:28.5]
COUNSELOR: That's what I mean... 
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...that, "If it doesn't matter... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...why am I doing this anyway?"
CLIENT: M-hmm. [silence from 1:05:33.6 to 1:05:47.6]
COUNSELOR: We should be stopping.
CLIENT: Yes sir. [Now I'm really overcoming that.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: Yeah (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah (ph).
COUNSELOR: [Not telling me?] (ph) Today is the... 
CLIENT: The 25th.
COUNSELOR: ...25th.
CLIENT: I think. Oh, no, I don't remember if it is. I didn't have to write it on the board today, I don't remember what day it is anymore (ph). I'd bet it's the 24th.
COUNSELOR: [You think today is the 24th?] (ph)
CLIENT: Oh. (yawning) [silence from 1:06:30.5 to 1:06:58.0]
COUNSELOR: Have a good vacation.
CLIENT: Thank you. [I fear it's going to have any more to do with...] (ph) [silence from 1:07:02.8 to 1:07:14.7] [I expected to leave my purse.] Mm! (chuckling) The whole thing was, was that last year I preached (ph) to my parents on 40 different colors of room (ph) but it's completely... [inaudible]
COUNSELOR: Okay (ph).
CLIENT: ...and how it would look good.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. [inaudible]... 
CLIENT: You know, oh, it always sticks, oh, [I think I do it.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: Have a good vacation. [silence from 1:07:43.3 to end - 1:07:50.3]
