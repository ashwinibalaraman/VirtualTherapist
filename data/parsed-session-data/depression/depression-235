BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Ignore the tape recorder.  So, it was hot in, uh, Maryland?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I just woke up.
<b>DR:</b>	It was hot on vacation?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, it was awful.
<b>DR:</b>	Not even cooler by the ocean?  Not even cooler by the ocean?
<b>PT:</b>	No, it was hot, really hot.  I didn't mind it too bad though.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  How's your wife doing?
<b>PT:</b>	Bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Was she with you?  I know—
<b>PT:</b>	She got the cancer.  I, I don't think she's going to make it.  That's my opinion.  The doctor's won't tell her nothing until she gets a PET scan next week.
<b>DR:</b>	Has she had treatment for it?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she did.  She done 42 radiations and all the chemos that go with it.
<b>DR:</b>	Is she seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] that group?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Did they give you feedback or say anything?
<b>PT:</b>	Did they what?
<b>DR:</b>	Give you any feedback, like how she's doing—
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Or response or anything?
<b>PT:</b>	They say keep your fingers crossed.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	That's all they say.  She had a lot of cancer pain, you know, from the tumor and everything.  They had her on Oxycontin, 180 Percosets, 2 every 4 hours, something like that, a lot.  Well, they, they backed that down to 100 and then they backed it down to, uh, now she's on, they backed it down to 120 every, 120 a month, they backed that down.  Her family doctor was giving her, uh, 40 mg of, uh, Oxycontin.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So I told [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] you know I want to, because you're the doctor, but her family doctor increased it.  I just wanted him to know because you're not allowed to get it off of two different doctors.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, uh, 2 different types of pain pills.
<b>PT:</b>	So, all of a sudden her doctor, family doctor calls her up, she gets for 3 months right, called her up and said, uh, I can no longer give you Oxycontin, you have to go to [INAUDIBLE].  So that's no problem because [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] will take that over.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, sure, if [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is prescribing the other pain medication, he doesn't want to step on that.
<b>PT:</b>	She's not having that cancer pain.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, she's having back problems, and then she's having a problem using the Xanax again.  And I don't know what to do about that.  She went over to, uh, her daughter's house.  Doctor gave her a prescription for 120 half mg of Xanax.  Within one week, they're gone.  And she's going through this [INAUDIBLE] shit and all this stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	Is she taking them or is she—
<b>PT:</b>	She's taking them.
<b>DR:</b>	Is she giving them to her daughter?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So she ran out.  So she went over her daughter's house and bought 30 1 mg tablets and that's what did it.  She got all bezerk last night.  I woke up in the middle of the night.  She had coffee all over the kitchen.  Uh, we have this package of coffee containers.  It was on the burner all burnt up.  I mean what a mess.  Uh, she takes her pocketbook.  She can't find her pocketbook.  She takes 120 Percosets and hid them somewhere.  She can't find them.  She takes the Oxycontin that she had left, hid them, can't find them and blaming me for it.  So she calls the police this morning, and told the cop I got all her pills.  Well, of course, after the cop got done talking to her, he said no way, I don't believe that.  He didn't believe, he believed me.
<b>DR:</b>	Probably would be a good idea for you to have them actually, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	I wish I did.  I could give them back to her.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, who's prescribing the Xanax again?
<b>PT:</b>	Huh?
<b>DR:</b>	Who prescribed the Xanax?
<b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and he had problems prescribing the Oxycontin?
<b>PT:</b>	He didn't, for the first 3 months, he didn't have no problem, but something happened in between.
<b>DR:</b>	Because you have to be careful using the, the benzos, the Xanax with the long acting—
<b>PT:</b>	"Well the next thing I believe is they cut her off the Xanax.	"
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	He's going to stop it, I believe it.
<b>DR:</b>	If he stopped the Oxycontin, I can't imagine he'd continue the Xanax just unmonitored, you know, if that was his reason or that was his concern, but I think he needs to know too that, you know, with everything else going on, whether it's the, the cancer itself or it's probably one of the medications that she's not thinking clearly.  You know, that her thinking is off.
<b>PT:</b>	No, she's not.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	She's going, she's going—
<b>DR:</b>	Just like she did before.
<b>PT:</b>	That's why I had to 302 her before.
<b>DR:</b>	And that was all related to the medications.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, for the most part.
<b>PT:</b>	They had her in the hospital.  I 302ed her.
<b>DR:</b>	I remember, but then she left before—
<b>PT:</b>	No, she—
<b>DR:</b>	She stayed there?
<b>PT:</b>	She stayed the course.
<b>DR:</b>	Seventy two hours or—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she stayed the course and, uh, they came to the conclusion that she took too much Xanax.  Uh, they put her on the Duragesic patch and they recommended her to stay on the patch.  Well [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] wasn't here last week when we went down there.  His assistant was, some lady, she's a real bitch.  I hate her.  So she goes and reads the record, she says oh, you're not supposed to have Oxycontin, all this stuff.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] must have not have read this report.  Well, she wrote the script anyway.  I said what about the Xanax?  I says it wasn't even due yet, and she said well, uh, I called it in to the drugstore.  Well she didn't.  She, she just didn't want to tell her no.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	She can't take anything like that, Xanax, even Bena, they gave her Benadryl at the chemo center because she had a bad reaction from the chemo.  That made her hallucinate.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, and I think the Xanax with the other pain medication can affect her breathing among other things too.  So it is best she try to stay away from it.
<b>PT:</b>	I went into, I went into the bedroom last night.  She took a whole glass of water into the bedroom last night.  I said what's she doing, right.  So I waited a few minutes and walked in there.  She has a whole bottle of, uh, ibuprofen, a whole handful of ibuprofen, she's taking one at a time, one at a time.  Then I grabbed her hand.  I said what are you doing?  I said give me that.  So I pried her hand open and there's all these, uh, ibuprofens.  I took them and threw them in the backyard and anything else I could find in the house that she could take.  Then she found dexamethasone.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	She started to take them 1 at a time.  I took them and threw them out the door.
<b>DR:</b>	And she wasn't trying to hurt herself?
<b>PT:</b>	She is.
<b>DR:</b>	Or was she just abusing them?
<b>PT:</b>	She's trying, she says she wants to die, and I'm stuck in the middle and I'm going half crazy.  I don't know what to do.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean if it gets that bad like it had before, I mean you know about the 302.
<b>PT:</b>	That's a pain in the butt.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  You know—
<b>PT:</b>	How am I going to prove it?  I, I called the place and all this stuff and tell them what she's doing, it's her word against mine.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, if you filed a Petition and you go over and fill out the Petition, for example, like you go over to [DEIDENTIFIED], you know where that is?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  If you go over there and just, you know, present what you were saying—
<b>PT:</b>	I ain't doing it.
<b>DR:</b>	The Petition is the part that—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not doing it.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	If she wants to die, let her die.  I, I can't live like this.  Then I started going back in depression again.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I know.
<b>PT:</b>	And then, then the bills, we just got a bill from, uh, radiology for $4,000.  Apparently the insurance company don't pay for it.
<b>DR:</b>	For radiology?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah 4 grand, $4,000.
<b>DR:</b>	For the workup of her cancer, the insurance didn't pay for that?
<b>PT:</b>	I haven't gotten nothing from the insurance.  The insurance doesn't hand out any [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	That is odd.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not paying none of them.  We got bills over there for about $8,000.
<b>DR:</b>	That's very strange.
<b>PT:</b>	We're going to have some big time money problems especially with her acting like this.  You know, like I said, after we come back from Maryland, I started getting a little depressed.
<b>DR:</b>	She went to Maryland though with you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and she left me there.  She took the train home.  It took 2 days.  I'm taking a nap in the bed.  Next thing I knew her suitcases were gone there and she went off.  She was taking the Xanax.  She gets nuts.  Took a train home and left me hanging down there.  So I stayed for 2 more days.  I ought to divorce her.  I should.
<b>DR:</b>	It's been an up and down road as long as I've known you.
<b>PT:</b>	She's okay if she stays away from the Xanax.  That's the only thing that does it to her, the only thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Although with all of that pain medication too, I always wonder, you know, if it's the combo of everything right now.
<b>PT:</b>	She, that's the one thing I cannot understand.  She does not abuse the Percosets or the oxycodone.  To me, if I was a drug addict, that would be my choice.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  When you look at it, people have different addictions to different kinds of things.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know what they get out of swallowing all those Xanax.
<b>DR:</b>	But I think—
<b>PT:</b>	But anyway—
<b>DR:</b>	If there's a way to let [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] office know your concerns.  I mean then you can leave it up to them on how, how they, you know, so that they aren't continuing to prescribe something [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Well, she bought 30 Xanax off her daughter and then they were in the cabinet and I, I was doing something, she went back to look in the cabinet, she starts screaming where's my Xanax at?  I said I don't know where they are.  She said you got them in your pocket.  You took them, and all this stuff, right.  So I let her search me and I said I don't have your Xanax, right?  I'm looking all over the house and I found them, 30 of them, and guess what, she ain't getting them back.
<b>DR:</b>	Um.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm sorry, I'm not giving them back to her.  They don't belong to her.  She wasn't prescribed it.  I'm not giving them back to her.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I've been, I've been, I've been without a Xanax now for 10 days.  I've had no Xanax.  I went through withdrawal, shaking, sick to my stomach because she took them too.  She took mine.
<b>DR:</b>	She took yours?
<b>PT:</b>	She got a hold of mine.
<b>DR:</b>	Were the ones that she purchased the same as her strength?
<b>PT:</b>	What's that?
<b>DR:</b>	The ones that you're holding of hers now—
<b>PT:</b>	She ain't getting them.
<b>DR:</b>	But if she took yours, you didn't take any of the, of the ones that you found of hers?
<b>PT:</b>	I did, I needed it.
<b>DR:</b>	But you've been out of them for 10 days?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You've been off of them for 10 days?
<b>PT:</b>	Been off of them for 10 days.
<b>DR:</b>	So you didn't take any of hers during this last 10 days?
<b>PT:</b>	Of mine?
<b>DR:</b>	Of hers to substitute.
<b>PT:</b>	I did?
<b>DR:</b>	No, did you take hers over the last 10 days—
<b>PT:</b>	I took them today.
<b>DR:</b>	Substituting—
<b>PT:</b>	Took them last night.  I found them last night.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] last night.  Okay, so you went for 9 days without [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I took them because I was shaking and getting sick and getting depressed and everything and I took that Xanax, it straightened me right out.
<b>DR:</b>	And she knows that you take Xanax, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I usually keep mine locked in the safe, but before we went for vacation, I took out enough I needed for vacation.  Apparently, I left them on the desk and by the time we got to Maryland and then came back, all my Xanax were gone.  So she must have grabbed them off the desk or something.  And they were just filled [DATE], 120.  I, I get more today.  I'm going to call [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] because my prescription's due and there's no refills.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean one thing to consider would be to tell [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] too how tough this has been.  Maybe he can give you, instead of giving 120, maybe he can write your prescription in smaller amounts.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't need small amount, 120 works fine for me.
<b>DR:</b>	If you have 120 tablets sitting around the house.
<b>PT:</b>	They're in the, they're usually locked up in the safe.
<b>DR:</b>	I know.  They're usually, but this time they weren't, and your wife got a hold of them, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, I mean one way of getting around that so you don't suffer.  Well, you can, uh, just pick up 30 at a time or pick up just, you know, a few week's worth at a time.  Keep them locked up so there's always some, you know, in a safe place, the pharmacy, so that you have access to them, you know what I mean?  Not to keep any large amounts around your house.  Although, you know, no matter what you do there, if she really wants to get them, obviously she has her daughter to buy them off of.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, once a month she can buy them off her daughter.  Her daughter gets them off of [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Everybody goes to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] for Xanax.
<b>DR:</b>	You go to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Well he recommended it for my stomach and stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, just be careful with having yours around the house at all.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know how that happened.  See what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] did was, I didn't even know it, right, he wrote it out for 60 by mistake.  I'm going to the drugstore and I'm getting 60, right.  I don't even look at the label.  Put them in the safe.  Go in there and get what I want.  The last time I went in the safe, I says half of these are gone, and I'm thinking, I said [INAUDIBLE].  So then I looked at the, and I, I was getting along with 60 a month, right, because I was trying to ration them because I couldn't figure out where the rest of them went.  I looked at the label here, it says 60.  So I called [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] up, I said you made a mistake.  You're supposed to give me 120.  He said you're right, and he corrected it and they gave me the other 60, but I was fine.  For about 2 months, I was getting along with 60.
<b>DR:</b>	Getting along with just 2 a day?
<b>PT:</b>	Huh?  Yeah—
<b>DR:</b>	Two a day.
<b>PT:</b>	Two a day.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's a good sign though.  I mean if you were doing okay with 2 a day, maybe you want to try to also talk to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] about keeping it at the lowest dose possible.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but this proved to me I needed it.  I mean I, I went, I was, I was throwing up—
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	My stomach hurt.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  I mean you don't want to go off of it cold turkey, but you know, if it's what 4 a day versus 2 a day and you do fine with 2 a day, then 2 a day might help keep your supply out of the house is what I'm thinking, keep a smaller amounts.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know how that happened.  I don't know how she got her hands on them.  She takes it because she wants to sleep, but then she gets, uh, she gets violent, calling the cops and telling them I took her pills and all that kind of stuff and I beat her up.  She's doing dishes, she banged her hand and cut her hand open, she told the cop I beat her up.  The cop didn't even note it because he seen what kind of shape she was in, but I'm getting tired of this.  If I could just get her off that Xanax perfectly, she'd be perfect.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, my guess maybe some of this dysfunction's a little more since the cancer diagnosis too.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, the cancer's working on her mind.
<b>DR:</b>	Is she going to talk to somebody or seeing somebody on her own?  I mean she doesn't see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] or a therapist or anything?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean this would be the time of any time for her to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	She won't do it.  She keeps screaming I want to die.  I want to die.  She probably will.  You have a 1 in 4 chance of making it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, everyone does eventually die.  So there's some truth in your statement, but you know, is it going to be the cancer or is it going to be her own hand.
<b>PT:</b>	I really don't care one way or the other right now.
<b>DR:</b>	You're angry with her?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Very angry.
<b>PT:</b>	But you, you wouldn't believe the abuse I take and I keep my mouth shut.
<b>DR:</b>	Well you know if it gets really bad, you know what's there.  It helped the last time that you filled out the 302.
<b>PT:</b>	What's the last time what?
<b>DR:</b>	It helped the last time you filled out a 302.  It straightened things out for her and just—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I can't prove that she's a danger to herself.  You have, you have to prove it.
<b>DR:</b>	If you're saying that, that she is taking too many pills and she's overdosing at home, and the next time she does that, that's when you go and you get the Petition, the police come and they find the pills there and then they take her to the hospital and let the docs then decide if she stays there.
<b>PT:</b>	They won't do it.
<b>DR:</b>	Who's that?
<b>PT:</b>	The people that do, the judge.  They, they won't do it.  See the last time I [INAUDIBLE] she was completely out of her mind.  She was walking the streets, walked up the hospital.  She wanted to go in the hospital, right.
<b>DR:</b>	So the next time that, that she's like that, obviously, you know, that's one thing that you can do.
<b>PT:</b>	She gets in a car and went out and crashed a car.  She crashed every car we had.  Then she says oh, I did that on purpose.  She said I want to make you spend every money you, you've got before I die.  We're in financial trouble now.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	With all the, with all the medical bills now, I can't pay it.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't, I can't buy no more Abilify.  Absolutely cannot buy no more Abilify.  Her, her one prescription costs $500.  Her Oxycontin costs $326 because she's in that donut hole now.
<b>DR:</b>	Um.  She is?
<b>PT:</b>	She is.
<b>DR:</b>	You are as well?
<b>PT:</b>	Not me, I'm not [AGE].  She's in that donut hole.  You're talking over $1,000 a month just for her prescriptions.  I can't buy it no more.
<b>DR:</b>	Does she have Abilify also?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	No, okay.  I've given you samples before.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I cannot afford it no more.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're asking me for samples?
<b>PT:</b>	If you want to give them to me.  We're, we're in financial trouble.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean I think this is probably not the time for you to go off the Abilify either, especially if you're feeling more depressed.  Did you stop it?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b>	I increased it.
<b>DR:</b>	What, what strength are you taking?
<b>PT:</b>	From five to 10.  You, you told me if anything should—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  So when did you increase it?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, 4 days ago.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay and does, does it seem to help a little bit or hard to tell?  It may be too soon.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't tell.
<b>DR:</b>	So 10 mg.  Let me see if I have anymore here.  If I don't, then I'll call down to, to [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I'm stupid.  I'm stupid for putting up with this.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, why, why do you think you do?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, she's a good girl when she, when she ain't acting like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How many years have you been married now?
<b>PT:</b>	Over 30 years, 35 years.
<b>DR:</b>	I think you, I mean obviously you know that divorce is always an option.
<b>PT:</b>	A couple days later she'll give me all this story stuff.  She doesn't remember what she does.  She says I don't remember what I did.
<b>DR:</b>	These are 10 mg and these are some samples actually that a little different than what you normally take because this is called Abilify Discmelt.  It's a dissolvable tablet.  So it's the same 10 mg.  The only difference is that it dissolves in your mouth, on your tongue.  You know, it's an orally disintegrating tablet.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't see what it does because I, I wasn't going to take anymore after I seen you.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, again, when you have bipolar and you're depressed, you need to take something and this is the one that's helped the best.  Antidepressants really didn't make a big difference and there's two medications, Abilify and Seroquel that are both choices for bipolar depression.  Seroquel you were too sedated with, remember?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That's why Abilify.  You know, and again we talked the last time if the stress got worse, you could increase it which you did.  Give it some time.  You know, it's been, and this is just 1 tablet a day and it's something that you're doing for your depression.  It doesn't change the environment around you.  It doesn't change her illness.  It doesn't change the anger at her.  It may change your response to it so you don't, it doesn't get out of control for you and so you don't end up having more dysfunction during this time so you hold it together, but that's why, why the Abilify.  That's a month's worth I believe there.
<b>PT:</b>	I, I don't know if I'm depressed or, or the things that happen around me make me depressed.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, the end result is if the things are happening around you that make you depressed or feeling depressed and feeling distress, then it's depressed nonetheless because it can happen just from nothing, or it can happen from the environment around you, but the end result is, is how it affects you and your body, you know, whether it's intrinsic from the inside or extrinsic from the outside.  The end result is the same feeling if you know what I mean.  And you definitely have a full plate once again.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, at least you were able to get away to [DEIDENTIFIED] for a little bit, and it was 2 days by itself.  Well, it was too hot.
<b>PT:</b>	I didn't have much fun.  Then I had to drive home through all those eastern thunderstorms.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	All I had was sunglasses.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	It was a 580 mile trip.  That made me mad when she left there.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that doesn't, I mean she didn't even say anything.  She just left?
<b>PT:</b>	She said she wanted to leave.  I said I'm not going, I paid $1,000—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	For the hotel, I said I'm not leaving.  This is after 2 days.  I said I'm not leaving here.  I said what's wrong with you?  She said I want to go home.  I don't like this place.  She was all hepped up the one that wanted to go down there, but we go there every year for like 25 years.  I mean we know, we know it like we know [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, sure.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean we went out to dinner and ate and we were sitting at the dinner table, she says, you know what, she says I look at you and I say boy, I love that man.  That made me feel so good, right.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And then in a split second, she changes like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Well maybe what you're seeing is the effects of the illness and the Xanax and everything else.
<b>PT:</b>	I've got to get her, I got to call her doctor and I'm going to tell him no more Xanax.  That's, I tracked it down to exactly what does it.  Every, every time talk to you, she's flipped out and it's all over Xanax.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I think you can obviously let him know your concern and what you're observing.  Even if he stops prescribing it, she still has access to it with her daughter.  You just have to be very vigilant on your own, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	I'll call her daughter.  If I tell her daughter not to give it to her, her daughter won't do it.  She has a lot of respect for me, her daughter.  And she said oh boy, she said once a month now, I can get it off of [NAME OTHER] and I don't need no doctor.  Well, she only gets 30.  Thirty pills will last her 3 days.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean she definitely has an addiction.
<b>PT:</b>	Well what do they see in that?
<b>DR:</b>	It sounds like for your wife it helps her sleep things away.
<b>PT:</b>	All she wants to do is sleep.  I know she has a lot on her mind about the, about the, uh, the cancer.  She don't know whether she's going to live or die, but at the cancer center where she was doing her radiation doing the last treatments, the doctor came out, you know, one of [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] partners and he told her, he said you're going to live a long, long time.  That's what he told her, you're going to live a long time.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	He said I'm very optimistic.  So they must see something on those CT scans when they're doing the, uh, radiation for her, for them to say that.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, if the next step is the PET scan.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, next week.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, and then going and following up.  You know, when you go, ask questions.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  She has lots of questions.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	The last chemo she took, she started throwing up.  She couldn't take it and they gave her that Benadryl.  That, that got her hallucinating.  She can't take the Benadryl because she used to go out and get these sleeping pills, they have Benadryl in it and she used to hallucinate.  Well she doesn't take one.  She takes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's the problem is that she overuses it [INAUDIBLE].  Well, um, should we set up another visit then for next month?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we better.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, here's the samples then.  Thank you.
