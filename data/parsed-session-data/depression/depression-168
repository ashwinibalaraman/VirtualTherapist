<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] how have you been doing?
<b>PT:</b> Okay, having bad sleep 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. 
<b>PT:</b> And seems like a little bit more depressed than usual.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. You want to tell me about it?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t really know why I’m feeling this way.
<b>DR:</b>  Well, try to fill me in.
<b>PT:</b> I’m feeling a little lonely, not wanted, but…
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. Want to tell me about that?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know, it just doesn’t seem like I’m the person that somebody would really want to be with.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm, why do you feel that way?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know, I felt like that for a long time, cause I don’t if it is because my family or is it because of me being raped by my daughter’s father I don’t know. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know exactly where its from.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Because my family treated me like a, you know, like I’m an outcast, certain people in this family does.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. Tell me some more about that.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I’ve been like that for, both my grandmothers ever, ever since my, both of them act like I was so dumb and not good enough I guess to be in the family or to be recognized in the family because my youngest sister, she had all the praise everything,
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. Why was that?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know. I guess they both favored her, not sure.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. And mean, why, there must have been some reason.
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know the reason. Anything I, anything my sister did I had to do it with my mother’s mother. Anything she did, she called her one time out of her name, I got the worst beating my mother didn’t really whoop my sister for saying it because I tried to tell her that I wasn’t the one doing it. She said I know you’re the one who did it. I know that wasn’t her because she, she’s too sweet. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know why I was
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> So, they were all like that while my um, grandmother was there with me with my mother. 
<b>DR:</b> There’s always a difference when…
<b>PT:</b> And then when I go down to my dad’s house there’s a difference. 
<b>DR:</b> Tell me about that
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know she used to always think I was just so dumb because they’d be like, nah, nah, you need to listen, and do that and I’m the oldest. Me and her is the same age until tomorrow 
<b>DR:</b> So you, you’re about a year older than she is?
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm. She’s definitely treating me like I was just dumb, didn’t know how to do anything [INAUDIBLE], she got it, she’d know how to do it, you don’t know how to do it. 
<b>DR:</b> Feels kind of embarrassing for you.
<b>PT:</b> But I still went over there. 
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> Because she’s trying to make me think I can’t do it, this is what turn on the TV or something real simple. And she tries to make like I’m just so dumb, couldn’t do it. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. She really made a big difference between the two of you?
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Tell me some more about growing up.
<b>PT:</b> Hmm, that’s how it mostly was from growing up. I guess my mother started out showing favoritism cause she was a baby. If she was crying, she just paid attention to her.
<b>DR:</b> She got all the attention.
<b>PT:</b> Yes. 
<b>DR:</b> But there wasn’t much difference in your ages?
<b>PT:</b> That’s the reason I guess I’m, I was so crazy about my aunt. Because she always you know took up some time with me.
<b>DR:</b> Paid you attention.
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm. And there’s one that’s deceased, she’s another one, but she stayed in [DEIDENTIFIED] so she couldn’t give me as much attention as that one could. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> But she did, when she did, you know, came around. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. Okay, some more about growing up.
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know. 
<b>DR:</b> Now, you mentioned that you had uh, gotten raped.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I had met him at...
<b>DR:</b> How old were you at the time?
<b>PT:</b> I’m not sure, well, about; I was just getting out of school, probably about [AGE], [AGE]. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> [AGE] or [AGE]. 
<b>DR:</b> What happened?
<b>PT:</b> He told me he wanted me to come over just for dinner. I didn’t know anybody wasn’t going to be at home or nothing. But I went on over there because I was like finally, I got somebody that want me. But I guess he really didn’t.
<b>DR:</b> He gave you attention.
<b>PT:</b> Yes. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And so I went over there and kind of starting talking to him and, and he was supposed [INAUDIBLE] and then he said no and I told him no I didn’t want to do it kept telling him no…
<b>DR:</b> He asked you for sex?
<b>PT:</b> He did, he did try, he just took my clothes down. And he was real big.
<b>DR:</b> How old was he?
<b>PT:</b> I’m not sure because I don’t remember.
<b>DR:</b> Was he much older than you?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, because he was out of, he went to the same school but I think he, he got out way before I did.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And, he, I got pregnant and…
<b>DR:</b> One time?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. And I didn’t believe in abortion.
<b>DR:</b> Now, were you a virgin?
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Hmm, what, what happened then?
<b>PT:</b> We found out that I was pregnant he told me I need to have an abortion.
<b>DR:</b> Who found out you were pregnant?
<b>PT:</b> He did. Because I was still kind of talking to him I guess because I felt like somebody wanted me, but I should have really known that he really didn’t because half of the time he seeing somebody and oh that ain’t my child. And how was it not, and that was my first time. 
<b>DR:</b> He said what?
<b>PT:</b> That was not his child, and he didn’t do…
<b>DR:</b> But I mean you were a virgin girl. Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But anybody that asked him, he said that not my child. 
<b>DR:</b> So he tried to deny it?
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm. 
<b>DR:</b> How did your family-
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> How did your family react to it?
<b>PT:</b> They didn’t know about all that. I didn’t tell. 
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know. But I didn’t tell anybody. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Until now. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. Okay, then what happened?
<b>PT:</b> Well, he was kind of still coming over while I was pregnant, but then he stopped and I didn’t see him almost for a long time. 
<b>DR:</b> What you mean for a long time?
<b>PT:</b> I didn’t see him until recently when I tried to get child support for my daughter because she was [AGE]. She was getting ready to turn [AGE]. 
<b>DR:</b> You did see him?
<b>PT:</b> I probably seen him one time in ninety three. When she, when she was little I don’t know exactly how old she was.
<b>DR:</b> Did he pay support?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> Barely, I don’t, I think sometime he has a poll on how many kids she’s got and all this because they sent me three dollar checks, two dollar checks.
<b>DR:</b> Things have been really difficult for you.
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> He, he wasn’t interested in seeing the child?
<b>PT:</b> He seen her that one time and it was, it was, I didn’t see him when he came cause I was staying with my friend in uh, my niece’s mother, I was staying with her [NAME OTHER] for a minute and he came over there to see her. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. How old was she then?
<b>PT:</b> I’m going to say that was in ninety three, she was born in eighty seven, around five or six, I don’t know, I’m not sure. 
<b>DR:</b> And that was the first time you ever seen him?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I use took her to see her grandmother.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah, what, what about his side of the family, what?
<b>PT:</b> He, he has an older brother I think he comes like sometimes and sometimes she don’t really like living with him, with her daddy. Because he, he about like my daddy, my daddy used to take us places, but if we asked for something we were in trouble. 
<b>DR:</b> What you mean by that?
<b>PT:</b> You know, he used to take us to you know how , you know, like when the Harlem Globe Trotters use to come to town, he would take us and go see them but we could not ask for anything in that place we had eat an hour or something before. He would always do us like that.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. 
<b>PT:</b> And we couldn’t ask for nothing.
<b>DR:</b> So you couldn’t really enjoy the experience.
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm. He took, he let us go to the movies one time and he got us a candy bar out of his car and brought it to the, and told us to go in there, eat that and be satisfied. And I think her daddy is a little cheap like my daddy is sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes he wants to help and then sometimes he don’t. 
<b>DR:</b> What kind of relationship did you have with your daddy?
<b>PT:</b> I used to love being around my daddy but…
<b>DR:</b> How often would he be around?
<b>PT:</b> Well, we used to spend some weekends down there, down at my grandmothers house.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> I used to see him a little bit more, the, you know, when he’d go to the house but he was not really supportive like her daddy either. Cause my mama used to have to beg him to even buy us coats, he went to [DEIDENTIFIED] when they were open to try to get us a jacket and my mama asked him to get a coat, she told him you know, take that junk back and find us a real coat. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> She knows something.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> You know, then it look like, she kind of, she kind of regretted, the woman, we didn’t like the woman either that he was with because my mother wasn’t telling us the truth.
<b>DR:</b> What do you mean?
<b>PT:</b> She wasn’t telling us that they separated. She was trying to tell us they were married and we were looking at our daddy staying in this house with somebody else and like you know.
<b>DR:</b> Confusing.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. And we like and you should have just went on and told us cause we didn’t like this lady but you know now we get along really good.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. 
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I like being around her more than I do my daddy. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you do?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Because she’s nice?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. I don’t know. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, now, tell me about the medicine. 
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know, I can take the medicine at different times, sometimes I can take it at eight or nine, ten o’clock sometimes it depends on I guess, how tired I am. If I’m wide awake I know I don’t need to take it right then cause I’m still wide woke, but then when I do take it, it looks like I wake up about one, two, three o’clock in the morning and can’t go back to sleep. Then I have to wake up at six something so I can make sure my son gets ready for school. Then I’m tired, then I trying to go back to sleep sometimes I don’t have an appointment because lately I’ve been having appointments back to back. 
<b>DR:</b> Medical appointments?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. Doctors appointments back to back.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And half the time I don’t even get a chance to get back to sleep for that few more minutes, most medicine can wear off on one day, went in, I was so drowsy I couldn’t even understand what that lady was saying. 
<b>DR:</b> What time did you take the medicine?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, it’s different times I’m not sure.
<b>DR:</b> On average?
<b>PT:</b> Between eight to ten.
<b>DR:</b> So you’re taking it real late? Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Well, I’m trying to make sure that I sleep until it’s about time for me to get up for my other [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, you take it so late at night. 
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know, it will, certain time I had to take it because you said before you go to bed, so I don’t usually go to bed until about nine or ten.
<b>DR:</b> Well, let’s start taking it about seven o’clock.
<b>PT:</b> Hmm. And if it don’t work then we’ll change it to something?
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. You’re taking it really late at night. Okay what else has been going on?
<b>PT:</b> Nothing much, my little blood daddy is trying to have a relationship with me but I don’t, I don’t know. 
<b>DR:</b> Why don’t you tell me about that?
<b>PT:</b> There’s nothing really to tell about that, he wants to get married and I don’t think he does.
<b>DR:</b> You what?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t think he does, but he said… 
<b>DR:</b> Ready to settle down, how old is he?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE] or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. 
<b>PT:</b> Somewhere around there, you know.
<b>DR:</b> And you’re afraid to trust him, now? Why?
<b>PT:</b> I guess so, I really don’t have a choice to, me and period, really.
<b>DR:</b> You have problems with that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> You’ve been burned too many times.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Is this the only time you’ve raped?
<b>PT:</b> Someone tried to but I kind of stopped it.
<b>DR:</b> When was that?
<b>PT:</b> The one guy tried twice, it was way before I’d say he even tried.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, this would be earlier?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How were you able to stop him?
<b>PT:</b> I didn’t, I guess he was a little more weaker than…
<b>DR:</b> Oh, he wasn’t as big as this guy?
<b>PT:</b> Than him.
<b>DR:</b> You were able to fight him off?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Okay, all right, well any questions you want to ask me?
<b>PT:</b> No, but what kind of medicine can you put me on for like the hallucinations that I’m having or?
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, what we’ll need to do is adjust the medicine a little better to try to get it working a little better, you want to tell me a little bit about the hallucinations, have they gotten any better at all?
<b>PT:</b> No, not really.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you going to tell me about them?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I’m seeing spiders, sometimes I just seeing anything that doesn’t be anything there, it…
<b>DR:</b> When does this occur?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know, might been ever since I’ve been in that apartment.
<b>DR:</b> So, I mean is it during the day? 
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> At night? 
<b>PT:</b> Anytime.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I can just be sitting there watching the TV. I could have swore I seen something crawl in the refrigerator but I couldn’t find nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. You kind of see things in the corner of your eye and then you turn and…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah because I can be laying in the bed and like, like someone walked past or…
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm that’s pretty frightening isn’t it?
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Mind playing tricks on you. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> We’ll try to get that better under control.
<b>PT:</b> Hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Okay dear, well we’ll keep you like we’re doing, and we’ll get you rescheduled too, see if [INAUDIBLE] medicine [INAUDIBLE]. All right, any other questions?
<b>PT:</b> No. What about for the depression?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, we’ll that’s what I’m saying, we’ll try to get the medicine adjusted to work a little better. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> But the only thing I’m on is the… 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm, that’s what I’m saying. We want to take them one at a time.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
