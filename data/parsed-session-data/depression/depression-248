BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	It's recording, set it here, and ignore it.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Right, right exactly.  No, the, the beauty of this is you could otherwise say whatever you need to.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's not a problem.
<b>DR:</b>	More importantly, how are you?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm okay.  I'm fine.  Coming, coming into the winter stuff, I still haven't gotten one of those lights like we talked about, because my husband thinks it's stupid.  We're doing some battling type thing.  We're, we're at that weird 21 year in the marriage thing and he wants to go off and build motorcycles, which is fine, and, I don't know, we're just going through some stuff.  It, it comes and goes in marriage, we'll get through it, it's fine.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I want to strangle him.  I'm sure he wants to strangle me, so we're fine.  But other than that we're good friends.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	You guys are doing things together, I mean, independent [INAUDIBLE] about you?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, we really don't do a lot together, no.  Um, 1, financially 2, honestly, we have completely different interests right now.  Um, like I said, he's been on this, he's going through like some mid life crisis type thing.  He's, um, he went and got a tattoo, which is fine, I don't care.  He's wanted a tattoo for years.  He got it on his leg.  It's of the inner gears of a motor of a motorcycle.  It's cool, that's great.  I think now that he got it he's like why did the hell did I spend the money on that, quite honestly.  But it looks neat.  He's wanted one for years, why not?  I don't care.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But literally, he goes to work, and he has a very, we work in the same building, but for different companies.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	He has a very stressful job that he absolutely despises as well.  He will not even go look for anything else.  I found him a job he probably could have had with the state that would've been more money, probably good benefits, probably better hours.  Um, he wouldn't even go in to look into it.  Part of it is, well he's [AGE], he's 6 years older than I am.  Um, he's never, I think I told you, uh, back in April they found out he had high blood pressure and, well they said diabetes.  He needed to come in for A1c.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And 5 years before that he had been told he had diabetes in the ER.  He's never followed up on that.  If I even mention it I'm nagging, get off his back, it's fucking life.  He doesn't realize, yeah, it affects the people who love you too.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, so there will be a big blowup about that.  I'm just trying to make it either really before the holidays or after.  Trying to, you know, I hate ruining the holidays with a big, major blowup, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	He's going through, I think he is like okay, I'm [AGE], I've always wanted to do this kind of stuff.  The kids are getting older now.  I want to go do this.
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	I don't care if he builds motorcycles on the side as long as there's for the money for it and he's not taking money away from things we need or whatever, but I also cannot pretend to be interested in it.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	No interest at all.  Oh, for 2 years he's been trying, we should go to [DEIDENTIFIED].  I would not mind going to [DEIDENTIFIED].  He went to [DEIDENTIFIED].  He wants us to, well 1, he wants me to learn how to ride a motorcycle.  No desire.  To me they're death traps.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	That's how I was raised.  I can ride on the back of one with him.
<b>DR:</b>	That's what you say, but you ride with him.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I'm scared to death doing so even though I trust him implicitly, I do it.  Um, thank god his broke down like a year ago and we haven't like gotten it fixed so I haven't had to do it for a while.  Didn't have to do it this year at all.  But literally, it scares me to death.  I was just raised they are death traps period, no matter what, even sitting still, if you're sitting on one it's a death trap, you will die.  That's what my mom taught me and it stuck.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I understand that.
<b>PT:</b>	And I, I can't, I can't fake being interested in it.  I mean, he'll talk, he's doing a lot of, um, actually building different parts and things, which he just loves to do, and that's great, that's fantastic.  You know, I think the stuff he turns out, I mean, I definitely comment on it, "God, that's gorgeous."  How did he do that, but, but I don't want to sit out there in the garage with him while he's doing it.  I'm sorry, I have 0 interest.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And right now, well I figured out a couple things, I have no friends.  [LAUGHING]  I have my work friends, but we don't like do things, you know.  I have no friends.  That's been my own fault.  I didn't follow through with friendships.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I've thrown a lot into either work or the kids.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Now the kids are getting older, they, in some ways they need me even more, in other ways they don't need me at all.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So I need to get a life.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just figuring out how to do that, you know.  It's like okay what do I want to do?  Like I was talking to some guy I met at a convenience store about, he brought up the economy and how with Obama's President, we all got to hope we have jobs next year, and we all better go buy guns because we won't be able to, which I hate guns anyway.  So I'm happy with that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	That would be okay.
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	And he goes, "Well, you know, what you, if," he's saying, "there's job out there."  I said, "Well, I've looked and there really isn't squat—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Unless I go back to school.  "Well go back to school."  Tell me how I'm supposed to afford that.  I, I can't afford that.  You know, I keep thinking about picking up a second job because we've got a daughter going to college next year.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Senior year expenses, I'm sorry, as minimal as you try to go they rack up—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Plus this is our son's sophomore year, and I need to ask you some questions about him by the way.  Um, so it's class ring, senior pictures, announcements, you know, preparing for college, college applications.  Thank god she's been accepted at 2 places—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So she knows where she's going.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's like that's what I've been doing.  And I don't, I can't scrape up the money to go back to school.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I cannot do it.  Plus, quite honestly, I don't have the energy to.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	My, my job was sitting on my butt all day behind a computer screen, and probably not having, knowing that I'm not going home to really anything that I want to go home to, we're having problems with our son, because my husband's off doing, not really doing his own thing, but he's either on the computer, reading Chopper Web or he's out in the garage doing chopper things, which I have no interest in.  You can't ask him a question when he's reading Chopper Web.  You cannot have a discussion.  If someone were to cut their arm off it would be like, "I'll be done with this thread in a minute."
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And that's just when he's involved in something he's totally, completely—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	He will master it and then he will totally have a different direction and go.  But I get off work, but I've been doing better, I can actually make it to almost 7:00 now before I fall asleep on the couch for 2 hours.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	And, and then do you sleep at night?
<b>PT:</b>	I sleep fine at night.  The thing is it's like even, I, for, well, we've had like some illness junk going on.  Um, you know, the head type stuff really bad.  Um, like really bad, for 3 weeks.  Plus I think I have fall allergies, which I've never had before, because even the sneezing and like 1 day I feel fine and the next day all of a sudden I'm sneezing and it, not itching, but runny eyes, stuff that shouldn't last this long.  But that whipped me totally.  So there are times and, understand, my son had it the same time, understandably.  It's like okay, I'm going to bed at 7:00 tonight.  I could very easily sleep through until 10:00 the next morning, get up for 6 hours and be tired again.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Literally be tired again.  But some of it I know is sitting on my butt all day at work even though every break we get I get outside.  I don't care if it's pouring rain, I walk around outside.  I do jumping jacks.  I do stretches whatever.  But I don't seem to have a lot of energy, but I think part of that is I don't really have anything to look forward to doing that I'm interested in doing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I have a house that I could clean.  I did that for years.  I have no desire to do that.
<b>DR:</b>	When you wakeup in the morning do you feel refreshed?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't feel tired.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I just, I get up in the morning, I feel like definitely that I've slept, it's just, you know, I hate my job, so it's like do I feel okay or am I sick?  Am I lucky enough to feel [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But, no, I don't, I don't, I thought, you know, maybe I have sleep apnea or something like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But I don't.  I do snore.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Really bad.  But, um, like I had my husband listen and the kids listen and stuff, he's like, "No, you don't gasp for breath, you don't [INAUDIBLE]."
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but are you, could you, could you if you were given the opportunity anytime of the day to sleep?  Could you fall asleep?
<b>PT:</b>	At anytime, no.  But like during work, well if I'm sitting watching TV at all then depending on the show—
<b>DR:</b>	Right, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I can get tired.  Plus we have a, we're trying to watch like electrical costs and stuff, so like we keep the lights low.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Obviously, huh, yeah.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].  That's going to do it.  Um, and at work it, it, it's a lot of the, we have monitors no bigger than that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Which is really bad for full time data entry, and after a while your eyes get so tired.  Like if you're doing the exact same thing over and over and over again, which a lot of our work is.  The other day I was sitting there, I was going to stay until 5:00, because I had, um, been late 2 days, because I had to take our son to school.  And I caught myself falling asleep at 4:30, so it's like okay time to go home.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you, you know, like driving a car can you start to fall asleep or—
<b>PT:</b>	Only if [INAUDIBLE].  I've had that problem for, I cannot drive interstate.  I've had that problem for my entire life.  So I don't know.  I mean, that bothers me, and I keep thinking could I have something wrong?  Should I go, I mean, I had a physical.  Everything in my physical is fine.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean, I guess I would tell you that, that, that I, I do wonder about having you have a, an evaluation, at least an intake for apnea.
<b>PT:</b>	Because, and then I, because I'm not, I will not wear a CPAP, I will not wear it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I guarantee no, Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b>	What if it would make a difference in terms of say [INAUDIBLE] you need to lose some weight and exercise.
<b>PT:</b>	I know I need to lose weight.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I know you know that.  And I, I know lots of people that—
<b>PT:</b>	I had to stand on the—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Scale 2 weeks ago when I had an ear infection and I—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I, I didn't even put my purse down.  I was like I know I've gained weight screw it.
<b>DR:</b>	The CPAP machines can be more tolerable than people think they are.
<b>PT:</b>	Ugly is [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I wouldn't use it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I mean, I understand.  You're right, I mean, I understand if the, really the reality is is even if even we confirm it—
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, the reality, I would not, I would not use it.
<b>DR:</b>	What people need to know though about untreated apnea is if they have it—
<b>PT:</b>	Very dangerous.
<b>DR:</b>	Risk for strokes and heart attacks in the middle of the night are, are really—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean, how do they test you?  Can you be tested at home or do you have to go to some sleep lab thing or?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's an overnight at a sleep lab.
<b>PT:</b>	Remember, I was trying to get out of work.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Not out of sleeping in my comfortable—
<b>DR:</b>	Understand, right.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I have a sleep number bed and I'm [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	What, you know, what I would tell you is it's, it's kind of a, uh, it's a, it's a 3 step process really.  It's a matter of going and seeing the, the sleep clinician and having them do kind of a probably 30 to 45 minute kind of review, go through your history, ask you lots of questions related to sleep.  Lots of places actually send you a pretty extensive questionnaire that, lots of yes, no things, but to fill out so that they've got a lot of information—
<b>PT:</b>	When you're walking in the door.
<b>DR:</b>	Then from there they, they just, they sit down and talk to you, they go through your history and they tell you, hey look, yeah, I think you're exhibiting enough risk factors that I think we do need to do a sleep study, because people can also have other conditions other than apneas and they can get data from that.  And you're right, I mean, classically sometimes people do have those funny breathing patterns in the night, but that's really, that doesn't clear you to say you don't have sleep apnea.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	They will get, you know, it's nothing invasive.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But they look at oxygen levels, they look at brain matter activity.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's just a monitor type stuff, I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly, yeah.  And, um, you know, but, but they do, if they think you need it they'll schedule you for that overnight.  Then they get kind of reams of data out of that, and then they have to go back and kind of go through and analyze that data, and they schedule you back for another visit to say hey look, here's, here's the results.  Um—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, if it's something that you think is worth checking into, well I will not wear a CPAP most likely ever, even if I needed it unless I was like 60 or something.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, and the other thing they could tell you, quite honestly, that they can quantify, is they can say, look this is a little bit of mild apnea and, you know what, we don't necessarily think you need it.  And if you lost 10 pounds that might make a difference, which may give you that 1 more boost of motivation.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	At the same time, if they tell you, you know what, this is severe and profound apnea and you're de saturating a lot through the night.  You may go, you know what, okay, look I'm still not happy about this, but I might be willing to try it show me what you got.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's true.
<b>DR:</b>	And I guess the only thing I would tell you would be the other thing that we see a lot in mental health is we see people either struggling a lot with residual symptoms of apnea or we go to the ends of the earth to try to treat it with the right medication.  To treat a depression, and the reality is is it's really an apnea.
<b>PT:</b>	It's not depression, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and so I guess my feeling is is that it, you know, it'd be covered under your insurance plan, the initial visit is just a sense, I mean even at that initial visit they can tell you how strongly they think you need a sleep study or not.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean, if they say you know, we could do one of these, but you're on the fence, I understand, your answer maybe you know what, if that's all the more you think I need it—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't know that I'd be likely to proceed.  But I guess, uh, the person we've been referring to most recently has been [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Um, pulmonary guy in town, just kind of hit that point in his life where he didn't want to be doing middle of the night Intensive Care Unit stuff.  And so he focused—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	So he's, he's switched his focus over to sleep.  He's over in [DEIDENTIFIED] over by that [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, right off of [DEIDENTIFIED].  The thing we like, I, I like all the [DEIDENTIFIED] sleep doctors, it's just that—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It, it's a 3 month process to get you there, get you study, and get result if you need it.  Whereas for the most part, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Can do these things in a couple of weeks.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And, and in my mind it's, it's otherwise he's a good guy that's good testing.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, well, I mean, I don't want to die, I, I do try to watch my health.  I'm not perfect at it.  So if it's something that you think we should consider I'd, I'd rather do that.  I don't want to make, I don't feel like we need to up any meds.  For a while I did notice, when we made that increase, actually it made me like a little hyper for a while.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And it made me like a little tired for a while, but that was like a matter of weeks.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you tolerating it okay at this point?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Definitely fine.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um—
<b>PT:</b>	And that seems to be, it's actually, up until, for some reason this week I've been more anxious than I have been like the past, since we made the change.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But within about a week, honestly, it's been fantastic.  Night and day difference.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Just this past week I been feeling more anxious, but I, I don't, well there's a couple things going on, might be, that might be causing it, but I don't know.  I'm not the expert yet.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, as you, and it, it doesn't, I mean—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	It doesn't sound like frustration of lows or at any point life isn't worth living kind of emotions or feelings at this point?
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, no that's [DEIDENTIFIED] all those guys you hear about that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, isn't that awful, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, they need to find out what's going on with those kids.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, and, and, you know, and I realize it's at a different level and it's maybe a little harder, hard, little harder to be empathetic with the population, but even the [DEIDENTIFIED] professors.
<b>PT:</b>	Scares the hell out of me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, that's, that's a, that's a, the kids in that town are, that go to that school, they're crying for help that, I don't know, they, they need to be getting their, a lot of mental health professionals finding out what's going on.  Just after having 1 suicide in our family.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, question.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Finally after years and year and year, uh, I believe my son has some sort of a learning disability.  And my husband's saying, "They're going to say he's got ADD, and ADD's crap and they're not putting him on medication, and he's just lazy," and all this crap.  I believe we need to have him assessed for a learning disability, and I have counselors and teachers agreeing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, they said, "Well, contact your family doctor and see what he says.  Contact your family doctor."  And he goes, "I don't know what the school's saying."  So I thought I would ask you.  Um, a Sylvan thing like that, we can't afford that.  I just need an assessment or evaluation—
<b>DR:</b>	It should be, it should be covered.  You're right, Sylvan wouldn't be, probably not.  But, but—
<b>PT:</b>	Isn't it a, kind of, I mean it's neurological—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's a health condition, right exactly.  And I think that's the difference is Sylvan, as much as they can help kids—
<b>PT:</b>	Right, they can't do an evaluation.
<b>DR:</b>	You're right, exactly.  They are kind of an educational resource group.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And so your, you know, your insurance plan, you know, will look at that and say, "Well, that's not really a direct, you know, that's not really direct healthcare," even though it can be a benefit.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], uh, is a therapist here in town, he's not, his office is not too far form here.  He's, um—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, right around the [DEIDENTIFIED] area here.  And I'm sorry I don't have his phone number, but I know he's in the book.
<b>PT:</b>	I can, I can find it.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, he is, he specifically is trained in education.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But he's a therapist, and he's actually who we send our, or I send a lot of our people—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	To him specifically—
<b>PT:</b>	I knew you [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Related to those questions of like attention, learning, and things like that.
<b>PT:</b>	Well that's, we need to know.  It's like, okay, does he have a learning disability?  If so, god help us for not getting help earlier.  We need to do something about it.  He's a sophomore, he's [AGE].  He's struggling very badly in certain, he's very, very bright—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But he just can't hold a thought long enough there to get there.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And he loses homework before he even gets out of the classroom and everything else.  And it's not, maybe he is just unmotivated and, so we need to know which it is.
<b>DR:</b>	I, and, and like I said, and I agree with you.  And, you know, look I understand too, you know, I would have no enthusiasm for having my kid have an illness.  Um, but like you said, the reality is, is if you're seeing those patterns or those things there's a high likelihood—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That there, there is something diagnostic going on.
<b>PT:</b>	Well and the thing, it's like if it's just him being lazy and stuff my impression in, on behavior and stuff is there generally is a payoff for someone.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, so what is his payoff for being in trouble with his teachers all the time, in trouble when he's home all the time, um, not able to go biking because he doesn't have his work done, not being able to go places, not being able, I mean, I don't see where there's a payoff.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you, um—
<b>PT:</b>	So we don't normally continue that behavior without some sort of a payoff.
<b>DR:</b>	The other thing that I always I think is, have you, um, have you asked his teachers at all what they think about—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, and I, when I talked to his math teacher at this conference, who [NAME OTHER] absolutely despises, so it was, yeah, I never take my kid's words for everything 100%, but I found him to be a very boring teacher, but very concerned about [NAME OTHER] and a lot of the kids.  And he said, yeah, he goes, "Honestly," he goes, "[NAME OTHER] biggest problem is he can't hold a thought long enough to get the work done."  And honestly, he gets math like 0, a 0.  He will need additional help.  But other teachers it's the same thing it's like, and his pattern there's always been he doesn't turn in the work, maybe he's not even doing the work.  Well then, of course, come test time you don't know it.  But another thing, physical stuff he's in, um, they have him in a service learning class, which is going out and doing community service, absolutely loves it, always has, always will, wishes whole schedule is that.  And even CAD, which he's very interested in construction.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And he loves art and, the kind of art really and all the mechanical stuff, he does really well in that.  And art he does fantastic.  PE fantastic, anything physical.  It's when you ask him to sit down—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And read or—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  The only thought I have, [PATIENT NAME], is just, is that, and it sounds like some of what you've done, is the teachers, it's such a sensitive issue that lots of times teachers can't make the comments so directly about things.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	But I think sometimes a parent that says, Hey look, I have this interest in knowing—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What do you think about this—
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Even though I know—
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, yes I did at conferences.
<b>DR:</b>	That it's a sensitive issue.  Yeah, it's good.
<b>PT:</b>	And I've been—
<b>DR:</b>	Because that's, I think sometimes you can allow them the freedom to, to make—
<b>PT:</b>	In, in middle school when I started bringing it up, um, a lot of people, well, you know, we don't want to label him.  And I said, "Quite frankly, I don't care if he's labeled or not."  I'm labeled.  I have an anxiety disorder.  I have depression.  I don't care about a label.  I care about my kid being able to function the rest of his life.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.  Well, like I say, you might—
<b>PT:</b>	And feel good about himself.
<b>DR:</b>	Be able to get, teachers, teachers are in a classroom, they've got—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, they, they've got 28 kids there—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And if your child is an [INAUDIBLE] in certain areas there's some [INAUDIBLE] to understanding that.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, they, they can't even see you, yeah, and they can generally—
<b>DR:</b>	Right, and I understand you're not asking them to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	That's what I asked him, I said, I said, "I just, I need your input, what are you seeing going on in class?"  And it's always the same stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you still on Chantix?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, because I know that we started it, uh, uh, about July, so it would be time to be off of it.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you smoking?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I'll be honest.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I blowed it.
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	I just, I have this, honestly, I will be quite honest, part of the reason that I'm having a problem quitting smoking is because I'm very angry that my husband won't follow through with his health issues, so it's like—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Screw it, then I'm not going to quit.
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	And no matter how bad I want to for me and for my kids that is always going on in the back of my mind.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I understand.  That's hard.
<b>PT:</b>	It's so, it's so childish.
<b>DR:</b>	That's hard.  Well, again, like you say—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] any, any person.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	Um—
<b>PT:</b>	So this is—
<b>DR:</b>	That is, that's the—
<b>PT:</b>	For the name of the light.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  What, what I asked them to do though is put your name, because I don't know where we're at, is why don't we have you checkout, we've got a light, and people can check it out for a week or 2 and give it a try.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Why don't we have you do that.  And, you know, even if we don't have it available today they'll put you on the list and they'll call you when it comes in.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And at the same time, I did check this week, the best deal I can find, and I, and I know it's expensive—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	It's still, right, and I, and I pulled—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	It up, I think it's, it's about $140, so it's expensive.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, you know, if it's going to get me through the winter without—
<b>DR:</b>	But, what I would suggest though is try, try ours—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And let's get you the sleep evaluation before you invest in one.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  And then did you write that down here, yeah, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And this is for, um, my son, [NAME OTHER] to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Right, exactly right.  That's [NAME OTHER] name.  But I want to see you back in 2 months.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	All right?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] I was hoping it'd be around Christmas so I can give you my present in person.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I assume we're doing the same thing we did last year.
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING] I was hoping we'd do a little more.
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	Free sessions for a year.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, but well see that's in the drawing so maybe.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's just like that $25,000 scholarship my daughter's going to get.
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	But I entered for a $25,000 scholarship mom.
<b>DR:</b>	If there's any hang up with [NAME OTHER] I, I'll get you some other names.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But that's my, that would be my [INAUDIBLE] one.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, great.
<b>DR:</b>	And call me then.
<b>PT:</b>	I will.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] all right, take care of yourself, [PATIENT NAME] and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I will.  So you're not going to give me a note for work?
<b>DR:</b>	Oh you need one?
<b>PT:</b>	Then I don't have to go back, but she needs to be paid.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  I think you're probably the person [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	You're welcome.  Good to see you, [PATIENT NAME].
