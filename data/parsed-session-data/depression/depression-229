BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	How are you doing?
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, um, I'm still, I had a hard time and, um, I was having a series of, um, really bad dreams, um, [INAUDIBLE] violent, so I was a little bit scared, and I thought oh my God, these thoughts are coming back.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah?  What seemed to set that off?  Well, did they come back?
<b>PT:</b>	I was sad for a couple of days.
<b>DR:</b>	A couple of days.  Well, listen—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] but I'm still like having trouble sleeping.
<b>DR:</b>	You are?  Well, you may be relapsing a touch.  Let's, uh, let's go through it.  I saw you on [DATE].
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Mood was okay, but you had lots of, um, anxiety from the change of career and those issues.  You weren't especially sad or irritable.  Your appetite was good.  You were exercising.  Your energy was decent.  You were sleeping well.  Your work was going well.  You're not suicidal, not hopeless or helpless, getting along with people and, um, you thought you, you maintained your remission on the Zoloft to Wellbutrin cocktail, correct?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, so in these three months, inch me along.  What has happened?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, so we're talking May—
<b>DR:</b>	March, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Right?
<b>DR:</b>	April.  I mean I saw you March.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, so April, May and June.
<b>DR:</b>	And now, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, well the judge [INAUDIBLE] for [DEIDENTIFIED] to become—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	He had a big position there.  At the last minute, he changed his mind.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and—
<b>DR:</b>	And what, what was the plan for you though [INAUDIBLE]—
<b>PT:</b>	I was going to go work for another judge.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  So in a way, I felt very sad like around the time that he was leaving, but then I started getting excited that I would [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Like a new challenge.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  And I was going to be doing less work—
<b>DR:</b>	When did he change his mind?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I think sometime in April.
<b>DR:</b>	And what was the thinking around his changing his mind?
<b>PT:</b>	He just thought it wasn't the right job for him.
<b>DR:</b>	Hmm.
<b>PT:</b>	So, he called me up 7:30 in the morning and said I'm not going.  I'm not doing this and I thought he was kidding because there was a big farewell party for him and everything and he wasn't kidding.  So, it was a little anticlimactic because I felt like I was very pained that he was leaving, you know.  I had been with him for a really long time, and then I got used to the idea.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And then—
<b>DR:</b>	And the new judge was a good one, I mean someone you wanted to work with?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  Yeah, smart, um, normal.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	And your judge has helped you get that position?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.  Um, I went to talk to this administrative judge and she was ready to place me in the [DEIDENTIFIED], um, doing civil work, which I wasn't interested in.  She knew nothing about me.  She didn't know where I lived or anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And she was just ready to ship me out.  So I came back to the office and I started like crying and sobbing and losing it.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, the judge walked in and he saw me having that meltdown, so he went to talk to her, and, um, all of a sudden, I wasn't going to the [DEIDENTIFIED], so I was happy.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  So he, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, he's got some pull when he wants it?
<b>PT:</b>	When he wants it.
<b>DR:</b>	So he went to bat for you.  So, that—
<b>PT:</b>	That was good.
<b>DR:</b>	That was good, right, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that was very good.
<b>DR:</b>	He never—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Done much before.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	So.
<b>PT:</b>	So then the other piece is I put in my application to be a judge.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, he made calls on my behalf.  So I was really surprised that he really—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Well especially if he wasn't an [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	That's what it is, right.  All of a sudden.  If it doesn't hurt him—
<b>PT:</b>	Right [INAUDIBLE].  Right.  So, um—
<b>DR:</b>	But he can't undo the calls now that he's back.  So, is your application still in?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It is.  So—
<b>PT:</b>	And, and, and there's a part of me that, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Now, did he call, he made informal calls, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Not formal letters?
<b>PT:</b>	Right, right.  You can't do that.
<b>DR:</b>	So the informal calls though, uh, he can send the message back that you know what, I, I'd rather she stay with me.  You had him do that—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, no.  Yeah, he knows I'm really ready to go.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	So I don't think, no, I don't think he'll do that, and I really do want to go.  It feels very anticlimactic.  It was like I was starting to get excited about doing something new.
<b>DR:</b>	Excited to get rid of him, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, to try something new.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, okay.  Over these months though, in general, what, what's your mood been like?
<b>PT:</b>	It kind of goes up and down.  May was Mother's Day, so, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	That was a little rough.  Um, uh, and then I talked to my brother [NAME OTHER] and I think that's what kind of set it off, um, because he told me one of my brothers is going to take [NAME OTHER].  He's moving to New Jersey.  Um, you know, I don't have his phone number.  I won't be able to see, you know, my brother again.  So, that kind of bummed me out, and that's when I started having the dreams.
<b>DR:</b>	When was this, in May?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, if I go back, it must have been the third week in May.
<b>DR:</b>	And, uh, would you wake up every night?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Were they nightmares?  Were they like—
<b>PT:</b>	One, one, one was, um, I was in the projects.  I was looking out the window and I had my hands like this, and I felt like I wanted to fall out the window, but then I never did, but I had a sensation that I was going to go out the window.  And there was another dream that my brother, my oldest brother, was choking me, like trying to kill me.  And then I had another dream the following night that this guy I went out with, he was beating me up.  So, and I was like running and trying to escape.
<b>DR:</b>	So most, most times people are hurting you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You aren't hurting anyone else?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	And they were, uh, and you talked to [NAME OTHER] about it to try and get some—
<b>PT:</b>	You know, she's, she's away.  She's going to be away until, for a whole month until, um—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] to take vacation.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, what's your, what's your interpretation?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know if it's the residual effects, if I'm kind of shedding, you know, something opened up in me and I'm going, re—experiencing some trauma.  Um, I think that could be it.  Uh, having a conversation with my brother—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] sense of loss or—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, just a sense of how crazy my family is.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it, it feels traumatic to me.  You know, it's, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Kind of like with people with PTSD get.  You know, they, they re—experience, uh, although it sounds like it's nothing very specific.  It's more a general sense of being [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  Like my brother did used to hit me, you know, and I did get beat, you know.  So, there's some truth to it.
<b>DR:</b>	Which brother hit you?
<b>PT:</b>	My oldest brother, [NAME OTHER], is schizophrenic.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah?  Well, you know, most superficial reading I bet would be kind of recharging that up.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	That terror that you experienced.
<b>PT:</b>	But it could also be I'm angry at, uh, my brother [NAME OTHER] for acquiescing to my—
<b>DR:</b>	But your anger would be you, you hurting someone else.  Here, you're the recipient—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Of all the aggression.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	I bet you probably are angry.
<b>PT:</b>	I am.
<b>DR:</b>	But, you know, that's not a conflicted emotion, so you don't need to dream it, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  That makes sense.
<b>DR:</b>	Um—
<b>PT:</b>	So, you know, so I was getting up at night and I was having a hard time falling asleep, but, so I decided, my asthma doctor told me that I needed to see what was going on with me at night because I've been having trouble sleeping.  So she referred to me the Sleep Disorder Clinic.  So I'm going to go deal with that, you know, do the study, see what happens.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you tired during the day?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Today I was exhausted.
<b>DR:</b>	And what is your sleep like?
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	How long does it take to fall asleep?
<b>PT:</b>	It takes a while.  I usually read something before I go to sleep and that helps me—
<b>DR:</b>	It takes hours?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah sometimes it could take about an hour and a half.
<b>DR:</b>	And once you get to sleep, do you sleep straight through or you're up and down?
<b>PT:</b>	I wake up in the middle of the night.  Sometimes I have to go to the bathroom.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you stay up?  Do you stay awake?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, for a little bit, yeah.  It depends if I, uh, get up and I can't go back to sleep, you know, I'll watch TV for a little bit and I go back to bed.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you sad much of the time now?
<b>PT:</b>	No, but, but I've been noticing that more.
<b>DR:</b>	You seem sadder to me.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Than you used to be.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, you're sad a decent part of the time?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think that's correct, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And, uh, besides what we've talked about, anything else that's driving the sadness?
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	We've got the Mother's Day issue, your brother issues, the judge issues.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I kind of feel frustrated in terms of professionally, that I'd like to do something else.  I, I get a great deal of satisfaction from my work, but lately I've been feeling like I can do more.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	So, um, I think there's some of that, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It's not enough.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, the thing is too with like my brother [NAME OTHER] I feel like I have to call him.  I never get phone calls from them, you know.  So, um, yesterday I tried calling my brother [NAME OTHER], and, uh, he, he, uh, changed his phone number.  So, you know, because I thought let me just talk to him and, you know, say to him what are you doing, you know, [INAUDIBLE] this horrible tradition of being so dysfunctional, but, but, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Couldn't reach him.
<b>PT:</b>	Couldn't reach him, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Pretty dysfunctional.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  I mean you can hope for normal relationships, but I—
<b>PT:</b>	He's going to have to—
<b>DR:</b>	He's going to have to, you know, I wish I, you know, there's always hope, but—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Don't hold your breath.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  Right.  I mean it is what it is, but, you know, I still keep banging my head off the wall.
<b>DR:</b>	But and you're still experiencing the loss.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  You need to get that on tape.
<b>DR:</b>	It's like a knife in your heart where it's—
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	It's like a hole that just won't, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	Fill up.
<b>DR:</b>	Won't fill up.  It's a shame.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It's a shame you can't just, you know, move it here.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, you know, I tell myself [INAUDIBLE], um, uh, it's the past.  Live in the present.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	You [INAUDIBLE] but there's little things that keep coming back, you know.  I think about you when you say oh, it's that [INAUDIBLE], you know, that [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Some of it's driven by anxiety.  Like do you find you're anxious at home?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	There's a lot of anxiety juice in the brain, you know your brain just finds these things.
<b>PT:</b>	Without looking, hunting and gathering.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, you know, like a magnet, or you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Just looking for things that it can eat up like it, like a Pac Man almost, like it can churn oil, cause the processes you bring it wants to churn.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I want to still it, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	There are techniques people use that, you know, OCD type of things.
<b>PT:</b>	Like meditation.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well meditation, you know, people with OCD get a thought, you know, like a contamination [INAUDIBLE] right, like I touch the doorknob, I feel like I got germs on my hands.  So the thought gets stuck and I have to go wash my hands to reduce anxiety, and then when I come back, the thought's still there.  I can't let go of the thought and so fifty times, I'm washing hands, and so, what people with OCD have to do is there's a process where first you have to recognize that you're in one of those loops, that you're in it, but once you realize you're in it, then there are very specific techniques for breaking out of it, and you know, I don't know if it has relevance to what you're talking about, but if you can see these things as kind of dysfunctional loops that you get into, then you can move to the next step of breaking, breaking out of the [INAUDIBLE].  You know—
<b>PT:</b>	Can I read about this?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, well you'd have to adapt the techniques they use for OCD—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	To you, but do you suspect you do get into these loops like, you know, you think about things you just can't let go of?
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and you know, they have visual, visualization and counting backwards and you know, they have very specific ways of breaking—
<b>PT:</b>	Breaking.
<b>DR:</b>	Breaking its hold on you especially when it's driven by anxiety, especially when it's, you know, an OCD like negative pattern.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, so there's a book, I'll write it out for you.  It's called Brain Lock by, uh Schwartz.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Good stuff, you know, it really goes through—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	Techniques you used to do.  You can play around online and find, but and people with OCD, it turns out that it's better to do this stuff than to take medication.  So, you know, medicine and Prozac and whatever works, this works better.  It works better to learn, you know, techniques will manage your anxiety.  Um, do you have any suicidal thinking?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you feel hopeless or helpless?
<b>PT:</b>	I feel hopeless about some things, you know, like the family, but, um, I don't feel hopeless about my, my job or finding something that's going to satisfy me.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you forward looking?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I'm studying for, um, you know, when I get interviewed by the committee.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	They ask you lots of questions?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and—
<b>DR:</b>	To see that you know the law well?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, and I want to do family law, so I'm going to study family law.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, when is the interview?
<b>PT:</b>	Who knows, when there's an opening.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, so they keep your file—
<b>PT:</b>	For a year.
<b>DR:</b>	Active, and they call you in where there's, are you able to get pleasure?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What do you enjoy, what kind of things?
<b>PT:</b>	I like reading.  I go outside and garden.  That gives me a lot of joy.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	In [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Uh, [INAUDIBLE] I like that.
<b>DR:</b>	The [INAUDIBLE] okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Um, let's see.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's enough.  That's plenty.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That's plenty, and uh, your concentration's okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, this is tough because you're, you know, you're on a decent cocktail, right?  You know this is a nice—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And you've got real symptoms now kind of breaking through with depression.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, some of this is, you know, kind of legitimate loss and working through and kind of churning through losses, and I'm not crazy about raising meds or adding new medications [INAUDIBLE].  Have we ever been on 450 of, uh, Wellbutrin?
<b>PT:</b>	At the beginning, I think I was on that.
<b>DR:</b>	So was that too activating for you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's right, you were on—
<b>PT:</b>	I broke out in a rash or something.  Yeah, I had a reaction to the meds.
<b>DR:</b>	And there was an issue last time with whether it was brands or generic.
<b>PT:</b>	It's clear.  They're giving my brand.
<b>DR:</b>	The brand.  Has it made a difference?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You really feel—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That the generic just wasn't—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Cutting it.
<b>PT:</b>	My stomach getting upset.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, good.  Pfizer came out with a generic, Pfizer, you know, Pfizer makes Zoloft.  They came out with their own generic.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	All right, well—
<b>PT:</b>	Because a lot of their patents probably expired.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Right?
<b>DR:</b>	Well no, it's generic, so, but it's the [INAUDIBLE] some of the generic—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Generic mark.
<b>PT:</b>	Mark, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You want to start a third medicine?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, no.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b>	Can we, can we just keep me in a holding pattern?
<b>DR:</b>	We can.  I don't want you depressed though.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, the other option and well I can do this now.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But if, if we don't, if this doesn't clear, we could trade Zoloft for something else.
<b>PT:</b>	Like what?
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, there are a few others.  There's like, uh, Cymbalta, Effexor, you know.  I mean there are things that you have not been on.  You've been on Zoloft the whole way, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	For years.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So—
<b>PT:</b>	What's the difference between, um, those medications and Zoloft?
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, there's a class of medicine called SSRI, serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor, and they're all similar in that they raise serotonin levels and those are Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Lexapro, Celexa, and we find that some people react better to one than another, but they're all kind of the same in that they raise serotonin.
<b>PT:</b>	Serotonin.
<b>DR:</b>	And so kind of the easiest switch would be to one of the other ones of those.  Have you ever been on Prozac?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, [INAUDIBLE] Zoloft, the Prozac or the Lexapro, anything.  Then there's this other group of medicines or a few medicines that raise serotonin and have a norenephrine kick, you know.  It, it raises both neurotransmitters, and that's often good, it's good in other ways for different types of depressions.  It probably packs a bit of a bigger punch and so if I were to switch you, I'd probably go to what's called an SNRI, serotonin norenephrine uptake inhibitor.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And that would be either Effexor, Pristiq, which is a, a variant of Effexor, it's Effexor light, or Cymbalta, which you've probably seen commercials for it.  Then there are some of the older medications, tricylic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors, but I'm not crazy about going to those yet just because the side effect profile is not good, and, you know, you were, you've been so well for so long that I don't think it'll take much to get you back there, and, in fact, now I think you'll get back there without us doing much.  I agree with you, holding pattern is probably the way to go just—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And, you know, and psychotherapy, I mean—
<b>PT:</b>	I miss [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean that would probably help you kind of organize this stuff in a way that doesn't let you spin it in these depressive ways.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Cry much?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	How much?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, [INAUDIBLE] I cry.
<b>DR:</b>	Every day?
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, not that much.
<b>DR:</b>	Does anyone else think you're pretty depressed these days?
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] says she's noticing that, um, I seem to be [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	You're drifting down?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and get quiet.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and it's been at least a month or two?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, can we agree that you come back in about two months.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And we'll agree that if things are really in the same place, we got to do something.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Can I, I'll, I'll call you in a month's time.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Just to let you know what's up.
<b>DR:</b>	That's even better, and even, you know, we may even make a change on the phone.  We, we do go higher on Zoloft than 200 and it may be that your liver just got really good at chewing it up, and the, and the same Zoloft dose gives you a lower blood level, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe, and we could go higher, but 200 is, is, uh, quite a big dose and so if you're breaking through 200, my inclination is more towards switching.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, all right.  So—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] the punch, I like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, so this is kind of a, call this a partial relapse.
<b>PT:</b>	It sounds good.
<b>DR:</b>	And we're going to watch, watchful waiting for now, watch for now, but consider switch.  You need prescriptions?
<b>PT:</b>	I do, and, uh, I was wondering if I could get a prescription for Optivan because—
<b>DR:</b>	Ativan, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Ativan, I don't have.  How was your trip?  The last time you were going away.
<b>DR:</b>	It was good.
<b>PT:</b>	It was good?
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  What's happening over there?
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  It's always something.
<b>PT:</b>	Iran is pretty [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	So I'm writing for Zoloft 200.  Do you need the Zoloft?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And brand, you need the brand, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  I didn't know the guy who was the head, the president of Iran, I didn't know he was an engineer.
<b>DR:</b>	Is he?  I didn't know that.  He's a nut.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  He has a doctorate.
<b>DR:</b>	Really?  That's scary.
<b>PT:</b>	I didn't know that Yassaf Arafat was an engineer.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Go figure.
<b>DR:</b>	And, uh, what's his name, [NAME OTHER]'s an ophthalmologist and, you know, the Nazis love classical music.  Go figure, right?
<b>PT:</b>	And films, right.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, all right—
<b>PT:</b>	That's crazy.
<b>DR:</b>	You got the Zoloft, the Wellbutrin you take 1 of the 300s or 2 of the 150s?
<b>PT:</b>	I take one of the—
