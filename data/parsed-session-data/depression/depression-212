BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that's the logistical part of it.  So how have you been?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, I'm really starting to lose it.  We're having all this renovation.
<b>DR:</b> You started.
<b>PT:</b> They started two and a half months ago and they're not even close.
<b>DR:</b> Oh really.  What are they working on now?
<b>PT:</b> Today they were replacing two windows in the hall.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> They still have another, they have a whole bathroom that hasn't been demoed and they have stairs they haven't demoed or the railings, the kitchen is undone. 
<b>DR:</b> So you're kitchen is not finished because last time they were moving your refrigerator around.
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, the cabinets are partially in but they wanted the guy to come finish my bathroom and put the cabinets up because the granite is going to, I don't know, the granite is going to come -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Some time in, so the bathroom isn't even finished.  They didn't put up the glass for the shower, it's just like, I feel like I'm always going to live like this.  It's dirty, the guys are super nice and it's really nice company because everybody that comes to my house seems to be real pleasant -
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> And everything is as if they went out and hired nice guys.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But it's exhausting.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they're in your house five days a week probably.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah and they come at the crack of dawn.  You know, we have only one bathroom we can use, that's right, there's two other bathrooms, they're going to be retiled, oh, it's just, it's terrible.  There's another set of french doors and one more window and, I mean they haven't even done those other two windows and then, of course, there has to be stuff like re stuccoing outside where they cut to put things and what do you call that stuff that makes the wall -
<b>DR:</b> Sheetrock.
<b>PT:</b> Sheetrock.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know why I can't remember that, but in between windows -
<b>DR:</b> So did they have the -
<b>PT:</b> Then the patios have to be finished, those are the last -
<b>DR:</b> So they don't even have the outside work done.
<b>PT:</b> Well they have, no, I think they're working outside to try to take advantage of the half decent weather.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> But anyway, it's just like, I don't have that many things to go to, so I sit home and my dogs have to stay in a room because the guys leave the gates open or the garage open and they can run away.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It just, it's beginning to feel like a forever process, like we're always going to have paper taped to my floor, I'm always going to have people running around and the dirt and the dust and we don't have anything -
<b>DR:</b> Have they given you -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]  the other day, who knows, I don't know where it is, go buy more.
<b>DR:</b> Do they have idea how much longer they're going to be there, they haven't told you.
<b>PT:</b> I just guess by what they've done so far.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> In two months, two and a half months, what they've done and what still needs to be done and I don't know, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Do you think another two or three months possibly?
<b>PT:</b> I can see maybe, I would like to be optimistic and say six weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But who knows.  Anyway, it' s just like so, so it makes me all, I feel like I'm either snappy or depressed and going around and weird things will happen and I will, like yesterday, I had to go to the lab and have lab tests and so I went in there and I was the only person in there other than the lady and so I said hi.  I was in an okay mood and I gave her my little paper and she didn't take it and then she goes -
<b>DR:</b> Where was this?
<b>PT:</b> This was at a lab and it was like some young woman, [AGE], and so then she stood up and she opened the cabinet and she slammed it real hard, then she came over and took my paper and more sighing and then she opened some other cabinet, then she slammed them shut and I said if I'm disturbing you, I can come back another time and then she, again, and then she sort of tried to behave herself.  She handed me a cup and I just, you know, it's just awful and so anyway, I got home and I when [NAME OTHER] came home I told him about it, then I told him about it later and he said, he said just don't obsess about that, some people are just mean and he told me about a friend of his who got treated badly in a store by the store owner and, I don't know, it just seems like sometimes stuff happens like that and you just really, I just can't stop thinking about it, it's just -
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel -
<b>PT:</b> It's so annoying.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel like somehow you caused her to behave that way?
<b>PT:</b> You know, I always feel like there must be something about me that's causing that.  I didn't do anything.  I mean I said hi when I went in.  She was the only one there.
<b>DR:</b> So do you think saying hi was what caused her to behave that way?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Well, if it did -
<b>PT:</b> All I know is I must have really interrupted something for her to behave like, I mean there was, she just took these cabinets and just slammed them shut and all this big sighing and I don't know, it was so weird.  I didn't say another word after I went in to the back of the lab, when I left, I just left, I didn't say goodbye or anything.
<b>DR:</b> Is it possible that she was already upset before you got there and that you didn't cause her to behave that way?
<b>PT:</b> I suppose it's possible but I didn't do it.
<b>DR:</b> No, you didn't.
<b>PT:</b> There wasn't anyone else there.
<b>DR:</b> Well, no, but you don't know what happened that morning or on the phone or -
<b>PT:</b> Am I supposed to guess what people's days are like?
<b>DR:</b> No but what I'm hoping is that you won't blame yourself for someone else's bad behavior.
<b>PT:</b> Well I'm getting better at not doing that but it was very very unpleasant.  I was on the verge of just leaving.
<b>DR:</b> I can understand.
<b>PT:</b> You know, if I ever went back, I'm going to see if she's there, if she's there, I'm not going in, I'll go somewhere else.
<b>DR:</b> I think if people treat you that way, you have every right to leave.
<b>PT:</b> But you know, I think that it's sort of commonplace.
<b>DR:</b> More so isn't it, than it used to be
<b>PT:</b> I mean even with individuals, you know, I told you about that woman who is so bitter and ugly and I went to [DEIDENTIFIED] this weekend for a conference and I drove up a friend of mine and she's a non stop talker and if she wasn't such a positive nice person, you couldn't stand her, she talks so much but she started talking about this because there are a few people that know all about this, that witnessed it or someone close to them told them.  Anyway, she wanted to talk about this woman, I don't have an answer for her.  I mean over the years, she's been, oh my gosh, she claims my dogs, she walks this [INAUDIBLE] of dog thing and it's about, I don't know who this is about, me or her, but my dogs are three years old now and she came over to my house maybe when they were 6 months or something.  I have big dogs, my dogs are a big breed and then I have big dogs, they're big for what they are and they're fat and it must have been when maybe they were about 7 months old and [NAME OTHER] was oh my gosh, what a precious looking dog, he was just always golden fluff and he was big, he was really big.  He came out and she's like kicking him away.  I thought she liked dogs.  This is a puppy, you know, and he was big, you know, and I tried, you know, I had him calm down, you know, held on to him and everything.  I mean that's, that's like half of an incident.
<b>DR:</b> Half of an incident of -
<b>PT:</b> Incident of her being not authentic but that's the way she is.  I'm not sure what she is and anymore I honestly don't care.  I offered her a cup of coffee when I offered two of my friends a cup of coffee and she was there, she came there, and she just, no.  She could have said no thanks.  I didn't have to offer.  It was a logical thing to do when you're with some people and you're all sitting down and I'm going to get some coffee for myself and my other two friends.  I mean it was logical, polite, I don't know what it was.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so that's another example of someone being rude.
<b>PT:</b> But there are a lot of rude people out there.
<b>DR:</b> I know, it's true.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know what they're doing out there.
<b>DR:</b> And [PATIENT NAME] are you going around causing them all to be rude or is it just -
<b>PT:</b> Maybe, maybe I'm, yeah, I feel I have some sort of aura around me that says like sucker or that I don't have to be treated nicely or something, I don't know, it's a bad feeling.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] did you hear, did you hear there was a shooting across, yesterday some teenagers were killed?
<b>PT:</b> I did read that in the paper.
<b>DR:</b> And what I'm hearing is that it's becoming increasingly common for shootings.  Do you think those teenagers did something to cause that, cause themselves to be shot and killed?
<b>PT:</b> They were in a fight or something.
<b>DR:</b> They might have but does that cause them to deserve to be killed, shot.
<b>PT:</b> Everybody gets killed anymore.
<b>DR:</b> I know.
<b>PT:</b> People shoot people at schools, in malls.
<b>DR:</b> And do people deserve it, getting shot at the malls or at schools?  No, there are a lot of horrible things that happen out there, it doesn't mean that people are causing the perpetrator to do that to them.
<b>PT:</b> There's a lot of odd things going on that I don't understand.  I was reading a magazine and it brought up something, I didn't get to the cover article but it was like, I'm having disbelief in some areas like, you know, and I'm just, I'm not any kind of medical person, I'm just a layperson, where did this autism come from.  I never heard of people having it, never, not with my kids, not with, even with [NAME OTHER]
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> What is that, is that a made up thing?
<b>DR:</b> It's becoming a lot more common and no one knows why.
<b>PT:</b> I never even heard of it.
<b>DR:</b> No, as kids we didn't.
<b>PT:</b> Is it kids that just aren't very smart.  I mean that's always been the case.
<b>DR:</b> No, it's usually some, it's not necessarily smarts, it's not that they're necessarily mentally retarded, it's that socially they're restricted, they often have repetitive behaviors, they don't interact normally with other people.
<b>PT:</b> It could be this whole society.
<b>DR:</b> It could be, some people think it's a societal problem, some people think it's a biochemical problem, the truth is nobody knows why, they just know it's -
<b>PT:</b> Because I mean it's like I never heard of, I mean even when [NAME OTHER], he graduated from high school in 2000, I never in all the twenty years of kids going to school, I never heard of that.
<b>DR:</b> Yes. 
<b>PT:</b> Never knew anybody who had that.  I knew a couple of kids [NAME OTHER]'s age that had cystic fibrosis.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> But not this, this is like something, I feel like maybe there's something wrong with me that I don't believe in it.  I mean I guess I have to but I sort of don't.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], it's like, there's another newsweek out there that talks about the growing peanut allergy problem.
<b>PT:</b> What is that?
<b>DR:</b> There's a, for some reason, there's a growing number of people that are allergic to peanuts severely.  Some people even can have a deadly reaction to peanuts if they're in the same room with them. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I read that.
<b>DR:</b> And at the school, the elementary school where my daughter goes to school, they now have a peanut free table for those kids because they can -
<b>PT:</b> They don't have a peanut free school.
<b>DR:</b> No, they don't have a peanut free school but they have a peanut free table in the cafeteria.
<b>PT:</b> Do you think that's so reactive, just so - 
<b>DR:</b> Well, I used to, I used to, when I first heard about it, I thought this is people just overreacting.
<b>PT:</b> That's what I think.
<b>DR:</b> Until I found out more information.  I found out that there are kids dying from this.
<b>PT:</b> That's another thing I never heard of back in the day.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> You know, you get like peanut M&Ms;
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I never heard of a kid getting sick or dying or -
<b>DR:</b> It wasn't this common [PATIENT NAME], things are changing in our society, like you pointed out, not just peanut allergies and autism but rudeness.
<b>PT:</b> Well maybe it's something in the air where these mothers are getting this into their systems before they have their babies.
<b>DR:</b> It's as good a theory as any other out there, no one really knows.
<b>PT:</b> But I feel like, I feel very sad that there are kids out there that have this
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> And that they have peanut allergy, I'm so sorry about that too, I'm not heartless, I'm just, it's like there's something, well there is, I guess, something heartless about me that I can't quite -
<b>DR:</b> I don't know that you're heartless.
<b>PT:</b> In my whole life, never having ever heard of anything like these things.
<b>DR:</b> I think you haven't had much experience with it because in our -
<b>PT:</b> I went to public school.
<b>DR:</b> In our lives growing up, it wasn't as big an issue.  I never knew a kid that had autism or was allergic to peanuts in all my life.
<b>PT:</b> Did you hear of a kid?
<b>DR:</b> Not when I was growing up, never.
<b>PT:</b> When did you first find out about all this?
<b>DR:</b> It's really only been the last few years that I've been here.  Well, I learned about autism in medical school but it was very uncommon then.
<b>PT:</b> Right, then they made a movie about it.
<b>DR:</b> It's increasingly common now for some unknown reason and just like rudeness, rudeness didn't used to be so common.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], I remember just driving down the streets of [DEIDENTIFIED], people used to be polite, they'd let you in if you wanted to change lanes.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no they speed up.
<b>DR:</b> Now, you're taking your life in your hands.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I just sit back and take my last turn or whatever, that's okay, you know, I'm used to it now, it happens all the time.
<b>DR:</b> But that's changed hasn't it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> People have become much more aggressive in their driving.  Now are you causing all that aggressive driving and peanut allergies and autism and rude behavior.
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't think I'm causing it, I just feel sort of heartless.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> You know, sometimes little kids make me crazy, bad little kids.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> What I consider bad kids.  I was even with someone when we were around some kids misbehaving and I'm talking about the screaming and running in public places.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And we're talking and I thought, I used to tell my kids, you know what, go outside and do that, that's what outside is for.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I was in a laundry mat, I don't know, a year and a half ago because my dryer broke and I had to take my stuff over and there was this lady and all these little kids and the place was cavernous, it had all these dryers and washers and there were these kids all running and screaming and running down the isles and slamming the dryer doors and washing machine doors and I thought, this is so horrible, I can't even stand them, I had to go outside and wait till my stuff was, because I think it's mainly my age that I don't like all that.
<b>DR:</b> Well or the way you were raised, children were raised not to behave that way.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and my friends kids didn't do that either.
<b>DR:</b> Oh no, we'd have been punished.
<b>PT:</b> There's some laxity going on.
<b>DR:</b> Yes and [PATIENT NAME], you're not the only one that thinks this or feels this way.
<b>PT:</b> Really, do you hear that?
<b>DR:</b> All the time.
<b>PT:</b> Does it, do they feel as insensitive as I feel?  I feel like I'm like real insensitive, they were bothering me.
<b>DR:</b> You're much harder on yourself compared to most people, most people just angry and upset about it and think what's wrong with our society that these changes are happening. 
<b>PT:</b> Well, I just think you can say bring a book, bring a coloring book, bring your dolls to the laundry mat and don't do that.
<b>DR:</b> And [PATIENT NAME] again there are a lot of people that talk about this, how rude children are, all these changes, the difference is again that you tend to take it personally like you somehow are responsible and why is that, do you know?
<b>PT:</b> I tried to be good when I was little.
<b>DR:</b> Right, but you were taught to feel responsible for other people's behavior.
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, I guess.
<b>DR:</b> You were blamed for the way other people were so you assumed if somebody is behaving this way it must be your fault because that's what you were taught to believe, even if it's not true.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, like I've done something to, like that woman started hollering and screaming political and personal and all this bologna and I couldn't even make sense of what she was saying and felt like what did I do to start that.  I don't think I said anything and when she started on with [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> I don't think so either.
<b>PT:</b> We weren't even talking about [NAME OTHER] and I was like this is so insane, what are you even talking about.
<b>DR:</b> And [PATIENT NAME] yes that's a good point that people are the way they are, you don't cause them to be the way they are or act the way they act or think the way they think, you don't do that.
<b>PT:</b> I was just paralyzed but then I lapsed into bad behavior, I couldn't help it, it was like something rose up inside of me.  I know what it was, it was the mother bear.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> She started attacking [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Your daughter [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Why was she attacking [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> Because she doesn't like [NAME OTHER] because [NAME OTHER], this is so boring, it has nothing to do with anything.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I think you told me this, you didn't give her the money she wanted.
<b>PT:</b> She didn't give her coffee.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Because she didn't fill out the form and she wouldn't come to the store to fill out the form.
<b>DR:</b> That's right.
<b>PT:</b> She wanted special treatment.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER] doesn't work at home, now she does but she didn't have stuff at home.
<b>DR:</b> So this woman started attacking [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah because apparently she's been, this was years ago, years ago that this happened.
<b>DR:</b> And she hasn't let go of it.
<b>PT:</b> No.  So when she started attacking [NAME OTHER], it just kind of rose up because it was like, I don't know, even while you're talking about it, it's a lot of political stuff, I don't know what she was saying but, you know, when it got personal, she said don't you talk to me about you and [NAME OTHER].  I hadn't even said a word and I was like, stop it, what is this.
<b>DR:</b> So [PATIENT NAME] one of the hardest lesions for you I think has been to undo that condition you got as a child to take things personally, that somehow you're responsible for other people.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you're getting better at it, you're not nearly as likely to take things personally as you did in the past.
<b>PT:</b> I get all shaky, I don't say anything anymore and then, like  [NAME OTHER] said, he said don't think about that anymore, he says there's lots of mean people out there and then he told me this story about his friend.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> His encounter with a mean person.
<b>DR:</b> So [NAME OTHER] reaffirmed with you that it wasn't your fault that she behaved this way or treated you this way.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Did you believe [NAME OTHER] when he told you that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> So I need to tell somebody but otherwise it rolls around in my head.
<b>DR:</b> I understand.
<b>PT:</b> And you know, I think of calling you, it's little, like dumb things like the mean lady over the lab.
<b>DR:</b> But [PATIENT NAME] they are important because they all tie together, the mean lady at the lab, the mean lady at the conference.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean.
<b>PT:</b> Don't I seem to know a lot of mean people, unless I'm causing it, I'm causing the meanness in them.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] have you ever gone out and bought a new car and all the sudden you start looking around and everybody seems to have that same car and you never noticed it before, why is that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, why is that do you think?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> It's because we start looking for it, we're more aware of it, it raises to a higher level in our conscious awareness.  The same thing happens with rude behavior.  If it happens then we start watching for it and we see it in more places, it's always out there.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not out there looking for it, I'm out there trying to be safe.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> You know, that's what I want to be, I don't want, like I said about this lady that just [INAUDIBLE], not only did I drive her to [DEIDENTIFIED] but we roomed together and we attended this conference together and then I drove her back home after a weekend and I was like so tired from listening, I didn't know listening was so hard but -
<b>DR:</b> With some people -
<b>PT:</b> But she was very very nice.  She's not, she's just so nice, you know, that you don't want to say ssh, shh, so you just listen and I got real good at going uh-huh, uh-huh but I wanted just to be, I just want to be safe out there.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And it's funny a lot of people seem to like me.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> And then there's mean people.
<b>DR:</b> Unfortunately there are.
<b>PT:</b> And I feel like I just sort of get them once in a while and I go, I really honestly don't like that, it makes me feel not safe and like there's something wrong, something wrong with me, maybe I, maybe I did something but I went over the steps when I went to that place yesterday, I went over it and I just went in is all I did.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> The door was open and I just went in.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] when they flew the planes into the twin towers in [DEIDENTIFIED], did you think there was something wrong with the people in those towers that caused those terrorists to bomb them?
<b>PT:</b> No, they were just working.
<b>DR:</b> They were just working.  [PATIENT NAME], I would say that they were no more responsible for what happened to them then you're responsible for people being mean to you, you don't cause that.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want people to be mean to me.
<b>DR:</b> And I'm sure the people in the twin towers didn't want those terrorists to be mean to them either.  My point is though that we don't, you're not causing people to behave this way to you.  These people are the way they are and yes, the important thing is for you to learn how can you protect yourself, how do you be safe in this world.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess I could have just left when she didn't, when I held out my little piece of paper and she didn't take it, instead she sighed and got up and slammed a cabinet.
<b>DR:</b> You could have left.  Also you said -
<b>PT:</b> Where am I going to go now?
<b>DR:</b> You also said something to her about trying to clarify what -
<b>PT:</b> That's why I was disturbing her.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You were trying to see, am I doing something to cause you to behave this way and she didn't respond it sounds like.
<b>PT:</b> No, she didn't.
<b>DR:</b> So you were trying to clarify it but [PATIENT NAME] I think once you realize that you don't cause other people to be rude or mean or behave the way they do, you don't even have to ask that question, because you know you didn't do anything to cause her to behave that way.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't think I did but then I thought sometimes I think just my very presence is disturbing to people.
<b>DR:</b> Well [PATIENT NAME], if that was the case, I would be disturbed right now, do I look disturbed to you?  Well be careful how you answer that question.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if you understand what I mean.
<b>DR:</b> I think I do.
<b>PT:</b> Just my being, just my -
<b>DR:</b> I understand but [PATIENT NAME] -
<b>PT:</b> Breathing in and out.
<b>DR:</b> If that was true, wouldn't that disturb everyone around you?  If you were somehow toxic and radiating out toxic. 
<b>PT:</b> But something funny happens when I get, when I get involved, whatever, that's not really the right word, with mean people, it feels like other people that are not normally mean get mean.  Like I have a friend, I was talking on the phone and well she was telling me how mean she was to someone else.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And then she was sort of curt to me and I thought -
<b>DR:</b> So she told you she was mean to someone else, you didn't cause her to be that way.
<b>PT:</b> No, she told me what she had done and said to someone and I thought that sounds mean.
<b>DR:</b> So she was telling you up front, this is who she is, this is her personality, you don't cause her to be that way.
<b>PT:</b> It was real, you know, I don't like that, I think it's real threatening to me.
<b>DR:</b> I understand.  [PATIENT NAME], let me give you an example, when I was a little boy, I used to walk to [DEIDENTIFIED] elementary school every day and our neighbors two houses down had this dog on a chain, a little dog.
<b>PT:</b> That's mean.
<b>DR:</b> And every day I walked by and it barked, barked, barked, barked and I was always terrified that it was break that chain and come and attack me because it barked so viciously.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And I always thought what did I do to that poor dog, I was just walking to school.  Sometimes I tried to talk real nicely to it, it would still bark at me.  Sometimes I'd ignore it, it would still bark at me.  No matter what I did, just walking to school or walking home it would bark like that at me and I was so scared of that dog.  Now do you think I caused that dog to be the way it was.
<b>PT:</b> No, the people caused the dog to be the way it was by chaining him like -
<b>DR:</b> He probably needed being chained up.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.
<b>DR:</b> So [PATIENT NAME], but I didn't know that as a little boy, I thought, I thought that dog didn't like me and he was going to bite me.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, any kid would, I would.
<b>DR:</b> Of course a kid would and [PATIENT NAME] that's what happened to you when you were young, you thought that people were mean to you or treated you the way they did because of you, you didn't know as a child it was because of them.
<b>PT:</b> But it was about me, it was.
<b>DR:</b> How so?
<b>PT:</b> It was, I entered into the life, into their lives
<b>DR:</b> I'm sorry?
<b>PT:</b> I had entered into their lives when I wasn't welcome.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] I asked -
<b>PT:</b> I mean I didn't mean to -
<b>DR:</b> I was talking to a lady yesterday, she was so excited, she's going to be fostering a baby, she already has two children, she's going to be fostering this baby who doesn't have a safe place to go.  Now if she gets angry with that baby, is it the baby's fault?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> You don't mad at babies.
<b>DR:</b> No and she's very -
<b>PT:</b> You can't help it.
<b>DR:</b> Right, she can't help it, could you help it that you entered into these people's lives, did you choose, say I'm going to come into your life, did you do that?
<b>PT:</b> No, I didn't choose that.
<b>DR:</b> No, you didn't choose that.
<b>PT:</b> But the, it was me nonetheless, I mean I caused them, my actual coming into their lives caused the meanness.
<b>DR:</b> So you came into dad and [NAME OTHER] lives causing this.  Your dad didn't have anything to do with you coming into his life, even though he went and got you, he conceived you, before that he had nothing to do with it.
<b>PT:</b> Well he did but it was her -
<b>DR:</b> Maybe [NAME OTHER], so [NAME OTHER] had nothing to do with it, she didn't have any say.
<b>PT:</b> She might not have.
<b>DR:</b> And she didn't have any choice in the matter.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe not, I don't know
<b>DR:</b> What is she didn't like it, could she have left?
<b>PT:</b> I guess so.
<b>DR:</b> Of course she could have.
<b>PT:</b> But of course not, she wanted to be married.
<b>DR:</b> She wanted to be married so then she has to either accept what marriage is or not, that's here choice.
<b>PT:</b> But she can be mean on the side.
<b>DR:</b> She can and see I think she was mean on the side anyway, even before you got there.
<b>PT:</b> Really?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, maybe so.
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> But still.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have any evidence of that [PATIENT NAME], did you ever talk to anybody else that knew her besides -
<b>PT:</b> I can remember talking, hearing her talk about her mother.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> And she was mean.
<b>DR:</b> And didn't she have a daughter of her own.
<b>PT:</b> And I liked her mother, she was grand mom [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> And didn't she have a daughter?
<b>PT:</b> She had two daughters.
<b>DR:</b> And what about them?
<b>PT:</b> She wasn't real mean to them.
<b>DR:</b> She was nice to them.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So she treated them differently.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, she did
<b>DR:</b> Kind of like the -
<b>PT:</b> I mean I can get [NAME OTHER] on the phone.
<b>DR:</b> I believe you.
<b>PT:</b> She'll tell you.
<b>DR:</b> It's kind of like the Cinderella story.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly.
<b>DR:</b> The step mother.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah but it was just my presence caused that.
<b>DR:</b> And [PATIENT NAME] why do stepmothers sometimes behave that way to step children?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, I guess the easy thing would be, well it's genetics but -
<b>DR:</b> What is it?
<b>PT:</b> We look like every other child.
<b>DR:</b> Right, so why do stepmothers sometimes treat stepchildren differently than their own biological offspring?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, because they have the same genes, that's stupid.  People adopt children all the time and love them.
<b>DR:</b> Some people do [PATIENT NAME], some people do.  Did you just hear about the story of [NAME OTHER] over in [DEIDENTIFIED] with the girl's school? 
<b>PT:</b> Oh right.
<b>DR:</b> That the mistress was being abusive to the girls there.
<b>PT:</b> Right, right.
<b>DR:</b> Was that the girls fault where they did something wrong?
<b>PT:</b> No, she was a bad person.
<b>DR:</b> She was a mean person who was hurting these girls.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly. 
<b>DR:</b> I don't know the details, I just know that she was abusive.
<b>PT:</b> That's I don't believe everything they tell on TV.
<b>DR:</b> And [PATIENT NAME] there's some adults that just can be mean to children sometimes, it's not the children's fault.
<b>PT:</b> I remember yelling at my kids.
<b>DR:</b> Well, with our kids sometimes but that's different than what happened to you.
<b>PT:</b> Especially boys.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Because boys fight.
<b>DR:</b> Right, they do.  So [PATIENT NAME], again, the challenge here for you is to realize that you didn't cause [NAME OTHER] or your father to treat you the way they treated you.  They did because of who they were, not because of who you were.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, you can say that.
<b>DR:</b> I know.
<b>PT:</b> And I can hear it but it just feels like if I wasn't there, it wouldn't have happened to me.
<b>DR:</b> It's hard to sink, well, it wouldn't have, it wouldn't have happened, you wouldn't have experienced if you hadn't been there but did you choose to be there?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No, you were forcibly, you were forcibly put there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, conversely I don't what would have happened if I kept living with [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> It could have been very frightening there too.  I would have been, it was frightening when you were there at times.
<b>PT:</b> It was frightening, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So both situations were scary and unsafe.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You didn't have a safe place to go.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't think that being safe was real important but, you know, inside I do.
<b>DR:</b> It's the most important thing in our lives [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> I'm just trying to be safe and not, you know, it leads to icky things like trying to please people all the time, I can't do that, I don't even want to, why would I want to please mean people.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And yet I did, I used to try to do that, it's like some chameleon thing, I found out who in the heck are you anyway.  I didn't know who I was.
<b>DR:</b> Right, well we don't when we're trying to please other people because we sacrifice who we are to try to fit into their expectations.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> You know, sometimes, I guess this doesn't really have anything, well I guess it sort of has something to do with it, some people, some people have expectations of how you're going to be and they won't accept who you are.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Then like I have to be in my house almost every day with a bunch of guys hammering and sawing and, you know, they don't swear or anything, they're really nice.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> And then when I leave there, I just want to be kind of quiet, even when I'm not there, I just, I don't want a lot, maybe I just want to be, I don't know, even if I'm with people, I still want to be sort of quiet.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> People don't accept that.
<b>DR:</b> Some people don't, you're right.
<b>PT:</b> You know, maybe later I'll be lively but it's exhausting being in my house.
<b>DR:</b> I understand. 
<b>PT:</b> I know it sounds stupid.  I'm hoping it's going to be nice.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] it doesn't sound stupid.  Everybody I've ever talked with who has ever gone through remodeling said it's one of the most stressful things they've ever been through.  
<b>PT:</b> It's terrible. 
<b>DR:</b> It's very terrible, especially when it's the kitchen.  The kitchen is the most stressful difficult room in the entire house to have remodeled.  
<b>PT:</b> Two bathrooms, a kitchen, two patios.
<b>DR:</b> A staircase.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, another bathroom, the staircase, another bathroom is only, oh, three other bathrooms are only getting, I have a lot of bathrooms.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Two are powder rooms, are getting like new tile.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Is that all, I don't even know.
<b>DR:</b> It's a lot isn't it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and it's just, I need to just snap my fingers and get over it and some of the things have been a surprise to me, what the decorator's idea was and my idea was have been kind of shocking.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> So anyway, but the point is that when I leave that kind of environment and go to another one, sometimes I just have to just breathe a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, yes.
<b>PT:</b> You know, even when I go home and they're not there, there's still the tape and paper on the floor and uneven floors and we only have one bathroom we can really use.  How many do we have, we have a bunch, six, we have six bathrooms and we can only use one.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Now that might not be stressful to you but -
<b>DR:</b> Any change is stress [PATIENT NAME] and you have a lot of changes right now.
<b>PT:</b> It's awful but I just, when I go out and people I like, people are mean, you know, I just do want to go back in my house and just not go back out again.  It just doesn't feel like something I want to do.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, and I think [PATIENT NAME] it's important for you to find a way to feel safe and part of the way to do that is to realize when you're not causing people to be unsafe.  In other words, there was a man that used to live up in [DEIDENTIFIED], he was a photographer and he loved photographing grizzly bears and he would camp out right amidst the grizzly bears.
<b>PT:</b> Oh my gosh.
<b>DR:</b> He believed that if he was just nice to them and not threatening to them, they wouldn't bother him.  Well, unfortunately, he got eaten by some of the grizzly bears.
<b>PT:</b> Those are animals, they're big, they can just swipe off your head.
<b>DR:</b> Right and did he cause them to come and do what they did?
<b>PT:</b> No, those are animals.
<b>DR:</b> They were just being grizzly bears, that's what grizzly bears do.
<b>PT:</b> Those aren't people, people have choices.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly but often people react like animals, unfortunately, in that they behave the way they are because of who they are, not because of the way other people treat them.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I find a lot of people, not a lot, not a lot at all, some people, a few people that I know, okay, I guess what is the word I'm looking for, self depicting, sort of like that, I know a lot of people who push themselves up above other people.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Set themselves up over other people and, you know, for them it works and I don't think that would work for me so I'm not like that at all.
<b>DR:</b> No that's not your personality.
<b>PT:</b> But I've been around a lot of people like that.
<b>DR:</b> If anything [PATIENT NAME] you tend to put yourself below other people.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do that, I know that but it's hard to be around, it's hard to be around people who are better, better than I am.
<b>DR:</b> You mean who think they're better than you are.
<b>PT:</b> They tell me they're better.
<b>DR:</b> They tell you.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know how, I have no retort, whatever, for that kind of - 
<b>DR:</b> Maybe you don't need one, maybe all you need to do is realize that you're on an even par with anyone else.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Not better, not worse.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know and it's in a lot of areas, they will, what it is I think I'm trying to say is there are people who compete.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I think that's what I'm trying to say.
<b>DR:</b> Absolutely.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm really not a competitive person and I pretty much do my own thing and I do it in my way and I do it with my own resources and it's not for them or for anyone else.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And yet there's this, this sense that they're competing.
<b>DR:</b> It's you.
<b>PT:</b> I don't understand, why don't they do what they do with their own resources for themselves.
<b>DR:</b> Because [PATIENT NAME], some people use that competition to feel better about themselves.  They feel like if they win, if they have a nicer car or they know more about -
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm going to get a new car.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, or if they -
<b>PT:</b> And I'm sort of, I'm not telling anybody.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Because I just feel like -
<b>DR:</b> And [PATIENT NAME] will it make you a better or worse person if you get a new car?
<b>PT:</b> No, it will make me having this really cute new car.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  Now if someone else knows more about tea in China does that make them a better person. 
<b>PT:</b> No, that means they know more about tea.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, so that's all artificial.
<b>PT:</b> It is artificial and that's what, I'm not expressing myself very well, it's just that I don't like that position, I'm always in that position.  I've never been in like the competitor.
<b>DR:</b> I understand.
<b>PT:</b> I've always been the competitee I guess but I don't have any desire to participate in that.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, because when there's competition there may be a winner but there's going to be a loser.
<b>PT:</b> One thing I know, okay, this is kind of like, I know a man in AA and I know that his birthday is a few months after mine but somehow he always gets like ahead of me, like I don't care.
<b>DR:</b> In terms of sobriety.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he does, yeah, it's like, someone told me that and that's when I first noticed it.  You know, he always says his birthday is blah, blah, blah, you know, and yours is blah, blah, blah, I don't care, it's not a competition, it's not a game.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> It's whatever it is but he says these things out loud and -
<b>DR:</b> So he makes it into a competition, he wants to better you.
<b>PT:</b> Right, well, yeah, he'll say things like oh well, well like last year he said well we both have fifteen years now or something and I didn't even have fifteen years, he definitely didn't but it was like he, this person that told me this, we were laughing about it and it is funny, it's like what is the deal by leapfrogging over years but it's that same thing?
<b>DR:</b> So what drives people to do that, do you know?
<b>PT:</b> I have no idea.
<b>DR:</b> Insecurity.
<b>PT:</b> But everybody is who they are.
<b>DR:</b> Right but insecurity drives people to try to prove that they're better than someone else because they feel insecure, they feel less than so they're trying to prove that they're more then -
<b>PT:</b> He seems like a pretty assertive guy.
<b>DR:</b> He may seem like it on the outside but [PATIENT NAME] -
<b>PT:</b> That's so funny.
<b>DR:</b> What drives people to behave that way is that somewhere inside they feel insecure which is okay, a lot of us feel insecure somewhere inside, we just have different -
<b>PT:</b> About something, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Right, we just have different ways of dealing with it.  Some people respond to that sense of insecurity by becoming competitive and trying to prove that they're better than others -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> To try to make up for that feeling of insecurity.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm the only person that, I see him frequently, who has approximately the same amount of sobriety.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> It's like, I don't know, you know, I just have to laugh, I mean, you know, I really never noticed it so much until someone else noticed it.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And told me and we laughed about it and it was like ridiculous but what that is, is more of the same of this competition.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And I didn't ask to be there.
<b>DR:</b> No and [PATIENT NAME] the nice thing is you've made a decision or a choice not to participate in the competition.  You don't come back at him and say no you don't have more sobriety.
<b>PT:</b> You can get, you can feel kind of used or something or -
<b>DR:</b> Drawn into a little bit.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And [PATIENT NAME] you can but you can also learn to set a boundary and realize this may be his game but you don't have to play.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I usually don't.  I don't have a comeback if, like the new car, oh my gosh,  these people are going to see it, they're going to see it and I already, I told one person and they said well there's nothing wrong with the car you have and I said -
<b>DR:</b> Does it matter?
<b>PT:</b> You know, I wanted this new one.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But it made me look like I just squander money or something.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] maybe through their eyes, maybe they think you should drive your existing car until it drops dead of 200,000 or 300,000 miles but you know what, that's through their eyes.  You get to pick in your life with your money how you spend it and when and if your car has 2 miles on it and you want to get a new one, you can.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well now I'm sort of afraid when my car comes, it's the only car in my whole life I've ever ordered.  I didn't even know you could do that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And so I'm waiting for it.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I'm afraid when it comes, I'm afraid when they're going to see it.
<b>DR:</b> This one person?
<b>PT:</b> Well anybody, I kind of want to disguise it or something, make it look like my old one.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] what if some people are excited for you and happy for you that you got a new car.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, I can't imagine some of these people, like I can't imagine, I can't imagine it.
<b>DR:</b> Well if they're not happy for you, what does it say about them.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> It says that they're -
<b>PT:</b> They could get a car if they want.
<b>PT:</b> Just go get one.
<b>DR:</b> It says that for some reason they're not able to enjoy your happiness, your success, your new car.
<b>PT:</b> But then I feel like I shouldn't, the message I get is that I shouldn't be happy with material things, that I should only -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But we had to remodel our kitchen, I mean we had to remodel our house.  I mean what's being done is half common sense and half like fun.
<b>DR:</b> You know, [PATIENT NAME] I know that, you know, there's that message out there that we shouldn't be happy with material things.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But the truth is everybody is, it's a normal human response.  If we go out and get a new car and get to go drive it, it's going to be fun.
<b>PT:</b> Well I'm not even talking about like a, not even a $40,000 car.
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't matter does it?
<b>PT:</b> We're talking about a little inexpensive -
<b>DR:</b> If I go out and get a new bicycle and I'm excited about having a bicycle -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, right.
<b>DR:</b> Or a new watch or a new pair of shoes, if it's something I'm excited about, I'm going to feel happy about it, that's normal human behavior.
<b>PT:</b> I know people are not happy for me.
<b>DR:</b> And that's a different story, that's either because some people are jealous because they can't go out and by a new car or they're envious, they want to go get one and they can't or they're judgemental and they think people shouldn't do that.
<b>PT:</b> I have no options with people.
<b>DR:</b> With some people you may not, they may be judgemental of you and not be able to share your happiness with you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I just want to be a nice person.
<b>DR:</b> And [PATIENT NAME] you can be a nice person but it doesn't mean that everybody is going to like you because some people can't like you no matter how nice you are because they're incapable of it.
<b>PT:</b> I mean there's something inside of me that's just not nice enough maybe.
<b>DR:</b> No [PATIENT NAME] it's that something inside of them is so damaged that they're incapable of seeing you for who you are.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, it's just, it's just such a mystery.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> It's too mysterious.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] I'm watching a TV channel about, on chimpanzees and they show this one mother chimpanzee, her baby died and she was so traumatized that she went off and she killed another baby chimpanzee, she stole it from its mother and killed it and that was the first time they'd ever seen an animal kill another animal of its own kind like that.
<b>PT:</b> They're really smart.
<b>DR:</b> And they said it was because it was traumatized.  What did that other little baby do to deserve that, absolutely nothing?  What did that other mother do to deserve that, absolutely nothing?  The first mother was so traumatized, it was almost like she developed a severe illness from the trauma and she acted abnormally towards this other baby.
<b>PT:</b> Why didn't she just steal it and keep it for herself. 
<b>DR:</b> Don't know why she did what she did, we just know that she did it.  Now [PATIENT NAME] sometimes humans do the same thing.  Sometimes when humans are traumatized, they'll lash out and hurt other people.
<b>PT:</b> You know what I think I would do, I would just curl up in a ball.
<b>DR:</b> You probably would, you wouldn't lash out but [PATIENT NAME] other people lash out at you sometimes. 
<b>PT:</b> They do and it's like I'm inviting it.
<b>DR:</b> But you tolerated it, you haven't always fought back, as a child you couldn't fight back, it wasn't safe to do that because if you did the punishment would be even worse. 
<b>PT:</b> I was somewhere and this person was talking about, you know, if we're walking along and a lion comes up and you know all that stuff how we'd either run away or fight back and my first thought was I would just curl up in a ball and hope it didn't see me but then I thought to myself, this really unusual thought, I think now I would stand up and just fight with every ounce of strength I have.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, but in truth I'm not doing it.  I mean it's simply a desire to be able to fight back.
<b>DR:</b> I think it is [PATIENT NAME].  I think the desire finally, for the first time in your life, to not just take it when people are mean to you and I think you have every right to protect yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Well I didn't say anything mean back to that lady yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> No, you haven't.
<b>PT:</b> That was just like, that would be stupid, that's just ridiculous.
<b>DR:</b> But [PATIENT NAME], you have the right to stand up for yourself and protect yourself and be safe however you do that and that's what I think you're starting to grasp but you really do have that right to be safe in this world and you really do have the right to not tolerate mean behavior from other people.
<b>PT:</b> I just, I'm not, I just hate it.  I mean I get so upset.  I mean there have been times when I've just cried.
<b>DR:</b> I know [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> I don't have any other response, just balling.
<b>DR:</b> I understand but does it feel good?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], we have to stop because we're out of time but I'm really happy for you because more today than at any time since I've known you, I've seen you start to shift out of that self blame that you have been conditioned to fall back into, to realize that other people's behavior sometimes isn't okay and it's not your fault and you have a right to protect yourself and be safe and that's a really really wonderful thing to hear you talk about that.
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]'s friend who got mistreated by the wine store guy.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> He already knew that, he just pushed that bottle of wine back across the counter and said I'm never shopping here again.
<b>DR:</b> He probably didn't have a traumatic childhood that you had either.
<b>PT:</b> I don't think [NAME OTHER] will ever go back in that store.
<b>DR:</b> And good for him, he doesn't have to put up with that kind of treatment, he's a customer.
<b>PT:</b> I was a customer.
<b>DR:</b> And you don't have to put up with it either if you don't want to.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's just that they, you know, get out there and what I want is when I go out in the world, I want a safe place.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> I want a safe place out there.
<b>DR:</b> And [PATIENT NAME], the safe place is not going to be out there though, it's going to be in here.  It's when you learn to protect yourself, then you can walk out there amongst the people and be safe.  It's almost like you need a suit of armor to protect you because if you go out there, it doesn't matter where you go, if you're unprotected, if you're like a turtle without a shell, you're not going to be safe.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so now it's become so hard because there's so much chaos around me I don't -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I still stay home.  Yeah, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, let's keep working on helping you find a safe place, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> A way to be safe, all right.  Well, let's see, let me just check, I don't think the holidays are going to affect our appointments, I want to double check.  Yeah, we're scheduled for the [DATE] next, does that work okay for you?
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> Do you want me to put that on a card?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, please. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I have, I just have, my house is in such disarray, I can't even tell you, my clothes are all sorted out on a chaise lounge because I couldn't get into my, I keep all my stuff in a spare bedroom.
<b>DR:</b> Well, [PATIENT NAME] I hope the next time we meet, they'll be closer to being finished, very close I hope.
<b>PT:</b> I hope so, I don't know what the heck that is, I don't' have any idea what that is, oh well, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Anyway, I can hardly wait till that car comes.
<b>DR:</b> What kind did you get, are you getting?
<b>PT:</b> I bought a used mini cooper two years ago, I got a two year old car.  I've always wanted one and I got one, we put racing stripes on it.  I mean these are different than what you see because they were from like post manufacturing, whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> So this time, I'm, oh my gosh, I'm getting, I really can't show you a picture of it, a green convertible with a black top and it has leather seats.  Mine has cloth seats.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> It just, it's going to be so much fun.
<b>DR:</b> Great.
<b>PT:</b> And a convertible opens up to a sunroof in front.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, it sounds like a lot of fun.
<b>PT:</b> I think it'll be fun.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> But anyway, I never knew you could just go pick a car.  I mean I've only had two new cars in my whole life.  We just go the car store and just I'll take that one or whatever, mostly we have used cars and that's fine with us.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> So when you get something brand new, it's wow.
<b>DR:</b> It's exciting and fun.
<b>PT:</b> It is fun.
<b>DR:</b> Good, good for you [PATIENT NAME].  All right.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not the car, the car is not me.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> It's just my, it's just my transportation and this is what I'd like it to look like.
<b>DR:</b> And it's nice you picked something that's fun for you that you can enjoy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Take care.
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> Bye bye.
<b>PT:</b> Did I put that card in my purse?
<b>DR:</b> You did, you put it inside your book.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
