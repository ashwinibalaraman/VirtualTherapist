BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, how are you holding up?
<b>PT:</b> Not well.
<b>DR:</b> No?
<b>PT:</b> Um, for the sake of time, I wrote it down.  I'm sorry it's so long though.  
<b>DR:</b> That's okay. That sounds like a major nightmare.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  I'm on a medical merry go round.
<b>DR:</b> Big time.  And you still have no answers.
<b>PT:</b> And I've spent a lot of money.  So I need an interpreter because there isn't, uh, a great understanding of [INAUDIBLE].  And the risks that you take when you take anything, and because of past trouble with bowel blockage and emergency room, I'm trying to stress this to this doctor.  Unfortunately, if he can't give me his magic pill, I'm on to another doctor.  I don't believe that they really know what is causing this problem because many things can cause this.  So it's anybody's best guess and everybody got diverted with liver cancer and didn't concentrate on the bathroom thing at all.  That was left aside, which I can understand if they suspect cancer, but apparently the systems extremely small.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But they did rule out cancer of the liver.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  And yesterday I saw the uh neurologist which is the latest one on this trail of doctors.  Um, and I had a terrible time with him because first of all, I understand that smoking is terrible, I mean I'm [AGE], I'm not a fool.  I know.  Um, so this, this all this time spent telling me about all of this was wasted when he could have been concentrating more on what's happening to me.  Um, and it was almost as if he knew what he was going to do until I gave him your card.  And he saw the medication listed there.  And suddenly it put up a brick wall.  And then, there was this trying to dilly dally around about the risk might be not very much, you know, maybe I can talk to your psychiatrist and we could work out which one would be less risky and all of this, which is fine, but I just don't want to end up in the emergency ward again.  And I'm trying to protect myself 'cause I can't, I can't keep up with these medical costs.  I have no word if I'm going to get any assistance for funding and yet the bills keep mounting.  They aren't pressing me for payment because they know I've applied.  But if I get turned down, they're all gonna show up at my door and want payment and, yknow, I mean, it's as if, I have a choice.  I can risk taking a pill that could cause me more medical trouble with the possibility of slowing down bladder problems or I can continue on this round of doctors.  It's very possible if I go to a gyneco, no I've been to walk-ins, the primary, the urologist and the gynecologist and it's very possible that the gynecologist could send me to an endocrinologist thinking it was my thyroid because any number of things can cause this trouble.  And if I can't take their pill, they send me on to the next one.  And there is a great miss, lack of understanding of MAO.  
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> They don't realize that the risk is to me, that I'm the one that's going to be ill, in emergency.
<b>DR:</b> Bowel blockage and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm paying for that now.  I have a bleeding hemorrhoid because of it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> It's the problem is that most of those, if not all of the medications that your [INAUDIBLE] bladder spasm, they're all anticholinergics that slow down the bowels, every single one of them.  I'd have to look each one up separately in terms of, you know, safety with an MAO inhibitor.
<b>PT:</b> Well and this risk factor is a very iffy thing.  It depends on the person's point of view.  Um, because when they gave me medication for nausea, the doctor's office felt the risk wasn't that great, but when I was at Walgreen's, I always ask because if MA is MAO is so questionable, I always ask whenever I take anything.  The pharmacist didn't feel that way when I told him about the previous trouble, he called the doctor because he knew.  But if the doctor's office didn't feel that the risk was so great, then so there's a difference of opinion on how, on, it just gives you a percentage, but it depends on the person.  And I seem to have a high uh incidence of being the few percent that has the trouble.  I don't know if it's because I'm extremely thin, but -
<b>DR:</b> I - well, first of all, the medication you're on already has a slowing effect on your intestines.  It has anticholinergic effects to it.
<b>PT:</b> Well, and actually that's good because I tend to be, have diarrhea a lot because of my nerves so it balances it out.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly. Yeah.  But the problem is that you then take something that's more anticholinergic to help with the bladder, I've got two anticholinergic drugs and if you'd had problems with bowel blockage before, I do think it would be, behoove any of us to think twice about putting you on another anticholinergic.  Um, on the other hand, you don't have a diagnosis yet as to why this is happening.
<b>PT:</b> And I probably won't.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um, how long has it been going on for now.
<b>PT:</b> Since March, four months.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have pain when you pee?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I just, I have abdominal discomfort.  I have the constant feeling, I mean even after I urinate, um, I stand up and feel that I have to go again.  And I know there isn't anything in there.  I just did it.  
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Although it is possible to not be able to completely empty your bladder.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>DR:</b> So, in fact I saw someone this morning with that problem that could not empty her bladder.
<b>PT:</b> Hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Um -
<b>PT:</b> Well, my neighbor has a nerve problem.  And her nerves, I mean because of it, she has nerve damage because of that she has to cath herself every time.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Because she can't go.  And I'm going too much.  We need to balance each other out.
<b>DR:</b> But they've, they already checked you for diabetes and it's not that.  
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So, you know, and it's not an infection 'cause -
<b>PT:</b> Right.  
<b>DR:</b> They treated that.  They checked cultures and, right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.  
<b>DR:</b> Now there is a condition, overactive bladder syndrome.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And -
<b>PT:</b> Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly. Yeah, um -
<b>PT:</b> Yes, the urologist was telling me about this.
<b>DR:</b> Which is an extremely difficult to treat situation because it doesn't always respond to medication.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  
<b>DR:</b> Um, there's another thing called interstitial cystitis, which is even more chronic, and, um, in fact this came on fairly suddenly, I, I don't think it's interstitial cystitis, but, um -
<b>PT:</b> Well, now his latest guess is age.  When everything else fails, it's how old you are.  
<b>DR:</b> Well, what I would wonder is whether your bladder has dropped and whether you need a bladder suspension.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I had this bladder exam yesterday.  He stuck something up in there and at the time he was doing it, I told him that my mother had a fallen bladder and when they attempted to put it back in is when she died.  Uh, of course she was [AGE] and at that age, surgery is difficult.  But, um, her, her cause for it was difficult childbirth.  I've never had children and when I told him about this fallen bladder, he said, well you don't have that trouble.  So I don't know if that's, he could tell that from examining me or if it was a guess.
<b>DR:</b> A ur, a urologist should be able to tell you exactly - 
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> It was a urologist, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so he would -
<b>PT:</b> I think, I've been to so many I can't remember who's who anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um, the one's that usually do the repairs there are the gynecologists though, if there is a fallen bladder.
<b>PT:</b> Well now, the other problem too, is, I mean I'm not built right.  Uh, so I haven't seen my gynecologist for quite sometime because he can't do a pap test on me because my cervix is so high and it's locked up like a safe.  He can't get in there to get a sample.  So what's the point of trying to go for a test he can't do it.  It took a hysteroscopy for him to look in there to see if there was a problem because I didn't stop my period until, uh, last August.  So it hasn't even been a year.  
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm [AGE] years old.  And this is why the urologist suggested that it could be change in hormone that's caused this.  And that previous attempts at hormonal therapy didn't work because I wasn't in menopause, even though they thought I was.  That seems questionable.  And that now that I am, my hormone balance may be all out of whack.  And this is causing this trouble.  I don't know.  I'm not a doctor and that's why I thought maybe the two of you could discuss this because I don't know.  And I don't have any way of telling them the limitations that I have except for your little card.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Who's the doctor, is it [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> I wrote it.  I wrote it down and the phone number.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Now, he said he would be in today, but I didn't realize you were so busy and that you've been gone.
<b>DR:</b> Will he be in tomorrow?
<b>PT:</b> I have no idea.  
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  
<b>PT:</b> I don't, I can't keep up with the schedules.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, I'll, I'll get to it tomorrow.  I won't be able to do it today.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  
<b>DR:</b> Um, 
<b>PT:</b> Well obviously, I've had this trouble since March.  It's -
<b>DR:</b> And then I'll, and give me your phone number too.
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  Now I left him in a very upset state so I'm not sure that he is even willing to discuss this because I walked out.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'm, I'm just so frustrated and I'm going to the poor house while they can't find the answer.
<b>DR:</b> Do you know what it was he wanted?  What was it that he wanted to give you?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, he didn't specify.  He said there were several.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, there -
<b>PT:</b> And that's what he was gonna talk to you about, I guess, which one prevented the least risk factor.  And then when I said this business about, yknow, I wasn't supposed to, I mean, even the emergency ward doctor told me, tell them not to give you anything that's gonna block your bowel, uh, because it blocks my, apparently the two are very close together and my bladder was blocked.  Nothing came out.  
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.  
<b>PT:</b> I was in such severe pain.  I though I was having a child.
<b>DR:</b> Do you remember what caused that though, what were you on that caused it?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  After my mother passed away, uh, I was afraid or, because that's where she was.  And I explained to them how I had depression and this was difficult, the passing of my mother was so difficult they gave me a tranquilizer.  
<b>DR:</b> And that's all it -
<b>PT:</b> And I don't recall which one, but I didn't take it 'cause of the fear of interaction, but my aunt and friends were so concerned about my mental stability at the time because I was so torn up about my mother's death that they encouraged me to take it.  And within a week, I was in excruciating pain.
<b>DR:</b> Was it like a Valium type medication?  [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b> It's been like seven years ago.  
<b>DR:</b> Oh Boy.  
<b>PT:</b> But -
<b>DR:</b> Whatever it was that [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> The first time it happened, I wasn't even on the Nardil.  But what happened was, I went my doctor because I was having terrible headaches.  And he must have seen my mood and figured that this could be depression and gave me an antidepressant, I don't know which one.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I took it for a short time and it didn't seem to help my headaches.  I have continued to have headaches.  And so I stopped it all on my own.  I just stopped taking it because it wasn't helping.  And a month later, I developed a bowel blockage and the doctor told me it was a slow build up, that built up in my bowel because of what I had taken a month before.  It just stopped everything and it keeped, it kept accumulating.
<b>DR:</b> I can't imagine them giving you um - what they give you was -
<b>PT:</b> I never completely eliminated.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but what they give you for anxiety seven, well, when your mom died would have had to have been a Valium like drug.  I don't think they would have given you any -
<b>PT:</b> And I didn't take it, but people kept pushing it on me, take this [PATIENT NAME] yknow, you need to take this.
<b>DR:</b> And that has a very, very timely chance of causing that.  What it tells me is that you don't have much reserve in that nerve system.  So when it comes to anticholinergics, I agree, you shouldn't be on any.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, 'cause you got two bowel blockages.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So -
<b>PT:</b> And I have physical problems now because of it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And there's also, uh, I was told quite some time ago, that there's a loop in my bowel, which could cause a blockage if things don't move through it.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Because there are times when I have pain there and I think it's because things don't go around the track.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, sometimes -
<b>PT:</b> Or gas or something.  It's just the physic that, I mean I got a lot of physical things that aren't right, mitral valve prolapse, depressed breast bone, my teeth aren't all there, yknow, my parts aren't all where they should be.  And this scoliosis on the, that report, that, I've know about that for years.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I saw that. Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And osteoporosis, which is part of the reason I try to take [INAUDIBLE] calcium which could be causing this stone problem.  Because I do believe that I had a stone in [DEIDENTIFIED].  The doctor just didn't realize it at the time he thought I had appendicitis.  
<b>DR:</b> Well, I'll give [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] a call and then I'll get back to you, uh, I don't have any patients scheduled tomorrow so, I'll just doing paperwork and making phone calls so, all right?
<b>PT:</b> I mean, it, I unfortunately my discussion with him made it sound like I was just adamant that I would not do anything, but it is because I've had so many problems.  I don't want to end up in emergency again.  And I realize it's tying his hands.  He has a limited amount of resources and if he can't do that, he doesn't know what to do so I get bounced onto the next doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and then it may be that, um - 
<b>PT:</b> The thing that really, I don't quite understand is in all of this circus of things, realizing that, that bladder trouble can be caused by many things, nobody has taken a blood test.
<b>DR:</b> I don't know what a blood test would even do for [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Well, maybe there's nothing to it, but it seems kinda odd to me, I've been to an ultrasound, an MRI, urine test and, uh, all of these things and nobody has looked at my blood.  The last things always be the first thing people tell you to do, you know, urine and blood.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, usually, but in this situation when it comes -
<b>PT:</b> Well, maybe it doesn't apply.
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't apply.
<b>PT:</b> No, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well I'll talk to -
<b>PT:</b> And I have lost weight.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because my eating pattern is all out of whack.  My sleep is all out of joint.  I sleep maybe three hours at the most at a stretch and then I'm up in the bathroom.  Uh, then I go back to sleep and then I'm up again.  And I don't get the kind of sleep I should, therefore I never feel well.  My nerves are short.  My temper's short and this is what happened yesterday.  I went to this appointment on three hours' sleep 'cause I spent the night in the bathroom.  And so I didn't have a whole lot of patience with the doctor and he, this business about the smoking just sent me through the roof because I realize it's terrible, there are a lot of terrible things, yknow, people eat the wrong things, they drink too much, they drive with cell phones, I mean there's all kinds of things people do, but the focus is so adamant on smoking that it just, it, it really gets on my nerves.  I know it's bad.  I know it's terrible, but I'm not the only one who's doing terrible things here.
<b>DR:</b> Well, what I'll do is, I'll also look up the medications that are available for urinary frequency and see if any of them are non anticholinergic.  I know a majority of them are.  I don't know if there's any that are not.  Um, now you've tried the antibiotic thing -
<b>PT:</b> Now -
<b>DR:</b> The other -
<b>PT:</b> If you talked with him and it would be better to talk to me again, I would be willing to come back and see you.  Unfortunately, my, my appointment with him yesterday did not go well.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It just, I mean lack if sleep and everything did not go well.
<b>DR:</b> I'll expl - yeah, I'll explain that to him so - okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm losing my temper.  I'm losing my money.  
<b>DR:</b> This is, part of this is the - this is a typical response to insomnia and yet when it comes to the insomnia, I can't put you on anything either.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I have to go to the bathroom.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, exactly.
<b>PT:</b> But I'm getting to the point where I think I'm just going to have to pee in my pants or have a catheter put in and wear a bag because nobody seems to be able to solve this and I don't have the money to proceed on this medical merry go round.  And it's affecting my depression.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I can't go anywhere or do anything because I'm locked to this porcelain bowl.  We have formed a personal relationship, the bowl and I.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, I'll, I'll have to discuss it with him and then see, um, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> But this bowel problem, it, it is significant.
<b>DR:</b> Oh I, yeah, that's very clear.  So, 'cause if they just gave you, I didn't care what class of drugs it was for your nerves back then.  It would have had to been something that of course would have been safe with the MAO inhibitor, so I'm thinking it's probably, knowing what they give in the ER, probably Lorazepam.  And that risk of causing bowel problems, and blockage with that drug is very slim because it's anticholinergic effect is very, very low, which means you've got no buffer zone whatsoever.
<b>PT:</b> If I ate cottage cheese, it slows me down.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So -
<b>PT:</b> I mean that's the only cheese I can eat.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah so they need to understand, and I'll talk to him about that, it may be that his hands are tied, um - 
<b>PT:</b> If I have to go to the gynecologist, I will try, but this is really getting to the point where I just see an endless stream of doctors, the gynecologist could send me on to the next one.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And if they can't do anything medically for you then they should have you meet with someone who can tell you how to readjust your life to live with it.  
<b>PT:</b> I guess.  I mean, I don't know how you can when you're going every twenty minutes or half and hour.  I mean right now, as I sit here, I have to go to the bathroom.  I always have to go.  And now I have diarrhea on top of it because I got so upset.
<b>DR:</b> Well, the question I have is, is it bladder or is it urethra.  
<b>PT:</b> Hmm.
<b>DR:</b> I had a very similar problem that lasted for fourteen years.  And I went to numerous university urologists.  I told them anatomically exactly where the problem is.  They went right past it with the scope and right into the bladder.  They never, they never even looked.  I was so frustrated they wouldn't listen.  I finally got to a urologist in a small town where I was practicing, um, we were friends and practiced in a small town like that.  So he listened.  And he found a little area of inflammation at the very base of my urethra.  It wasn't in the bladder.  I mean, the others just bypassed it.  And I went through the same thing.  There was one night I recall getting up fifteen times to urinate.  And here I am in medical school.
<b>PT:</b> Oh my gosh. Oh boy.
<b>DR:</b> And I'm like, I mean, I went through college that way.  I went through medical school that way.  I went through the first several years of my marriage that way.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> I was like God [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I've only gone through four month and I can't stand it.
<b>DR:</b> It's horrible.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It, it, so I understand what you're talking - 
<b>PT:</b> And I have never been like this, ever.   I mean I haven't even, I don't, I try not to hold it too long 'cause that's not healthy, but, I mean, I can go a long time without having to go because I don't consume a real lot of fluid.  I know I should drink more than I do.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So this is totally opposite.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Mine was knocked out with just a one-week supply of an anti-inflammatory drug.
<b>PT:</b> Hmm.
<b>DR:</b> This doctor had never seen this before.  He called down to one of his former professors at the [DEIDENTIFIED] and he told him he had seen it before and the first thing you do is you start with an anti-inflammatory.  If that knocks it out, fine, if not, then you go in and remove that part surgically.  And it knocked it out in like two days.
<b>PT:</b> Well you know, now [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] gave me a vaginal cream to put down there because of the discomfort, but unfortunately, I mean you have to go all the time you wipe it off.  
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Exactly.
<b>PT:</b> He said, put it on at night before you go to bed.  Well, that doesn't matter because I'm up in the middle of the night going to the bathroom so it gets wiped off.  It isn't on there long enough to help any.  And believe me, after that test yesterday of him going up in my bladder, I couldn't even sit down for a while.  I'm so sore.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  
<b>PT:</b> I feel like I've been sitting on a picket fence.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's not pleasant.  So I, I'll go ahead and I'll call him and we'll see what we can come up with for this.  This is a miserable condition and then, but the concern that I have is -
<b>PT:</b> And I can't afford and I realize I wasn't the best patient yesterday, but this MAO is extremely hard for me to come across to them about when it always starts, do you have any allergies, at which point I say, I take a medication that has restrictions and I pull out my little card.  I carry it with me.  
<b>DR:</b> Right.  
<b>PT:</b>  They read the card, but I don't think they get it.  And then, you know, it's just like in the discussion of what's wrong with me, that's left in the background and then all of a sudden there's this brick wall because I say I don't think I can do that, I'm on an MAO.   It's like there's a, there's a misunderstanding here about the limitations.
<b>DR:</b> Well part of the problem is no one's been, no one's been using MAO inhibitors for years.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.
<b>DR:</b> In my opinion -
<b>PT:</b> It's not common, therefore people don't realize.
<b>DR:</b> Not like, you're the only one in my practice right now on an MAO inhibitor.  People are, will be learning more because we now have an MAO inhibitor patch that people can wear.  I haven't prescribed it yet.  But I've got samples of, but I can't get anyone that even wants to take an MAO inhibitor even though they, this is pretty nonrestrictive and you don't have to adhere to a diet if you're only on 6 mg of a day.  So, you can eat anything.  There's still the medication restrictions though.  And the other thing is -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  But, but, I mean, in order to have the amount that I take -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you'd be on more.  So I don't think you'd be able to switch.
<b>PT:</b> So, I mean how could, you be not with the food restriction if you had to take more?
<b>DR:</b> Right.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  
<b>DR:</b> That's the problem, yknow, I mean, you can tell someone might not have the food restrictions, but the status is not in yet.
<b>PT:</b> See with me, the food restriction isn't a trouble because I don't like eating.  
<b>DR:</b> It's the medication.
<b>PT:</b> I do it to live.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I do it by the clock because I don't feel hunger.  Something's wrong there too.  And, um, I've never been an eating person and when I get upset, I don't eat instead of eating too much, I'm the opposite.  
<b>DR:</b> The opposite.
<b>PT:</b> And I've always been on the thin side.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So, you know, I mean maybe pizza's trouble cause I love pizza and I can't have it.  And I can't drink coffee any more, which is probably better that I can't.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And I can't drink alcohol, which is probably a good thing because there's too much alcoholism in my family, but yknow, generally speaking, I'm the only, I go out with people shopping and they don't understand why I don't ever stop to eat.  
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't care.
<b>DR:</b> Well, let's go ahead.  I'll get in touch with you tomorrow.  I'll get in touch with you either way, okay?  I'll call him, if he's not in, I'll let you know that.
<b>PT:</b> Now, did you want that copy of the MRI thing?
<b>DR:</b> No.  I don't think I need it.
<b>PT:</b> That's just about my liver.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Now I left the MRI with him -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.   That's fine.  As long as they ruled, as long as they've ruled out - 
<b>PT:</b> Because I don't care -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> What happens to that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, if like there's an original MRI still back where you had it done if you needed it again.  Okay, so why don't you set up an appointment.  You have enough medication [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't know.  I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you do.  Yeah, you do.  Okay, so I'll get in touch with you about that then tomorrow and we'll see what we can come up with, okay?
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
