BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: ...of a piece I guess. So, things are bad.
THERAPIST: I'm sorry to hear that.
CLIENT: I'm not very good at conveying information about how I'm doing to anyone apparently. It's nothing happened to kind of prompt that. I just was thinking about that. Like I don't ? really bad. (PAUSE) I don't know how to make that mean anything for other people (PAUSE) [00:01:00]
Maybe I should say I don't know how to let that mean anything to other people. (LAUGHTER) But... (PAUSE) What do you do?
THERAPIST: Hmm?
CLIENT: I said, "What do you do?" (CRYING)
THERAPIST: What comes to mind?
CLIENT: Well... (PAUSE) I've already kind of cut back on the things that like I am responsible for and I'm doing things that are supposed to help and... (PAUSE) [00:02:00]
It, It's hard to, it's been hard to kind of keep up the momentum in the last couple of days. Like, I, I just... You know, I'll be walking down from one place to another and I just can't think of a good reason why I should keep walking. Or why I should eat or why I should take a shower or any of the things. (PAUSE) And, you know, like, you know, it'll be like a couple of hours of that and then a couple of hours of okay and then couple of hours of being able to work again. (PAUSE) [00:03:07]
(inaudible at 00:03:47) Not out of thinking obviously. I can't stop thinking. (LAUGHTER) [00:04:05]
THERAPIST: I got the impression there might have been a response you wanted there from me or something after describing what, you know, what you did about how things have been.
CLIENT: Not that I can think of. (PAUSE) Maybe... (PAUSE) I don't have much to fill the space (inaudible)
THERAPIST: What if it's not?
CLIENT: I'm sorry?
THERAPIST: And if not?
CLIENT: I don't understand. [00:05:07]
THERAPIST: Sorry. (PAUSE) What is it like if the space isn't filled with more stuff.
CLIENT: Quieter. I'm sorry.(LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: You kind of asked for that.
THERAPIST: I walked into that one.
CLIENT: I don't know. That's about right. (PAUSE) [00:06:00]
For me this (inaudible) not things getting done (PAUSE) is some kind of tipping point for some combination of talking about this enough in here and really not having the energy just kind of shutting that up. I say, "Well I know that that's not true." And even though I don't feel like that's not true, I also don't care. (PAUSE) [00:07:00]
It's not just that nothing is getting done it's that I'm not making myself heard when I'm not talking. And I think, "You know, I can talk." I can communicate, people will listen. I can talk to you. (PAUSE) [00:08:00]
I don't have the energy for... (inaudible) I figure out what I'm going to say as I say it, you know, so I'm just constantly rephrasing things as I'm saying it. Like If I try to say what I mean in slightly different words or use a different combination of word or use the exact right words then maybe will make sense to somebody else. (PAUSE) [00:09:00]
And it works (inaudible).
(PAUSE) [00:10:00]
THERAPIST: I wonder if you're having a reaction maybe somewhat generally and also (inaudible) been here just now, to what you have been talking about this week. I guess it occurred to me somewhere late yesterday that you had come in saying, you know, you say you didn't feel like you couldn't string a sentence together and wound up. Like, for the first time since you've been coming here, like talking about your mother. [00:11:09]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And... Go ahead.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) I was thinking while I was waiting there. You know, I've been reluctant to do kind of late afternoon sessions because I feel like, I just feel badly you're not home already.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: You know, like, well, in some things I crack open more easily when I'm exhausted. (LAUGHTER) It works. Yeah. And Dr. (inaudible) told me to stop taking (inaudible) until the side effects went away completely and then try it again at a half a dose. So it's not in my system now. [00:12:09]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:12:14)
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: I'm just tired.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
(PAUSE)
CLIENT: I don't know what kind of reaction you have in mind. I thought you were going to...
THERAPIST: I think I probably wasn't sort of clear. I guess what I meant was (PAUSE) I think you've been sort of putting your toe in some pretty difficult upsetting stuff that you probably have been warding off for a long time and what you're talking about this week and (PAUSE) stirring that up. (PAUSE) Maybe part of what's making you feel bad and making it hard to talk again. [00:13:35]
CLIENT: That makes sense. (PAUSE) It's not as though I haven't talked about these things before. It's that I've talked about them before a whole lot and (PAUSE) it has not felt as though that talking about them made any difference in any way at all. [00:14:23]
And... So, as far as I can remember I have kind of as I got into adulthood... I don't know, just said, "Well. It is what it is. I can't make them different. I can't make things have been different."
THERAPIST: I think you've kept yourself at some distance from the feelings that go along with this. [00:15:05]
CLIENT: I mean I certainly do now. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: I mean, like we were talking about earlier. It seems to me that... I guess the clearest way I can explain it is that I think at points over our last two sessions, you were, I mean, both of us were struck by certain things that, not having said more, that your mom or about how you missed her or some things you felt for her. I guess it seems to me that we were both sort of struck that you hadn't realized that you hadn't talked about it. And then similarly on Wednesday I think it was, seemed to me like (PAUSE) there were feelings where it was sort of clear how you were not putting things together or not feeling certain things that were clearly associated with the stories you were telling. [00:16:21]
CLIENT: Yeah, and it's still much clearer to you than it is to me.
THERAPIST: Okay. Okay.
CLIENT: I've got that in my mind at least. (LAUGHTER) You've noted that for me.
THERAPIST: Alright. (inaudible)
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
(PAUSE) [00:17:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I feel like I'm stretching a bit. I don't feel like I necessarily (inaudible) feel like where you're at.
CLIENT: I don't know. (PAUSE) I don't know. (PAUSE) [00:17:55]
I mean in, it's felt to me this week as though in some ways, talking about my mom and talking about my childhood and talking about these things has been (LAUGHTER) has served as something of a distraction from (LAUGHTER) how bad I've been doing.
THERAPIST: I see.
(PAUSE)
CLIENT: Oh a problem. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) (inaudible) good? (PAUSE) [00:19:00]
Yeah I just felt really bad.                                                   
THERAPIST: Yeah. Really bad.
CLIENT: And like... (PAUSE) Just instead of that, like it's so bad that it, it feels, I don't know. (PAUSE) [00:20:00]
It'll be really really horrible and then it'll be like I'm somewhere else or that reality seems less real. (inaudible) And then it'll just go away. And I don't know why. I didn't do anything and it'll just go back and I don't know why. (PAUSE) [00:21:00]
(CRYING) I just want to die. (PAUSE) That's not one of my choices so...
THERAPIST: No but it is how you feel.
CLIENT: Yes. (PAUSE) [00:22:00]
(PAUSE) [00:23:00]
A friend of mine, the other day, (inaudible at 00:23:09) e-mailed me yesterday and just was like, "Hey! I haven't checked in for a while. How are you doing?" And (inaudible) That's the only way I can remember remember to answer things (inaudible at 00:23:27) I mean, I'm not dead yet is about all I can think of. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Yeah. That would be the most candid.
CLIENT: Well, I don't know that that would be the most candid but that's all I could think of that would be true that I would want to tell him. (PAUSE) [00:24:01]
He'd probably take it pretty well. (PAUSE) Do other people really not feel like this? Like I just don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Other people, most other people don't feel like this. [00:24:55]
CLIENT: Okay. I mean, most. Some people do (inaudible). I was watching a documentary on Hamlet. That's what I do with my time. And, you know, there's talking about the "to be or not to be" speech as this gorgeous existential thing and talking, you know, the narrator was saying, "Well, you know, I do think at some point, everybody feels like this or has asked that question." But I don't... (PAUSE) I don't know. I mean, I believe that but people don't seem to understand what I'm talking about. [00:26:03]
You know, that speech, that's literally what you say. No one would stay alive if they weren't afraid of going to Hell if they did kill themselves. Like that is what that speech says. I'm not saying that's what it means but that's what he's saying. (PAUSE) That makes sense to me. But... (PAUSE) I don't know. (PAUSE) [00:27:00]
What's wrong with me?
THERAPIST: I don't know yet.
CLIENT: Thanks. (CRYING) (inaudible at 00:28:25) (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Sure. (PAUSE) And when you say that you want to die and that you can relate to Hamlet something like that...
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Oh God I just said that didn't I? Oh that's embarrassing. (LAUGHTER) Sorry. [00:29:09]
THERAPIST: You know there are some things that I understand about that and then there's things that I probably, that I don't. I am clear that you are hurting so badly that you just want to be done. But (PAUSE) I'm not sure what the pain feels like, where and how you feel it, you know, what the sort of, bigger picture question of what's causing it and stuff like that. [00:30:07]
CLIENT: Would it be helpful if I talked about (inaudible)?
THERAPIST: About what it feels like? Sure.
CLIENT: Right now I'm just really tired.
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: You can just sit if you want to just sit.
CLIENT: I know (inaudible) (LAUGHTER) [00:31:01]
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
(PAUSE)
CLIENT: I have like images of violence against myself just like flashing through my head occasionally. (inaudible) assuaging the pain rather than making it worse. (PAUSE) [00:32:05]
I feel helpless and just being an election year is bad because I, I keep thinking this and saying it that just I keep getting more cynical about the world and I can never keep up with the curve. Like I'm never cynical about for what's actually happening.
THERAPIST: I see. [00:33:11]
CLIENT: (inaudible) strikes in Pakistan. What the fuck do I do about that? I don't know how to live in that world. (PAUSE) You know, that hurts and I can't do anything about it. (CRYING) It feels like everything that hurts me I can't do anything about. [00:34:11]
THERAPIST: And what hurts you about that?
(PAUSE)
CLIENT: That, that the person I voted for is responsible for it. (PAUSE) That everyone is waving their hands and saying, "Oh this is a big deal," and nobody is doing anything about it or can do anything. I'm not doing anything about it and I don't know what I can do. And I can't even actually listen to the news so I really can't do anything. (PAUSE) [00:35:07]
You know, that... I don't understand how it didn't occur to anybody that, "Oh. If we put people in constant fear of being killed than maybe their lives will be negatively impacted even if they don't actually die." Like, really, really? [00:36:01]
And I can't decide whether it's worse that people didn't think about that or that people thought about it and didn't care enough not to do it. (PAUSE) That people have some magical idea of justice whereby, you know, it's okay for entire communities to live in terror if we kill one or two people that we think deserve to die. (PAUSE) And I can't think about that very much because I want to kill myself. (PAUSE) [00:37:00]
You know, I have friends who will say it's irresponsible, or who have told me it's irresponsible of me not to pay attention to the news, not to follow, you know, the political campaign and I don't know what to say to them. [00:38:04]
Or actually, what I say is maybe that when I watch the news I want to kill myself so I don't watch the news. (LAUGHTER) I say it in that tone of voice and I don't know whether anything, whether any of that is taken in by them and, you know...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) It's kind of not fair of me to say, like to put that on them, like... (LAUGHTER) Because they have to either decide to believe me and then they're in a situation that they don't know how to handle or they decide that they're not going to believe me. Which is usually what happens I think. (PAUSE) [00:39:00]
(PAUSE) [00:40:00]
I don't know what do to what I can't fix. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: Um. (PAUSE) (inaudible)
CLIENT: Yes.
(PAUSE) [00:41:00]
(PAUSE) [00:42:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, I think you can't bear the disillusionment or, you know, or the terror that you also know about or the destructiveness which is something you also know about. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: I don't like disillusionment. (PAUSE) (inaudible) applies but it's not like this was surprising to me at all. It wouldn't have been surprising a year ago. It wouldn't have been surprising five years ago. Probably would've been surprising to me ten years ago but not that surprising. Yeah. (inaudible) (PAUSE) [00:43:15]
You know, like... It's like when my mother about is a bitch it's not like it's surprising. Somehow it always manages to be surprising when she hurts me. (PAUSE) [00:44:00]
I feel really bad for saying that about her. I mean, when she is a bitch even though it's really actually about the best words to use, I feel really bad. (PAUSE) [00:45:00]
It may be worth it to get contact lenses. Then I won't have to take my glasses off everytime I cry. It makes me really uncomfortable not to be able to see you. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: And that's why I'm constantly taking them off and then putting them back on again.
THERAPIST: Oh okay.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Do you know what is uncomfortable about not being able to see me? [00:45:59]
CLIENT: Related to or the same reason I was uncomfortable yesterday feeling fuzzy headed because I can't see your expression. (PAUSE) Yeah. It's not exactly feeling as though I can't like protect myself. It's more feeling like there are connections that I could be making but I'm not.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Well I pay attention to you. [00:47:03]
THERAPIST: Do you mean connections with me or among the things we're talking about?
CLIENT: I don't know. With you and about you and about what we're talking about (inaudible). Yeah. Sorry. (inaudible) self conscious but... (LAUGHTER) You probably had to get over that awhile ago. (PAUSE) I mean I also find it very reassuring to be able to see you actually. (PAUSE) [00:48:00]
I was just thinking about getting home. Like the process of getting there. [00:49:07]
THERAPIST: What about it?
CLIENT: I don't like (inaudible). I guess I can walk or I can take (inaudible). One is about five minutes longer than the other. Tedious bus ever (inaudible) people. It's just... I can't, you know, it's hard to come up with good reasons to keep moving. (PAUSE) [00:50:01]
Yeah. I could call James to come pick me up (inaudible) and that's not very much fun.
THERAPIST: Do you want to just sit in one place and cry?
CLIENT: I just sit in one place anyway. That's about what I've been doing. Well I made pumpkin bread today which I haven't made or tried for a while. (inaudible) Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:51:17]
(inaudible) After a while it always feels like I'm resting instead of like bracing against the pain. (LAUGHTER) (inaudible)
THERAPIST: You what? [00:52:09]
CLIENT: Or it goes away a little bit. Or I get bored (LAUGHTER) I mean, I feel like that's the best thing for it. Eventually you get bored of being in pain so much and that helps it go away or something. I don't know. (PAUSE) [00:53:00]
(PAUSE) [00:54:00]
And then on the other hand, I think of all the things that I should be doing or I should have done and that's really hard. Yeah. It doesn't hurt in a way (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: (inaudible) opposite. (PAUSE) [00:55:00]
I hate to be so helpless. I think about the things that I actually could do something about and I feel helpless about them also.
THERAPIST: Yeah there's some kind of dramatic activity that goes on with this. (PAUSE) And that you get really angry with yourself for and I guess also (inaudible). [00:56:07]
CLIENT: Probably. You can tell that I'm angry at myself. (PAUSE) Yeah. The, the worse things get, the less I can do anything. [00:57:01]
It's terrifying to think about (inaudible) terrifying to think about the, the things I am not doing. I feel so helpless.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Well why don't we stop for now.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: We'll talk more.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Thank you. Take care.
