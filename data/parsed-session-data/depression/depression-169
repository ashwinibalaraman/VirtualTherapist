BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Oh you know, [PHYSICIAN NAME] one of the reasons I’m on it [INAUDIBLE] with my husband, it’s because I had a very bad roommate that was referred to me by a so-called friend that I don’t talk to anymore because he wound up having a drug problem, he was always high.
<b>DR:</b> Who the roommate or the friend?
<b>PT:</b> The roommate, the roommate.
<b>DR:</b> You told me about this roommate that he was very messy and that [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> No I took another one that moved out in October and then right away my friend told me…
<b>DR:</b> So you had someone who was able to pay the whole rent so you didn’t have to worry about the rent.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he was, he got a little obnoxious because he didn’t want me to be in my own apartment, he wants to take over the apartment.
<b>DR:</b> So he acted like it was his?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and he had to go. And he was getting very religious Orthodox because he wants to live on the [DEIDENTIFIED] near the [DEIDENTIFIED] and he was starting just to be too much of a pain. He didn’t want to live there anymore. He wanted to go live on the [DEIDENTIFIED] so then right away I told my friend that I have a room available so she sends this guy over that was living in her apartment rent free, but helping her daughter play the violin because he was a violinist and, you know, he was okay but then I noticed his behavior was bizarre. He was always high and breaking things and moving things around. He was up all night and sleeping during the day and it was just like, you know, he had to go and now I called this roommate service and they tried to help me. They tried to find out about me.
<b>DR:</b> Hold on, so let me get back. I saw you three months ago. You did well in the [DEIDENTIFIED]. You were more stable, you’re making jewelry, your appetite was good, you were doing yoga, your energy was low, you’re not suicidal, your sleep was fine, you’re tired all the time. 
<b>PT:</b> Yes [INAUDIBLE] tired.
<b>DR:</b> We thought, in the context of your chronic psychotic disorder, to drop the Klonopin down to 1 mg at night or between 0 and 1. We tried to let you reduce it. Were you able to reduce it?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, but the reason why I have my Medicare.
<b>DR:</b> Hold on, hold on. I want to be very specific. 
<b>PT:</b> I wanted to come today, not next month, because I thought my medication isn’t that good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay but I need to know exactly what you’re doing. You reduced the Klonopin down to what?
<b>PT:</b> At night it’s 1 and then the morning it’s a half, but lately I’ve been upping it because I haven’t been feeling that good.
<b>DR:</b> Why? What’s the matter, have you been anxious?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I’ve been anxious because everything is up in the air in my life. You know about this roommate, money coming in, it makes me nervous.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Even to have a roommate makes me nervous so it’s just hard coping and then everything. I just try to take it one day at a time but I would have came in March…
<b>DR:</b> Hold on, hold on, let me continue. I don’t mean to interrupt you. You’re also taking, we reduced your Lexapro down to 10 mg, are you taking that?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And we continued your Risperdal at 3 mg.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You’re taking that, right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. So in these three months, how has your mood been?
<b>PT:</b> Well, in the last week or two I noticed I’ve been very anxious and yelling at my husband.
<b>DR:</b> Hold on, but before the last week or two, how have your moods been?
<b>PT:</b> Fine.
<b>DR:</b> You were doing okay for two and a half months.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So your mood was stable. Were you hearing things?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Were you paranoid?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You were getting along okay with your husband?
<b>PT:</b> So-so, yeah. I haven’t seen him for almost a year and I don’t know if I miss him or I can’t stand him.
<b>DR:</b> But you were here for the three months, you were in [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I haven’t seen him since last April.
<b>DR:</b> Were you getting along with people in [DEIDENTIFIED] with people in your world here?
<b>PT:</b> Well that’s what I want to tell you, you know, I had a friend that has psychological problems and I had a fight with her and I feel that she tried to mess into my business and into my life and I don’t like that. So she says I’m an angry person and I should leave her home and, unfortunately, I gave her as a reference for my roommate service.
<b>DR:</b> All right. So, when did you have this conflict? When did you have this conflict?
<b>PT:</b> About a week ago.
<b>DR:</b> All right but up until then, for two and a half months that I hadn’t seen you, you were not having conflicts?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And then what happened two weeks ago. What changed?
<b>PT:</b> The anticipation of not getting a roommate [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well when did you lose the roommate you have?
<b>PT:</b> About a month ago, but I had money to cover the rent more or less for January.
<b>DR:</b> So it’s in the setting of money trouble.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> That you’ve been more stressed out.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And that’s over the last two weeks?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And then what has happened over these two weeks? You had the fight with the friend, what else?
<b>PT:</b> Well she’s a mental case and I don’t think that she has business…
<b>DR:</b> That’s okay, what else has happened? You had the fight with her, what else? What else…
<b>PT:</b> Everything else is all right. I’m fighting with my husband because I blame him for all the things he didn’t do properly. And I…
<b>DR:</b>  Okay, you mean on the phone you’ve been having fights with him.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> But I guess he can always hang up.
<b>PT:</b> I call him back and he says oh it’s you again and he suddenly was nice.
<b>DR:</b> As if you didn’t just have a fight.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well that’s nice…
<b>PT:</b> He says he loves me and he wants me to be with him and all this and he keeps on encouraging me to go be with him. 
<b>DR:</b> In the last two weeks, have you been hearing anything that’s not really there?
<b>PT:</b> No. 
<b>DR:</b> Have you been getting a little paranoid?
<b>PT:</b> Well my cat has claws and he likes to play with me all the time. I’m a little afraid of him. Sometimes he acts very rambunctious and you know he threatens me but I do like the cat…
<b>DR:</b> But that’s not paranoid.
<b>PT:</b> They are some of the reasons why I can go see my husband this month, it’s because I didn’t have a roommate but I couldn’t leave the cat alone and I asked a neighbor in my building to watch the cat for a month and she said she would only watch it for two weeks so I had to cancel my plan or else I would have been with my husband. So, I was upset about that I think a little bit too. I’m very lonesome.
<b>DR:</b> Is anyone trying to hurt you in any way?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Are you, have you been confused lately, hard to focus and concentrate.
<b>PT:</b> Well I asked a friend of mine if he would come with me to [DEIDENTIFIED] housing to fill out an application for a roommate because I’m afraid to go myself. I feel too confused to do that so he said he would come with me, not this week because it’s too cold, but next week we would go down together and he would go…
<b>DR:</b> So over the past two weeks, things have gotten worse. What’s the worst thing that’s happening to you?
<b>PT:</b> Just that I feel lonesome. 
<b>DR:</b> So you’re more sad?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I feel like I have no friends.
<b>DR:</b> Do you cry?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes. 
<b>DR:</b> How frequently? Every day?
<b>PT:</b> More often than before. In the last week or so I noticed I’ve been more upset. If I watch a movie and it’s very sad then I cry, and I just feel that you know…
<b>DR:</b> Do you think you’re crying every day?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Do you ever get into sobbing?
<b>PT:</b> Not that much.
<b>DR:</b> Not that much meaning never or once in a while?
<b>PT:</b> Just once or twice in the last two weeks. 
<b>DR:</b> How’s your self-esteem? Do you feel like you’re no good?
<b>PT:</b> Well I’ve been making my jewelry and I got into a store and she said there was a lot of interest in this necklace…
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> I sold and that she wants the name of my company that I’m going to have. I’m going to name my line [DEIDENTIFIED] and she did my phone number and I would take orders.
<b>DR:</b> That’s terrific.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You should bring some here. I’d like to see it.
<b>PT:</b> Well I made this necklace.
<b>DR:</b> Wow, it’s beautiful.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and I’ve been doing consistently my necklace work but this is what I wanted to ask you because this is the real part of getting confused. I don’t know, my husband wants to be with me and if I go to [DEIDENTIFIED] you know what [DEIDENTIFIED] is?
<b>DR:</b> Yes I do.
<b>PT:</b> They’re going to put time [INAUDIBLE] and tell me what to do and try to control my situation more and I don’t really want to be involved too much with the [DEIDENTIFIED]…
<b>DR:</b> Well, I think you’re a little misguided. [DEIDENTIFIED] is a system that helps give you some structure and helps give you some skills to move forward. I don’t think you should worry that they’re going to do anything that constrains you.
<b>PT:</b> Well then I think I should apply because I have a computer and I have the Internet and I don’t know how to work it. I don’t use it… 
<b>DR:</b> Well, your sister can help you a little bit can’t she? 
<b>PT:</b> She doesn’t come over because she lives in [DEIDENTIFIED] and my cousin doesn’t come over. They always want me to go over there.
<b>DR:</b> I would love for you to find a day program or some structured environment where you can go to get support.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, maybe I should go to [DEIDENTIFIED] because it takes time to get into their program.
<b>DR:</b> I really think you should go.
<b>PT:</b> And maybe I could make extra money.
<b>DR:</b> Is there any way I could help?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I was going to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] about a year ago and then I didn’t do it and my psychologist had written the papers and she had gotten mad at me because I didn’t go down there with them but she wrote basically the profile that they wanted. I think she could just, I could take them back to her and have her just change the date on the report. 
<b>DR:</b> Do you want a new therapist? I mean do you want…
<b>PT:</b> I like my therapist because she encourages me to do the jewelry.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b> And she makes me feel good about that.
<b>DR:</b> She can call me also and we can all get together in pushing you forward into [DEIDENTIFIED]. I don’t think you should be worried at all that it will constrain you.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I can go and come whenever I want.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, absolutely. Do you- and you’ll get a caseworker also, that will help you. 
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I find it more pressing now that I don’t have a roommate and I’m worried about money, you know, so I think if I’m involved with [DEIDENTIFIED] I’ll have more job skills and I’ll be able to maybe get a part time job and do my jewelry at the same time.
<b>DR:</b> That’s right. Do you find that you get pleasure normally, are you able to enjoy things?
<b>PT:</b> Well the only thing that I’m really enjoying is this guy that I know that I’ve known for five years that comes over to see me and that’s the only thing that I have, I enjoy.
<b>DR:</b> What’s his name?
<b>PT:</b> His name is [NAME OTHER] and anyways, besides that-
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and…
<b>DR:</b> Is he a boyfriend, is he your boyfriend?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know, we have a casual relationship, but I’ve been seeing him for a long time, ever since my husband left. He was a customer of mine.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And is office is near my house and he comes over after work or during the day and we have a little fun. But you see what I haven’t…
<b>DR:</b> By fun you mean you have sex?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I haven’t been having orgasms with him since I’ve been on Lexapro.
<b>DR:</b> Lexapro can do that but it sounds like you’re depressed enough that we don’t have the luxury of pulling it away unless you really want- I mean normally I would say we could pull back on the Lexapro but now is not really a good time, you’ve been crying a lot, you seem sadder than you were.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How’s your appetite?
<b>PT:</b> It’s okay.
<b>DR:</b> You gaining or losing weight?
<b>PT:</b> Well, [INAUDIBLE] therapist [INAUDIBLE] doctor I had and said that he would put me on some powder drink to lose weight and my therapist says oh, but lately it looks like your face is a little thinner over here, that you’re losing weight because you’re running around to do the jewelry.
<b>DR:</b> Are you- let me move on. Are you sleeping okay?
<b>PT:</b> I’m sleeping okay.
<b>DR:</b> I mean do you get to sleep when you want to, you sleep a full night, and you wake up when you want to in the morning.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Do you ever feel that life’s not worth living?
<b>PT:</b> Well, sometimes it’s very confusing and it’s not a [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> But do you feel like you want to die?
<b>PT:</b> No, not really.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel a bit overwhelmed? 
<b>PT:</b> Yes, because with the financial problems.
<b>DR:</b> So you feel almost helpless.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel hopeless?
<b>PT:</b> Well I have to, I could go to [DEIDENTIFIED], I could do more things, I have this opportunity with the jewelry. 
<b>DR:</b> So you don’t feel especially hopeless?
<b>PT:</b> No I feel that in the spring I’ll be selling my jewelry more. I’ll go to flea markets and [DEIDENTIFIED] has offered to buy, to sell my jewelry there and my niece wants to make me a jewelry party in April for her friends to come and buy my jewelry so I’m getting support from people but I just feel lonesome and I do feel that I miss my husband. I wish I could have gone in January and I wish I didn’t have this crazy roommate.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, you know, life’s been stressful for you but I think you’re doing really well. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I think you’re managing it as best you can and there’s a chance you could be starting to get a little depressed but I don’t think you’re there yet. I think you’ll be able to turn this around without us needing to raise your antidepressant. What I’d like you to do it this, I want you to come back in about three months. You don’t need to see me that much and, you know, you don’t need to spend your money.
<b>PT:</b> How long have I been here since?
<b>DR:</b> I’ve been seeing you since [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Doctor, how long has it…
<b>DR:</b> Three months. I saw you three months ago.
<b>PT:</b> So, it’s on time.
<b>DR:</b> You’re exactly on time.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Here’s what I’d like you to do. I think you’re going to turn this little mild depression around within the next week or two. If you don’t, in one month I want you to call me, okay? Can you remember that?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I want you to call me in one month if you’re still, if your mood is not back to normal.
<b>PT:</b> All right. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> What can I do to change?
<b>DR:</b> Well, you’re doing all the right things. You’re starting with [DEIDENTIFIED] and you’re taking your other medicine. Now, on the Lexapro, can you predict the days that you’re going to be having sex? Do you know which day it’s going to be?
<b>PT:</b> Not really.
<b>DR:</b> You don’t know the day before?
<b>PT:</b> No, sometimes I do and sometimes I don’t.
<b>DR:</b> If you know the day before, skip the Lexapro.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If you skip one day of Lexapro, you’ll be able to orgasm better.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, if you know the day before. Do you take it morning or night?
<b>PT:</b> Morning.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so if you think you might have sex that day…
<b>PT:</b> I don’t have to take it in the morning, I could take it if he doesn’t come in the afternoon.
<b>DR:</b> That’s right. Or even if he does come, you can take it after he leaves.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Do you understand?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You can take your dose of medicine after not before.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay but for now, I want you to stay on 10 of Lexapro, I want you to stay on the 3 of Risperdal, and stay on the dose of Klonopin you’re on.
<b>PT:</b> You don’t think I have to change the Klonopin?
<b>DR:</b> No, I mean even though it may be pushing your energy down a little bit, I think for your anxiety you really need it.
<b>PT:</b> I was taking a little more lately because I felt so anxious about not having a roommate and then I get this roommate, I sometimes I said this roommate might be a scam. I thought they were located on the [DEIDENTIFIED] but it’s not, they’re located in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Then I…
<b>DR:</b> Do you have to pay them?
<b>PT:</b> I paid them $85 and then I called them…
<b>DR:</b> They’re probably some online outfit that gets people, you know….
<b>PT:</b> I called them Friday at the time they told me and nobody answered the phone so I called them on Saturday and I think that’s when there was a lot of problems in [DEIDENTIFIED] with tornados and things. I think it might have affected them even though it wasn’t the area that they were in.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, listen, let’s hope that you have some good luck and that you get a terrific roommate and that things will go well. Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, give me a call in a month if things are better.
<b>PT:</b> What should I do about cleaning the house a little cleaner. I’m a little depressed to move out.
<b>DR:</b> I don’t know, do the best you can. You’re not allowed to the psychiatrist.
<b>PT:</b> I really don’t like to clean.
<b>DR:</b> All right, take care of yourself.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> I’ll see you in three months.
<b>PT:</b> And do you know what [INAUDIBLE].
