BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so I saw you a week ago—
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Just to review, all right, I filled this out for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	Did that, uh, I don't know, did we fax it?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she faxed it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we faxed it.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you hear from them?
<b>PT:</b>	I got a letter from them but it was significantly before that, so I'm going to call today.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you want a copy of this also?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Just to have for your records.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I let her know that I wanted a copy.
<b>DR:</b>	In fact, we should go through, uh, okay, I saw you [DATE] increasing job stress, increasing alcohol use, social withdrawl led to leave of absence for 30 days, you did well for a week, you were out, you dated some, you dropped your alcohol use, you and your ex boyfriend, you went out, we know the story—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You were heartbroken but when I saw you, you were starting to improve.  Fleeting suicidology, some insomnia, so we thought in the setting of your depression, your bereavement, your sleep dysregulation and your alcohol abuse, things were headed downhill—
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	And we decided to try a nighttime dose of Seroquel because it's, um, it's good for stabilizing mood, it's good for lifting mood—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	It's good for sleep, as you found, and it, it's also an antipsychotic, even though we're not using it for it's antipsychotic properties—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	It's antipsychotic, it helps together fragile thinking and you were quite fragile a week ago.  And then we maintained your 450 of Effexor, your 1 mg of Klonopin but you split it up, right?
<b>PT:</b>	2 mg.
<b>DR:</b>	1 mg twice a day.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	And, and you don't use Ambien anymore?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't have any Ambien.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	But you don't use it and the Valium—
<b>PT:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	Everything is still on your list but our hope is, and Valium you stopped—
<b>PT:</b>	I don't.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't have anything but Effexor and [INAUDIBLE] and the Klonopin which I'll need a refill of today.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, okay, what has happened over this past week?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, this week, taking the Seroquel—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, that just [INAUDIBLE] it knocked me out for—
<b>DR:</b>	Into a coma?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It happens that way sometimes but, um, usually it's—
<b>PT:</b>	A little tiny bit.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, usually if something works too much—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Then it's just a matter of finding the dose that, you know, titrating it to the point, but also the sedating effect wears off if you take it regularly.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So how small a dose did you get to?  I gave you the 50s, right, not the 25s.
<b>PT:</b>	You gave me the 50, I took the 50 and I  [INAUDIBLE] told me just to take half.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, I did, because I usually [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	The 50, yeah, um, but I didn't remember that at the time so I took the full 50, then the next time, the next day, I took the half and then after that, the next time—
<b>DR:</b>	Wait, what happened with the 50, how many hours did you sleep?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, basically the whole day but—
<b>DR:</b>	You took it at what time?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, just [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	So 10 or 11 at night.
<b>PT:</b>	Not much later than that.  [INAUDIBLE] sleeping so often—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I know—
<b>PT:</b>	You know, like 1 or something.
<b>DR:</b>	Because often when we get these over, you know, all drugs will wear off eventually—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	So the earlier you take them—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	The better [INAUDIBLE], so often when people have this, I have them take it at 6, 7, 8:00, often, because they're awake at those hours, there's a bit of a delay in the reaction, then when they're ready for a normal sleep at 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, they're down, they stay sleeping and then it's worn off by 8, 9, 10 in the morning.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, um, after more than 8 hours, it definitely had worn off.
<b>DR:</b>	It had, so what time did you take it then?
<b>PT:</b>	I didn't [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Was it after midnight?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, [INAUDIBLE] at night.  I took it after we spoke, you know, right before bed.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, okay, and then so you slept all day the next day?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	And were you like comatose?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you ever taken Benadryl?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my eyes were like this.  Yeah, I've—
<b>DR:</b>	Have you ever taken Benadryl?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I think I did because, of course, doctor friend recommended it a long time ago, um, but I don't remember if that—
<b>DR:</b>	Did you get a similar reaction?  Some people are just hypersensitive to taking this stuff.
<b>PT:</b>	I take Benadryl sometimes when I break out and—
<b>DR:</b>	Right and this doesn't happen to you?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] my body but it's [INAUDIBLE] but other people complain that it causes them to be drowsy but when I'm at work, you can basically put anything into me and I'd still look very alert.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  All right, so you slept the whole next day and the next night, what did you take?
<b>PT:</b>	And then I did the half and the same thing happened.
<b>DR:</b>	You slept the whole next day?
<b>PT:</b>	Waking up at 6, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And then you stopped it.
<b>PT:</b>	And then I did the half and then I did a quarter.
<b>DR:</b>	And of course, you then weren't going to sleep until very late anyway.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I haven't gone to sleep at a normal time for—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, when I saw you, you said you were getting no good sleep, so at least you got some sleep.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I think you had a [INAUDIBLE] in your sleep then that you needed to make up.
<b>PT:</b>	That might be true, because definitely it was, I was definitely—
<b>DR:</b>	Have you felt rested in any way?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I mean I was [INAUDIBLE], uh, my eyes were like that [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	And once you woke up—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Six, 7:00, what's your mood been like?
<b>PT:</b>	My mood was good but then it's like, oh my God, I've lost the whole day.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, so there's the sleep and the anxiety—
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm going back to work in 3 weeks and now it's extended [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	What might your mood be lifting [INAUDIBLE].  It's been a week since I saw you—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Might your mood be lifted a little?
<b>PT:</b>	No, because as I get closer to the end of my [INAUDIBLE], I get more and more nervous.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, so, well, you're nervous about something, so your mood, you're anxious all the time?
<b>PT:</b>	I would say, yeah, my back, my muscles are really acting up, even though I'm exercising, um, on a daily basis.  I rearranged my living room so that I could [INAUDIBLE] those exercises, um, trying to eat more protein, eat more regularly because when your sleep is off, you're eating ridiculous—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Things, [INAUDIBLE] of course may be the problem at work.
<b>DR:</b>	What is your appetite like?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not really that hungry.
<b>DR:</b>	Your appetite is low.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And are you sad?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You're sad and anxious?
<b>PT:</b>	Very anxious.
<b>DR:</b>	All the time.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	How's your self esteem?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], um, I'm trying to keep [INAUDIBLE], it's tough.
<b>DR:</b>	So you kind of, underneath you feel like you're not there.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], I'm scared, trying to get out of this.
<b>DR:</b>	What frightens you, I'm not sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I have the schedule [INAUDIBLE] schedule, my first week taking care of myself, the second week cleaning up the apartment and organizing all that, um, and it's only been the first week really and then going back to work, of course, it effects me [INAUDIBLE].  Okay, now 5 weeks have now gone by and I don't feel like I'm making any progress, although I made that progress the first week, which had stuck with me and I don't, like if I drink, it's not like this incredible craving that I feel like, I do not have the willpower to say no.
<b>DR:</b>	Why do you have to compartmentalize it so much though, I mean if you went back to work tomorrow, can you do the rest of this while you're at work, you just, you would not [INAUDIBLE] that because that's what people do.  You kind of, you set this task up for yourself that you inevitably fail, don't do that to yourself, you'll just adapt, you know, it can't be okay now this week, if I don't finish those goals by this week, it's over, all or nothing, if I don't clean up the whole apartment—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm not, I'm not progressing in anything except that first week, I mean all I have to do is look back, how many times did I leave the neighborhood, 5 times, how many times did I go out, did I try to keep myself busy at night and I did a great job with that, this past week, something fell through—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you had a bit of a setback but, again, with your cognitive behavioral work, the worst thing to do to yourself is to get stuck in the all or nothing mindset, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Catastrophizing minor things.  You're doing the best you can, you're adapting, you've got big problems and you'll manage them.  The worst thing to do is to not go back to work because that will help structure you a little better.  Um, it would be nice to make some gains in—
<b>PT:</b>	No, because it won't cause so many of the issues, because it was nights, nights and weekends but I've already told them that I can't, they said we'll do anything to arrange your schedule and I said, good—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I said after—
<b>DR:</b>	They very much want you.
<b>PT:</b>	The doctor doesn't want me working nights, well then he's [INAUDIBLE], yeah, but my plan is to go back to do something else that could bring the money in.
<b>DR:</b>	Something like what?
<b>PT:</b>	The business development thing and I was hoping that the last couple of weeks that [INAUDIBLE] last month that I was going to be putting out feelers and getting everything set up so when I went back, boom, I'd have, um, I found out who to be in touch with at corporate development, um, what to get in touch with in [INAUDIBLE] that didn't seem to have to do with this, try and bypass the whole ridiculousness.
<b>DR:</b>	You still have 3 weeks.
<b>PT:</b>	Well that's what I'm telling myself, just forget about that first month, you still have that thing about the alcohol, now you feel like you have no willpower, it's huge.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you drinking?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah but just like last minute, if, um, my back, my tension is like this, it's like I'm only—
<b>DR:</b>	But, so you drank that one time, how about before then?
<b>PT:</b>	And I drank the night before and that was it.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, any suicidal thinking?
<b>PT:</b>	In this last week when I saw you, it's coming across my mind.  I mean I have a girlfriend that asked me to, she's just going through a breakup and asked me to come on Sunday and spend the day with her while all the moving was going on, getting stuff out, and I said sure but I'd written her back and said, it's really important, I said, I spent the last 2 or 3 nights by myself because of these cancellations with other people and I think my backup plan, you know, I don't know anybody, um, it's really important that I do something with you tonight because I'm really, I know what the trigger is and it's Saturday night and I know I'm really weak right now and she didn't really respond, then at 8 in the morning she calls and wants me over there and it's like, I'm sorry, it's like, you want me to help you out, it's like I'm the one that's actually really in trouble and me volunteering for this [INAUDIBLE].  I have a sleep problem, I can't be there at 8 in the morning, you don't even know [INAUDIBLE].  She was totally [INAUDIBLE] actually the whole thing went fine.
<b>DR:</b>	She could have gone later.
<b>PT:</b>	At the time, I [INAUDIBLE] I woke up at 10:30, which I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Did you drink alone at home or you went out?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I only [INAUDIBLE], so that [INAUDIBLE] somewhere [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	So in this last week, how many times have you gone out?
<b>PT:</b>	Maybe 2, I don't know, I didn't leave the neighborhood at all.
<b>DR:</b>	And what are you thoughts on running a relationship, is that getting better?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's getting better.
<b>DR:</b>	So your heartbreak is—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	I see it, a lot of it [INAUDIBLE] with me being with lack of power, I don't know how to put balance in my life, I never have and it affects everything.  Now, he's got his own things but whatever.
<b>DR:</b>	It's very hard to get your sleep in shape with, uh, and your mood in shape with the alcohol use, how are we going to manage this.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, put it this way, last night I drank, um, 3 glasses of wine, spread out, and did all my exercises afterwards to help with my back and it just kept me up throughout the night, the anxiety, everything tightens up, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Hold on, stop a second, in the days after you stopped the Seroquel, right, you took Seroquel 3 days—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	And then those next 3 days, what was your sleep like?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, it was like what it was when I first, um, you know, the problems that I had originally, it was back to the normal problems.
<b>DR:</b>	Which you couldn't sleep at all.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that was—
<b>DR:</b>	So did you sleep those other 3 nights?
<b>PT:</b>	So off schedule for so long, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	But on an average, how many hours of sleep do you get?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, because I don't have to, have to really do anything, I'm trying to make sure that I'm still getting 8 hours.
<b>DR:</b>	But not more, you shouldn't get more than 8, you know that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You've got to get yourself out of bed.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm exercising, I've been exercising every day, I've been real good about that, um, [INAUDIBLE] and other things will fall into place and I have to address them eventually which will kind of balance my life.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, no, you know, in the priority of issues—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Alcohol use is up there because it gets in the way and you're using it despite knowing that it gets in the way, that means you've got a real control of alcohol use.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, last night it was like, it was like, I'm not going to sleep if I've got these knots in my back.
<b>DR:</b>	Whether you, whether you, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	But—
<b>DR:</b>	Feel like you're on top of it or not—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Is irrelevant to me.  I know it's giving you serious psychiatric problems when you drink anyway, that means you don't have the control, I'm not saying you're an alcoholic but you, you need—
<b>PT:</b>	But we know I'm an alcoholic.
<b>DR:</b>	You don't have the control you need to have.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm at a better level than I was before.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay and so in the kind of, um—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Harm reduction [INAUDIBLE], in the harm reduction—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Let's get you [INAUDIBLE] hit you on the head and bring you into the hospital and get you—
<b>PT:</b>	No, you know why—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I'm ready for it because last night I drank that, okay, and it [INAUDIBLE], um, and it didn't help me at all, I'm like—
<b>DR:</b>	But it sets you back as far as us getting traction with your mood problems.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And your sleep problems, it sets up back, I promise you, it sets us back.  If you want to drink, let's, you know, drink later but now we've got to get your mood, we've got to get your brain back in the game.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	This is a very important moment in your life, in, you know, you have the job, you maintain the job for a nice long time, you're on the cusp of losing it if you don't make it back, right?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe not but I don't know how many leaves of absence they can give you without saying, she's disabled.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I 'm definitely going back in 3 weeks, I'm definitely going back after [INAUDIBLE] by October.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Because the anxiety level—
<b>DR:</b>	That's yet, that's yet, all right, so listen, it is an important moment for us to get your brain in the right place and the alcohol sets us back.  If you cannot stop drinking—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Keep it to a very low level, you know, alcohol is a depressant and it gives us trouble but it may not give us trouble at a low level.  At high levels, it definitely is going to give us trouble.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe a low level we can, again, I don't, I'm not [INAUDIBLE] so I almost don't care that much—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	I care about your depression and your sleep—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And your dysfunction and for that reason only—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	This [INAUDIBLE], I don't need the alcohol on board.
<b>PT:</b>	You know what, um, there was something like Ambien [INAUDIBLE] called Ambien to try and get me back on a regular sleep schedule and alcohol is not allowed in the house if I go out and have a date and I have a glass, maybe 2, and that's fine, um, it's not in the house [INAUDIBLE] so I think—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, the two things I don't like—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Are these, one and maybe two, [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it's hard to do like, now like—
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] bottle and you're like, oh God.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, let them drink the extra glass.
<b>PT:</b>	And I did last time, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, well limit it to one and—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm just being honest.
<b>DR:</b>	And I don't like Klonopin or Ambien on board when you're drinking, it gives you amnesia, it makes you blackout, it makes you slur and, you know, it really—
<b>PT:</b>	So one glass is okay, socially, not anything [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well, let's keep talking, um, do you have any interest or willingness to take interviews or [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], you know, because I don't feel like, I'm not [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	You use it for muscle aches.
<b>PT:</b>	Not like it was before.
<b>DR:</b>	You use it for muscle aches?
<b>PT:</b>	Muscle aches or, um, like having stayed in for 3 days, um, [INAUDIBLE] anxiety worry about that, I'm saying, I mean I knew I was in a really, it used to help but it was—
<b>DR:</b>	Do you want to trade the Effexor for something different?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm a little scared.  I do down the road but I'm a little scared, [INAUDIBLE] down the road to start [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	So your point is you could be much more miserable than you are now?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I don't want to go to a major depressive episode.
<b>DR:</b>	You don't think you're in one now?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You've been worse.
<b>PT:</b>	But I—
<b>DR:</b>	You've been worse.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, I mean there's that, there's the day this week I that I though, you know, but no.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're still in the game.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Miserable as you are, you're still in the game.
<b>PT:</b>	This is not a major, no, I'm not in a major depressive episode.
<b>DR:</b>	How about this, I'll agree to help, let's do an experiment, a 2 week experiment, okay, I'll see you again in 2 weeks, a 2 week experiment of aggressively getting you on to schedule, which means both stimulants during the day and sleep medicine at night—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And no alcohol.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Aggressive, aggressive, getting you onto schedule.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But you've got to meet me halfway, it means no napping, you have to be brutally rigorous with the clock.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You're out of bed before 9 a.m.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	This is especially important as the days get shorter.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That sets off bad mood.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Aggressive with the clock and—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, when you wake up at 6 and it's dark at 7 now, it's like—
<b>DR:</b>	And no alcohol, give me 2 weeks, no alcohol.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Can we go one week at a time and I could see you next week.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm not here next week but, uh, we can talk on the phone.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	Obviously, we're doing one day at a time, even though I'm saying 2 weeks, we're doing one day, you've got to get through tomorrow.  Um, we can do one week at a time but I want a commitment, can you commit one week without alcohol.
<b>PT:</b>	I have a date on Tuesday, can I have a glass of wine on the date?
<b>DR:</b>	One glass.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But the Klonopin, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	Which is the worst of all of them adding to the alcohol?
<b>DR:</b>	They do the same thing, they go to the GABA system and they multiple each other.
<b>PT:</b>	Because they never, I mean I didn't have alcoholism, you know, I went on all this medication, I didn't have it before, so it's like which is worse.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I wonder if the Effexor gets you [INAUDIBLE] with alcohol.  The only one you're still on is the Effexor though.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah but that's, I know there's withdraw from Effexor.
<b>DR:</b>	You know what we could trade for—
<b>PT:</b>	A major depressive—
<b>DR:</b>	There's a new, there's a like son of Effexor called Pristiq.
<b>PT:</b>	Kind of like son of Sam.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] Effexor has what we call an active metabolite, meaning you take Effexor—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Then Venlafaxine, it goes to the liver—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	And there is a chemical metabolite of Venlafaxine.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Desvenlafaxine.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	And Desvenlafaxine is also active, Pristiq is Desvenlafaxine, it's the first metabolite of Venlafaxine, of Effexor—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're on it now, you're on Desvenlafaxine—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Plus Venlafaxine, you're on both, you're on 2 medicines.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What they do, what they claim to do with the Pristiq, the Desvenlafaxine is really get rid of the parent company, the Venlafaxine—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Rather than, so you have the second product.  It turns, and you know their claim, obviously, they have drug company issues, right, they want a new drug—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	With, you know, the long [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So you always have to be suspect about it but, and you know of course their main competition was somebody wen to far with the dosing, the dosing on Lexapro is the effective dose is the first or second dose—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	With Effexor it was always, it takes a month to get people up to the effect dosage.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Here with Pristiq there's only 1 or 2 doses.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	So again, there's also that competitive issue with drug companies, they say, oh that, it's pretty good, I've taken a couple people from Effexor to Desvenlafaxine and they're doing better and so, and I don't know why, I don't know why.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But their claim is that more of the side effects are from the first one, I don't know, I don't know why.
<b>PT:</b>	It sounds like—
<b>DR:</b>	But it's kind of the—
<b>PT:</b>	That's going to be better for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it's the baby step on getting you off, it's kind of—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	The half reduction and seeing whether a different version of Venlafaxine might be better for your brain.  We know your brain likes Venlafaxine—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	It's done nicely with it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Here's a different spin on it that may be better.  I've seen it be better with fewer side effects—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But it's just better efficacy and I saw it in 2 patients already so—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Most people do not like drinking with Venlafaxine on board, it's not a—
<b>PT:</b>	It makes me a real [INAUDIBLE], that's why [INAUDIBLE] and he was taking 37.5 and I'm like, oh my God, I'm taking 450 mg [INAUDIBLE], he's like, oh my God, I think she's such a lightweight.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	So it certainly interacts with the alcohol system.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And maybe that's what I'm getting at and maybe, I want to make sure I'm not [INAUDIBLE] to this, you know, maybe I'm making you a little manic and you're drinking down the mania, I don't know but I, you know, you can always go back.  Why don't we save this option for after we can reschedule—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, let's get the sleep schedule thing on and all that and—
<b>DR:</b>	Now what stimulant have you ever been on?
<b>PT:</b>	Once you gave me one and—
<b>DR:</b>	Provigil.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, Provigil, that had me just talking away.
<b>DR:</b>	You were [INAUDIBLE].  All right, the vagus kind of stimulant is Ritalin, we'll use Ritalin, [INAUDIBLE] doses, you know, a dose for a kid who has ADD or for someone who needs stimulant—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Is somewhere between 10 and 50 mg.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	We'll give you the 5, in the beginning you'll break them in half.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	You're going to use it, do you drink coffee?
<b>PT:</b>	I have—
<b>DR:</b>	Or caffeine?
<b>PT:</b>	I have, I drink decaf coffee and I have one cup in the morning.
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	After 12—
<b>DR:</b>	You need to do whatever it takes—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	To stay away, to get up in the morning, stay awake and not nap.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Whatever it takes.  If you have to reduce your morning Klonopin, we'll do that also, whatever it takes, you must, over this next week, let's say—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Get your schedule back.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Currently, what time do you go to sleep?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] 2.
<b>DR:</b>	It's gone back then.
<b>PT:</b>	It's definitely better than it was, I mean while I was working, I was going to bed, some nights I wouldn't even go, I'd go to be around 6.
<b>DR:</b>	Your brain can't seem to handle that, so let's get the meds on board at 9 or 10.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	If you're going to bed at 12, you know, 12, I should say, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I'm getting in the bed, it doesn't mean—
<b>DR:</b>	How long does it take—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm sleeping.
<b>DR:</b>	To fall asleep.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, the first one, now I remember, the first night I was without the Seroquel, okay, I was in bed at 12, that's great and I read for 3 hours about the Islamic culture, women and men which [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	With Seroquel on board?  With Seroquel on board?
<b>PT:</b>	No, without it and at 3:00, [INAUDIBLE], you know—
<b>DR:</b>	But with Seroquel, Seroquel was a sledgehammer, right.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, but this is the night that I didn't see you.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, of course, you [INAUDIBLE] time.  You took 50 and then half of 50 and then—
<b>PT:</b>	A quarter.
<b>DR:</b>	A quarter of 50.
<b>PT:</b>	A quarter, not even, really small.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe if you took a quarter of a 25.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Because if you claim that you just need something but not the [INAUDIBLE] we've got to find something.
<b>PT:</b>	Now why do you feel more certainly about this than about Ambien?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I'll give you both but, uh, for the long term this is far safer, especially since you're drinking and if you do decide to go back to alcohol, I don't want you taking, you have to convince me not to take any Ambien.  You can't drink with the Ambien.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	So if you're drinking—
<b>PT:</b>	I don't usually drink with the Seroquel either, [INAUDIBLE] no alcohol.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah but you did it before.  I mean they say that [INAUDIBLE].  Another drug company that gives you Seroquel, recently came out with this XR, so since they started marking for this, we don't get samples for the other which is a shame because it's a really nice—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I remember Ambien [INAUDIBLE] terrible—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Everybody takes that, everybody in my office takes it, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] All right, well you're in luck that I don't have any 25's to give you so you're stuck with just the Ambien.
<b>PT:</b>	Should I get a prescription for it?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it'll be up to you.  We kind of, to be honest, I don't think you have much sleep problem.
<b>PT:</b>	I just have to get back—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think you have a sleep phase problem.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] definitely but what, yeah—
<b>DR:</b>	So why don't we, uh, why don't we just use Ambien.  All right, so—
<b>PT:</b>	Even though the Seroquel helps with the anxiety and mood swings?
<b>DR:</b>	Does it?  You didn't tell me that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I did—
<b>DR:</b>	I told you that.
<b>PT:</b>	You told me that—
<b>DR:</b>	I told you that was the hope.
<b>PT:</b>	And then you asked me, how was your mood when you got up and I said it was good.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so you think it may have helped a touch?
<b>PT:</b>	It did.
<b>DR:</b>	And it does, to be honest, it does wear off, the sedating effect wears off, otherwise, obviously, no one would ever take it because, you know, I mean it's overwhelming, the sedation is overwhelming, it does wear off.  So to that end, just to have some around, I'll write for the 25s—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	When you're ready, it doesn't have to be this week or two, remember we have one goal at a time, this week or two, no drinking, sleep phase on line.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Ignore your mood, ignore going out, ignore everything else, you can't do everything at once, just no alcohol and get your sleep phase back set.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, going out, doing that helps me [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well but then you drink and you also get—
<b>PT:</b>	No, my kitchen is at home.
<b>DR:</b>	Get yourself a little demoralized when you set your sights too high.  Go out if you can but if you can't, don't consider it a failure.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, go out if you can, if you can't, you won't.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, so I'm writing Seroquel 25 mg, I'll write that you take 3 a day but, obviously, you'll take and really get it small—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	For round one, get it, a quarter of one, they're really tiny though, you know, I could write for the liquid, I think it may come as a liquid.  Do you have good insurance?
<b>PT:</b>	Aetna.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean for medicine.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I know what the copay is, this year it went up to 30.
<b>DR:</b>	Let me see if it comes as, all right, well whatever it comes in, you will try to get 5 mg—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Equivalent, so on the 25 mg tab, that's about a fifth.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Just a crumb but then you can work your way up.
<b>PT:</b>	Now if I wake up in the middle of the night or something due to either back knots, you know, something like that, can I then take like half an Ambien, can I mix these two?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, with this you can.  You ever use Sonata?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, no.
<b>DR:</b>	Sonata is the one that has the shortest half life, so if you wake up, that's the one that's the easiest to get you back to sleep.  You never used Sonata at all, why don't we use Sonata.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't remember but Ambien, I found if woke then I took it and went back to sleep, I mean in the past—
<b>DR:</b>	And you weren't groggy the next day?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	All right, so then—
<b>PT:</b>	There's one, I don't remember the name of it, that I brought up to you and you poo poo'd it, it was something, you said it was sort of like taking it all the time.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, oh yeah, yeah, that was, uh, Rozerem.
<b>PT:</b>	All right, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It looks like it does not come in liquid.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	The smallest is 25.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I'll ask them if they can cut it up for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, you have a good pharmacy?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I could ask them, they're great.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, I'll write for Ambien.
<b>PT:</b>	Now is there anything more I can do to address my anxiety?  Aside from changing my mindset?
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	I have to get [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Let's give it time, let's do these first 2 things first.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Ignore the mood, just ignore it, act like it's not there.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you have breathing exercises, I mean do you have things to do to manage anxiety?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, not enough, I need to learn.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, learn some, learn some more.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just that I end up with these physical—
<b>DR:</b>	What do you mean?
<b>PT:</b>	These intense knots in my back and stuff like that which, of course, totally destroys your sleep.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, all right, Ambien, Seroquel, do you need Klonopin also?  1 mg twice a day?
<b>PT:</b>	Can you write it down 1 mg 3 times a day, I think, just so I can get—
<b>DR:</b>	But don't overuse it, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  You said you would never want me to take more than 2 mg, right?
<b>DR:</b>	Correct, but not with alcohol.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you need anything else?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, no.  Now if I'm feeling really anxious at night—
<b>DR:</b>	Hold on, I'm going to give you Ritalin.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You must be awake during the day.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	No naps.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm still taking 1 Klonopin in the morning but I'm also taking Ritalin?
<b>DR:</b>	Correct but you're going to find your Ritalin dose, anywhere from 1/2 a pill to 2 pills.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Find the dose that gives you juice—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Without making you anxious but you need juice and often that's why people are up at night, is that they're not charged or alert enough during the day.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	See you in 2 weeks.  Let me make these copies for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay and then I left an original one in there.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, this is the original, do you want the original?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I mean the original from my physician, just to show you [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Right, right, you want that.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that back, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, fine.  All right, come around here, she'll put your address and everything on this.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	And I'll make the copies.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], okay, good, I can be there in about, uh, I want to print out your thing, so I could be there in, uh, I don't know, about, okay 15 minutes, good.  All right, good, see you soon, bye.
