BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> You can't even go visit.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah you can't [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You cannot even go visit.
<b>CG:</b> You're not going.
<b>PT:</b> But what about, that's not fair.  Come on.
<b>DR:</b> Well if you keep hitting your mother, I might have to reconsider.
<b>PT:</b> You are mean.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING], yeah I know.  I hear that all the time, you paying attention in school?
<b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> You doing your homework?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes?  Mom has to remind you a few times?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes?
<b>CG:</b> I have to remind him of everything.  I mean he can't, he has no initiative to do anything other than what he wants to do.
<b>DR:</b> Which is what?
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] and things he plays with outside, likes to play his videogames, um, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> How does he do that?
<b>CG:</b> Just you know, if you have somebody over to the house, he just tries to ignore everyone around [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I do not call them names.
<b>CG:</b> Well you call them ugly names, [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> No they call me ugly names.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You sleeping okay at night?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Hard to get any sleep?
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Since when?
<b>CG:</b> Um, I say it was the last time we came.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I'm not sleeping as well and you're waking up [INAUDIBLE] to aren't you?  I think, I think that's one of the biggest problems, is he wakes up.  He'll usually fall asleep but then he'll wake up.
<b>DR:</b> About what time?
<b>CG:</b> I wouldn't say every night.  [INAUDIBLE] you know half.
<b>DR:</b> Like what time though?
<b>CG:</b> What time of the night?  I think it's like -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, I want to say like early morning, like maybe 1:00 or 2:00 AM.
<b>DR:</b> Up for how long?
<b>CG:</b> What he usually turns on the TV, I don't really know how long; because I'm not up the whole time.
<b>PT:</b> I am.
<b>CG:</b> How long are you up maybe?
<b>PT:</b> Like uh -
<b>CG:</b> I don't think he really knows.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> But then by the time he, it's 6:30 or so and it's time for him to get.  It's almost impossible to get him up.
<b>DR:</b> How many nights a week would he be waking up would you think?
<b>CG:</b> Um, maybe three, three or four.
<b>DR:</b> Has he been late for school?
<b>CG:</b> No he's not late.  But it's a battle getting him there.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  You always take him?
<b>CG:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Once you get in him to school he get's out of the car and -
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum, oh yeah he's fine [INAUDIBLE] go on.  He doesn't fuss or anything like that.  But [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You pick him up too.
<b>CG:</b> My mom picks him up.
<b>DR:</b> How's that going with her after school?
<b>CG:</b> It's going better I think.
<b>DR:</b> It is?
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Do you do your homework right away?
<b>CG:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um.
<b>CG:</b> He doesn't usually do his homework until I get home and that's usually 6:00.
<b>DR:</b> Save it for you, huh?
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum, of course.
<b>PT:</b> But I don't know how to do it.
<b>CG:</b> But he really doesn't, I mean he has [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>CG:</b> So that's really not a big deal, I would say.
<b>DR:</b> Is he going to be in the same school next year?
<b>CG:</b> I just worry about you know, I'm sure they're passing him right on through.  But I'm worried about you know, what he's really learning.
<b>DR:</b> Did you do the standardize testing this year?
<b>CG:</b> Um, I think they're getting ready to do some more testing this month -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> Later this month.
<b>DR:</b> Well that'll be what we look at then.  What about accommodations for next year?
<b>CG:</b> We have an IEP coming up.  We had one last week but I couldn't make it so we had to reschedule.  So, I'm not sure when it is but we, we've got one coming up.  But the fifth grade teachers are not great.  He had a really good teacher this year, last year he had a terrible [INAUDIBLE] so I don't know what's going to happen next year.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you're going to have some say in that aren't you?
<b>CG:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah it's just the way, I wouldn't say any of them are really good for [PATIENT NAME].  You know they might be great for other kids but for [PATIENT NAME] I'm not sure.
<b>DR:</b> That's what we're looking at.
<b>PT:</b> I ain't going to no retarded class all day long.
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well, good.
<b>CG:</b> He, since we where here last time we had an IEP and he goes to um, in a self-contained class just for like 30 minutes a day.  He's doing resource for reading -
<b>PT:</b> But I'm going down [INAUDIBLE] one of them brains.
<b>CG:</b> Well he's fusing about it now but when he calms down and talks to me about it.  I think he is learning and he really, I think appreciates that because he, he feels better about himself because he's learning more and it's not you know it's just a few minutes a day.  But it's something so I mean, he would just die if we walked in and with those kids all the time.
<b>DR:</b> How, so how long is he in there everyday?
<b>CG:</b> Uh, maybe about 30 minutes and then he's in resource for 2 hours a day.
<b>DR:</b> Something wrong with your toe?
<b>CG:</b> He really needs, I think more specialized attention like that but of course he, I mean where he goes to school like he could, there he's the only white child in that um, self contained class.
<b>PT:</b> In [NAME OTHER]'s class I'm not.
<b>CG:</b> Well that's resource though, [NAME OTHER] too, aren't you?  Didn't you tell me you where the only white child?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>CG:</b> And those children look different than he looks.  I don't know what their problems are but he -
<b>DR:</b> How many kids are in there?
<b>CG:</b> How many children are in there [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> About -
<b>CG:</b> Seven or eight?
<b>PT:</b> Ten or 11.
<b>CG:</b> Maybe 10.
<b>PT:</b> No I think it's more.
<b>CG:</b> I didn't think there were that many but -
<b>PT:</b> There is because they got some new [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> What are you doing [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> How was your weekend?
<b>CG:</b> Good, he went over to a friends and spent the night.  He had a good weekend.
<b>DR:</b> Is this the case with his time a lot?
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> How about medicines, how are we doing there?
<b>CG:</b> He's still taking the same and he's doing good.  He takes his medicines really well.  I don't have any trouble with that.  The only thing is just the bed wetting the DDABP, I cannot get him to take that.  The only time he will take that is if he's spending the night with a friend -
<b>DR:</b> Does it work then?
<b>PT:</b> Because it's so -
<b>CG:</b> It works then.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] and it melts in mouth and I don't like it taste and all that.
<b>CG:</b> But at home every night he wets the bed.  That is one battle we go through and it's such a simple solution if I could get him to take the medicine.
<b>DR:</b> How many is he take -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] all for you to drink.  Take me to the house and -
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> They make a spray, you want to spray it up your nose instead -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Taking a pill.
<b>CG:</b> Would you like to do that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Could use that instead.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I was thinking they make two different tablets too.
<b>CG:</b> This is like a white kind of a -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> Grainy tablet.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah it melts in my mouth and you're not supposed to swallow it, ya'll lied to me then.
<b>DR:</b> You are supposed to swallow it.
<b>CG:</b> You are supposed to swallow it, yeah you're supposed to swallow it.
<b>PT:</b> Then why does it melt in my mouth?
<b>DR:</b> Because you don't swallow it fast enough.
<b>CG:</b> I think, it's like rough and kind of grainy.  I don't I know -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and I can't swallow, yeah I can't swallow.
<b>CG:</b> Because like the um, Depakote is, is slick, you know -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> It's like uh, and then, um, Vistaril of capsules inserted like it's slick.  So those are easier for him to swallow I think.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and I can't, and I can't swallow it fast enough.
<b>CG:</b> The Risperdal is so tiny he doesn't have that much trouble with that.
<b>DR:</b> Any side effects from those medicines?
<b>CG:</b> He has trouble with his speech, like if he's trying to tell somebody something.  He will talk and stutter and I mean he just can't get it out some days and other days it's better.
<b>DR:</b> It's like he can't get it out fast enough you think?
<b>CG:</b> Or he can't get it out at all.  It's like he can't say what he wants to say.  He knows what he wants to say but he just can't articulate.  He's just you know, uh, an, uh, an, uh, uh.
<b>DR:</b> Now the, you're take the Concerta in the morning and then after lunch?
<b>PT:</b> And everybody tells me I sound like a nigger and I can't help it.
<b>DR:</b> Just once a day?
<b>CG:</b> Just once a day.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and then -
<b>CG:</b> Don't you say that word.
<b>DR:</b> And then when the medicine working is that problem just as common or is it less common?
<b>CG:</b> I think it's just as common.  I think it's just as common in the afternoon as it is in the morning.  I think that's why you try to talk like a black person sometimes because you can't get your words out and he's trying to be silly to cover up.
<b>PT:</b> No I just can't say it fast enough.
<b>CG:</b> Well you can't say, you can't get it out all sometimes.
<b>PT:</b> That's why I talk like a nigger.
<b>CG:</b> Quit saying that.
<b>PT:</b> What, I say it all the time.
<b>CG:</b> Well you don't say it in front of me.
<b>DR:</b> Do you say that, you say that at school?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>CG:</b> They would, they would kill him.  Would you say that at school?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So you don't say that all the time do you?
<b>CG:</b> Now he's just been kind of defiant like that lately, you know, just -
<b>PT:</b> I'm just so tired because I'm so depressed and nothing, we don't ever do nothing that's why.
<b>DR:</b> I thought you were going to build something here.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I got busy picking at my toenails.
<b>DR:</b> I see that.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You can pick your nail, toenails on the way home.
<b>CG:</b> Trash, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  What's the trash can for?  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> But that does concern me with his speech.  He's talking, I mean this is as good as it gets.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> But I mean, you know, sometimes he just can not get it out.
<b>DR:</b> And the Concerta doesn't seem to help that?
<b>CG:</b> Maybe, maybe that's why they [INAUDIBLE] this morning, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Because he took it?
<b>CG:</b> Might be more in the afternoon, you know more in the evening -
<b>DR:</b> In the afternoons and on the weekends you get the Concerta?
<b>CG:</b> He, he doesn't talk much at home.  You know you could ask him a question and he'll answer you but as far as carrying on a conversation and wanting to talk, he does very little of that.  Now, if he's got something on his mind, something's troubling him, sometimes he say "momma I want to talk about" you know, something and, and he'll, he'll talk to me.
<b>DR:</b> Really, wow that's maturity.
<b>CG:</b> He does, sometimes he'll say "I want to talk about something."
<b>DR:</b> That's great.  That's what you want to do [PATIENT NAME], you want to keep this, get this stuff out of your head.  The thing about kids with attention problems they, their thoughts go real fast and, and a lot of times they just uh, can't say it all.  You know, they can't speak as fast as they brains go and so they'll often stumble over they words.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Even, even adults.  I saw a young man earlier this morning he was say kind of the same thing.  He said that he feels like he's not getting everything out and not coming across like he wants too.
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But, he's says plenty.
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But he's, his idea is that he's not saying everything.
<b>CG:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> When he's on his medicine.
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Who is that that dude that just came in here?
<b>DR:</b> No, no this is another guy, but it is a bite of uh, it's not a notch in terms of what goes out and what can go out.
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> The speech seems pretty clear.
<b>CG:</b> Tod, this morning it does; but sometimes not at all.
<b>PT:</b> Often it isn't.
<b>DR:</b> But some, isn't it like he's just try to talk too fast?
<b>CG:</b> It's like he's stuttering.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> That's why I act -
<b>CG:</b> And it's um, um, um, um -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> All bad.
<b>DR:</b> That's what I think, I think it's him wanting to talk faster than he really can.
<b>CG:</b> I don't know, or it's like he's trying to process his thoughts or something -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>CG:</b> He's brain -
<b>PT:</b> I'm trying to talk but I can't talk.
<b>DR:</b> You're talking fine in here.
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I think, I think if you watch I think that you'll see that when the Concerta is working is, it'd be less, less likely a problem.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Just kind of look, watch that on the weekends -
<b>PT:</b> Because most of -
<b>DR:</b> After it's working -
<b>PT:</b> The time I'm pumped up -
<b>DR:</b> And after it wears off.
<b>PT:</b> On something.
<b>DR:</b> Like what?
<b>CG:</b> Well those energy drinks you -
<b>DR:</b> They make it worse?
<b>CG:</b> He [INAUDIBLE] well you know like a Coke or uh something like that he's fine but my mother the last like Thursday, Wednesday and Thursday she bought him these big energy drinks because that's what he wanted.
<b>PT:</b> They're good.
<b>CG:</b> Oh, my word.
<b>DR:</b> Doesn't she know how to say what's that word, no.
<b>CG:</b> She doesn't know that word, [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> She, she does, she does everything for me and [NAME OTHER].  She's the nicest person in the world.
<b>DR:</b> She is huh?
<b>PT:</b> Besides my daddy.
<b>CG:</b> Well you can't come in with those drinks.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING] .
<b>CG:</b> I thought Wednesday and Thursday I just "oh God."
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING] .
<b>PT:</b> It's not even the, the, the, the one that [INAUDIBLE] but it's not as strong.
<b>CG:</b> No you don't need to drink any of those drinks, no those drinks.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you can't have those; because tell her, tell her that it inner acts with his medicine and it'll run his blood pressure up or something.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Tell them not to do that.
<b>PT:</b> They're supposed to give you heart attacks too.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah is that what you're wanting?
<b>PT:</b> No, I just, they just good.
<b>DR:</b> They're not good for you.
<b>PT:</b> Said not to drink them or they'll give you a heart attack because that's what it said on the computer.  Because there's a man that drank a Red Bull everyday and he died from it.
<b>CG:</b> Whatever sissy says is true.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> And I can say it -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> And it would make no sense.
<b>PT:</b> No it was on the computer.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> He had a heart attack from drinking so much of it.
<b>DR:</b> Well who brought that up on the computer?  Did you find that?
<b>PT:</b> I went on the computer without her, no but I looked up the password in the yearbook and nobody knew about that and I didn't tell nobody.
<b>CG:</b> But she's the one who found that information, wasn't it her?  That she told you, you said "she told you."
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't know if she was telling me the truth because most of the time she won't tell me the truth because she don't, because she don't take her whatever it's called Prozac or something.
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING], we're all crazy in our house.
<b>PT:</b> Momma how come I talks okay some of the times but I can't some of the other times?
<b>CG:</b> I don't know baby that's what we were just talking about.  I think maybe you just don't focus and slow down.
<b>DR:</b> You think that might be part of it?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> What are you learning at school now?
<b>PT:</b> Nothing.  I want to learn, go ahead and learn about Stone Wall Jackson, but nobody else knows him.
<b>DR:</b> Nobody?
<b>PT:</b> Nope.
<b>DR:</b> Who was he?
<b>PT:</b> He was a general in the Confederate.
<b>DR:</b> And?
<b>PT:</b> He was commanded by Robert E Lee to uh, march uh, [INAUDIBLE] river, I think.  Something like that.
<b>DR:</b> Where did you learn that?
<b>PT:</b> On the game.
<b>DR:</b> On the what?
<b>PT:</b> On the game.
<b>DR:</b> What games that?
<b>PT:</b> And I got answers, interested in it.
<b>CG:</b> What game was that?
<b>PT:</b> That Civil War game I got.
<b>DR:</b> Is that a video game?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Yes, it is.  But I think you learned that at school.
<b>PT:</b> No I didn't.
<b>CG:</b> Because I remember seeing some paperwork, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, you want to see?
<b>CG:</b> No I believe you.
<b>PT:</b> He took 12 men on the [INAUDIBLE] and he was commanded by Robert E Lee and he got shot and, uh, what else, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Who shot him?
<b>PT:</b> I forgot, I don't know who shot him.
<b>DR:</b> Was it the enemy or one of his own men?
<b>PT:</b> No, I think it was uh, a um, Union.
<b>CG:</b> A what?
<b>PT:</b> A Union.
<b>DR:</b> Think so, wasn't one of his own men?
<b>PT:</b> Wait it didn't tell me that.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, is that his IEP you had out?
<b>CG:</b> Oh, no that's just -
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>CG:</b> Something.
<b>PT:</b> How come most of the kids don't like what happened in, how come I'm the only kid in my class interested in the Civil War?
<b>CG:</b> Well some, not everybody is interested in the same thing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, were you I'd think you be more interest in the Revolutionary War.
<b>PT:</b> Well the Revolutionary War is too boring.
<b>DR:</b> You'd read all about Swomfox.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's boring?
<b>PT:</b> He was a rich wasn't he, or [INAUDIBLE], shot I can't remember.
<b>DR:</b> Are you reading much with him at home or his he reading much on his own?
<b>PT:</b> I'm -
<b>CG:</b> No, not much.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I am.  I'm reading at school more than you know.  I'm reading 5th grade books.
<b>DR:</b> Are you?  You remembering any -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> We don't read a lot at home, we don't read like we should at home.
<b>DR:</b> Well you remembering what you've read?
<b>CG:</b> He does pretty good with that.
<b>PT:</b> All I read, all I read about is the Civil War.
<b>CG:</b> If he hears it or reads it he retains it and he can recall if you ask him questions.
<b>DR:</b> If he reads if silently?
<b>PT:</b> But it, but it's hard to remember.
<b>CG:</b> I don't know about silently; because if I told him to read something silently at home I don't think he would read it.
<b>PT:</b> I read like, I don't know -
<b>DR:</b> So when you say that if he hears it he's going to remember it.
<b>CG:</b> If he's reading and it could be, you know, like if we read a page here and then we stop for five minutes and he has to go to the bathroom, or get something to drink -
<b>PT:</b> I do have to go -
<b>CG:</b> We, we start back again and you know at the end of the story.  I'm like, I don't even know what happened.  But he can answer questions.  Now I don't know if they've read it in school -
<b>PT:</b> I don't because I'm always -
<b>CG:</b> So he remembers when he's in school.
<b>PT:</b> In dang [NAME OTHER]'s.
<b>CG:</b> But, um he does real well of retaining the information if he hears it or you know reads it.  Now silently I, I really don't know.
<b>PT:</b> I wish -
<b>CG:</b> And I think silently if he read it there would be so many words he may not know until -
<b>PT:</b> I wish I was born in a different time period.
<b>CG:</b> I wish we could put a chip in your brain and take you out of schools.  You would know everything you needed to know.
<b>PT:</b> I wish I was born in a different time period.
