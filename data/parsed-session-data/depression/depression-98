TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:
______________________________________________________________________________
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: Today is March 7th, 1994. 
PATIENT: ...clear as to what this was, the first session, or whether this was another interview.
COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.
PATIENT: So...
COUNSELOR: Yes, you thought it was an ongoing process that might be never-ending, right? Yeah.
PATIENT: So...
COUNSELOR: So here we are.
PATIENT: Here we are.
COUNSELOR: Why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself?
PATIENT: Well, I guess I was referred to this therapy group by Dr. Rodriguez, who was my therapist back, gosh, 12, 13 years ago, when I was in 12th grade, and I had seen him for about a year, and I basically kept in contact periodically, you know, just via postcards and stuff like that. And on two separate occasions I guess I was going through some hard time with my personal life so I gave him a call and he saw me. The last time was he saw me for about a month, once a week, and he felt that, you know, this may be beneficial to me and referred me here and so that's how I ended up coming here.
COUNSELOR: Right. So you worked with him just for a month that last time.
PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I met him once a week, met him four times. What I'm looking for is really - a lot of my problems, I know what they are. I guess I tend to be analytical of my own behaviors and things around me so I do know what the problems are, I just don't know what to do about them, you know. I guess what I'm looking for is more like some sort of guidance and direction as to what I can do or maybe point out the problems that I do have and that I may not recognize. 0:02:26.6
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: So...
COUNSELOR: What's your sense of what you'd like to work on?
PATIENT: Oh, lots.
COUNSELOR: Lots of things? Yeah.
PATIENT: Well, I mean it's not a lot actually, it's just very repetitious. You know, I seem to have the same problems over and over; has to do with self-confidence. What I'd like to come out of this is to be more assertive, not necessarily aggressive. I have a real hard time with asserting myself, at least the way I view myself. Other people think I'm very assertive, you know, but that's not the way I see myself. I have a tendency to feel victimized, and whether it's true or not it's just the way I perceive it, so I tend to think of myself that way and I'd like to get over that attitude, that feeling, you know.
COUNSELOR: Can you tell me a little bit more about that? When does that seem to happen for you? What's it like?
PATIENT: Most of my problems are with interpersonal relationships, personal relationships with the man that I'm with, and I think a lot of the times I allow myself to happen. I almost like initiate the pattern of how the relationship ought to be, but the pattern is - I'm not happy with the pattern, you know. I don't really make too many decisions in how the relationship should go. I tend to meet men who are either emotionally unavailable or who are afraid of relationships. 0:04:24.5
COUNSELOR: Is that true of the person you're with now?
PATIENT: To some extent. I'm engaged to this man, and when I was going through the interview session I was going through a phase where I wasn't sure whether I wanted to be with this man. He's a nice man as far as being a good person. He's a very good person. He has a lot of the qualities that I want in a person, which is honesty and fidelity, trust. You know, he hasn't shown me any reasons that I shouldn't trust him, you know, but at the same time he's also a man who, for one reason or another, doesn't want to settle down, doesn't want to get married, doesn't want to have any children.
COUNSELOR: So where does that leave you? 
PATIENT: Well, last night I came to the conclusion that I'm planning to stay with him, and I guess I came up with the decision on various levels, you know, on my personal needs, financial needs, and emotional needs, you know. The reason why I was going through this STAT (ph) was because I wasn't sure if I wanted to have any children, and for a long time I decided that I didn't want any children. And then I guess in the last six months or so the idea of wanting children is inside of me again, and I'm not sure whether I'm all of a sudden deciding that I want children because I don't want the relationship to work because I know he doesn't want kids... Because he is willing to marry. It is just that he definitely doesn't want any children so... 0:06:29.3
COUNSELOR: And you feel you do.
PATIENT: I think I do. See, that's the thing. I'm really not sure. Part of me has that need, you know, like taking care of another human being that totally depends on you. I guess I feel like that will make my life complete. I don't know if it is, you know, because what everyone says it is. You know, everyone says you have to be a mother, but then there's a part of me that is very, very scared of being responsible for another human being to that extent. I mean their whole life depends on you and that's very scary. And I'm not really happy with the way the world is right now with all the crime and lack of jobs and I'm not sure if I want to bring another human being into this life, you know? 
COUNSELOR: So one of the things you want to look at is being able to trust people and trust yourself I think I'm hearing. Is that correct, in terms of what you want and working with your husband, you know, developing your relationship?
PATIENT: Trust is very important to me, you know. Once that trust is not there I have a real hard time regaining that trust in that person, you know. I can often forgive people for the things they've done, but I can never forget for the things they've done, and I guess trust plays a major role in that. Once I found out that the person has lied to me, for whatever reasons - you know, it may be because they thought it was best or whatever - but it's now I start saying to myself, "Well, if he can lie about this what else has he lied to me about," and it's very hard for me to just forget and say, "Okay, let's start over." Yes, trust is very important, and that is - I would say that is... And fidelity, you know. Those are two of the most important qualities I look for in a mate, I guess. 0:08:47.6
COUNSELOR: How are you feeling, talking about this?
PATIENT: I'm a little nervous right now, you know. I guess going right into it it is a little bit unsettling.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. What else are you feeling?
PATIENT: I don't really have any problems opening up as far as my past or my problems. I just want to do it in the right way so that it's clear and understood by all parties involved, I guess.
COUNSELOR: Me too, right.
PATIENT: (Chuckling), yeah. So I'm just a little nervous and I know that the camera is on so it's like I'm kind of self conscious, you know.
COUNSELOR: Are you thinking about the camera?
PATIENT: A little bit, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's understandable.
PATIENT: Well, I guess it's going to take a little while.
COUNSELOR: So do you have a sense of what the nervousness is about?
PATIENT: Oh, I guess it's knowing that you're being studied, you know, that it's not... I guess just the fact that you know that you're being analyzed now and at a later point so it's just... And I want to be as natural as possible and not be like an actress or something so, you know... 
COUNSELOR: So it's important to be natural and to speak your mind and say what you need to say.
PATIENT: Yeah. You know, I have a real hard time with phony people so I don't want to be one of those, you know.
COUNSELOR: Phony people. 0:10:28.7
PATIENT: Yeah. I know that there are a lot of people out there who feel that they have to put up some sort of a faï¿½ade or a front. And for the most part I'm able to tell those kind of people and I know I don't like that as a quality so I try not to have those qualities in myself. I guess I'm a pretty hard critic of myself and of other people and I think that's one of the problems that I often have in relationships, the relationships that are close to me, because my expectations are high or maybe even unrealistic. I don't know. I don't know. I feel like I'm more - I would feel a little more comfortable if it was like a question-answer type of stuff, then I can just answer your questions, but I know it's not like that.
COUNSELOR: You feel that I'm really looking at you and studying you and sort of... I mean is that the sense that, you know, you have?
PATIENT: Well, like I had no problem filling out those questionnaires because they're just questions and answers.
COUNSELOR: And now the camera is trained on you, I'm trained on you, and you're on the hot seat.
PATIENT: Yeah. So I don't know. I mean I don't know where to start, you know. We can start at the very beginning. I don't know if we need to go that far.
COUNSELOR: Well, maybe we can start where you are right now with just feeling a little nervous and maybe full of questions about the process and who I am and what this is all about. I mean that's... 0:12:17.9
PATIENT: Well, what I was told was that there would be 30 interview sessions and that they would be filmed and it will later be analyzed by psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers, I guess in conjunction with my questionnaires after each session, and that it's an intense, short program, you know.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: So which I'm very happy about it, because I'm not really into that whole Freudian stuff, you know, the long, drawn-out, you know, lay-down-on-the-couch kind of stuff. You know, I studied a little bit of psychology so I may be like a little cynical at times, so a little knowledge is a dangerous thing so...
COUNSELOR: Will you have any questions you'd like to ask about it or things that you're thinking about right now?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was just a little surprised that we just went like right into it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, what did that feel like, going right into it? 
PATIENT: I didn't feel prepared. You know, I mean I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be prepared about, but I didn't feel ready, you know.
COUNSELOR: Felt kind of swift, huh?
PATIENT: (Chuckling). Like changing gears almost, you know?
COUNSELOR: So you felt that just happened quickly and we were into the heart of it and yeah...
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I asked you about yourself and you started to talk about your relationship.
PATIENT: Right into it.
COUNSELOR: You went right into it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And I guess I stayed with you there. But you know, you were bringing it up, sort of your relationship. 
PATIENT: I guess - I don't know. I feel maybe that's what you were looking for, you know, since that this is what it is all about, so I just went right into it but... 0:14:36.5
COUNSELOR: Well, the way... I mean maybe it would be good at this point to talk a little bit about the way this therapy works.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: One of the things that this therapy is about is really sort of staying close to one's feelings and one's experience and working with that, and a lot of times how you feel is very sort of indicative of your state and things that you might want to talk about. 
Another thing that we'll look at is the patterns in your life and the way in which sometimes one repeats negative patterns and what is actually happening in that regard and sort of look at that and try to bring it, as much as possible, into the room to talk about it in the here and now. And in some ways sometimes what is happening sort of in your outside life can take place here too, because of your having a relationship with me, and that might have parallels to what you're experiencing outside so we use it sort of as a laboratory. 
And you know, we'll see how it goes, but the focus is really sort of to try to stay in the experience and to look at what is happening in your life and see what it is about.
PATIENT: That sounds fine, you know. I was just thinking, the minute I saw you I just - you just reminded me of this actress, and as I'm sitting here, I'm sorry, I'm...
COUNSELOR: That's okay. I hope I like who it is.
PATIENT: Umm...
COUNSELOR: You can't remember.
PATIENT: I can't remember her name, but just physical appearance you just seem very much like her. 0:16:24.3
COUNSELOR: So you know, you're getting to know me. You're having, you know...
PATIENT: I guess I'm a little nervous and I have a hard time like looking at - constant eye contact. I mean I know it's rude to stare away so...
COUNSELOR: Am I sort of looking at you too much? Are you feeling like I'm really looking at you, as I am right now? Are you feeling observed a little bit?
PATIENT: Not really, no, because I guess I've learned that eye contact is important. Just that at times when it does get a little intense, you know, I have a tendency to come and look away, especially if I'm thinking, you know, I stare at a blank space or something.
COUNSELOR: Right, right. So maybe it feels a little intense right now.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, I think so, I think so, a little bit.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Can you explore that a bit? I mean this is...
PATIENT: I think I'm just the way I am when all the attention is focused on me. I feel very self-conscious. It's not just in this type of setting, but even in other aspects of my family life. Everyone has like a place. My sister is usually the attention getter. I'm more - I'm vocal. I mean that's not to say that I'm passive. I feel very uncomfortable when all the attention is on me. 0:18:14.8
COUNSELOR: Do you feel it physically right now? Do you have any sort of physical sense of what...
PATIENT: Well, my breathing isn't as fluid. You know, I feel like I'm kind of holding my breath a little bit and I have that need to take a deep breath every once in a while. But I guess it's not as bad as I thought it might be.
COUNSELOR: What did you picture?
PATIENT: Well, you know, the camera on you and everything. I don't know. I thought maybe I would just not be able to say anything. But I get used to situations fairly quickly so I don't think this will be an every-session situation.
COUNSELOR: Well, do you have some concerns that you're supposed to be a certain way here? I'm wondering if you feel you're supposed to be more relaxed than you are.
PATIENT: Yes, I guess that I'm - I guess I'm relating to the way I am with Dr. Rodriguez where I've known him for a long time and so I can just go into his office, I can sit anywhere I want and...
COUNSELOR: And the first thing I said to you is "wrong chair." Yeah, right, right. Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm okay though, really, I am. I'm just a little more comfortable with a question-answer type of an interview than I am with just coming up with something off the top of my head. 
COUNSELOR: What did you want me to ask you? Did you have anything in mind? 0:20:03.9
PATIENT: No. Just anything... I guess the type of questions that would draw out, you know, what my problems may be or what I want to focus on or something like that. I mean not a direct question, you know, as to yes or no type of an answer, but more like a question that would give me - I don't know. It is like - it doesn't look like - I'm just kind of lost, telling you everything about my - you know?
COUNSELOR: Yes, yes.
PATIENT: So...
COUNSELOR: Well, maybe you're feeling some... I don't know, but maybe you're feeling some reluctance to talk, and would it be helpful if I asked you questions? Would that be helpful for you right now?
PATIENT: Probably, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Probably, huh?
PATIENT: Probably, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Less than probably though. Maybe yes...
PATIENT: Well, because - no, because I don't really have problems talking. One of the things I think I've realized, you know, for a long time I wanted to be a therapist, and one of the reasons why I wanted to do that was because I've always enjoyed being able to help another person, you know, problem that may have been similar to mine and somehow give them some sort of guidance, you know. And when I was younger and I played that role and all of the people have always told me that I've helped them, and that made me feel very good. And then over the years, as I got older, I began understanding a little bit more of myself and my personality and I have a tendency to get really frustrated easily and lose - get very impatient. 0:22:00.8 
So now I'm realizing that listening to other people talking about their problems isn't like one of the things I'm really interested in doing. It's like I'm like everyone else who wants to talk about their problems, you know? Everyone is like really selfish in that sense. It's like you don't normally see two people having a conversation too much; it's always one person says, "Oh, I'm going through this," and then another person, "Oh, well, you think that's bad, you know, wait until you hear what I went through," and I find that a lot in my adult...
COUNSELOR: Some people aren't listening to each other?
PATIENT: No. I find that they don't really listen at all, they just want to talk about theirself (sic), and I'm not that much different I guess, you know. I mean I see that as a negative quality, I don't see that as a positive quality, but unfortunately that's one of the qualities that I'm finding out about myself. I'm learning. I'm trying to learn to be a better listener to a friend and not feel that a story has to be compared to my own experience. But yeah, I don't have any problems talking about myself, unfortunately.
COUNSELOR: What would you like me to know about you? 
PATIENT: I guess anything that I think that may be relevant to my repetitive patterns, you know, but I'm not sure if everything I talk about is relevant to that, you know. I mean like there are definite things that I like to learn more about myself, you know. Whys would be nice, why I am the way I am would be nice, but more in terms of what I can do with that information to make the changes that I want to change. 0:24:08.5 
So there isn't anything that I can tell you. I wanted to know about A, B and C. I guess in talking hopefully I can reveal enough about myself to kind of get an idea of what kind of person I am and...
COUNSELOR: So you know the first thing we really talked about was trusting, who you can trust, and I think that you were talking about it in relation to your fiancï¿½, but I think it's really sort of apropos here, and maybe that was really quick to sort of get into that. And I'm wondering how you felt about talking about that so quickly, the issue of trust.
PATIENT: Trust; I guess I have no reason not to trust you. I have no reason to believe that this clinic would do anything negative with the information that's being discussed. So I didn't come in with the preconceived ideas that the information is going to be misused and that's usually the way I am with people. When I meet people I have no reason not to trust them. It's usually - I mean there may be a part of me that has this wall up, you know, a self-protective wall where I don't want them to hurt me so that if they do do something that's harmful to me it doesn't affect me as much, you know. But I think trust is something that I've never really had, you know. 0:26:08.5
COUNSELOR: What makes you say that?
PATIENT: I mean there are a lot of different levels of trust, you know. I think as a young child the first thing that you trust is your parents, you know, and when things don't go well... And then this is after... I mean a lot of times I come up with answers only because - and I go back to my childhood, and this I do on my own, because I don't have any answers to the present situation, because I always think that the way you are now is partially of who you are as a person. But mostly you are made up of who you have been, who you have been influenced by. 
So you know, from the time I was a young child I mean the people that you trusted, that you put your whole life, your faith in, whether they meant to or not, desert you. That's just - that connection isn't there any more and the fear of... I think a lot of my insecurities and not being able to put my whole faith in someone else, because I can't. Not that I can't, but consciously I think I do, but it always turns out that it doesn't work out like that, you know. Do you understand what I'm saying?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, I do. I'm wondering what it feels like, saying this? Do you have any sense of how you're feeling as you're talking about it?
PATIENT: I guess as you talk there's always a memory so you are - I'm relating to us probably some incidences that make me believe what I'm saying, and oftentimes it's a sad situation so... You feel a little bit of sadness, you know. A lot of pondering as to why or - not so much "why me." I try not to have self pity, but the question of why does come up and what if it maybe hadn't been that way, you know, how would I be now? I would be a very different person. 0:28:47.3
So I don't know. I mean I guess I'm conscious - right now I'm very self conscious of what I'm saying because I don't want to sound pompous, you know. Maybe that's not the right word, but I don't want to sound like I've analyzed it all and like this is my answer, but this is something that I've gone through for many years and I...
COUNSELOR: I'm just curious, maybe you can tell me a little bit more. I don't know quite what you mean when you say you don't want to sound pompous about talking...
PATIENT: Like a lot of the times when people talk it's not a natural sounding. People have a tendency to sound very analytical, very organized or very controlled, you know, and I think when - a lot of times when people talk like that, when they're not natural, I know my antenna goes up, you know. When I talk to people they sound so technical or so sure of what they're saying. I'm saying, "He can't be for real." And I know that since I've been in business I've become more and more - I sound like that. You know, when I was...
COUNSELOR: Sound what? More like... 0:30:20.9
PATIENT: More removed from - more controlled in what I'm saying, like it's been practiced or something, you know. Like too business-like, that kind of stuff.
COUNSELOR: Like you've become detached from the feeling.
PATIENT: Yes. Almost like I'm looking at it from a distance and say, you know, I'm reviewing a movie or something; no emotion behind it. I don't ever want to be left (ph) in the situation.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. So I think by you telling me, that you want me to know that you feel deeply about these things.
PATIENT: I'm telling you that because I'm listening to myself talk and I'm sounding like that, at least I think I'm sounding like that a little bit, and I don't like it. I don't want to sound like that. I mean I don't want to talk in that way. I don't want to intellectualize and analyze in that sense.
COUNSELOR: So do you do this a lot, where you listen to yourself speaking?
PATIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: And critique it as you're speaking?
PATIENT: Yes, I do, especially... I mean I don't do that with my friends, because when I'm with my friends I'm very different. I'm a lot more relaxed and just a lot more - I guess a lot more animate, but in business this is why... And I said that because I caught myself, oh, feeling that way and I'm also really very nervous. Like I can feel myself sweating. This room was very cold the last time I was here so I kind of put on something warm and it's kind of warm today. Is it warm or is it just me?
COUNSELOR: Well, it's not cold, that's for sure. 0:32:17.0
PATIENT: Okay. 
COUNSELOR: It's sort of, yeah, on the warm side, I think. This room changes a bit. Sometimes it's nippy and sometimes it's sort of hot actually, and it's on the warm side for me.
PATIENT: Okay, so it's not me then.
COUNSELOR: No. I feel it too a little bit.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Well, I think you were talking about important things and this is a new situation and I'm new and I'm new to you and you're new to me and I think that's sort of in the foreground right now.
PATIENT: I think talking to somebody who you don't know, you know, I think is often helpful. Because one time I had a conversation with this person, this man, I was on a seven-hour bus trip, you know, and it was just much easier to talk to a total stranger, knowing that you will never see this person again. You know, not that I will never see you again, because I will, but there isn't that intimacy. There isn't the everyday contact. So in that sense it's a lot easier to be more open and honest. I mean this is not something I would tell people, you know, like that I analyze myself and listen to myself talk. 0:33:51.1
But one of the things that I promised that I would do is that I would be totally truthful and honest in this session, because even though I'd been in therapy before this there's always been some information that was left out for one reason or another and it's probably because I felt shamed or ashamed in the sense like that I would think that someone else would say or think "I can't believe she's done that" or "I can't believe she's felt that" or you know. 
What I want is I want to really feel like I am - not cured, because I don't think I'm sick, you know, but really I guess more healthy in my outlook in life, because I have a tendency to be very low-keyed and depressive; not necessarily depressed but depressive.
COUNSELOR: Well, you also said you wanted to be more assertive.
PATIENT: Yes, that's one of the things I would like to learn, because I think right now is I'm aggressive, I'm not assertive.
COUNSELOR: How does that manifest?
PATIENT: I don't think I've learned the... See, when I came to this country I was brought up very traditionally, you know. I was young, but you learn at a very young age of your role and how you're supposed to play that role, and I was taught that a woman's place was beneath the man's and that you really have no position in life. You know, that you're whole like was geared towards having a family and making your husband happy and that's really about it. 
Coming to this country I've learned, by hearing and seeing, that women can have a place in life, not to the extent that a man does still, because even though we've become a lot more modern women still don't have the equal opportunities and rights, unfortunately. 
But in trying to achieve that independence I think I've learned to become aggressive, but never learned the proper way to assert myself and... 0:36:29.8
COUNSELOR: Which is... What's your idea about it?
PATIENT: I believe in equality in the sense of if my brain works just as well as your brain and you're a man, then my position in any job place or home place, whatever, should be equal. There shouldn't be - I shouldn't have to learn about a woman getting paid 70 cents for every dollar that a man makes. I shouldn't have to learn that a woman works eight, ten hours a day, and still has to come home and cook, clean, and do laundry.
Because now I have that information, what I'd like to do is to take that information and say, "This is my right, and you, as my partner, I would like this to be split this way or that way." But rather than asserting myself in letting the person know what I want, I get angry and I try to force - I become what people call the typical female; you know, bitchy and just nagging type of stuff, and that's not the same. I'm asserting myself in the sense that I'm letting the person know what I want, but I'm not doing it in a productive way.
COUNSELOR: You don't wind up feeling good. 0:38:05.1
PATIENT: No, no, and the person doesn't end up feeling good, so there's no cooperation, you know. But I don't know how to just say, you know... I don't know what. I feel guilty. I feel guilty if I say "This is what I need, this is what I want." I have a very hard time with saying that. I think maybe in the last couple of weeks I've really tried to use that - I've put that to work, and at least I'm making an effort now to try it, but the feeling of guilt is still there.
COUNSELOR: So when you say, "This is what I want," what are you experiencing when you say that? Can you say it to me, "This is what I want"?
PATIENT: To you, just that word, "This is what I want"? I mean I don't understand.
COUNSELOR: Just what did you feel? Maybe sort of the moment has passed in a way, but I was wondering, when you said that, you know, you said, "This is what I want," or what the feeling attached to that was when you said it.
PATIENT: Well, there wasn't any expectation to go with that word so there wasn't any feeling for me now, but usually if I want to use that word it's because I want to accomplish something. I want something done to my liking or to my wants, and anytime I try to get something I have this guilt. It's almost as if like I'm telling myself, "You don't deserve it," and sometimes I do feel like I don't deserve it, you know. I could never take any favors without feeling like I owe them back. You know how people, friends, do favors for each other, and you do them because it's a favor, but when people do favors for me I always have to like keep track of these favors, because I feel like then I owe somebody something. I don't want to... 0:40:14.6
COUNSELOR: And if you owe someone something...
PATIENT: I feel guilty. 
COUNSELOR: ...you feel guilty.
PATIENT: Yes. I feel like...
COUNSELOR: What is the feeling of guilt? What is that like?
PATIENT: It is constant. It's like it is a constant reminder. You know, it's like my brain is never at rest and it's like I'm... Let's say you loan me $10. You know, it's like I'm constantly reminding myself that I have to pay that $10 back.
COUNSELOR: And what would happen if you didn't?
PATIENT: Oh, I would feel terrible, you know.
COUNSELOR: You'd feel terrible.
PATIENT: Yeah. I don't think I've ever really been in situations where I haven't somehow repaid a favor back, you know.
COUNSELOR: But you know you would feel terrible.
PATIENT: Yes. Like right now I'm going through a situation where a lawyer is involved into my older job. The way I was let go was... You know, and I brought this thing up with my lawyer because I just felt the way I was let go was just so unfair; no one talked to me about it. There were never any verbal complaints or written complaints about me. And then I come back from a weekend, and I come in the next day; they tell me that I have to turn in my time card, you know. There is no explanation, and I couldn't talk to anybody.
So I called up a family friend who is a lawyer and now... I have no money to afford a lawyer, you know, and I just talked to him to get an idea as to where my rights were. I think people at the job basically expected me to just go away and not bother them again. Well, I can't do that, because my name is, right now, not - it's muddy. Because the way that they let me go they're saying that I've done something, they haven't said what. So just to get my name clear I have to get this thing resolved. And I don't want the job back but...
COUNSELOR: You want to know what their complaint was. 0:42:20.1 
PATIENT: Exactly. I want to know, why wasn't this thing brought up with me verbally or in writing beforehand? Why do you have to wait until after the weekend to tell me this? 
So when I talked to the lawyer, now he's a family friend so he's doing me a favor now, you know, so... Now, if I was a paying customer, paying client where he was just my lawyer, I would not have any problems, you know. I could make demands of him because I am paying him. I can call him up any time I want. I can ask questions. I can say I want to meet with you. I don't feel like I can do that now.
COUNSELOR: Because you're not paying him?
PATIENT: Because I'm not paying him.
COUNSELOR: And what does that mean, not paying him? It means...
PATIENT: It means that I owe him something, like he's doing me a favor. Like I'm inconveniencing him, you know. He could have turned me down, but obviously he didn't, because he could have said, "I'm too busy, but I can refer you to somebody," you know. But he did take on the case, he did bring on somebody else, and I'm at a point where, if something does come out of it, okay, and if I do get any monetary settlement out of it, which would be very little because I was only there a year, then we would talk some sort of a payment, you know, from what I got. But if I didn't get anything then there would not be any sort of payment. But if I know upfront that I am paying you then I feel like I can make more demands as to what my rights are, to satisfy my curiosity or just... 0:44:13.8
Like I called him up a couple of times because I wanted to know about certain things, and he was busy or he wouldn't even get on the phone or he'd return my call later. But he always sounded like he was busy and I didn't want to take up his time, and that feeling I don't like. I don't feel comfortable in that situation where I can't expect a full satisfaction to my satisfaction, you know? Like if I was paying him because he was my lawyer then I can say "I want to know these questions, you know, I like to meet with you on such and such a day, is that okay," you know, but whereas since he's not getting any money from me it's whatever time he can give me I'll accept, you know? And that just makes me feel like I'm not in control, and I think that's what it is. I'm not in control, you know?
COUNSELOR: Yes, you're not in control.
PATIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: And being out of control feels like...
PATIENT: I don't know what that feels like, but I know that I always want to be in - not necessarily in control, but I always want to know what is happening to me. I always want to know what my next step is. And I think that's why I have such a hard time with my fiancï¿½ right now. He is like the day-by-day type; he doesn't want to make any plans. Even when we go on vacations it is "Why book a reservation"? If we feel up to it we'll go to the airline (inaudible at 0:45:59.4).
COUNSELOR: That drives you crazy, yeah.
PATIENT: I can't stand it, you know. I mean I used to plan my life ten years in advance. I mean I knew what I wanted to do in college when I was in junior high school. When I was in high school I knew I would be married. I mean I had my whole life planned out. I'm not that bad now, but I like to at least know what I'm going to be doing a week from now, two weeks from now, you know. And not knowing, I guess that just makes me feel totally out of control, not knowing what's going to happen to me, you know. 
COUNSELOR: And that's sort of what's happening right now in your relationship?
PATIENT: Yeah. 0:46:41.0
