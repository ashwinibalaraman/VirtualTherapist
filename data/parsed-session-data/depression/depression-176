BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>PT:</b> Are we recording the whole session?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, we have to.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> So, what's up?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well.
<b>DR:</b> You were doing the diet drug?
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, I stopped that last month - you know the dental problems I had?  They finally got fixed pretty much.  After eleven weeks.  It started the day after Christmas, got finished two days ago - yesterday, yesterday.  'Cause I had the root - I had the two fillings that needed to become crowns, and then I needed to have root canals and, um, then I had an abscess in the first root canal.  I had a lot of pain.  In fact, last month, I took more pills last month than I've ever taken in my whole life, I swear, 'cause I, I had three antibiotic prescriptions.  The first two, I was allergic to and they gave me thrush.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> I mean it was a mess.  And I was on pain killers for the pain and I was sleeping.  Whenever I wasn't at work, I was asleep.  And, um, then, uh, finally though, we got, I had to take, the insurance company had to give me an override.  They, [INAUDIBLE] is what you take for that.
<b>DR:</b> They wouldn't give you that?
<b>PT:</b> They would give me one, one.  One 150 mg is what you're supposed to take, normal dose, and that's it, once a week, or once, and that's it.  Well, it wasn't working - I took that.  The first night I took the first antibiotic, took it at the same time, and it didn't work.  And, so, they had to give me - the doctor wanted to give me 150 mg for fourteen days in a row, which is fourteen times what they usually give you.  And, so, they said no.  But instantly enough, they wouldn't give me four quarters, but they would give me a dollar.  They gave me twenty one 100 mg pills, so I got to cut seven of them in half, okay, and that's how we did that.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, my God.
<b>PT:</b> But anyway, so I took that and my teeth are better.  I did go see, um -
<b>DR:</b> Well, you didn't eat much during that anyway.
<b>PT:</b> No, I didn't, and I went to see a um, uh, immunologist and I'm seeing him Friday for the results.  'Cause I'm tired of this.  Every time somebody even suggests giving me an antibiotic, I get thrush.
<b>DR:</b> You don't want to do it.
<b>PT:</b> I hardly got the prescription filled and I've already got it.  I'm very, very, very sensitive.  And I figure right now is a problem enough, but when I'm an old lady, it could really be awful, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> Mm.
<b>PT:</b> So, um, anyway.
<b>DR:</b> You're right, so.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I have to say that, um, I have been a little, yknow, my parents have been here for nine weeks, now.  I have one week left.  And then next week, when they leave on Wednesday, we're going with them for a couple days because we're having a family party.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> So, and it really has actually been pretty good.  In fact, last weekend, I took him over to [DEIDENTIFIED] 'cause his dad wanted to see the [DEIDENTIFIED], no not [DEIDENTIFIED], the [DEIDENTIFIED] again.  And, it was bike week.  Something I sort of knew, but didn't think -
<b>DR:</b> Bikers?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, yeah, bikers.  Bike week in [DEIDENTIFIED].  So, between, yknow, and I don't like driving by one or two motorcycles because I'm always afraid, not that I'm gonna hit them, but that they're gonna hit a rock and throw off and I'm gonna get the joy of riding over them, okay?  I got to drive by, I'm not exaggerating, more than a thousand motorcycles, just between [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED].  Both days, both ways, constant motorcycles.  And then I went to go to the beach, because he wanted to see the beach and he is, he's got a bad back now so he can't walk down those stairs, so we drove down there, got stuck in the sand, in the car.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, Jesus.  How did you get out?
<b>PT:</b> Good Samaritans.  It was great.  It was funny, because we had just been there like an hour and we met these people on the elevator.  They were coming in and, um, nice couple, they were out walking and they saw me trying to push the minivan with Mom and Dad in it.  God, anyway, so he was helping me.  We couldn't do it, but another guy came along with a big truck and that guy talked to him and, um, he -
<b>DR:</b> Pulled you out.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I guess this guy - I think he's buying his way to heaven, this one.  He's got like a rope that he carries around with him all the time.  I'm sure he does it every day, every day and he thankfully said to the other guy, don't put it on the axle, put it on the bumper.  When I heard that, I was like oh, if the axle falls off on the beach, I'm really up a creek, yknow?  Anyway, we got out and for some reason Mom didn't want to go down there the next morning again, but, um, my mother is usually kind of a bitcher, but she didn't.  She really controlled herself.  We actually had a really good time.  But I have this, yknow, I really think I've learned a lot about myself lately.  I have this - I don't like confrontations.  I don't like people being annoyed with me.  I just want everyone to play well in the sandbox and, yknow, this probably stems from being laughed at on the playground or something, who knows.  So anyway, I love my parents and I'm on this never ending quest to make them happy, I think is what it is.  And, I mean, I'm not the only person in civilization who's ever done this.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, well -
<b>PT:</b> And, so I was exhausted.  When we got home, I have this way, when I do big events, the next day, I'm always like worse than embalmed.  I call it adrenalinated.  I get my adrenaline so up, that the next day I literally am worse than dead, okay?  I mean, I just feel like I've been hit by a truck and I've just gotten out of the operating room -
<b>DR:</b> My wife does that.  If we go do something for two days -
<b>PT:</b> Then she's gotta -
<b>DR:</b> I can expect her to be down the last, when we come home.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay.  That's how I am.  And I was like that Sunday.  We came home Saturday night and I realized it was time change and I said I'm gonna be crashed.  So we went Friday morning, came back Saturday night.  And I went to bed like nine o'clock Saturday night, got up like nine on Sunday, went back to bed for a nap.  I mean, just exhausted.  And, and, so, I mean, obviously it was very stressful for me to do this because, yknow, I'm driving and my mom's a great backseat driver.  Just a lotta, lotta pressure.  So, but, I think, too, lately, I've had, I noticed I'm a lot more negative than I used to be, but and actually, it's about the world.  I am so disgusted with humanity I keep wondering where I can move that I won't have to be able -
<b>DR:</b> You don't know how many times I've heard that this week.
<b>PT:</b> Is that right?  I'm glad to hear that because I seriously -
<b>DR:</b> The news is horrible.
<b>PT:</b> The news is awful.  And you know what?  It's not just the Iran Iraq stuff.  That's bad enough.  But I hate the nitpicking and what even really makes me madder, because I just expect politicians to be jerks.  And I expect the Middle East to explode because it always has, it always will, from way before I got here and way after I'm gone probably.  But what really bugs me is America.  What really bugs me is a hundred and eighty million dollars severance pay for somebody when other people don't have enough to even have meat in their soup.  Yknow what I mean?  It's like - and I'm not a socialist, I'm not a communist - I am a capitalist, but I'm not an obscenest and that is ridiculous.
<b>DR:</b> I agree.
<b>PT:</b> And, and, it just is really bugging me lately that there's all these people - it just seems to me that evil is way out of control everywhere.  Like I said, I expect it to be out of control in Iran.  I, I want Ward Cleaver to come back.  Yknow what I mean?
<b>DR:</b> And pull us out of there.
<b>PT:</b> I guess.  My parents also have some friends that were staying with us and they're all - the youngest one is, is [AGE], maybe.  So, [AGE] to [AGE], 'cause dad's [AGE].  So they were all very much adults World War II and I said to them it seems like things are so much worse.  And my mother kept trying to tell me, your so negative.  I guess I get it from her.  I don't want anything to be uncomfortable.  But they said, World War II, the difference is the media, for one thing.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  We just have more exposure -
<b>PT:</b> Because you'd go to the movie theaters, see the Movietone movies, remember the movie reel thing you'd see on TV?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you would know what was going on from there.
<b>PT:</b> Right, right.  They didn't have TVs.  They had radio and a movie theater.  And a newspaper.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So, um, and the news was so late, even the newspapers and the other stuff was late in getting there because there wasn't satellite stuff and all that, so.  They said that was worse.  Pearl Harbor was sort of their version of September eleventh, I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yknow, I think, I says, yknow, stuff was going on before that, in like, yknow, I mean like, yeah, there was this little terrorism here and this little there, but September eleventh was so enormous and so at home and so, yknow, I mean, it just seems like everything's just gotten way out of control and that, yknow, I'm not one of these end of days people, but honest to God, I'm hoping it is the end of days because it's like, how much more -
<b>DR:</b> Well it's going to continue.  The terrorists, it's scary.
<b>PT:</b> I know, but it's not the terrorists.  It's the CEOs that are driving me nuts.  And I don't think healthcare or pharmaceutical companies -
<b>DR:</b> Don't forget all these people that are doing stuff to little kids.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> We didn't see that every day.  You didn't used to see that all the time.
<b>PT:</b> No, that's right.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow?
<b>PT:</b> I used to walk to school by myself, stuff like that.  But yknow, a lot of businesses that are for profit, when you think about healthcare and how it started, you think about a bunch of nuns setting up a charity hospital to help people in their suffering, that's what healthcare - it's more a hope we all share now.  I know.  And it's just awful.  So, I've been kind of depressed about this stuff and the other thing is I've been kind of depressed about my job.  I really - it's my new boss.  Although I like her as a person, is totally, totally micromanager and just everything reflects on her and I mean she has driven me nuts.  And when I go from [NAME OTHER] who used to not - I mean, he kind of didn't want me to do for him, but he didn't really care what I was doing much.  And whatever I did was pretty much great and stuff and, uh, I just really do wanna leave - oh, oh, and we just had some good news.  For the first time in more than ten years.  [NAME OTHER] got promoted at a job.  He got promoted the other day.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's great.
<b>PT:</b> He's only been there six months and they made him a manager.  He's not supervising anybody, which is good because he doesn't need to be doing that any more than I do.  I hated it too.  Um, but, but, he's very, and so I'm thinking of moving to at least [DEIDENTIFIED] or someplace so that we're closer.  'Cause it's stupid.  He's driving seventy miles each way, that's seven hundred miles a week to work.  Yknow. 
<b>DR:</b> That's a lot.
<b>PT:</b> It is.  And, I don't know, I've gotten new neighbors.  I've kind of got this itch to change a bunch of stuff.  Change where I work, change where I live, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> Find a job down there and move.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  What I really would like to do is, is work part-time.  Find a way that I can do that. So that I can pursue some of my other things, like the book I wrote that I wanted to - and I got another idea this morning while I was getting ready to work, for another book, and actually it has to do with what we were talking about, the world being so bad.  I'd like to do a be kind series for children.  Maybe we can change how it is.  We can sure - yknow, the pendulum has got to go the other way.
<b>DR:</b> Change the greedy people.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  You're probably, right.
<b>DR:</b> But you can try.  You can do it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Then you won't have to come see me in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.  In fact, my son was begging me to call you because he needs to have an appointment so I said well, okay.  Anyway, but yeah, that wouldn't be a problem.  But still, I'm thinking of going possibly even in between, like [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], you can live down there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't know how much of a commute that would be, though.
<b>DR:</b> It's not, well, to here.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And also, I don't know what the -
<b>DR:</b> I came from [DEIDENTIFIED] last - yesterday morning because I was with my daughter.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> It took me fifty minutes to get here.
<b>PT:</b> She lives in [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Can you get house insurance in [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Can you?  They're leaving, they're leaving.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I've seen the applications.
<b>PT:</b> I know, I know, well, what I've been told is, I have State Farm and assuming they don't leave town - I've had them for eighteen years, or, yknow, but they supposedly will write you somewhere else if you go somewhere else.  But that's one thing, too, I haven't even gone there, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> You have to consider that nowadays.  But there's a lot of building down there and I think it's still cheaper.
<b>PT:</b> I think [NAME OTHER] said that [DEIDENTIFIED].  I've never even been to his office.
<b>DR:</b> It's giant, sprawling -
<b>PT:</b> I've never been down there and we're hoping to go this weekend, 'cause he's been there six months and, uh, I'd like to see it and I understand they have some manor homes in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> You could actually work anywhere from [DEIDENTIFIED] to [DEIDENTIFIED] if you lived there.
<b>PT:</b> I know, that's true.  Assuming that nobody blows up the bridge, yknow, those terrorists we were talking about.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> Then I could go by boat.
<b>DR:</b> True, true.
<b>PT:</b> So, I don't know, anyway, I just - lately - so it's not just me.  Everybody seems to be depressed lately?  'Cause I'm just, I am just.
<b>DR:</b> Well, pointing out that there's a lot of depressing stuff around us, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  And between that, the world environment, having my parents here for nine weeks -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, that's very stressful, too.  You'll try to minimize it while they're here, but I know from my own experience, it is stressful.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I really am ready to get my house back.  And once they leave, a week after I get back from going home with them, my sister's coming for a week with her autistic son.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> Who drives me up a wall, too, because he does things like wipe his diarrhea on the walls and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, geez.
<b>PT:</b> So, I'm really - and then we have our two big events at work, so I really, my light at the end of the tunnel is like [DATE].  By then -
<b>DR:</b> That's not too bad.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's a month.  It's like a month.  And I mean, I've got a lot of stress coming up and I'd like to just resign my job and quit right after that.
<b>DR:</b> No, I mean, you're actively looking into it.
<b>PT:</b> Yknow, that's what I need to do.
<b>DR:</b> You have a good reason to move south -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do, yeah, I do.  And I guess I should just start actively looking.  I'd like to do the radio thing, still.  That's what I really want to do.  And so -
<b>DR:</b> That's down in [DEIDENTIFIED] though, right?
<b>PT:</b> It's [DEIDENTIFIED], but I could still do that.  But I'd like to do it somewhere else and get paid to do it, instead of just do it as a show once a week, yknow?  And I said to [NAME OTHER] a couple weeks ago, you'll be proud of me that I realized this.  I'm driving, home, talking to him, I'm complaining about the job, which happens every day, and I said, I really want to work in radio and then I thought I guess that means I should probably apply for a job at a radio station.  If I don't apply for a job at a radio station, how do I think I'm ever gonna work in radio?  Yknow what I mean?  It's like I had this epiphany.  I suddenly realized well, there's one reason you're not working there.  You're not even asking to work there, so, so, sometimes it's those little, tiny, stupid things that hit you over the head like a hammer because you're like, oh my, God.
<b>DR:</b> I asked this graduating high school kid today, he said I don't want to go to school right now.  I says what do you want to do?  He said well, I'm interested in cinematography.
<b>PT:</b> So, go to school for cinematography.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  I mean, you better start looking for jobs at a TV station.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, absolutely.  Did you tell him about [DEIDENTIFIED] over in [DEIDENTIFIED]?  That's a real good school.
<b>DR:</b> No.  He didn't even, he didn't even have any idea, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, he needs to look into that and, but [DEIDENTIFIED]'s hard, though.  [DEIDENTIFIED] would be better, yknow.  'Cause [DEIDENTIFIED], they only take twenty a year in their film school.  But [DEIDENTIFIED] is -
<b>DR:</b> They're very selective.
<b>PT:</b> That's the whole purpose of the school.  I have a friend who went there, he's working for [DEIDENTIFIED].  So, yknow, and he was on [DEIDENTIFIED] something or other radio for a while and he's only [AGE] or something, so.  I mean, he's worked steadily since getting out of there, yeah.  It's like a sailboat sail.  Full sail.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And, um, anyway, but it's a good school.  But, um.
<b>DR:</b> Anyway, you're right, you gotta try.
<b>PT:</b> I know, but duh.  I know.  And sometimes you don't even think that, but I really, I think I have, yknow, I, part of me wants to leave there like in six weeks.  Part of me wants to stay for the rest of the year because I'm about to learn something new.  I have an opportunity coming up to learn how to do web sites.
<b>DR:</b> Well, when will that happen?
<b>PT:</b> Soon, because I'm gonna be the - now that doesn't mean I'm gonna be able to design web sites, but I'll at least know how - I'll know more about them than I do right now.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> And that would be a skill that I could actually benefit from knowing.  So, I try to tell myself these things.  And I've had a goal since October what I was gonna do.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, 'cause I think all you gotta do is tell yourself, uh, come May I'm gonna start looking and if something comes up, I go.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I really can't start looking until then.
<b>DR:</b> You don't have to stay until the end of the year.
<b>PT:</b> That's true, yeah.  And I really can't start before then anyway because I got so much going on it's ridiculous.  Actually, like I said, after May, or the end of April, I should have it together.  At least have a little more time for me.  And I'm afraid to look online at work for anything.  And when I'm at home, I don't have any time because -
<b>DR:</b> Well, you got people there.
<b>PT:</b> My parents are there, right.  And so, I just have to wait for everyone to leave before I can have some time back to do what I want to do.
<b>DR:</b> Nine weeks is a long time.
<b>PT:</b> It's ten weeks, so yeah.  And the thing is, I love them to death, and everyone says - and most of my friends don't have their parents any more.  Everyone says you're so lucky and I know that, but I really have been harassing them this past year to buy their own place down here.  Even down the street from me.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] do that, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I told them how much fun it would be to go through their house together and look at all their stuff, instead of me doing it after they're dead.  And I said I don't know the treasure from the trash.  I won't.  We could have a great time sitting in their house, looking at stuff.  Yknow what I mean?  It could be fun to go through.  Just when you go in an old closet, you look at stuff you haven't looked at in twenty five years.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] house, right?
<b>PT:</b> No, no.  And they should.  It's a two-story house.  They're [AGE] and [AGE] and they do not belong in a two-story house, in [DEIDENTIFIED] or even suburban [DEIDENTIFIED], yknow?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So, it's just, um.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you still got 'em, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> I know.  I love 'em to death.  And actually, my mother, she won't take Prozac any more, yknow, she got that rash and everything and speaking of rash -
<b>DR:</b> There's lots of other stuff.
<b>PT:</b> She just won't, but she's better than she's been a lot of times.  Do you think there's any possibility that Wellbutrin, 'cause that's the newer one, could cause mouth problems?  Because I've got this constant, irritated redness in there -
<b>DR:</b> I don't think so.
<b>PT:</b> And the only thing I consistently have taken for the last - Prozac for what, seventeen years or something, sixteen years, but Wellbutrin, only the last several months.  And I've had this - it's been going on, and my gums are just red and they hurt.  When I got the thrush, it was worse.  I just thought I'd ask you that because it occurred to me -
<b>DR:</b> Well, when did we start it?  November?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  It was probably last fall, sometime.  I don't know if you can see it.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you can stop it and see.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I kind of hate to stop it with the world in a shambles -
<b>DR:</b> That's the ultimate - but that is the ultimate test, but.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.  But I just wondered, well, before I just went and messed with my medication, I wondered if you thought there was any chance.
<b>DR:</b> You took it actually last spring and summer.
<b>PT:</b> Did I?  Okay.  Well, see the thing is, I don't realize, I don't remember how long this has been going on like that.  It's just been pretty bad.  Well, you know what, I'm not gonna do anything until I see the doctor Friday and get the results of the immunology studies that we did.  And -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'll see what he says.  Yknow, they're always doing the tests for do you have AIDS or HIV or this or that.  I don't have any of that.  If I do, it's gonna be a real surprise.
<b>DR:</b> Hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Yknow, because, I've know what toilet seat I got it off of but that would be -
<b>DR:</b> Nah, nah, they might come up with something.
<b>PT:</b> But I'm not diabetic either, and that's all the things they always ask, yknow.  I mean, it's just, um, I don't know.  But anyway, I wanted to come see you earlier because I just felt like, I just need to make a change.  I have this urge to make several changes.  Does that seem weird?
<b>DR:</b> Well, it will be so.  They're very big things.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm trying to change everything but my husband, pretty much.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I'm looking to change jobs, hopefully change careers a bit, or at least alter it a bit.  Move.  And, yknow, this stress test, it puts me over at like four hundred thousand or something, yknow.  And with my luck, somebody will buy in the time that they have and that happens to add to the stress.  Because I'm looking, I got like some prime candidates in [DEIDENTIFIED], yknow and, um.
<b>DR:</b> Probably anyway, you ought to take a little time and look at the housing down there.  You'll have that in your head.  And then see what jobs might be there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You could do a lot of different jobs.
<b>PT:</b> I know, I know.  That's the thing.  So, that's kind of what I'm thinking, but I do - and I love my house.  We built the house.  I never wanted to move out of it, but we got new neighbors, too.  And that's changing the whole thing.  Yknow, everything's just changing and change is never easy.  Nobody likes - I'm convinced that hardly anybody likes change.
<b>DR:</b> Right, but  those who adapt to the change best are the winners.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I think I generally adapt pretty well to change.  Most of the time, but -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's just, I don't know.
