BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Hi.
<b>PT:</b> Hello.  How are you?
<b>DR:</b> I'm good, how are you?
<b>PT:</b> Good.
<b>DR:</b> Did you get stuck out there yesterday like I did?
<b>PT:</b> No, I got stuck but, you know, I had to drive through [INAUDIBLE] a bit
<b>DR:</b> Did you drive that, what time did you drive that?
<b>PT:</b> I was driving, we were in, I work in [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I know, that's where I was yesterday.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> I never
<b>PT:</b> The [INAUDIBLE] was I think by [DEIDENTIFIED] wasn't it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well they locked me in the basement for an hour because they said there was a tornado
<b>PT:</b> Tornado warning.
<b>DR:</b> Did they do that to you?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I had the option of going in the basement but we just stayed upstairs and kept doing what we were doing.
<b>DR:</b> How about driving home?
<b>PT:</b> I had to drive through some water.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But I have a van so I wasn't too worried about it but it was pretty
<b>DR:</b> It was scary.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Did anybody come in the shop?
<b>PT:</b> No, not during that time, no.
<b>DR:</b> It was an experience, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we had corn feast going on this weekend, do you know about that in [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>DR:</b> No, did that get
<b>PT:</b> So they cancelled it for tonight but they'll probably do it tomorrow.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they closed the school today too because of flooding, yeah, you weren't flooded where you live.
<b>PT:</b> No.  Well, we had some flooding but we're fine at our house but some ladies who work there live near the river and they had a lot of damage so, but we're okay.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How are you?
<b>PT:</b> Been feeling better.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> I think last time I talked to you we were going to be going to [DEIDENTIFIED] and I was, had been having a hard time probably since the middle of July when we went on our first trip to [DEIDENTIFIED] and then my husband got hurt on the job
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So he finally has gone back to work this week and that's lifted a lot of
<b>DR:</b> I bet he was ready to go back.
<b>PT:</b> Trouble.  Yeah, he was.  The more better he was feeling, the more bearable he was at home so that made it easier but he's glad to go back and I felt better since we got back on the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> What was it like, the [DEIDENTIFIED] trip?  His family was there again?
<b>PT:</b> No, it was just us and we stayed in [DEIDENTIFIED] which I won't probably do that again.  I think we'll pay the extra money and stay some place nicer, yeah, but it was a nice trip, we had a good time.
<b>DR:</b> All the kids went?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You didn't feel overwhelmed at all?
<b>PT:</b> Not too badly.  We fought pretty bad before we left, my husband and I, so that was, so the ride there we were fighting.
<b>DR:</b> What did you fight about?
<b>PT:</b> I'm not even sure, he was just still being, well I thought he was being a creep but I can't even quite remember now.  I was quick to cry over everything and just things weren't going very well but as soon as we pulled into our driveway I felt a lot better just being home.
<b>DR:</b> The safety.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think so.
<b>DR:</b> You felt real fragile when you were away.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I did a lot better than I thought I would and my husband even remarked that I did a lot better, that I did pretty well considering, not knowing really where we were going and that kind of thing, so
<b>DR:</b> Was part of the anxiety being in a new setting or a new place?
<b>PT:</b> Part of it is because I really don't like leaving home a lot.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And having to stay somewhere else, yeah, just the unknown probably.
<b>DR:</b> So fear, fear was underlying the tears?
<b>PT:</b> Probably, yeah, but he's just been hurtful lately.  He's doing better now that he's able to do more and is able to work, he feels better.
<b>DR:</b> When you
<b>PT:</b> It doesn't come back at me.
<b>DR:</b> Her was attacking you verbally?
<b>PT:</b> I felt like it, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What would he say?
<b>PT:</b> I can't remember why were fighting, I think it probably was about sex again because he wanted to have it and gets kind of jerky when he doesn't get and it and I'm supposed to just all of the sudden be passionate and into him when he's not being very nice and it doesn't work that way for me so that was underlying for him, what was going on.
<b>DR:</b> So he probably uses the sex as a calming device for him.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> He was under stress because he was hurting, he wasn't working.
<b>PT:</b> Right and to him that's extremely important and that, if we're having sex then we're getting along and then we have a good relationship, if we're not, it's like the rest, in my eyes, the rest doesn't matter as much.
<b>DR:</b> When he insists on sex, does it give you flashbacks?
<b>PT:</b> He very seldom insists, instead he'll just get meaner and meaner each day, well, I can tell something is bothering him and I guess if I was a good wife, I'd just, you know, I know what will make you feel better, why don't we just, but I don't because I'm upset and he's been
<b>DR:</b> So it makes you want to pull away?
<b>PT:</b> Taking it out on me.  Right.
<b>DR:</b> The more you pull away, the more upset he gets, so it's a cycle.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So how do you get through it?
<b>PT:</b> We talked about it and we understand that's what happens and we still have not been able to stop it from happening in the first place.  I think his opinion is for us to stop it and maybe it is, I just need to be available all the time and I don't agree with that.
<b>DR:</b> Does it make you feel used?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it does, very much so and I try and tell him that, he doesn't understand that because to him, if we are sexual then he feels wanted and needed and intimate with me on an emotional level too and I don't always feel that.  I mean I do, once we do, I mean of course I feel much better usually unless it's kind of a grudge intercourse.
<b>DR:</b> Grudge.
<b>PT:</b> Just to try and make him happy, then I don't always feel all that much better but if
<b>DR:</b> Then you feel more used?
<b>PT:</b> It quiets his mood and then we can get by a little better, so we're still having trouble with that.
<b>DR:</b> Is there a way to avoid that whole type of interaction?
<b>PT:</b> I guess if I'm just more available, I guess, I can't decide, I think we both are the reason why but I just think he's, I don't know, it makes me mad that he's like that.  He says I should be glad that he's even interested which I guess I am but it doesn't feel like, it still doesn't feel like it's interest in me necessarily.  I happen to be his wife and, therefore
<b>DR:</b> But just the vehicle to get his needs meet.
<b>PT:</b> That's how I feel when I'm pressured on just by his attitude and sometimes he does make comments, you know, or just tries to, he finds it difficult to even ask anymore.  He feels rejected when I don't, so I don't know, I don't know, I'm off the Prozac, I'm off all that stuff that I thought was causing the trouble, so
<b>DR:</b> How different do you feel being off it?
<b>PT:</b> I feel, I don't know if it's made much of a difference or not in my libido or anything else.  I think I feel better being off of it mood wise.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> In what way?
<b>PT:</b> I think my mood is better just in general and then I stopped the Lithium and that's been okay.  That week was hard and I don't know that it had anything to do with taking it every other day and then I stopped that Friday after I saw you and that's been fine, I'm surprised.  I don't know if it stays in your system a long time.
<b>DR:</b> No, you were just on the one 300.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> That goes pretty quick. 
<b>PT:</b> So I don't know if it's, I feel okay so far.
<b>DR:</b> No mood instability?
<b>PT:</b> No, so I'm kind of waiting.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> Because before vacation, I felt really really bad, I was getting pretty depression where I was very irritable and very weepy and very angry a lot and I'm not sure any outside, I'm not sure why if it was just having him home, I thought I'd be happy to have him home.  I should have been enjoying that time and then I guess I probably feel guilty that I'm not
<b>DR:</b> I just wonder if you felt your time was more encroached upon in some way.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think so
<b>DR:</b> With him there.
<b>PT:</b> And I seem to do less though when he's around, so
<b>DR:</b> So you let him take on more
<b>PT:</b> So I'm sleeping later and he's doing everything and he has to go and do something every day where he gets really nutty, he can't stand to be in the house very long.  He has to be out running around doing stuff.  He takes the kids with but I don't feel I need to go
<b>DR:</b> But you're actually feeling better since you went back to work, less pressure
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You get out and do things more.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, I did today which, you know, I worked yesterday and he just went back Tuesday, which I slept Tuesday and Wednesday pretty late but the kids go back to school Monday so I have to get up.  I think I'm kind of looking forward to that. 
<b>DR:</b> Will the baby be in school?
<b>PT:</b> Not yet, she's got another year but she's, they're all nice to have around but when it's one it's really very different than having all four so I'm looking forward to it, yeah, it'll be nice.  We'll get out of the house more and
<b>DR:</b> Exercise?
<b>PT:</b> Actually, my mom signed us up for a stretching class so I'm going to do that one night a week for like six weeks.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> So that'll be the first thing I've ever signed up for since high school sports.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> So 
<b>DR:</b> Alone or
<b>PT:</b> My mom and I will go
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so that'll be nice and that'll get me to go since it's my mom and I don't tell her no, so
<b>DR:</b> Maybe she's doing that to kind of make up for something that's going on in her life.
<b>PT:</b> I think so, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Try to be kind of more close to you.  It'll be good for both of you.
<b>PT:</b> I think so, yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
<b>DR:</b> Has she talked more to you about the divorce situation?
<b>PT:</b> Not really, she's pretty pulled away pretty much and now she's, she's a teacher so now she's back in school and her time's pretty used up, you know, by the time she gets home and whatever else.
<b>DR:</b> So her mood seems a little brighter?
<b>PT:</b> Not really, no, my sister is home from [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>DR:</b> From where?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>DR:</b> For how long is she home?
<b>PT:</b> Just till Sunday morning or Sunday afternoon and I went there last night and my mom was in bed and didn't even come out.  We had to go in there and talk to her and she said she's been kind of out it the last few days.
<b>DR:</b> Depressed?
<b>PT:</b> I think so, the weather didn't help, I don't think.
<b>DR:</b> And you've had no contact with your step dad?
<b>PT:</b> With who?
<b>DR:</b> Your step dad.
<b>PT:</b> No, I've seen him.  He's been out there a few times and they're still talking which kind of leaves us all wondering but it's kind of
<b>DR:</b> Does she want to get back together with him?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so but I know she enjoys his company and doesn't like being alone but she says she can only take it for a little while and then she remembers, you know, that he cheated and whatever else and so then she gets angry again and gets feeling bad but
<b>DR:</b> But she doesn't ask you for your advice.
<b>PT:</b> I think she thinks I have too much going on with myself
<b>DR:</b> And doesn't want
<b>PT:</b> That or she doesn't want to talk about it.  I think that might be it too.
<b>DR:</b> It's too painful.
<b>PT:</b> I think so, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Did you tell her you stopped some of the medications?
<b>PT:</b> I told my sister who works for a couple of neurosurgeons so she has access to some medical information.
<b>DR:</b> She works what?
<b>PT:</b> For a couple of neurosurgeons.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> In an office in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I discussed the medicines with her and she was very glad I was off the Lithium
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Especially she was concerned about that.  She gets online and looks it all us and so
<b>DR:</b> But it's good that you're not feeling significantly different.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm really surprised because I really thought I noticed a significant difference when I started it, which I noticed it right away and I don't think that's actually possible medically but, no nothing, I feel good still
<b>DR:</b> Even better, you said.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> After that initial week of getting off of it, you know
<b>DR:</b> Well, I mean well keep doing the exercise.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Are you going to miss her when she goes home?  She's married there?
<b>PT:</b> She's not married, she has a boyfriend there though, a live in boyfriend, so she's kind of attached there for now.  We're hoping they'll move this way.
<b>DR:</b> He didn't come with her?
<b>PT:</b> No, he didn't.  She's going to a wedding for her friends.
<b>DR:</b> How did she meet him?
<b>PT:</b> She met him in the service, she's in the Air Force and he's a Marine and stationed in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> He is?
<b>PT:</b> Both of them were together, separately but met each other there in [DEIDENTIFIED] and she moved in with him.  His family is from [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> So she moved there
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> But you miss her
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do and it's always kind of strange when she's home.  I think it is for my mom too because you know she's going to leave again.  So most of the time, I'm thinking about that I think instead of, but my other sister is in town too, so I got to see them today.  That was nice.
<b>DR:</b> It was comfortable?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, kind of
<b>DR:</b> But not really.
<b>PT:</b> It never really is, I always feel like I'm just inadequate in a lot of ways.
<b>DR:</b> How come?
<b>PT:</b> I'm not a good hostess, I don't have any, you know, why don't we go do, I'm not that kind of person to plan things and with all the kids, I don't know, I just, I don't know, I never feel very much like a good sister and do what I should for having my sisters come from out of town and want to see them so badly
<b>DR:</b> You always focus on what you're not doing.
<b>PT:</b> I know it.
<b>DR:</b> Rather than what you do.
<b>PT:</b> I feel like I don't do anything.
<b>DR:</b> I'm sure they were glad just to see you and spend time.
<b>PT:</b> I hope so but
<b>DR:</b> Did they seem to be glad to see you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, so tomorrow night we'll get together again, have dinner at my mom's probably.
<b>DR:</b> Take them to the corn boil?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if we'll go do that, they're probably not interested, yeah, so, but I'm going to work this week and tomorrow and Sunday since we get busy being downtown with the festival.
<b>DR:</b> I wonder with all the floodings if it's going to happen.
<b>PT:</b> I know, they're talking about cancelling tomorrow too but I can't imagine they'll do that, it's a pretty big deal for a lot of the residents.
<b>DR:</b> When I left last night, it was all flooded.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The downtown.
<b>PT:</b> Was it?
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, it's really something and I don't know if that river, there's a river on the other side
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>DR:</b> That was overflowing.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I'm sure, yeah, that's what the two ladies who live near it, yeah, it is, it's bad.  We're near it but not near enough where it did any damage to use, it's just kind of in the fields around us so, yeah, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> You never had problems where you are did you, in [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know, I don't know if they had any warnings out.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah the sirens were going off
<b>PT:</b> Yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>PT:</b> I know in [DEIDENTIFIED] it was.
<b>DR:</b> You heard them too?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, my kids were in the country in [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>DR:</b> What were they doing?
<b>PT:</b> They were with my sister in law in the morning and then they went with my mother in law, they live right next to each other
<b>DR:</b> Were they scared?
<b>PT:</b> Hopefully my mother in law had them when the storm came because my sister in law is deathly afraid.  She would have had them in a panic.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And she has no basement which makes her even more afraid but she can go right next door
<b>DR:</b> The kids didn't talk about it?
<b>PT:</b> No, I forgot to ask them too.  I'll have to find out, I think
<b>DR:</b> Are they frightened of storms, the kids?
<b>PT:</b> Not too badly, yeah, well kind of.  The two younger ones get a little nervous and start worrying about the pets and are we going to get everybody in the basement and that sort of thing and my oldest has this kind of fascination fear thing with tornados and seems to like them and wants to look at pictures of that kind of thing and gets real, kind talks himself, tries to reassure himself when there is a storm.
<b>DR:</b> That he's okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that the tornado, there's not one coming, you know, but he really is scared, you can tell.  My [AGE] old, though, he does pretty good.  He's a pretty solid kid.  He's very reliable and would probably help take care of everybody else.  Yeah, I'll have to ask them, I didn't think about that.
<b>DR:</b> It sounds like he probably would say it was fine.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I'll have to ask the little ones.  I do need more of, another prescription for the diuretic.  I only got the, I still have like four left, I started menstruating well before I thought I was going to so I had started it soon after I started feeling real irritable and it seemed to help so
<b>DR:</b> It took [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Yeah after a couple, two or three days, it started to
<b>DR:</b> I think I only gave you the 25 mg which is the lowest dose.
<b>PT:</b> Is it.  You gave me just ten so I've got four left.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, do you want to try a higher dose?
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> Or do you feel that's sufficient.
<b>PT:</b> Sure, I'll try a higher dose.  I mean it gets 
<b>DR:</b> Pretty bad.
<b>PT:</b> It used to be a lot worse, the PMS used to be really
<b>DR:</b> The what?
<b>PT:</b> The PMS that I would get
<b>DR:</b> The bloating, what about the bloating, did you notice a reduction in the bloating this time?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think I did after the initial, after the first few days with the mood and the bloating.
<b>DR:</b> Why did it come early, does it sometimes do that?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes but it was like
<b>DR:</b> Several days?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, like almost more than a week I think.
<b>DR:</b> I wonder if that was the traveling and the stress, associated with traveling.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe.
<b>DR:</b> Is that when it happened, when you were on the trip or no?
<b>PT:</b> It was before.
<b>DR:</b> Before the trip.
<b>PT:</b> It was on the ninth, so I guess it was only like five days earlier but it does that some times, it just starts skipping ahead a few days so I'm running all though the different times of the month
<b>DR:</b> There's no time to calculate when to actually start.
<b>PT:</b> Right, usually if I'm getting irritable, now I'm hoping that's what's wrong with me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and the bloating.
<b>PT:</b> Because that's what's happening.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, good, definitely we'll try another cycle
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And see and then, other than that, I mean just the exercise
<b>PT:</b> Right and I'm still taking the Requip and I notice if I forget to take it, I notice the symptoms right away.
<b>DR:</b> Are you taking one?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if that's
<b>DR:</b> One pill?
<b>PT:</b> I'm just taking one pill at night.  I tried taking two and I kept getting sick to my stomach.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And so I went back to one and felt fine.  I was able to take it right before bed.
<b>DR:</b> And the legs don't jump at all at night?
<b>PT:</b> I stretch them out a little bit and it seems to help but if I don't take it and try and lay down, it's really bad right away.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I never even noticed the symptoms until I started taking medicine.
<b>DR:</b> You mean the improvement of the symptoms?
<b>PT:</b> No, that I even had symptoms.  I found out about it because I had a sleep study done
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And that's when they told me that I had restless leg syndrome, otherwise, I really didn't know, I just felt tired.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> So that thought maybe that was why I was tired and
<b>DR:</b> Are you less tired now as a result of the Requip, if you sleep better through the night are your legs
<b>PT:</b> If I, if I can get to sleep.  There are some nights where I'm not able to sleep lately too, so I'm hoping that'll, I think once I get on a better schedule
<b>DR:</b> Since stopping the Prozac, has the sleep worsened?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, you seem to be better
<b>PT:</b> I still have acne.
<b>DR:</b> You're less afraid.  Well the acne is from the Prozac
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> We thought it was but the Prozac is something that takes a long time to come out of your system too.
<b>PT:</b> Does it?
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, I think the half life is somewhere between 96 hours at a minimum and the breakdown product I think can be up to, you know, a week.
<b>PT:</b> I've been off it for quite a while though.
<b>DR:</b> I would just watch it.  Do you, are you taking any
<b>PT:</b> I take Strattera and the Requip and then I just started the diuretic right before but that's
<b>DR:</b> No, I mean for the acne.
<b>PT:</b> I might try a dermatologist next.  I don't know what, we talked last time, thinking some of my problems might be hormonal.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So do you think the diuretic is
<b>DR:</b> That won't hurt, help your hormone cycle but I think I'd be more inclined to treat it conservatively, temporarily, use like Oxyclean, things like that
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Just topical and if it was from the Prozac then over time it'll improve.  If it's not, if it is hormonal, you might need some medication.
<b>PT:</b> All right, so maybe I'll ask my gynecologist, I need to make an appointment for that.  Can they check estrogen levels?
<b>DR:</b> They could check your estrogen level, it's a little bit tricky because it has to be done in different parts of the cycle, the levels are different, but they could do that, but yeah, if the period is changing in terms of getting shorter because you're a little bit young for that to start happening so they could check it and see.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But no, the diuretic wouldn't have anything to do with hormone or effect hormones, all that's going to do is decrease the bloating and if the bloating was contributing to the, yeah, to the irritability, it'll reduce that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So I'll give you a refill on that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And you don't need refills on the other two?
<b>PT:</b> I'm in a
<b>DR:</b> Or you do?
<b>PT:</b> No, not yet.  I have a refill left on each of those and I think they're both ninety day.
<b>DR:</b> So you'll be okay.
<b>PT:</b> But after that then I'll need them but for now
<b>DR:</b> So now just that
<b>PT:</b> So I'll be okay for like three months.
<b>DR:</b> Do you want me to give you like thirty of the diuretic?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that'd be great.
<b>DR:</b> You can use them for several cycles.
<b>PT:</b> I'm hoping I'll catch it in time where I get enough of them in.
<b>DR:</b> Well, we'll go up to 50 mg.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> We'll up 25 to 50.
<b>PT:</b> Good, all right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, do the corn boil, thanks for this.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
