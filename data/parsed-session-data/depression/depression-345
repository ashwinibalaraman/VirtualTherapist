BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: I'm okay; doing all right. So what's on your mind?
CLIENT: Everything and nothing. I don't know. I'm having a really hard time but I don't know what to talk about. Yesterday, I did some things, paying of bills and filling out of financial aid forms, and things that I had been putting off for a week and a half. But (inaudible) calling James (ph) and saying, "Okay, in two hours, I'm going to call you back (inaudible) just be on the phone with me while I do these." (inaudible) So that was good because I really didn't think I was going to be able to, two hours later. But we (ph) got through it.
THERAPIST: Oh, good. [00:01:01]
CLIENT: And [just had] (ph) spent the rest of the day either watching television or staring at space. (laughter) So not much happened in the last 24 hours. (laughter)
THERAPIST: I see, by contrast (inaudible) -
CLIENT: I guess, a relief (ph). (inaudible) talk to my sister. (pause [00:01:33] to 00:01:39) (inaudible) home from the hospital but they still don't know what's going on because she was supposed to have a colonoscopy and she just freaked out. And she's like, "I can't do it right now." And, so, they discharged her and figured (ph) they could do it later - her mom was here, taking care of her; so that's good. [00:02:00] So I don't, really, need to be the point person there, which is nice.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Although I (inaudible) - said, repeatedly, "Anything that you need me to do (inaudible) - " But (sighs) I really wasn't up to talking to her mom. (laughter) (inaudible) there was times, sometimes, I was hiding in my room. (laughter) (pause [00:02:29] to 00:02:57) I don't know. [00:03:00] (pause from [00:03:01] to 00:03:10)
THERAPIST: Is your mind, kind of, blank or - ?
CLIENT: Yes, I just feel really helpless and I don't have any ideas. (pause from [00:03:22] to 00:03:42) (inaudible) I'm just hanging on. (pause) [00:04:03] I don't know what to do next (ph). (pause) I have not been cutting myself (inaudible)
THERAPIST: That's (ph) good.
CLIENT: I'm wanting to, which is bad. But (inaudible) I need to stop that. [It isn't fair of me.] (ph) My parents are [giving up] (ph). (pause [00:04:59] to 00:05:23) I'm having trouble taking care of myself. I don't know how much feeling like crap all the time has to do with not eating very well, or not eating very regularly. I did end up eating dinner last night, but it was, kind of, touch and go. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: How so?
CLIENT: Well, the - I'm not really that hungry and I just don't (sighs) [00:06:02] - All of the things that you're supposed to do, this kind of self care, that's supposed to keep you on track, I can't make any of that seem important enough to get up for. (pause) So - (pause [00:06:33] to 00:07:02) I didn't apply for a job yesterday - or I haven't so far this week. (sighs) And I need to (inaudible) back on.
THERAPIST: That's hard to do, too.
CLIENT: Yes. (pause [00:07:21] to 00:07:58) (inaudible) I know that I'm the only one who can make these changes or who can - you know, I am the one who has to get better. [00:08:08] I am the only one who can do that. But I feel like all - you know, the past week, especially, I felt like all of the things that I put my faith in, are just, kind of, collapsed around my ears. And, now, I don't know what to do.
THERAPIST: What things are those?
CLIENT: Well, so, I put my faith in the mind. And I know my ability to figure things out and I just can't figure it out. It's just not working; it's not - it's just not the right tool, or something. [00:09:00] Its not - (sighs) - and, you know, the more that James (ph) tried to figure it out with me, the more frustrated I get with him. Because he's - it's not the right way to do it, but I don't know what is the right way. And I put my faith in relationships and (inaudible) taking care of each other, but I don't - (sighs)
And people love me a lot and that hurts me. Because it doesn't make sense and I can't deal with it. And the - [00:10:01] I believe in God but I've - I don't try to use my religion as a way to get out of this. Because, I mean, I stopped believing in God when I was about - I don't know, 12 or 13 or 14, because I would pray every night for this to go away and it never did. And that's why I stopped believing in God. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: So it's like, "Well, I don't have much faith there." (laughter) And I (pause) [00:11:02] So I'm just lost. (pause [00:11:10] to 00:11:42)
THERAPIST: Does it feel, again, as though I'm being hurtful to you as like - ?
CLIENT: No, I'm pretty much over that.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: (chuckles) That's why I told you because, then, I get over it. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Okay. (chuckles) [00:12:02]
CLIENT: Yes. Now, I mean, a part of me wants you to have an answer but I know that you don't. So (laughter) there we go.
THERAPIST: Yes. (pause)
CLIENT: (pause) And I can't figure out your process so I'm just along for the ride, which is fun, actually. (laughter) The longer I know you, the less I know what you're going to say next. [00:13:03]
THERAPIST: (laughter)
CLIENT: (laughter) - which I like. (laughter) But its, really (ph), terrifying, of course. (chuckles) But I'm okay with that. (pause [00:13:19] to 00:14:19) (inaudible) It feels like my grip on reality is shifting. I don't think that's the case, like I'm not having hallucinations. I just - I feel like this is not the real world, or this can't be real, or what is real to me is not the same thing that everyone else is experiencing. (pause [00:15:00] to 00:16:03)
THERAPIST: Are these things that you felt more acutely when you were feeling bad? That you're, now, feeling more pervasively all the time? Or is it different than that?
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Like -
CLIENT: What's the "these" (ph)?
THERAPIST: The sense of your grip on reality shifting or not being - or feeling the things you'd believed in, collapsing?
CLIENT: Yes, I guess - (pause) it is (ph), approximately, right. [00:17:02] That I'm used to, kind of, having an episode, or a period of really intense distress, and then it does feel like everything is collapsed and it does feel like I'm in this other world. And, now, its - yes, it's more and more of the time, even when I'm not, necessarily, as intensely distressed or when I am, kind of - and it feels - I mean, I think that the - this sense of unreality is exacerbated by my increasing ability to - just to go around and function and interact with people while I'm having this really hard time. [00:18:05]
You know, so that I can pull it together, for as long as it takes, to go like see my roommate in the hospital and talk with her friend and take care of her. But that's not, really, where I am. (pause [00:18:28] to 00:18:43) Yes, watching science fiction TV shows does (ph) not help. You know, if you watch (inaudible) (chuckles) - it's a really good show, but they're on a - like the last few episodes really messed with my mind yesterday. (laughter)
THERAPIST: I see. [00:19:00]
CLIENT: Usually, it's kind of campy and fun and, just my luck, they decided to go dark at this one period. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: (pause) (sighs) Yes, I mean, the best thing - the best experience that I've had in the last couple of days was reading a book that was really, really good. And I just - (sighs) - when I - when I read a really good book, it's like I can see all of the levels at the same time as I'm reading it. [00:20:05]
So the - emotional, sweep of the plot and, then, it's like I can see both what's on the page and what's backstage, at the same time. And that's just really satisfying for me; it's one of the best things. [If I had just read] (ph) - randomly (ph) picked up, it was - I had had it for a while and I don't know why I hadn't read it before. [It's "The Prime of Miss Jean Brody"] (ph), which is a novella about a teacher in Edinborough, in the 1930s. It turned out to be brilliant.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: It was really nice. In some ways, that was the most real thing that's happened to me. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Yes. What was it about?
CLIENT: I'm sorry?
THERAPIST: What was it about?
CLIENT: It is about a teacher in Edinborough, in the 1930s, who latched - clasps on to this one group of five students and, kind of, molded into (ph) her own image. [00:21:15] And says, "Okay, well, hold up your books and if anybody comes by, we're doing our history lesson. But, now, I'm going to tell you about my fianc√©, who died in World War I." And, in some ways, it's like exploring the influence that she has on these children, from when they're 10 to 16, and it floats (ph) back and forth in time, into their later lives, and forward.
And you know, from the beginning - or you know, as time goes on, that one of her students helps the headmistress in getting this teacher fired, eventually. And, so, it's kind of like is she a force for good or ill (ph), in these children's lives. [00:22:01] And she really is - yes, it's really interesting. The closest parallel, from my life, was that I had a favorite teacher, who had much the same kind of (inaudible) personality. I loved him when I was in high school. And he was very, kind of, a father figure.
But, also, when I was in high school, I made some pretty serious mistakes, in terms of handling some shit that was going down with Hank (ph) and my relationship. As in, that was the time I needed the authorities at the school to step in and say, "No, you two cannot see each other again" or "we're going to take steps to make sure that you can't." Because it was clear that I was being abused. And he (ph) didn't do that. And, as I got to be an adult, and especially as I was a teacher with him, I find (ph) him increasingly difficult, because he's just - he's just got this massive ego. [00:23:10]
And it really is all about him. (sighs) And another (ph) of my classmates, who were also very close to him, and (ph) had that same realization - or have had that same experience of (inaudible) - so it's weird. I think, at the same time, he really is a resource for, kind of, the children that get lost in the shuffle and at school. And he said (ph) it's really important that he be there and he does love them and care about them. And he's really good to them. But it, also, is, kind of, a "molding you in my own image" sort of thing.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: That's not healthy. So, I mean - yes. [00:24:04] But (inaudible) good book, you know? I was reading something really good and - I don't know -
THERAPIST: [Other than] (ph), sort of, very well constructed and compelling?
CLIENT: Yes, compelling, multilayered, a lot going on under the surface, very elegant. The theme that she's working with, she treats really (inaudible) and brings them - brings them up but doesn't belabor them. But its - [00:25:01] Yes, it's just kind of - they talk about Hemingway, saying the "Iceberg" book of the - seven to ten percent of the book should be in the text (ph) and the rest should be under the surface. And I think that's, kind of, bullshit. But I - but I like (pause) - I think it's kind of bullshit but, yet, is one of the books - it's a book that has a lot more going on than just the story. But the story, itself, really works too. (sighs) I don't know - this is why I did not do a graduate degree in English. (laughter)
THERAPIST: (laughter)
CLIENT: Well, one of the reasons that I'd rather - [00:26:01] I feel like my personal enjoyment of literature might be impaired by too much need to categorize it.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And I don't like post-modern (ph). (chuckles) I'm just not into it. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Yes, I don't think that's where - I don't think we should hang out there for very long. (inaudible) (pause [00:26:33] to 00:26:46) So I'm (ph) reading again because I feel like I missed a lot. (inaudible) see how it fits together more. [00:27:02] Then (ph) I didn't do a graduate degree in English because I thought it would be too easy. What was I thinking? (laughter)
THERAPIST: (laughter)
CLIENT: Same reason I almost didn't major in English. I didn't take any English classes until my senior year in college because I decided I wanted to be an - I wanted to teach English, or I wanted to teach and...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: ...English was the one thing that I was, absolutely, confident that I could do extraordinarily well. But I hadn't (ph) taken any classes [in it] (ph), in college. (laughter)
THERAPIST: I think it was about (ph) time.
CLIENT: Yes, so I did two classes in the summer; six classes one semester, six classes the next semester.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: And then I was done (ph). (laughter) [00:28:03] (pause)
THERAPIST: So you did that whole major in that year?
CLIENT: Yes, I was going to graduate a year early.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And decided not to.
THERAPIST: What was your other major?
CLIENT: (inaudible) It (ph) probably wasn't until about the second semester of my junior year that I realized that it's not that marketable. (laughter)
THERAPIST: (laughter)
CLIENT: So I decided English was the more marketable degree. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Yes. (chuckles) [00:29:01]
CLIENT: (pause)
THERAPIST: And you thought that graduating (ph) was, probably, too easy?
CLIENT: Yes. I mean, I know how to read a book. And, if I read a book, I know how to see what the author is doing in the book; I know how to see how the book is received in its context and how it functions with (ph) its context. I try to - I feel wired (ph). And, after that, it's just theory. And that's really interesting, on some level. But, like I said, I'm not (inaudible) as them.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I was more, then, but - I guess I just couldn't see - I just couldn't see it as an end, in itself, as a vocation. [00:30:12] But I really liked that book.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Yes. Yes, because they've got everything and it's literary. It's got that whole world but you also have the historical and the religious (ph) -
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: You know, all of these different ways of thinking about something, put together.
THERAPIST: Yes, sure.
CLIENT: But the literary is the only one that I've got a real gift for so - (pause) That's what I get for not having friends (ph) as a kid. [00:31:07] I mean, really. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: You think?
CLIENT: I do, actually. I mean, there have been studies that have indicated that the biggest factor in how verbally talented, or acute, a child is when they hit high school, is not what they read but the volume that they read. And I read all the time, like 10, 12 hours a day, every day, all the time. (pause) You know, I had really good training in high school. (inaudible) [00:32:03]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: (pause [00:32:06] to 00:32:27) It (ph) doesn't let me go. (sighs) (pause [00:32:32] to 00:33:45)
THERAPIST: What just (ph) happened there?
CLIENT: I just - why are we talking about that? [00:34:02] [It's like] (ph) I'm a little distracted and then I - but, no, I'm really not. (crying) I'm just hurting all the time. (pause)
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: (pause [00:34:22] to 00:34:39) (sighs) I spend a lot of time trying to turn away from it but that's not useful.
THERAPIST: You're turning your back on yourself, kind of?
CLIENT: Yes, this is the thing that's happening in my life right now; this is it (ph). [00:35:01] (sighs) (inaudible) I don't know that that's true. Because, by saying that, then I deny the possibility of anything else entering in and relieving this. (sighs) I can't figure it out.
THERAPIST: Yes. What's really clear is that you're hurting all the time. It doesn't matter if it (ph) looks that way, it doesn't matter if you're talking about something else. [00:36:01]
CLIENT: That's not, quite, true, though.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: I - it's like I don't notice for a while and then, I feel like I have been hurting all of this time. And that I haven't been noticing it. But I can't tell whether that is made up or not; whether that's healing. You know, whether I'm retrojecting it back and borrowing trouble, or whether I -
THERAPIST: Yes, so that makes me think of the grip on reality thing. You don't really know what you're experience is there.
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: (inaudible) sort of, fantasy that you've been hurting the whole time but it's unclear whether that's accurate or not.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Whether there's some reason that you're confabulating (ph) it that way, or like you're suppressing it the other way. [00:37:03]
CLIENT: Yes, I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yes, it sounds pretty terrifying.
CLIENT: (chuckles) I just don't know - I don't know what the right thing to do is. (pause) (sighs)
THERAPIST: The right thing to do about that (ph)?
CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: [It all] (ph)?
CLIENT: Yes. (inaudible) (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yes. [00:38:00]
CLIENT: (inaudible) I have discrete, very specific, opinions about what the right thing to do is, in some situations. And the whole -
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: It's not like (inaudible) (laughter)
THERAPIST: Right. Do you know, since a minute ago or whatever it was - a couple minutes ago, what, sort of, trigger instigated that sense that you had not been talking about what really mattered and how you actually, really, had (ph) been feeling the whole time?
CLIENT: I just thought, "Oh, God, this hurts so much."
THERAPIST: The thought just popped into your head?
CLIENT: (pause) [00:39:00]
THERAPIST: Can you think of (ph) what you were referring to?
CLIENT: No. I mean, I just sensed that (pause) - that, you know, reading and understanding literature is really - is my greatest talent. It's one of the - its, maybe, the only thing that I do better than anybody I've ever met. Or do easier, or whatever. And I just say, "Well, who cares? It's - that does not make you special." (chuckles) [00:40:02] - like, "And it doesn't do you any good." (pause [00:40:11] to 00:40:33) Yes, that's not (ph) the part of myself that I could hold onto, to say, "this is worthwhile". And I just say, "No, this isn't worthwhile. Let it go." [00:41:00]
THERAPIST: So the - (inaudible) feel that, as though, is that part (ph) going to save you. And if that's not going to make you special, in some particular (ph) way, it's worthless. And, I guess, that's what it feels like.
CLIENT: Yes. Yes, I (pause) I feel like I used it in conversation, as a way to make myself - to feel better about myself. And I don't like that. So it's like this thing that I used - that I had (ph) been used to saying, like, "Oh, here, I have value." I just despise myself more for doing that. [00:42:09]
THERAPIST: And so, with me, what kind of value were you demonstrating, exactly, a few minutes ago, in talking about it? Like I can imagine any number of sorts of values that might add. But, I guess, I wonder which ones you had in mind. Does that make sense?
CLIENT: I don't know. I think I was just doing it (ph) to comfort myself. You know, obviously, I want you to think I'm smart but - (chuckles) and I want - I want you to see that I do know how to recognize my good qualities, even if I don't actually acknowledge them or I can't [build them] (ph) to be the case. [00:43:07]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: I don't know why but -
THERAPIST: I think (ph) you're making it clear that, at some level, it's not like you have such a distorted view of yourself that you don't recognize anything good about (ph) yourself.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: (inaudible) and how (inaudible)
CLIENT: So I took part in this psychology experiment. I think I messed [with their data] (ph) a little bit, which makes me secretly very satisfied.
THERAPIST: (laughter)
CLIENT: (chuckles) So, part of - kind of, like a slide (ph) thing was on non-suicidal self-injury. And so they had you look at a lot of pictures and ideas that - people who cut are going to look at the pictures of cutting more.
THERAPIST: (inaudible) [00:44:03]
CLIENT: (laughter) I was a little disappointed. I'm like, "This is a stupid study." (inaudible) (chuckles) No, but it was actually fun. But I'm sure people - apparently, (inaudible) for something that's really understudied. So, okay, great. So, part of the slide (ph) thing with that, they had you view all of these images. And they timed how long you looked at the picture, or whatever. And then, they had you do an exercise that was supposed to boost your self-esteem. And then, they had you look at the images again. And so, it was like, "Tell me what are your good qualities? Talk about them. How have you exhibited (ph) them?" (laughter) And it just felt like so much worse about myself after that. (laughter)
THERAPIST: (laughter) (inaudible) [00:45:03]
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: But, actually, I think that makes a lot of sense.
CLIENT: That I should feel worse about myself?
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Yes, it made sense to me.
THERAPIST: Yes, and in fact -
CLIENT: That's why I thought it was a stupid study. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Yes, especially if they're studying people who self-injure. I...
CLIENT: I know, right?
THERAPIST: ...imagine that they would get a lot of - I wonder [how they picked you, actually.] (ph) In a way, were what they were looking for - I don't know. But my - one of my (inaudible) about what helped you, is ways you feel a little less alone and a little less alienated, with how you're really hurting. [00:46:13] And it seems like that study is designed to be somewhat alienating. I don't know. I don't know if they had this in mind. I mean, you're probably - my idea is that you're right. They were thinking, "We'll just talk to people, make them feel good about themselves, and then they'll act less like people who self-injure."
CLIENT: Yes, that was the exact opposite.
THERAPIST: (inaudible) Right.
CLIENT: (inaudible) that people would, then, have a buffer.
THERAPIST: Right. Right. And, yes, (inaudible) self-injure. What, actually, makes a difference is (ph) to feel less alone, is (ph) what hurts so much. And talking about things that are positive seems like bullshit. I mean, [maybe that's] (ph) a little too strong - [00:47:03]
CLIENT: No, it's more like there's this huge gap between what I can dispassionately observe in myself, and what I feel to be true about myself. And so, for me to talk about my good qualities is to widen that gap, not to bring it together.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Does that have anything to do with what you're saying?
THERAPIST: (inaudible) sort of related, yes. It alienates you from how you actually feel about yourself.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: [Maybe that's still different; I don't think we're saying the same thing.] (ph)
CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (chuckles) [00:48:01]
CLIENT: Although (inaudible) because the second time looking at the images, I'm more comfortable with looking at them, more comfortable with the study, feel more okay at looking at images that are disturbing, when I feel like people would expect to be disturbing more. So I can - I would think it would be more indicative of how - like what my natural inclination to do (ph) is, than anything else, just by virtue of doing it twice.
THERAPIST: So my guess is that affects (inaudible)
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: [That's like a cross-subject.] (ph)
CLIENT: Oh, okay.
THERAPIST: Like, because (ph) everybody is doing the experiment in the same order.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: That there will be a kind of - a habituation (ph) effect (inaudible) everybody. I'm not trying to defend the study...
CLIENT: Not at all. It's probably -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: It's probably fine. I'll get something out of it. [00:49:06] (inaudible)
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: (inaudible)
