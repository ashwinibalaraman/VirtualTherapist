BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: November 16, side two, track two, side two, track two, November 16.
PATIENT: Well, let's see. Where did we leave off last week?
COUNSELOR: I don't remember.
PATIENT: Ok. Well, we had an interesting week. Following last Tuesday night. I think when we left, both of us had felt very, very good last Tuesday evening. And, I don't know my wife, I don't know what brought it up. We started talking about money and I started yelling at her for the need to budget.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And a couple of hours later we, I really let her have it on the need to budget and manage money. And we went to visit friends. And while we were visiting our friends, we were drinking, and I don't know. We started talking about, I guess talking about drugs and my wife led that into alcohol. And started talking about problem drinking, drunken behavior and all that. 0:01:54.0
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: But then started to go from the general to the specific and lay it on me that she didn't like it when I drank. And she said because, "You used to be real nice when you drank and now you get ugly and mean." And I said, "Well, I get ugly and mean because every time I start to drink, you say, you're going to get ugly and mean and you harp on me and you just don't leave me alone. And anyway, my wife wouldn't drop it. She kept going. Just went, really dig at me. So we went home and it was about a half hour ride home. And we didn't talk all the way. And we went home. She didn't come to bed with me. And she slept on the couch and I slept on the bed. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And the next morning when we got up, it was a holiday so I didn't work. And we didn't talk for a while. And then we had an argument. Kind of a low key fight. And then we sat down and we had an excellent talk. We talked for about four or five hours.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And some of the things that I had already, I think some of the things I had mentioned to you last week and prior to that. You know feelings of resentment I had about the way in which we got married to begin with. Like I felt I was kinda trapped into marrying her in some ways, you know. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: I had never told her that before.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And I told her. And she wasn't surprised. She said, "Well, I knew that because I just felt it. I felt it all along." And we talked a great deal about feelings, you know. 0:04:18.9
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And interpreting each other's feelings. The fact that even though we live together, and have lived together for four years, often one's interpretation of the other's feelings is incorrect. It's been wrong. And so then we act erroneously based on a poor perception or a missed perception of what we thought the other was feeling or meaning by something. So since that time we've, I don't know, I think felt a little closer. I have. I think she has too. 0:05:07.2
COUNSELOR: I kinda sense maybe it's from your tone of voice that you're feeling kinda, is it somewhat down today or is it just quiet and mellow? 
PATIENT: With me?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, today. 
PATIENT: Oh, I'm tired as hell. I'm very tired. I imagine, yeah I think I feel a little mellower though. Yeah, I you know, like the anger that I felt a couple of weeks ago. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: I don't feel so angry.
COUNSELOR: I guess what I was responding to is you talked about your wife. And when you were talking about your fights and your arguments and about that night, it didn't kinda feel like it had the agitation that it had when you were talking about it before.
PATIENT: You mean the fight we had?
COUNSELOR: No. When you're talking about it now. 0:06:07.0
PATIENT: Right, right. That's true. I imagine because we resolved it the next day. It really bothered me at the time that she started picking at me. I couldn't understand why. And I thought, well, this has something to do with...
COUNSELOR: When you say that, when you say that picking on me, you smile. Why? I don't, I mean I don't understand, I don't get the connection. Maybe you don't realize you smile but when you said...
PATIENT: I guess, I guess I was, maybe the smile crossed my face when I was hunting for a choice of words to describe. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And the first word that popped into my mind was pimping on me. Which was a word that the kids I see use. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: But I felt very bad about that. And I thought well, that may have some relationship to the fact that just two hours before this I had been picking on her about managing money and budgeting. And I lectured. I lectured her. 
COUNSELOR: How do you feel about that? The way you were?
PATIENT: Well you mean in terms of the fact that I lectured her and everything?
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: I guess I have mixed feelings. I don't want to have to lecture her. It puts me into a very authoritarian kind of role which I don't like. And second, if I begin to lecture her, she turns me off. But I begin to lecture her because I feel she's already turned me off anyway. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Because she does. She just doesn't listen. 0:08:02.5
COUNSELOR: You mean, so it's kinda like, you kinda have, feel like you start to become and act the kind of way you don't want to act to kinda get through or something. 
PATIENT: Yeah. And..
COUNSELOR: I guess it's get through sharply in a way too.
PATIENT: Hmm?
COUNSELOR: It's also get through sharply. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Well, yeah it's kinda like weigh down on her. Almost like a father to a child.
COUNSELOR: Pimping on her?
PATIENT: No. You know like using your authority. The weight of your relationship and saying, "Now look here. Do this or do that. Or I'm going to do this." And my ultimatum was, "Or I'm going to get rid of the charge accounts and you won't have any more."
COUNSELOR: Um hmm..
PATIENT: And when you start doing that, when I start doing that with my wife, she becomes real cold.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Which enrages me. That makes me madder. So then I start really yelling about it. And of course she does get pissed off. But it's hard, she doesn't show that in a, I guess usual sort of reaction. She withdraws and just kind of becomes very passive aggressive toward me. Which makes me even angrier at her. 0:09:27.0
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kinda sense like, I sense it gets into a bad cycle or something. Or vicious cycle. 
PATIENT: Well..
COUNSELOR: Like you want to tell her something and you find yourself doing more and more intent to punish and hurt. 
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Her reaction kinda reinforces that. 
PATIENT: Yeah I think that's true. 
COUNSELOR: It kinda sounds like it builds both of you each build that kinda to force the other to do that too. Like your doing that leads her to not only react the way to what you're saying but then get on you later. 
PATIENT: Um hmm. So when she finally got on me later, I thought the fact that I had yelled at her earlier might have been the stimulus to get even with me. And to do it in front of somebody, you know.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:10:26.0
PATIENT: And I was really angry. That really made me mad. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: Because she, she set me up really. And it was kind of a set up where no matter what I said, I looked wrong. Really. It was, I felt like it was a real vicious, intentional set-up.
COUNSELOR: You could see your wife driving nails into you.
PATIENT: Hmm?
COUNSELOR: It was like you could really feel her driving nails into you. And you felt really helpless and that enraged you. 0:11:00.7
PATIENT: Well, I don't know if I'd say having nails driven into me. I don't feel like I was being martyred. 
COUNSELOR: No, I didn't mean, I guess I didn't mean to suggest the martyred aspect.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I just meant to suggest the pain aspect. 
PATIENT: Well it was more, it wasn't pain. Well, maybe pain. But it was shame, see that she was...
COUNSELOR: Putting you down.
PATIENT: Yeah. Well it was more than putting me down. I'll tell you. I imagine what it was. It wasn't putting me down in a usual kind of sense. We were visiting another couple. And they're very good friends of ours. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: And they often talk about very intimate, personal aspects of their marriage in front of us. And to us. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And we don't do that. And we don't really invite them to do that to us. We feel that that's something private between them. Because then they get into each other in front of us. You know, they dig each other in very personal ways. Which we both feel is demeaning to them. 
COUNSELOR: What do you mean dig? Do you mean dig in the like happy way? Or dig in a bad way?
PATIENT: Oh in a very bad way. They'll be very cruel to each other in way. Which we don't care for. 
COUNSELOR: Make you feel uncomfortable. 
PATIENT: Yeah. So this is precisely what she did to me that night. 0:12:28.7
COUNSELOR: She did to you what you hate when they do to you.
PATIENT: Yeah. No, well, right. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: We, well, we don't like it when they do that to each other. We don't want that done in front of us. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Ok, this fellow has recently developed an increasing drinking problem. To the point where now he drinks a great deal every night. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm..
PATIENT: And he's started knocking his wife around when he drinks. So my wife knew that when she brought up this thing about drinking, she had an ally. And when I was in the Navy, a week before I got separated from the Navy was Christmas. And it was my last working day in the Navy. And that coincided with a huge round of Christmas parties in the school that I taught at. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: So I got totally drunk. And my wife was at work. And I went over to get the car and she had some fellow in there drive me home. And I went home and I threw up all over the house. Bluh. And my wife came home about an hour later. Left work early because she was worried about me and came home. And I was in bed passed out. And she was so mad when she saw the house. She woke me up. And I said, "Leave me alone." And she continued to pimp me. And so I got up in a rage. And literally ripped the house apart. I broke the bedroom door in half. And tried to tear the refrigerator door off. And I grabbed her. But she was so scared. That's when I went on the refrigerator door and left her alone. Well, since that time she developed kind of a fear that if I drank too much I'd abuse her. And I'd be ugly. 0:14:29.4
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: So any time I drink at all she starts saying, "Now, I don't want you to be ugly. Slow down."
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And what happened that night was a big mixture of a lot of things besides drinking too much. I had mixed feelings about separating from the Army. I had friends I was leaving. And a lot of feelings I had came out that night. But they weren't related to her. They were related to another part of my life in a sense. But, so she set me up with this episode at the friends' house. She brought that up. And they know about that. But she didn't want to drop it. And she said, "I worry about you every time you drink you're going to get like that." And last Christmas I got real drunk and I ran the car into a pole. I was going real slow but I hit the pole anyway. One of those parking kind. And she said, "You've become so irrational." Well, her friend kinda turns on me. I should say our friend turned on me. 
COUNSELOR: I think you should say her friend the way you ...
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. At that moment, yeah. 0:15:43.7
COUNSELOR: It was kinda like there was this Holy alliance against you. 
PATIENT: Right. I felt like she was turning on me as she wishes she could turn on her husband. And I felt like I was being set up for the kill. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It's really like these two people are hovering over you kinda hammering at you. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Well, and I was, I slowly became more and more angry. Which was beautiful. Because as I got angry that justified their saying, "You get angry when you drink." 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Which really pissed me off. 
COUNSELOR: So it was like you were really caught in a bind because you really felt angry but almost felt like you couldn't get angry because they would say, "Ha! See what we mean?"
PATIENT: Well that's exactly what they were doing. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was kinda like you really felt helpless. Like you couldn't defend yourself in a way? Like..
PATIENT: Yeah, well. It was kinda like any means of defense had been taken away from me. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And so anyway, I felt very, I was very surprised my wife would do something like that. Because I felt it was very cold and deliberate that she had set me up.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And set me up in the way she did. In front of other people. And set up in such a way that I, generally if we argue or fight there's a means to resolution at the end. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: But this was something that couldn't be resolved. There was just no way you could resolve it. 0:17:20.5
COUNSELOR: Well let me, I 'm not sure about that. 
PATIENT: Well ok. There was no way we could resolve it there in the immediate situation. 
COUNSELOR: There, ok.
PATIENT: We resolved it the next day. When we sat down and finally talked. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. What did you say? What was the talk about? 
PATIENT: It wasn't about that at all. Well we talked a little bit about why she did it. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: But then we talked about everything else. The kind of things that I've been talking with you about. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well like right there, how do you feel that, why can, you can get angry but can't, I'm wondering if you, you see like when you get angry you lose your effectiveness. I mean like when someone's knocking do you get angry and you knock at them. And it's generally not that productive. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: It may be satisfying momentarily. 
PATIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: But in terms of better relationships, it's not that satisfying. I'm wondering though if you really feel like your wife's knocking away at you, can't you just kinda say to her, you know like, "You're making me feel bad. Do you see what you're doing?" Not in an accusatory angry way. But just showing her kinda in a, it's almost like trying to put aside the, instead of reacting out of anger, react out of kind of an understanding or something. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Well that's what we did Wednesday morning when we talked about it. And in the past we've done that. You know like when we have the Monday morning quarterback session about the fight we had yesterday. 0:18:57.7
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Then we can talk about it. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: But while the feelings are there, rather than simply recognize the feelings and say well, "I know you're angry. Why are you angry?" We don't, you know we fight it out. We let go of the anger first and then we're able to talk about why. 
COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like that procedure lets the things do their effect. 
PATIENT: Yeah, right, right. 
COUNSELOR: And then you try to patch it up.
PATIENT: Right. I suppose maybe I do that. Because you know, as I, I think I mentioned the end of the first time we talked that maybe some of the anger I have at her is often really transferred from my mother to her. 0:20:58.2
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And it's anger that I've never really, oh never really been able to ventilate to my satisfaction, you know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I felt like I had accomplished something with it. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you know I'm going to have to, as you've talked about how you feel when you feel angry I really have gotten the sense that there just is one hell of a moltenous pool of anger down in there somewhere. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: That comes out and it explodes or erupts sometimes. 
PATIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: There really is a lot of anger inside of you. 
PATIENT: You know I, I suppose one reason when I think about it. And that is, it's something I've thought about before but, I would imagine one reason I never really get the, you know when you release anger for example or other feelings I think if you release them meaningfully and you release them at whom they're directed. 0:23:50.3
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And they accept the feelings and recognize them then you feel a sense of communication and fulfillment as well as the release of the emotion. And I imagine I never really felt that sense of fulfillment. You know when like I would be angry at my mother and she would deny my feelings of anger. Deny their justification. 
COUNSELOR: So yeah. Is what you're saying like, "I really kinda felt that I had to keep them in in a way because I was never able really to establish that kind of communion where my feelings can be expressed and recognized."
PATIENT: Well it's..
COUNSELOR: And I can be accepted for my feelings. I mean I kinda sense that you ...
PATIENT: It's more than that. I guess, you know when you said that it occurred to me that maybe my mother was afraid of my feelings.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: You know, that she was afraid of them. And then and as a result really didn't, she didn't recognize them because she didn't want to deal with them. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And I think the relevance it really has now is because when my wife turns off, she does the same thing in a different way. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: She doesn't at least actively recognize my feelings. 
COUNSELOR: It's like you're not being recognized. 0:25:30.1
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: And I also detected something else in there too. When you were talking about your mother, maybe I thought I heard, I kinda detected a note of sadness like that like you as a person and your feelings to find you just kinda haven't been recognized. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, because the only time my mother will ever talk about feelings or recognize feelings at all is when she's drunk. And then she forgets about it the next day so it doesn't do you a damn bit of good, you know. It's kind of a blind thing. 
COUNSELOR: So it's, what you mean is like, in terms of establishing like you being able to express your feelings to your mother I guess, it's like something, an attitude like they fall on deaf ears in a way. And she doesn't express hers and..
PATIENT: Yeah, she expresses hers only when she's drunk. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it's kinda like there's an aloneness in there or something. 
PATIENT: Yeah, very much.
COUNSELOR: Just going around being lonely with people supposedly close to you but still really very distant from you. You're very distant from them. Kinda like you're alone with your feelings inside of your world but not with, you haven't been able to be with people with those feelings and be appreciated and responded to.
PATIENT: Um hmm. I think another reason that I never, I shouldn't say never because that's not true. But another reason I often withheld feelings, expression of feelings in a direct kind of manner was because like with my mother, I perceived her as very emotionally weak. 0:28:18.9
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And you know very, kinda like borderline. And I didn't want to push it because I felt that. And I also felt that because I was somebody who worked in an area of mental health, that it would be wrong of me. That it would be kinda like less than professional. I had my, the things I, because I recognized. 
COUNSELOR: You kinda recognized it could hurt her and felt a responsibility not to. 
PATIENT: Yeah. And at the same time that pissed me off even more because it was like, well, I have to deny my own feelings. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah I guess that's what I really..
PATIENT: Although it's not really denying them but I couldn't find another way to work them out, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like you never kinda, it's like it pissed you off and I guess it made you feel sad and lonely too because it's like a place that's supposedly a thing that should have been meaningful, a meaningful relationship, was kinda closed off to you to really express yourself and kinda be there with your feelings in that relationship and have them listen to you and respond to you. Kinda like you were really cut off. Shut out. 0:29:52.6
PATIENT: Um hmm.
Well, I was just thinking that you know when I would try to express feelings to my mother, she would kinda like you know like push, she would push away the feelings. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:32:24.2
PATIENT: And deny them and deny me an opportunity to express them in a meaningful way.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Which, I'm not sure, maybe it made me afraid of feelings. Maybe it, maybe it made me simply take them somewhere else for expression. But then when, I wonder if you know, the expression of my feelings like before I met my wife when I went with this, the one girl that I had the real dependent relationship with.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: I wonder if my feelings didn't somehow frighten her. That because it was so much feeling. 
COUNSELOR: It's like yeah, they had..
PATIENT: And overpowering.
COUNSELOR: They had been built up and accumulating. Like you accumulated this reservoir wanting to share those feelings and have them there for someone, someone there to listen to them. 0:33:35.3
PATIENT: Hmm. 
COUNSELOR: Then listen too much, that reservoir kinda was too much to drown her in a way.
PATIENT: Yeah and I'm wondering if there haven't' been times that I haven't really flooded my wife with so much feeling that it frightens her. Because I think that, despite the fact that my wife has a, you know kinda projects an image of being very self reliant and very independent, she really wants to be protected. And I wonder if when I really express my feelings about wanting to be protected too, that maybe that kinda frightened her. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Because I project the same kind of independent self reliant image. And I wonder if she didn't become a little bit afraid that I wasn't' going to take care of her the way she may have fantasized or desired. You know afraid that I couldn't be kinda omnipotent. Like a good daddy or something. 
COUNSELOR: Live up to an image. 0:34:59.4
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Well do you feel like, like that you communicated that to her? That which would frighten her? 
PATIENT: I think I may have. I remember once right after we first got married. It was on a New Year's Eve and we'd been on a party. And I got drunk.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And we left to go to visit, in fact the same friends at who's house we had the fight the other night. This was in California. I was stationed there and these people lived there at that time. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And we were on our way to their house. And when we went to the car we started talking about something. And I started talking about how much I loved her. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: And I think I had all, up until that time been very, you know not very demonstrative. Kinda like people used to say, "How long have you been married?" And we would say two months and people would say, "We thought you had been married three or four years." 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: It was that kind of, you know. Instead of being like honeymooners who faun over each other and everything, we never did. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:36:18.2
PATIENT: And, but that night I was really, I really told her how I felt and I think maybe it was frightening to her. Maybe it made her feel that I was so dependent upon her that it was kinda like she was afraid that she might do something to hurt me. 0:36:54.2
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Couldn't hold..
PATIENT: Well that she couldn't meet the responsibility that I was placing on her, you know. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And if that's true I imagine she might come to resent it too. Because it would be a lot of responsibility. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And I imagine I really have placed that on her. 
COUNSELOR: It sounds like when you talk about it, it's like that you really see but that you've got a hell of a lot of needs and feelings inside of you that is a big responsibility. You don't know if anyone could handle them.
PATIENT: Maybe. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I'm certainly hearing, kinda like you're felt very lonely but you felt very sad and lonely because no one's ever really been there to handle them. And you won't hear them. 
PATIENT: Um hmm. I wonder too, you know, I often will find myself, I told you like when I went to the demonstration and like this can happen anytime. I can be with a group of people that I don't know. And the group can be from one to a thousand. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And I find myself, you know kinda like fantasizing relationships with different girls for example based on how they appear to me. I wonder if sometimes I'm doing that because I feel it takes a lot of people to meet my needs. And I'm looking at different kinds of people to help me meet different needs. 0:38:55.8
COUNSELOR: I really get a sense from what you're saying that is, like right now I really, "I do feel alone because it's like I still don't have the kind of person who I feel like I can share myself with and that can meet my needs too." 
PATIENT: Yeah, I think that's, I think I feel that way. 
COUNSELOR: I guess the matter of fact of it is it's like you're living your life with your wife and people but it's, but you know it's with people, it's not a real meaningful oneness. I guess it's kind of a loneliness.
PATIENT: Yeah. It's like my wife and I lately have noticed that we have a tendency to, and it's been a recent tendency, to start doing a lot of things with a lot of people. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Going places with people. Visiting a lot. Having people over a lot.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: So much so that that isn't even meaningful any more, you know. But we wonder why we've been doing it. It's kinda like if we do that we don't have to be alone and intimate with one another. We can escape our feelings.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Or the feelings that we are going to be left with if the two of us are alone in a room. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And we talk about the fact that we both feel that we should quit spending so much time with other people. And use that time to be alone with each other doing something or just being together. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And yet we still don't do that. We talk about the need to do it but we don't do it. 0:41:20.5
COUNSELOR: It's like in a way you feel like with your wife you talk about wanting that kind of intimacy that you're missing but it's like you don't do it or have it with her. And you don't structure your life so to try to work towards having it in a way. 
PATIENT: Um hmm. Yeah and at the same time I, when I think about it, even though like when we'll talk about that and I feel the need to be alone with her more, and at the same time, at least half of the time I'll be the one who will suggest something that doesn't leave us alone. 
COUNSELOR: Why? Is it because you're afraid of if you're alone it's not going to be the way you'd really like it to be like?
PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know what it is. But you know I, I think that often when I go to bed at night and like we'll get into bed and I sense kind of a feeling of relief that we didn't have to, I don't know. Kind of like a feeling of relief that we didn't confront whatever it is we should have confronted. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And at the same time a feeling of loss and guilt that we didn't try. 0:43:31.5
COUNSELOR: It's kinda like you see, like the times you spend..
PATIENT: And because I'm so lonely, you know. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. The times you spend together, it's like as every day goes by it's like you haven't confronted it and found it with your wife or, and it's like you're still lonely.
PATIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: And kinda see the days going by. Your feeling is torn because you want to confront it but yet don't or are scared about it. And that effect of you always like you see the time goes by and you're still where you are and still missing. Still missing really being able to be with someone in a meaningful, communal way. 0:44:16.6
PATIENT: I can't think of anything more to say right now. I just feel kind of empty. 0:46:29.6
COUNSELOR: What do you mean empty?
PATIENT: I don't know. 
COUNSELOR: I sense kind of like the more you've talked, am I right like the, some of that sadness came up and alone. The feeling of sadness with that loneliness?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think the more we talked about it, the more I feel. 
COUNSELOR: And what do you feel now? 
PATIENT: Hmm?
COUNSELOR: And what do you feel now? 
PATIENT: I'm kind of sad, empty. 
COUNSELOR: I see. I mean you kinda get a sense of what your life is, it feels kinda empty and sadness for the things you want and just..
PATIENT: Well, I don't know. It's hard for me to say that now. I mean right at this given moment because I'm very tired. And I know that when I'm tired I get kinda depressed, you know overall. And so I think the way I feel physically right now would color anything I feel emotionally too.
COUNSELOR: I kinda hear, I kinda hear what you're saying is, "I have this feeling of sadness but I'm not sure how much I trust it or my coloring it. 
PATIENT: Yeah, uh huh. I mean because I don't always feel lonely or empty. It's not a feeling that pervades me, you know. 0:48:13.1
COUNSELOR: No, but..
PATIENT: But I do feel that right now. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I guess kinda what I was responding to was, I felt like you were saying you had been kinda trying to say well, I mean because I guess I really sense that feeling in you. I guess what I was responding to was when you (inaudible at 0:48:35.6). I kinda got the sense that you were shoving it somewhere. Do you see what I mean?
PATIENT: That's why I came here to begin with. Yeah. Because I do. 
COUNSELOR: It's like it felt real but then, "Well maybe it's not so real because I'm tired."
PATIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: How does that hit you?
PATIENT: Well yeah, I can see. I feel like it kinda points out another way I've been doing it. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Like denying the feeling, you know like denying that I should allow myself to feel the feeling by justifying it in some way or qualifying the feeling. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah because I really did sense as you were talking I mean, I sensed it especially when you weren't talking. And you were kinda sitting there so like tasting in a way that you really did feel sad. A very quiet soft kind of despair, I guess. It's like that. Empty. 
PATIENT: Well, that's today. There are other days when I rage with despair. 0:50:24.8
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: You know, I talked about anger and voicing all of that. And it occurs to me that maybe one, another reason that I've been reluctant in some ways to release anger was because it has the effect of making people defensive and pushing them further and further back.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And my anger was about the fact that they were too far back to begin with.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like you don't want them to be far back. You want them to be able to be there and for you just to be with them. And for them to be with you. 0:51:58.9
PATIENT: I don't know where to go from here. 0:55:13.7
COUNSELOR: Feeling kinda empty and sad too? Where are you? What are you feeling?
PATIENT: Well I had, I was sitting here thinking, I had all feelings of anger about certain things I was thinking about and you know unhappiness about other things. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. You mean like you would think about things and get angry and then some things go through you mind and you feel unhappy? 
PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. The things that were going through my mind were just kind of flashing through.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And I don't know. I really don't know why some of those things flashed through my mind anyway. 0:56:18.1
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: I'm smiling because the word Regatzo's Restaurant just, that was one of the things that flashed through. I have no idea why. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah I had the sense as you sat there it was kinda like I could see things going through your mind and just kinda sense something just provoked kinds of feelings in you. Sad feelings. Angry feelings. 
PATIENT: Um hmm. And I guess really with all of them, you know, I could have both feelings of sadness and anger. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. What do you feel about that? 
PATIENT: Hmm? 
COUNSELOR: What do you feel about that? 
PATIENT: About why I get angry about the fact that the things would be unresolved. Or sad because they're unresolved. And they make me angry because they're unresolved. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like, I sense that you're kinda sadness, your sense of sadness about the things you feel sad about, the things you're missing. It's like the sadness is very temporary. And like the sadness inside of you turns to, over what you don't have turns to anger and resentment about not having them. It's kinda like the sadness is there but it just becomes anger. Is that what you're saying? 0:58:09.4
PATIENT: It might be. I guess I feel the anger because it, like a given situation turned out unhappy or sad instead of happy.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: And I guess I feel anger about it because I suppose I feel that it could have been different. Which makes me even angrier because then when I think about it I think about it on a different level.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then generally I'll come up with a conclusion, well it couldn't have been any different given that set of circumstances. But that still doesn't meet my emotional need to, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. The emotional need I guess is really wanting to have had them different.
PATIENT: Is what?
COUNSELOR: Really wanting to have had them different. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: And things flash through your mind and they're not different. There's sadness and anger over it. Which you missed, don't have. Our time is up.
PATIENT: Ok. 0:59:38.1
