<b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b>
CLIENT: Um, oh anyway, hi.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: So, oh okay, so what – I should've asked you this before.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: So I'm trying to get like a feeling on your method.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So I notice you don't give a lot of feedback.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And I was just wondering kind of, if you could give me kind of like an overview of your method I guess?
THERAPIST: Sure, sure, and I'm happy. If you ever want more feedback I can certainly give it to you.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But what I typically do, especially as we're getting to know each other is [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Just listen.
THERAPIST: ... really, yeah, hopefully do a little bit more than that,
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: ... but mostly listen and just try to sort of frame what you're saying in a particular way.
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: I mean that's because what I try to be doing [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ... from the start, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ... but if you need more of that that's great.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But you know I feel like, especially with you and what you're coming with for right now, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: ... is that it sounds like, first of all, you said I think at the second session that actually just expressing what's going on inside of you was very helpful. [00:01:01]
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: Not to say that's all of what we do [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: ... but sort of I was taking your lead on that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And, yeah, and mostly I like to, you know I talk when I feel like I have something important to say.
CLIENT: Mm.
THERAPIST: So right now I'm sort of taking a lot in.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But if there are particular things that you want more feedback about [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: ... you can feel free to let me know that.
CLIENT: Okay. I, um, I was just thinking [all around this] (ph) again. I am, I think, I think a person who talks a lot. It's like my girlfriends that were in town and I was talking and I was like "I started going to see somebody" and blah, blah, blah, blah. And they were asking like "well does she tell you, like what does she ...", and I was just saying like, "No, I work a lot out! I'm like, "[inaudible at 0:01:40] (chuckling) if feels." And I think that for me as a person it actually is good, since I, I'm a person who really looks for outside kind of like, and I think it's good anyway.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I thought they had a lot of questions and [another view] (ph) and I start thinking like, oh yeah, but I really don't.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Anyway.
THERAPIST: What were your thoughts about asking for a lot of [overlapping voices] [00:02:01]
CLIENT: Well like I, um, so in therapy before at, when I went in high school, um, the woman I worked with before, she gave a, like she talked a lot and her, (chuckling) really gave me a l-, and I don't know if that was – it, it was good because I felt better and the experience was positive. So I don't know if like her style was good or bad, I just know that it was different. And that, um, and that her situation growing up was similar to mine, and she, that felt a little unprofessional that she shared that much with me now in retrospect.
But, um, but so it was like a way of, I think, her way of kind of making me feel better and not so like – I had a lot of feelings of like this is never going, I'm going to be stuck with this forever, in this position of, um, in this family. And she would, I think, try to – anyway, so that was really different. [00:03:04]
And then when I was, when my parents got separated, I don't remember what time, but my mom took us to see a psychiatrist, with my two brothers, she and I, and that was a very different experience as well. And they did a lot of insinuating, they asked if my dad sexually abused me, and asked like [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... very blunt questions that I didn't, that I, I don't feel like I led into but were kind of like the ideas kind of – I wasn't at all (chuckling), like nothing like that.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But, um, that was a very different experience as well, and so I'm just seeing a lot of different experiences kind of.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And that experience, I don't think it actually was very good. But (chuckling), um, they, uh, that experience was different, too, because it was two people working together, it was a man and a woman, so that was very interesting, that was different. I don't remember very much about it, I was young. But, anyway, so I just wanted to ask so that I [overlapping voices] [00:04:10]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... know, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... because I think then I (chuckling), I take it per-, you know what I mean? It's hard but then I'd start thinking, I don't know, I start taking things personally (chuckling).
THERAPIST: How do you mean? Taking things personally how?
CLIENT: Uh, like I start thinking that there's something with me that like is a particular, I start thinking like, well I don't even know what I was thinking. That it was, I don't know. I don't even really know anymore. I do know that I had some (chuckling) thought about that this weekend but I can't place it anywhere.
THERAPIST: Hmm, well give it a try and let's see if we could go with that a little bit, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: ... because I think that that might be important. [00:04:56]
CLIENT: Uh-huh. I, um I guess I think that like if there's not a lot of feedback then it's because blah (ph) gives me, for me, it, it gives me more of a sense of security that I'm kind of on the right track and doing kind of the right thing.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: That's kind of where I got with it this weekend, at least when I was thinking about it.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And so it's like well, um, you know that's probably a good thing and that I'm probably not so far off in left field that you know I can kind of direct myself for myself well enough.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So I start to think like that. But then it's like well but she said I should be coming twice a week [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ... and so I must be (chuckling) like really laughing (ph) and he's like, um, you know and my girlfriends are going all like "yeah, you're kind of crazy" (chuckling) but not like Cameron. [00:06:06]
THERAPIST: Mm, m-hmm.
CLIENT: But they've known me forever. They know that I'm, um, in a much better place now but, um, they've kind of forgiven me a little quick, "yeah, you'll (chuckling) probably use some, some work".
THERAPIST: The recommendation or comment I made, and I think it was the first or second session here, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ... it sounds like it really stuck with you.
CLIENT: It did because it was so surprising.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: Um, so I, I also, um, you know I've been feeling a lot better, but like I also, I've been feeling a lot worse in moments.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So on Tuesday I felt worse than I've felt in a month. I was just, and like a lot of it was going, stuff going on with my brother, he was just so upset. I was just, I had to go upstairs during work at one point and just call Chris and cry. [00:07:05]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I thought like why (chuckling) is this going on? Like I did, I – a lot of my anxiety has been relieved lately, and I have moments where they're anxious but, for the most part, it's not really been having the overwhelming feelings of anxiety and being tense. That, for the most part, is kind of, it comes at points, but it's mostly, it's not like it was, where it was just this thing I wore all the time.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Instead, I've been having moments of just being very sad.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And I don't know if that's normal or if it's just because of stuff going on with me or, um, or if it's because you know I started to come here and started to really try to work through things. I don't know what it is, but I do know that like on Monday and Tuesday I, granted I'd had a tough weekend at home with my family, but I came home and I was like I just I was so sad. [00:08:15]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So I don't know, I didn't, I couldn't like place where all that was coming from, but it's fine, I mean after those few days I felt great, so who knows really.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Unfortunately I've not been exercising as regularly and so I think that, too, is, was a way for me – it just got cold and I usually take the baby to run and I don't want to take her out with me. Anyway, so I haven't been exercising and I think that I need to get back into that and I think that'll help with some of my, at least it just helps me to kind of like slush stuff for at least a little bit [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Mm, m-hmm.
CLIENT: ... and just feel better about myself.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Anyway, [overlapping voices] [00:09:02]
THERAPIST: Well it seemed like my recommendation about coming twice a week was related in your mind to something being really wrong with you.
CLIENT: Yeah, oh definitely, definitely (chuckling). I thought well that just, there you go, like yep (chuckling), there is definitely something wrong.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: People who, I mean that obviously everything's not cheery, otherwise I wouldn't be here, but it's like, okay, people who are just a little bit sad don't need to come talk to somebody twice a week. People who, who just have a little touch of the worries don't need to come (chuckling) talk to somebody or go see. Like there must be something that you really need to work on. So that felt like woo (chuckling)! [00:09:55]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, and I think that there is, and I guess that that's just, it was harder for me to have somebody outside, from a professional setting, tell me that.
THERAPIST: I was, that was my next question, whether it was sort of surprising, because it wasn't part of your experience verses something that you felt, too, but someone outside confirming [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ... it felt?
CLIENT: M-hmm, yeah.
THERAPIST: Maybe that's a little too much feedback I was giving you?
CLIENT: No (chuckling), it's not. It's just, um, hmm, I really hold onto certain things [within my memory] (ph), say like to hold, whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, I kind of grab onto it and that becomes kind of my track, if that makes any sense.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So, if I get, if I hear something that makes me feel like I'm doing great, then I hold onto that and I kind of run with it. [00:11:06]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And then if I feel like I hear something that confirms you know my doubts about myself, then I hold onto that and kind of sink with it.
THERAPIST: Mm, m-hmm.
CLIENT: So, uh, I mean I don't think that's terribly uncommon, but I think I do take external cues much more seriously than some people do [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... and really hold onto them.
THERAPIST: Well I think, in part, it's very much the product of you know really having lived in a very traumatic environment. I mean that's what people in trauma do. You need to be so sensitized to your environment all the time, your antenna needs to be up all the time.
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: And so I very much think that that, at least in part, is a product of your experiences. [00:11:57]
CLIENT: Yeah, I think so, too. I think that I also am just a person who, um, I th-, I take what's going on around me and I just kind of like really relate to it. I kind of – I don't know why I haven't mentioned this before, Chris, my husband, has OCD and he manages it on his own now, without – I don't get involved.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: There used to be a lot, when we first got together, um, of me. You know he has a lot (ph), it's a, his mom has it and it's, it's something that exists in his family. Um, he didn't know that until he was older but, anyway, he started to see somebody before we got married. Because when we got engaged, um, it was kind of, not out of control but it was at a level that I was not comfortable with. And so I asked, before we got married, if he would go see somebody about it because I felt like it wasn't something I was comfortable living with at that level. I wanted it to like be better for both of us. [00:13:05]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Anyway, when he told me about his OCD I feel it – I had never had anxiety before. I'd had depression but the feeling of an anxiety attack and panic attack, for an, um, for just nothing, I couldn't relate to. I didn't understand it. I didn't grasp it. And I almost feel like, I don't know if this is even pa-, but I feel like after I l-, living with him and after trying to really grasp what he was going through, I almost feel like I took so much of that on I started to, I don't know, I don't relate to the OCD tendencies but I did start to really relate to his anxiety [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... and I hadn't experienced it before. And I just don't know if that's just because of who I am as a person and I really try to like to relate to or take on. Like I'll be talking to somebody (chuckling) from the s-, with a southern accent, and I'll hear myself start to talk [overlapping voices] [00:14:07]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ... with an acct-, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... do you know what I mean? I start to just kind of mimic what's going on around me a little bit. And so I don't know, with his OCD, if that has affected me as well, but, um, yeah, I don't, I don't really know but I've been kind of curious. And I'm trying to, like for me, I know that I've always, secretly, in the back of my head, felt like his OCD was kind of a weakness, which is really stupid because I have my own mental stuff going on, but I know I've always seen it and thought like get a grip. "Like I know this is so real for you but get a grip. You aren't ..." [00:14:51]
I mean when he first told me about the OCD in the first – I was, I think, the first person he ever really told about it. And so I was, he, checking his text messages to make sure he wasn't sending anything terrible. I was checking every single text message. And every time he got off a phone call he would say to me, "Is that okay?" And it, it just became so part of our daily routine that he couldn't do anything without me telling him like "it was fine, it's fine".
And then he went just like to see somebody and I came with him. And the person he was seeing said like "you're going to have to taper this". You know she gave us, I think, like a couple of days and I could do maybe three and then I'd have to stop. And since then I don't check anything. I don't, I'm not there to tell him things are okay. And so since then it's gotten better for him, it's gotten better for me, but I'd still have these lingering – I just don't know.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I don't know if it was, what it was.
THERAPIST: Okay. You felt like that you had to manage his anxiety? [00:15:57]
CLIENT: M-hmm. Yeah, I have. I felt like you know obviously the need to take care of him and he really relied on me because of that to do that. But I don't, I don't know if, in trying to relate to his anxiety, I kind of made myself (slight chuckle) anxious.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So that's – I don't know, anyway. Yeah, we probably shouldn't have children (chuckling). We probably shouldn't reproduce, with our [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Why do you say that?
CLIENT: It's a big fear of mine actually, um, just because of, um, part of me thinks it's really irresponsible, knowing everything that I am bringing to the table genetically and then everything he's in this all mental health. [00:16:52]
You know like on his side of the family, OCD is kind of prevalent on his mom's side, um, and his brother has, has dealt with some mental health issues his whole life, and on my side of the family there's clearly addiction of depression, anxiety issues. And I think coming to, two people knowing that and coming together to have a family, well that sometimes I think like that's just irresponsible. What are we doing to our future children? Like this is such a bad idea.
So I don't know. [I hope all the time it's things that it's] (ph) – I don't know. Obviously I can't help the person that I fell in love with and ended up marrying, but I do, I do get really concerned. And I'm so, you know if we do end up having a family what that means for our kids really freaks me out. [00:18:00]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: Well, um, and then I don't know if I will be, you know I go back and forth and I'm like well you'll, you're just aware of it and you know we don't pick up signs. Chris' mom didn't pick up signs of his OCD. She didn't know until he you know said something. And, and you know with my mom, with us she always just told us growing up "you guys are alcoholics, you should know that, that's what you'd, that's in your genes, in your DNA", and that didn't really do anything to positively affect any of us. So, um, I just don't know.
I get really worried because it's the thing I've always wanted the most, the thing I know I'm going to be very good at and, and then it's the thing that I kind of just, it's just what I want. I just want to have a family and I want to be this great mom and I want to you know have this lovely home that I've created. And I think well but if I'm doing that the risk of my future kids' sanity (chuckling) you know or what, mental wellbeing, I don't know maybe we should adopt. [00:19:15]
THERAPIST: Well you're not only talking about your kids but you're talking about yourself and feeling that there's not only something really wrong with you but somehow hardwired and incurable.
CLIENT: Oh yeah. I mean that's, to me, goes without saying. Like this is something that's a part of me, this is who I am, this is my makeup and I will pass it along.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Most likely. I, I hope I don't. I really do hope I don't but. Um, I mean that was also part of the reason that I started coming here was because I don't want to just, you know if we do, in the next few years, start to have a family, I don't want to be a person who's unstable and has babies. I just, I would like to have a better grasp on things. I want to feel better about myself. I want to be more secure. I want to be, you know I don't want to be this unhappy person. [00:20:25]
THERAPIST: I mean you're terrified of replicating your experience and somewhat convinced that you could.
CLIENT: If I don't, if I don't, if I'm not conscious of it and if I'm not, um, if I'm not actively taking steps not to, do you know what I mean? I do know that I have the ability to just stop caring and be not a very good person. And so I do, yeah, I do think that if I'm not conscious of it and if I'm not making steps to be better, that I can very easily be a terrible parent and I could very easily be a terrible wife and terrible friend and, um, a lot of things that really scare me. [00:21:22]
THERAPIST: And what would you be doing as a terrible wife or terrible parent?
CLIENT: I'd be an asshole (chuckling). I would just be somebody who is self-absorbed, self-righteous, depressed. Um, you know I think that if the depression is the biggest one, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... I think that a person who is depressed and who doesn't love or care about themselves doesn't really have an ability to love and take care of other people, especially the people that they love the most because those are the ones that they generally treat like garbage, at least in my experience. [00:21:56]
And I know just me and my dad, I mean his mom before him, and I mean I point to either my own mom, I just don't think that people who are, who are happy, that who, who aren't happy can really – I think the first people that affects are your, your spouse and your children and I don't want to be that person.
THERAPIST: M-hmm, mm.
CLIENT: So that's kind of my goal and like I've well been looking for a lot of things that won't make me that person.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And I, so far it's going pretty well (chuckling).
THERAPIST: But you're afraid?
CLIENT: Yeah and I don't think that'll ever go away, but at the same time, I don't know if I want that to go away. I don't want to just (sniffing) – you know getting too comfortable and too self-assured can also be a dangerous thing because then you're just high on yourself. [00:23:03]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: For me, like I always see it as this fine line between, I don't know, I guess, um, being self-assured and being self-righteous and kind of like my or the highway and I'm always right. And, and you know there's that and then there's you know being confident enough in yourself to know when like things, when you know when things are right and that you're okay and that – I don't know if I'm, I'm not verbalizing this very well. I guess I was thinking only in an argument type of setting. But I guess to me that's kind of (slight chuckle) every setting I grew up with. [00:24:05]
But anyway, so I think that it – I just don't want to be a person who like (thumping table with every word and deepening voice) goes around as the king [overlapping voices] [00:24:11]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... rather than a person who is just confident and like okay with themselves but doesn't need to have this need to push everything onto other people.
THERAPIST: And do you feel like if you didn't monitor yourself that you would be like that?
CLIENT: M-hmm, yeah. I think that I could trick myself into thinking that, um, into thinking that if I am – I don't know. I feel like I could trick myself into thinking that I was right, and that would be good but not necessarily being happy. I think that if I'm first happy, then, then everything else doesn't really matter. [00:25:04]
My girlfriends were all having a discussion over the weekend about arguments that they get into with their significant others. And they were all saying how, well it's a few of them were saying "I have to be right; I'm always right; I'm always, in my argument with my boyfriend, husband, whatever, I have to be right." And I think I'm always wrong. I mean I'm just always wrong. I know that about (chuckling).
And I don't know that I'm always wrong. I don't mean it like that. But for me in my relationship, I just kind of, in all relationships, friendships, my relationships with my siblings, Chris, if we have an argument, my immediate go-to is like "all right fine, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and so I'm sorry". I try to backtrack and then I'd try to, um, like "okay, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, I did, I, that was terrible of me, I'm so sorry". [00:26:00]
And I'd rather just get to a place – I don't want to be right all the time. I'd rather be in a place where it's like "no, I just disagree with you".
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: "You know you think that, I think this." It's I don't need to be right but I also don't always want to be wrong.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And so I've been trying to work on that and that act-, I mean I do feel more confident in that. Um, I don't fe-, I don't feel the desire as much, at least in the last week (chuckling), to just say like "okay, okay, okay, okay, okay". Like what do I need to say right now for this to be over with?
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Because that's my feeling all the time.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Okay but how do I make this over? Just like I'll say whatever and let's just be done.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And I don't want to, I don't think that that's – Chris has also [written a lot but] (ph), but my, my most common like tiffs are obviously going to be with Chris. [00:27:00]
He's also in law school (slight chuckle), and just Chris's personality, in general, is one of very like (deepening voice) "well I have all these facts and I'm going to tell you why this is this and this", and I don't, I just don't think that way and I don't like, I don't keep a backlog of everything that's ever happened between the two of us ever. And so a lot of times I get bombarded with all these facts and this timeline and (deepening voice) "at 8:30 last Wednesday you said this". And I just think a lot of times like "okay, I guess, you're right, sure, fine, you win", [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... but now what do I say to make it feel (ph) that.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But, um, I don't really feel like that and, I don't know. Yesterday we got into a little, a little quick tiff, and he keeps (slight chuckling) – he's trying to lose weight for these job interviews 'cause he's got like a good 15 pounds to lose, and so he'll go exercise and then he's always saying like (deepening voice) "I'm going to make a huge bowl of pasta" (slight chuckle).
And then I'm saying like, "You're a living contradiction. What are you doing? You just told me earlier this morning you're gonna to lose all this weight for this job interview and you're, you know you're going for a run, and then you're saying (deepening voice) 'I'm going to make a huge bowl of pasta'". It's like, he's like "I can eat whatever I want and lose weight". I said, "No you can't. You say that all the time but you don't. Just either stop talking about how you're trying to lose weight or actually do it."
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And, um, he like, we were on a walk together and he pouted and said like "this isn't fun anymore, I don't want to go", "well I'm gonna keep walking 'cause I'm having fun (slight chuckle) on my walk" [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... and so I kept on the walk. And my initial inclination was like oh my god I have to call him to go on to apologize. I did have to explain that I do want to still hear about him trying to be healthy and trying to take care of himself, I needed to explain that, but I don't think I was wrong. I don't think that he can – and so I didn't – you know I did explain like, "Listen I just want to make sure that you know that, 'cause I mean I care about it and I care about you being healthy, but I don't think I was wrong (ph). I think that if you're actually going to take care of yourself then actually do it. Don't take care of yourself in one arena and then not in another." [00:29:17]
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: And that we kind of just moved on and got over it, it wasn't a big deal. But usually in those circumstances I'm the first to be like put it all back in like, "No, no, it's okay. I'll make the pasta for you." Like why don't I just like, like let me, I don't know. That sounded really stupid but.
THERAPIST: Well it seems like in your wanting to take it back it's something like by putting it out there you've done something wrong [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ... that you need to then undo.
CLIENT: Yeah, I have to undo it and I have to make sure they know. Like they obviously know I'm wrong and I have to make sure that they know that I know I'm wrong, too. Like "don't worry, I know that was me, I know I'm a jerk" like "I'm sorry for being you know the jerk here". [00:30:01]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Mm, you know and with my argument with my brother after last week, he called me back and he said he wanted to talk about it.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And we weren't getting anywhere because neither of us was really budging. And it was new, because normally I say "you know all right, it was a great overreaction and I'm sorry, and I won't do it again".
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But I didn't do it, and I asked him you know how he would feel if he was in my position and a lot of these questions that he isn't really used to from me, and with his no movement I said, "You know all right, well I think we've, there's nowhere else to go from here, like I guess let's just be over it. I'm over it if you're over it. Let's just move on." [00:30:57]
And I know that that, for that particular situation, that's not really the best because I'm not over it. I'm not over his drinking. I'm over that one experience but I also don't want to burn a bridge with him with that subject so much that if he does ever feel like he needs somebody to talk to he can't come back to me. But just for my experience alone in the situation, I was happy to keep standing my ground and to not just immediately apologize. But I did also want to move on and so that was still accomplished, so I was happy about that.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I just don't [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: You looked really sad when you were talking about your brother.
CLIENT: Oh yeah, well that doesn't go away.
THERAPIST: [I know] (ph).
CLIENT: Um.
THERAPIST: It's almost like your brother is what you fear becoming. [00:31:54]
CLIENT: Hmm. He is what I'm scared of. I'm afraid of a lot of stuff with him. Um, I don't know what I'm afraid of exactly about my brother. I mean I'm afraid of, for him. I think that it's so close. He and I are, he and I are so close. He and I have s-, a lot of similarities, and I think like oh my god I could've just as easily, I could just be as bad off and I could, I can see myself like getting there really quickly.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I could get to where he is really quickly I think.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And so that makes me nervous. Um, but mostly I'm just afraid for him. I don't want him to be sad, I don't want him to be lonely, and I think that he's going down a path of being sad and lonely.
THERAPIST: M-hmm, mm.
CLIENT: So that really bums me out (sniffing).
THERAPIST: And you're worried there's nothing that you can do to stop it. [00:32:58]
CLIENT: No. Because I worry that, um, if I'm the one who says anything, you know so I think like you're going down this path, like pump the brakes, I mean come on, bring it back. That's my thought because then it's like boy you're just like bring yourself down this path of being sad and alone and isolating yourself just like Dad.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And so it's like all right, well quickly say something to him before he does it.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But then my fear also is like, well don't say something to him, because then you're not there to protect him from being sad and lonely because he's just going to push you away you know. And so, um, I do, I don't know, I have a lot of back and forth about it. And there's not a right answer. There's nothing right for me to do. [00:34:02]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: That's very scary for me and very [inaudible]. I like a right answer (chuckling).
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I like something to hold on to.
THERAPIST: Well that's how you started out by talking about [inaudible]. It sounded like part of the feedback was for going down the right path with (ph) the wrong path.
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: Do you think there is something that makes you anxious about feeling like you're not getting feedback?
CLIENT: Mm, yeah, definitely. I don't know what it is though. Um, yeah, I, I do. I mean it's well that I need external reassurance. I need somebody to tell me that, I need somebody to tell me that you know this talk looks good. I need somebody to tell me that like, you know I need somebody to tell me that what I'm doing is good [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ... and right, so that's a problem. But that's what I was saying to my girlfriends over the weekend, I think it's not necessarily a bad thing. I think that I have to start being the person to tell myself that some things are good and things are right and that you're okay and that you're right and that what you're doing is okay, even if it's not right.
It doesn't always have to be right and it doesn't always have to be the right way, as long as it's – but that's his way, too, actually (slight chuckle) now that I'm saying it out, that's his way, too. Because it's like we all know ho-, it should be the right way. It should be the right way because otherwise (whispering) you're so crazy. Like don't be crazy (chuckling).
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: That's what it all comes back to is like, don't be a crazy person. So it's just you know.
THERAPIST: This is the right way keeps you sane? [00:35:52]
CLIENT: M-hmm. Yeah. Um, I don't know. Yeah. I just I do think that I just want to be a person who doesn't need other people to tell them that everything's okay, but that what I'm doing is okay and good. Because I think that that's, I mean that's obviously just, I'm just insecure, not secure in myself, because if I was secure in myself I wouldn't need that. And so I'm hoping that as I become more confident that desire will be less and less. Um, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Well everybody, at some point, needs people to tell them that what they're doing is okay, and you never got that. [00:36:53]
CLIENT: No, I never got that. Well I also just, I do think that we all – I hate this – so they're you know like – I was reading this kind of like funny article about like, not even funny, it was just on a website but it's supposed to be like kitschy like funny. I thought like, why are we always comparing ourselves to other people, stuck with me. And then I, and I was like yeah, I always compare myself to other people, I should stop doing that. And then I realized that's what we're all doing. That's what, that's just kind of what sight is and if we weren't doing that then we'd all probably be sitting at home eating Ben and Jerry's on the couch, like – do you know what I mean?
Like if I didn't care what people, at all, people thought, I would've been in a way worse place (chuckling). Because, at the same time, like, yes, it's a bad thing to live your life by what other people are doing but I also shouldn't feel guilty for keeping myself in check based on just what everybody in society does.
THERAPIST: M-hmm. [00:37:56]
CLIENT: Like there's a reason everybody gets up and goes to school in the morning; graduates from high school; goes to college; tries to have a successful, meaningful relationship. I mean, I mean there's probably multiple reasons for that, but you know there is a reason why we all live our lives in this way and it is because society keeps us in check. And there is this thing that we all do where we all you know balance our self off what is going on around us. And I know, and I we-, I realize like I had been really feeling guilty about that, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... about really caring what other people thought. And I really just thought like I mean, yeah, I shouldn't only care what other people think. But, at the same time, it's not, I'm not crazy for doing it because I'm not the only one that's doing it. This is just kind of how we operate as people.
THERAPIST: Well it sounds like a standard or maybe the main standard that you assess your actions as whether this will help you not be crazy or facilitate being crazy. [00:39:01]
CLIENT: M-hmm. Yeah, but it didn't used to be that way. Well I guess I just didn't label it as crazy, I just wanted to be normal. I just wanted to make sure that I was normal and like, like everybody else. I guess maybe because I grew up being so not, in a situation so not like everybody else.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But, yeah, so then I do a lot of like well but you're experience is so different you're not like everybody else. This wasn't – I don't know. And then I say, well that's not a reason for you to be (chuckling) like totally kooky and off the wall.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Why do I feel really tense today? I feel like very tense.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: Oh.
THERAPIST: What does it feel like, the tension?
CLIENT: Like I can't sit still.
THERAPIST: Mm, fidgety?
CLIENT: Fidgety. My mouth is very dry.
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:39:59]
CLIENT: And I just feel like I – yeah, I'm very fidgety [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... when I'm anxious. I need to be moving.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, so yeah, we're going home this, obviously for the holidays this weekend and I'm just (sniffing) hoping that everything goes smoothly and well. And I don't think my dad will be around because he was just up for detox but, um, which I think is kind of a good thing. I had a dream last night that he was at my grandmother's and I was there with John, and that he kept saying to me that no one comes to visit him.
THERAPIST: Mm. You were at your grandmother's house?
CLIENT: M-hmm, yeah. Well it was my grandmother's house, it's my uncle's house now but in my dream it was my grandmother's. [00:41:03]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And, um, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Did it look like it did then or it does now?
CLIENT: Like it did then.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, and he just kept saying, you know like I had come by myself to go visit him and, um, when I was there it was just like it always is. I get there and he acts like he doesn't care that I'm there. And then my brother, John, showed up and he only stayed for five minutes. And then, since he was leaving, I was going with him and my dad came out to the car to make sure we knew that our visit wasn't long enough, and that you know no one ever comes to visit him and he is lonely.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So.
THERAPIST: What did you make of that?
CLIENT: That I don't come to visit him and he's lonely (slight chuckle).
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I just don't call him anymore because it's too hard for me. [00:42:02]
THERAPIST: M-hmm, mm.
CLIENT: But I don't think either one of us even gets anything out of me calling him. He doesn't answer and he doesn't call back. And the only thing that's accomplished is that then I'm left with these feelings of, just these bad feelings.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And it's like well who's gaining anything from this?
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So I just stopped, but now that I don't feel good about that either (slight chuckle), so.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I just wish, ooh, I wish [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ... that he would just die already. It's a very terrible thought but it's true.
THERAPIST: Yeah, but even that, I'm not sure how much that would solve for you internally because you're so worried that he's in you. [00:43:04]
CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. But I do accept (ph) to prove all the time that he's, that I'm not like him.
THERAPIST: Yes, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: And [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: ... you do.
CLIENT: ... I don't know why I, that's not enough for me though.
THERAPIST: Because it doesn't ultimately address this sort of very deep, deep-seated fear. It sort of allays your anxiety at moments maybe but that's about it.
CLIENT: M-hmm. But you'd think that these like huge things that I had do-, I have done that are so different from him, it's like well what else am I gonna to need to do? What else is there gonna be that need, that's gonna show me like, see you aren't him. Like there are, what else is there gonna be?
THERAPIST: It's not, I don't think, about proof. I think it's about us really, really getting very deep into these fears and really looking at them very, very deeply.
CLIENT: Yeah, that sounds really scary.
THERAPIST: I know it does. I would imagine it sounds really scary. [00:44:02]
CLIENT: I just, that scares me because, I'm not afraid to talk about it, I'm afraid of what comes after.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I just I don't like leaving and then feeling like I'm going to break.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Like I'm just, want to crawl in my bed and just sleep for a full day afterwards.
THERAPIST: Well that you'd be so, so fragile?
CLIENT: M-hmm. Yeah.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And I'd like [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: And that in itself is a fear.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't like being, feeling that fragile.
THERAPIST: M-hmm. You know maybe we're going to need just to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So next Wednesday I'm not here but I'd be happy to find another time to meet. Would you like to try to do that?
CLIENT: Yeah, that sounds great.
THERAPIST: Okay. Do you know is your schedule a regular work schedule next week? [00:45:01]
CLIENT: No, I'm off all week.
THERAPIST: Oh!
CLIENT: But we're, we're in [inaudible] we're not back until Wednesday afternoon.
THERAPIST: But that's it, so I'll certainly – let me take a look. I should have something later.
CLIENT: M-hmm.
THERAPIST: And [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: No, no, the 27th.
THERAPIST: All right, right, right. Well [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: The 28th.
THERAPIST: Or the week of the 26th?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Let's see. I could do something at – well on Friday afternoon I have a 3:00 timeframe, would that work?
CLIENT: Yeah, that's great.
THERAPIST: Friday
CLIENT: Okay, Friday at 3.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Great.
THERAPIST: Okay, great. There you go.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: Okay. And I could – do you want me to give you a statement for the – well for next week I give you a statement for the month. I don't remember what [inaudible] I can give you if you want.
CLIENT: I think last week. Yeah, for the month would be great. [00:46:02]
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Uh, ah! I can't believe we did an entire month of this! Oh my god. Um, (chuckling and sniffing) the insurance stuff went through, and then as soon as it did Chris was Chris and he said (deepening voice) "well I think you filled something out wrong", and now he's all worried that I've like committed fraud. I don't know, he's so paranoid (chuckling), so.
THERAPIST: Wait (ph), does that mean you have the insurance though?
CLIENT: No, I'm enrolling today because [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: He saved you?
CLIENT: ... he and I got in an argument and he said "do whatever you want to do".
THERAPIST: Okay. Well if you could – I don't remember [inaudible at 0:46:39] if you could pay me for the last statement and then I'll figure out what it was from there, would that be okay?
CLIENT: Yeah, that sounds great.
THERAPIST: Three nights. Yeah, that will be great.
CLIENT: [That'd be great] (ph).
THERAPIST: I think it was just for a couple of sessions and then, yeah, that will be great.
CLIENT: Okay, perfect.
THERAPIST: Okay. We'll figure out the insurance stuff.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
CLIENT: Happy Holidays.
THERAPIST: Thank you, you too. [00:47:06]
