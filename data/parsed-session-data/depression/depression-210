BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So how have you been?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not so great.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, what's happening?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I think I'm getting more and more depressed again.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, shoot.
<b>PT:</b> The thinking process seems to be quite clear
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But for a while there it wasn't and I started taking Ging, Gingko Biloba -
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Because my sister has been taking it and she always tells me, you should try this so I did and I don't know if it's had an influence but I haven't really had that much trouble with the alert and thinking and, you know, staying on track.
<b>DR:</b> So are you still taking it then?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, off and on.  Now what the problem is, the way that we switched the medication - 
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Two of those pills is too much - 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I get a headache, so I've been having 2 on 1 day and then the next day I'll have one with the Gingko and the next day I'll have 2 and the next day I'll have 1 with Gingko so I don't know if that's a good plan or not but that's what I've been doing.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that's with the Effexor you're talking about?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you're taking 2 then 1 then 2 and then 1 - 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But still it kind of builds up till I get a headache again.
<b>DR:</b> All right, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Not a bad one, it's just enough to be annoying.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I was hoping that would just go away but it's not
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you get it every day or on days that you take more?
<b>PT:</b> At first it was, the first day I tried it, it was right away, the first day it was the worst headache and each time it's not as bad but it's and I kept taking it for, you know, days in a row.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And each time it would come back and it would come back so I figured that's probably what was doing it and so then when I would cut back, I'd get over it but it would come back from time to time and probably related to the days when I took 2.
<b>DR:</b> Now let me make sure I understand.  Is that the Effexor XR, the 150's, that you're taking 2 and 1, do you know?  The higher strength, the prescription I gave you the last time, because what happened is the last time we talked about trying the 150's, we were going to go up to 2 and then you called back and said you were going to stay on the other dose, the 3 of the lower strength, do you remember that?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yes, and I didn't because I was quite mixed up and confused on all of that at the time.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And, um,  I came across the prescription for what you had said to boost it
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> So we put that prescription in instead of the one that you ordered for us.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you went to the higher dose and that's the one you've been taking 2 and 1, I understand, okay.  Okay, so you have a headache though, okay.
<b>PT:</b> And the depression is just not budging.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So do you feel sad or irritable or both?
<b>PT:</b> Both.
<b>DR:</b> How are you sleeping?
<b>PT:</b> Not well.
<b>DR:</b> Are you having trouble getting to sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> How long does it take usually after you turn off the lights, the TV?
<b>PT:</b> It varies but, well, I also started a diet and it's very strict.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, what type of diet.
<b>PT:</b> I brought papers about the diet because I'm taking the pills that they suggest go along with it.  It's a program, a metabolic program.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And so it's supposed to be super healthy and all that and they give you vitamins and everything to go with it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And, um, so I don't know if that would have any effect on what I'm doing, I can't feel any effect.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Except that I'm hungry.  The first night I just couldn't go to sleep and the second night I woke up so hungry, I had to get up and eat something and I'm hungry all the time but this is only the first week or so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And they said next week will get worse and then after that it'll get better.
<b>DR:</b> Oh boy, something to look forward to eventually.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And what's the name of this program?
<b>PT:</b> Metabolic Research Center.
<b>DR:</b> And it's something, are you trying to lose weight, is that why you're doing it?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  How much do you weigh now?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I was up to 139
<b>DR:</b> And where do you want to be?
<b>PT:</b> 120 or 115, depending on what I look like when I get to 120.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to get down to looking skinny and drawn and, you know, I don't want to get bones
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I used to but I don't anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So the diet involves using certain vitamins and is it, this schedule of herbs and vitamins that you take, wow, a lot of things to keep track of.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's a lot of pills.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and are you able to eat your normal diet with it or you have- 
<b>PT:</b> No, not yet.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and is it like a
<b>PT:</b> Well for this week we have 3 choices of what we can eat, we pick a protein, a carb, what's the other one, sweet, not sweet, fruit and vegetable.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So it's all basically natural stuff and very little of it.  I mean we can eat as much lettuce as you want but that doesn't fill you up much.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> But I'm not complaining about the diet because I picked it and I want to do it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay
<b>PT:</b> And get through the bad part of it and then I can, then the maintenance program is more like a normal diet, you just have to avoid the bad things and eat the good things.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and how long to you plan to stay on this, do you know yet or you're just going to wait and see.
<b>PT:</b> Approximately 6 weeks or so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> They're saying that if it works according to plan, I should lose 3 pounds a week
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> So I'll be done by the end of November, the beginning of December, somewhere around there.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> That's the other thing I keep in mind, it's only 6 weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, all right, and you started it when, about a week ago?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And have you noticed any weight loss yet?
<b>PT:</b> Two pounds.
<b>DR:</b> So 2 pounds the first week, okay.  So you're having trouble falling asleep and then sometimes you wake up because you're hungry.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah but the sleeping thing, I think it was going on before I started the diet.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I wasn't able to go to sleep.  Now just being hungry makes it worse but
<b>DR:</b> Okay and how's your energy level during the day?
<b>PT:</b> Nothing, I just don't have any and I don't have any drive.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, no motivation, okay.  How about concentration or focus?  If you're on a task or reading or watching TV, can you stay focused?
<b>PT:</b> Pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b> It surprises me because I haven't been on this end of it before, it's always been the other way around.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  What about worrying about things, do you find yourself worrying a lot or not too much?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay or feeling anxious?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I do, yeah, I don't recognize worry in myself - 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But I guess I do because I've got a lot of things to worry about right now
<b>DR:</b> What kind of things are you worrying about?
<b>PT:</b> Well, my parents, I had to move them to assisted living because their basement flooded, it was a sewer backup, so the whole basement has to be reconstructed which I'm kind of heading up -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Plus I'm doing their yard and we're trying to get the house ready for sale and my husband keeps kind of pressuring me subtly that we have to get this on the market because we need the, they need the money and so that's a big pressure, especially because I'm not used to doing any of this, dealing with contractors and insurance companies and all that is just far out of my range.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So this morning, I told [NAME OTHER], I'm done, you have to handle this, I cannot do this.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And we may have to discuss it but I've hit my limits on trying to deal with, I don't understand enough so I can goof it up, you know -
<b>DR:</b> It's hard.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I hear one answer from somebody and then the insurance company says no and then, you know, I talk to somebody, I talk to them, so I just don't know how to handle these things.
<b>DR:</b> I understand, I'm glad you're letting [NAME OTHER], someone else do it, you don't need the added stress.
<b>PT:</b> And then also he keeps telling me that I don't have to do the actual work, I can hire somebody to do the work but I don't know how to do that and I don't know, um, to me it's real important to get the yard done because I started that and they're not getting very far with the house yet but that's all waiting because I had to go by the tile and choose the carpet and all that stuff and we're waiting on those things and the insurance company is backed up for some reason, so I keep going over there and working on the yard and then he gets annoyed with me because I'm not keeping up with the housework at home.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm kind of running in circles here and not, this morning I just sat still and thought about it and decided that if I'm a Christian I'm under God, if I'm a wife, I'm under my husband so what he thinks is important, it comes before what I think is important and I should go with that first and then do the next things, so since this morning I'm deciding to try to keep up with the house stuff first and then go over and work on mom and dad's place.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But, um, it's frustrating to me because it seems to, it feels very unfair and it feels very controlled and dominated by him.  Why does it care if anything is dusted or not.  He's never there hardly.  He comes home and eats a bowl of cereal and goes to sleep and leaves in the morning, you know, so why is it important to keep the house up to date, I mean everything right
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> When I have all this other pressure to deal with at the other house but if he thinks that's the way it should be then I'll do it his way and he can take care of the pressure over there.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you doing anything for fun these days?
<b>PT:</b> No
<b>DR:</b> Painting?
<b>PT:</b> Well, actually, I like doing this hard outdoor work.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> But he's always giving me negative feedback on it so it wrecks the fun.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you doing any painting?
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't have time for anything like that.
<b>DR:</b> Do you get any enjoyment out of just day to day activities or do you feel like you're just going through the motions?
<b>PT:</b> These days it's just going through, just getting done.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Even the yard stuff is not fun anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Are you having - 
<b>PT:</b> I'm thinking - 
<b>DR:</b> I'm sorry, go ahead.
<b>PT:</b> I'm just thinking maybe I'm too old, maybe I should just stop doing this stuff but then I think maybe it's just because I'm getting, I'm depressed again.
<b>DR:</b> Well it could be depression and just being overwhelmed too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Has it gotten to the point [PATIENT NAME] that you've had any suicidal thoughts?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I've, you know, everybody thinks of it, boy if I just wasn't here, he could probably handle this better but not seriously.
<b>DR:</b> No thoughts of taking your life actively, okay.  And the Zoloft, I have you on 150 to 200 which is one and a half or 2 pills a day, how many have you been taking?
<b>PT:</b> One and a half.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Any side effects from it that you're aware of?
<b>PT:</b> No, I wouldn't no which, the side effects, what they're from.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, which pill.
<b>DR:</b> The Zoloft, the possible side effects can be nausea, diarrhea, excessive sweating - 
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I've had that, always.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Hot flashes -
<b>PT:</b> I didn't know that contributed.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's weird, it can contribute or it can treat them.  Some women take Zoloft because in some women it stops their hot flashes so - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It can go either direction.
<b>PT:</b> Well, because of my cancer, I'm on anticancer; I mean antihormone pills to prevent it coming back.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And I don't know how that affects me.  It's supposed to cause those problems also - 
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So how would I know which one is the culprit and it's just all the time, it's not like a flash where I used to have, just all of the sudden you're dying of heat, I'm just always too warm.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah, the only way to know would be to stop the Zoloft and see if the sweating went away but that also involves the risk that the depression could get worse if we did that so.
<b>PT:</b> Well I don't know also how long I've been on Zoloft but I've been on that other pill for over 3 years.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, let me look back and see here.
<b>PT:</b> And that one, so I've had this symptom for over 3 years.
<b>DR:</b> And Effexor can do it too so, yeah, we started the Zoloft in April of '05 so it's been two and a half years about.  Yeah, the Effexor was longer than that.  Okay, anything else going on that I haven't asked you about before we talk about.
<b>PT:</b> My daughter is getting worse.
<b>DR:</b> Oh she is, in what way?
<b>PT:</b> She's been ill for 2 years
<b>DR:</b> With what again?
<b>PT:</b> It's a chronic, like an infection in her whole body
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> And they can't get rid of it.  It's like Lyme disease only it's not, it doesn't respond to the Lyme disease medications and they don't know what to do for Lyme disease either but this one, she's on a program of antibiotics and so far nothing is working and she's to the point now where she's getting these back spasms so she can't walk and her kidneys hurt, all her insides hurt, she has terrible headaches.  She said the last headache lasted 9 days and she's still trying to go to college, I mean she's still taking 3 classes so she's just miserable and now her dog has got cancer.
<b>DR:</b> Oh my goodness .
<b>PT:</b> And that's her only family.  She's had him in surgery twice already and now she found another lump. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh boy.
<b>PT:</b> So she's just at the verge of tears all the time because everything hurts and everything is stress and now her dog is her only family and he's about to go.  I mean she doesn't know that, she's just worried that it might be.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So it's terrible for her and [NAME OTHER]'s brother is getting toward the end.  Right now he's going back to India for a couple of months but when he comes back he's got 4 more months of chemo and that's the end of anything they know to do for him and he's losing weight by the day.  He's taller than [NAME OTHER] and he weighs less.
<b>DR:</b> What kind of cancer does he have?
<b>PT:</b> I don't really know.  It's so complicated.  He's got several kinds.  It's somewhere near his bowels or his stomach, I don't know exactly.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so boy, there's plenty of stress in your life isn't there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and mom and dad are in the nursing home, I mean assisted living, and they've got a great place.  My brother came to help me find a place for them.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> And we did find a great place and they're happy there in general but mom is not mentally capable of just settling down and being relaxed.  Every so often, she starts crying I want to go home and she doesn't understand that she has to stay there and dad is just wrung out because he still has to take care of her even though they're in this assisted living place.  The girl comes and gives mom a bath once a day and then after that she'll have another accident so dad has got to take care of her and it's just, I know he's not real happy and there's nothing to about it at this point, you know, just sort of sit there and wait.
<b>DR:</b> Oh boy.
<b>PT:</b> So I've been doing everything I can.  I got him new glasses and keeping him informed of what's going on at his house and all that and the relatives keep calling, what am I doing with all the stuff at mom and dad's house.  Finally I told them to just back off and leave me alone, I'll let you know when I need your help, you know, because at this point I just can't go any faster and I don't want to go any faster because I know I'll be so stressed out I won't make good decisions or be able to handle it.  So, um, I haven't really started on the big push of picking out what to do with everything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I picked out everything I could think of that they would want to have with them and now then we go through the next phase of figuring out what else they might want that I didn't think of but we can't take mom home and don't want to take dad home either, so it means that I have to probably make lists of everything that's at the house and go over it with them.
<b>DR:</b> Oh boy.
<b>PT:</b> So it's just so much.
<b>DR:</b> It is a lot, yeah.  Well, [PATIENT NAME], I'm thinking what do we do to get you feeling better because it's at least easier to deal with if you're not so depressed.  It sounds like the Effexor is not working and in fact is giving you headaches, so we probably just want to back off on it and we could get you completely off of it and try something else.  Do you want to try switching?
<b>PT:</b> I think if you have any other ideas, let's try something else.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, there are a lot of other ones out there.  Let me just look back and see, before we tried Lexapro and Prozac - 
<b>PT:</b> I didn't actually think of it but I have been feeling sometimes kind of nauseated
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But I didn't connect it with that but it could be from the upper dose, the bigger dose of
<b>DR:</b> Effexor?
<b>PT:</b> What we were taking, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It could be, it could be. Um - 
<b>PT:</b> It hasn't been bad, it's just been, you know, like yuck, I just don't feel very good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and I'm thinking we want to find something that isn't going to cause weight gain also.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Because you're trying to lose weight.  The ones that are best at not causing weight gain typically are Zoloft which you're on and another one called Wellbutrin
<b>PT:</b> Wellbutrin I've tried.
<b>DR:</b> Tried it and it didn't work?
<b>PT:</b> I think I tried it, yeah, it may be it was them that I'm thinking of.
<b>DR:</b> Let me look back in my notes and see if you tried it before you came to see me.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, I was on - 
<b>DR:</b> I have a note in here that you tried it without benefits - 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Way back somewhere.
<b>PT:</b> I think it was in addition to Prozac way back.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And did the Prozac work for a while?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, for years.
<b>DR:</b> Because with Prozac there's something called the poop out phenomenon, have I ever talked to you about that?  I don't know who came up with that term.  That's actually the term they use at medical conferences.
<b>PT:</b> I think you did tell me one time.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, where it works well for a long time and then it stops working, we don't know why.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes if you get off of it and go back on it then it works fine again, not forever maybe but for years again, so one of the things we could consider, since it worked so well before, is going back to the Prozac.  If we did that, we'd probably get you off the Zoloft and the Effexor though because you don't want to take Prozac with Zoloft usually.  That's one option, we can go back to Prozac.  We can try Wellbutrin now in combination with Zoloft which is a reasonable thing to try.  They are both energizing antidepressants so you'd probably have more energy but we'd have to be careful that it doesn't prevent you from sleeping because you're already having trouble sleeping.  Another, well, there's another option that's really good for depression which is a combination of Effexor and Remeron but Remeron can cause weight gain.  We could also do something to try to boost the effectiveness of the Zoloft, there are several different strategies, I'm just kind of thinking out loud with you, they range from using a mild stimulant like Adderall or Ritalin to a little bit of thyroid hormone.  Those options are very safe and not very likely to cause side effects and they work a fair amount of the time.  Do you have any history of thyroid problems?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> One of the things we could think about is adding a little bit of thyroid hormone which is a very safe thing to do and it works about 50% of the time and people feel better and they don't get any side effects from it.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> So I guess it depends on if we want to make major overhauls like switch back to Prozac which you were on before or want to do something that's a little less dramatic I guess and try and get the medicines that you're on to work more effectively.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> But I think we need to back off the Effexor because it's just giving you headaches and not helping.  Do you feel strongly about wanting to go back to something you've done before like Prozac or try something different?
<b>PT:</b> I don't have any.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  What I would suggest, why don't we try the thyroid first along with Zoloft, that combination because it's a very safe combination.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Minimal risk of any problems with side effects and it works at least half the time.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Which is pretty close to starting all over with a new medicine again.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Does that sound all right, okay.
<b>PT:</b> My parents both of thyroid problems and my sister has thyroid problems.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I don't know if that's a factor but - 
<b>DR:</b> It could be - 
<b>PT:</b> It's in the family but I haven't been affected that I know of.
<b>DR:</b> And have you had your thyroid checked in the last year or 2?
<b>PT:</b> It usually comes in any kind of blood series doesn't it?
<b>DR:</b> If you go in for like an annual physical, they'll usually check it.
<b>PT:</b> Well I haven't had that but I've had other, I've had a series of blood tests because of the cancer check ups, I keep having these check ups every 6 months or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so I don't know if they test it or not.  They don't necessarily routinely check it.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> But ultimately it doesn't matter, if your thyroid test comes back normal, sometimes people still do better if they get put on thyroid hormones.
<b>PT:</b> It's always been normal every other time I've ever had it checked so - 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It may or may not have been checked lately - 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But it's always been normal.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so let me write out prescriptions of what we'll do here.  So the Zoloft we'll keep at the same dose.
<b>PT:</b> That's the one I take 1 a day of?
<b>DR:</b> Right, one and a half tablets daily.  Effexor XR 150mg.  I'll write you a prescription for your thyroid.  Let me get some samples of the Effexor for you so you can taper off of it without having to get a new prescription, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Oh that's great.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Let me explain this to you so it makes some sense hopefully.  So, um, with the Zoloft you want to continue taking the one and a half tablets daily just like you've been doing.  The Effexor, the pills you have are 150mg, what you want to do is just take 1 each day for 7 days.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then you want to back down to 75mg, which are in here, each day for 7 days and then the smaller ones, the 37.5, each day for 7days and then stop it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then go ahead, you can go ahead and start now the Cytomel, which is right here, it's the thyroid, 50mcg each morning - 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I'll be taking the Cytomel and this and going through the program with taking this at the same time?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you'll be on this at the same time and you'll be slowly tapering off the Effexor over several weeks.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> The reason we do that is to avoid any kind of withdrawals from stopping because sometimes when people stop Effexor, they notice a little bit of dizziness, maybe a little bit of being a little more emotional or something.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So does that sound okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well let's try this, uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And then are we going to add something else to the Zoloft for depression or are you
<b>DR:</b> That's what the thyroid is for, yeah, that's the purpose of the thyroid is to try to boost the Zoloft to make it more effective.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, all right.
<b>DR:</b> For the depression.  Now the other thing we need to think about is do we need to add in something for sleep or not, do you feel like you need something to help you sleep or do you want to wait and see how things go with these other changes?
<b>PT:</b> Well, what would you suggest?
<b>DR:</b> Well if we did there are several options, you could start with something real mild like an over the counter sleeping medicine which are usually antihistamines or you can just take Benadryl, then the next step up would be something that's a little bit more sedating like, um, Trazodone is one that we often use, it's a non addictive sleeping medicine.
<b>PT:</b> Well on the other end of it, it's hard to wake up in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, then we'd want something short acting.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't want to make it worse in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> And there are some milder sleeping medicines like Lunesta.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That is gentler, that people sometimes use just to help them get a good night sleep without feeling groggy in the morning. Do you want to - 
<b>PT:</b> Something like that might be helpful.  I won't take it unless I just can't go to sleep, then I'll take it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay that's fine.  Let me get you some samples and a prescription so if it works you can get it filled.  
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I thought Lunesta was over the counter.
<b>DR:</b> No, Lunesta is one that you need a prescription for.
<b>PT:</b> I love their ads.
<b>DR:</b> Oh the little butterfly commercials - 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's funny how you see a butterfly near people in pictures anywhere now, it looks like the Lunesta ad.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I forgot to mention my sister.  I'm worried about her too.
<b>DR:</b> You've got a lot going on right now it sounds like.  I'll give you some samples.  Here's the Lunesta prescription.  
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if it's normal for everybody or if it's just, if the medicine makes a difference but I find that I just shut off things I don't want to think about like my brother - 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And my sister and their problems.  My brother's barn blew away in a tornado and he's not having any luck getting it fixed and they're just about to, he can't hold a job, they don't have any money, she's selling stuff on the internet just to keep them in food.
<b>DR:</b> Oh boy.
<b>PT:</b> I just, you know, everywhere I look there's another big issue.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> My sister has got to be over 300 pounds by now, I don't know, she's just huge and she doesn't do anything to help it.  She did quit smoking quite a while ago but I was thrilled about that -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I'm hoping she's going to start dieting but I just don't know, I don't have any faith that she'll be able to do it.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Well, I think it's probably good, when there's so much going on, to be able to shut some of it off because otherwise it can just feel overwhelming to try to think about all the things that are going on.  So [PATIENT NAME], do you want to check back in a month or so to see if all this is working?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess so.
<b>DR:</b> That would probably be a good idea this time, not going quite so long.  If you have any questions or problems sooner, you can call me, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> So that'll put us into early November and remind me, are afternoons best for you?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I'll throw out some possibilities I have, on Monday November 5th at 2:30 is one option.
<b>PT:</b> Other days besides Monday makes it easier.
<b>DR:</b> Wednesday I have - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The 7th at 2:30?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Next time I'm going to leave a little earlier.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I planned on it this time but I got here right on the dot.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> I was planning to get here earlier.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] at 2:30, okay, here you go and again if you have any questions before then, please call, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And hopefully we'll get you feeling better here.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've got so many things coming up.  On the positive side, my husband was elected to the board of, chairman of the board for the real estate association.
<b>DR:</b> Oh great.
<b>PT:</b> And that's going to involve a lot of traveling for both of us, conventions, stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> Huh, I hope it'll be
<b>PT:</b> In some ways it's fun, in some ways I don't like it but I'm trying to make the best of it 
<b>DR:</b> Oh good, I hope it's enjoyable for you, to have some things positive happening instead of things that are stressful.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> All right, take care.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> You're very welcome, see you later.
<b>PT:</b> Bye bye.
<b>DR:</b> Bye bye.
