BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: Morning. I want to kill the dog. I'm just tired of cleaning up shit and piss and...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know his walks are frustrating and it's just I can't, I mean you know, the vet had me put him on this diet and he stopped eating the rice and it didn't seem to be working that much. So I started feeding regular food again and he seemed to be doing better. He looked like he was losing all this weight and he seems to be putting weight back on. [00:00:49]
But it's just like every fucking morning I wake up and there's just shit and piss, and it's like multiple, it's not like he just goes in there and poops and pees and that's it. It's like he's going in there multiple times during the night 'cuz it's multiple piles and piss all over the place. And um, I can't afford to keep paying this fucking vet to figure out what's wrong with the dog.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, it's like I won't, you know I literally had to throw him in the cage this morning 'cuz he wouldn't come. I had to drag him and I let him go and he goes the wrong way.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:01:28]
CLIENT: And I grab him and he's lost a lot of weight so I can throw him around pretty easily, I just picked him up and literally threw him through the door.
And I know it's part of all my other frustrations building up and I'm taking it out on him, but it's just too much for me. It's too much. I mean what am I gonna do when Ian starts with his feet. He's going to the bathroom where Ian's bed folds down. I've lifted it up. And um what's he gonna do when Ian starts sleeping in there, is he gonna pee on the bed? You know? I don't know what he's gonna do. I don't know how to make him stop. I don't know if I gotta keep him in the cage all night long. [00:02:26]
He's just gonna turn into a caged animal 'cuz I'm just sick of it. You know? Still I have to clean up piss you know? I put newspaper down in the crate and he pees in it every time. It's like why is this fucking dog peeing every two seconds?
Pause at [00:02:42] to [00:03:18]
CLIENT: It's like everyday it starts off like this and I'm just so fucking pissed and frustrated and just (pause) it's just so difficult for me to focus on what I need to do and what I have to get done. And I'm in this situation now where I'm like driving all over the fucking earth all day long.
People are like I keep stopping by your new office and you're never there. I'm like yeah 'cuz I'm fucking driving to this meeting, to this closing, I fucked up this, I gotta go fix that. [00:03:52]
I told you on Friday how I thought I fucked up that closing and sure enough I fucked it up. So I had to drive up there, drop the documents off, go pick them up. They hadn't signed, they didn't initial them, they didn't take the two minutes to initial them. So I had to go inside and wait for them to initial them.
I still don't know if that thing is gonna be funded today or not. If it is it's the end of the day. You know I'm supposed to be the first person that's president of E&G;, I'm supposed to meet the first one on one with new members this morning. Which is a complete waste of time.
Fucking Center calls me you know, well the property manager keeps trying to stop by and you're not there. I owe them like a hundred and some dollars, I'm like I'm glad you called, my air conditioning is not working you know?
I think I got some bill from them, I thought it was, I didn't even open it. I've got tons of mail I haven't opened. I'm not taking care of my uh, reconcile my accounts. Life is just constant bullshit. I drank till I blacked out on Saturday night at my School reunion. I don't think I'll be getting any business from those folks. I puked all over them.
THERAPIST: My goodness.
CLIENT: Picked up my suit that afternoon, back to the dry cleaner. [00:05:43]
I've just got like no clean clothes. I just got a ton of laundry, and I'm like do I go to a laundry mat? I can't do it downstairs, I can't go to at Jess's, I can't do it one, one thing at a time, it's too much. Every dress shirt I have has fucking sweat all around the collar you know? I just, I can't keep up with it all. You know, I'm just barely you know, it's like, cleaning out all the dishes, well half the dishes in the sink, there's still a sink full of dishes you know.
There's fucking down everywhere, it's just, there's crap everywhere. I just can't, can't keep up with it. (pause) [00:06:32]
Played ultimate Handball last night and um, I took off my guy was kind of playing me, and so I took off on a long run. Which I do all the fucking time. You know? Most of the times they don't throw to me, it's not always easy to get that throw off.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So this guy gets the throw off and I make this long huge catch and the captain of the other team is also the captain of my club team. I hear him saying to the guy that beat me; I can't believe you were beat by Cam and I'm like.... People were giving me shit all night at the bar, where'd this speed come from and it's like... [00:07:22]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I am embarrassed because I played well. It's like they've never seen me play well you know, I make a good throw and people act like they've never seen me make a good throw before but I do it all the time.
Pause at [00:07:49] to [00:08:45]
CLIENT: I gotta buy a desk; I don't know what desk to buy you know? I spend more than a hundred and fifty bucks, I'm supposed to buy it by looking at pictures at desks on my e-mail you know? It's like I don't fucking know.
I don't have a tape measure to see if they're going to fit in the office, I imagine they're gonna fit in the office. How long is your desk, five feet?
THERAPIST: I think so, yep.
CLIENT: I got a new client coming in Thursday, I mean I can't, I'm embarrassed to have people in the office 'cuz it's like a total fucking wreck. It's like I gotta get to this desk so it's like I have a place to put stuff you know? [00:09:46]
Through the window, you just look in there and you see crap all over the place; chair but no desk.
THERAPIST: Mmhm.
Pause at [00:10:02] to [00:12:58]
CLIENT: I'll be gone all day long, it's just, I come home, the dog's gonna have fucking pissed, when I play Handball I barely have time to give him a walk. I don't know if he's not getting enough walks or... Every fucking night you know? It's like one night he didn't. He doesn't do it, so I think oh he's better you know?
THERAPIST: Mmhm. [00:13:30]
CLIENT: I don't know if it's because the medication, the doctor says it's not, but you know, it's the only change, since he fucking started taking this fucking medication.
THERAPIST: Hmm. Then that could be it.
CLIENT: So the thirty year old chick on my Handball team lives like two blocks away from me.
THERAPIST: Get out.
CLIENT: I was complaining to one of the women on our team, um, I don't know, you know, I've just been bitching about Jess and I just you know, just from like it's over it's done, I just can't take her anymore. And um, you know she's joking I should go on like Match.com or something like that.
Then she goes, too bad there's no one on the team, oh but there's Barbara, she's cute, but uh, she's thirty. I'm like, thanks. [00:14:59]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: I just don't seem to ever have anything going my way you know?<br />
THERAPIST: Yeah you have really not had much go your way for a few years.
CLIENT: I mean, you know, business has picked up but still it's like it's not picked up to the point of any sort of steadiness you know, it just, once the summer is over then all the purchases are gonna go away and you know I'm gonna be fucking right back where I was come fall.
Broke, and (sigh) the bank turned down our modification. [00:15:58]
THERAPIST: Oh, sorry to hear that.
CLIENT: I just don't fucking care anymore, you know, if Jess wants to keep the fucking house she's got to figure out how to keep the fucking house. I've exerted so much fucking effort to you know, keep a house I'm never gonna fucking live in. I'm just, I'm done. You know? Talk to your fucking parents, borrow money from your brother, do something. You know, get on a repayment plan with them. [00:16:27]
I'm, I'm not involved you know? She keeps wanting, the whole time, she just can't get it through her fucking thick head now, how the bank is not gonna just put everything in her name. And look at it like, can she afford the house? Still though I've told her twenty times that that's not gonna happen, she still brings that up.
It's like you know, where am I gonna live? I don't give a shit where you fucking live. Oh, so the kids have to fucking move. She's got like you know, eight grand that she's got sitting in a fucking bank check that she can move anywhere she wants to move. (pause)
She has a post on Facebook. "I give up", was her post. (pause) And I'm on there you know, just busting my ass trying to get business. You know, she has all this business and people who owe her money because she can't get a fucking retainer or collect money. And I'm the one who has to send out the billing. [00:18:01]
It's just the same shit every day. None of this is gonna sound new to you. I'm just looking at my shoelace and want to puke on it.
Pause at [00:18:25] to [00:19:07]
CLIENT: (sigh) I just...
Pause at [00:19:08] to [00:20:08]
CLIENT: That's it, it's all I got to say. I don't know what to do, I just...
Pause at [00:20:19] to [00:22:55]
THERAPIST: Do you feel this hopeless most of the time?
CLIENT: A lot of the time.
Pause at [00:23:04] to [00:23:27]
CLIENT: I mean I felt like doing something at work and I'm distracted by it you know, playing Handball I'm distracted by it but...
Pause at [00:23:35] to [00:24:25]
CLIENT: I feel like I'm putting forth you know, so much effort to... (pause) try and make business work, to keep the fucking dog piss and shit up off the floor, just it's wearing me down; just fucking wearing me down. You know, meeting with the new financial advisor tomorrow you know, it's like just, unrelenting.
It's like I'm, I'm not getting paid to do all this shit you know? I'm not getting paid.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:25:06]
CLIENT: Who knows if this guy will ever send me a piece of business, I have no fucking idea.
Pause at [00:25:21] to [00:25:56]
CLIENT: I got to wait around tomorrow afternoon so Comcast can come and install my phone line, which they're gonna charge me two hundred and something dollars for to install. Fifty bucks a month just so I can have a fax line. It's fucking ridiculous, you know? It's fucking 2012 and a phone line costs fifty bucks, it's ridiculous.
I can't, I can't change you know to scanning or faxing over the Internet. I just, I get too much stuff, that I ...
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:26:32]
CLIENT: I have a closing package and I fax these ten documents you know and it's like. (pause) I have got this hearing at the end of the month and my clients want to write a fucking victim letter. It's like, it's just a summary judgment motion, the judge doesn't care how victimized you feel you know? Everyone feels victimized; it's the least of his concerns.
I keep meaning to scan the other sides' motion and send it to them but I just can't fucking remember to do it. I don't even know where the fucking motion is, I have got shit all over the place. (pause)
I'm going to have to go with the metallic desk because it has drawers. You know, the wooden one doesn't have drawers. [00:27:47]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So I will have some old school crappy metallic desk you know? I could put blinds up, but there's more money I don't have.
Pause at [00:28:08] to [00:28:43]
CLIENT: I made my own coffee this morning. I saved two dollars and forty cents. Less whatever it cost for me to make that coffee.
THERAPIST: Um, how come you're keeping the dog?
CLIENT: What else can I do? I don't know what else to do.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: You know, he's nine and a half years old you know, there's nowhere for him to go.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And he's gotten aggressive around other dogs. You know, he's, he gets separation anxiety and he's got all kinds of problems. I mean he's only got one stop you know? That's putting him to sleep. Nobody is gonna take that dog. [00:29:47]
THERAPIST: Uh huh. How long do pitbulls tend to live?
CLIENT: Our last one lived twelve years.
THERAPIST: The animal shelters won't take him because he's too old?
CLIENT: I imagine, I don't know. I just, part of me can't do it you know?
THERAPIST: Can't do it because they might put him to sleep or can't do it because you'd be parting with him?
CLIENT: A little of both. (sigh)
Pause at [00:30:31] to [00:30:55]
THERAPIST: 'cuz you love him.
CLIENT: I'm lonely enough as it is. I mean I'm lonely enough as it is you know?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
Pause at [00:31:15] to [00:32:41]
CLIENT: I don't even know when I'm gonna do my fucking laundry. Where I'm gonna do my fucking laundry. I haven't gone to the fucking laundromat in forever.
Pause at [00:32:55] to [00:33:56]
CLIENT: I should have fucking done it on Sunday.
Pause at [00:33:57] to [00:35:31]
THERAPIST: How much do you feel like the dog, like your, made a mess every day, like you're anxious as all hell, like you're trapped and terrified of the ways you've been left alone?
CLIENT: That's new to me; I haven't put that all together.
THERAPIST: Think.
Pause at [00:36:08] to [00:36:38]
CLIENT: Aaah. It wants to drink at every fucking puddle on the street. I'm worried he's gonna get some sickness you know. He goes to every fucking puddle. I don't know what's wrong with this fucking dog. It's just, he probably has dry mouth from the fucking medication and I don't know if that's making him drink so much, if that's why he's peeing so much. I don't know.
I don't have the energy to fucking deal with it.
It's like Jess has the burden of taking care of the kids, but she also gets the benefit of having the kids.
THERAPIST: Mmhm. [00:37:44]
CLIENT: You know? I get none of that. I can't even have a sleepover anymore. I see them on Thursday mornings. Friday afternoon for fucking soccer. I have a Handball tournament on Saturday so I'm not going to soccer.
She's probably already planned something for fucking Sunday that doesn't include me.
THERAPIST: Can you tell her you want to see them on Sunday?
CLIENT: I guess I could. [00:38:39]
THERAPIST: Do you want to see them on Sunday?
CLIENT: I want to see them, but, I don't know. It just feels like every day, something is fucking going on, and Sunday is the one day I can just sit and fucking do nothing. Not worry about anything. Not running out to get anything done. That's not gonna happen.
THERAPIST: Mmhm.
CLIENT: You know, it's like a fucking race tonight, if Handball gets canceled I can probably go and try to do my laundry. But, I don't want Handball to get canceled, I want to fucking play. I need to play. I'm out of shape. It's not gonna do me any good playing you know, once every so often. We have a scrimmage on Thursday. I'll play probably four or five games on Saturday.
I just don't feel Sunday.
Pause at [00:40:11] to [00:40:37]
CLIENT: I mean getting stuck taking the kids to the museum is fine, something like that. Try to find birds or something.
Pause at [00:40:47] to [00:42:47]
CLIENT: My shoulders are sore.
THERAPIST: At least you're getting out you know?
CLIENT: I do my best. Doing something good, doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I can't even do that without you know?
Pause at [00:43:29] to [00:44:01]
THERAPIST: Well we should finish up for now.
CLIENT: Yeah. (sigh)
THERAPIST: I um, I'm gonna need to reschedule I think for next Friday the twenty fifth.
