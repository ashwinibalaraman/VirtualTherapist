______________________________________________________________________________
PATIENT:  (9-minute silence) I think today I'm having trouble just deciding how to begin.  And it made me, after — I've had a lot of, well, I came in with a lot of thoughts and they just all are, they just seemed jumbled up.  And it's, trying to sort them out is something I've been trying to do, well, I tried to do last night.  But then it, I just realized I was finding it very hard to even make the decision to start and just start on anything.  Which is also the trouble I had last night.  I just, when I got home I felt so depressed and sorry for myself and everything.  And I just, I didn't feel as if I could make myself do anything or make any decisions, even to just go out and buy food.  (Pause) And I think last night when I was just wondering why I was feeling so upset, it all just seemed to come down to the fact that I was worried about those reports and how they'd be received and then disturbed about what I was doing with the program at school.  But that really was secondary to worrying about the reports.  And also, in thinking about the program at school, it, I don't know exactly what is bothering me but part of it seems to be I somehow feel I can't admit I don't know what to do.  But I don't know what to do.  And so I'm just feeling confused.  (Analyst coughs)  (Pause)
And all last night I felt I had to keep analyzing everything and trying to figure out what was the matter with me and what I was thinking and what I should do.  And that just seems to be another rut I get into.  And MSCZ will often say, "Well, you just have to stop thinking about it."  And I know it's true so I'll just sit there and, I don't know, (analyst coughs) not only feel sorry for myself but I just go around in a circle and I don't get anywhere with thinking about it.  But I never seem to, I don't know, it's too tempting to just sit there and think about it.  I can't think what else I could do.  (Pause) Or when I'm feeling that depressed I, I was talking about this with MSCZ and there was a time when he was so depressed that he didn't even get out of bed for a few days and he didn't eat anything.  And I was not feeling that depressed but I was feeling pretty close to it.  And so we were just talking about how he got himself out of it and how, once he was able to do things he just decided what would make him feel good and he'd do those things.  And when I started thinking about that I just, I don't know what would make me feel good. (Pause)
Seems like the only things that make me feel good are when I escape by reading or going to the movies or know I have everybody's approval and also have full control.  I was kind of, well, I was half aware of what I was doing and half not last night.  Because when we went to bed MSCZ wanted to have intercourse.  And he was just sort of acting like no matter what I said he was just going to go ahead and insist on having it.  And I was feeling sorry for myself enough so this was not something I wanted at all.  And I kept protesting and m—, thinking of all sorts of reasons why not and sometimes really feeling upset at the thought of it but yet, when he finally said, "Okay, forget it."  Then immediately I wanted him to have intercourse with me, even though I wasn't really very involved in it.  I still wanted him to have it.  And it was, just seemed like I wanted to control it entirely and say no and then say yes.  (3-minute silence)
Thinking about having to just have the control made me think tod—, about today.  And I was experimenting with something in letting the children dramatize and be fairly free in it.  And I was really nervous while I was doing it because, on the one hand, I can see I don't know how to direct them yet without making, without being over directed, or making them be over directed.  And in letting them be free I just think I'm really afraid I'm going to lose any kind of control over them, that the only kind I have now is having them be afraid of losing my approval.  And I don't know what kind of control can be put in that place if I continue to do what I really think would be a better thing to do in the class.  Because then I will make them feel less dependent on my control or my approval.  And, I don't know, I just am, I don't know how to handle it. (Pause)
And this was a distinction that was bothering me when I was thinking about the reports too, in being so concerned about them, I think I've gone from one extreme to the other.  And first I'll think that I have to do everything to please my supervisor and so I'm not doing anything to please myself.  And then I'll think, well, if I have any strength then I should be pleasing myself.  And then I'm left without knowing how much you can please yourself and do what you think is right and how much you still adjust to pleasing somebody who's in charge of you.  Which I suppose is that same old dilemma of either following completely or having to lead completely.  And although I knew I was way over concerned, I just wondered, well, how much concern would be normal for a person to feel.  And I don't know, it just seems I'm worrying an awful lot about what's normal.  (Silence)
And I think another thing has bothered me the last few days in what's happening to my thinking.  When I'm worrying about how over disciplined the children are, over structured and when I try to give them an opportunity to be a little bit freer in what they choose to do and how they choose to express themselves, then I just, I can't think about the program I'm supposed to be following.  And I can't put myself into it at all.  So that the few times I do the things that are connected with the prescribed program they don't work out because I, I'm half-heartedly doing it.  And this is what I don't know to put in the place or how to effectively do the same thing according to my newer approach.  And I just will go around and around in circles on this.  (Silence) I think I'm having this same problem today.  And I'll say things and then it doesn't seem there's really anything more to say but my mind will keep going back to them.  (Pause) Well, it's probably what people used to say to me, "Don't dwell on things."  And it's what I do do.
ANALYST: Who said that?
PATIENT:  I don't know.  I'd guess my mother but it might not have been.  I know both she and my sister have, my older sister, have said, "Don't worry so much."  Or, "Don't worry about things."  Or, "Don't be such a worrier."  That kind of comment, that refers to the same thing that I do.  (Pause) But it just sometimes seems I can't take my mind off it.  And when I know that it's just a pointless thing to be doing, I'll try to and I don't know, just the trying of it sometimes makes me just feel so exhausted that I can't do anything else.  And then I'll go through another cycle of thoughts of wondering if I'm really trying and if I'm just feeling sorry for myself and enjoying it and all that sort of thought, at the end of which I'll kind of say, well, I have to pull myself together.  And it's, I get very grim with myself and make myself go out.  If I had to go shopping I'll make myself go do the shopping.  And I always feel when I'm getting out like that, that I'm sort of in sleepwalking or something.  It's almost, I can hardly bear to think of another kind of problem, like what to buy. (Pause)
And I think last night — I don't feel it the same way.  Often I'll feel much more intensely at night than I do in the morning, something, which I suppose is natural.  But last night I was feeling very intensely that all these things were just problems I was creating and I didn't know how to stop creating them.  And that was very disturbing.  (Pause) Well, I think of MSCZ will often say when I'm going on and on and on worrying about something, "You just have to stop thinking about it."  That's what he would say instead of, "Don't dwell on it."  And I just, I agree but then these thoughts will just keep coming back into my mind.
ANALYST: Let me paraphrase a little what the, the essential part of the things you're concerned about seems to be from what you say.  One seems to be something that you have called competition in the past, and anyway some kind of difference of approach between you and your supervisor, this woman.  And it's around the issue of how to take care of the boys, the little boys.  And you're not sure whether you have a right to your opinions and it seems to take the form of, eh, you don't know what your opinions are.  Because vis-�-vis her you're not certain.  When I put it this way I wonder what it brings to your mind.
PATIENT:  Well, my first thoughts were that it's not that she and I are in disagreement as what I've been taught to do at the school.  And when I came I didn't know anything and also my frame of mind being of the type to believe anything that my supervisors would tell me, uhm, I learned a certain approach, approach in what to do.  And it's just now gradually I'm beginning to see I don't agree with all this.  And I think the supervisor I have now and I, if I can be honest about what I do think is right, would agree.  It's just that I don't know, I'm beginning to know generally what I think is right, I don't know specifically what to do.  And somehow I just don't feel I can tell her this.
ANALYST: What image comes to your mind when you imagine telling her?
PATIENT:  Well, just that she'll think I'm not a very good teacher because if I tell her, then it ha—, means I have to admit that I don't have very much experience and what I have is extremely limited.  And I, I don't know, I get the feeling that she'll think I shouldn't even be up there doing anything and that then I won't have any right to my opinions.  On the other hand, I don't know quite why I feel this way because she must know what my background is.  So it isn't a secret to her that this is the only experience I've had, with this school.  And she knows the previous supervisor, knows the approach that person had and so she probably knows very well what my background is.  And I wouldn't be telling her a thing if I went up and her how I feel like this.
I think the other thing, and I don't know whether this is rationalizing it or what, but every once in a while I'll think to myself, well, I should do it because I'd feel better and I'd feel more honest.  But then I worry that it would just be another form of going out and being told what to do and what the expectations are and sort of saying, well, all I'm doing is obeying orders and not thinking what I believe.  And I get confused about which way to behave or whether I might do the wrong thing for the right reason or the right thing for the wrong reason.  I don't know, it just, I can just see I'm creating this huge problem out of probably nothing.
ANALYST: It seems unlikely you're creating it out of nothing.  It seems more likely you're creating it out of your experience with women who have some control and say about your life.
PATIENT:  (Pause) But that thought in itself confuses me because the women I can think of who could have made me feel this way were all people I came across after I'd already developed this reaction.  And so then I think about my mother and, I don't know, for all her expectations, she could be very kind and understanding.  It's just she was so reserved I didn't dare very often go to her.  I suppose that's it.  In a way that's happening now with my present supervisor.  For all that I feel we could agree and how much easier it would be for me to work things out with her than with anybody else I've ever worked for, I've tried many times to go to her on various problems.  In fact, today I tried to on the very problem of just saying to her, "I'm feeling just so confused.  I can't just start making changes and I feel I have to talk to you more about it."  And I wanted to just go into this a little and she's always too busy, which gives me the feeling that priorities are different for her.  And it's kind of the same thing that used to happen with my mother, that either my mother was off being busy or else somehow she had a certain reserve about her that made her inapproachable.  And I'm feeling the same way now with this woman.  I have to keep fighting it.
In fact, I think I'm now beginning to become quite cynical in my mind on what she does mean when she says things.  And I don't want to get this way because that's, I think, a defensive thing.  I don't think it's really true.  (Silence) It's funny, I was thinking about, again, this dilemma I've put myself in and wondering how much I should be seeking help and trying to make somebody set up expa—, expectations so I don't have to make decisions, and how much I shouldn't be and this compulsion I have right now to make up my own mind, although I can't seem to be a—, I'm not able to do it (laughs).  And it made me think of a time in high school when my english teacher, who had me for 2 years, once said something about my not having the strength of my own convictions.  I, maybe I've even said this comment before here.  I've forgotten how he worded it but in any case it made me feel that I never stated my opinions.  And I can see now that it's probably not at all what he meant but I became very forceful in different discussions on literature and things, of saying my opinion, thinking, "Well, this will make up for it."  Or, "Now I'm not going to be that way any longer.  "  (Pause) I think maybe that what I want most is just the feeling that I can know what I want and how I think on educational problems so, even if I'm following directives from my supervisor, that I know I feel in relationship to them and whether or not I think they're right.  Or so that I'm in the position to discuss them with her and work out a better way if I don't feel that they're completely right. (Pause)
Because that's the other thing that I'm losing, the belief that any one thing is right.  Which makes me feel I'm floundering around even more.  (2-minute silence) And I think, uhm, something I, I don't know if I mentioned this yesterday but I know I was thinking about it last night.  Another thing that has made me feel so distressed at having the supervisor, in effect say, "  do much more of what you believe is right in where we agree."  Uhm, because before I could do what was expected and know I was meeting those goals and I knew I could do that part well enough until I began to just not believe in it.  And I could interject little things that I thought would be good for the children without fully understanding it so I never really completely did those things either.  But I could always do it in a way that it was kind of sneaking them into the program and if they didn't work out it wouldn't bother anybody except me, if it bothered me.  And it wouldn't show and, I don't know, it just wouldn't matter.  And so I wasn't going to be accountable for anything.  And the way things are developing, although on the one hand it's quite exciting, I'm I'll be accountable for much more.  And I think it's, that's part of what's distressing me so much.
ANALYST: And that leaves you worrying, then, about what damage you might do to the boys.
PATIENT:  Well, if I think that, it's I might think it honestly but I think I'm worrying (laughs) more about myself and what other people will think the damage is I've done to the boys.  Or I don't, I just don't know because sometimes I'm honestly upset if I think I have but (sighs) I think always it's involved with thinking somebody else is going to think it and that's what's the much more distressing thing.
ANALYST: Somebody else will think you've hurt the boys.
PATIENT:  Yes, because I think I really believe that I might not do as much with them or help them as much as I perhaps could but it's only when I'm having real problems with myself so that I'm just in a bad mood, I guess that's the best way to put it, with them that I think I might hurt them temporarily.  And I don't know, I don't think I treat them in any way that would be permanently damaging.
ANALYST: But someone might think so, you're afraid.
PATIENT:  Well, that and just not fulfilling the potential that was there, I guess, which does bother me too.  (Pause) I don't know how I feel about damaging the boys when you raise that.  Because I think I'm, when I think about the possibility of damaging them I'm also thinking in terms of what they need at LKC for the rest of the years they're there.  And however well I could set up a program or work out a program with my supervisor, what they get after the year with me is something entirely different because they go right back into the structured program again and being treated the way I, if I did it, then I could worry that maybe I was damaging them.  So then I'll think, well, it won't matter.
ANALYST: Hmm.  Well, our time's up.
