<b>DR:</b> How are you doing [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it feels about the same.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-oh.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] appointments with you, and I've rescheduled them, because I just don't feel like, like I don't want to be outside and, um, I don't know, I just kind of feel like I don't care, I don't know and not care, you know, so -
<b>DR:</b> Depressed and, and this time your depression, you said, how long you been depressed this time?
<b>PT:</b> Feels like about four years.  Course it hadn't, but for the last two was when, you know, I can't function, you know.  Like, they'll be everyday things, you know, getting up, going to get something eat, and, functioning.
<b>DR:</b> And, you were getting any help from your family doctor, or how did you?
<b>PT:</b> Um, doctor, uh, like I said I took some Ambien, took too many Ambien, uh, to try to go to sleep, because I don't sleep, and um, like right now it's, feels like midgets are sitting on my shoulders because, I just, I don't sleep, I don't know why.  But, um, I went to the, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], which is my family doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh, she said, she started me on some Cymbalta.  And, you know, make an appointment with you if those didn't work.  I still couldn't sleep with those.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And that's when, you know, I started with you, coming over here.
<b>DR:</b> So, you really are getting help for last two weeks.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> You never did get any -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Help.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Because I never wanted to admit I had a problem.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> I never wanted to say I had a problem or -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Your problem didn't go away.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I thought maybe I'm just going through a phase, and you know, but it's not a phase.  I'm not a, I want to function.  I want to go to work, you know, and be normal, because I don't feel normal now.
<b>DR:</b> And you've not been able to work since how long?
<b>PT:</b> I haven't worked in two years, you know.  And maybe this, well my last job was, I kind of laid in the bed and didn't get up.  And, you know, they didn't want to fire me, but I just couldn't stop crying, I, you know, I didn't eat.  I used to weight like 300 pounds.  I've lost, like 60 some pounds.  And I'm not trying to exercise.  I just don't eat.
<b>DR:</b> You don't feel hungry, don't have interest in food, or what?
<b>PT:</b> I don't feel hungry.  I don't feel hungry at all.  You know, I have a horrible headache, that'll make me eat something.  But other than that I just, just feel worthless basically all the time.  And sometimes I feel like, you know, my thoughts get so racy and jumbled up, it's like I want to ask people, "Can you hear this?"  Because, you know, my heart start beating real fast, and I feel like I'm shaking, and -
<b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> I have to sit down and take deep breaths and, you know.  I used to be a really social person, you know.  I'm the strong one in the family, well I used to be anyway.  Take care of everybody, and I never took care of myself, and I, I guess it all came to a head, you know, in the last couple of years.  So, now I don't want to go anywhere.  I don't, you know, I barely talk on the phone.  You know, I just, every day it feels like I'm fighting to just get up and say, "Hello," and, you know, even speak to my son.  And my, I have a son who's still at home, and it's, every day it's like fighting through, fighting just to even be up around, you know.  And, I don't know what's with me.  It just wouldn't go away.
<b>DR:</b> Any crying spells?
<b>PT:</b> All the time.  All the time.
<b>DR:</b> How is your energy?
<b>PT:</b> None.  No energy.  And, you know, I used to be -
<b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> I'm not saying that I was, you know, pretty clean.  I'm still a pretty good, clean person, but I used to overclean and, um, I lay in the bed all day long.  I might go to the living room and sit there for a little while, you know, with the curtains drawn and, I don't know.  It is different, and I don't know what happened.
<b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].  What are your hobbies?  Do you take interest in your hobbies or lost that, too?
<b>PT:</b> Cooking was my hobby.  [INAUDIBLE], you know.  I just don't like to cook or nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Now how much to you weigh?  You said lost 66 pounds?  How much do you weigh?
<b>PT:</b> I weigh about 240 now.
<b>DR:</b> And how tall are you?
<b>PT:</b> 5'11".
<b>DR:</b> Any, do you hear any voices or you just have so many thoughts that make you confused and [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> So many thoughts.  It's, it's not voices.  I mean, you know, I don't hear people talking to me.  It's just so many thoughts at one time, until, you know, I just wish I could make it stop.
<b>DR:</b> Do ever feel like you will kill yourself?
<b>PT:</b> I do.  I've, you know, but, like I say, if I didn't have kids, and you know, my grand baby, I probably would.  Really, I just don't want to hurt them, you know, it would [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].  So, when you took a lot of Ambien, it was not in an attempt to kill yourself.  It was attempt just to retire.
<b>PT:</b> No.  I just wanted to go to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Wanted to sleep.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Because I feel like I'm being tortured, because I don't, you know.  Just to fall asleep like a normal person.  "Oh, I'm tired.  I want to go to sleep."  That doesn't happen with me.  I have to medicate myself.  I'll take so many Tylenol PMs until, I could take six of them, and I won't be sleepy.  I can walk around, you know, and I won't be sleepy.  So -
<b>DR:</b> That can make you tired the next day.
<b>PT:</b> I am immune to those now.  I just want to get to a place where I can, you know, function.  Go to work, you know.  Spend time with my grandson.  Normal, like I used to be.
<b>DR:</b> Nothing unusual has happened for you to be depressed?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> It runs in your family?
<b>PT:</b> Um, no, not really.  No.
<b>DR:</b> Brother or sister, mom, dad?
<b>PT:</b> Um, no.  I, um, I, me and my mom don't have a good relationship, and you know, I've always struggled with that, but it's never gotten to the point where, you know, I can't.  I'm independent, and, well I used to be strong, and, I just don't know what happened.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> So you live alone right, you live with your child now, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Me and my son.  I have three children.  Um, my oldest son is the one still in the home.  And, I have a son who lives here, and my daughter who's [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> She's in college or she's at home?
<b>PT:</b> No, she's moved out, course she lives with her boyfriend.  So it's just me and my son.  So.
<b>DR:</b> So how do you maintain, I mean, financially what do you do?
<b>PT:</b> Um, right now I live in the -
<b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> Apartments where I rent, my rent is free, and I get a, um, check from the housing authority.  So, basically, I don't have any kind of, you know, and my mom helps out.  Excuse me.
<b>DR:</b> Last time when I saw you, that is the only time, of course, you were ca, talking about wanting to die and think about do, death all the time.  Is that still there?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And in my heart I really don't want to die, it's just, God, it just seems so hard right now.  It's like I know -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And like I don't, the, they [INAUDIBLE] I just don't see, you know, I don't [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> You, you see that the only, only way out.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Right?  Yeah.  I see you have problem with blood pressure, too, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, ma'am.
<b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].  So, are you and your mom doing better now or?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Not really.  I just, you know, I won't fight with her, so I kind of just let it be, you know.  I was raised in, I didn't live with her when I was young.  I lived with my grandma.  And I just never felt, really felt like she didn't, you know, she didn't want me.  She just handed me to my grandma.  But, you know, like I said I've, normally, my entire life I've been able to deal with it, you know, I don't -
<b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> I don't let it bother me as much, you know, but, I don't know.  I don't know if it's a chemical out of balance.  I don't know what it is, but I just feel crazy all the time.
<b>DR:</b> So why was then that you stayed with your mo, your grandmother and not your mom?  Was she busy working, or -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And is there drug or alcohol with your mom or dad?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Do you know anything else about your father, biological father?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I know who he is, but I've never had, you know, a relationship with him or anything.
<b>DR:</b> So, you and, you have other two siblings.  Right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, ma'am.
<b>DR:</b> They are by same dad or different?
<b>PT:</b> No, different dads.
<b>DR:</b> So, they stayed with your mom and -
<b>PT:</b> And I stayed with my grandma.  And then I, well she died when I was [AGE].  And I had to come back home, and it didn't work.  So, I moved out when I was [AGE].  You know, I had a baby when I was [AGE].  It's, it's like, I grew up real fast.  So, and, uh, when I moved out when I was [AGE] the end of our relationship was very violent, very, very violent.
<b>DR:</b> Physical?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And he's the father of your baby?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  Of my oldest son.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah.  So you raised all three of them on your own?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Really.
<b>PT:</b> I never got help.  You know, I'm not saying as if they were on the, you know, welfare or something like that, but I never got help.  I did it by myself, you know.
<b>DR:</b> So, you pretty much worked [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I, I always worked.  I always worked.
<b>DR:</b> Except for last two years.
<b>PT:</b> The last two years I haven't worked.  I haven't worked.  And the last job I was on I was like, and I could feel it, something different with me [INAUDIBLE] I would be worried, and it's like, start crying.  You know, just feel sluggish, and I don't want to be there.  And I was in a, a somewhat, um, supervisory position.  So -
<b>DR:</b> Where was that at?
<b>PT:</b> It, my last job was at [DEIDENTIFIED].  They shred paperwork, documentation.  And, um, I just, I felt it coming on then, but I just never thought, you know, I'm going through a phase, and -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  For how long you work for them?
<b>PT:</b> Almost a year.  I was there almost a year.  It just, it progressively got worse.  And so, now I second guess everything.  Like I said I had an interview.  You know, I was glad, you know.  I felt good, and, I'm going to get back to work, get back to normal.  Uh-huh.  As the day got closer, I felt worse and worse and worse and, and I'm not a lazy person, you know.  I don't like to ask for help.  You know, I don't like to admit that have a problem, but.
<b>DR:</b> So it take you a lot to come to me.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But then, you didn't come back for two visits.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Right?  You looking for a job now, or?  Any luck?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Just, I mean, you know, with the interview that I just told you about, but -
<b>DR:</b> So, [INAUDIBLE] reschedule mine.
<b>PT:</b> Because I don't, I don't know.  I just felt like, like I said, right now I'm here, I don't even want to be outside.  I'd rather stay in the house, in the dark, and just be there.
<b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].  So you've been on that Cym, you didn't, you have not missed your Cymbalta at all?
<b>PT:</b> No.  You gave me another pill to replace the Cymbalta.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But I can't tell if that worked.  Like I said, the only that I felt like worked, um -
<b>DR:</b> Celexa.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Was the Ativan.
<b>DR:</b> Now are you taking Ativan?
<b>PT:</b> No.  The, I ran, I'm out of those.
<b>DR:</b> How many did you take?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I could take up to three a day, and I took the three a day.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, but did you take the Celexa I gave you last time?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  I did.
<b>DR:</b> And you just took it for, until you are done, and then you never did take anything?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So, you are not on anything right now?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How long you been without any medicine?
<b>PT:</b> Um.  Oh, almost about two weeks, two or three weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I'm glad you came.
<b>PT:</b> That's why I came.  I thought, "Oh, gosh."  And that, you know, my mom brought me here today.  Because I don't even like to drive.  And um, I was telling her that I felt like I couldn't breath and my heart was beating all fast, and I was just panicky.
<b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I was like, I've got to go to the doctor.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So, you started having panic attacks.  Yeah.  Now you've on Ativan.  How long have you been on it?
<b>PT:</b> You gave me a month's supply.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Was that the first time you started on that, and it did help?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know what?  I mean, Celexa also will help, but it takes a while.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You didn't have any problem with Celexa, did you?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Well, uh, let me explain to you the important thing about depression and medication.  Those medication are not like you're in an infection that you took for 10 days, and you got better, and you don't need it any more.  Antidepressant has to be taken regularly.  And sometimes it might six weeks or eight weeks, or sometimes three months before you can really tell it's going to help.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So, if you did not have any problem with Celexa, let's just give you that back again.  We may have to go up, but then again, I have to start back again because we don't know, if you will come for weeks we would have decided, uh, that we should go up, do different thing or whatever.  So, I'm going to start there as if we are starting all over again.  This time I hope you stay with it.  Take the medication as prescribed.  If you have any problem, just give me a buzz -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Here, any time.  Any problem, I'll answer anything, if there is any side effects of medicine I will explain to you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.-
<b>DR:</b> So, that's number one.  I'm going to give you the Ativan, and you use as needed.  You can take as many as four a day.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, also I'm going to give you Desyrel, it's a trazodone.  It's an antidepressant, but it also helps you to sleep.  And that I'm going to give, so you, it looks like, "Oh my God.  Am I taking three different kind of medicine?"  Right now, you may have to do that to get you at least functioning some better, and then maybe cut back.  First medicine to go would be the Ativan, because it's addicting drug.  You need to take medication, because the thing with depression is when you're getting worse, and like, you know, you got an interview, then rescheduled, you had an appointment with me twice, and you cancelled.  You take your person hygiene, like bath, and change, and, uh, or neglect the personal hygiene?
<b>PT:</b> I neglect it.
<b>DR:</b> You neglect that?  How many, how often do you take a bath?
<b>PT:</b> Oh.  This is really embarrassing, uh, maybe every three days.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's all right.  Maybe that's part of your symptoms.  You don't have to be, now that, those are the important things.  So, I want you to do that.  Take the medication.  I can see you in about two weeks, and, just to reinforce what we are doing.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And go from there.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I would want you to, I'm still encouraging you to get you a sleep study done, too.  So -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But we will, I mean, do you think you would come if I tell, if they did the scheduling?
<b>PT:</b> If it will help we get some rest, I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].  Okay.  Why don't I see you in two weeks and then we'll see how you are doing on that medicine.  And then we'll do the sleep study, too.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  Will that work?
<b>PT:</b> That'll work.
<b>DR:</b> Stay with us.
<b>PT:</b> I will.
