[00:00:24]
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: So, yesterday the IRS levied my bank account and took twenty five thousand dollars, well the bank holds it for twenty one days. And um, I have in addition to a check to my landlord for twenty eight hundred bucks, a bunch of checks I had written based on my closing which I can deposit money and it won't get levied until they decide to levy it again, but it was a pretty rough day yesterday. [00:01:03]
THERAPIST: Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.
CLIENT: So, try calling the IRS on the day before taxes are due. And the people I talked to before were like really nice and sympathetic and you know they would extend the hold on collections and this woman was just didn't care.
I'm like I got a one year old daughter how's she supposed to eat? Can you explain that to me you know? She's like, well you can apply for a hardship. I go that's my problem, applying for a hardship has been a hardship for me. I didn't get anywhere with her, I called my lawyer and left a message for him. Basically he had called and how you know, I don't know what he did but he said, he left a message and said you know, one side wasn't talking to the other and he, I don't know I have the greatest of faith in this guy you know.
So now I have to gotta fucking do all the paperwork and apply and if they consider it a hardship they'll give the money back, or some of the money back. [00:02:21]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: But now I gotta do all the fucking paperwork. Jess's like well, is there anything I can do? It's like yeah fill out the fucking forms for me, can you do that? And I can't get her to get the simplest of information to file our taxes.
You know you get a childcare deduction, but you need the social security number and address of the provider. She's like, I text her last night, have you gotten in touch with Emma? She's like no I just, I've texted her twice. It's like pick up the fucking phone and call her, you know? The thing is due today. It's like five thousand, I don't know what the limit is, but it's five thousand dollars worth of childcare expenses for Lucille. [00:03:12]
THERAPIST: Right, that's a lot of money.
CLIENT: You know? The only thing I can account for is fifteen hundred dollars, which I, I don't know what the limit is, but still you know? It's just a really fucking shitty day.
THERAPIST: I bet.
CLIENT: At first I was like, you know, I'm not gonna go to free city and stay at the office and try to get this fucking thing done, but it's like I mentally couldn't you know wrap my hands around it and get it done. I pulled it out and I looked at it, I'm like, she's like you can apply over the phone, I was like I still don't have the stuff together you know?
So at least I went and played Handball you know? I almost killed myself, I had this pain in my rib cage, you know, I had trouble breathing because of this, it's like the muscle just kind of started spasming like it's almost like it just seized up. [00:04:14]
THERAPIST: That doesn't sound good.
CLIENT: No, it's like I'm not in shape. Where'd the fuck, luckily I already ordered the cage for Buddy, so that money is spent. You know? But I put a hundred dollars into the account so I could go get my medicine. And sure enough I had an automatic withdrawal from the bank, so like there's twenty five bucks I don't have access to for a few days. You know, so I left a message with Jess, if you have money that I could borrow, let me know you know I mean.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I'm, I just don't know what to do at this point. I can't call my parents. I saw my landlord last night at the bar, and it's like this isn't the place I should be telling you but you shouldn't cash the check. So I gotta send him an e-mail today, the check you're holding for two months worth of rent, from two months ago, if you could hold that until I straighten things out with the IRS. I still haven't paid him for this month. [00:05:29]
THERAPIST: Isn't the twenty one thousand essentially, like, aren't you ponying that up for Jess essentially if you're filing jointly.
CLIENT: You mean the twenty four hundred?
THERAPIST: I'm sorry whatever the...
CLIENT: Yeah, that's part of Jess's taxes too. So, it never gets looked at that way you know? She has no clue that I'm paying for auto insurance, for life insurance and now, twenty five hundred bucks gone, twenty four hundred bucks gone you know? I'm just lucky that I've gotten a few things starting to bubble you know. A couple purchases in June, in May and June, a couple of refi's and I actually have a couple of people coming in on Friday to be an eye for a financial planners seat. So it's an actual competition to be in our group.
But still there's a lag time. It doesn't help me today. I was beat up before this happened and now it's just like. I gotta go to the office today and open three files that should have been opened last week get that done and out of the way. Then I have to sit here and crunch numbers and fill out this fucking application. You know? [00:07:18]
THERAPIST: How bad is it?
CLIENT: Well it's like figuring out your household expenses, which is, you know, I don't know what fucking Jess spends on stuff, I'm gonna see stuff for Target, I'm gonna see stuff for CVS.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I have no fucking clue, she did her household expenses for me awhile ago and I'm gonna see if that matches up. But it's just. It's only a matter of before the state comes after me as well, so it's like. You know and I'm an idiot because every, when I call them and they go what bank account are you using and I told them this bank account instead of the old bank account. It's just my own fucking fault. So instead of owing them ninety thousand, I now owe them eighty seven thousand five hundred, six hundred. [00:08:23]
You know? It just, just cuz I can't fucking get paperwork done, they gave me until April six and I just can't fucking focus on it and I have to. I'm just.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, we're paying this fucking attorney, I don't know what he's gonna do you know? Kind of the idea that I wouldn't have to do all this myself, but I'm doing it all myself. [00:08:59]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: The dog crate is gonna come just in time for the weather to get cooler and at least I can start riding my bike. Because gas has been a huge expense for me you know? All those short trips that I could be making on my bike, you know, running over to CVS, running over to see the kids. And I've gotta do this shit today because tomorrow I'm supposed to take Ian to yoga camp and watch the baby all morning. So it's like if I don't get it done today, it's not gonna get fucking done. [00:09:48]
I fucked up this title. You know, I didn't get a copy of the plan, and on the plan was a sewer easement. So I'm like, oh I neglected to do that, sorry. So who knows if they're gonna hold that against me, or... I still owe them one more; I'm supposed to get them Friday. I went into the office yesterday and did one and never sent it to them. So I sent it to them today. (exhale) [00:10:27]
(pause)
Buddy's medicine is fifty bucks a month, I asked the doctor and he was like it will be only twenty dollars. My god it's over fifty bucks a month. And my medication is, I probably spend a hundred dollars a month for myself. I just spent sixty bucks yesterday and that didn't cover everything so it's gotta be close to a hundred bucks for me. [00:11:31]
THERAPIST: Wow.
(pause)
THERAPIST: That's the out of pocket part? [00:11:54]
CLIENT: Yeah, the co pay. I mean when you add it all up together it's still not enough to get a deduction on your taxes you know?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
pause at [00:12:13] to [00:12:37]
CLIENT: They did a levy for like forty thousand when they sent it to the bank, it was for forty thousand. They got twenty four hundred which I can hopefully get back. It's like I just don't even know what to do now. As far as managing the finances, juggling you know. It's like I haven't paid malpractice this month. By the end of the month we're gonna have to pay friggin health insurance which is you know, fifteen hundred bucks.
I just made a thousand dollars, which I just had to pull out to pay fucking co pays and then twenty five gets sucked up by the bank, I gotta stop that automatic withdrawal. I probably have like a hundred dollars sitting there, but.
pause at [00:13:45] to [00:14:23]
I finally got my ball game tickets and realized that I had tickets; on Sunday I realized I had tickets for Saturday and Sunday. So that was eight of my tickets, two hundred dollars down the drain. Cuz I haven't picked up my tickets yet. I have tickets for tonight but I was able to sell them. For some reason I thought later in the month was my first game.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: It's like I'm trying to find uh, trying to find the positives in life but I can't. And Ian was a fucking nightmare, I don't want him spending the night over anymore, I can't take it. [00:15:19]
THERAPIST: Yeah what happened?
CLIENT: We got home from practice and I said before you go you know downstairs, we were down stairs take off your cleats and your soccer stuff. And he's like no, and just runs into the apartment. And then he came again and I said, take off your cleats, because my concern was he gonna take them it in their apartment and in the morning they'd be gone when we wanted to get them. [00:15:49]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: You know, like it'd be locked in there. So I asked him twice, and he didn't listen to me. There was a whole bunch of other things I asked him to do, he didn't listen to me and um, Jess had to come get him in the morning. It was just, you know.
THERAPIST: You mean you're just cooked.
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm just and then he finally comes upstairs, we went to the restaurant after dinner so we spent some time at the restaurant after soccer practice. And then he comes upstairs when the other kids go to bed and wants to watch you know, Two and a Half Men, and I'm like it's not on. He's like well what's on TV? I'm like there's nothing on TV; I can't remember what I put on. Oh, Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Vandyke and Bob Newhart show. A fucking six year old kid sitting there going what the fuck is this? [00:16:54]
I tried to explain to him how Bob Newhart was the elf and elf was the dad, you know that movie with Will Farrell?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I've seen like bits and pieces of it.
CLIENT: Yeah, he was in this one scene where this little tiny Bob Newhart has big Will Farrell sitting on his lap you know?
THERAPIST: I see, yeah.
CLIENT: So I'm trying like to get him to recognize that, and then he falls asleep, so it's not like I'm getting any sort of interaction with him or it's not like he's getting any kind of interaction from me. He's not coming over to spend time with me.
He wakes up in the morning and he's like can I go downstairs, I'm like dude it's six o'clock you can't go downstairs. And then he finally goes downstairs a couple times and the second or third time they're awake. And then he wants to go upstairs at eight thirty and bother Rachael, and I'm like you can't go upstairs and wake someone up at eight thirty, and he went up there anyways. And I told him I was taking the dog for a walk. And Jess texted me what we were doing. And I'm like I just can't fucking take it anymore. I do not want him, I can't handle him spending the night, it's just not worth it for me. [00:18:17]
THERAPIST: If you can't do it, you can't do it. How is it when you're up together?
CLIENT: He's fine. He was fine at the restaurant, he actually behaved during soccer practice. You know I think getting all mad and telling Jess that she had to watch him two Fridays ago, just kind of sunk in with him. He may have turned the game.
You know, I'm fucking pissed off because I want the kids to not touch the fucking ball bag, pull out the cones, and pull shit out. I take balls out for them to play with. He took two cones at practice two weeks ago and put, we're at the game and put one on each side of the goal, and then I'm watching he's putting everything in the bag and I'm like he's being helpful. But he didn't put those two fucking cones, I didn't pay attention, I've lost two fucking cones you know? [00:19:48]
It's like I had to bother the equipment coordinator for another set of cones. It's just I get totally nothing, absolutely nothing out of fucking soccer practice. It's like a fucking chore to me, everything is a chore to me. Now the games at least for the next week, last week, next week and the week after, there's a woman from Soccer and she gives us a lesson plan where we have to take them to these little activities and then play a game, you know. [00:20:34]
I've got this one fucking kid that I just want to smack across the mouth. He wants to do it, I'm first, I'm on the first line, I want to kick the ball you know? I'm like kid, you're not on the first line, you're not, you know, not, it's just like just shut the fuck up you know? It's like lining up, lining up to shake hands, he wants to stand in front of me, you know coach is the first one. I feel bad for his dad, you know, his dad does help. His dad owns one of the restaurants downtown, you know, knows the Mayor, hangs out with the Alderman every week. It's just this kid is driving me fucking crazy, just shut the fuck up, and you know, do what you're told. [00:21:35]
THERAPIST: Mmhm.
CLIENT: So then Sunday I was just so bored, texting Jess to what they were doing just trying to meet up with them, I can't remember what they were doing and I went over there about like three or four. It's just, you know she makes food and she gives it to the kids and I just sit there. And she's like oh there's some leftovers if you want it. It's not like, here's some for you, here's some for the kids you know, I gotta sit there and watch the kids eat you know. I was expecting chicken nuggets and tortellinis, but still it's like...
You know either, it's just, just I'm not treated like a house guest would be treated you know? And I don't feel comfortable just going over and taking food you know? I remember, I met them for ice cream, they were wanting ice cream and then she's like we're going to the shop and I was like why don't you go to the other place and I can meet you guys. So I met them for ice cream. Then Ian wanted me to come back over to their house. [00:23:35]
Pause at [00:23:44] to [00:24:13]
I haven't gotten an e-mail from my CPA in twelve hours which means they've probably stopped asking me for stuff, except for the child care crap.
THERAPIST: I guess in terms of Ian asking you to come over and wanting to spend time at your place, uh, maybe he's coming around.
CLIENT: No I understand that, but you know there's you know, the fifth time I ask him to close the door it drives me crazy.
THERAPIST: Oh I understand.
CLIENT: You know? And he's not over there to see me. You know he spends the vast majority of time with the kids. They go to bed, he comes up and he wants to watch TV. I mean I have no doubt he wants to spend time with me but, you know spending time with me there has to be some sort of you know, obedience. I mean it's just, I can't remember all the different things he did not listen to me about. [00:25:25]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
Pause at [00:25:25] to [00:25:57]
CLIENT: (Sigh)
Pause at [00:26:04] to [00:26:37]
CLIENT: Nothing wrong with the shit and chase me through the modification and I haven't even asked Jess for a (pause)
THERAPIST: That modification thing is unbelievable. I mean they've been asking for stuff for about five months at this point?
CLIENT: At least, and it will all be for naught. I mean that's the you know? I wish they would take the fucking house, you know? Jess's got a cashier's check for like eight thousand dollars, don't fucking cry me a river about you have nowhere to go. You have to go live with your parents, are you fucking kidding me? You've got first, you've got last and security deposit right there you know? The rest of the world seems to find places to live you know?
She goes on Craigslist and looks for two minutes and says oh I can't find a place. I don't want to deal with that when it fucking comes down the pipe. I haven't heard anything on the short sale at all. She just gets a voice-mail they don't return calls. It's kinda good cuz I'm getting rent. [00:28:23]
THERAPIST: Right.
Pause at [00:28:23] to [00:29:16]
CLIENT: I'm just at my limit. I'm beyond my limit.
THERAPIST: Yeah you sound pretty wrecked.
Pause at [00:29:21] to [00:29:50]
THERAPIST: And very much on your own. (pause) On pretty much all of it.
Pause at [00:30:05] to [00:31:26]
THERAPIST: It can't be easy to just get out of bed in the morning; to keep yourself going in any way. (pause) Or to get yourself to do anything that you've got to do I would imagine.
Pause at [00:31:44] to [00:32:18]
THERAPIST: I imagine just getting going takes all you've got and maybe more.
CLIENT: Most of the time.
Pause at [00:32:24] to [00:32:39]
THERAPIST: You said the only thing really keeping you around was the kids. (pause) Is that right? Without them you'd be dead?
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Just.
Pause at [00:33:11] to [00:33:44]
(sniffling)
Pause at [00:33:44] to [00:35:23]
THERAPIST: You know, it reminds me you go for the kids and hoping that you know, at some time down the road things will be better and more manageable although you're not at all clear how you're gonna get from here to there.
Pause at [00:35:37] to [00:37:55]
THERAPIST: So what's on your mind?
CLIENT: Just don't even know where to start. I'm thinking about there's this guy that plays basketball at the University of Florida, Duane Chansis, top player to ever play there, he was like a back up for the New Jersey Nets. And uh, he had leukemia and just died the other day. He was forty two, forty two, yeah.
Pause at [00:38:54] to [00:40:34]
THERAPIST: You know, [inaudible at 00:40:33]
Pause at [00:40:36] to [00:41:02]
THERAPIST: In some ways it's a whole lot easier than this.
Pause at [00:41:03] to [00:41:52]
CLIENT: (Sigh) I'm wondering where the dog lives. He'll be maybe at their place.
THERAPIST: Mmhm.
Pause at [00:42:02] to [00:42:36]
THERAPIST: We've got about a minute or two left, we should talk schedule. I think we were gonna try for something at the end of the week?
