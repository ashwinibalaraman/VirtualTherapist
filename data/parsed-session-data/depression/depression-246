BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	I almost got it memorized.
<b>PT:</b>	That's a lot to say.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, what's happening?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, since we met last, what's been happening, keeping busy with mom and my sister.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Is that a full time job now or what?
<b>PT:</b>	Almost, I'll tell you.  You know doc, I almost feel like turning the key and moving there.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no, don't do that.
<b>PT:</b>	Why?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you know if you—
<b>PT:</b>	I know—
<b>DR:</b>	People that are dependent on you, the more you do, the more they will take.  At some point, you've got to say, look, that's all I can do, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	They're both not helpless in the, they don't drive—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I know but—
<b>PT:</b>	And there's a lot of medical issues with them, with my sister and my mother.  I almost lost my mother a year before my father.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  Well—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, [NAME OTHER] is not too healthy, I don't know why.  I'm okay but it seems like, I don't know, for the past week and a half, I would say, I've been falling into the pattern of not getting up bright eyed and busy tailed and sleeping and without meaning to, sitting down to watch a movie early, 7:00, boom.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, the question is, are you feeling depressed or—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Fatigued.
<b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b>	Burnt out.
<b>PT:</b>	My mind is more tired than my body so if my mind is tired, I guess my body is.
<b>DR:</b>	That's called burnt out, that's, see how I covered both things.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know if it's tendinitis, uh, the elbow hurts extremely and then it flows through here, so we're trying this on and off for a while.  Uh, I've gone up to see [NAME OTHER], um, I brought his tack home to clean and get it ready to work with him.
<b>DR:</b>	That's good.
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	That's motivation.
<b>PT:</b>	I need to do it because [NAME OTHER] just told me I need to get rid of everything.  I need to get rid of my horse, I need to get rid of my dog.  She said I'll get rid of you before I get rid of my dog, I said who do you think—
<b>DR:</b>	Why did he say that?
<b>PT:</b>	Sleeps here at night and guards your son and me.  Just out of, things that come off the top of his head, to hurt me, to be with nothing, to be punished.
<b>DR:</b>	What about these other properties, does he—
<b>PT:</b>	It isn't the end of the world—
<b>DR:</b>	Are they rented out?
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, we're both the east side but at opposite corners and when I ask him, doctor, when we're talking civil, which we have been, I've made a tremendous effort not to upset him—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay but I did upset him, but I had to do what I had to do.
<b>DR:</b>	About the animals.
<b>PT:</b>	His credit card.  He sends us our money for the month in like 3 or 2, uh, payments, how can I say it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, that's a way to say it.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, now my young son has understood why it's so difficult for me to keep up with [NAME OTHER] and the bills because the way he does things.  It's not that he doesn't pay them but when they say your water is due such and such, okay, and the money from last month was late in coming, I went to the dentist on, uh, when the heck was it, I was all swollen and all he did was open it up, hopefully, we can get away without a root canal, all right—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So we don't know anything about each other's life, we're becoming more and more distant, the weekend telephone calls, I left it, I said let's see if he'll call, why should I be the one that calls all the time.  He calls, you know, but he didn't call this weekend but I told him last week, he goes how come you're not asking me for money, I said because I'm going to let you grow up, you know what date it is, you know that the bills are here, I already have the water bill, it's due [DATE], today is [DATE], the money isn't even here.
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, so this doubles up the bills, you understand, by going late.
<b>DR:</b>	How's he send it, a check to the house or to the bank?
<b>PT:</b>	He has an account with my son and mails it to his, to, my young son's [AGE], he'll be [AGE], account and then [NAME OTHER] takes it out from there and we pay our bills, you know, but now it's like he—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, if he used the same bank, like a big bank—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Like Bank of America.
<b>PT:</b>	Bank of America, no problem.
<b>DR:</b>	He could make the deposit up there—
<b>PT:</b>	That's what he does.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	That's what, that's how we do it doc.
<b>DR:</b>	And how do you find out, do you call the bank or—
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, [NAME OTHER], when he says we wired it at 9:00 this morning, he'll go at the end of school—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, he tells you.
<b>PT:</b>	Right but his own son has seen his, uh, inconsistency, okay, but he does come through but inconsistent, so when they told me they were turning their water off because the bill had crossed and doubled—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	The next day I had to pay by 5, I had $5 in the, my pocket, that's all I have.  I have $15, that's all I have, I just, what's the price of gas up there?  Do you know that we agreed on this amount 4 years ago, 4 years ago and I haven't asked you for more, only when it's necessary to fix something or whatever.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I wasn't, 4 years ago, I wasn't in psychotherapy, so you're looking at $700 more with the medicines, okay, I just, a month that you've done nothing about.  You haven't given me more, okay, your son is growing, he's using the car, he puts in his gas—
<b>DR:</b>	And gas has tripled.
<b>PT:</b>	I need 100 bucks, I says and where do I go, my mothers and home and now I'm starting to get up to [NAME OTHER], I hope I can keep it up, I haven't yet, uh, ridden him I've worked with him.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You have to do that after a long period of rest, you just don't hop on, you've got to work them this way, work them that way, develop, because he's older.  Um—
<b>DR:</b>	I'm thinking maybe you ought to make a budget and send it to him.
<b>PT:</b>	We did that, my father did that.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	My father did that because he started sending, the last, I don't remember, my father would send him an itemized—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Of all the bills, he did it twice.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, he's not stupid.  You're not cutting off of me to make up for your mishaps.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, the damn electric bill is higher.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's 250 doc.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Two thirty.  I said electricity has gone up.
<b>DR:</b>	It used to be about 160, 170.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  And he goes to me, go out and get a job.  I said, you know what, you can slam your ass on the ground, you can pout, you can cry like a spoiled little child, have a tantrum in the middle of [DEIDENTIFIED], I will never get a job, you know why, because your brother's whore doesn't work and your brother's other whore doesn't work, so why should I work, I'm your whore, why should I work, for you, you put us in this debt to get you out of this debt, sell everything, I'm ready to turn the key.  I hope lightening strikes it, I really do, do you know how I feel.
<b>DR:</b>	You should tell him you're totally disabled.
<b>PT:</b>	I am, I told him, my doctor does not allow me and will not allow me until I make progress and right when I'm starting to make progress, you know what he told me today?
<b>DR:</b>	What?
<b>PT:</b>	Just to hurt me, it's been 6 months since dad passed, our Greek Orthodox religion, at 6 months you a special prayer and you take something to church that's divided up and given to the people.
<b>DR:</b>	Like what, food you mean or—
<b>PT:</b>	A special kind of little wheat things, they're called [INAUDIBLE], I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know in English what it's, barley, it's boiled with almonds and little things in there and sugar, it is for the soul—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	To wish them well, it's just tradition.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay and usually at 6 months you do a little thing and when the year closes, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, and he says to me, I says what'd you call to wish me for, uh, I said that it's been 6 months since your father in law died and you forgot, uh, and you're calling to tell me, because we usually, you know, address it—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], dads been gone six months, whatever.  I said, he goes to me, you used to swear at him and you used to disrespect him, listen to this, because there was one time I had one word with my father because I guess at the end he wasn't well, something was going on here, the pressure of not being able to provide, doctor, his retirement sucked, it wasn't a retirement, he didn't plan for it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I said what did you do for my father, because I took care of yours for 6 months because your mother was too busy, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Don't you tell me if I loved my father or not, that's inside me to know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, what is it with you, what are you trying to get even with your demons.  Doctor, there's no light at the end of the tunnel.  We haven't been touched, we have no physical contact, I think it's been a year.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So I don't, I have no feeling, even as a, and I wonder, it's probably a side effect of the medication, there's no feeling.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that could be too, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	There's no feeling.  If you have no other love, what am I going to do, sit and have feelings.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, he—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm miserable most of the time.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean you're right, you keep busy but you're miserable.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes and—
<b>DR:</b>	I told you about a year ago, sooner or later this ain't going to work.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.  It just, um, I'm realizing it for real now, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean he's sort of, I mean there's a saying—
<b>PT:</b>	Why won't he let me go, because it's cheaper to keep her.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'll fix him cheaper to keep her.  I'll fix him cheaper to cheaper.  I don't even know what he's done with that lot down in [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't know if he's given it over to his brother and he's made it into a—
<b>DR:</b>	Is there any way to contact—
<b>PT:</b>	That family?
<b>DR:</b>	No, no, no.
<b>PT:</b>	They don't talk to me.
<b>DR:</b>	It would be a county or something like that, do they register those things.
<b>PT:</b>	Of course, I have papers but they have made fake ones, I know them, you don't know what they do.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean I could go on a computer, certainly go down the courthouse and see.
<b>PT:</b>	In another country?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's what I mean, does your country have this?
<b>PT:</b>	Our country is messed up, there isn't anything right now.
<b>DR:</b>	No, it might be but maybe—
<b>PT:</b>	What do you want—
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe they have—
<b>PT:</b>	No leadership.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe they have some kind of registry that things have changed hands, that's what I'm saying.
<b>PT:</b>	Their government, they're in bad shape down there.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	The Euro is stronger than the dollar.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And you mean to tell me now that people are losing their houses like they're losing here, we're in a recession, face it.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, I agree.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, what comes after recession, depression?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we probably won't get that bad but—
<b>PT:</b>	How come?
<b>DR:</b>	We're not in good shape.
<b>PT:</b>	We've overspent doc, credit cards own us.  What can they do to you if you have a debt and you don't pay it off and nothing is in your name and it's your debt, what could they do to you.
<b>DR:</b>	You go bankrupt where you make it official so then they can't do anything.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, what else could they do, put me in jail?
<b>DR:</b>	No, I mean they can't take your house.
<b>PT:</b>	It's not mine.
<b>DR:</b>	But the feds can take your if they—
<b>PT:</b>	It's not mine.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  Well, they couldn't do anything but you probably don't have any personal debts, the water and the electric, is that in your name only?
<b>PT:</b>	Personal debts from before, um, when we first moved in, we had credit cards and all that from New York and—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	It's about 40 grand.  What can they do to me?
<b>DR:</b>	Is his name on it or just yours?
<b>PT:</b>	No, mine.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't think they can do anything.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I was never working, he was.
<b>DR:</b>	You don't work so they can't down your salary, they can't do anything to you, that's true.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm not—
<b>DR:</b>	What, you're crazy.  You don't have to worry about that.  Well, you have $40,000 just sitting out there?
<b>PT:</b>	In debt, yeah, oh a lawyer sent me money and stuff.  I attempted to start a, you know, like a 5 cents on the dollar deal thing, they way they—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But we, he filed, he puts me on his taxes, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	So it could come through to him.
<b>PT:</b>	It's not in his name.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't know what they do.
<b>PT:</b>	He's not authorized—
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe they—
<b>PT:</b>	To use any of them.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, then—
<b>PT:</b>	Yes I did binge spend, remember, that was the first question you asked.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you were manic then—
<b>PT:</b>	I—
<b>DR:</b>	That usually doesn't get you, I mean you can't use that as an excuse.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Legally.
<b>PT:</b>	But that's how and now I don't go near stores.  I don't go near stores.  I don't even want to go to the grocery store.  Can you explain to me?
<b>DR:</b>	I don't think they can do anything.
<b>PT:</b>	What are they going to do to me doc?
<b>DR:</b>	I'm surprised they haven't come and said something though.
<b>PT:</b>	I take those letters and I through them in the garbage doctor.  I know it's not right but there's nothing I can do about it and when I look at it, it makes me sicker so I throw them away, I don't care.
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	I know I'm denying and trying to turn away but there's nothing I can do.  He goes to me, why don't you get a job to help your family.
<b>DR:</b>	Well then they would down your salary.
<b>PT:</b>	Duh, I said get a job to help my family, I said, thanks a lot big spender.  Your whole $500 went real far, real far.  My dad still doesn't have a headstone.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that might be hard to do with this situation.
<b>PT:</b>	No, we got it.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh you got it.
<b>PT:</b>	My mom sold some farmland in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh really.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, got pennies on what it was worth but she needed it.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm scared, I'm scared what's going to happen.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, do you have a lawyer here?
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, I had some, he was a lawyer but he was a lunatic so no, he was dirty too.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you might need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney, I don't know, I never heard of this situation exactly so—
<b>PT:</b>	He told me that they can't do anything to me and he could lessen the debt to like 5 cents on every dollar, something like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	This is it, accept it or you're going to lose everything, she has no whatever.  Who supports me, the devil?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, if you were going to get out of the marriage, which may not be the thing to do but—
<b>PT:</b>	Right now, right.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you would, I think you would need to get rid of that debt first.
<b>PT:</b>	How, thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Clean that up so afterwards they can't come after me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  It's no rush but—
<b>PT:</b>	You have 7 years, even after 7 years, you're wiped out, they wipe it out after 7 years.
<b>DR:</b>	No, I don't—
<b>PT:</b>	This country is going to pot.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't think it exactly works like that.  That's like people think if you live together for 7 years, you're automatically like you're married, that's not true.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, uh, what they call it, yes, common law.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, just be realistic about him, I mean—
<b>PT:</b>	I am.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] nicely and well, if you're realistic, you won't get so mad, I mean or get your feelings hurt because you shouldn't expect anything.
<b>PT:</b>	He wanted to come down here for Columbus Day, I guess he was going to surprise us.  He goes now that you charged the bills on the credit card, I can't come down there.  I said you were planning to come down here, what for, what do you want to come down here for, I says to see your son I can understand but what do you want to come down here for—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Check your properties.  The grass in the backyard is this big now.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh gee.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	How we doing on the meds, they all right?
<b>PT:</b>	Have them come up with something that makes you super happy and you never come down, could you write them a letter.  Oh, doing good, actually getting tired of taking them every day.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, yeah, all right, you've got Abilify at—
<b>PT:</b>	Five mg, you've given me 5, 5, that was the old one, you told me to take the 5.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Fifteen was way, 1 at bedtime.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, all right.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, on the, are you ready, the Wellbutrin we're good, uh, 4 refills before.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh good.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, you can give me some refills for the diarrhea, that's gotten better by the way.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b>	That's gotten better and I don't take them—
<b>DR:</b>	No, unless you need them.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  Xanax I just filled, I'm fine and I have no refills.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Prevacid 2 refills.  Oh and the ADD stuff which hasn't, I don't know, did you send one out on Friday or—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we did.
<b>PT:</b>	We didn't get it yet.
<b>DR:</b>	Dated today, it's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, so it should be, should I rip it up if it's at home, you want to write me another one or—
<b>DR:</b>	Well that's the safest, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah and don't worry, I'll rip the other one up, I won't keep both.
<b>DR:</b>	That's Vyvanse, number 70
<b>PT:</b>	Seventy, is there more, that's highest it goes?
<b>DR:</b>	That's the highest, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Jesus, I see the difference because it's been, I don't know, since I had my appointment, when I cancelled and it does, I'm like in a fog.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean you get a lot more done when you're—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	When you're doing that.
<b>PT:</b>	With [NAME OTHER], we're getting along good, really good.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	I love you mom, a hug out of nowhere, I don't know where that's coming from but it feels good.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	Plenty of kisses from [NAME OTHER].  Doc, I feel alone.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you're kind of, well you're not, I'm mean—
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You've got your mother and sister.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah but here's the question, how many years have you been alone?
<b>PT:</b>	All my life.
<b>DR:</b>	Well maybe, maybe but I'd say at least 5, 6, 7.  When did you move down here?
<b>PT:</b>	Charlie, Hurricane Charlie, what, this [DATE] was 4 years.
<b>DR:</b>	Four years since Charlie.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it was welcome to Florida.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I guess that was a sign.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, when one comes down and the other one doesn't, that's usually a sign that things aren't going to well.
<b>PT:</b>	But that's what we did before to do, to go to [DEIDENTIFIED].  We were going to go back to [DEIDENTIFIED], we were going to stay in New York 2 years for him to make money and then the mother got involved and then I never got to go back.  I would go visit—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But then he says, okay, go back, move back, he bought a little store, I'm going to end it with my brothers, the store when bankrupt, forget it—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Then mama tightened the strings again, what the hell they're made of I don't know, I only wish I knew what it's made of.  I'm angry, I'm angry, I'm angry, I'm angry still, I'm angry, what am I angry at.
<b>DR:</b>	Him, the situation, right, somewhat yourself.  It's a real good thing to admit that.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm so angry and you know what, I'm not so brave like I put out to be, I hurt, I hurt all the time and I'm tired of it and I don't want people to feel sorry for me and I want to feel good, I just can't.
<b>DR:</b>	Well you're going to—
<b>PT:</b>	Get up.
<b>DR:</b>	You're going to have to get out of this situation.
<b>PT:</b>	The diarrhea pills, did you write those?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I thought I did.
<b>PT:</b>	There's this, oh, maybe they're together, no.
<b>DR:</b>	I know I wrote it.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh doc.  Did you put it over there?
<b>DR:</b>	No, I'll write it again but you're going to find it somewhere because I know it wrote it.
<b>PT:</b>	I won't OD on these, I promise.  I won't OD on anything, I've OD'd on life, I've had enough.  Freaking weather doesn't help either and you know right when the light goes away and that dusk comes, evening, I always get sad.  Would I leave this for you?
<b>DR:</b>	No, I don't need it yet.  All right, go back to your fight and the horse.
<b>PT:</b>	Thank you.  I will.  You always got to find your way through, you know what I mean?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You could leave me but I'd rather, I'd rather do it.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you've got to start developing a nice plan.
<b>PT:</b>	That's what I'm trying to do.
<b>DR:</b>	A little business plan.
<b>PT:</b>	That's what I'm trying to do doc.
