Transcript:
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], how are you doing today?
<b>PT:</b> Not good.
<b>DR:</b> What's the matter?
<b>PT:</b> Just, um, just real down.
<b>DR:</b> Did anything happen to get you upset?
<b>PT:</b> Um, yes sir, I had a, a death in the family, and a relationship that ended, you know.
<b>DR:</b> What's the circumstances?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well, it, my uncle passed away, but that, I mean, that's got me sad, but, just really, the relationship.  I mean, I had just gotten really much better, and, of course, I hadn't been in here in a while so you know I haven't been taking any medicine, and, but, um, for the past eight days I've cried, been in the bed, um, I have been going to work except for today I didn't.  I just, you know, it's bad and I just crying all night and I just couldn't, I'd get to work and just don't want to see anybody or get out of the house and just having this terrible feelings and, like, like, um, um, I have to be able to take care of my family and my house.  And I'm starting to feel like I'm going to lose control if I don't get it together.
<b>DR:</b> It's always been hard for you to accept taking treatment, hasn't it?  Not know what you want to do, although sometimes they help and sometimes they don't.  There have been some that just haven't helped you as much as we'd like.
<b>PT:</b> I think the Zoloft is what I want to get back on.
<b>DR:</b> You feel like getting back on that would be reasonable because the other couple didn't help too much.  Did, did we ever add two together?  Did we ever take, like, like, one antidepressant and then a second one?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Didn't do that?  Because sometimes when you have what's called treatment resistant depression that re, resists what we typically would do.  We will add two together, and then there's other options to do that too.  There's, sometimes we add a thyroid supplement to it even if you don't have a thyroid problem, sometimes taking an extra thyroid medicine helps boost things.  Sometimes we'll add lithium.  And you might say, "Well, why would you give me lithium?  I don't have manic depression."  Lithium, I, I use lithium three quarters of the time more often for depression than I do for manic depression, uh, because it's fast, it, it easily is added to Zoloft and, and could boost the effect.  And, of course, the newest treatment that we have, treatment resistant depression, is to take which ever antidepressant we decide is the best one and then add Abilify to it.  The, there's pluses and minuses to that because Abilify's a pretty potent medicine, um, I generally like to make sure that some of the other things haven't, haven't helped first, like, adding, you know, a second antidepressant or thyroid medicine or lithium, before I do that.  But, but you do, I mean, you have treatment resistant depression and, and, and I wish it didn't come back, but, and I know you don't want it to, but if you don't take treatment, yours is recurrent.  I mean, you, you have the kind that it's over and over and, and I know you don't want that, but we have tried to do without and it's just, it's just the wrong thing to do.  Did your anxiety come back this time or not?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, some.
<b>DR:</b> Some.  Did the Xanax help when you used it?
<b>PT:</b> Yes sir.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  You've never had a substance abuse issue?  Never been —
<b>PT:</b> No, no.
<b>DR:</b> Alcoholic and, now, this person that broke up, did they break up with you or did you break up with them?
<b>PT:</b> Um, they did.
<b>DR:</b> Were they, were they married?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So, they —
<b>PT:</b> Just, um, not in the same area.  He was just down here working for several months and —
<b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.
<b>PT:</b> He said that he was going to come back down here, but, I don't think is happening.
<b>DR:</b> Did, did you get the feeling that that wor, might work out to be more than just the dating —
<b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.
<b>DR:</b> Relationship.  You thought that's what was going to happen?  Had the person been married before?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Did he, did he have children?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum, two.
<b>DR:</b> How did you get along with the children?
<b>PT:</b> Um, fine, I only got to meet them once, but, um, that's the big thing right now, is that he just doesn't, um, see moving out of their area.  I mean, I understand that, but —
<b>DR:</b> It, it was a custody issue then, in visitation?
<b>PT:</b> No, just —
<b>DR:</b> So he didn't really did he explain why he didn't want to continue the relationship?
<b>PT:</b> Um, he just said he didn't want to, because whenever he is not working and he's back home he sees them all the time, you know, his kids, but if he were down here with me, then he would only be seeing them, like, you know, every other weekend or however it's set up.
<b>DR:</b> How long had that been since he had the breakup of that relationship?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not long, only about six months.
<b>DR:</b> Pretty recent.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> So, he's still in that, figuring out what to do.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Did you get the feeling he wants to reconcile with his ex—wife or —
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't think he's over it and I, I mean, the thing is I tried to, because I've been through that and I've been out of it for a long time, and I tried to tell him, you know, these, I want you to make sure that this is what you really want to do with me because if you don't, I can't handle it, you know, but —
<b>DR:</b> But he still —
<b>PT:</b> He just —
<b>DR:</b> Led you to believe —
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] that it, he loved me.
<b>DR:</b> Led you to believe that it would be he was in that place in his life where it could work out, yeah.  It's hard to go through courtship.  I don't have to tell you that, uh, there's a lot of heart break to that and especially if you're emotionally vulnerable in the first place.  Do you feel like any form of counseling would help you?
<b>PT:</b> I didn't mind it.  I'm just not the whole into the talker.  I'm not real —
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] [NAME OTHER].  Um, what about pastoral, I mean, would, would talking to a pastor help you or, or not?
<b>PT:</b> Well, right now, I haven't been regular.  I mean, I used to be, um, real regular in church but I guess for the past two years I haven't been at all.  It, kind of, depresses me to go there because I see all these happy little families and just depresses me.  Just, it's loneliness [CRYING] and, you know, the, the need for companionship is big thing with me.  And so since I was in this relationship, it took care of that and now it's back to the same and just, I don't know why I can't just deal with it, but it just overwhelms me.
<b>DR:</b> Do you get down on yourself?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  And, like I said, I just, I don't want to interact socially.  I don't want to go visit any friends.  My best friend came over, and, um, you know, just practically made me get up out of bed and go with her but, um, excuse me, when my kids are there I have to be up, you know, taking care of things, but they've been gone since Friday.  It's just been me there, so I went to work and went back to bed and stayed there until the next morning.
<b>DR:</b> Have you had thoughts about hurting yourself?
<b>PT:</b> No, not hurting myself, but just that I will lose control, that I will be so debilitated from this, that I won't be able to take care of things, you know, my household.
<b>DR:</b> That, that's a frightening thought, but that had never happened.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And even though you're a condition only partially responds, it always responds some way.  But the treatment resistance part is, is what we want to try this time, maybe, to be extra careful about picking something that you can continue and, maybe, persuade you that you don't need to be getting off of your medicine.  Because, you're, I mean, you get in this state, hon, and you don't do any good whenever you're this depressed.
<b>PT:</b> I know.  I missed work today.
<b>DR:</b> They're pretty understanding over there?
<b>PT:</b> Yes sir, they just don't ask me any questions.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well they, you don't, they don't need to know your business.  You don't need to tell them what's going on with that.  But you're able to keep up, prior to this you're able to do your work and have satisfactory performance?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> And that sort of stuff?  Well, let, let's go over the choices.  I want you to be able to understand that and decide with me, because you can't really make a wrong choice, um, I'm going to send you home with the material to read about the Abilify because even if we don't use that one, I'd like you to have it and look into that.  Um, Zoloft, as you know, is a serotonin agent.  It works on the chemical, serotonin.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And that's the ones that you've tried before, the Effexor, and the Paxil, you know.  The Effexor has both noradrenaline and serotonin it works on.  Zoloft works purely on serotonin.  But sometimes we can add a medicine, like, here towards the bottom, bupropion.  It has —
<b>PT:</b> Yes sir.
<b>DR:</b> Effect on the, not only the, uh, serotonin, but the bupropion works on dopamine and noradrenaline.  Uh, there is a new antidepressant called Pristiq that is a byproduct of Effexor, uh, the chemical that make up [INAUDIBLE] Effexor called venlafaxine.  They've refined it and use a metabolic byproduct called desvenlafaxine, desmethylvenlafaxine and it, it's a pretty well tolerated medicine.  It's, kind of pricey as those things go.  It doesn't have a generic, so, um, some ways the sertraline, since you know, at least, you tolerate that and we could add a bupropion to it.  It's a generic.  It doesn't cost very much.  It also is not cost very much to add thyroid medicine because they're pretty reasonable cost and it doesn't cost very much to add, lithium if we decide to use that.  Lithium is salt.  It's handled by your body salt, so you drink plenty of fluids and it's flushed out of your body.  I like that it, it's pretty much win fast, lose fast, with that one, um, and it combines very safely with Zoloft and, and Xanax too, for that manner.  Um, the one downside is you do have to monitor it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You have to do blood tests periodically to check your thyroid and check your kidneys and make sure they're okay.  Uh, but  it, it, it, I'm not going to use it like I would for a manic depressive, so it wouldn't have to be managed at the highest level, so most people can't even feel it.  It just gives you the benefit or it doesn't.  Um, the quickest thing probably would be, get back on the Zoloft and let me add something else to it, as opposed to starting a whole new medicine because we at least knew we got some good out of Zoloft.  You had to stop it because it seemed to quit working for you.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> But maybe to manage that we could add a second thing and we just decide together what that is today.
<b>PT:</b> I'm fine as long as there is no side effect, you know, major side effects.
<b>DR:</b> I definitely think the lithium choice is a good one for you because you are young and healthy and, uh, and it's easy to tell in a very short time what the dose of lithium needs to be, um, lithium is just a blood test so all you have to do is, your regular doctor could do the test.  And, uh, we'd just have Zoloft and lithium together and then give you a prescription for the Xanax.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> What about your family?  Have they said —
<b>PT:</b> Well, they, of course, worry about, and, you know, my mom, of course wanted me to come back into the doctor —
<b>DR:</b> Did she approve of this man?
<b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.
<b>DR:</b> She thought he was, he was a decent person and uh, so it wasn't like that was a bad situation?
<b>PT:</b> Hum—um.  I mean, he, it was just the, the best relationship I've ever had as far as somebody treating me, I've never been treated so sweet and so respectful and I didn't have to do a thing, I mean, he took care of me, you know, like, just, little things and just —
<b>DR:</b> But there's a part of you that believes that might still work out?
<b>PT:</b> Um, uh, I just don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Not to be, maybe —
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, he just, it's hurting me so bad right now, I don't know if I could, you know, ever go back and feel the same way.  I just, he treated me, like, just a little doll.  I didn't have to, it was just something different than I ever experienced.
<b>DR:</b> I think you do have to be aware that, I hate to say it, but the men that know wh, what makes them unsuitable, hide what makes them unsuitable.  Whether it's that they, they treat you bad or they're a philanderer or they won't work or they're an alcoholic or whatever it is and, and that's not unusual.  But they'll, they'll make you believe, "Oh yes, I'm the mer, I'm the perfect gentleman."  And then quick as things get to where you really have to go one way or the other and they show you their true self.  What about your panic attacks?  Have they resumed or are you holding up okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That came back —
<b>PT:</b> Not often, um, I don't know, a couple every so many weeks.
<b>DR:</b> But you never see things or hear things?  Hear voices, see things?
<b>PT:</b> Hum—um.
<b>DR:</b> Never believe someone's trying to hurt or kill you?
<b>PT:</b> Hum—um.
<b>DR:</b> Never have any racing thoughts where you're speeded up, you feel like you're the greatest person on earth?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Don't sleep for days, anything like that?
<b>PT:</b> No.  It seems like I've just gotten to be this, like, real downer and I used to not be that way.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I know in the beginning, I mean, you were, let's say you were less than enthusiastic about being a patient, and, and didn't really want to buy into any of this stuff.  And I think as time has gone along, it's not just been your mother that persuaded you.  I think it was the fact that this won't get better and stay better without you doing something.  It has made it easier this time to not wait until it's absolutely the worst, because it's certainly capable of being way worse than this.  And as bad as you're feeling right now, we don't need to wait for that to happen again.  So I would propose that you let me give you this medicine.  Let me re—evaluate things in not too long.  I mean, you could go for two to four weeks if you wanted to, but I wish you would do the test in about a week or so.  Um, and you have the lithium three times a day and then the next day before you do the, the blood test, don't have the lith, uh, don't have the lithium, because the only thing I'm going to check is the lithium.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't matter if you eat or drink anything.  You can take your other medicine, but just don't take the lithium that morning, and then have the tests made sometime before noon and that gets —
<b>PT:</b> Can I ask you this?
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> [COUGHING] Excuse me.  I have [INAUDIBLE] nurse, you know, and I have a lot of best friends —
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> If you gave me just an outpatient lab slip, could I have one of them draw it because they do drawing all the time —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> In home health?
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> I can just take it to [DEIDENTIFIED] —
<b>DR:</b> Anybody, anybody can do it.  [DEIDENTIFIED] could do it that [DEIDENTIFIED].  Just call them and ask them.  You know, ask them about what their, their policy is on that, but there's no, there's no medical reason why that can't be.  I mean —
<b>PT:</b> I mean, it would just keep me from making a doctor's appointment with the doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, you know, ask them over there at [DEIDENTIFIED] too.  I don't know, have you, have you had any lab recently?
<b>PT:</b> No sir.
<b>DR:</b> You didn't figure out the policies, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Now, would they, because I used to do it to, is where the doctor was associated we would either drop them at the [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED] —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Or [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> It, it really doesn't make a difference because all of them acknowledge this test.  It's a very simple test.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Salt is easy to measure.  Now, it may be a send out.  I don't think they'll have it the same day, but I'll send you a report about what it shows.  My inclination is to say, we ought to probably give it a couple of, you know, week or 10 days.  You, you'll know by then.  Just drink plenty of fluids and be careful to take it with, uh food on your stomach.  If you get upset stomach, carry a couple of Pepto—Bismol tablets with you.  If you're at home take a couple of tablespoons of Pepto—Bismol.  It should set, settle your stomach.  Because the main problem you get with this is a little bit of loose bowels or upset stomach in the beginning.  Your hand may tremble a little, but that goes away in most people, because we're going to keep it on the low side.  We don't need to use a higher dose as we do for a manic depression.  But I, I really do believe that we can get Zoloft to help you again, because it helped you before.  It's just what I remember of it was, it, kind of, pooped out and you still had some left over symptoms to the treatment resistance so we need to add something to it, so I'll let you go home and read about the Abilify.  Uh, we're not going to use the bupropion, but that, that's also called Wellbutrin, so —
<b>PT:</b> Um.
<b>DR:</b> If you just wanted to look it up, that's what to look up.  But, uh, I think this is a good choice of things and we should be able to see something within two to four weeks, you should start to feel it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Well, what questions do you have about this treatment?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't have any questions [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Have, have you weighed yourself recently?
<b>PT:</b> Yes sir, I've lost about 10 pounds.
<b>DR:</b> How much, how much, because last time I remember you weighed about 130?
<b>PT:</b> I've been weighing about 134 for the past two years, but I weigh 124 right now.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, we're, we're going to be watchful of that because, as you know, that's a sign of depression.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's not a good kind of weight loss.  That's not the kind we want you to have.  I want you to have the healthy kind, so, uh let's do that, let's go ahead with, uh, your height is 5'4"?
<b>PT:</b> I'm just five foot.
<b>DR:</b> Five three?
<b>PT:</b> Five foot.
<b>DR:</b> Five foot even, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Let's, let's do this.  Let's go ahead leave the Zoloft the same, uh, Xanax, you know how to use that.  I gave you enough to, to adjust that.  And then call me sooner if it's not going right, we will get together and decide.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  Get this off —
