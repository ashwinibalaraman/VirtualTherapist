BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Thank you very much.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	How have you been doing lately?
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  Good.  I know we spoke last week and it sounds as though, you know, medication adjustment—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Was helpful.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I wasn't feeling well at work.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, what had been going on?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, just a little depressed, irritated.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Any new sources of stress or changes?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	The last time we got together, had we talked about is your grandmother been ill?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's been ill for about a year.
<b>DR:</b>	How's she been doing lately?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, not good.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Do you see, um, sort of a gradual progression of her illness?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, she has dementia, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	She doesn't really remember much.
<b>DR:</b>	That's hard.
<b>PT:</b>	My Mom's always taking care of her.
<b>DR:</b>	Do they live together?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my grandma lives with them.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So it sounds like you see her pretty often.
<b>PT:</b>	Once in a while.  I try, I try.  They live over in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and how's work been?  I know there was some staffing questions.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, it's just busy.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I feel like I'm always there.
<b>DR:</b>	You put in very long hours at that job as I recall.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Last week, was it especially stressful in terms of the work demand or?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I think the boss's wife's been a little annoying and telling me what to do, and I work with a friend of mine and he was really irritating me.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my gosh.
<b>PT:</b>	So I went to lunch with, I went to the park and cried and then I called—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	To work?  How were they about that?
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] fine with that.  She understands.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  I think sometimes people need to, you know, just have the inside, just to let you know, today got off to a bad start—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It doesn't look like it's going to get better, and you've worked hard.  You have benefits and part of the reason there is sick time and personal time is so that you can take that break and do that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And they trust you to know when you need to do it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they, they understand.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  With your friend, have things improved?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.  He was just constantly complaining.
<b>DR:</b>	Really?  Yeah.  What kinds of things was he complaining about?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, the amount of work he does.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	What a hard worker he is.  No one understands.  He tells me I have to get off my medication.
<b>DR:</b>	Now where is he coming from having opinions about that?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  How did that topic of conversation get started?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I'm not even sure.  It's just always there sometimes.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Have you confided in him that you were taking medication at one point?
<b>PT:</b>	Well he knows I've been on medication.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I switched medication and he just thinks I'm on—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Medication for too long, I guess.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh, and why would he think that?  I mean has he said anything about—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I think he's a little crazy.
<b>DR:</b>	It's really strange.  Sometimes the people with the strongest opinions or would protest the most—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, might actually be able to benefit.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It's really ironic.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's hard sometimes.  Um, I have some patients who are in recovery from alcohol or drug use and certain meetings are opposed to any kind of medication, anything.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, and so, um, sometimes people feel they can't share everything because they'll be judged for doing what they need to do, and whereas a meeting like that, usually they wouldn't sit in judgment on a diabetic person who needs insulin or someone who has pneumonia taking an antibiotic.  Um, on the other hand, there are meetings that are knowledgeable about mental health and, you know, with those kinds of issues and it's just so hard when other people having these opinions and it isn't as if their life is perfect, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Or they found some magic, you know, chant or religion or whatever.  You know, one size does not fit all.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	And the main thing is, you know, if, um, if something's going on, uh, taking charge, addressing it, you know, just like you did, picking up the phone and say hey, gosh, I can tell from the way I'm feeling and reacting, things are really starting to get to me, and chances are good he's just as cranky.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, but, uh, you know, you have a right to keep your privacy, and you know, a certain wall of protection, but it sounds as though there's still [INAUDIBLE].  Here's a tissue.  Is there more that's been happening with that?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, what's been going on?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I just feel very alone.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you been able to talk to your husband about what's going on?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Has he, has he picked up on anything?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  What kinds of things do you feel like you could use more support?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  It's just sometimes I just feel like leaving and—
<b>DR:</b>	Leaving your husband?
<b>PT:</b>	Just everything.
<b>DR:</b>	And work?  Yeah, what would you like to have in your life that's not there now?
<b>PT:</b>	I'd like to be happy which I'm not.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How long have you been feeling like you're not happy?
<b>PT:</b>	A while.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  When did it start?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  A long time.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm just unhappy in general.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Do you have a sense of what's missing?  It sounds like someone that you could talk to who would understand how you're feeling, if that would make a difference.  What happens when you try to talk to your husband?
<b>PT:</b>	I talk to him sometimes, but not really about this stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um, if you do talk to him, or try to talk to him about, um, you know, how you're feeling or mental health concerns, how does he usually react?
<b>PT:</b>	He tries to listen.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You say he tries to listen.  Is there a sign that maybe he's either not able to listen or—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, he listens.  He's just, sometimes I feel like he doesn't understand or—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  What kinds of things does he say that, that you think maybe it's not getting through or he's not understanding?
<b>PT:</b>	He leaves me alone a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Is his job really busy?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	So—
<b>PT:</b>	He tries to be supportive.  He tries [INAUDIBLE] with me, but I just, I don't know.  I just feel like there's something missing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Where is he when he's leaving you alone?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I would say downstairs.  I mean I'll just lay in bed and sleep.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I sleep a lot now.
<b>DR:</b>	So you've been sleeping more than usual?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	How many hours a day?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, if I have off, I mean I'll probably sleep all day.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, are you able to sleep at night also?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I sleep at night too.
<b>DR:</b>	Often sleeping a lot, sleeping too much can be a sign of worsening depression also.  Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, no.  No, I've been okay with that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Do you have a sense of what's missing?  Um, I know there was a time you and your husband were talking about having a family.  What are your thoughts with that?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, we're not ready.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um, do you feel like you might not be ready because you might like to be more established in your career or do you have doubts whether he's the person to have a family with?
<b>PT:</b>	I think just, um, with myself.  I want to be happy with myself before I have kids.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Before, you know, what's been happening over the past while and it sounds like you haven't been happy in a while.  When is the last time that you remember feeling happy?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, we went away last weekend.  We had a good time.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  What did you guys do?
<b>PT:</b>	Went to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's nice.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  We went up with my parents, so it was nice to see them and we went to dinner.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's great.  And somebody was watching your grandmother?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, so everybody got a change of scene, that's such a good idea.  So it sounds as though under the right circumstances, you and your husband can have fun together.  You know, you reconnect with your parents.
<b>PT:</b>	I just feel bored a lot like.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm bored with things.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you're a very bright person, and I'm wondering if on your job, do you feel like you've met most of the challenges it has or is there something standing in your way if you're being able to?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I think I met all the challenges that I could there.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Uh, have you been thinking about something you might like to do instead?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I was trying to finish off school and I have maybe 12 credits to go, but I don't know what's after that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And then [INAUDIBLE] and, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	What degree will be getting?
<b>PT:</b>	A Bachelor's in liberal studies.
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	Which I don't know what I'm going to do with that.
<b>DR:</b>	But it's a great degree to have because it applies to everything.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean your communication skills will be better, your fountain of knowledge, your ability to do research.
<b>PT:</b>	And I feel like when I'm in school, I don't get as bored and that—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I kind of like to learn and I've been out of school, so maybe it's just the boredom of not knowing what to do with myself.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I used to do crafts and jewelry and I don't do anything now.
<b>DR:</b>	It sounds like you're using some of the time you might have put toward that sleeping.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And there was a time when you slept that you had nightmares and, and would, uh, be very restless even when you were asleep.  Is that still happening?
<b>PT:</b>	The nightmares once in a while.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And, um, the Lexapro just went up, you know, about 10 days ago or so I think.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you felt any difference yet from that?
<b>PT:</b>	It's a little better than that one day.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Sometimes it can take a few weeks even before we know all that the increase in the dose can do.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, it's a very, very good sign that you were able to have a good time last weekend.  Do you think in your future there are more opportunities, even for you and your husband to do things like that, to be able to get a change of scene—
<b>PT:</b>	Probably.  It's kind of hard with the dog and—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Work and.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Are there places your dog can travel with you even for a day trip?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Not really?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I can't bring him.  He barks too much.
<b>DR:</b>	Really.  Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I could bring him to work anytime I go, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Not for a while [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, yeah.  How old is your dog?
<b>PT:</b>	He's two.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And, um, how's his behavior been?  It sounds like he barks.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he barks.
<b>DR:</b>	Does he bark a lot at home?
<b>PT:</b>	A little bit.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	When you're out for walks or, you know, just the usual daily routine, is he pretty good—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	At staying in a routine?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he's pretty good.
<b>DR:</b>	But it sounds like when you travel, you're worried about him barking a lot?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's tough.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, we'd bring him camping, but he would bark at everybody [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I wonder why he barks so much.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  He's a hound.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow, because that's the way animals communicate.  People don't always understand, but you know.  If, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Because it is fun when you can travel with the pet and there are some places that are pet friendly.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Now my cat got sick.  She was urinating all over the place, so I had to bring her to the hospital.  I was going to put them down, but they put her on BuSpar.
<b>DR:</b>	No kidding.  I've heard of that working well for cats.
<b>PT:</b>	And it's been working great, so.
<b>DR:</b>	That's excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	It's been like two months or a month.
<b>DR:</b>	Because that was a stress.  When you thought you might have to put her down, that must have been—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Really.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe some of it is catching up with you now.  You know, a lot's been going on.  How old is she now?
<b>PT:</b>	She's like [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so she's older.  Yeah, cats and bladder control can get tougher obviously as they get older.  You probably even know that even better than I do.  Um, that's wonderful that there's something that helps.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah, she's doing good.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I get a real sense of sadness.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What's missing that you might be able to put back in and put back in?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Will you start back with classes in September?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, yes.
<b>DR:</b>	What will you be taking?
<b>PT:</b>	I think a History and Spanish.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, fun.  Have you studied Spanish before?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I took 2 years.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's so great.  That is a fantastic skill to have.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I think that's, you know, in this country, the most important second language, there are so many things you could do with that.  Um, even if you wanted a job as a translator at a hospital—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, lots of different avenues.  Um, have you thought about teaching ultimately?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I can't do teaching.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not good in public, public speaking.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it might be hard to, to get out in front of people?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, or tutoring.  You know, more of a one on one kind of a situation.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Another nice thing about getting a liberal arts degree is that you get to explore different things and then, you know, try to get a feel what you might like to go on and do.  Um—
<b>PT:</b>	I took Sociology.  I enjoyed that.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's great.
<b>PT:</b>	That class was fun.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	And sometimes businesses, you know, hire people to study organizational behavior or, um, that kind of thing.  So there could be some avenues there as well.  What does your husband do for a living?
<b>PT:</b>	He makes copiers
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Yeah, is he at Kinko's or someplace like that?
<b>PT:</b>	Someplace in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That can be fun because there could be creativity, you know, getting something going up or, you know, getting the right color and that kind of thing.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Does, you know, he have a restlessness like you'd like to do more or does he seem like he's set with—
<b>PT:</b>	No, I think he's set.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And this being [AGE], I feel like I'm getting older.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Thirty is the new twenty.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, it is hard though.  Yeah, when, when you were younger and you thought about being [AGE], did you have an idea of certain things that would be in your life or what your life would be like?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I didn't think I wanted to be [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, no kidding.  It's funny, um—
<b>PT:</b>	That was old.
<b>DR:</b>	It's definitely not middle age.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean because we wouldn't call 60 elderly, you know, but, uh, you're younger than I am, but I remember, uh, there was a slogan in the 60s, don't trust anybody over 30.  It's ridiculous.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, but I think nowadays, you know, in terms of going into certain fields and needing to do schooling for, uh, possibly a longer period of time, it feels like, you know, getting into our parent's routine, you know, the age at which they started families, had children, committed to a career, it seems very foreign now because it's like well I'm still figuring out, you know, what I want to do and nothing's put together.  You know, it's not like how being [AGE] was in the 1920s.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, but yeah those milestone birthdays can be a, a little bit of a hurdle.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, did you get to celebrate or anything?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it was last November.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It was a while ago.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but sometimes, you know, as the year goes on, you think oh, my [AGE] year is winding down and—
<b>PT:</b>	And I feel like I'm obligated to have kids now, and I don't want to.
<b>DR:</b>	Who wants to?  Who wants you to?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I think it's just expected.  My parents expect it.  My sister, because everyone else has kids.
<b>DR:</b>	It's hard because, um, I have several good friends who have chosen to remain childless and it's just amazing how many people have opinions about that, who really it's none of anybody's business except you and your husband.  Those are the only two people who matter.
<b>PT:</b>	And it's expensive.  We don't have the, you know, we live week to week.  We can't.  Where we going to get the money to have a kid.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Does your husband feel like he wants to have children as soon as possible?
<b>PT:</b>	Well he's, no, no.
<b>DR:</b>	In a way, it's a good thing that you two might feel similarly about it because if one person is pushing and the other one is, is really ambivalent because that's a very, very personal decision.
<b>PT:</b>	And we got our animals, and you know, they're expensive, and I don't want to take away from them.  You know, I'll have to get rid of them if I had a baby.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  Right, and, um, you have a job in which you give TLC and loving care and, um, a lot of people feel that their pets, they absolutely are family members, for many people, it's like children.  Um, and you have a right to do whatever you want to do, you know, and, um, are your parents saying anything about that?
<b>PT:</b>	Not right now, no.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, and they have grandchildren, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they have like 9.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	They have plenty.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, do your husband's parents have grandchildren also?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, it's just his Mom.  She was [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	So they have plenty of grandchildren to keep them busy.  You have time also.  Thirty is not, you know, in the thirties, even forties, a lot of people have children at those ages if they feel that they're ready, um, but also you have a right not to.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know.  I have 2 sons, and I love them dearly.  Wouldn't trade it for anything.  At the same time, I can totally understand why choose to have none or one, um, because it is a very major change in your life, and, um, priorities, finances, and I wouldn't dream of saying to somebody else you should do what I did, you know.  I can totally understand either way.  And there are such biases against people who have, choose not to have any children or those who choose to have one.  You know, oh, it's so unfair, you know.  How can you bring this person into your life without siblings?  It's none of your business.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, to have a caring, to have one other caring person in a person's life.  If we could guarantee that for every baby that's born, we would be way ahead of the game.  So in terms of what someone deserves or should do, nobody's opinion matters at all except yours and your husbands.  It's, uh, yeah, if you're not ready, you know, don't, don't feel it's something you have to do.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, there may be a time in your life when you do feel ready, but if not, you have a full life, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, you're learning new things.  Uh, you're, uh, making the world a better place with the work that you do.  Um, you're giving love to, uh, creatures who, you know, really do depend on people.  Um, many people might [INAUDIBLE] or put it down, you know, rather than leave it up.  I'm going to buy medications or I'm not going to bother with that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and people do.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you've seen that.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	When they go on vacation and put them in the kennel for 3 months.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Which isn't nice.
<b>DR:</b>	That's a long time.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Hopefully the animals can enjoy where they are and feel like it's camp, but I think animals are so loyal, you know, that they, even after someone they love dies, they're always missing them.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So in that 3 months.  Then again, if I were in that animal's fur so to speak, I'd be glad that someone like you might be there to understand.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, how it is to be missing people who were away.  So, how, have people been asking you nosy questions or intrusive questions about, um, starting a family?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, some, here and there.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um, how do you respond when they do, like what kinds of things were they saying?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, when are you going to have kids or that kind of stuff.  I just say I'm not ready.  I don't even know if we're going to have them.
<b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.  Yeah, or you can even say, you know, it's a personal decision between my husband and me, you know, we may or may not.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah because my cousin's pregnant again and [INAUDIBLE] are talking about that.  How cute, all the girls are together and, and I don't go to family functions [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	I go to them when I can.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	My sister is mad at me because I didn't go to her son's first birthday party and [INAUDIBLE] the whole year.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow, they're hard on you.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, um, why, why didn't you go?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, [NAME OTHER] birthday.  I think we had, I think we had prior, I had prior plans to—
<b>DR:</b>	That's understandable.
<b>PT:</b>	Bridal shower of my sister.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness, that's a busy day.
<b>PT:</b>	And they don't understand.  I don't really talk to them that much.
<b>DR:</b>	I definitely don't expect everyone in my family to come to the kids' birthdays.  If they can, great, but if they have something else going on, I totally understand.  I mean they have lives too.  With the number of nieces and nephews it sounds like you have, you could have a full time job just attending their functions.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And you shouldn't have to.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I shouldn't have to.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, if you'd like to be with them and they know that you're there, that's all that matters.  You know, even if you only get to see them once every few years even.  Yeah, it's hard.  It sounds like, you know, at least one of your sisters kind of holds a grudge, huh?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because she moved over here and then she left.  She said she moved over here for me and—
<b>DR:</b>	For you, specifically for you?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Why?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I guess she wanted us to be close.  You know, she moved back to [DEIDENTIFIED] and had a baby and I never see her anymore.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	She gets upset about that.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] spending time with her?
<b>PT:</b>	You know, she yells at me a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Were you two close when you were younger?
<b>PT:</b>	A little bit, not so much.
<b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  Sounds like she has a lot of expectations.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	When she moved over here supposedly to be, to become closer to you, um, what was happening around that time?  Were you married at that time?
<b>PT:</b>	I was getting married.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	She went to [DEIDENTIFIED] with us to get married.
<b>DR:</b>	No kidding.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, her husband proposed to her the day before we got married which was a little [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, and she [INAUDIBLE].  He did that.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Is she older or younger than you?
<b>PT:</b>	She's older.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	She's very selfish, loud [INAUDIBLE].  You know, I'm kind of stuck in the middle and I'm not loud or, you know.  I'm a quiet, reserved, laid back person.
<b>DR:</b>	That's a great way to be able to do.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know.  Sometimes people who are very outspoken or loud or flamboyant, you know, they, they like to be around calming people, but they need to respect that and they need to also respect your need for quiet [INAUDIBLE] may not always be, um, you know, what you want to be doing at that time.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It kind of sounds like she's kind of all or nothing.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	How did she come about going to [DEIDENTIFIED] with you two when you got married?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, she asked my Dad if she could go.
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  She invited herself along.  I had a feeling you were going to say that.  So who else was there?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, her boyfriend and my parents.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Huh, so it was going to be you and your husband, you know, at the time your fiancee and your parents, and then she asked if she could come.  So it isn't like you invited the whole family, and she didn't ask you if she could come.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  It's your wedding.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, we had the wedding planned, but we cancelled it.
<b>DR:</b>	Ah.
<b>PT:</b>	Six months before.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, why did you cancel that?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, my brother was [INAUDIBLE] on drugs.  It was just stressful, so we just said forget it.
<b>DR:</b>	So you felt like rather than having a huge mob, you know, you'd like to just go someplace beautiful, just the basics.  Huh, you're right, your sister was thinking more about herself.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it was a nice thing that you did to share your wedding with them.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And it would be nice if she could appreciate that.  I don't know if that's in her—
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	General outlook.
<b>PT:</b>	Now, we, we think different ways and—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You can tell.
<b>PT:</b>	Like with my brother, she's all in denial and wouldn't accept it, and I know what's, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I talk about it and she would rather not discuss it.
<b>DR:</b>	How's your brother doing now?
<b>PT:</b>	He's doing okay.  He [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Has he been able to stay in recovery?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think so.
<b>DR:</b>	Great.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.
<b>PT:</b>	But his, his, uh, his ex wife ran away.  She wouldn't [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	So he's got a lot on his plate.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	How's he managing with the 4 kids?
<b>PT:</b>	As far as I know, okay.  He's only got 2 of them.  The other 2 lives at her moms.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Does he have any help working with them?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, he has his girlfriend, but she was the one in the car crash, so she's not really, I don't know how much she helps.
<b>DR:</b>	So there's been a lot going on.  How old are the kids?
<b>PT:</b>	[AGE], [AGE], and [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, well the good thing if something is off kilter, they can tell somebody about it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Is your brother's diabetes insulin dependent?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um, is he someone who is kind of a brittle diabetic, like his blood sugar can suddenly drop or—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it's been [INAUDIBLE] a couple of times.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  So yeah, he's probably gone into diabetic coma.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  So I lost a good friend to insulin shots.  He tended to go the other way, too much insulin—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Or was very, very, so concerned about having high blood sugar that it tended to run low, and, um, he went into a coma a couple of times that way.  Um, now I'm not 100% sure of the circumstances of his death because I wasn't with him at the time, but I believe it was in some way related, like maybe he also got sick and then, it's, it's very worrisome when someone's blood sugar can be that volatile.
<b>PT:</b>	Especially when they drink and have a history of drug use.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, and alcohol in particular, you know it just converts to sugar.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So.
<b>PT:</b>	He [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.  I hope he'll take care of himself because, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	I hope so too.
<b>DR:</b>	He's a father.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	He can't depend on her [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly, but as you're saying, you're supportive.  You accept that certain things exist and hopefully if he needs to talk to someone, if he's having a struggle with something, you know, he'll be able to let you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm sure he would come to me.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, hopefully he has a health care provider.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	To talk with.  Diabetes is a tough one.  I know a couple of people who have had good results with the insulin pump, uh, but of course, you have to be motivated.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You have to recognize you need it.
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	You have to be motivated to get it.  And they're coming up with better ways of monitoring blood sugar too, um, so it isn't as, you know, painful and messy and so forth.  So, oh, well I imagine every day you try to send some good thoughts his way—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I try to.
<b>DR:</b>	To just keep him holding on, and again, you know, both of your siblings, they're grown people.  They're adults.  They're responsible for their behavior.  Um, you can't live their lives for them, um, but if they're seeing the real you, they'll know, you know, they have a steadfast ally, someone they can turn to.  They also have to appreciate you for who you are, and, you know, you have enough stress in the day to day that you can't drop everything and go attend every function for your nieces and nephews.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Do your parents at least, seem to be understanding about that, you know, that, um—
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Not all the time.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It's kind of hard to talk to them though because they got grandma.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I know how hard that it is, and how frustrated she is.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, they had to get rid of my, I got my grandma a dog and they had to get rid of the dog the other day—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Because grandma wouldn't stop feeding it.  She forgot that she gave him something, and then she'd just go and kept on feeding the dog and the dog was getting sick.  So they gave it to my aunt.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, which is sad because, you know, that was her buddy.  I don't even know if she knows that he's gone.
<b>DR:</b>	Gosh, that's hard.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, it's hard.  It's hard to see her go I mean.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I mean you gave her a wonderful gift of companionship.  Is there any, you know, could a lower maintenance creature be considered like—
<b>PT:</b>	Probably not.
<b>DR:</b>	Certainly cats you can just leave food and water out.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, there's a cat there for her, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my Mom has a cat.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So that's okay.
<b>PT:</b>	She can't eat solids.  She's on an all liquid diet.
<b>DR:</b>	Your grandmother?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  She [INAUDIBLE].  It's sad.
<b>DR:</b>	Is there anybody who can give your Mom a break, like another brother or sister?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, that's, that's what she gets, like the last couple of weekends ago, she got to go away because my aunt doing one weekend a month for her.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, it's better than nothing.  It would be nice to have a little bit more equal—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but there's 3 other, you know, 3 siblings—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But she's the only one that.
<b>DR:</b>	So often that happens and it just, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	She's not going to put her in a home, you know, they don't want to do that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and then sometimes it's tough.  I've seen it happen where, um, one sibling feels strongly about the parent not going into, um, you know, assisted living or a nursing home and the other siblings think they should, so then those siblings feel like well, you know, I know what I think should be going on, and you know, this person who's the holdout, well it's on them.  Well, still, you have to think about the person and their quality of life, both people, and, you know, to be able to, you know, pick up a weekend a month or give a break for a few hours here or there.  You know, even if for some reason a sibling didn't agree with your mother's decision, nonetheless, the fact is, you know, she's doing what she feels is the right thing, and she needs support.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So, well I'm sure being able to talk to you is a relief.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But then you may feel a little bit frustrated, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, she makes me a little sad because she can't—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	She can't leave the house without someone watching her and she can't come over and see us.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It's sad, so.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you comfortable spending time with your grandmother if you go?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  It's not too painful if she doesn't recognize—
<b>PT:</b>	No, she knows who I am.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	She knows, she knows who everyone is.  She doesn't remember what she did like she smoked for 50 years.  She quit and forgot she even smoked.
<b>DR:</b>	I've never thought about that as being an unintended health benefit of dementia.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But it would make sense, you know, when you think about backward in time like a person's going back to almost infancy—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, of course, there's not going to be the inclination to smoke or even remembering how to do it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she just forgot that she ever did it.
<b>DR:</b>	God bless her.  It sounds like you are giving her the best quality of life possible.
<b>PT:</b>	I tell her I love her when I go over.
<b>DR:</b>	That's good.  Yeah, I think just simple hugs and—
<b>PT:</b>	What else can do, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly, you know, and I think just being in the same room with somebody else.  You don't always have to be talking or entertaining or whatever, but just sitting quietly, there's a lot to be said for that with someone who understands and isn't expecting, you know, major, uh, statements every few minutes.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Can your dog visit with her?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	No, he'd be too excited in the environment.  There's a cat there.  Yeah, I can picture that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I, you know, [INAUDIBLE] brings her dog down once in a while, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Just to remind her, to at least bring her around.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, at your aunt's house.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because the only reason she lived for so long is because she told me, it's because she had the dog.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Does your mother know that?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and then she took him away the other day.  I understand it's not my house.  It's not my call, but, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	How far, how far away does your aunt who has the dog live?
<b>PT:</b>	About 20 minutes.
<b>DR:</b>	Is there ever a situation where you could swing by and pick up the dog and come for a visit?
<b>PT:</b>	I probably could.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because that way you know it's getting done, and you know your grandmother's getting the benefit.  You know, I don't want to put too much on you, you know, with the long trip or whatever, but, uh, if you feel comfortable doing it, and if both you and your grandmother enjoy spending time together with the dog, you know, it kind of reinforces the message to your mother and aunt, this is something important in her life, and you know, if she's feeling down in the dumps or sad, even if she doesn't remember she had a dog, when she sees the dog, she probably recognizes it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she'd probably know his name.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, she'll probably call my Mom Freckles sometimes.
<b>DR:</b>	Ha ha, how cute.  Oh, is Freckles a cocker spaniel?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.  They are so loving too.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I got him for her when, when he was 8 weeks.
<b>DR:</b>	That's a great choice.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, for Mother's Day.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  It might be nice to, to do some, some [INAUDIBLE] with Freckles.  Yeah.  And that's plenty of nurturing, you know, right now.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean she might not be sad now, but it's only been, you know, 2 days.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, by Monday she might be a little depressed, miss her dog.  You know, that was her buddy, sat next to her every day.
<b>DR:</b>	And in terms of your nurturing someone, between your job, you know, helping your grandmother, maybe taking Freckles, nobody ought to be pressuring you about one single other thing.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know.  You being able to nurture yourself I also think is just really important.  So, you know, if your husband is receptive and you want to get away for a day trip even or, you know, go walk on the Boardwalk.  It's not that far.  You don't have to spend the night.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And come September, you know, a lot of things are still going to be open without the crowds.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, well how do you feel at this point about, you know, staying with, we've fairly recently made an adjustment on the Lexapro, you know, stay with that for a little bit and then, um, when would you like to meet again?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, when do you want?
<b>DR:</b>	Um, depending on your schedule, and you know, I don't want to add to the demands, but we could consider a month, 6 weeks, 8 weeks.
<b>PT:</b>	We can do a month, that's fine.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, that sounds good.  Now is there a time on a Tuesday that works for you because I know you've had some changes in your job schedule.
<b>PT:</b>	Well I have, they give a big break in the afternoon.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  So we could maybe look afternoon times are good.  What time in the afternoon is usually best for you?  I've got a 1:45, [DATE].
<b>PT:</b>	That's fine.
<b>DR:</b>	I could also do 11:00 and then the following week, that afternoon's open.
<b>PT:</b>	The 1:45 is fine.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, sounds good.  And would you like a card with the—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Contact info.  Sounds good.  How are you set for prescriptions?  I know I called in the Lexapro.
<b>PT:</b>	Well the thing is I'm doing 2 now, so I don't know—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, let me write for the 20—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Because actually it does in a single 20 mg tablet.  That'll be probably be less expensive.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah and I don't know if they'll give me the refill or not.
<b>DR:</b>	I'll go ahead and write that.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Do you think once the medication's stabilized, then maybe I'll feel better?
<b>DR:</b>	I think so, and also as you've been telling me about what's been going on lately, there have been a lot of changes and a lot of undercurrents like, you know, in a way your grandmother lost a family member who was with her, and you were very involved in providing that, but then you weren't involved in the decision for the dog to live elsewhere and that's hard because, you know, I personally might feel a little powerless if that happened.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, but at the same time, fortunately the dog's not living too far.  You know, it is within your power to be able to visit with the dog.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it might be a good idea.
<b>DR:</b>	That's a plus.  Um, and you know, just some of the things going on with your sisters and somebody's pregnant and so forth, you know.  Um, nobody has a right to expect any particular plans between you and your husband.  It sounds like you both work hard and be able to have a chance to get away and relax.  It sounds like you like to do some of the same things.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, and, uh, there's some beautiful, you know, walks and the beaches and, and things that aren't so far away—
<b>PT:</b>	Maybe I'll try doing more instead of sleeping.
<b>DR:</b>	And getting out in the sun would be good, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Walking the dog.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, are you able to walk the dog pretty successfully without—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he's a [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I took him for a walk yesterday.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  Yeah, phototherapy is good.  Don't forget your sunscreen, but, you know, the more time you can spend outdoors, you know, it helps send that message to that [INAUDIBLE] gland, you know, deep in our brains, you know, we try to be awake when it's light and active and then sleep better, especially, um, when it's dark.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So, and again, the companionship of the dog, even somebody who barks, you know, they're just wonderful company.  And I'll put my voicemail number here just in case you need to call about anything, and I'll fill out the prescriptions as well.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So both the Lexapro now at 20 mg and the clonazepam .5?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Could you use renewals on both of those?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, please.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, sounds good.  [DATE] isn't that an amazing date?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's supposed to be a lucky one.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, yeah.  I talked with a friend last night.  I remember, uh, her father died unexpectedly on [DATE].
<b>PT:</b>	Wow.
<b>DR:</b>	I said [NAME OTHER] every [DATE] I think of you, but especially this one and she said, uh, she celebrated his memory by going to the grocery store and getting butter pecan ice cream which was his favorite.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And, you know, she said after 20 years, you know, keeping the little things alive, you know, that you remember about someone, uh, you know, really has a lot of significance because certain things start to fade.  I said it sounds like you're remembering the important stuff, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It was a wonderful memory.
<b>PT:</b>	I heard over in China, a lot of people are trying to have their babies today.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because they're good luck.
<b>DR:</b>	Between the Olympics starting—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	And the yeah, the auspicious, uh, date.
<b>PT:</b>	Like it's a good luck number.
<b>DR:</b>	If people only realized how much control they have over their own life, too.  You know, if they kept that positive outlook more often—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Better things are going to happen.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm also going to make a note on this Lexapro that you started that dose on [DATE] with your existing supply so they don't say, wait a minute.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because then I have a refill, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm sure they'll probably give me a hard time [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I'm going to give you some samples too just to make sure you don't have to run into any bumps in the road like that.  [INAUDIBLE].  Okay, so that's for the Lexapro and then let me do the clonazepam on a separate prescription.  And would you like to do copay now or have us bill?
<b>PT:</b>	Can you bill?
<b>DR:</b>	What's that, hon?
<b>PT:</b>	You can bill?
<b>DR:</b>	Um, we probably could, yeah.  Definitely.
<b>PT:</b>	Just bill me.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	I'll send you a check.
<b>DR:</b>	That'll be fine and let me grab, um, some of those samples and I'll be right back.
<b>PT:</b>	Great.  Thank you so much.
<b>DR:</b>	No problem.  I think there's 14 in each of these, so that should cover.
<b>PT:</b>	All right, thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, it was good to talk with you.
<b>PT:</b>	It was good to talk to you [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	And I hope, uh, no problem.  Hope the summer just gets better.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, me too.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, see you later.  Bye bye.
