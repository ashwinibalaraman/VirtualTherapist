BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so [PATIENT NAME], you were here in December.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> At that time, things were stable.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>  know that there was some stuff going on with friends of the family, some things there but...
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Overall, things were going okay.  I know you were taking your medications as prescribed, working hard as usual.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> No problem with side effects.  Tell me what's been going on since then.
<b>PT:</b> Everything's been pretty good.  As far as my home life now, it's okay, I mean, there's a couple of days that I forgot to take my medicine.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  When you say...
<b>PT:</b> I thought I took it, then the next day I remembered that I didn't.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I mean when I don't take it my wife can tell. 
<b>DR:</b> When you say you forget for a couple of days, are you talking about one day every so often?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Or like two or three days at a time?
<b>PT:</b> No, not two or three days at a time.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right. Okay. You know, [PATIENT NAME], you're taking now three medications.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And look I mean, you know, we have other things going on in our lives and sometimes we forgot stuff like that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's not, you know, do your best.  I know you've been good all these years.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But do your best because...
<b>PT:</b> I mean, it's not like when I forgot it, I don't take it, I just wait till the next morning, you know...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Stick with it or try to bear with it.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I've been having some problems with my daughter. 
<b>DR:</b> She's how old now?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> [AGE].
<b>PT:</b> [AGE].  She's reaching that womanhood.
<b>DR:</b> Lucky for you.  
<b>PT:</b> She reached that womanhood.  
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So I mean as far as her grades, she would lie to us about somethings at school, and my wife's a school teacher.  She went to college to be a school teacher.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> She picks up on this kind of stuff.  My wife has a tendency to go overboard I would say.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And in my past experience, like me and my daughter bond really close, you know.  I always end up taking her side which I shouldn't but I should take my wife's because my wife's right.  I mean when it all comes down to it, I should take my wife's side but it's just about her grades.  Her grades were dropping.  She was a straight A student.  She moved up to another section and all her teachers in her group called us in for a conference.  They told us she was having all this homework and all these tests but she wasn't bringing the tests home that she was failing to get signed.  So I confronted her one time about it, just me and her, I took her out to dinner to [DEIDENTIFIED] and we talked.  She said half the time when she comes home she's afraid to tell her mother.  I said well why don't you tell me, you know, lying about school work, I mean you're still passing but they see a significant drop in what you're doing, you're not showing effort.  I said I don't want you to do that. I said be upfront and honest with us I said and everything goes smooth.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> So now we're on the same, they sent home a weekly report card for her.  So I sat down and talked to my wife about it.  I told her, I said just be a little easier on her.  I said she's going through a life change right now.  She says yeah I know, I know.  So me and my wife have been arguing about that a little bit and I could feel myself getting frustrated, you know, with it and so I took a walk and I was thinking about things and I said I ain't going to let that something little get to me like that, you know.  So she said that I've been getting frustrated an awful lot and I know it's a lot of things.  I've been thinking about my weight.  I went and had a physical done by my doctor...
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Family doctor and that's another thing I want to talk to you about is, he was concerned about my liver functions.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Were they elevated?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and I said well. He said what medicine do you take?  I said whatever's in your file.  I said I take the Depakote.  He said well that might be it.  He said, you know, but he said they're okay but he said they were a little elevated.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But anyway, thinking about my weight, I really thought about getting that gastric bypass done.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I mentioned that to you before, but the more and more I hear about it, I hear good things and I hear bad things, but I don't want to hear the bad things, you know.  So I joined a gym.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I'm working out three days a week.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you.
<b>PT:</b> And I absolutely love it.  You know, when I'm in there by myself, the gyms not crowded, not full of muscle heads, you know, it's a nice clientele. But I tend to vent out on lifting weights and stuff, you know, instead of venting out on people or myself so, but I think that's a good move because I've lost, I've only been doing it a month and I lost 12 pounds so far.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> So...
<b>DR:</b> You must be doing other things too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well I do cardio.
<b>DR:</b> No, no, I mean...
<b>PT:</b> Eating wise...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  I've been eating salad left and right and I'm going down [DATE] to see this dietician.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Down this way somewhere, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]
<b>DR:</b> Okay, don't know that name.  What kind of doctor is he?
<b>PT:</b> I guess he helps people with weight loss.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> A friend of mines' wife went to him and she lost 65 pounds. 
<b>DR:</b> How does he help people out?
<b>PT:</b> Pills.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know what kind of pills...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> They are...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's why I want to go down.  He won't talk to you over the phone but he says come in, we'll talk it out and see if, he says first I have to check your blood pressure and see if that's all, just stuff like that and so I want to go down and talk to him and see how that...
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Well there's a number of issues here [PATIENT NAME].  I think it's a good healthy thing that you're doing to try to lose some weight.  I think exercise plays a role in all this but there's a couple things with exercise and there was a study done recently that said that exercise made no difference as far as weight loss.  Some people, you know, because they're expending more energy, they're going to actually increase their appetite and eat more but the key, I mean, the key is changing your diet.  It's a simple matter of what you take in versus what you expend to burn and so, you know, there's a lot of different programs out there and there was a study done a few years back comparing, you know, the [DEIDENTIFIED] diet and the [DEIDENTIFIED] diet and all these other things, [DEIDENTIFIED] whatever, and you know what turned out to be the most effective was [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah?
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] is a really good program.  I don't know if you've ever done that before. 
<b>PT:</b> My wife tried it years ago.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  They've got a different system now and you see because dieting should be taken out of the vocabulary because it's, you could stop eating for a week and lose some weight, but how realistic is that and how healthy is that.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You really need to make lifestyle changes so that, you know, instead of having a big hunk of meat like this and a little bit of vegetables, maybe you should have a little piece of meat and more vegetables or, you know, eat more fruits and vegetables than, you know, processed foods and things rich with, you know, but so I think [DEIDENTIFIED] is the best program.   Now the other thing we can do as far as that goes, [DEIDENTIFIED] has a program and you're not taking any medicines that Lily makes but that doesn't matter.  Lily has a program that doesn't cost you a nickle and you can sign up for it either on the telephone, by fax, e-mail, whatever, and it's a program that they tailor make for you to help you lose weight.  You get on the phone, you talk to somebody, they talk to you about different things, they set up a program for you and it's worked out really well and the reason for this is that Lily made a, they still do, a competitor drug to the Risperdal that you're taking called Zyprexa.  You may have heard of it before.  Zyprexa is notorious for causing weight gain so I think that was a part of their thing to help people, you know, stay on the medicine but you don't have to be on Zyprexa or any other Lily product to be part of the program.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's a nice program.  I've had people do it and I had one guy lose like 30-40 pounds on it.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so it's an individualized program for you.  You fill out this form and tell them about your lifestyle and what you do and, you know, whatever, things like that and it's a very worthwhile thing.  It doesn't cost you a dime.  As far as the bypass is concerned, I've had a number of people who've had bypasses.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And, they've done well on it.  They've done well on it.  One lost 100 and some pounds, one lost 85 pounds, one lost 120 pounds.  Last week I saw a patient who works over here at, I think the [DEIDENTIFIED] school and one of the teachers had it and died.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> You know what I mean.
<b>PT:</b> The last I heard it was like 1 in 300.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, I don't know what the statistics are but people die from that stuff still.
<b>PT:</b> This guy's wife at work died from it.  She had all kind of [INAUDIBLE].  She was doing good then she got an infection.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, exactly, right.  This one, I'm not sure she got out or not but within a week she was dead.  Anyway, you know, in other parts, we do the bypass more than any other procedure in this country, but they have in other parts of the world they do the banding.
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> Which is more common in other parts of the world and that's something that you can remove and that's what what's her name had done, [NAME OTHER], on --you know, [NAME OTHER] wife on the TV.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> She had it done.
<b>PT:</b> My buddy was telling me, I got a buddy of mine to join the gym with me so I have somebody to work out with.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And he, because he knows, I talk to him a lot when we're at the gym, you know, he's a good guy to listen too.  He listens to you and, you know, has good information for you, but he said he heard something about the band but it's not over here yet or something.
<b>DR:</b> No, it's here, it's here.
<b>PT:</b> Oh it is.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's just not as popular here for some reason.
<b>PT:</b> But I heard, he said he heard it's real popular in other places.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  
<b>PT:</b> It's safer.
<b>DR:</b> It is definitely safer.  It is more popular.  Some people don't feel that you can get the same kinds of weight loss that you can get with the bypass, but the bypass is some serious surgery.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know, it's no joke.
<b>PT:</b> It's a whole different lifestyle change too.
<b>DR:</b> You know, I met a guy not long ago, a guy in his 30's who to me seemed heavy and he was putting down some food pretty damn good and in the course of our discussion he mentioned that he had a bypass done like a year or so before and he said he lost 140 pounds or something but, you know, like this woman I see regularly, you know, she had the bypass done, after the bypass, of course she's a woman and maybe different but she's on her third or fourth plastic surgery.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Because you know they've got to take up the loose skin, this, that, and the other, and so it's not necessarily surgery and that's it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And she said to me that you can, at the beginning you're afraid of eating because you get sick and stuff like that, you have to kind of wean back into things but after a while you start to, like anything else, you start to go back to your old ways and, you know, you can force yourself, you can kind of still make that thing expand a little bit and the worst thing is to spend that kind of risk and money, usually insurance companies are paying for it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But then to go back to the way you were.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.
<b>DR:</b> Because you don't know what kind of things you're causing changes for.  You can't take certain medications.  You can't take any time released medications.
<b>PT:</b> Huh.
<b>DR:</b> Supposedly, so it's a risk. I would say to you [PATIENT NAME] and as far as the pills go, these are things that are going to be kind of stimulants and these are things at are going to suppress your appetite so that you don't want to eat.  Again, it's a simple matter of, you know, you think of food as gas for your car.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And if you go a certain distance, you need a certain amount of fuel to take you there.  The same thing, you expend a certain amount of energy and you burn the food to fuel your body so that you can do the work.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> So if you take in and if you're net zero, in other words what you burn and what you take in are equal, you keep your weight stable.
<b>PT:</b> Stable yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If you burn more than you, you know, you need, uh, you're going to lose weight and if you take in more food than you need, you're going to gain weight so it's a simple thing of just, you know...
<b>PT:</b> You see with me working midnight shift, it's really weird.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I try not to eat when I go home, if I get up around 12-1, I might have a sandwich and I'll stay up and eat dinner around 4-4:30 but I won't even eat dinner, I do eat vegetables and now especially eat vegetables, I always did and I always eat a lot of fruits.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Of course, lately now I've been eating fruit.
<b>DR:</b> Well you know, look, it may be, it may be portion control, you know, take less food on your plate, don't go back for seconds.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> You know, I'll take the time right now, I mean obviously I'm not a nutritionist but I, so for example if at your house, you know, you have three plates set for dinner let's say and you have the food on the table, you know, when you run out of food, it's easy to go and just grab some more and put it on your plate.  One of the things they say to do is don't have the food on the table.  
<b>PT:</b> We never do, we keep it all on the stove. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you go and put the food on your plate and when it's done, it's done, you don't go back and get seconds right.  The other thing is they say, which I could never do this because I shovel my food pretty fast, they say that you should, between every bite, put your fork down or your spoon down and chew it more than you normally do.  I don't know, that might not work for a lot of people.  The other thing [PATIENT NAME], is the animals in the wild, you know, they don't eat three meals a day.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> They're always foraging through the day. So I think, I mean that works well for a lot of people, is that instead of eating like breakfast, lunch, and dinner, you have maybe four or five smaller meals throughout the day.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That keeps your appetite down and, you know, having food as a snack or something like that helps kind of curb your appetite.  Let me get that information for you on the Lily program.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's worth doing.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'd like to look into that.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] listen, when you have surgery like a bypass, if all goes well and there are no problems and you're successful you look back at it and say....
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Hey it was worth it but there's a lot of pain, but is something happens and now you have an electrolyte imbalance or you have this stumping syndrome or you get infected or you die and then you say oops maybe that wasn't the best thing for me, you know.
<b>PT:</b> I know, that's what I always keep thinking about that. 
<b>DR:</b> And it's real stuff, I mean it's a serious surgery.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they say it is.  I mean my wife knew a couple of people that had it.  One of them had major complications with it.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But the other two, they seemed to be all right with it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That guy's wife at work, she just died two months ago of it and that sticks in the back of my head, because she got an infection.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you know what happens is, it's like you're connecting things together that weren't meant to be connected together and if there's a little bit of a leak, then all that stuff goes into your belly and you develop peritonitis and you get infected and...
<b>PT:</b> I told my wife, I said I'm going to keep doing this gym thing, I mean we've got our routine down, me and this other guy.  I think we're doing good for beginners, you know, so...
<b>DR:</b> Listen, if you lose, if you lose, you lost 12 pounds in a month.  All right, if you lost 10 pounds in a month, in twelve months, that's 120 pounds. 
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> Now of course, it's not like that, it's not consistent like that.  You may go a month and not lose anything but if you can lose, you know, I mean if you lose a pound a week, that's 50 pounds.
<b>PT:</b> I cut out like all sweets.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>PT:</b> All sugar, stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], one of the people I saw that, you know, they lost weight just by cutting out desserts or just by switching from ice cream and a pie which hey is the best...
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> To something, you know, a fruit cocktail or something less fattening. 
<b>PT:</b> I'm doing, I want to do this to make myself feel better because I'm getting tired.  I get depressed looking at myself all the time, you know, my daughter's getting older, I want to be around for her...
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> You know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. [PATIENT NAME] listen.
<b>PT:</b> Stuff like that...
<b>DR:</b> You know, listen [PATIENT NAME], like it or not, you know, every day that goes by, we're older. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And as you get older, things start to fail you.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> And so you don't need to be taxing your heart to pump blood, you know, you know, you're wearing your equipment out, you know what I mean.
<b>PT:</b> We do a pretty good routine on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> First we were going at it real hard but then we talked to this personal trainer guy, since you guys are beginners, he said you don't need to be pushing all that weight.  I said well I'm just pushing what is possible for me.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I said, you know, I ain't in here to impress nobody.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>PT:</b> So as far as the treadmill, I do a half hour on it a day.  He said well that's good to start out with.  He said but after you've done that treadmill, you need to go over here to a bicycle machine, you know, and he said the weights are good, but he said as far as you, he said you've got...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, [PATIENT NAME] listen, when I had my knee surgery for both knees you know, the first thing they have you do at the rehab is get on the bicycle, get on the bicycle for, I forget, half an hour, 15 minutes, half an hour, just to get things moving, you know, get your heart rate up, get things loosened up, then you do some exercises to strengthen the area but now the work that you do, you know, you probably don't need as much of resistance training but cardio would help you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Get your heart going, get your heart rate up, get conditioned and lose the weight. 
<b>PT:</b> Because I'm going to have that physical, I mean believe it or not, and my wife gets so mad at me because she's about maybe 170-180 pounds.  She has cholesterol problems, she has high blood pressure problems.  My blood pressure's great, my cholesterol is perfect, I don't have diabetes [INAUDIBLE]. 
<b>DR:</b> But that's [NAME OTHER] you know. Hey [PATIENT NAME] I used to work with a guy that was about, he was wider than he was tall, this guy and he used to eat cheese steaks like they were going out of business and his blood, he was a doctor, and his blood pressure and cholesterol which like ridiculously low.  Hey, look he was lucky that he had good genes for that.
<b>PT:</b> I mean that's, I mean my wife can't believe it.  She works in the hospital part time at [DEIDENTIFIED] and she sees all these people come in that have it all.  Like her, she's on blood pressure medicine, cholesterol medicine.  I said hey, I don't know, I mean I ain't doing nothing out of the ordinary, it's just....
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] I've got a guy that's as big around as your finger, uh, doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, um, and has high cholesterol and high blood pressure and he's skinny as could be.  So you just never know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> One thing [PATIENT NAME] is I'm not going to tell you what to do.  I'm going to make some recommendations to you though.  Under the best of circumstances, I think taking appetite suppressants, pills, diet pills, we'll call them diet pills, is a somewhat risky proposition, okay, under the best of circumstances.  I'm not saying that everybody that does this is unethical or sleazy or whatever, but they have you come in, they give you the medicine, you pay for it.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> You're buying the medicines and who knows how much they mark them up but they're making a good profit there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.
<b>DR:</b> But the thing is, the thing is [PATIENT NAME] with your, with the bipolar stuff, those are not medicines you want to be taking.  Those medicines will upset your brain chemistry that would put you at risk to have some mood instability.  Now, I just would think that, I don't think there's an emergency here.  I think you should feel, you know, you're daughter's getting older, you're getting older, you want to be healthy, you don't want to have problems, I think you should consider it to be a priority but I don't think it's a crisis that you need to be running around, you know, like a nut trying to figure out what to do and be radical about things.  I'd like to give you information on the program.  I'd like for you to continue what you're doing, just make some dietary changes, consider [DEIDENTIFIED] if you don't want to do this [DEIDENTIFIED] program.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, give me some information on it.
<b>DR:</b> And I think that you should probably avoid taking these diet pills.  You know, one drug, that Orlistat which was a prescription drug is now available over the counter.  This is that drug that they were putting in some of these potato chips so that you don't absorb the fat as readily, that would be a consideration for you.
<b>PT:</b> So I mean if you say that, I'll cancel because [INAUDIBLE] made the appointment because she has an appointment and she talked about the money because she said she paid $100 for like two months worth of pills.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. The thing is, the thing is that, you know it doesn't hurt for you to get the information but I would almost guarantee that's what the story is and, I don't know, to me I just think in your situation it's risky.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> It's risky. 
<b>PT:</b> You know, that's why I bring it up to you because I know, I didn't know with me taking this other medicine that you prescribed for me, how that would effect and I'm glad you said something about that.
<b>DR:</b> Now, you know, huh, I just think it's risky.  Now you know, the FDA all these kids taking medicines for ADD and stuff.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> The FDA is coming down with new warnings now for risks of strokes and heart attacks on people taking those things and so that's the kind of medicine they would give you and so, you know, nothing's free [PATIENT NAME]. I mean, yo know...
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> You've got to, you've got to...
<b>PT:</b> Like I told my wife, I said I'm going to continue going to the gym because I like it a lot.
<b>DR:</b> It's fun, it's good for you mentally and everything.
<b>PT:</b> I work out on like a Monday.  Like yesterday I worked out, I felt so good, you know, my wife, I can't sleep after I'm done working out.
<b>DR:</b> You know what, are you working out too late?
<b>PT:</b> No, we work out right after work.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I work out from 7 to 9, 2 hours.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  You know [PATIENT NAME], I think exercise is one of the best antidepressants and it makes you feel good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it does.  I guess I was getting frustrated there a lot, I felt down with some things, but I mean I joined this gym, I take it out on lifting weights or...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> With running and I don't run yet.  I ain't up to running yet. 
<b>DR:</b> Take your time. 
<b>PT:</b> We walk 30 minutes, gives us about 2 miles we walk. 
<b>DR:</b> Like the saying [PATIENT NAME], it's not a sprint, it's a marathon for you, right. 
<b>PT:</b> That's true.
<b>DR:</b> You're looking at the long term. 
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I feel so much, I don't feel as tired.  You know, I mean, I was seeing this pulmonologist, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And after that sleep apnea.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>PT:</b> He prescribed me this pill called Provigil. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you know what, I was going to mention that to you.
<b>PT:</b> But I don't see him no more so I can't get it no more.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know what, see Provigil is a, did it help you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Provigil is a stimulant that it works differently than the drugs like the Adderall and the other drugs for ADD and I was thinking that might be an option for you.  I was going to recommend that to you, Provigil because it's nowhere near as risky or potentially problematic in any way for you.  It's a good safe drug and beside sleep apnea which, it's used to promote daytime wakefulness, it is a good drug because it will probably curb your appetite a little bit.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah because it helps me get through the night. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, I have samples I can give you.  I can give you a prescription if you want that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, if you can give me a prescription.  I had an appointment to go see my family doctor so he could prescribe them for me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, all right. Well, I could do that.  Let me see.  This is, this is the thing for the program.
<b>PT:</b> The [DEIDENTIFIED] thing?
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, check that out.  I think there may be some other, I may have to give you some other information on that, but try that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, definitely.
<b>DR:</b> You've got all the information you need there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it tells you what to do, call or e-mail or....
<b>DR:</b> This is, I think, this is my information here but take a look at this, this is just kind of some of the things that they do and let me get those samples for you.  I think that's what we should do then [PATIENT NAME] okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], how much were you taking of Provigil?
<b>PT:</b> Oh...
<b>DR:</b> 200 mg?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was taking, yeah I was taking 200, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, take those and then we'll just continue with the other medications as we did before and I'll write you a script for the Provigil.  Try it out and see how it goes all right.
<b>PT:</b> It worked for me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well it's good stuff.  You know, the insurance companies don't want to pay for that, but if you had a sleep study done and you have sleep apnea, they'll cover that for you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they were covering it before.
