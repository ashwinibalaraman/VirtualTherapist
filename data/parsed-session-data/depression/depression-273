BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Easy enough.  That's for you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So, what's going on?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't feel that this Strattera is really working for me, I feel a little bit better, I think but um, I don't know if you can increase that dose, what about, I think I'm taking 60 -
<b>DR:</b> We can do whatever we want.
<b>PT:</b> I think I -
<b>DR:</b> You need 60?
<b>PT:</b> Sixty.
<b>DR:</b> That's a little.
<b>PT:</b> So, how, I don't know how high you can go with that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's, you know, somewhere between 60 and 120 or somewhere in that range -
<b>PT:</b> Oh okay.
<b>DR:</b> So there is room to go with it.
<b>PT:</b> I still didn't really, I still didn't, I think, kind of manicky and running around but then depressed, but I quit smoking a couple of weeks ago so, maybe, maybe that could be it but I was feeling like that before.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know, it's, it's certainly a potential factor in what we're doing here is, you know, now you're going through nicotine withdrawal.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm using a patch?
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's good, what's the mg strength on the patch?
<b>PT:</b> I'm doing 14 I went -
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I went 2 weeks for the 21 -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay, how much were you smoking?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, about a half a pack, pack and a half a day.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so how much longer -
<b>PT:</b> I got to do, I'm just going to do it for, I'm going to do 2 weeks of the 14 mg and then it goes to 7.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> For another 2 weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and then just stop.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean I have to, I can't imag, I can't even breathe anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Is that right?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I was walking across the room and getting out of breath, I've been smoking since I was 10.
<b>DR:</b> You have asthma too or not?
<b>PT:</b> I was doing breathing treatments at the doctor, I had chro, um, bronchitis.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I'd had smoker's bronchitis for a year, for a long time now.
<b>DR:</b> Are you on any medication for, like, you know, steroid medicine or anything -
<b>PT:</b> No, huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> All right, good.  Well, um, so quit smoking, but also if you stayed sober.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I did.
<b>DR:</b> Which is really impressive, are you impressed with yourself?
<b>PT:</b> Eh, not really.
<b>DR:</b> No really?
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, well I had, I had to drop a class at school.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, it was more, I was getting the prop, when, when he was testing us, I was, you only got so many minutes to do, it was a finance class, you only had so many minutes to do the problem -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And each problem was taking me, you know, 10 minutes, 10 to 15 minutes when we only had 4 minutes to do the problem.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So I wound up dropping the class, I'm going to take it over the summer and just kind of study the chapters that will be -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah , well -
<b>PT:</b> At least I can use the same book, the $150 book -
<b>DR:</b> Can, can you use the same professor so you don't -
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to do, I'm doing it online, that's the only way it's offered over the summer.
<b>DR:</b> Oh okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm going to need to practice in the meantime, you know, get up to speed.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So do they charge you for the course?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't get a refund at all so -
<b>DR:</b> Geez, you don't get a discount if you didn't do it?
<b>PT:</b> No, but I just didn't want to take that F in class, you know, you almost have to do it, it's just I haven't been studying lately, I had an episode Saturday night.
<b>DR:</b> Well what does that mean?  What's an episode?
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Well I was um, arguing with my boyfriend and I -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> He was provoking me, I felt, so I physically attacked him -
<b>DR:</b> That's usually not the best way -
<b>PT:</b> Bit him -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He called the police on me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, how long have you known this guy?
<b>PT:</b> Um, year and half.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So police came?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And?
<b>PT:</b> Well they was, you know, I was upset and I was crying and you know, they wanted to know what kind of medications I was on, well, I hurt my back on, like last week, something happened with my back and I kind of blew it off as cramps -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Like monthly -
<b>DR:</b> Yes, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Cramps.  And I just think anything of it, it's, well I'm just having cramps well then it got worse and worse and then Saturday came and I was like, you know, I got to the doctor because -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I couldn't even walk.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So they gave me a muscle relaxer and something for inflammation -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, like what, like Flexeril?
<b>PT:</b> Flexeril, they gave me Flexeril and which helps, because like now I'm completely fine.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know, so I took that for a couple days and the police officers wanted to know what happened -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I told, well the girl, he says he didn't call the police, he says the girl upstairs, the little girl upstairs, my boyfriend is, you know, kind of a big dude -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So she assumed that he hit me -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Which he didn't, once I put, you know, I went after him, he did push me into the closet.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But she assumed, you know, so when they came -
<b>DR:</b> You both sober?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're fighting over what?
<b>PT:</b> He was mad because I didn't come to his daughter's birthday party or something.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I wasn't feeling good, I had this issue with my back -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I was at the Urgent Care up at [DEIDENTIFIED] and it was just stupid -
<b>DR:</b> So one thing leads to the next and then -
<b>PT:</b> And I'm not -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know I seem to get along well with everybody -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Else, you know what I mean?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But when I'm provoked, you know, I get a little psychotic.
<b>DR:</b> So what, so what did the police do?
<b>PT:</b> They wanted to know what kind of medication I was on, blah, blah, blah and I showed them all the bottles and you know, I called my mother because I thought I was going to jail, so -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, are you on probation for anything?
<b>PT:</b> No, no and I told them, you know, I was -
<b>DR:</b> So they know your history from looking in the computer probably some -
<b>PT:</b> Well I figured I hurt, they wanted to know what my Social was, and so I'm like oh man, you know, and so just to let you know I do have a criminal record and you know, I was sober for almost 4 years and I said I've been relapsing since last June, I was completely honest with them -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah but you were sober at the time they came.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well then the guy blamed it on the, on the, on the -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> What is that, Flexeril?
<b>DR:</b> Flexeril, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He said some people have a bad reaction.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I'm not blaming it on that.
<b>DR:</b> Ye, Yeah, I know -
<b>PT:</b> I know perfectly, I mean, this isn't the first time this has happened with the boyfriend, I mean, I just, I don't know and then once I get myself so upset it's like hard for me to like calm myself down, like -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I can't calm down, like once I reach that -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's, I mean, I literally think somebody like needs to give me a shot just to knock me out.
<b>DR:</b> Well, uh, it could be done but I need to be in the psychiatric ward and for that to uh, happen in a regular -
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I think I need to go there, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Let's take a look at this, history here of all this stuff, I mean, you, we had you on lithium back in '07 -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then in '08 your, let's see, January, February so March of '08 so we go January of '07, so over a year goes by -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So you stopped taking it because why?
<b>PT:</b> Was it weight gain maybe?  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> But you were, I mean, over a year without coming in -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, probably because I was staying sober and feeling better, you know, I was -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Felt like I, but I still have having some episodes, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and then we get you on Abilify and that, and then we changed around some other meds and that was last summer.
<b>PT:</b> But this, let me back -
<b>DR:</b> And then, and then the fall we restarted the Lamictal -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah but this is the only medication I have been faithful -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> In taking -
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>PT:</b> Every single, all the other ones, I don't really -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't believe I gave them a chance to work.
<b>DR:</b> Let's see what -
<b>PT:</b> I was too sporadic in taking them, missing days and -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> This medication that, you know, since the last what, since I've been coming -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, since the fall.
<b>PT:</b> I've been, you know, I've been taking them how I'm supposed to take them, every single night.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And then -
<b>DR:</b> Generally it seems like it's enough to get the job done and then every once in a while you still have some issues that the Lamictal doesn't quite manage.
<b>PT:</b> Hm.
<b>DR:</b> But it always seems to be with this boyfriend.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum, I know.  I don't know but I think, well, even aside from him, I'm still kind of getting a little bit manicky and then down, I think I still have a, a mood thing going on.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know what I mean?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Are you taking any hormone pills?
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm not taking anything like that, like what birth control or something?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, sometimes estrogen can have an impact on Lamictal which case you would need more Lamictal -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It would still work but you'd need more, so, so that's not a factor.  Manicky -
<b>PT:</b> Like, kind of like, right, getting everything done -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I hear you.  Do you feel like the Strattera adds to that or makes it better?  What I mean is makes that more likely to happen or less?
<b>PT:</b> More likely to.
<b>DR:</b> The Strattera to make you racy and irritable or edgy or any of that stuff, manicky is -
<b>PT:</b> I don't really notice a difference.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> To be honest with you.
<b>DR:</b> But do you feel that the Strattera helps you focus?  At school a little bit?
<b>PT:</b> Oh maybe a little bit better, not where I want to be.
<b>DR:</b> Because potent, I mean in a way, Strattera sort of works like an anti, like a lot of the antidepressants, antianxiety drugs work.
<b>PT:</b> Oh they do, okay.
<b>DR:</b> In a way -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's a ser, it's an norepinephrine chemical messenger so it could make this stuff worse, we're hoping it makes you more focused and calmer.
<b>PT:</b> To make it worse, like that.
<b>DR:</b> Could, any, any of ADHD drug it's, it's like a activating, energizing -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Potentially make you more irritable and racy, we're hoping it, it improves your focus.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's the goal, right?  I mean that's what we're trying to get out of this.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum, well like the Vistaril doesn't do anything for me so I don't know -
<b>DR:</b> Okay, nothing?  Well why, let's stop it.
<b>PT:</b> I don't think, I don't think it really does anything for my anxiety.
<b>DR:</b> It probably doesn't do a whole lot.
<b>PT:</b> And it's pretty milder drug isn't it?
<b>DR:</b> For sure, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So if you're looking at medicines that provide some mood stability and you probably don't want to restart the lithium, right?
<b>PT:</b> Maybe, I don't know, do you think you want to increase the Lamictal?
<b>DR:</b> We could bump up the Lamictal and we can also increase the Strattera but generally speaking, you know, if the manicky stuff continues -
<b>PT:</b> I see what you're saying.
<b>DR:</b> We're going to need to look at something other than Lamictal, I think.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Not in place of -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Probably but in addition to.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Which I know isn't a lot fun to think about but -
<b>PT:</b> I'm to, you know what, I'm to the point where if I come and see you every 2 weeks, I mean, I got to get a handle on this already, I'm getting, you know, I just, that's why I'm taking it, you know -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Every night and not missing-
<b>DR:</b> Because it's really hard to beat lithium Lamictal, but we don't have to use lithium, of course, we can look at some other mood stabilizers that you haven't been on.
<b>PT:</b> The other thing is, is that the Lamictal is the only thing that I've taken, you know what I mean, they've -
<b>DR:</b> What about, what about Topamax, you remember when you took that one?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do.
<b>DR:</b> What are your thoughts on that?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think I ever gave, anything like I said, anything else a chance to work, except for the -
<b>DR:</b> So we think, weight was the issue with lithium and then we had you on Paxil, we had you on Neurontin, we had you on Seroquel, you remember what happened on any of those?  Had you on Gabitril
<b>PT:</b> Seroquel gave me that hangover.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I remember that.
<b>DR:</b> Yep it can, certainly can do that.  And the, what is, you know other than cocaine, alcohol has been a problem as well.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Right, any other drugs that were mainly big drugs of, of use?
<b>PT:</b> I smoked marijuana for a lot years but I, I stopped doing that when I was, probably 10 years ago, I haven't really, alcohol and cocaine was the main, I haven't had anything in over a month now.
<b>DR:</b> Great.
<b>PT:</b> Well.
<b>DR:</b> That's excellent.
<b>PT:</b> And I've been going to AA meetings.  I haven't gotten, since last June, I have, I have not gotten to daily use, you know what I mean, like I was in -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> What, '90, '97, '98, and then again in, you know I was a daily user back then, I haven't been a daily user since then so, it's been more binging, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Vistaril and then Abilify, what was the deal with that?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think I knew it, I don't think I really gave that one a chance really.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> See that's my problem, if I don't feel a difference [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum right away.
<b>PT:</b> It's like oh, it's not working or the other thing is, there's nothing wrong with me, I don't need it.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right, right, yeah I get a lot of all of that.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  I bet you're so -
<b>DR:</b> And the Campral you never took because it, it wasn't covered, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but in the end they gave me, you know what if I, she was saying, well, you know, prescribe maybe a couple weeks of it.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> That way I could just pay for it, well she said it takes, this is what I wanted to ask you -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Does it takes a couple weeks to get in?
<b>DR:</b> Nah, I mean, it's pretty expensive too, she didn't have any samples of it?
<b>PT:</b> I don't, no she didn't, I called her actually about that.
<b>DR:</b> Hm, okay, um, have you ever taken stimulant medicines like Ritalin?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Concerta, um, none of that stuff.
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and then you were also on Depakote and you took Trileptal, huh?
<b>PT:</b> I don't ever remember taking Trileptal.
<b>DR:</b> Really.
<b>PT:</b> Depakote yes.
<b>DR:</b> Trileptal -
<b>PT:</b> When I was incarcerated I took -
<b>DR:</b> She's been trying multiple medicines including Trileptal.
<b>PT:</b> I don't remember that one.  I really don't.  I remember Depakote.
<b>DR:</b> Hm, well what happened on that one?
<b>PT:</b> Oh that one was, that was like a, I didn't like that one at all it made me feel like lethargic -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I could have been on too much of a dose.
<b>DR:</b> Probably yeah, that's a dose related side effect and then you were on Paxil.
<b>PT:</b> I couldn't orgasm on Paxil.
<b>DR:</b> That's okay the number one side effect -
<b>PT:</b> That's a problem.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Is it really the number one side effect?
<b>DR:</b> On, on Paxil, I mean it's not for everybody but -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> For some people it's like a great medicine, whatever, it's not used a lot because of that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Which is unfortunate because for a few people it doesn't cause it and it works.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So Lexapro, you remember that one?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do remember that.  Do you think, you're thinking that val, Lamictal is not for me?
<b>DR:</b> I like Lamictal, I think it is for you, I think it's done a great deal in, you know, since we've restarted it in the fall -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So -
<b>PT:</b> I seem to, I mean at least I'm showing up for treatment.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah,  I mean it's a good, it's a good drug for -
<b>PT:</b> That's exciting.
<b>DR:</b> I'm just, you know, uh, looking at this, is it going to be enough, I mean time will tell, there's, there's only so many different options that -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Are out there, um, there's a handful of different atypicals that you haven't been on, those are the mood stabilizer antipsychotic things like Abilify and Seroquel.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So Risperdal, Geodon, I like Geodon, you haven't been on that.  So, we got Risperdal, Geodon and Invega.
<b>PT:</b> Now, what are those antipsychotics?
<b>DR:</b> They are all antipsychotic mood stabilizers.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Zyprexa, you never taken that?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> That comes -
<b>PT:</b> I never even heard of any of those.
<b>DR:</b> It can cause some weight gain, so, so you haven't been out, so there's 4 right there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then you think, you don't remember taking Trileptal.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And that's a good option.
<b>PT:</b> And that's the other thing is I needed that other stuff, you know, I never gave, like I said, I never gave it a chance to work so I really don't even consider -
<b>DR:</b> And then BuSpar.
<b>PT:</b> That's supposed to be for anxiety isn't it?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So, BuSpar's a possibility.
<b>PT:</b> That's an additive to process.
<b>DR:</b> It's a serotonin agent but uh, more for anxiety, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, let's do this today, let's increase the Lamictal and uh, the Strattera just a little bit and we'll go from there.  So now we've got a nice history of a lot of this stuff.
<b>PT:</b> And what about the anxiety?
<b>DR:</b> So we won't have to do this again.  Anxiety, again, should be managed -
<b>PT:</b> With the Lamictal?
<b>DR:</b> With, well, not only Lamictal but really the sero, the norepinephrine component of the uh, of the Strattera.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> It is off label, you know, but, but has been reported.
<b>PT:</b> That's the other thing is I'm not sleeping well at night either, so do you think that maybe the Strattera taking it at night, can be doing that?
<b>DR:</b> I mean, did we talk about that?  Because -
<b>PT:</b> Remember I said I was eating, like I took it in, in the mornings -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I ate something and I still got extremely nauseated.
<b>DR:</b> Before, you eat, before you take the medicine.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I still got really nauseated and then you said take it at night -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it could keep you up, I mean -
<b>PT:</b> That's what I was wondering maybe I should, I'll try taking it -
<b>DR:</b> It could keep you up, there's no doubt about it, I don't know if it comes in 80, let's see.  That would be nice if it came in an 80, then it would just be 1 pill, or I supposed you could take 2, 40s, I mean that would be a little different.  You know, then you could take it in the morning and at night.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Let's give you an 80, there's an 80.
<b>PT:</b> There is?
<b>DR:</b> Let's just do it and then, you know if you switch around though from morning to night, do it for a couple days just don't go back and forth.
<b>PT:</b> And the Vistaril just stop taking that?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, if it's not helping.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so we're going to do this and then we're going to do Lamictal 150 mg pills 2 of them.
<b>PT:</b> I'm taking, oh okay, because I'm taking 200 now.
<b>DR:</b> And you should be taking that at night, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, 200 I take at night.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, all right, we'll get this figured out.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right?
<b>PT:</b> And then I need to see you in about -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, fine, you know, set it up up front, all right.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then uh, you know, we've gone through the history now of some options, so -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> We'll know where we're headed.  All right?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Good luck, stay sober, that's impressive.
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to a meeting tonight.
<b>DR:</b> Don't discount that, this is good news.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> No more fighting with people.
<b>PT:</b> Isn't it terrible.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Good to see you, take care.
<b>PT:</b> Take care.
<b>DR:</b> Thank you, you too.  All right, well that was a fun night.
<b>NR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, busy, busy, busy.
<b>NR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
