BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, how're you doin?
<b>PT:</b> I'm all right.
<b>DR:</b> So, what's new?
<b>PT:</b> Please take me off the Prozac.
<b>DR:</b> It's not working, or you having problems with it?
<b>PT:</b> It is bad.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, no.  What are you noticing?
<b>PT:</b> Like, I don't even wanna get out of bed.  I don't even wanna do my house.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, no.  Oh, no.
<b>PT:</b> I feel like crap.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I was okay for like the first 2 weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> When it was still combined, I think with the Effexor.
<b>DR:</b> But after the Effexor was gone.
<b>PT:</b> After the Effexor was gone, I feel like crap all the time.
<b>DR:</b> Like, is it depression you mean?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I sit on my couch and do nothing.  I haven't been sleeping.  I've been having nightmares, I mean, I'm just
<b>DR:</b> That's terrible.  You see, if anything like that ever happens, you need to just call me before the appointment.  You don't have to be miserable, okay?  'Cause if it's not working or causing side effects, I wanna get you off of it, so, yeah, we'll definitely get you off of it.  So, yknow, we'll definitely get you off of it.  So, you've been depressed, you have nightmares, you're not sleeping.  Are you having trouble getting to sleep?  Are you waking up during the night?
<b>PT:</b> Um, like every single hour.
<b>DR:</b> Waking up like once an hour.
<b>PT:</b> And that's even if I make it to sleep.  Otherwise, I usually just sit there and watch the clock.
<b>DR:</b> And you can't get to sleep some nights.
<b>PT:</b> Last night I finally fell asleep because I took Xanax and took 2 Simply Sleep pills.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  That sounds terrible.  I would say just stop it.  You don't have to taper off it.  Just stop it.  It'll, it'll tape itself out of your system, but we'll drop it right away.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if the Effexor was doing more than I thought it was, but
<b>DR:</b> It's possible.
<b>PT:</b> The Prozac was.
<b>DR:</b> Prozac isn't the right one, it sounds like.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, let me ask you some other questions.  How's your energy during the day?  Do you feel tired or you have an okay energy level?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it's weird because I work with an assistant and I think being around somebody that has higher energy helps me.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But usually, I don't, I mean, I don't know what a normal energy level is.
<b>DR:</b> Because you feel tired?  Okay.  How's your appetite been?
<b>PT:</b> I've gained like 8 pounds in the last month.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  That's unusual, okay.  Are you hungry or eating more?
<b>PT:</b> I'm just eating and like sitting on the couch.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, is it, um, you have low motivation?  Like you just don't wanna do anything?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  What about concentration?  Are you able to focus okay, or is it difficult?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's not.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, it varies.  Are you getting much enjoyment out of things?  Or you just kind of go through the motions?  Have you been having any suicidal thoughts?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think suicidal, but definitely, I wish that sometimes I wasn't here.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, what about, uh, last time we talked, I think you were going to see your gynecologist.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  She changed my birth control pill because I was on the 1's that had different hormone levels like every week.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And she said that that can throw people off so she took me off of that, which was the, it was the generic Orthotricyclene, and she put me on the YAZ instead.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Which she said has the same hormone level.  She said if that doesn't help enough, then she can, um, skip my cycle for like about 4 months at a time.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, to stop my irritation, agitation, all that junk around it.
<b>DR:</b> Now how are you doin' on the [INAUDIBLE]?  Has it just been like a couple, 2, 3 weeks or something?
<b>PT:</b> It's been since I saw you last.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so about a month.  Do, have you noticed any difference with that?  Or has it been hard to tell?
<b>PT:</b> It's been hard to tell.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.  Um, okay.
<b>PT:</b> I do notice when I did have my cycle this time, I wasn't as irritated or as grouchy.
<b>DR:</b> That's a good thing.  Okay.  What about stresses in your life?  Any new stresses?
<b>PT:</b> Um, my dad's getting married.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, when?
<b>PT:</b> January 18th and he just kinda invited us all up for a barbecue and just told us and we haven't met her.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I was gonna say you know this lady, you don't even know this lady.
<b>PT:</b> No, I actually, it turns out, I knew who she was through the salon that I work at because she gets her nails done there and she's friends with 1 of our nail technicians.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Each of my sisters have met her 1 time.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.  Do they like her?
<b>PT:</b> My little sister refuses to talk to my father or her or have anything to do with them.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> She doesn't like the woman, or -
<b>PT:</b> No, she thinks that my dad is completely desperate and it's ridiculous and it's all just a joke.
<b>DR:</b> Ah, is this woman his age?
<b>PT:</b> She's like 8 years younger.  She's 51, my dad's 60.  I mean, for us, it's not a big deal.  My parents were like 6 years apart.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah.  So, it's not their age so much, it's just that - 
<b>PT:</b> I like her.  I think that she's nice.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know her very well.  I know that she had alcohol and drug addiction problems, but she's been clean for like 15 years.  She goes to church.  I mean, she's really, really nice.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But, my older sister hates her just because she hates her.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, it's putting a lot of stress on the family.  Okay.  All right.  That's enough.  Any other stresses?  Work goin' okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, work's okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Social life okay? Not so good?  What's happen' there?
<b>PT:</b> I don't wanna be around my boyfriend because I don't wanna be around anybody.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b> So, he gets upset with me.
<b>DR:</b> So, have you just not been seeing him much then?  Okay.  Okay.  Hm.  And are you still seeing [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> I see him today, actually.  My boyfriend's gonna come with me today. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  How often are you seein' her now?
<b>PT:</b> Once a week.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Is that goin' okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, okay.  Anything else goin' on now?  Any other problems or stresses?  Okay, yeah, it's just you've been feelin' awful.  You're not sleepin' well.  Um, I guess what I'm thinking about is what you said, the Effexor may be doing more than we thought and do we go back to that, or do we try something completely different?  Because we have a lot of other choices.
<b>PT:</b> I only know is I don't wanna take that Prozac any more.
<b>DR:</b> No, no, we'll get you off that.  Let me read back through my notes to see when you were on the Effexor.  Let's see, well I have down then you were having trouble staying asleep then, you were tired, you were, how much do you weigh now?
<b>PT:</b> Like 166.  I weighed myself this morning.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you were [INAUDIBLE] last time.  I'll write that down so we can keep track.  Okay.  That's weird because if anything, Prozac usually causes weight loss but you're just having a bad reaction to it, it sounds like.  Um, let's see -
<b>PT:</b> And that, like, freaks me out because it took me, I lost like 50 somethin' pounds.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> So, it freaks me out to gain that weight.
<b>DR:</b> I understand.  Well, so we wanna stay away from medicines that'll cause weight gain.  We wanna stick with something that's weight neutral.  Unfortunate, the antidepressants, there'll only a couple that can sometimes cause people to lose weight.  One's the Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Which you're already on.  And then, the Prozac sometimes does.  There are a couple of those in the Prozac family that are different than Prozac.  Sometimes it'll help, we like Lexapro.  Have you ever heard of Lexapro?
<b>PT:</b> See, and before I was on Wellbutrin, Lexapro, I was on 450 mg of the Wellbutrin and only 10 mg of the Lexapro, and I thought that it was okay, um, but my doctor only wanted to raise the Wellbutrin and that's where we kind of stopped.
<b>DR:</b> I only wanted to raise it to
<b>PT:</b> Before he messed with the Lexapro at all.
<b>DR:</b> So, I don't quite catch you, were you okay on the 450 Wellbutrin and the 10 of Lexapro?
<b>PT:</b> It was okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Because we can't go above 450 on Wellbutrin, you can have seizures, but we can go higher on the Lexapro.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> If 10 isn't enough.  Do you want to go back and try Lexapro again?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That worked the best of anything you tried so far, do you think?
<b>PT:</b> So far, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, so let's go back to it 'cause that's a real good combination.
<b>PT:</b> Um, and I know that my insurance company before had called [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and said if it was okay with him, there was some kind of generic brand or something that's close to it.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> That they wanted me to try instead of the Lexapro to try and keep my costs down.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  It's called escitalopram.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> It's related to Lexapro.  It's not the same, but it's related.  Some people try it and think it works as well, some people say it doesn't work as well.  It is cheaper.  So, if cost is an issue, you wanna try it, we can.  If you don't wanna take the chance, we can go with the Lexapro.
<b>PT:</b> I'll go with Lexapro.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  That sounds fine.  Um, and yknow what we can do, let me give you some samples to get you started on it to make sure it's working okay before you go out and pay for a prescription okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I stopped the prescription yesterday of Prozac.  I went to pick it up and said no, I don't want it.
<b>DR:</b> Good, that's good.  Here's 2 weeks worth of Lexapro, 10 mg, so you can just start back on those.  You can start them today if you want, if you want to wait until tomorrow you can.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Like I said, the Prozac's gonna be gradually leaving your system, um, and it usually takes about 3 to 7 days for the Lexapro to kick in again.  Um, so, if it was me, I'd pry start on it today just to get it in my system.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> When you were taking that combination, did you feel pretty good most of the time with the Lexapro and the Wellbutrin?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  That's probably the best direction to head in and again, we had reviewed just Lexapro's dose.  The maximum dose of Lexapro is 20 mg a day, but it's such a safe medicine, even if that isn't working, we can go a little higher.  But, with the Wellbutrin, we don't wanna go any higher than 450.  That's dangerous if we do, so.  Uh, and the good thing about the Lexapro, it can kind of help us on the premenstrual irritability, too.  Okay, any question about the Lexapro?  Did you have any side effects with it before that you remember?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  I wouldn't expect you to this time either.  It's one of the most well-tolerated medicines, anti depressants, out there.  Let me get your prescription, too, assuming that that's gonna work.
<b>PT:</b> Um, can I get another prescription?  I had my one last refill for Wellbutrin.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> So, should I get it from you now or next month?
<b>DR:</b> Either way's fine.  Do you have a preference?
<b>PT:</b> It doesn't matter to me.  'Cause I have 1 refill left on it.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  We might just wait a month.  You don't have to carry this around for a month.  And if you ever need it before an appointment, just call me or call the pharmacy and I can always okay it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Whenever you need it.  I just don't want you running out.  Let's see, [PATIENT NAME], which pharmacy do you use?
<b>PT:</b> Um, the WalMArt off of Hallers and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Hallers and [INAUDILE] okay.  I'm not sure where that 1 is.  I didn't even know there was 1 out there.
<b>PT:</b> It's a newer 1.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> My boyfriend lives over off of Constiution and [INAUDIBLE], so usually I just stop by there and pick up [INAUDIBLE].  Because my WalMart is really bad.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, is it?  Which 1 is that?
<b>PT:</b> The [INAUDIBLE] 1.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, uh-huh.  Okay, now the Lexapro you can take morning, noon or night.  It doesn't really matter.  Most people take it in the morning because sometimes it can give you a little boost in your energy and may make it a little bit harder to sleep at night.  If you take it and feel a little bit tired, you can switch and take it at nighttime.  It doesn't matter in terms of its effectiveness, okay? 
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Do you remember when you took it before?
<b>PT:</b> In the morning.
<b>DR:</b> That's when most people do.  I'm gonna write for 30 with 5 refills on there.  So, again, you can go ahead and start the samples and make sure that it's working for the first 2 weeks and if all's going smoothly then there's a prescription for 30 more with 5 refills.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, we'll get you the Wellbutrin next time so you don't run out of that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And like I said, if you're for some reason running low, just call me.  And the Xanax, you're doing okay with it, too?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I kinda of frightened the pharmacy 'cause I picked that up yesterday.  Some how they had in the computer that I was given a 90 day supply of it, and I was uh, no, 'cause I'm out and I swear the bottle said 45 pills.
<b>DR:</b> Forty 5, right.
<b>PT:</b> She was oh, aren't you at like 1 and a half a day as needed?  And I was like yeah and she said yeah, so somebody put it in the computer wrong so, everything worked out.  She fixed it.
<b>DR:</b> Good, okay.
<b>PT:</b> And we got everything straightened out.
<b>DR:</b> 'Cause yeah, there should be a couple refills on that one 'cause I called it in like, or I gave you the prescription last month for 3 months' worth with 2 refills.
<b>PT:</b> Right, and I just refilled it for the first time.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And that's keeping your anxiety level under a reasonable control?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And you're not having any problems in terms of it causing you to be tired that you can tell, after you take it?
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, during the day, I guess at night, it helps with, well in theory, it should help you get to sleep, but it hasn't been.
<b>PT:</b> Well, and I ran out of it, too, so I was out of it for like 2 days.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you missed it.
<b>PT:</b> So, but, it was
<b>DR:</b> Okay, any other problems, [PATIENT NAME] you can think of?  Any other concerns or, okay.  So again, it's gonna take a little while for the Prozac to get out of your system, so hang in there.  Well, what can you do in the meantime?  Hopefully the Lexapro will start kickin' in.  Take the Wellbutrin.  If you have any problems, will you call me?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> I don't want things to get any worse.  I want them to start getting better, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Let's check back in a month to make sure this is working, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And then we can adjust the Lexapro if we need to.  Okay.  Let's see.  And what I'll do is I'll call [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], oh, you're seeing her tonight you said.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> I might just leave her a message letting her know we're switching medicines, too, so she's aware of that.  Let's see a month of now, is gonna be around the 10th of October, that week, um, mornings are best for you?  Or afternoons?
<b>PT:</b> Um, probably early afternoon.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, let's see, Monday, the 8th is Columbus Day, does that matter to you?  Is that a good day or a bad day or?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So, I've got like 1:00 or 1:30 that day if that works.
<b>PT:</b> How about 1:00?
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Eigth.  Would you like a card also?
<b>PT:</b> No, I have [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right, so you're gonna call if you have any problems, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  I just don't want things to get any worse.  I just wanna get goin' in the right direction.  Okay.  All right.  Well, have a good week.
<b>PT:</b> You, too.
<b>DR:</b> We'll get you feelin' better, all right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> See ya later.
<b>PT:</b> See ya.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum, bye bye.
