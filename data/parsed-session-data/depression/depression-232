BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Well, he's applied to school, he says.  Is that true?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	He says he applied to tech a couple times and hasn't gotten any, uh.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I'm just going to do it myself.
<b>DR:</b>	Na, don't do that cause then you'll have to do his homework.
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING] I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b>	But you would.  I mean, if he wants it he'll get it.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, it took me 8 years to go through [DEIDENTIFIED].  If I got to class and I didn't like the content, if I didn't like the professor, if there was something about it that did not appeal to me I quit going.  If I liked it I had good grades, if I didn't—
<b>DR:</b>	A little grandiose huh?
<b>PT:</b>	Huh?
<b>DR:</b>	A little grandiose.
<b>PT:</b>	That's why it took me 8 years to get a bachelors' degree.
<b>DR:</b>	Sometime—
<b>PT:</b>	If didn't like it I wouldn't do it.
<b>DR:</b>	Sometime our determination and stubbornness can not be in our best interest.
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING]  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So when did you learn to pick your battles?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, my dad's brother came to [DEIDENTIFIED] for some purpose, I don't know.  We had, um, it was some of my dad's family living here and, um, we were all in the, we lived in [DEIDENTIFIED], part of them lived in [DEIDENTIFIED] and my, my cousins lived here, uh, until my uncle came up here for some purpose, just visiting.  And, uh, I was working at [DEIDENTIFIED] and, yeah, I wasn't typically doing anything.  I was cute, I got good tips and, um, he said, "How long are you going to sell hot dogs for a living?"  And it hit me, "I'm not going to do that."  So I went back to school and—
<b>DR:</b>	How long had you been there?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, probably 6 1/2 years.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  You learned a lot of things that time I'm sure about yourself and—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I had such major depression then, I mean, major, major bad problems.  Um, I remember I had an apartment that faced [DEIDENTIFIED], uh, well it was on [DEIDENTIFIED] and I think it was at the bottom of one of the hills where the road, uh, dead ended there at [DEIDENTIFIED].  And I used to sit on my bed and look out the window just all night long, I'd just sit there.  And I had, um, somebody I owe a great deal to, he, uh, he sat next to me in, um, in biology and he took me by the hand and said, "Well, this is where we're going."  And he took me to [DEIDENTIFIED] and, uh, somebody needed to do it.  But he and I were friends and he recognized it.  I didn't know what was going on but, um, I have a portrait of me done somewhere in that time and I look like I was on some kind of really stiff drug and I was not.  I looked like my focus was far, far away but I wasn't, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	You weren't?
<b>PT:</b>	A lot of people thought that I was on—
<b>DR:</b>	Hum.
<b>PT:</b>	That I did a lot of drugs.
<b>DR:</b>	You were just depressed, not just depressed but you were depressed.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That's interesting.  Yeah, a lot of times you look back at pictures of, parents bring pictures of their kids and you can line them up and see.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And then when they do that they go, "Oh, my."
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Because it can be so, you know, gradual onset and—
<b>PT:</b>	I think I was depressed even with I was very, very young.  I've seen pictures of me, you know pictures of kids usually have, um, they have kind of a, little kids 3, 4, 5 years old have kind of a sparkle in their eyes and you can see the excitement in there.  I have a picture, there's a picture of me and I look, I looked depressed.  I'm smiling but there was no joy in it.  But, uh, I was dating, uh, uh, he was working on his PHD in history and he told me, he said, "I thought you were into some really heavy duty drugs and I thought you were always on something."  And I said, "No, I don't take anything."  You can tell that now but I, I just floated down the street, you know, I did not, I don't know.  Just major, major depression.  But when my uncle said that to me I thought, "Good grief I'm not going to do that forever."  So I went to school again, got my degree and started teaching.  So that's what did it.  I still remember those words very clearly and my reaction to it like, "Absolutely not.  Huh-uh."
<b>DR:</b>	What, um, I'm sure that's nothing [INAUDIBLE].  Sorry.  How is your mood now?  Of course.  There we go.  [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b>	Is that your ring tone?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I guess.
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING]
<b>DR:</b>	I guess it is.  Whatever my kids put on there.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	They figure I can hear that.  They think I'm deaf I guess.
<b>PT:</b>	I had to take back my thing.
<b>DR:</b>	What is your mood like?
<b>PT:</b>	How is my mood?  Something that I find myself doing that I did when I was depressed after [NAME OTHER] brother died, I count everything.  When you got up and walked over there I started counting the lines on the, the plaques behind your head.  I count everything.  I just, I count everything.  Not, um, like I haven't counted the stems on that because they're not regular, you know, it's, it's an uneven pattern but when there is pattern to it I count everything.  When I brush my teeth I count the strokes.  When I was my hands I count the strokes.  When I stir my coffee I count the stirs.  Um, count how many times I chew.  I count everything.  If I wasn't looking at you I'd be counting the blinds, I'd be counting almost, uh, just constantly counting something.  I don't think that's, I don't think that's [LAUGHING] really very productive.  Uh, I did it when you have a digital clock you know the numbers are made to move seconds.  I would sit and count those, count the numbers, the number of seconds in a particular time and see how many times I could count them in that bed and then I'd start all over again with the next minute, 12:15, 12:16.
<b>DR:</b>	That wears on you after a while, I'm sure.  Did you ever stop doing it at all?  Any length of time?  Did you tell yourself, "I'm not going to do that."
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes I stop myself from it but, usually, but um, I don't think that's a good sign.  [LAUGHING]  Cause I had done it mostly, one time I memorized license plates.  [LAUGHING] Like I'd know if I'd seen one before and sometimes even when it was, well a lot of times were it was.  What is that?
<b>DR:</b>	OCD.  The obsession is, uh, the number of the orderliness or control in knowing and compulsions of the doing, of the counting, and the more you do it the more difficult it is to stop it.
<b>PT:</b>	I see that.
<b>DR:</b>	There's, your sons of it that way a bit, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	What does he do?
<b>DR:</b>	Does, it does tend to run in families.  It's this need for control and about the environment and knowing how things are going to be and not wanting change and.
<b>PT:</b>	Have you met my husband?  [LAUGHING]
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I guess you have in a kind of secondary [INAUDIBLE] sort of way.
<b>DR:</b>	Isn't he a bit the opposite?
<b>PT:</b>	He was just changed like, oh he really misses change.  He wants to be in complete control.
<b>DR:</b>	So he's, his environments pretty, you know what it looks like?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You wouldn't even have to be there and you'd know where things are?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah that's OCD.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh he's, he's very, very, um—
<b>DR:</b>	I was thinking he was more free spirited and not hung up on.
<b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.  His music, but he's still very compulsive about it.  Uh, he's a little bit like "Monk".  You've seen that show?
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, there, there will be no finger prints, no specks of dust on any of his excellent things.  Uh, there will be a schedule for when he changes the strings on each of his upteen guitars.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  So it's a bit worse then yours.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, he's an adult child of alcoholics.
<b>DR:</b>	Yours is more things have to be just so, I would guess.
<b>PT:</b>	If I wasn't, if I didn't have such a scattered way of looking at things I would be, I would be worse then my husband.  I can't organize things like I want them to be in my head because, you know, I don't I don't have a straight line to look at anything.  It's like this.  I have a tipped deficit like crazy and it, it's really frustrating.  And I remember the time, I remember the moment that I decided I can't make things as perfect as I want them to be.  So it was like just throwing up my hands completely.  There was just no way I could, with my attention deficit there was no way I could be as, as obsessive as I want to be.  That, that sounds weird but that's really, that's uh, the truth.
<b>DR:</b>	You pretty sad?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm sad.
<b>DR:</b>	How's your work?
<b>PT:</b>	I really dislike it.  I, I enjoy what I do.  I enjoy it and I enjoy the people.  Uh, my, my patients and I do very well with those.  Um, uh, but uh, I do get to put out a bulletin.  It had more numerical errors in it, I mean, I have taught school about 3rd grade and there are things that she got wrong in there that I taught.  Stuff like that just drives me crazy.  How did you get, how are illiterate people in charge of anything?  I mean it just, it just drives me crazy so I go around with the pens and [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHING] I correct the, the mistakes of the bulletins hanging on the wall.
<b>DR:</b>	So it sounds like its back to the, your expectations of you being pretty high.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah that's it.
<b>DR:</b>	And unfortunately though when people have high expectations of themselves, even perfection, they don't like hearing this but it's true that they have higher expectations of others and when they don't meet them you get frustrated.  And all you're asking for in competence, just, you know, common sense you might say.
<b>PT:</b>	Well if you're going to put out a bulletin it should be nematically correct to me.
<b>DR:</b>	According to [PATIENT NAME] but for the person putting it up that may not be as important.
<b>PT:</b>	Evidently not.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, mostly the content is, mostly the contents there and sometimes it doesn't say what you know they want it to say.
<b>DR:</b>	That's one of those things that you and your son struggle with is that control of things around you knowing all the time you can only control you.  You both do this.
<b>PT:</b>	I know to change yourself you have to change the way you respond to whatever.
<b>DR:</b>	Well you can't change others.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	But you try and you're frustrated when you can't.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, [NAME OTHER] said, he said, "I didn't mention [NAME OTHER]."  And I don't know if that was a little subtle message to me or not.  I think it was more of a subtle.  He said that you all talked about they're, um, last time [INAUDIBLE] we went to Ohio to see her and this summer she came down to see him.  My, uh, my requirement was that she be at least 18.  And, uh, so she came down and spent, I don't know, a couple of 2 weeks, something like that.  Um, then she went back home and they, I guess evidently they, they each have a phone that leads to their heads but, um, her dad is, evidently, has anger management problems and, uh, he smashed some of her things.  He smashed her new computer that she bought herself with her graduation money, she graduated from high school this year, etc.  So last weekend, 3 days ago, 4 days ago, well last Saturday he snuck out and drove to Ohio with her.  And he came back with so much stuff, she had to haul a book bag, a tote thing on her lap, I had one under my feet, and we had 2 dogs and 3 cats that she brought with her.  Could be, uh, the car was absolutely loaded down and, uh, here I am taking care of [NAME OTHER].  [LAUGHING]  And I thought, you know, after I get [NAME OTHER] there and, uh, I heard from [NAME OTHER].  She's, uh, she's a nice young girl.  She's very nice.  Um, they said something about, um, I'm almost ashamed to say thing but I will.  I paid for her plane ticket to come down here and we went to the beach and, you know just, he took all of us out.  The poor child lives in the middle of a 14 acre corn field, far, far away from everybody.  Um, her, her home town is, is tiny, tiny.  I'm trying to think if they have any, I think it's like McDonald's, I guess maybe they do.  I don't remember.  But anyway, um, I brought her down here and showed her around and she had a good time.  So, uh, you know until she gets back.  But, um, I couldn't believe it.  I expected [NAME OTHER] to be a little more grateful.  I said, "I flew your girlfriend down there and, you know, I spent $1,000 directly for her, you know, for her [INAUDIBLE], a nice beach hotel and almost $600 for her plane ticket, etc.  So he said, "She's not my girlfriend."  I said, "Then what is she doing here?"  He said, "Well, she's just a friend and I wanted her, I wanted her to have a nice graduation from high school present."  I was floored.  Cause that's—
<b>DR:</b>	He's a caring kid.  Sound like—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	Sounds like mom.  Worry about everybody else.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I couldn't believe it.
<b>DR:</b>	How's your medicine been, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm having trouble remembering to take in on an exact schedule.
<b>DR:</b>	You want me to get [NAME OTHER] to remind you?  He'll do that.
<b>PT:</b>	He did for a couple days.
<b>DR:</b>	Did he?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Put it by your tooth brush.
<b>PT:</b>	The one I keep in the shower or the one I keep in the bathroom, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	Not, uh, whichever one you use.
<b>PT:</b>	I use both but I have, I have [LAUGHING] 4 different tooth brushes.
<b>DR:</b>	Well maybe you need to just use 1.  Put your medicine beside it and, cause it does help you, at least it has.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Uh, I guess I need to start with some maintenance drugs, some Xanax, uh, cause I've had more of those, many, anxiety attacks.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I opened the door to throw trash away the other day and, uh, I couldn't, I didn't even go get the broom.  All I did is throw the trash in the bin and, uh, I was, it was awful.  I had to run out of there.  Uh, once in a while, and I don't know why I get, you know, I'm sitting on the toilet, I never close the door because my bathroom is in my bedroom and my bedroom door is closed, it's down the hall, etc.  Uh, it's very private but the door is always open.  There's a window, uh, sometimes I get a, I've had a thing in there as I watch like I can't get out of there fast enough.  But the Xanax will take care of that but I think I need to do a maintenance kind of little bit of it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You need refills?  Actually you don't.  You're getting 120 Xanax, uh, for a month.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	So you can take them up to 4 times a day.  You got to take the Lamictal in particular.  You got to get over that and you know really at 100 mg a day if you continue to have these ups and downs we can go up on that dose but need you to take your regular first.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Same for the Cymbalta, you know, we can go up to a higher dose of that if needed.  But need you to be on a regular dose first.
<b>PT:</b>	I, I don't feel right now as good as I did.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] March was not a good month.  Not taking your medicine daily plays a roll certainly.  Thinking about changes, moving or selling the house, it's stressful.  Enter.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	I know but that doesn't mean it's easy, you know, it's still stressful.
<b>PT:</b>	You know it's, uh, it's life.  I mean you, you I've got to do the things.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, uh, I agree but that doesn't make it easier.  I'm just trying to help you understand why.  Maybe it's not all your fault, which is how you tend to see things.  You blame yourself.
<b>PT:</b>	What else do you do then?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, sometimes things, [PATIENT NAME], just are.
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING]
<b>DR:</b>	You know, it's just how it is and you, like you said you deal with it or you don't but there's no body to blame.  [NAME OTHER] said he needed a prescription.  Do you know what that'd be for?  I think it's, uh, what?
<b>PT:</b>	Sorry?
<b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER] said he needed a prescription.  Do you know what for?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I guess Xanax.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Does that help him?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Is he taking anything to help him sleep at night now?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, first off that at night far as I'll walk.
<b>DR:</b>	Because the night is day you mean?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	We could get him something in the school that would be so much better.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	I know he, he worries about not being able to do the work and failing.
<b>PT:</b>	Does he?
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  I mean schools been tough for him.  Math in particular, sciences.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That's boring.  Can't help that either.  [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b>	Huh?
<b>DR:</b>	He took care of you though.
<b>PT:</b>	He did.
<b>DR:</b>	You going to the beach again?  I heard you made it down once.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	That's a pleasant surprise.  I'm glad you did.  Maybe you'll get there again.  I think he would.  He sounded like he had fun there.
