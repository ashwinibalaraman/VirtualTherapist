BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>PT:</b> I like this pen.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's, uh, gel pen.
<b>PT:</b> I like these a lot more than the other ones because they write in a finer line.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Go for it, tell me what's going on [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> Um, okay.  A lot of changes since last time.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Decided that, as far as the marriage aspect of things, that was just not, just not working out.  I mean we were going through the motions of just doing what we were supposed to.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know, just going to work and coming home and just not working out very well.  Um, he decided to start seeing somebody.  I was like, okay, well, you know, that's, but you wanted this, okay, fine.  Um, so he, I told him that it would probably be just be best if he left, I mean, honestly, if, if that's where it's going, then, that's where it's going.  No point in fighting, what I can't really control, so he, um, got in a -
<b>DR:</b> I know that marriage works on a shaky ground for quite -
<b>PT:</b> Very much so.
<b>DR:</b> Some time.
<b>PT:</b> Very much so.
<b>DR:</b> Um -
<b>PT:</b> Years.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Years.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, but he signed a lease for an apartment in [DEIDENTIFIED], last night was his last night -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> At the house.  Um, just -
<b>DR:</b> So it's just you and the kids?
<b>PT:</b> [COUGHING], it's going to be from today on.
<b>DR:</b> From today on.  Okay.  Okay.  How are you, now, remind me, are you working full time?
<b>PT:</b> I was and then I left because money.  I mean the experience was amazing and I, I liked the job, I was really good at the job -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But by the time that I handed my entire paycheck over to the daycare for 2 kids, I still owed them money.
<b>DR:</b> Ahh.
<b>PT:</b> So that just wasn't really working out at all.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.
<b>PT:</b> But the problem that I'm having is that with him moving out, obviously we need to try to get me more a little bit more financially independent, but the only thing that I can do, as far as, as far as, like working nights to get the kind of cash that I need, I mean because if, if we need milk, diapers -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know whatever.  I've got to have -
<b>DR:</b> Sure.  Everything.
<b>PT:</b> Cash.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Right there.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So the only thing I could do was try to find jobs that was kind of catered to my personality?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Let me kind of be open and just outgoing and -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Bartending.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Bartending.  So got a job at [DEIDENTIFIED], actually -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Out in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Oh, on [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's killing me.
<b>DR:</b> Off the [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, it's killing me.  It's so much fun, it really is.  But the only problem is, is that I realized that with drinking that's not something with my type of personality and the situations going on in my life right now, it's not a very positive choice for me to be doing.  Because I realized it's so easy to pick up, pick up a drink.  You know, have 2 or 3 of them.  You forget.  You know, you kind of, you kind of numb yourself, you kind of just forget.  And I know better.  I know myself.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> If I can just, and I mean, just can't.  I'll give it to you and I'll serve it to you and I'll do my job -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> As far as me drinking it -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I have realized in the last couple weeks that, that would -
<b>DR:</b> That would really -
<b>PT:</b> Start to be a problem for me.
<b>DR:</b> Really mess you up.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That, that's what I'm saying that would, that would really start to be a problem for me.  So, I've kind of had the conversation with a couple of the people that I work with and I'm like, look, you know, you guys all sit around after we close and we drink and that's fine.  I'll hang out with you, but, but -
<b>DR:</b> Why not just go home?
<b>PT:</b> I've kind of got a couple people that I trust, because we still have work to do after we close.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b> I told them, I said, look, couple of the, the, okay, I grabbed a couple managers and a couple bartenders that I work closest with and I said, look, you know, I respect you for what you're doing, but I'm just asking you to kind of don't, don't make fun of me when I'm, not drinking it, don't, you know, don't push it on me, just accept that it's a, no.  And just spread the word.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> That's it.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Just, just trust me.  I know what I'm doing.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I really know what I'm doing.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I went through a couple nights, the first couple night, you know, that whole party atmosphere kind of got to me.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> No.  No.  It, it's okay to go in to work sober but you should be leaving work sober too.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> It's 7:00 in the morning.  It's like, you know -
<b>DR:</b> Are they open all night?
<b>PT:</b> No.  But we have, you know,
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you have work to do.
<b>PT:</b> From a weekend -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> We have, um, usually a house band is there on Friday night.  But then on Saturday night it's always a really big concert.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um and so there's a lot of people coming through the doors and it's just, it's a mess, everything is sticky and there's bottles -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And the trash and it's just a mess to clean up and that's a really big place.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> It usually takes us 3 to 4 hours to get -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Every thing done, bottles counted -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> The doors locked, people out -
<b>DR:</b> So who watches your kids when you're working?
<b>PT:</b> Their daddy.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, oh, okay.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Their daddy.  That hasn't changed.  That is one good aspect of all of this -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Is that he realizes that there are going to be things that I need to do -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And he's going to have to work with me.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> He's going to have work with me.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Period.  He also, I, I laid it down on the line in a way that would make sense to him, which is, look, you can either keep these kids, you know, and help me help you, essentially, because the more money that I can bring in and the more that I can provide for them, the less you have to worry about.  So, or you can just be a jerk and not have any thing to do with them, but -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know what, you're going to be paying a price essentially, because if you can't me get a job -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Then I'm not going to be able to pay any of my own bills.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So I think he understood that, I just had to lay it on a line -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> That I knew would work with him.  But, just, you know, I -
<b>DR:</b> And your medications are working out really -
<b>PT:</b> We, we -
<b>DR:</b> Really, well?
<b>PT:</b> Have lowered the dosage on the Remeron and -
<b>DR:</b> And Seroquel.
<b>PT:</b> That needs to go right back up.  That Seroquel, I, I, tried it, I told you, look, let me finish my job -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And then I'll give it a shot.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> That stuff kicks my butt.  I am not going to lie.  It kicks my butt.  I get sleep -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But, I'm so drowsy and just out of it the next morning, it, I, I'm not comfortable taking that.  Period.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Just, I'm not comfortable because I woke up one morning and realized that [NAME OTHER] had to go to the doctor's office.  I had to get [NAME OTHER] to come home because I didn't feel confident that I could drive.
<b>DR:</b> Hum.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, and, and, we might need to look at something else for that, that's not as, that the side effects aren't as extreme.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Especially with it just being me.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I need to be able to -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Get up should they need me, I've got to be able to do that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But and then last -
<b>DR:</b> Uh, do you have Well Care or  Amerigroup?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] actually.
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  Well they cover Geodon.
<b>PT:</b> Never heard of it.
<b>DR:</b> Which is in the same family as the Seroquel is, but it's a lot less sedating than the Seroquel is.
<b>PT:</b> That was, more than happy to give that a shot -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But that stuff.  I'm so little too -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's like, there, there are people that I've had, I had a random conversation with a lady in the doctor's office the other day about it and she asked me how much I was taking.  And I told her and she was like, and you're such a little person.  And I told her, I was like look, but, it, it works.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not saying it doesn't, it works -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It does its job.  It's just too, it's probably just too much for me, given that, you know, okay if I'm tired, I can't just lay down when I'm not.
<b>DR:</b> Plus you're working nights also messes up the schedule.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm working nights and I think it's just, it's a lot.  It's a lot.  Just not happy.  I'm really just, not happy.  I just feel depressed and just the suicidal feelings and the thoughts.  It just, in the last like, few weeks, it just started hitting me.  They just, they'll come and I'll just do this whole like, I'll just sit down, and usually the first thing I can, it's usually at night.  It's like when the kids are in bed and I get to thinking, then it's like, you know, because I only work sometimes Wednesday, but Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, and I'll be up all night.  So, like if I'm just up and I'm thinking on my nights off and stuff, then it all starts to just kind of get to me.  And best thing that I've found to kind of do is just kind of, I read a lot, so just pick up a book, just pick up a book and be it starting a new one or just picking up a book, just turning to whatever page I can and just read.  Just kind of, take a step back and just read.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But it's gotten, you know, it's just, it's gotten pretty bad.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> The Remeron is the antidepressant part, uh, uh, that we are definitely going to step up the dosage and -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] really scary -
<b>DR:</b> The 45 mg.
<b>PT:</b> For me to have those feelings again.  It's really, really scary.
<b>DR:</b> And I'm hoping that they'd also, uh, remind you that you need to be on, under the treatment -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Oh no, I know that.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] last time you were -
<b>PT:</b> I'm in this for the long haul.  This is not, this isn't going any where, I've, I've kind of resigned myself to knowing that.  That this isn't going to just go away on its own.  I mean I'm not going to wake up one day and it's just going to be gone.  It's going to have, I look at it as something that always going to be there, but it's my job to kind of keep it at a maintainable level.
<b>DR:</b> Under control.  Absolutely.
<b>PT:</b> It's the best that I can do with that.  It's just really, really scaring to get to that point and I mean there have been a couple times where I have just picked up the phone and called my cousin and I'm like, look I know it's 3:00 in the morning and I know that I don't make any sense right now and you're not going to have a clue what's going on, but just talk to me.  Just don't want to do anything stupid, just talk to me.
<b>DR:</b> Also the alcohol also makes, messes things up.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> It won't let medicine do its job.  And no drugs, right?
<b>PT:</b> No drugs.  I made a lot of mistakes in my life but thankfully that has not been one of them.  I just didn't expect those feeling [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um, let's, let's see how you do with the increased dosage of the Remeron and, uh, adding the Geodon.  And if you have any problem with Geodon, call me.
<b>PT:</b> What are the normal typical side effects of it?
<b>DR:</b> Uh, nausea, dizziness and very rarely it can cause restlessness.  If that happens, you need to call me, with, with the restlessness.  If you, if you feel like you're tired -
<b>PT:</b> Well, if I feel restless I can take a Klonopin.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I mean -
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  And most time it calms you down.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> It's only 5% of the time, it does the opposite [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Well I wanted to also bring up since, since we are doing a new medication, about a month ago, um, I was having really, really bad chest pains.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Just excruciating chest pain.  Took myself to the doctor -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And they sent me, they did an EKG really abnormal, EKG -
<b>DR:</b> What way?
<b>PT:</b> Um, they apparently how, in the heart when your heart beats it goes up really high.  But you know the, the ones, the little peaks that -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, they were flipped, completely the wrong way.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So essentially what they said was we need to get you to the cardiologist.  We need to get you to there today.  They made me go to [DEIDENTIFIED] -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Again, I've got, when they did the echoes and everything, my heart is smaller than it should be and there's fluid around it.  So, I don't know what they're going to do with that.  But -
<b>DR:</b> But you're going to follow up, uh -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> With the cardiologist about it.
<b>PT:</b> Absolutely.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I don't think we need to mess with the Geodon, if you're not sure about the heart status.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> He said it's not, it's not my heart beats that are the problem -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  Then, then no worry.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> It just what, it's the way that the muscles are working in between the heart beat.
<b>DR:</b> The muscle is not -
<b>PT:</b> No, it's fine.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, but in between the heart beat -
<b>DR:</b> So muscles are not contracting properly because of the fluid.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, pretty much.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So we either drain the fluid or we try to find a medicine through them that, that will kind of take care of it.
<b>DR:</b> Did, did they say why, what caused it?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.  Nope.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> I told them I had, I had told the doctor when I first started going there, I said, look, I said its really weird, I said, sometimes I feel like, like my heart will just beat harder than it normally would for a moment, or I mean, just a moment or two and then I'll just kind of catch my breath.  I said but that is so rare.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I said it's so rare and she said something like it was the word, arrhythmia?
<b>DR:</b> Arrhythmia.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She said it probably, that you know, a lot of people have that and as long as it's not really frequent or as long as it doesn't interfere with your daily activities -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> It's normal.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Um, but it started coming faster and faster.
<b>DR:</b> But you never had EKG prior to this?
<b>PT:</b> I had, they were always normal though.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> They were always normal.  It seemed like whatever was going on, made my heart act like that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know, 5, 6, 7 times a day.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Instead of, instead of just maybe twice a month I would notice it.
<b>DR:</b> Hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Usually if I, usually right when I woke up or when I was about to fall asleep.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I would notice it, but it was doing it a lot more.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And so that EKG could pick it up.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> She could pick it up.  So -
<b>DR:</b> Hum.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, [PATIENT NAME], um, I will see you back in a month.  And call me if you have any problem with the Geodon.
<b>PT:</b> That's what I was -  What, I mean, well what do I do as far as if that continues and just, if I keep feeling like that and, I mean -
<b>DR:</b> You mean the suicidal thoughts?
<b>PT:</b> Do I trust myself, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> No.  No.
<b>PT:</b> Do I trust myself enough to -
<b>DR:</b> You need to call me, call your family, your close friend or go to the ER.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm getting to a point -
<b>DR:</b> If you're having thoughts about -
<b>PT:</b> In the last 2 weeks to be completely honest and lay it on the line to where it's harder and harder and harder to make that go away.  I used to be able to just rationalize it.  I've got 3 kids, what hell am I thinking about.  That doesn't work any more.  All those things that I should be living for and all those motivating factors that should be keeping me from even being slightly motivated to do that, it's like I'm not to that.  I can't -
<b>DR:</b> I, if, if, if, if you feel that you may not have enough control you may need to go to the hospital before you do something stupid.
<b>PT:</b> It's just scary.
<b>DR:</b> I know you have attempted suicide before, [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> Well that's why I'm saying -
<b>DR:</b> If you call me -
<b>PT:</b> That's why I'm being this honest now because if I could do it once -
<b>DR:</b> You can do it again.  Absolutely.
<b>PT:</b> I would, I would try it that much quicker.  And I talked to a friend of mine, couple weeks ago, and I told him, I said look, you're my best friend, so I'm kind of going to be honest with you and let you know what's going on because I need to talk to somebody.  I said, you know, this is what's going on and he said, you know, he said, I, I understand.  I said, really you don't.  I said you've never, you have those thoughts and you count on, you said, you know, you've, you've had those feelings twice, twice, but yet, you've just went to bed and you look at the next morning and everything is fine.  I said, that's not how it is with me.  I said, that's just not how it is.
<b>DR:</b> Do you think you need to go to the hospital now?
<b>PT:</b> Not now.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sure?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're not having any thoughts about suicide?
<b>PT:</b> Not right now.  No.  I was -
<b>DR:</b> You need to call me.
<b>PT:</b> About a week ago -
<b>DR:</b> You need to call me.  I need a commitment from you that, that -
<b>PT:</b> I will.  I mean I will.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, not at 3:00 in the morning, 3:00 in the morning I want you to go to ER.  But, uh, otherwise, you definitely need to call me or your family or friends.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> This is not normal to have these thoughts.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you can't trust yourself to respond.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I know that I would, I would pick up the phone no matter what.  I know at least that.  I mean, I know that it, it takes a lot for me to get to pull myself out of that.  But it takes half the effort for somebody else to pull me out of it.  You know, it's, it's easier for me to kind of just be like, okay, this needs to stop now.  Period.  And walk away from it.  It's easier if somebody else is yanking me out of that because it's a lot harder for me, I feel like I'm fighting my own head on that and I'm pissed off.  Because it don't feel like my head should be telling me to do something that I know is wrong.  I feel like it's just, the whole thing is just betraying me.  Like my whole body, it's just letting me down, just letting me down.  Everybody else is normal, nobody else has to do this, it's easy for, everything is so easy for everybody else.
<b>DR:</b> Hang it in there, [PATIENT NAME].  All right.  See you back in a month.  Okay?  All right.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Thank you.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
