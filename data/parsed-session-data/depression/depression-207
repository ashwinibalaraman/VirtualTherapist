BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, um, at present you're 47 obviously.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, for a few more months.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay. All right. You're full time employed, right?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, absolutely.
<b>DR:</b> And you were first diagnosed you had bipolar diagnosed was when?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, doc, I cannot tell you.
<b>DR:</b> Approximately.
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to say '98 or '99 and I was in denial about it.
<b>DR:</b> So bipolar was diagnosed in 1999.
<b>PT:</b> Manic depressive bipolar.
<b>DR:</b> Same thing. Same thing. Um, since then until you saw me first time in July of, no not July, yeah, July of 2005, that 6 year, had you had any psychiatric hospitalization between 1999 and 2005?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> How many?
<b>PT:</b> One.
<b>DR:</b> One hospital admission. And you have attempted suicide during that period of time?
<b>PT:</b> I would not attempt it, I would do it.
<b>DR:</b> So you never attempted?
<b>PT:</b> I never attempted suicide. But it does run in my family.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. And I saw you on July of 2005, at that time you had major depression.
<b>PT:</b> My personal doctor said I was having a nervous breakdown.
<b>DR:</b> That's a layman's term, yes. And I thought that you had bipolar type II. And the last visit I had with you in the office was.
<b>PT:</b> Just a couple weeks ago.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, September 25. Now tell me what happened between September 25 and now. What things are kind of falling apart?
<b>PT:</b> Well, first of all, we've never been able to, when I first come to see you in July you highly recommended and I refused to go into this day treatment or some type of a hospital and I refused and you put me on medicine. And the medicine helped a great, great deal. I have been to 4 different psychiatrists and they've put me on Lithium and they've done other things and none of that stuff worked. And when I come to see you I was real skeptic but I was reaching out for help. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I needed help. And, uh, if you'll remember that session, you were going to try to put me on some of the same pills that the other psychiatrists has and I said no way, we're wasting our time and then we finally come to agreement on some stuff that worked. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And it still works to this day. But the thoughts that go through the back of the, the negativity thoughts that I have in my mind about, then it's fear about my family basically right now my 23-year-old daughter and suicide and how I have went about treating her and raising her and her having 3 children and 3 different fathers and 2 of them are in jail and the 1 she has now is a meth dealer and how she's attracted to dealers and I've tried loving her into right behavior. I've tried tough love. I've tried everything to do. And I cannot control the negative thoughts that go through the back of my head and they are not, uh, voices. I don't hear voices. They're not, they're not, uh, nightmares, they're not, they are realistic perfectly, uh, capable of happening thoughts.
<b>DR:</b> Like what? Give me an example.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I have a daughter that's 23. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> She has 3 kids which are foster care parent - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Which are took by DHS - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh, she's on drugs and, uh, I have a father and two brothers that committed suicide and, uh, knowing how much she cares for those children regardless of her drug addictions and behaviors.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I can't help but think that she is one bad decision away from taking her life. I think I can see when she's around them, I can see her behavior, I can see how much she loves her children. And I'm terribly, I have a terrible fear that she's going to take her life.
<b>DR:</b> At this time is it your main concern about her safety or through her safety you are trying to draw my attention that you are also thinking in the same line?
<b>PT:</b> I'm sorry, doctor.
<b>DR:</b> As if you are thinking, to simplify, are you concerned about her committing suicide or are you thinking about you committing suicide?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no. No, no, here's the thing about me. If I decide to commit suicide I will do it. [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Do you have such ideas now?
<b>PT:</b> No. No. But I will say, I will say this, I'll say that the positive things in my life, and I have many, is not worth the negative in my life.
<b>DR:</b> What happened to your dad?
<b>PT:</b> My dad worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He got, uh, uh, uh, about 2 weeks after my youngest brother died, he stuck his service revolver in his mouth and blew his head off. 
<b>DR:</b> What happened to your younger brother?
<b>PT:</b> My youngest brother died drunk at his graduation party at his.
<b>DR:</b> Is it accidental death or intentional, your brother?
<b>PT:</b> You know, I would lean towards accidental, but at the same time very careless behaviors -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Caused his death.
<b>DR:</b> And you had another brother die?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, he's older brother, he died in the county state penitentiary of a drug overdose on Christmas Eve. And I truly believe that was suicide.
<b>DR:</b> So you are sure, this is for sure that your father died of self inflicted gunshot wound?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, my dad ended his life.
<b>DR:</b> Your younger brother died of alcohol poisoning, but you are not absolutely sure that that's a suicide or not?
<b>PT:</b> No, I cannot, I can, no.
<b>DR:</b> How old was he when he died?
<b>PT:</b> Eighteen.
<b>DR:</b> Wow. And the older brother, um, died in penitentiary?
<b>PT:</b> On Christmas Eve of a drug overdose.
<b>DR:</b> And that was, you're sure was suicide?
<b>PT:</b> Well, doc, uh, you're pretty lonely on Christmas Eve -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And you're in a penitentiary serving 5 years -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And you die of a drug overdose, once again I'm assuming.
<b>DR:</b> How did he get drugs in a penitentiary?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, hell, you know more about that than I do. Drugs are just as accessible in the penitentiary as they are on the streets.
<b>DR:</b> Describe your mood now.
<b>PT:</b> My mood now is that it's unfixable and what I have I'll have to live with for the rest of my life. And my best chance, all I want to do is be happy. And my.
<b>DR:</b> How sad or mad are you now?
<b>PT:</b> Man, you've got me medicated enough so I really don't have anger and you have to remember that the membership that I'm in, the group that I'm in, uh, I no longer have the luxury of harboring resentment and anger. Of course I'm human and I do get angry and I do harbor resentments, but I am very quick to recognize them and call my sponsor or do whatever I need to do in order to not be angry and resentful.
<b>DR:</b> If I give you a scale of 1 to 10, 10 the worst sadness or depression you ever had, where are you today?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I would be a 7 or an 8.
<b>DR:</b> And how angry are you in the same scale 1 to 10?
<b>PT:</b> Gosh, anger, I'm angry at myself.
<b>DR:</b> I'm asking the number.
<b>PT:</b> I know, I'm trying to figure that out, doc. Give me a chance to process it.
<b>DR:</b> Take your time.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I would have to rate it a 5. 
<b>DR:</b> How many days - 
<b>PT:</b> And I also have to say that I'm not real sure.
<b>DR:</b> How many days has been that you have not had good sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, shoot. Definition of good sleep?
<b>DR:</b> You went to sleep and wake up rested in the morning.
<b>PT:</b> Can't remember.
<b>DR:</b> Tell me what kind of sleep you have since our last visit.
<b>PT:</b> I have terrible nightmares. Our last meeting my sleep.
<b>DR:</b> What about 2 weeks ago?
<b>PT:</b> Was the incident with my daughter testing positive for meth and the things that went on down there, my grandson tested positive for meth, and I was called my older daughter and believe it or not even though I'm a parent sometimes the best advice you can get from your children which we will always call children but I have no children, they are adults, and she said the best thing that could happen is that she would go to jail for a year.
<b>DR:</b> Your daughter? [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> My daughter, my oldest daughter which is a foster care parent which has adopted the first two children. And then she cannot adopt this third child because now she has too many children and they just will not allow her to adopt this child. 
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> So what was the question, I was headed somewhere with that.
<b>DR:</b> How have you, last 2 weeks, total how much sleep you had?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, gosh, I'm not.
<b>DR:</b> Best guess.
<b>PT:</b> I have nightmares. I wake up 6 or 7 times every hour. I'm up at 3:30 in the morning. Sunday night I didn't sleep at all. Monday night I didn't sleep at all. Last night I got probably about 4 or 5 hours of sleep.
<b>DR:</b> So on an average you are getting anywhere between 2 to 4 hours per day?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Are you having any racing thoughts in your mind?
<b>PT:</b> They're not racing thoughts. They're very organized, very thought out, very realistic, very, uh, reality.
<b>DR:</b> When was the last time you had a very racing thoughts in your mind that 10 million things going on?
<b>PT:</b> They're not racing thoughts. They are constant thought that is there almost 24/7.
<b>DR:</b> And these constant thoughts are related to what?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, several things. One being is my daughter and, and, um, the last conversation I had with her if she decides to take her life and sitting there at graveside looking in a coffin thinking that did I do the right things. And my wife is using me as a whipping post and so I have nobody to console in or.
<b>DR:</b> What did she say, your wife?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, my wife just brings up things that are completely irrelevant to what's happening today and in the last year. Wife and I separated for like 3 years from 2001 to 2004 and I filed divorce twice on her. I was living on my own. I walked away from everything, uh, filed divorce twice offering full disclosure, she could keep it all, just stay out of my 401k and my pension. Everything was hers. And she said she lost the papers, so she never received the papers. And I was going on with my life and there was other females in my life and those females constantly get shoved up my nose even though I haven't seen or talked to them for 3 years.
<b>DR:</b> So she's going back into the past and.
<b>PT:</b> She lives in the past.
<b>DR:</b> And holding you responsible for your affairs?
<b>PT:</b> Yes. My affairs. My affairs. When you file divorce and you're living, living by yourself in an apartment and you have a relationship is that an affair?
<b>DR:</b> Um, that's a tough call.
<b>PT:</b> You're making me sound like I'm committing adultery.
<b>DR:</b> Um, I'm not giving you my opinion.
<b>PT:</b> I know, but when you say affairs, I take that as adultery.
<b>DR:</b> The reason I used that term is I have heard such behavior considered as affair and I have heard such behavior considered as I'm single so I had a relationship.
<b>PT:</b> That's what I was looking at.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, and I have heard both sides. 
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And the question is, I am not a person to pass a judgment on this because no matter what the tradition is, my job is to bring stability to may patient's life and not judge them from the moral and legal standpoint. My focus is only medical and medical only. Okay. Are you having any kind of hallucinations now that you are hearing voices?
<b>PT:</b> No. I've never in my life heard voices.
<b>DR:</b> How about seeing something unusual or bizarre when you are awake?
<b>PT:</b> Seeing things with my eyes that aren't there or?
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Like you know, as if a shadow walking around and your wife sees nothing there.
<b>PT:</b> No. 
<b>DR:</b> Paranoia that somebody is after you?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no. I embrace no fear of that so that is just is not a feeling that I would have. 
<b>DR:</b> Are you having any kind of panic attack now?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, you had me pretty well medicated there, but yes I do have still have minor panic attacks and I think that's why you had just, that one pill that you gave me to take care of that. My panic attacks when I have, do you want to know what a panic attack is to me?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Get the hell away from anything and everybody, shut the phone off, go get and be by myself because anything and everything causes my heart to go 90 mile an hour -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And it causes me to repel, it causes me to, I just don't want to deal with anything. I don't even want to go to work. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to deal with nothing. My panic attacks are not 5 minutes long. Of course the initial panic attacks are where I can't catch my breath and, yknow, my mind is just going plumb crazy and stuff. But it lingers on.
<b>DR:</b> And look at me and tell me and this is no rambling, straight, when was the last time you seriously considered killing yourself? No rambling. I know you carry a gun so I need an answer straight. It is very critically important question for me.
<b>PT:</b> Two weeks ago.
<b>DR:</b> Tell me a little bit more about that. What was going on through your mind at that time? Was that before or after the session that I had on 9/25?
<b>PT:</b> I was out in the garage with my gun. 
<b>DR:</b> That was before the last session?
<b>PT:</b> I was trying to, no, it was after. 
<b>DR:</b> After. Why do.
<b>PT:</b> What I'd done to my daughter and what I found out she was staying in her car at the hospital so she could see her child, and I had no answers. I could not renege on what I had done, because she's 23 years old and she's been this way her whole life. And I was trying to figure out a way to commit suicide.
<b>DR:</b> What stopped you from doing that?
<b>PT:</b> My wife caught me in the garage.
<b>DR:</b> And where is the gun now?
<b>PT:</b> I have guns everywhere, doc. I have $15,000 worth of guns. I have guns everywhere.
<b>DR:</b> How tall are you now?
<b>PT:</b> How tall am I?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> If I stand up straight I've got 5'10".
<b>DR:</b> And your present weight?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, probably about 200, 210.
<b>DR:</b> You have gained or lost any weight in 6 months?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Steady?
<b>PT:</b> Steady. I gained weight when you stuck me on those pills. I went from like a 185 to 200, but that's been a year and a half, and that's just been in my stomach.
<b>DR:</b> At present you are taking Lexapro 20 in the morning, right?
<b>PT:</b> Lexapro, yes.
<b>DR:</b> You take it in the morning or at night?
<b>PT:</b> You told me to take it in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> Right, but what do you do?
<b>PT:</b> I take it in the morning. I take my prescription exactly as prescribed by my doctors. 
<b>DR:</b> And the Seroquel is 500mg at bedtime.
<b>PT:</b> I take it at nighttime.
<b>DR:</b> Five hundred mg?
<b>PT:</b> Five hundred mg at nighttime.
<b>DR:</b> And your Xanax XR.
<b>PT:</b> You put me on a 2mg in the morning and then I don't always take in the evening, but here in the last couple weeks I have. You put me on 2 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon because I was in the afternoon when I was starting to get wore down I was starting to have little panic attacks and uncontrollable, and, and but for the last couple weeks I've took them, and I know I said that I take them exactly as prescribed, but that, let me clarify that. If I don't take it exactly as prescribed it's that I don't take it. Now I do take my Lexapro period. I do take my Seroquel the vast majority of the times. Sometimes I will forget. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And then the Xanax, if I don't feel a need to take that pill I don't take that pill in the afternoon. I always take 1 in the morning, but if I don't feel a need to take that pill in the afternoon -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because I'm on my motorcycle or I'm driving, there's absolutely no need for me to take that pill, then I will not take that pill. So I kind of misled you when I said I take my pills exactly as prescribed by my doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Fine. This is what I absolutely have to do. And that is before you go home today we need to have a talk with your wife and I need an absolute assurance from her that until I clear you will have no access to any guns. This is a temporary restriction. I am not taking away your guns from you. I am trying to do everything in my capacity to keep you alive so that I can stabilize the situation. And I didn't know about this gun issue even yesterday.
<b>PT:</b> I've been honest with you about because of the repercussions of that. The last time I had mentioned that suicide thoughts were going through my head I ended up in a mental health hospital and after about 2 hours of being in that mental health hospital I realized I didn't have a problem. 
<b>DR:</b> Let's put it this way. Whatever major of the problem you have you are seeing 1 person and 1 person only and that's you. I have seen similar situations hundreds of time maybe even thousands of times. And I appreciate your confidence in me. Some of the things I have to do may not be very pleasant for you, but I will absolutely need your cooperation. 
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Let me put it this way. Right this minute I have no plan of hospitalizing you, but 5 minutes from now if things change my decision can change as well. One thing I will not compromise and I will do whatever it takes and that is to keep you alive. Rest everything is negotiable.
<b>PT:</b> I will do exactly as you tell me to do because of the trust I have in you. I'm not going to guarantee you that I won't [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You have.
<b>PT:</b> But you are the Ph.D. in this room and I will do exactly as you tell me to do. But I can't promise it will be without rebuttal.
<b>DR:</b> I am not going to impose anything on you except if I'm concerned about your safety that 1 point there will be no negotiation. I'll do whatever it takes to keep you alive.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to die, doc. I just want to be happy.
<b>DR:</b> I don't want you to die either.
<b>PT:</b> I just want to be happy.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, we have had hospitalization but I have known you for about pretty good 4 years now and you have worked, you have stayed away from drug and alcohol, you have not been hospitalized, you have [INAUDIBLE] person with bipolar disorder. That is remarkable achievement.
<b>PT:</b> Just tolerated it and pray to God.
<b>DR:</b> And you're still on the medicine.
<b>PT:</b> No, because the medicine didn't work. I stayed on your medicine because your medicine worked.
<b>DR:</b> That's what I'm talking about.
<b>PT:</b> And when, and here's where I got screwed up, and I said it a couple of times. The medicine didn't work. Well, the medicine didn't work to my acceptability. But when I quit taking the medicine I got worse. But while I was on the medicine, there was very little relief. The medicine was not the medicine I needed to be on. And, and, and that's just my opinion. The medicine they, Wellbutrin and I've been on Lithium and all this other.
<b>DR:</b> Have you ever been on Depakote?
<b>PT:</b> I'm difficult?
<b>DR:</b> No. Depakote.
<b>PT:</b> Never heard of it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. This is the situation I want to do. As I mentioned, that you stayed well I believe because of Seroquel. But Seroquel is not number 1 mood stabilizer. You are on a decent antidepressant medication. And you are tolerating it and because of this extra stress you're falling apart. 
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> If we use Lithium or any other type of medication on that class, every single one of them has to be started at a very small dose - 
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Let me finish, let me finish, small dose, and then over a period of 3 to 4 weeks we go to that number where we want to be. There's one exception. And exception is Depakote. Depakote can be done that way. That is start on a smaller dose and build up. Or you can start on the start on a whopping big dose and then come down. And I want to use that. I'm going to approach that way because you say that your weight is 200 pounds. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It was down to about, um, close to 90kg or so. I'll be using 1,000mg Depakote twice a day. It's a very high dose. Okay. The reason I'm doing it is if it works by this time next week you will be stable.
<b>PT:</b> What does it do?
<b>DR:</b> I'm coming to that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay. I'm sorry.
<b>DR:</b> And after 5 days I need to do a blood test. But I have to do that, no choice.
<b>PT:</b> That's what I have about Lithium and the drug that you're probably talking about is the repercussions down the road from it.
<b>DR:</b> Let me finish.
<b>PT:</b> I know that it's safe.
<b>DR:</b> No, no, no, I'm using it now Depakote because I do not have any other choice to start on a high dose. But I'm not looking at keeping you on the Depakote for a length of time and get blood work done. It's more like a semi-crisis management mode I'm taking. Five to 6 days from now when you're stable I will start you on a different medicine. And slowly build up on that one. That particular medicine could be Topamax, could be Gabitril or Lamictal. 
<b>PT:</b> One of them.
<b>DR:</b> One of them. None of those three means any blood test. But the Depakote you have to allow me to do your blood test at least 1 time. That might be it the way I'm planing. That might be it. But we might have to do 1 more blood test if the initial numbers come back bad.
<b>PT:</b> Good. The things that because my wife is a nurse and she is familiar in this area is the repercussions from the lithium and I have not done any research on what you just said, but I'm assuming the blood test is to regulate my liver or kidneys so that we're not overdosing them to cause them to shut down.
<b>DR:</b> That's right.
<b>PT:</b> And once again I'm, I'm here to do what you tell me to do and remember I said I'll rebel and then I am extremely concerned about a medicine that has an after effect.
<b>DR:</b> Every single psychiatric medication that we use has side effect.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Side effect. And as I've mentioned, because you're somewhat overweight I'm not going to use Depakote for long term because Depakote can cause weight gain. 
<b>PT:</b> Mean get fatter.
<b>DR:</b> But this is I'm looking at keeping your Depakote maybe a month and then taking it away. But if I had any other agent that I can start on a higher dose that can stabilize you quickly without any blood test I would have done it. But Depakote is only one I can do that. I cannot start on a large dose of Lithium. I cannot start on a large dose of Lamictal or Topamax or anything. And I cannot just start and build when you're suffering now. You cannot tell that you suffer for 3 weeks before I get the medicine to where it can be.
<b>PT:</b> That's Medco, I can't, I deal with Medco, so, uh, what's going on, what's the options? If I use a pharmacy, I have the option to use the pharmacy but I have to pay $100 deductible. My company pushes me towards Medco because it is so much cheaper. That's why they stick the $100 deductible on any other type of pharmacy.
<b>DR:</b> You can use the Medco, I have no problem the way it is, Medco will be asking you to use, um, 90 day supply at a time. I don't like to keep you on 90 days of Depakote.
<b>PT:</b> Now, wait a minute, they're giving me the, the Xanax, they're giving me the Xanax in 1 month. And by the way, I asked, I was getting low so I told [INAUDIBLE] order all those pills you're giving a couple of days ago.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, I'll double check on that. So.
<b>PT:</b> I'm getting pretty low. I waited too long.
<b>DR:</b> Do you need, do you have, um, enough Lexapro at home for, how much time does it take for Medco to give you the medicines? Typically a week, 10days, 2 weeks?
<b>PT:</b> Two weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have 2 weeks of Lexapro?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yknow, if I don't, you got some, Lexapro is my antidepressant. 
<b>DR:</b> Right. Seroquel. Yeah, I got plenty. Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How about Seroquel?
<b>PT:</b> Seroquel is going to be close but that's.
<b>DR:</b> Just keep me posted, I might have some sample I might give you.
<b>PT:</b> Your nurse gave me like 5 boxes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I don't know how many is in those boxes but like the next day Medco sent me my Seroquel so I still have those 5 sample boxes.
<b>DR:</b> How about Xanax?
<b>PT:</b> I have, uh, I have, I have, uh, probably about a week.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> When was those ordered?
<b>DR:</b> I have to check, I don't know. 
<b>PT:</b> They're on my pill bottles out in the truck.
<b>DR:</b> I'm going to give you, so you want to buy locally or you want to wait for Medco for the delivery?
<b>PT:</b> What do you want me to do?
<b>DR:</b> I want you to start [INAUDIBLE] those today, full dose should be now kind of thing. And, um, let me see if I have any samples or not. Let me check. Doubt I'll have sample. [INAUDIBLE]. These papers went, oh, I already signed your [INAUDIBLE] paper.
<b>PT:</b> Good, thank you, doc.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. It came to me yesterday.
<b>PT:</b> Should be some short term. I get paid, I also get paid.
<b>DR:</b> Is your wife working now or she is at home?
<b>PT:</b> She's at work.
<b>DR:</b> What time she get done?
<b>PT:</b> Two-thirty she gets off work. When she gets home it's up to her. She may have an errand to run or.
<b>DR:</b> But we can reach her?
<b>PT:</b> At [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Okay. We will make the phone call before you leave here. You are not going home until I get assurance that all the guns are out of your reach.
<b>PT:</b> She cannot do that. I have to.
<b>DR:</b> Do we have any Depakote. All right. Um, I need that assurance because this is one of those.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but they're in my safe and I'm the only one who has the combination and I will get the safe out. I'll call my son. He's a lieutenant for the [INAUDIBLE] and I'll tell him to come get them. Now it involves my son.
<b>DR:</b> Well, when we are in problem we use family. We don't, okay, thanks bye. Sorry, I don't have any samples. I have to write you a prescription and I want you to start today. Okay?
<b>PT:</b> No problem.
<b>DR:</b> Any questions? So these are the things will happen. You will stay on Lexapro, Seroquel, and the Xanax as they are. I'll write you the prescription and Depakote I want you to start right away.
<b>PT:</b> What, doc, please don't misunderstand me, I'm not, I'm, I have a hard time understanding fair English. What are you calling these pills?
<b>DR:</b> Depakote.
<b>PT:</b> Difficult.
<b>DR:</b> No, D E P A K O T E.
<b>PT:</b> Okay. And what exactly.
<b>DR:</b> Not difficult.
<b>PT:</b> But I'm not making fun of you, doc, I just have a hard.
<b>DR:</b> It's mood stabilizer. What it does is it can enforce your mood in here doesn't let you get too angry or too sad.
<b>PT:</b> Which is bipolar?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> What about the thoughts?
<b>DR:</b> It will.
<b>PT:</b> The thoughts is what drove me here. Here's the deal about work. I work 12 hour shifts and I work in an environment that is close to 120 to 130 decibels, noise level. I wear ear plugs. So we communicate out there, we work so long we have hand signals, we can communicate with hand, so for 12 hours at work I'm basically here. You understand what I'm saying?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And that's what, that's what, that's, work was killing me. 
<b>DR:</b> Let's talk. You're not going back to work for now. We'll talk about it as of when it comes.
<b>PT:</b> I got.
<b>DR:</b> For now, number 1, Lexapro, Seroquel, and the Xanax the way you're taking, it stays that way. 
<b>PT:</b> And it works good but it don't.

<b>PT:</b> Well, I've got to leave to the pharmacy.
