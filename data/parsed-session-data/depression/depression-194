BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So we had our last session on, uh, [DATE], which is about two months, right?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And you are on Lexapro 10 mg in the evening at that time being treated for major depression. And we cut it down to half tablet with the plan that we try to see if you can get by without medications. Now are you still taking half of the Lexapro or you have altogether stopped?
<b>PT:</b> I'm just taking half.
<b>DR:</b> When you reduced from Lexapro 10 mg to Lexapro 5 mg, half tablet, what impact did it have on your mood?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I felt more depressed.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I don't know if it was, I'm sure it was just, yknow, coming off the drug, but I feel, um, a lot better now. I mean, I'm, I don't feel as depressed.
<b>DR:</b> So am I hearing that there was a transition of time when you cut down the dosage you felt depressed, but over period of time that depression is gone?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> So overall do you believe that you need any medications for depression because that's the question we are ultimately addressing?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I would say yes at this time. Still in my life with what all's still going on.
<b>DR:</b> What's going on?
<b>PT:</b> Um, still, yknow, just getting used to, uh, being by myself, new house, and it just, yknow, like you said there's what five stages.
<b>DR:</b> Of loss, because bereavement. Is that from the relationship issue, right?
<b>PT:</b> So there's still some issues there. Um, I think that they get easier day after day after day they get easier.
<b>DR:</b> Because time is the healer. Is she still contacting you these days or she does not? She does?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum, about once a day.
<b>DR:</b> She contacts you every day?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And how do you feel about that?
<b>PT:</b> Um, sometimes I really look forward to her call, but, yknow, and sometimes, um, it just rings a bell real clear how come we're not together anymore. Um, I go home saying thank God I got out of that.
<b>DR:</b> It really sounds like that you are having some ambivalence about this relationship.
<b>PT:</b> Well, it's hard to, I mean, I was with her for six years and now I'm just now by myself.
<b>DR:</b> However way you made that decision that she cannot be my partner anymore and you had your own reasons -
<b>PT:</b> I did. 
<b>DR:</b> Making that degree of decision is more like a divorce -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Making that decision is one of the hardest thing you do. But however way you reach that point that this is my decision, you need to let that healing process take over though. The way it's going on in your case it looks like there was a big one. You got the treatment, there's a scab trying to heal. And you open it again and the scab is gone and the wound is coming up again and it bleeds again and again and again and again. Because if you have to find some peace and if you have to find some happiness in your life you have to accept the loss as a loss and then go on with your life. What you are doing, what she's doing is not my headache, because she's not my patient. What you are doing, your well-being is my headache because you are my patient.
<b>PT:</b> So you're saying that just say no more and don't even talk to her?
<b>DR:</b> Not on a daily basis. Imagine this when husband and wife divorce and if there is no children involved in that, it's relatively easier to find a way and move along. They might not talk for the rest of their life, might not see, once everything's said and done, but if there is I have seen large number of people have children and no matter how the parents divorce, the father remains the father and the mother remains the mother. And most of the cases with the father and mother care for the child may not care for each other, but care for the child and go on with their own happiness. They maintain a friendship, not because they want to be friends, but because that's how they can provide a stable environment for the child. That's a recommendation. They usually don't talk on a daily basis. Only when the child issue comes up, they talk. In your case, number one, that's not an issue. 
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Number two, if you contact every day, even if you have a best friend, forget about your significant other, forget about it, even if you have a very best friend, realistically do you talk to him or her every day?
<b>PT:</b> Probably not.
<b>DR:</b> Then if you say that she is my partner and I talk to her every day, it makes sense, but if she is not my partner. How come there is daily contact?
<b>PT:</b> I really don't have an answer for that. I mean, it kinda just prolonging the, like you say the wound.
<b>DR:</b> Is it helping you?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> It's hurting you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I was not part of the decision when you made the decision that she would be a partner anymore or not.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> My job is you have made a decision, how can I help you to accept the hard reality of life and move on? You are getting stuck, I cannot let that happen.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Then I will not be doing my job. You know what I mean?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I don't want to, um, think I'm making excuses, but if you were involved with somebody would you not want to still talk with them?
<b>DR:</b> If I have decided it's over, if I have decided it's over, no, I would not.
<b>PT:</b> You can just draw that line in the sand and not go across it anymore?
<b>DR:</b> That's right. Is it going to be a piece of cake, no. Will I have some desire to cross that line? You better believe it. But will I cross it, I'll do everything not to cross it.  Simply because, number one, there was a time when I had to make that decision and I made that decision. The line I decided to draw. Once I have drawn the line, if you go back time and again then the very purpose of drawing the line gets defeated. And you are delaying the healing process and in the process you are keeping yourself submerged in a sea of loss and sadness.
<b>PT:</b> I see that. I don't like it, but I understand it.
<b>DR:</b> Who likes it? Nobody likes it. You think this is fun? It is not.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> In an ideal situation we'll never have disagreement and we'll just stick together happily ever after. But that's dream land. That's very different from the real land. That's why we have to think, think, think before we draw the line. But once you draw the line, the best thing you can do is respect that line. You blur that line, you will be swinging between what to do and what not to do.  That was the time before that this issue was stopped.  We had that chance.
<b>PT:</b> I agree with you that it's um -
<b>DR:</b> You cannot stay in the past, ma'am. You need to go on and look forward. She might have been a very significant person in your life but now she is your past. Let's look for the future.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Use the past as a teacher so that whatever mistakes we made we do not do it and whatever the right thing we did we repeat it again. But we cannot live in the past. It can be become very, very painful. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But my vested interest is it will make my job impossible.  Now I have to put another question in front. We have to make a pact either 10 mg of Lexapro or no mg of Lexapro, 5 mg of Lexapro doesn't make any sense. You are risking your life.  The reason to cut down to 5 mg was not to see what it does to the depression, but to prevent any sort of withdrawal.
<b>PT:</b> So.
<b>DR:</b> Either go back to 10 and stay on it or stop it. Your call.
<b>PT:</b> Hm. 
<b>DR:</b> Because what you are doing is you're wasting your money. Clinical data has no support that 5 mg does anything meaningful for an average adult like you.  
<b>PT:</b> For what?
<b>DR:</b> For an average adult like you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay. Um, just finish the rest of the prescription that I've already paid for?
<b>DR:</b> What I will suggest stop it, but don't throw away your supplies.
<b>PT:</b> But don't what?
<b>DR:</b> Throw away your supplies. Hang on to it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> In about, say, ten days to two weeks time we will know for sure that stopping the medicine was the wrong decision or the right decision. Initial a little bit of withdrawal in restlessness, anxiety, that might be there for five, seven days. Don't consider it as a wrong decision. Expect that it will go through the transition. That's why about two weeks from now you should feel that your depression is coming back in a more significant way then we'll need to go back to Lexapro.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But if that doesn't happen, then you can flush it down the toilet.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> Sounds good.
<b>DR:</b> Because your diagnosis is major depression recurrent based on how [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] started, I have to be honest with you, I have a hunch that I will get a phone call from you in the near future, let's go back. I just have a hunch. I love to be wrong, but based on my experience I think if [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was right that your depression is more recurrent, unfortunately I don't have any extra information that I can justify that. But I'm assuming he knew what he was saying when he started treating you.
<b>PT:</b> Doctor who?
<b>DR:</b> You have seen on [DATE] [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And he didn't explain why he said it was a recurrent depression. Recurrent depression we do not have a cure, but I'd like to be wrong and that you don't need any more medication then about three months from now we might have our last session you might not need me anymore.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So the next visit will be three months from now.  [INAUDIBLE] time, if you have any difficulty, call me, okay?  Going somewhere in the summer?
<b>PT:</b> Um, nope. Working on my yard.
<b>DR:</b> Good luck with the kind of rain we have.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, like I said, it's all washed down the street.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you might have to collect it, scoop it up and put it back again.
<b>PT:</b> I've done that a few times.
<b>DR:</b> Enough is enough, right?  
<b>PT:</b> Enough is enough, yes.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] rain again and again. Put the projects for next year.
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm gonna build a retaining wall too.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> To trap it.
<b>DR:</b> Good luck.
<b>PT:</b> We're building a fountain.
<b>DR:</b> Wow, your own design?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I bought a granite rock, had a hole drilled through it and water comes up through it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Thank you for letting me record your session.
<b>PT:</b> You're welcome.
<b>DR:</b> Take care.
<b>PT:</b> I like your bright shirt.
<b>DR:</b> Thank you, ma'am.
<b>PT:</b> I'll see you in three months.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, bye bye.
<b>PT:</b> Bye.
