BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: Poor dog is freezing in the car.
THERAPIST: Poor guy.
CLIENT: What's that?
THERAPIST: Poor guy.
CLIENT: At least I should be getting the money to get him to see the doctor.
THERAPIST: The vet, yeah.
CLIENT: I - um - you know, I sent an e-mail to my dad and my step-mom.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Not in - it didn't include my mom. And, um, laid out - I said, "I don't know if I get to e-mail you, talk to you, or wait 'til you come to town" but basically laid out all of my fiscal woes. And my dad talked to my mom.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: And as much as - I think the only thing she was begrudged about was the (inaudible) ticket. (Chuckled.) But my dad explained how important that was to me. So, um, my dad gave me 1,500 right off the bat to get my car fixed. So hopefully that's enough. [00:01:15]
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: I've got an appointment on Monday to get that done. And (pause) it kind of stinks because I wanted to - I need to go to the registry. I have a title due today, but I just don't feel like it. I don't know if I'm catching a cold or whatever, but I have to go and do it today because Monday I'm gonna be tied up and (inaudible) with the car. Your hometown, Auburn. They are pretty good there.
THERAPIST: Are they?
CLIENT: Yeah. I take my car there once before to get um - my catalytic converter was done; and long story short, I was at 82,000 miles and the warranty was 80,000 miles. [00:02:05]
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: And I had procrastinated and um - I know that's probably shocking to you. Um, but they rolled back the mileage in the computer so I didn't have to spend the $3,000, which was cool because it doesn't matter to them.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: They get paid by the manufacturer no matter what, so. And, um, I drove right from Auburn to get it inspected and didn't realize they had to drive for like 3 or 400 miles.
THERAPIST: Gotcha.
CLIENT: Long story short. (Pause.) But my dad and step-mom are in town.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: My dad actually seems in, um, better shape health-wise than he has in a while. I was worried about him the last time I was down there, but the one thing I told him, I said, you know - we were - they had already been in town a few hours. I said, "You know, you haven't told me one story that you've already told me before." I said, "I don't know if you've changed your diet or something, but you're not as senile as you used to be." (Laughing.) [00:03:27]
THERAPIST: (Laughing.)
CLIENT: But he really wasn't complaining about anything or, you know, just -
THERAPIST: I don't think you mentioned this about Dad. He hadn't seemed good when you were down there?
CLIENT: Yeah. Um, I don't know. He just seemed in a lot of pain; and you know, my step-mom was worried. And you could just -
THERAPIST: What's the matter?
CLIENT: He's got all kinds of - you know, diabetes and back problems, leg problems. He's already had two heart attacks. [00:04:00]
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: Small ones. They were, you know, ones that they could deal with angioplasty.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: And then he had a - I think a triple bypass or is it a - he had, you know, one of the big bypasses. But he had a (inaudible) doctor that was still using a technique where they don't break open the chest, which gives you a shorter -
THERAPIST: Recovery?
CLIENT: - recovery.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So he had that done. And it's funny because, you know, he went to North Carolina because the guy was at Duke. And then shortly after that, the guy moved to Brigham and Women's. So he could have spent his time up north instead.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But so, you know, he's had a lot of issues. There's other stuff going on too probably I don't even know about.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, he's got a, you know, pharmacy on his counter. [00:04:56]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But he just - just looking at him, you can tell he's in better shape.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: But um -
THERAPIST: That must be a big relief.
CLIENT: I don't know. I didn't think about it that much. (Laughing.) Yeah. Because my step-mom (inaudible). But they came into town. Went with Ian to the airport. He was excited about that. Got him a donut at Dunkin' Donuts while we waited. For some reason, you know, I got a coffee roll and I got a - Ian wanted a jelly donut. The guy puts two jelly donuts in the bag. So Ian had one and a half jelly donuts (chuckling).
THERAPIST: (Laughing.) Good for him.
CLIENT: Surprisingly, he didn't eat dinner; but Jess didn't seem too worried about it. She didn't - I don't even think knew about the donuts. But um, you know, there's a couple of instances where Jess was very condescending to me or very - it's like, I'm trying to have a conversation; and Ian is yelling from the other room. So it's like, what tone of voice am I supposed to use when he's in the other room? "Hey, buddy. Having a conversation." You know, I mean, I've got to raise my voice. [00:06:24]
You know, so she comes in and you know, badgers me. I'm surprised my dad nor did my step-mom really hasn't said anything yet because she did - several times, she came in and kind of corrected me or, you know, admonished me in some form. I was getting kind of pissed off at it. (Pause.)
The (inaudible) thing is that as soon as I walked in, Lucille is all the way in the other room. And she just comes trucking along and so - I don't know if she knows what a "daddy" is, but you know, she's taken a liking to me.
THERAPIST: Um-hum. I bet she does. [00:07:06]
CLIENT: And she was very good. Gave her to my dad and to Flo; and you know, didn't cry, wasn't unhappy. You know, she's, you know - and (pause). In fact, her birthday party is tomorrow, which I feel slightly guilty in having been a part of none of the planning or paying for it or anything. But you know, whatever. We're under agreement on the condo.
THERAPIST: Oh, congratulations.
CLIENT: Yeah, so. My dad was thinking the same thing I was thinking of and how am I gonna -
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: - afford where I'm going to live, you know. [00:07:56]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I mean, I don't know. I really don't know, um. (Pause.) Ian once again asked if I could sleep over. And I don't know if it just makes sense for me to, you know, to be a little warmer, to curl up in the basement somehow or sleep on the couch or, you know, at least until my business gets back to a better pace.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: I went to a chamber event for the first time.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: And I already have a lunch out of it, or coffee out of it with a financial planner who works out of (inaudible)Credit Union.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: So that was a good connection. The guy who put on - you know, it gets sponsored. Usually people have it at their business -
THERAPIST: (inaudible.)
CLIENT: - but this guy had it at the actual chamber, which is a brand new space in the Channing Center. And I won a $25 gift card. So if I didn't have it with me. I left it at the office. So that's another lunch on that (inaudible) guy. [00:09:13]
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: And you know, I look at it more as just, you know, this is something I should have been doing all along, just to be a known quantity.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: You know, I just, um - you know, I don't - when people ask you, "Do you know this attorney?" You know, I want to be one of those attorneys that say, "Oh, do you know (inaudible)?" You know, that's how I'll know I don't have to worry about where I'm living or anything like that.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But, you know, I picked up a couple of new clients. One client that I picked up when I was upset last week - there's actually two condo owners that are in arrears. So I'll make a little more money on it. Um, I gotta learn how to really do that though. Um, I got a referral yesterday from - there's a guy who was one of my father-in-law's students; and they became good friends, probably from playing pool or something. So he's older than Jess and I but younger than my father-in-law. [00:10:31]
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: And his wife is a real estate attorney.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And he does, like, union stuff, for like police, you know (inaudible). And it's always just kind of been just a little disappointing to me that he doesn't refer the cops for divorces because they're always getting divorced.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: You know. Um, and you know, Jackie's firm does real estate. But she has an issue where the property is owned by two different trusts, and she already has - say (inaudible) in Manchester.
THERAPIST: (inaudible.)
CLIENT: Yeah. And well, the lady who runs that is a trustee of one of the trusts; and her sister-in-law is the trustee of the other trust. And since she already represents the one, she felt she couldn't represent both. [00:11:25]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So she referred it to me.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And even though that they're rich and it's Mom's (inaudible), I just gave her my normal fee, which is (inaudible) hourly rate. And that's why I - you know, "there might be some title issues," I said, "but if there's nothing too onerous, you know, my 850 will - that's what I charge."
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: "You know, and if it's gonna be more, I'll let you know."
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So (pause). I just - probably could have charged her $1,500 and she wouldn't have batted an eye. But, you know. (Pause.) Of all the things I do wrong, I still have some principles or you know - I don't know if it's principles or whatever, but I do unethical things. That's when it's wrong. Excuse you. So (pause) there's some relief, you know, with the money. But I know it's kind of my last shot, and um (inaudible) and I, the caterer, left the group. [00:12:39]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Did we already talk about this?
THERAPIST: I think you mentioned that the caterer left the group but is still willing to cater the lunch (inaudible).
CLIENT: Yeah. So we decided to switch over to a brown bag lunch.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: Which will bring the cost down.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And um, you know, that - that might keep some people in the group that maybe were thinking about renewing. I don't know. But we're planning this big visitors' day where you got to send out fifty letters inviting people.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Then you've got to call and follow up on the letters, which I don't know if I'll do that. (Chuckle.) So um - um but it's tougher than it sounds to come up with forty names, you know. Ten names is difficult. [00:13:35]
THERAPIST: That's right. Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, because you've got to find the name and then when I do the - I'm sure not everyone does this, but I take the extra step and see if there are already in E&G; or not.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: At least run them through the website.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And there's a new reps website, which I don't know how to use. And so I've got to figure out the search option on that.
THERAPIST: Yep
CLIENT: But, um, (pause) - I don't know. It's just kind of a slow time. I've got a bank closing that's going to happen in March. So that's a good thing.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: And hopefully - this woman that I talked to yesterday, her - the house needs a lot of work and there's a mold issue, and it's a cash buyer. And they were close to resolving it. So hopefully they can, you know, put the deal together; and since it's a cash buyer, they want to do it rather quickly. So that'll - [00:14:39]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: That'll hopefully happen in March; and, you know, I'll be caught up. And it'd be nice if by the end of March, I'm actually a little ahead, you know.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: But I don't know how long the selling of my condo is gonna be, but I'm really sort of dreading what I'm going to do about where to live.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: And I haven't talked to Jess about that yet. She's too worried about where she's going to live, so.
THERAPIST: I agree, yeah. Like two closings a month?
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause.) Well, the one I'm doing with the bank, I'm making a thousand bucks.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: So you know, there are some closings you make a little more money. [00:15:30]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, but yeah, that's roughly two closings a month. And that's about what I'm averaging, you know.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: So, um, it'd be nice -
THERAPIST: (inaudible) a couple more.
CLIENT: Yeah. It'd be nice if I could get some more estate planning out of the networking with the Chamber.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: But you know, here it is, things I should have been doing all along that I'm just starting to do. But getting involved with the Chamber and the Rotary -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - hopefully that will generate some business for me.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know. There's a guy who he gave me his card - but I can't find it - said that he needs to refinance, and you know, I - you know, funny, I was talking to the guy from Savings Bank; and he's a financial planner that's in the bank.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So it's a different company, but they - they're in the - [00:16:28]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: - (inaudible) sort of, you know. And um, the bank refers all their people to. And we were talking, all three of us; and he didn't even ask the Savings Bank guy, you know, for the refinance. But I can't find the card.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: So maybe he's - maybe I can look on the website and shoot him an e-mail.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: I didn't do any work yesterday because I had to lead team with E&G; and then E&G; and then picked up my folks.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So I kind of - I got two titles. I need to go into Andover today to finish those up and get them out the door. One's kind of - the one that's due today, which I mean, it's just a pain in the ass. It's a condo. So there's all these - they keep coming up with all these - changing the rules and regulations and different little resolutions or whatever. So I've got to, you know, get copies of those and write those, you know, down. And so it's just a lot of, you know, monotonous busy work. But, you know, it's 175 bucks. [00:17:55]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So (pause). If I get more, you know - I don't know. The busier I'm going to get, the busier I'm going to get with these titles. So it'll be kind of an added - I think the title work will pick up as the spring picks up, whether I pick up or not, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Claire's sort of through, hopefully, her - she's been showing a lot of people our condo.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: And um, hopefully, she's going to have a decent year. That would make a big difference.
THERAPIST: Yep.
CLIENT: Because those are, you know, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500. Those are -
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: - you know, bigger -
THERAPIST: Bigger deals for you.
CLIENT: So but um, at least shorter term, my anxiety is down a little bit.
THERAPIST: Um-hum, yeah.
CLIENT: So (pause). Still depressed though.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:19:02]
CLIENT: (Pause.) (Sigh) My dad was starting to talk about it last night with my stepsister and brother. They're both slow, special needs, you know. I'm not sure exactly what their (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Your stepsister and brother?
CLIENT: Yeah. She was adopted by Flo.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: And I don't know if she's got Down's Syndrome or what, but you know. But they were talking about how the husband needs, you know, some sort of anti-depressant or some anxiety medications, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Worries about everything. And (pause) I don't know. I'm tired of my meds. It's just such a huge expense for me every month, you know. It's 90, almost 90, $100 in meds. (Pause.) Actually, one of them is only like $4 and change. That might be the nortriptyline because it's so old. [00:20:16]
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: I don't know. (Pause.) It just kind of sucks that if Jess gets busy, I don't really benefit from it other than, you know, her covering my ass.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: You know, just (pause) - my dad asked me about that. I just, you know -
THERAPIST: About?
CLIENT: About us working together.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I was like, well, you know, what she makes, she makes; what I make, I make. You know, she helped me out for this month. But (pause). I don't know. Her - she's just overly worried about what's going to happen with the house. [00:21:06]
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.
CLIENT: And even if we don't get the modification, they're not going to come in and kick her out right away with foreclosure. You know, they've still got to - they've got time on that.
THERAPIST: Has she saved enough - saved up enough to have a shot at a repayment plan?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)?
CLIENT: No, because each month keeps passing by.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: And she's been paying for some stuff, and I'm sure she's paying for summer camp, you know, is a big expense right now.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I don't know what she's doing about that. I'm not involved in any of these real -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - decisions other than her complaining about how expensive it is.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: And but on the Alumni list, everybody's been - that's all they've been talking about are summer camps. "I signed my kid up for this." "I signed my kid up for this." "This is great." "This sucks." You know. And (long pause). I don't know. [00:22:10]
It'd be nice if I just, you know - I could find some other - you know, one other potential is with, you know, with the Bank, I'm on their, um, Advisory Committee. And maybe at the next meeting - I haven't done it yet. I missed the first one. But maybe I could meet with the people that run the bank and find out how I can get some closings, you know.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: And I should go by and see Patricia at Eastern Bank, but it's just such a pain to change bank accounts, you know? It really is. It's just a pain in the ass. And you know, at the bank, people sits - right in the Economy Center there. They're right there, you know, so. [00:23:11]
THERAPIST: (inaudible.)
CLIENT: (Pause.) So I don't know. And I kind of want to wait until we're done with the IRS. And you know, that's gonna be another big piece of - chunk of money every month.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know, it's just (pause) - and every time I at least think that, oh, I made progress, it just feels like, you know, like quicksand. It just - I'm not sinking anymore, but I'm not getting out of it, you know. And (pause) my dad wants me to take the divorce training, the Continuing Legal Education. But I might - you know, where am I gonna get the clients from? [00:24:05]
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: You know, it's like - I don't know. (Pause.) I'm taking a training course in the Housing circuit, which I really have always kind of shied away from the landlord/tenant stuff. You know, I've talked to people and you know, I've done a little bit of it. But you know, really it's just - it's like divorce. It's just, you know, people not happy. But they're doing a training for Lawyer of the Day. You get to - as part of the free training, you have to do four Lawyer of the Days over the next year.
THERAPIST: What's Lawyer of the Day?
CLIENT: It's what I've got to find out. One part, they use the word "mediation." So it might be where you help mediate between a landlord and a tenant. [00:25:10]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But it also may be just giving advice to tenants who, you know, are going into court. So but whatever it is, the training is going to be beneficial. And, um, these are the kind of things that get your name out there a little bit, um, and um will get you some practical experience in landlord/tenant to have - I can, you know, stop shying away from it.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know. And (sigh). (Pause.) So I don't know. There's potential in my business, but I don't know if it - I'm just worried about next - you know, at the end of the summer. [00:26:16]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Where is the business going to be.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Where's E&G; gonna be, you know.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And um -
THERAPIST: Probably you're trying to stay focused on what you can do and the good things that are happening, but there's this kind of undertow, you know, all you have to catch up on and all that could go wrong and things like that.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like the life insurance guy is renewing, and -
THERAPIST: At E&G;?
CLIENT: At E&amp;G.; And he's a really good member, you know. He just does the education enrollment, but he hasn't gotten any business.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And he's considering not renewing. Which we're like his fourth E&G; group, you know.
THERAPIST: Wow. [00:27:05]
CLIENT: And it's like you've got to give the thing time, you know. And hopefully reducing the costs will make a difference. So I don't know. I just feel like I can't give any attention to E&amp;G.; It's just so hard, you know. I'm like a captain on a sinking ship who's just accepted the fate that the ship's going down, you know.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And you know, there's - there are people in the group who are still motivated, which helps. The realtor is really motivated. The woman who does auto body and glass windshields, you know, she's motivated. The Mary Kay lady is motivated. [00:28:07]
You know, business that are still there really are people who want to be there. We've got two people joining, which helps. One guy does like consulting for families, generational consulting for families and their business. I don't know what he does. He's a CFO at some little clothing company. But he wants to start getting out of that and getting into this other business. So he'll join. And I don't know if you've ever heard of ULC, but ULC is one of these multilevel marketing - it started out with the video phone and now they're over ADT, cable, cell phones.
THERAPIST: Okay. [00:28:57]
CLIENT: You know, just a provider of electricity and all that kind of stuff. And we had a guy in the group who did that. But it was very popular among the realtors a few years ago when they were all - they had nothing to do and they were all into ULC.
THERAPIST: Oh, I see.
CLIENT: You throw a multilevel marketing - you know, the idea is you throw a party and get people to join.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And they were all realtors. And like every -
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Every person I talked to who was doing ULC was a realtor.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So I don't know if - the fact that this woman is still doing it or just into it or whatever is a decent sign because, you know, I think that for a lot of people, it was just throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I think this woman is probably a little bit more committed to it, so. [00:29:54]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: The last ULC guy got a real job.
THERAPIST: Got it.
CLIENT: A real job, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (Pause.) So I don't know. (Long pause.) I need to go to the registry and get it over with. I don't feel like I would even want to shower or shave or anything. And if I run into a lawyer, I run into a lawyer. They probably won't even recognize me, so.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: But um, (pause) I don't know. This whole short sale thing is (pause) - it gives me a couple months basically, you know. And I -
THERAPIST: You mean selling your place?
CLIENT: The condo, yeah. I hope it drags out and the guy backs out. I really do, you know. [00:31:02]
THERAPIST: Right. So in that case, you would be able to continue collecting rent from a tenant who has not paid the mortgage on it until it sells? Is that -
CLIENT: Yeah, well, at least until August. I don't know if we go ahead and bring in new tenants in September, you know?
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know, (pause), I don't know if that's - what to do with that. But yeah, my dad is like, you know, "I wish I had, you know, 1,500 bucks to give you every month to pay for your rent." (Pause.) So it's nice that he feels that way.
THERAPIST: Yeah, he wants to help.
CLIENT: You know, he's on Social Security and some disability policies but - the guy - he thought he was working with someone who was very good, and they just found out that they weren't very good with life insurance and disability and all that stuff. [00:32:08]
And (long pause) you know, see what happens with Grandma. I feel like I should be making a trip out to Portland to let her see the baby. But I can't afford that. And Jess is gonna put the kibosh on that, you know. So she'll probably never get to meet (inaudible). She's seen lots of pictures. I sent her all the pictures, but so - you talk to her on the phone, and she sound great, you know. But my mom was worried and my cousins and uncle were all worried. And she's talking about her will to my mom. So she's kind of worried as well I guess. I don't know worried but accepting that she - you know, she's 85. [00:33:23]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, she's up there. So my mom is 65. I don' t know. And my mom, says, "Well, I don't know how long I'm gonna live. My dad, he died in like his 50s" or pretty young. I said, "Mom, if you were gonna get heart disease or if you were gonna get diabetes or you were gonna get all of the problems that he had, you would have gotten it by now."
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: You know, "you got your mom's genes." So (long pause). She's going to be with us for a while. [00:34:10]
I just, you know - I know Jess's parents help out with a lot of stuff. But I just have this feeling that if we got to the repayment plan, that her parents could step up. And I know they've got money put away and you know, they've got decent salaries. They're still working. You know, they're in the 70s; and they're both still working full-time. Jess's mom took a new job, resigned at her old job and is now working for the Community College. You know, it's like, you know, she can't stop.
So you know, I know there's hope there, whether Jess wants to ask for it or not. You know, she's always having me ask my family for money, you know. And she's - (pause). We're gonna need to come up with the offer in compromise with the IRS. I think we need to put 20 percent of it up front. And that's what she's worried about. [00:35:21]
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: And it's just with the modification and the repayment plan and this 20 percent and -
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know.
THERAPIST: It's gonna be a lot to put down.
CLIENT: You know, I just asked my parents for 8, 9 - you know, pretty much $10,000 just for me to get by, you know, for having a couple of bad months. But March isn't going to be anything spectacular, at least the way I look at it, you know. I think if I could (long pause) (sigh).
THERAPIST: Is it hard to think about anything else? Not that there's anything wrong with thinking about all this, but I couldn't imagine. Your mind just sort of chews away at this all the time. Like - [00:36:15]
CLIENT: That's why I -
THERAPIST: Here's what's coming through here. Here's what could come through there. I need this. Where's that gonna come from? Am I gonna get help here? What's gonna happen with this? What's Jess gonna do? Is Jess gonna want to - I - it just sounds - the way you're talking, I could imagine that you're kind of like chewing on this financial stuff all the time, and it's hard to get any kind of a break from it.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, that's why I watch TV at night, I think.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: It kind of gives me a little bit of a - I've been playing poker on the phone with people all over the world. It's actually kind of neat.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So, you know, I think - I try to shut things off, but I wake up in the middle of the night. I wake up in the morning, you know, and the stuff, you know, it's always there. (Long pause.) Even if I were to smoke pot, it's still there, you know. [00:37:19]
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: I'm just - it's exactly like I'm -
THERAPIST: (inaudible.)
CLIENT: - kind of waiting for something to, you know, happen, that it just all falls apart. I don't know. How do I - you know, I'm just getting to the point that I just don't know how to move forward, you know. I just don't know how I'm gonna do it. I think Jess, on the one hand, understands, you know, where I'm at and how bad things are for me (inaudible) wise. But she's so damn fucking worried about where she's going to live with these kids that my problems are nothing, you know. [00:38:14]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: She doesn't want to leave Plymouth.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And a two-bedroom in Plymouth is a good chunk of money these days.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And it's like, you know, the kids are sleeping with her. You know, Ian doesn't sleep in his room. He has a little bed next to hers.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know, why do you need a two-bedroom . Get a big one-bedroom. You know, make a little office or something, you know.
THERAPIST: (inaudible) I should have brought this up in the beginning, but it occurred to me at like - I've got some scheduling conflicts the next couple of Fridays that we should sort out.
CLIENT: As if my life isn't difficult enough.
THERAPIST: (Laughing.)
CLIENT: At least I've figured out the cloud, the iCloud. Did I tell you the problems I had? [00:39:09]
THERAPIST: I think you mentioned - you mentioned it.
CLIENT: I was having - I figured it all out.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: (Pause.) There's all these different calendars. There's a work calendar, the -
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I just unchecked those. So I just have a calendar and the same thing in Outlook. I don't use the Outlook calendar. I just use the iCloud calendar. But now that I'm using it, it's like it's just so worth having bought this phone -
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: - over an Android. I've got a $400 phone bill I've got to deal with. That's another thing I (pause).
THERAPIST: Okay. Let's see. So (pause). I guess what I thought would be the - so the next two Fridays I have conflicts.
CLIENT: Business-related? Family-related?
THERAPIST: (Chuckle.) Conflicts.
CLIENT: Don't make me follow you. You know I drive by your house at like 2:00 in the morning.
THERAPIST: Do you? Yeah? Probably pretty (laughing).
CLIENT: I don't want to lose my parking space. [00:41:17]
THERAPIST: (Laughing.) Let's see. I think next week is probably going to be tough to reschedule. My thought would be that just meet once next week. And then the following week, I can meet early on Thursday or early on Wednesday if either -
CLIENT: You can't do Thursday of next week?
THERAPIST: Next week, I can't do Thursday at the moment. If something changes, if I get a cancellation, I'll let you know.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But otherwise, I'm just completely booked up Wednesday and Thursday.
CLIENT: And what - okay. So let me at least delete these. I don't know how I delete just one. I'll have to do that in Outlook. So let me (pause). So no meeting (inaudible) - what's the date? [00:42:32]
THERAPIST: Next week is the 9<sup>th</sup>.
CLIENT: Okay. And what were you thinking about for -
THERAPIST: The following week, I could do 7:00 on Thursday morning.
CLIENT: Okay. So that would be the 15<sup>th</sup>?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: That works.
THERAPIST: Okay. Good.
CLIENT: You don't know how to -
THERAPIST: Change the (inaudible)?
CLIENT: Yeah. Do you?
THERAPIST: Yeah. You change it, it will ask you if you want to change all of them or just the one?
CLIENT: Oh, okay. So let me do that. Okay. So delete event. Delete this event only? Very good. Okay. And then on - it's a Thursday, the 15<sup>th</sup>.
