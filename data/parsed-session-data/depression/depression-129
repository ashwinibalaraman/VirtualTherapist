BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
MALE SPEAKER: This is the 17th interview, Interview Number 17.
COUNSELOR: And I really don't think he's working, so.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's you and I. I can tell you now I'm weak, um, with a cold and it's really depressing.
MS: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, and I think Murphy is coming down with it now, so I'm going stir crazy, I mean really. Also, I found this letter from a friend of mine who I used to be very, very close to, who I haven't seen in a really long time and it started me thinking about what I would like to write to her, what I'd like to tell her about what I'm doing and what's happening with me. It was really strange because I was very sick (chuckling) and, and I kind of got hysterical and I found I would lie awake and kind of try to figure out what to write to her and I just couldn't think of anything.
COUNSELOR: Like what was your problem?
CLIENT: Um, well, kind of, kind of assessing what I was doing... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and not liking the assessment particularly, at this particular moment, and, um... 
COUNSELOR: Do you mean you weren't doing things that you want to be doing?
CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much, and, um, and that just kind of upset me... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...but like in a very abstract, hysterical way because I was very sick.
COUNSELOR: Is it... 
CLIENT: But now that I'm getting better I'm still kind of upset about what I've done with this summer... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...which doesn't seem to be too much now, I haven't finished writing the papers that I have to do and I haven't been able to get going on, with, in the lab and I don't know if that's me or circumstances having to do with that particular setup, it's kind of a combination I think, and now the people have split from... [inaudible at 0:04:46.8] ...so like that's like, (chuckling) and every time I think about it I kind of shutter a little and go like this...like I just don't want to think about the fact that I never got started.
COUNSELOR: Why not?
CLIENT: Well... 
COUNSELOR: Because it's more stressful on you knowing than you... 
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...haven't?
CLIENT: And it also proves there's nothing I can do about it right now. I mean I can really go crazy, I could. I have a system, the whole time kicking myself but it wouldn't get me anywhere.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So I kind of got to get myself going to finish some of those papers... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...by the end of the summer. And I'm coming into the exact same thing that I felt in the beginning of the summer; I'm really scared shitless trying to write that paper. Um... 
COUNSELOR: Just what are you scared about now, is this about the same things?
CLIENT: Pretty much the same, basically I really don't feel capable of writing, um, the sort of paper I think he wants. [0:05:44.1]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um... 
COUNSELOR: Well what if you're not? What if you aren't capable, really aren't capable of writing those papers?
CLIENT: Well then I'll have to write something which would be...second or third rate... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and I'd very much like to get a decent mark in the course, I mean it's very important to me, um, and it's pretty important for my overall average like... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...type outlook. Um, I mean of course if I can't, I can't, (chuckling) there's nothing I can do to make myself if, if I can only come up to a certain level.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, and I am very worried about it and it makes it much harder for me to start it again, because I wasn't... [overlapping voices at 0:06:32.0]
COUNSELOR: I wasn't like -Yeah, I was asking to more think about why you're so afraid of this eventuality that you weren't even going to write any paper at all or even... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...write an even worse one, I mean? Or to say, well you're so scared that you'll write a bad paper... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...that... 
CLIENT: That's it. [silence from 0:07:04.5 to 0:07:15.0]
COUNSELOR: You're afraid to write any paper because it may be a bad paper?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And not one of them, you said because?
CLIENT: (coughing) I'll have to think about it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it wasn't a feel good and so that's too bad. (both chuckling) But no, I mean address...somehow, it has to do with this thing that, what if you do write a bad paper... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...what then?
CLIENT: I'll feel badly about it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you'll feel bad.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: That would be too bad.
CLIENT: And then I will really feel very, very badly about it and, um, I will go down in my own self esteem or expect to go down in Maltase's (ph) esteem, which I've, like, like I would like to set up a good image of me as far as he is concerned or a good estimate of what or who I am and what I'm worth.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um... 
COUNSELOR: So he would think less of you and if you wrote that bad paper he ought to think less of you... 
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...and so he'll react to it? [0:08:42.6]
CLIENT: Um, [silence from 0:08:43.8 to 0:08:55.2] that's about...all I can come up with, but, uh, not just I would really, I'm really interested in his field and I would like to go, to be able to get to know him and like him to have some sort of estimation of me... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...at least him of having some degree of competence, (big sigh) which means I'm, well I've got to do more than worry about it, just sit down and do the damn paper. But (blowing nose) and I'm probably not going to be able to this weekend because Murphy is probably going to get this call...working, I always get like because I'm so broke right now, I mean like completely, totally broke at the moment because I wasn't able to work at all last week and it's been a zero amount of money. And we're both kind of going stir crazy... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...because he's been taking care of me for like the past week and he hasn't gone out much at all, and I've made zero. Um, and I'm very restless because I'm not quite over this cold but... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...that I'm just really sick of sitting around. And like we were going to go downtown and see a film, it's like but we can't because we don't have any bread. (big sigh) Um, and I can really see my beginning symptoms popping up with him and it's really a bitch of a cold, like it's the worse thing I've ever had and it's lasted longer and [it's been real impossible] (ph) with anything else I've ever had in my life. (coughing) And I don't quite know what to do now, I just got to sit and wait for it to end... (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and it's driving me crazy.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. So this is another thing in being sick and everything is just a lot of being trapped in... [overlapping voices at 0:10:44.3]
CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm really restless and I'm getting all the attention and very snappish.
COUNSELOR: Is there a cure for this cold?
CLIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Or is it in your judgment that this is just the way it is?
CLIENT: Well I went to, uh, the... [inaudible at 0:10:57.7]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...they told me to take aspirin.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, do it.
CLIENT: And when you're nose is running that's a sure... 
COUNSELOR: So that's true.
CLIENT: My nose was running, I couldn't talk and I couldn't believe (ph) because my sore, my throat was so sore they I decided to talk about my nose, how I should breathe, and, um, so it's just one of those viral colds... 
COUNSELOR: Yes.
CLIENT: ...Dr. Johnson says to me that, "If I could cure this I would get the noble prize." At which point I said, "Thanks, I'm going home." (chuckling) Making fun of his statement, so...there's nothing I can do except wait for him again and try to make him eat more than I ate.
COUNSELOR: What do you mean?
CLIENT: I wouldn't eat at all very well. Um, the thing is we've been fighting on and off about my stupid parents again, who have, so I finally gave in and I said, "listen, I'll come and visit you sometime in September", which is basically what I was planning to do all summer anyway. Um... [0:11:51.5]
COUNSELOR: Well did you get in a fight with them even though you were planning on doing it anyway?
CLIENT: Um, well I'd, I'd figured that, and that so what would probably happen where I would have to go and visit them sometime around the end of the summer... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...but that until I made up my mind I wouldn't commit myself, I wouldn't say at the beginning of summer I'll see you and the end of the summer... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...I'll just say well I'll see.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: So finally it looked, you see I was holding out because possibly if Murphy had a job and we had a car sometime that we could go east together.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But he still doesn't have a job and it doesn't look like we're going to have a car and it doesn't look like we're going to be able to go east together. (yawning) So I said, okay, I'll come and see them. Um, so they're going to pay part of my fare or all of my fare, I don't know how much probably part and I'm going to supposedly, they want me to go Labor Day weekend because they have a long weekend, which I think is about as dumb as it gets because it's terrible to travel and then I don't get the fringe benefits of going shopping and getting free things like from their money.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, but I don't know maybe I'll end up going then but, like Murphy is just impossible about it, I mean just he's driving me crazy, um, and not wanting me to go and feeling very resentful that I'm going. Um, and it's difficult enough for me to go there (yawning) without him, having to hassle with him about going, too. Um, but he's kind of like he's, he's setting himself up as the, at an opposite pole from my parents and saying...being with them for a week and that's ridiculous, that's the sort of crap that he pulls on me for that, it's in no way a valid reading of what's happening.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, and I, I'm just very upset by the whole thing because I'm very upset, (big sigh) I mean I don't look forward to seeing my parents at all.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, and we really don't have the money, even if my father does pay for half the fare we just don't have the $34.00 or whatever half the fare is...full round, and it's just a very big emotional hassle where I feel I'm kind of being torn down the center and I'm just furiously mad at both sides... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...for having...put me in this position.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Because I am basically trying to do the right thing about my parents... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and it's a great hassle, it's a great financial inconvenience and I really don't want to do it but I am trying.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: I mean if it's some principle... 
COUNSELOR: So you think it's something you should do?
CLIENT: Yeah, it's something I think I should do, some principle behind my actions towards them. [0:14:51.8]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And, uh, he's just making it more difficult for me and which I've told him.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm, right, yeah.
CLIENT: And he's completely irrational about it and he just me know what he's afraid of, I mean he, rationally he knows that I'm not going to go there and listen to mandates about him and come back and tell him to get out, I mean it's just not going to, to work like that.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: You know it's just this completely irrational thing happening and I don't know how to cope with it at all.
COUNSELOR: So I was going to say, what...what happens to you is kind of like, there he is, he's saying things that like you consider really wrong... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...incorrect and also very difficult for you to handle. And where is your problem with men, I mean is it, can we not ignore him or not shut it off or... 
CLIENT: No, I can't and it just really bothers me.
COUNSELOR: What bothers you?
CLIENT: Um, I guess that he doesn't understand what I'm trying to do and how hard it is for me and now he's making it more difficult. Um, what bothers me is he hates my parents and that he really hates them a lot, violently hates my parents very much so and that I don't hate my parents and that I'm going to take actions based on the fact that I do not hate my parents and he's going to expect me to take actions based on the premise that I do.
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: I don't really... 
COUNSELOR: So he's expect - demanding you to act in a way that you don't believe in... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...really or act out of emotions that you don't have?
CLIENT: Yeah. Um, he's, uh, I can understand why he dislikes them very much and he's justified in disliking, they've been very nasty to him, um, but I still don't think he should hate them the way he does.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I mean that I feel so ambivalently in myself about my parents that this is just another complication which I just, (chuckling) just can't handle, it's just too much.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It doesn't clarify anything for him to feel so strongly about them... 
CLIENT: No, not at all.
COUNSELOR: ...it doesn't push you more over to one side or the other?
CLIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: What's it do for instance?
CLIENT: Um, mostly for me it just, I mean really I just, just feel like I'm standing in the middle and I'm surrounded by these, by two feuding hordes fighting over my head and I just kind of want to club both of them, I mean I'm just split, I mean I just don't want to have anything to do with...why should I be the middle man and I could put them on the phone and they could yell at each other, but it's really [hard to for me] (ph) in between.
COUNSELOR: Right. Yes, why do you keep in between?
CLIENT: Well because I have to, they really the only connection to one another outside of me. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Sure.
CLIENT: I mean they simply have nothing to do with one another and couldn't care less except how they both affect me, so they both try and affect me... [0:17:54.4]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...in whatever way they feel is best for me at the particular time, and, um, then none of it helps me, none of it helps me at all in how I feel and how I have to react to all this, so I'd feel, (yawning) I mean so both of them are being absolutely completely selfish about the whole thing.
COUNSELOR: Well isn't there any possible way of your acting out, if you're the person in the middle and they're not allowing you that... [inaudible at 0:18:23.3] ...was for each other, whatever it is that you are for that focal point intersection?
CLIENT: M-hmmm, no.
COUNSELOR: Do you see how your worries - that you're making it easier for them to do all that, is what I mean? [silence from 0:18:39.1 to 0:18:48.7]
CLIENT: I mean...that I'm not sure, um, not really. Um, there are times when I'm talking to my parents I don't even mention Murphy because it's just not having to do with what I am speaking of at that particular moment and, um, (coughing)...my father will bring him up in a very derogatory way; he'll be just... 
COUNSELOR: And then what do you do?
CLIENT: Um, I usually reprimand my father...for saying what he's saying; usually it's all within the effect of how come he, my father's having shouted out that "he's not supporting you and why doesn't he be a man" and what I usually say is, uh, "three years ago you didn't have a job, how did you feel, why don't you be quiet" and, uh, which shuts him up fairly fast, um... 
COUNSELOR: So you basically defend Murphy to your father?
CLIENT: Yeah, um, and try to get my father to be less, um, clich� about the whole thing. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But the way I think, and Murphy says when he shuts up is then that he doesn't really know, I mean he doesn't want anything but my father just does it, I mean it takes years to get something through to my father... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...which we have in some cases but it's not going to happen over night, um, and Murphy gets very offended, having heard one side of the conversation, and he gets very mad and he gets very hurt. And, um, and I understand how he feels but it pisses me off, I wish he wouldn't sit around and listen if it's going to upset him.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And I try and explain to him that that's the way my father is. I mean he says the same sort of stupid, clich�d, crappy things about me constantly, I mean and it's just the way the man is, it's just that I can't change him... [0:20:59.5]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and then he should not rake himself over the coals every time my father makes a stupid remark; it doesn't bother me... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...why should it bother him? (big sigh) But it does! (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Well why does he stay in the same room with it?
CLIENT: I think he kind of feels that they're going to attack him behind his back and that he has to hear what they say so as best to defend himself or to help me defend him or to, or not to allow me to be swept away by their illogical arguments. (chuckling) Um, he feels they're going to attack him and he's got to be around.
COUNSELOR: Then I gather you don't really, feeling it's true that they're going to attack him and all but it's... 
CLIENT: It's not going to make any difference.
COUNSELOR: [overlapping voices at 0:22:11.4]
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean it's, it's completely irrelevant and has nothing to do with anything. They haven't seen him in a year and they haven't seen me in almost a year and what do they possibly know about the way we interact and what the situation is like in New York and you know... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...what kind of shit is this...they know nothing about the situation, absolutely nothing. Now and what they say about it, about something of which they know nothing has very little interest to me... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and carries zero amount of weight, but, um, for me it's a nuisance value for half an hour I get, I get mad at them, very pissed at them for not having more sense and not being more intelligent and more considerate and less selfish, but...once you hang up the phone as far as I'm concerned they're gone; they're a thousand miles away and they don't bother me.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, but yet he, he doesn't seem to realize that yet.
COUNSELOR: Well they're a thousand miles away... 
CLIENT: (coughing) Right.
COUNSELOR: ...and I guess they just don't bond with him?
CLIENT: Yeah or well he sees that they do, just as long as they bother me, but he hasn't gauged that correctly.
COUNSELOR: He doesn't understand how little they bother you, is that what you mean or that although they affect your life beyond the immediate bothering... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...you're thinking?
CLIENT: Yeah. Well because and when you come down to it they really do not affect my life in any great way at this point, they hassle me... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and they're emotionally trying but they do not affect my life in any way whatsoever.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: You know not even the basic modicum of calling them at any regular intervals at this point I just don't bother. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I don't call and I don't write and if they want to bother me that's fine... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...they can bother me, I'm not looking to be particularly close with them.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So... (big sigh) [0:24:01.4]
COUNSELOR: So the situation is that Murphy hasn't, doesn't realize or doesn't understand when you tell him this he's not convinced... 
CLIENT: Well... 
COUNSELOR: ...is that what it amounts to? He's not convinced that they have no influence on you?
CLIENT: Yeah, he's not convinced.
COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:24:18.9]... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So are you asking for a better way to convince him or what?
CLIENT: I guess I'm looking for a better way to convince him and I also wish I could tell my parents that (chuckling)...they can really [damn it] (ph) affect me, please leave me alone and stop bothering me and making things more difficult for me. Um, I, all I can do I guess is...keep on trying to explain to him exactly what's coming off and, uh, I think our basic, our basic problem is that both of us would like them to like him, so I'm as well just very cross with them but I would like to stay... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...close with them if they were not so impossible.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, and so every time they are nasty it's very difficult for us.
COUNSELOR: Every time they're nasty it's a blow to your hopes... 
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...of which you still haven't given up?
CLIENT: M-hmm. Um, and I think like part of Murphy's problem is because...exactly how I feel towards them or exactly how much influence they do have on me, even though I say they don't have any, because it's obvious that I still feel something for them... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and would like to have some sort of relationship with them.
COUNSELOR: So even though you assure him you aren't really assuring him of the right thing and it's no wonder he doesn't believe you?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Because you're saying they don't affect me... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...and that's patently not true even though in more specific... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...ways that... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...it's true, I think?
CLIENT: And I'm just so completely confused about them though and I just feel such... [overlapping voices at 0:26:42.6]
COUNSELOR: [About your parents and things, yeah.] (ph) Uh, well I think that like Murphy, just before we leave that... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...seems like if that's so and that the reason, well a possible reason that he's not believing you is because you're not really being accurate about, to him about what you feel towards them and he can see that.
CLIENT: Yeah. [0:27:01.1]
COUNSELOR: Um, one thing to do is to be more accurate and be more careful about what it is you say so that it does fit... 
CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: ...and that I mean, and so you aren't contradicting yourself in that way you know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Um, and if that doesn't work I guess there's, that's another problem which might, it sounded before like it was the problem now, which is what you do when someone isn't convinced?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: By the thing that you that you're saying honestly, um... 
CLIENT: I think it's just... 
COUNSELOR: ...just something to think about I mean for you.
CLIENT: Yeah. (big sigh)
COUNSELOR: But you're confused about the other one... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...tonight with... 
CLIENT: I, yeah, I'm still trying to establish just exactly what I do owe them, I mean in what do I feel I am obligated to do for them, to do about them, to do with them.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, and it seems to me that I, for some reason I have agreed to go home, I mean I kind of feel that, um, it's a fair request for me to come home at least once a year.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, I mean if I'm going to try and maintain any sort of relationship with them that at least I could come home. But I, (chuckling) thinking about going home is really unpleasant but I just really don't want to go home, I really have nothing to say to them and I have nothing to do out there, and, um, especially if I'm going to be going at a time when I can't even go shopping and...spend some of their nice money, um, then the whole thing is of like no use to me at all and what the hell am I going for...because I can't talk to them about... 
COUNSELOR: Well aren't you going to allay your sense of obligation?
CLIENT: I guess basically, yeah, but I would like to combine it with a couple (chuckling) of other things so I could get something out of it too... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...um, and not just quiet my sense of obligation and my conscience. Um, I used to go home because it was nice to go home and I'd get a lot of emotional reinforcement and affection...just kind of be buoyed up and have the... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...this all daddy (ph), kind of family around me for a few days. Uh, but that was when I could at least and so talk to them truthfully about 90 percent of my life. Um, I don't feel that I can trust them to tell them like what's happening with me in terms of things that I'm worried about and things that I question. I feel that anything that I tell them will be used against me or thrown back in my face in some later conversation to put down Terry. [0:30:25.3]
COUNSELOR: Saying anything in the sense of anything about your emotional life... 
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...it will get used against you?
CLIENT: Yeah, um, and that's troublesome, I mean I don't like to feel that, I also don't want to have to be confronted with that situation of them throwing things back in my face... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and not having put them in situations where they can do that for at least a, for about a year, um, I don't know that they would or not but I don't want to take the chance that they would.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I mean it's much easier to ignore them when they really don't know what they're (chuckling) talking about... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...that if they were to be for a while handling very accurate and very powerful emotional information about me... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...um, which means that I've got a few days of not talking or else talking to them and regretting it.
COUNSELOR: Well it doesn't sound like that to me, it sounds like you can't talk to them about your emotional life... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...which leaves a lot of... 
CLIENT: Facts (ph), but that's what I'm going to be grilled about, my emotional life, I'm going to be grilled about my emotional life. My father is going to want to know how I'm getting along and if I'm happy and the whole spiel about it, and then we're going to go into a whole trip about school and they're going to hassle me about why I haven't done well enough, and my mother is going to, my mother and I are going to have very long talks in which she's going to try and get it, where my head's at and how I am. And this all used to be very comforting... (getting emotional)
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...however, it is not anymore, the prospect is definitely distasteful.
COUNSELOR: So your aim now is to evade those, all those questions?
CLIENT: Right and I've, I'm not...who wants to go home to evade your, to play mental patsy with your parents for four days?
COUNSELOR: I'm sure. Well is it worth it to you? Or else are there ways of changing that so that they don't have that chance?
CLIENT: (big sigh)
COUNSELOR: And I'm granting that you can't go telling them you're emotional life and is it worth it to you to go through this other thing, when you smile and say, "it's fine"?
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: I mean is it?
CLIENT: I don't know where it is or not... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah?
CLIENT: ...I really don't and I'm very, very confused.
COUNSELOR: And if it is are there ways you can make that easier for yourself, in some sense to give you some kind of rewards out of it, like leaving them those openings for questions, telling them the facts, so is there? 0:33:29.5]
CLIENT: You know I was thinking usually what I fall back on to talk to them about are things that have happened right in various classes. And the last time I saw them I was involved in the theatre and doing a whole bunch of singing and things. Um, but I really haven't done anything (chuckling) that much this summer to talk about, um, or I don't have anything particularly much to say to anybody at this particular point, much less...fabricating interesting anecdotes for my parents.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, at this particular time I'm not excited about anything particularly, I'm rather down and I'm feeling very much like, um, I kind of wasted my summer, um, and I don't want to go home and say that to them. Um, and I don't want to have to go home and pretend that I did all these interesting, fascinating little things, which I may...by the time I go home I may be feeling much better and a lot of this is having just sat around for a week... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and done absolutely nothing. Um... 
COUNSELOR: Why don't you want to lie to them?
CLIENT: Because I'm tired of lying to them and I've been lying to them all my life and they've been lying to each other all of their lives and to me.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. Well don't you think what they can do is to doing a lot of half lying?
CLIENT: Oh, yeah, and I think that's what I've been doing right back.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I mean starting from like a kernel of truth and embellishing it to it more palatable.
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: Well starting from a kernel of truth to make it more palatable...yeah, sure. (chuckling) And I can go back and do that but what's the... 
COUNSELOR: Oh, I'm not talking (ph) about lying. See I think half lying is very dangerous... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...because you don't, I mean forget what you're doing... 
CLIENT: Yeah,.
COUNSELOR: ...inside, it's the worst and it's, um, and you can (ph) feel good about yourself.
CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I mean you work it, one works it so... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...that it's possible to feel good about one's self through great work...working around with which you're very bad (ph) to get into but... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...it's not about worrying or even, I mean it's more just to think about what that would mean than it is a recommendation.
CLIENT: (big sigh) That would be pretty sad. [0:36:30.8]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: That would make me be pretty sad; I would be pretty upset if I spent my whole time and not be doing nothing but lying or if I really were in a position where I had come to the point where my trust in them was so non existent and not even be able to tell them a half truth, I mean wow, (chuckling) I'd really be afraid of having to use that.
COUNSELOR: You mean really kind of defiant, just...being very, very split off in that?
CLIENT: Yeah, and that would be it I know. That would depress me even more...that I would be traveling for only - I guess it's I do want to maintain some sort of relationship with them and that's why I'm going through it again... 
COUNSELOR: Oh?
CLIENT: ...the cartwheels that I go through constantly about how I feel about them now and relate to them... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and that's why I'm willing to go home and see them and yet, like nothing, absolutely nothing from my telephone interchanges with them like little (ph) matters that he'd say leads me to feel that, um, that we are going to be particularly close... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...or that we are going to make any sort of good relationship.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. So you aren't going to have but there's nothing to say that you can have any kind of deep relationship that's satisfying... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...primary (ph) emotional kind of thing with them?
CLIENT: M-hmm. What I'd really like to do is go home and say, "Look, I don't trust you. (chuckling) I don't trust you anymore, you've been pretty damn nasty to me." I would let...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: "The way I feel about the situation is that you have kicked me in the teeth and I don't trust you anymore and let's not go through the various merry-go-rounds, let's, let's talk about that situation, are you trustworthy?" You know.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: "What, what do you - how do you feel around me? What are your positions? What do you intend to do?"
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um... 
COUNSELOR: Well what about doing that?
CLIENT: I don't know whether we could or not.
COUNSELOR: You don't know whether they could - you don't know whether you could really do that or you don't know whether they could?
CLIENT: I don't believe I could and I don't know what they would do.
COUNSELOR: You don't know if they have the capacity to, you mean?
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: To look to it, to handle it that way. Uh, I, and then...it's been like a year since we had the big hassle, um, or the last time I saw them was Christmas when we had to talk about money; both my mother and I were extremely uncomfortable, I mean like we, what we tried to do was pretend that nothing had happened (chuckling) and kind of...see if we could maintain some sort of closeness and find our original feelings for one another. Uh, and I know we're not used to talking to one another (chuckling) openly like that... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and just laying it on the line, coming out with answers, I mean I'm more used to doing what I'm doing now, which is taking all kinds of anticipatory readings and getting ready to jump into various positions to try and maintain a position with the least hassle. [0:39:56.1]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I don't know I think they would, I think my parents would be extremely uncomfortable and I think my mother would be extremely uncomfortable; if I would say that I don't think she would (big sigh) know what to say at all and I don't think it would've hit her like that.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: You know I call my father saying ridiculous things like, "Have you forgotten you're our daughter? How come you never come home?" (chuckling) You know and all I want to say is, "Have you forgotten you're my father?" (chuckling) "You know why is all I get from you is shit, what is this?"
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But, uh, I just, like...and the person I really have to talk to is my mother and my father is the same as he's always been about 30 degrees off center somewhere of my mother (ph), um, and my mother simply would - at the root of the thing is my mother who will govern exactly what happens... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...how we interrelate.
COUNSELOR: Well are you prepared for them not being able to answer you the way you'd like?
CLIENT: I don't really think there is an answer.
COUNSELOR: Or for that discussion to be, the process of that discussion [not to go that you'd] (ph) want to see, which sounds like you're clear about maybe for them to say whatever the truth is, for them to tell the truth? You know like for there to be... [overlapping voices at 0:41:40.5]
CLIENT: See now I, I don't think that they see the situation the way I see it at all. Um, I think what would happen if I were to say that would be, my father would become hurt and my mother would become outraged, and that's when I really don't know anything about my mother and that when she really gets dangerous and she gets kind of hysterical, at least she did last summer, oh, she becomes outraged. And I really think she would just throw, go into this blind rage that...who was I to say that I didn't trust her and, uh... 
COUNSELOR: And what would happen to you then?
CLIENT: Well getting over another fight. I mean all the things that build... [overlapping voices at 0:42:28.7]
COUNSELOR: What would she say, I mean what would - then what would happen, she'd yell at you, what would happen to you?
CLIENT: Um, I would probably retreat the way I did last summer...or else I would be very calm and I would try and explain what I was telling them.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. [0:42:48.8]
CLIENT: Uh, (sighing) no, I don't, I don't think we would really achieve any communication on it, and then I just think that she would be very hurt and very outraged and that she would just...be kind of hysterical, which in turn would upset me to the point of my being hysterical and we wouldn't get anywhere.
COUNSELOR: And what would happen then, would you then say to yourself, "well I really tried to settle things" would you have the capacity? And then like if they don't would that be like a final meeting of it and would you get fucked about it?
CLIENT: I think I would get fucked up about it. Uh, I think I, in my feelings it would be kind of a rehash of the last summer that we still haven't that bolus (ph), that very close underneath the surface is the, the original reaction to one another that we had last summer, which I, which was just both of us were kind of extremely hurt and outraged (chuckling) and both of us extremely hysterical and completely unable to communicate with each other, um, about this one thing or we could, like it's a crab (ph) that we just, it's like a circle... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...but we just kind of meet, except on that one point we just don't get together about it and it's, and it's the most basic thing of how we were relating to one another and what we expect from one another.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And...very much what my mother expects from me and how much she's willing to admit she expects and how much she's willing to admit...all this says I don't even know whether she's aware of them herself, I mean they're all judgments I make about the way she thinks, and I guess that's why I'm afraid (chuckling) to bring any of this up because it's all stemming around my mother and I don't know whether...I feel there are certain things about her, I feel there are certain emotional patterns that she's, she's acting upon and I think they're various feelings and I don't know whether she's made, whether this is the true meaning but I have a really good feeling that in a lot of ways it really is.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And if I feel it's the true meaning, has she come to the same realizations and is she willing to deal with them?
COUNSELOR: Though (ph) those are separate?
CLIENT: Of course, yeah. 
COUNSELOR: So that, and she might have come to those realizations and not be willing to do anything about them... 
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...right? And that is not one thing?
CLIENT: Well this may be a large part of...if I were to bring up these questions and it's if...she can take this, this would be very difficult for her to handle... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and in a lot of ways emotionally presumptuous of me.
COUNSELOR: What do you mean emotionally presumptuous of you?
CLIENT: Well because (big sigh) I'm still their daughter, I mean she, at least she must see it that way in terms of, to some degree a hierarchical structure, uh, the relationship rather. [0:45:56.0]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And I of all people should not be yet (ph) demanding that she handle certain things about herself that she just may not want... 
COUNSELOR: Want (ph).
CLIENT: ...to handle and be able to handle, particularly... 
COUNSELOR: And what kind of, is that kind of hierarchical thing is a good arrangement? I see that like that part of that I agree with what you said, she would be probably shocked and scared a lot.
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: But should she be? Should she... 
CLIENT: Well I don't see what she should react at. [overlapping voices at 0:46:29.1]
COUNSELOR: I don't think that she should.
CLIENT: Um, see I really don't know whether she will or she won't.
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: Um... 
COUNSELOR: And you won't be able to know that.
CLIENT: No. (chuckling) No. Now there's no way I can second guess that. [Ask me again?] (ph) Um, I don't think she should be.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, I think it would be difficult, I mean and it seems to be, it's very hard to have your child...make some extremely perceptive remarks about your basic personality but that, that it does seem like I can see where that would be an unsettling experience.
COUNSELOR: Good (ph).
CLIENT: Um, just by nature having given birth to something 20 years ago... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...where, where you still have all kinds of connections with it, your child is still your child...in terms of somebody younger or somebody not quite as smart. Um, and that's the ultimate kind of growth process when you child can turn around and say various stupid (chuckling) things about you that kind of stop you in your tracks and the point where you have to realize this person has really grown up and is no longer my child as such. Um, my mother's been going through that process for a long time of realizing that I'm not longer really under her control in any way.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, what I'd, what I'd want in telling her these things is to find out what she has to say and to reach some sort of understanding with her. And I guess what I'm frightened of is that it, that it will, I mean not facilitate any sort of communication, it will fucking blow us apart completely again.
COUNSELOR: But where are you now?
CLIENT: Um, (big sigh) I guess right now, right now we're in a really strange position where there are some things I trust her about and there are some things I don't trust her about.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And there are some things we communicate on and there are some things that we don't talk about.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Always kind as if we're ignoring it all, the whole hassle. I don't know but, yeah. I mean I don't know even, I don't even know if she is aware of the hassle the way it, the way it's set up in my mind...the... [0:49:05.5]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...fact about I don't trust my parents anymore, I don't feel close to them. But she must be, um, but it's pretty obvious that I'm communicating a lot less with them than I used to.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um... 
COUNSELOR: Well she has to be aware of the fact but she doesn't have to be aware of the reasons in the way that you are... 
CLIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: ...and that makes it a pretty different fact.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess what I'm coming to is I would really like to go home and be able to talk to my mother about this whole situation.
COUNSELOR: But are you willing for the different outcomes... 
CLIENT: I don't know.
COUNSELOR: ...and are you willing to face it then?
CLIENT: I really don't know whether I am or not.
COUNSELOR: Oh (ph).
CLIENT: If the outcome is really, really bad it's going to be even worse than it is now.
COUNSELOR: Is it?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Do you mean [after all this?] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah. Because I still, I mean I still have, I, I can't help it but when I think about talking to her about the situation and various ways I read the situation, um, I really deep down inside hope that she will be able to see the situation the way I do, and if she doesn't start out that way then we can discuss it. And always in the past I mean she's been a great help and has been very astute, has help me to understand things or look at things another way so that it's always been a really interesting exchange of opinions and of, uh, perspectives, and that's what I would like it to be now, I'd like it to be enlightening. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And it would just put me into a complete tailspin if it were, if it, if we just didn't connect.
COUNSELOR: Because it's subject to being not what you're hoping for or what... 
CLIENT: [inaudible at 0:51:16.5]... 
COUNSELOR: ...and what would it mean to you if you didn't connect this time... 
CLIENT: Well it... 
COUNSELOR: ...this time?
CLIENT: ...I mean I still maintain the hope that at some future point, um, I still hope, maintain the hope that I can maintain some sort of relationship with my parents on an honest level... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...so that we can communicate and that we and that we can have some sort of strong relationship with some honesty.
COUNSELOR: Well on what level? There's honesty at different levels, with different levels of content...I mean.
CLIENT: I guess I would like to trust her the way I trusted her before she kicked me in the teeth, which is fairly completely.
COUNSELOR: Well who has to change for that to happen? [0:52:15.2]
CLIENT: (big sigh) Both of us do to a certain extent, I mean both of us have got to talk to one another, um, about what caused the whole basic hassle last summer and how she feels about it, and I mean she obviously doesn't know how I feel about it yet... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...um, and I don't really know how she feels about it though. And I don't know, I just don't know what to expect from her about anything anymore, um, where I used to have some sort of feeling about how she would react at least.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, I don't know what's liable to push her over the edge anymore.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: You know and what is going to make her hysterical. Um, and I'm sure she also doesn't know what it is that she and dad might say which might force me to say, "Look, (chuckling) I'm taking the bus tomorrow, I can't stand it anymore, I'm going." You know, which would be an ultimatum type thing, I would just really get pissed... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and just split if they would start playing those sorts of games... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...with me at this point. Um, I just feel very strongly that I can't trust her and that in order to trust I don't, and I don't know that she trusts me anymore... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...either, probably but I haven't thought of that before but, I mean trust me not to hurt her either, because like I, something must have happened, I mean she must have been hurt in some way, I know my father was, but I don't know, I'm pretty sure my mother was. On the other hand if I try and establish communication with her and it completely backfires I won't... 
COUNSELOR: Communication on the level of...
CLIENT: Trust.
COUNSELOR: ...trust, yeah, where, I know, on the level of communication of an emotional relationship?
CLIENT: Right. And it doesn't, and it just backfires again, I mean I'm just going to be completely torn apart, because it took me a year to build up to the point where I'd like to go back and try and resurrect some sort of feeling, try and find some kind of trust for one another.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. Why would you take that to say, "well they, I can't have that kind of relationship with them maybe, maybe forever or at least for the immediate future", which is very heavy, which is a very heavy thing but it's a different conclusion, it's somehow different than just being torn apart by that, like deciding it can't be your goal with them, I mean...work from that? [0:55:26.0]
CLIENT: That might, I think that would smother the wrong parts for me but it's much harder to come to (chuckling) because, um, before this past year I've always had that sort of relationship with my parents... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and we always talked very well and I've then entrusted them a great deal...with exceptions, which are...really in time which are very closely linked to kind of stages of my life or just emotional growth or rebellion type trips... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...um, and I can look back and see them as such, and yet it seems to be intensive emotional good, I mean that's something desirable, that's what I try and get back to.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I can't help it and then I just, that's the way I think of my parents and that's the way I would, I would like our relationship to be in actuality and I, I really work towards it and it's very hard to break myself of that expectation. It's a very deep-rooted expectation... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...something my parents themselves have taught me to expect... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...from a relationship... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...which is the way they set things up. I think, I think my mother worked very hard to establish a sense of trust between me and her... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and...unconsciously set out to, to give me certain things, certain emotional strengths to fall back on in our relationship.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And it's very, and it's...it hasn't been destroyed or they're still looking to, to find it again... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and I think it would be very, very difficult for me to completely squelch that feeling in myself.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. On the other hand if you aren't going to do the little goody things like that could get you back, there's a chance that this, I mean could that talking about this could get you back to that kind of relating, there's a change that it could explicitly make it seem like it will be much more difficult... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...to get back that kind of relating or any chance that it would, that one of the bigger conclusions you'd draw from that would be that kind of relating isn't possible... 
CLIENT: Usual.
COUNSELOR: ...in them.
CLIENT: Um, I don't see... 
COUNSELOR: So you stand to lose or gain a great deal and you seem to be very afraid about, so it appears we're losing it... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...and I don't see what this middle ground you're in now has to recommend it over that.
CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah. Part of it is in, in a way it's very much easier to do what I'm doing now. [0:58:36.4]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, while I kind of want to resurrect this, this close, these close emotional ties with my parents, um, I also on the exact opposite coin (ph) don't want to... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and so it takes a great deal of emotional involvement, it takes a great deal of, of...maintaining that sort of thing that, um, takes a great effort to get it started and it means I have to devote more time and more emotional energy to my parents, and what I hate is all the time I spend worrying about them, (chuckling) um, it might maybe equalize out in the end. I think now at least I can more than [with it] (ph) part of the time.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, it's easier to be apart from them, it's easier to be a separate entity without...just wooing (ph) myself and where I'm at and all that instead of where I could be back home with my parents... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and, um, shit like that. I kind of wonder maybe that this just isn't the, uh, the break that everybody goes through at one point or another or maybe just, you just do really become separate from your parents home, and maybe it is impossible to backtrack over that. Maybe I just never will be as close to them simply because I'm not living with them anymore and only see them once or twice a year and they're living a thousand miles away. Sociological factors... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...growth factors. It seems like you, after a certain age you just can't lie to your parents, except I don't know whether that's true or not. Theoretically I think your parents...if you rely that way on your parents, you rely that way with your parents, it has nothing to do with living with them or not, it has to do with the strength of your emotional ties with them and how they're built and what they are.
COUNSELOR: So like specifically what does that mean to you?
CLIENT: It should be that I think it is possible to maintain a close relationship with your parents without being tied to them physically or materially in any way... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and it's still possible to, for you to have a strong relationship as, as people... 
COUNSELOR: Well... [1:01:36.6]
CLIENT: ...and emotionally reinforcing with people, so much of that having...to put drags on each other.
COUNSELOR: Theoretically you're right and I think it seems to you like it's an empirical question in every case though? Uh, there's nothing I think in the world that, that null-cates (ph) against that, that rule, but doesn't it depend on their capacities and yours and that's changed in circumstances, you think?
CLIENT: Yes, to a degree but, I think it seems to me that that would be one of the most difficult sort of relationships to maintain and, uh, which would be, um, a very strong, um, parent/child relationship without, um, excessive demands on either side. I mean it would just be... 
COUNSELOR: So it would be trust transforming through a parent and child relationship into one of the deep relationships that you have with somebody, with some people, very many people other than your parents?
CLIENT: Uh-huh, right. And it seems to me that in order, that that is very difficult... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...to transform that sort of relationship because you've got 20 years behind of a standard parent/child relationship, with the child demanding and the parent demanding, and that in order to do that you have to be aware, it's like you have to work at it, it seems to me. Um... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah... [overlapping voices] [1:03:38.4]
CLIENT: ...and it seems to me that for a number of years my mother has been working at it... 
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: ...and some of it is there's been an incredible lapse... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and she kicks the bottom out of the thing and then she keeps on coming! I mean I've never thought of it that way but that's what happened damn it!
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, and I would like to maintain with, I would like, I would like to, to keep working on it. I mean I think...I've come to the point where I would like to build that also... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and I don't want to give up...before I've tried... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...I guess.
COUNSELOR: I guess that helped.
CLIENT: Do it I guess then.
COUNSELOR: Do you?
CLIENT: Um, I don't think I do, no, I think I would like to maintain that sort of relationship, I would find it very comforting, I would find it greatly emotionally reassuring and a very different way... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...in say knowing my parents where there three years ago. Um, if I were able to maintain some sort of very close relationship with them I think it would be good for them and I think it would be good for me. And like my father probably can't, cannot, I know, there's no problem, my father cannot maintain that sort of relationship but I think my mother can; and I don't expect it from my father but I do expect it from my mother.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. So are you willing to find out she can't though or couldn't or that there were signs against it at this time, or would you well having to keep it suspended and potential?
CLIENT: I don't know, it's impossible for me to sit here and say. I mean a lot of that depends on how I feel when I go home and when confronted with it all I mean and I haven't seen her in...nine months... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and how we feel now and how we interrelate, and a lot of it will depend on how we feel. Ten o'clock Saturday morning with the first time (ph) to deal and we're setting there talking over coffee the way we always do and we end up how I've interrelated with my sister where she is at and if she's gone to bed so they don't have to worry about it, if we talk to one another it would be open and if we're both feeling particularly like we want to get together for a talk.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And I mean you know that they were either going to communicate one morning over coffee and cheesecake or whatever or else we're not, and if we did that's when we talked to one another. My father falls asleep in front of the TV and my sister goes to bed and my mother and I stay up and we talk like for hours and hours and hours.
COUNSELOR: Well is that the way you want to have this decision be taken... 
CLIENT: (big sight)
COUNSELOR: ...on the basis of this circumstantial thing (ph)? [1:06:31.2]
CLIENT: Well I mean it's not going to be those things that determine it strictly; I mean it really is going to be the way we feel.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, I found that it's easier for us, those circumstantial things make it possible for us to cut through the bullshit I mean. If we are able to just...sit down late at night when we know we're not going to be able to, when we know we're not going to be disturbed, if we're able to, to just have those few minutes by ourselves that, this is the time when my mother and I have communicated most unbelievably (ph) you know.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And if we're likely to get it together it's going to be something like that... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...when we can talk to one another freely without having to worry about somebody walking in and without having, and...there will be the least bullshit between us would be at a time like that.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: You know like it would be absolutely impossible to do if my mother and I didn't have a chance to sit down and talk to each other by ourselves. And it, it will be possible for me to tell like ten minutes into the conversation whether we trust one another or not, I mean how we're relating and what we want from one another, whether we'll be able to talk to one another openly about it though. And I think my mother's going to be very nervous this visit. (chuckling) And it's like when I think about it I don't think she's going to know what to expect from me anymore than I know what to expect from her. It's going to be very strange.
COUNSELOR: Do you have a clearer sense of what you want to do then, that I mean if you are talking about it?
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) Yeah, I do, I really do...I've, I think...enough time has passed; it's now possible for me to go back and see. I guess I want to go back and see where they're at, so they can see where I'm at and see if we can establish any sort of honest and open communication with one another again. I think, I guess that's why I'm going back because I want to know where I stand with them and where they stand with me, and it's impossible to tell that...at this distance.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah, I feel much better (chuckling) about going back now and I really do feel a lot cooler in my head. [1:09:33.4]
COUNSELOR: Do you have a sense of what if it doesn't work and what, how you'll feel and what you'd want, if you wanted to think about doing or...kind of beyond that thing?
CLIENT: I guess what will happen is I'll be very disappointed and I'll be very hurt and I will simply maintain whatever, I mean at that point it will just become my compliance, I mean I, I will not be looking for something from them anymore I don't think. And I, hopefully I'll come to the realization that at this particular time then my relationship with my parents is simply going to be something to make them feel better...if that's all I can get out of it. If I can't get anything out of it at all then that's just that I can't get anything out of it, so, um, I do feel obligated to them as, that's just the way I'm constituted and... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...brought up and I think I should stop fighting that.
COUNSELOR: Good (ph).
CLIENT: Um, and it kind of feels that the responsibility for a lot of these things is mine, simply because I'm younger and more flexible than they are... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...that, um, a lot of these things they do are just kind of emotionally determined by their fears... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and, um, things which I have, things that I really can't influence for them but things which I can influence in me... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...that I'm much more able to meet their demands than they would be to meet mine, that they're in a much more rigid position... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah (ph).
CLIENT: ...and it's kind of up to me more than up to them. And I'll see, like I'll see how that works out, whether I can work it out. You know the main thing is going to be going there, just keeping really cool, keeping really calm and being very reasonable and very rational and sort of not getting upset at my father, it's so easy to do, and just...trying very hard to maintain the lines of communication and keep them open and not let them upset me and not let them ball (ph) the whole thing up. Right, because I can see...where I can just go off and that I'll have to find a way, because I can see, I can hear all the first things my father's going to say.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: When he starts harping on Murphy's haircut, when he starts hassling me about my grades and shit like that I could just blow sky high... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...if I'm on edge and I know that that won't get me anywhere. But I hope I will be calm enough to say a lot of the things I think, such as when he starts hassling me about grades, say what I've been saying all year, which is you know, "Sure I could've done better but I had to support myself; when you work 30 hours a week you've only got so much time and, uh, this is the result...you can't have it both ways. If you expect me to support myself then you'll have to just put up with what comes out." [1:12:58.0]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Which is really the way I feel I mean I'm pretty outraged... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...at...their expecting me to be, (chuckling) to support myself, very angry, and also to be brilliant...and what they're expecting is basically I should work my ass off and not...and just work my ass off at making money and work my ass off at school and just that's it, allow that to be my entire life and I won't... 
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and they aren't satisfied.
COUNSELOR: So all the things that are going to come up, first that you have an immediate reaction to, you also have things to say that... 
CLIENT: M-hmm.
COUNSELOR: ...that are more clearly where you're really at?
CLIENT: M-hmm, yeah.
COUNSELOR: I've got to stop.
CLIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Do you want to meet me next week... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ... at the same time?
CLIENT: (coughing) Well, we'll see.
COUNSELOR: Perhaps. You went to the worse doctor, it didn't help?
CLIENT: Oh, I know he's such a... [inaudible at 1:13:53.1]
COUNSELOR: Don't go to him again.
CLIENT: I couldn't help it, I walked in and they, they sent me to him...what can you say, "I won't go!"
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I finally, I started asking.
CLIENT: What?
COUNSELOR: I said, "Who is on?" I'd say, "Who is on walk-in?" And then they say, "Dr. Johnson." And I say, "I'll take anyone else."
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And they're very understanding in fact.
CLIENT: He's really incredibly...I didn't believe it; I mean I didn't believe he said that to me, I was so mad. I was so mad, he told me nothing about my sore throat, he told me to suck Sucrets and I was so pissed; I couldn't eat and I couldn't talk and I was thinking and after... 
COUNSELOR: But the worst thing is when you go in and you say, "I have a cold." And then he examines you and he says, "Yes, I imagine you're experiencing a cold." (both chuckling)
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: You know, "Infection around the ears and stuffed up feeling and sore throat."
CLIENT: Yeah, that's him alright. (both chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: He's really hideous, I don't believe him. I have finally, I have finally found a doctor that was really good, right, well he, I found him and... [inaudible at 1:14:49.6] ...he left in June... 
COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... 
CLIENT: ...it's just...offends (ph) to me.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: Okay, fine and if - What if, what do you reading Moby Dick for, just... 
COUNSELOR: Well I saw it through a funny (ph) poem and you'd rather write that, which was basically offered but I had a couple of, um, things that reminded me of Moby Dick and so I thought I would read it over... 
CLIENT: Oh.
COUNSELOR: ...and affirm it. I was reading it and it's just, it's so long. I mean I'm kind of half into it where it is.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I don't like him. I don't like him, he has in this first part he has all these crappy, ironic jokes that, (chuckling) you know what I mean, just this... 
CLIENT: I don't remember it.
COUNSELOR: ...so this, his cute humor is turning me off.
CLIENT: I've never been able to get into Melville at all, um, but I...I feel I should read this classic or that...one of those trips but.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm, right. But he is not, the one thing though he really turns a phrase well, just specific little... 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...nice little phrases, so that's keeping me going.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think maybe... 
COUNSELOR: Well I've been checking it again, so I read it in my junior year in high school and checking against my junior year memories and it's keeping me entertained.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's pretty cool, too.
COUNSELOR: Okay, I'll see you... 
CLIENT: Bye.
COUNSELOR: ...at two. [1:16:10.4]
