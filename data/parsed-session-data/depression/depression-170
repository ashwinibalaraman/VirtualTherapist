BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay. How are you?
<b>PT:</b> Good.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT: </b> Well, I’m okay…
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that’s all right now it’s getting [INAUDIBLE].<b> </b> Hold on, let me get us on track.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I saw you [DATE] so 3 months ago. At that point you had been in a reckless state. You couldn’t listen to a negative, you stopped the Wellbutrin, you calmed down some, still with [NAME OTHER] for 7 months, mood was lower, your appetite was good, sleep was okay, self esteem was good, no suicidal thinking, you were getting pleasure, your concentration was fine, your memory was better, getting rare sweats. You had been on the INH for a year, we were wondering whether there was interaction. So my sense was that in the setting of this cycling mood problem you have, you were in an unstable state back in [DATE] and even somewhat depressed and we found, in the past, that the Wellbutrin not only lessened your mood but probably made you more even and stable and so we agreed let’s go back to Wellbutrin see if we can get that back.
<b>PT:</b> We went to 75 mg.
<b>DR:</b> We went to 75, I have here between 75 and 100. You want to just…
<b>PT:</b> I went to 75, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> 75, now the 75 you take is the immediate relief.
<b>PT:</b> That’s right.
<b>DR:</b> So it may peter out later.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
<b>DR:</b> Do you find that it does?
<b>PT:</b> Well, you know I don’t know if I’m getting anything out of it at all really. I’m definitely down to reality.
<b>DR:</b> Before I ask you my question tell me what has happened?
<b>PT:</b> What has happened? I think…
<b>DR:</b> Well, [NAME OTHER] give me the story of your life.
<b>PT:</b> I’m still seeing [NAME OTHER] but not as much. I was spending too much time with her…
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And I’m trying to get some sort of an agreement with my wife.
<b>DR:</b> Not too much means how frequently do you see…?
<b>PT:</b> I see her about once a week or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> So it’s weekly and you sleep over her place or?
<b>PT:</b> No, I try not to I go home every night.
<b>DR:</b> And how’s your wife handling this?
<b>PT:</b> She’s being better. You know she’s been a lot better. She’s starting to cook meals, she’s starting to clean the house a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> So I’m seeing an improvement in her…
<b>DR:</b> Oh my God.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you know but there are, there is other…So you’ve got more negotiating leverage now?
<b>PT:</b> I do in one hand but on the other hand you know she’s let see what she's done. She’s emptied the bank accounts, she stole my safety deposit key, she’s done everything she can to make herself as, I guess, as secure as she can financially and this is something that [NAME OTHER] that he thought she would do this, you know and I gave her every opportunity to do it too. You know, I mean, I just didn’t stop her from doing it and so now we got to the point…
<b>DR:</b> So they, well, now, it’s almost your payoff.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean you knew the money was there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You knew she had access to it, you assumed she would go get it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And she has.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It’s as if you handed it to her.
<b>PT:</b> It’s as if I handed it to her, but you know what it is is you know and I don’t know if this make any sense to you, you know the things that are important to me, in particular the money, I think my family is more important to me what my kids think…
<b>DR:</b> Of course.
<b>PT:</b> And so now it’s really shown [NAME OTHER] for who she is, she’s just…
<b>DR:</b> They’re aware that she’s done these things?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I’ve told them that she’s done this and it’s only in the last week or so that my eldest, see you know what it is I keep my keys and stuff in the safe at my shop and the only person with the keys to the safe is my eldest daughter. So I asked her initially you know, did she take these things out of my safe and give them to my wife and she said she didn’t, you know, she would never do anything like that.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And so it seems that some how she’s got access to this whether she…
<b>DR:</b> How did she to the safe?
<b>PT:</b> Well, you know I go to sleep at night and I’ve got a set of keys and, and ah.
<b>DR:</b> Then she’d have to come into the city.
<b>PT:</b> Then she’s have to come into the city which she does, I mean she drives around half the night you know nobody know where the hell she goes you know so.
<b>DR:</b> And so she came in, don’t you guys have a gate or stuff on the shop…?
<b>PT:</b> Well, no, no, no. Well, this one is ah, got an apartment above it there and that’s where it is.
<b>DR:</b> So that’s where it is so she can get into that when she knows you’re home.
<b>PT:</b> Yes. So that’s what I think. I mean I’m not 100% sure but sometime this week it’s going to sort of, we’re going to…
<b>DR:</b> Well, you can file a police report.
<b>PT:</b> I could yes, I could but I ain’t gonna go there you know.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sure it’s she who has it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah because she’s told my oldest daughter that she did clean out the safety deposit box, you know so…
<b>DR:</b> What was there?
<b>PT:</b> Cash and, and uh…
<b>DR:</b> So that and the bank account?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah
<b>DR:</b> So nothing that’s not replaceable?
<b>PT:</b> It’s not replaceable as long I’m not done working until I’m [AGE], you know what I mean. I don’t see it as the end of the world somehow. I mean I know when I first found out I thought you know this is really terrible. Then I thought to myself you know this isn’t bad because it, to me I realize that [NAME OTHER] is just about herself, it’s not about…
<b>DR:</b> You could make it up in the money you give her for household expenses.
<b>PT:</b> I could, I could, you know, I could just stop giving it to her. You see she thinks telling the kids for a while I haven’t been giving her any money. I have been giving her money but I haven’t been just leaving tons of money around like I did before. I’ve been restricting the amount of money that I would leave her and…
<b>DR:</b> It seems legitimate that you bring it down to zero now and tell her to use she stole from you…
<b>PT:</b> Well I could do that you know that’s exactly what I could do but…
<b>DR:</b> Without any guilt…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly you know, I don’t know it’s my kids’ mother you know and I don’t want to…
<b>DR:</b> Well, it’s distasteful for you but the battle has begun. I think the divorce battle has already begun whether you want to be in it or not.
<b>PT:</b> Well, you know, maybe I don’t want to be in. I don’t know what I’m going to do, I mean I’m not going to, obviously she’s had advice on what to do and I think, you know…
<b>DR:</b> What do you lose in life you know, you lose, you can lose cash which is one thing, you know which...
<b>PT:</b> You’re right I could replace it, you know. If I lost my family…
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> For treating her badly I would feel a lot worse than you know…
<b>DR:</b> Absolutely.
<b>PT:</b> That’s the way I see.
<b>DR:</b> Absolutely, but I think your kids are, are, are, I met your kids, they’re sharp.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I mean, you know there’s two of them that know about what happened now. My eldest daughter and my youngest daughter. Both of them know because both of them it affects them, both of them have keys to this apartment you know and both of them have interest that it’s going to hurt them what their mother’s doing, so, and you know. I don’t know which way it’s going to go now…
<b>DR:</b> I just don’t think you’ll lose the good will of your children.
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no, no, I don’t know that but you know, but you’re right I don’t feel so guilty about [NAME OTHER] now because it’s sort of like you know this is you know, like we’re just, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right, let’s talk about your moods.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, now, it’s 75% Wellbutrin has sort of kept me sort of plateau mood, I’m neither ecstatically happy or you know…
<b>DR:</b> Your mood is stable.
<b>PT:</b> It’s stable but not…
<b>DR:</b> A bit low.
<b>PT:</b> It’s a bit low, yes, it is.
<b>DR:</b> How’s your appetite?
<b>PT:</b> My appetite is good.
<b>DR:</b> Gaining or losing weight?
<b>PT:</b> I probably gained a little bit because I haven’t been exercising?
<b>DR:</b> Why aren’t you exercising?
<b>PT:</b> Because I think I’m trying to do too much, you know, I’ve been trying you know, since I’ve got out of this goofy stage that I was in I sort of put myself back into working mode and I’ve been working too much.
<b>DR:</b> Are you taking care of things better at the shop?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I’m taking care of my shop better, but I’m not taking care of myself as well and you know my sort of blocked head allergy stuff has come back again which I haven’t had for…
<b>DR:</b> The fogginess.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, the fogginess is back again you know which is you know I don’t know whether that’s…
<b>DR:</b> Well, that’s your depression equivalent.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That’s some of your depression. Do you find that you’re flat that you don’t enjoy things the way you use to?
<b>PT:</b> I’m pretty flat yeah, but I mean I’m not depressed you know it’s sort of like…
<b>DR:</b> You’re not sad.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> But you know the term anhedonic? 
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> It’s from the root hedonism, pleasure…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Right, anhedonic is without pleasure and people, a depressive symptom that some people get they just can’t get the juice they can’t get enough pleasure.
<b>PT:</b> I would say that’s it, I can’t get the juice, you know and that’s about how… 
<b>DR:</b> But not as bad as it was before?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, and then on the other hand I find that it’s this fogginess in my head and I’m having a hard time focusing and…
<b>DR:</b> Do you spin your wheels?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I’m finding that I think it’s giving me a little bit of anxiety and…
<b>DR:</b> What’s giving you anxiety?
<b>PT:</b> This sort of foggy head feeling. Like if you got to focus on doing a lot of things like paying my bills and…
<b>DR:</b> You’re easily distracted.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I’m easily distracted and I...
<b>DR:</b> What are you distracted by?
<b>PT:</b> Anything.
<b>DR:</b> Like a siren or…?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah anything, I’ll find I’ll just you know go on to something else…
<b>DR:</b> Not by personal things? Not by thinking about [NAME OTHER]…?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, I’m not thinking about [NAME OTHER], I’m not getting that remediation stuff
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Stuff going over and over it like I had before…
<b>DR:</b> Like back in [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Before I started the Wellbutrin. I would go over and over…
<b>DR:</b> You mean like years ago?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and I’m not doing that.
<b>DR:</b> How’s your self esteem?
<b>PT:</b> Not bad. I think it’s pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Do you ever feel that life’s not worth living?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And the energy level. Are you dragging some?
<b>PT:</b> I’m dragging a little bit, yeah, but I think if I could get back into the exercise again that would increase that.
<b>DR:</b> The INH treatment is that finished? 
<b>PT:</b> What’s that? Oh yes, that…
<b>DR:</b> The TB. Did that change when you went off that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, no, but I’m still getting sort of sweats from time to time but not as much as I had before and let’s see what else, I’m getting a little bit of short term memory loss like you know where did I put my keys, I’ll just sort of drop them down and…
<b>DR:</b> And that had gotten all better off of the Wellbutrin?
<b>PT:</b> It, yeah it did.
<b>DR:</b> Is that especially bad in the morning of is it bad all day long?
<b>PT:</b> I think it’s bad when you know when my head isn’t clear, you know, I mean I don’t have clear... 
<b>DR:</b> Well, so…
<b>PT:</b> It’s like, I think I’m just running too fast. I’m kind of do too much…
<b>DR:</b> So it’s not necessarily a side affect of the medicine, it’s a, it’s an effect of the depression, right.
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> Most people with, depression is a very cognitive experience, you know people don’t think clearly.
<b>PT:</b> Well that’s it, that’s where I’m at, I’m not thinking clearly.
<b>DR:</b> But you were having some memory problems when you weren’t depressed.
<b>PT:</b> Yes I was.
<b>DR:</b> From the Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b> I’m sorry, I think it was more, I got more before than what I get now, but it’s just like…
<b>DR:</b> Well because, we got two sides of this. Either the Wellbutrin gives you memory problems or the depression gives you memory problems.
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know which it is.
<b>DR:</b> It sounds like now, if you are on the Wellbutrin I would think especially since you’re on the immediate release, you get worse in the morning and then it would get a little better. If it’s depression, it’s just part of the fogginess.
<b>PT:</b> It’s part of the fogginess all day, yeah, it’s something that’s just in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> So, and, and, there’s not this instability. I think we’ve been overplaying your instability. I think you’re mostly depressed.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I don’t think you’re especially unstable.
<b>PT:</b> No, I’m not. What, unstable in what way?
<b>DR:</b> Revving into high states, talking too much, racing thoughts...
<b>PT:</b> No, I’m not, what I find if I try and, if my shop gets very, very busy and I’m trying to do too many things it’s almost like my head just freezes, so it’s…
<b>DR:</b> Right, you’re overloaded.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I’m overloaded. 
<b>DR:</b> That’s depression.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That’s depression. The manic state is high energy, racing thoughts, talking too much and too fast, not needing sleep and a mood that’s either euphoric or very irritable.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You’ve not had that for a long, long time.
<b>PT:</b> No, I haven’t.
<b>DR:</b> But you’ve had pieces of that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, right I have and you know. What it was before when I was on the 150 Wellbutrin, I mean I really felt like towards the end, I mean, I was just running like a lunatic, you know like staying out half the night and…
<b>DR:</b> Well, but you also fell in love.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don’t know that I fell in love particularly.
<b>DR:</b> Well you got into a highly lustful, amorous state.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just got into a state where I thought well you know this is kind of nice you know someone [AGE] to be doing this you know.
<b>DR:</b> Right, but, it’s very you know, it’s hard for me to pathologize that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know that’s what has happened to people throughout their lives when they get into those things. Some people it happens when a business deal is very you know charged up. Other people when they’re in their new love affair or whatever, I don’t know that we should call that part of your, a dysregulated mood and just say you were in a state.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh. It’s was feeling like, I was definitely feeling reckless because I didn’t care about the consequences of my behavior. Now I’m caring about the consequences of my behavior. So that’s…
<b>DR:</b> Right…
<b>PT:</b> A different…
<b>DR:</b> The reckless state, how long did it last? 3 months?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, 3 or 4 months maybe longer than that. 6 months maybe.
<b>DR:</b> And you were on Wellbutrin the whole time.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> But you’ve been on Wellbutrin for 2-3 years.
<b>PT:</b> That’s right, that’s right.
<b>DR:</b> Without anything like that happening.
<b>PT:</b> That’s right but I was in a pretty happy mood all the time and…
<b>DR:</b> You were.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and then on top of that I wasn’t directing my issues at home with [NAME OTHER] because I just didn’t give a crap.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. The happy mood you were in, I suspect that’s your temperament. You’re beneath all of it, kind of a happy guy, you have a good temperament, engaging, pleasant, happy and the fog of depressive illness took that away from you…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> For a number of years and the marital stress. But when we lifted that your moods were not unstably happy, you were just happy the way you should be. It’s like taking the handcuffs off.
<b>PT:</b> All right, well maybe that’s what it was. I think when I wrecked my car at 60 mph on [DEIDENTIFIED], that’s when I realized I was…
<b>DR:</b> But that was in your manic life. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> But not in your stable remission.
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no.
<b>DR:</b> You were in stable remission for years. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You were doing fine and then something flipped and…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was women you know, and I said fuck it you know I don’t really need [NAME OTHER] any more. Some of these young ladies around why don’t I enjoy myself with those.
<b>DR:</b> It was women, it unraveled you. It put you into a state, but if you were really bipolar or much of a cycler, we would have seen that during the two or three years before when you were doing so well. We just would have seen it and it wasn’t there. I’m voting that we don’t have to worry much about cycling.
<b>PT:</b> And so what should I do?
<b>DR:</b> Let’s get you back to where you were for those few years when you were stable and good.
<b>PT:</b> Back on 150?
<b>DR:</b> I think you need a sustained release version of it.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Do you agree? I mean do you find that something dissipates in the early…
<b>PT:</b> Well, I find that when I wake up in the morning, some mornings, I literally wake up feeling depressed. I mean, my wife goes oh shit you know you know and somehow between then the second I take the Wellbutrin, I’m taking a shower and getting out of bed, I feel better.
<b>DR:</b> Well and because you’re on the immediate release, it means it is totally gone by the morning, even the sustained release isn’t much there by the morning but that’s there somewhat. The immediate release is totally gone. I mean that’s pretty much out of your system within 8 hours or so. So, bumping you to the sustained release will improve.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But I think also we got to raise the dose. I think, now did we ever try above 150?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Why don’t we use the 100, did I prescribe the 100 last time?
<b>PT:</b> No, no because all I’ve had is 150 and one 75.
<b>DR:</b> Let me give you the 100s and we’ll do 100 for a week or two. You know, let’s say one week. Things go well on the 100 then we’ll go to 200.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh. Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And 200 is the, the usual dose is 300.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean you’ve always responded at 150 but I think at this point we could use a little extra juice. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Get you exercising, energized, less anhedonic and get you moving forward.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so we’re going to increase of Wellbutrin. You don’t have any at home?
<b>PT:</b> I’ve got 150s and I got some 75s left but not many.
<b>DR:</b> You have 150s of the SR?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good, so then we can do it in three steps.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> We’ll do the 100 for a week, the 150 for a week, then the 200 for a week.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then at that point you’ll decide whether 150 or 200 is the right dose.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, what, how do I know if the 200 isn’t the right dose because I’m? 
<b>DR:</b> Too much juice.
<b>PT:</b> Too much.
<b>DR:</b> Agitated. Let me see if I have any, I’m going to make it even more complicated. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I’m going give you some of the 150 XL. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Have you ever been on XL?
<b>PT:</b> What’s that?
<b>DR:</b> There are two types of sustained release. One is SR and one is XL. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> They differ in a very small way on the level you get through the day, but I think for most people it’s worth trying both to see which one seems to work better.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> If you can’t tell any difference then just use the one that comes in generic SR.
<b>PT:</b> That’s not sustained release though?
<b>DR:</b> It is sustained. But this is like super sustained. If you look at the blood levels it immediately releases up and down sustained is like this and XL sustains it even more.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> For many people it matters. For most people it doesn’t matter. Now the nice thing about the XL, is it comes in 300s. If you need 300 you can take just one pill but it also comes in 150s. So, I’m going change what I just said.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Now you have some of the SRs right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, the 150.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah you have 150 SR.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So what we’ll do it and I’ll write this out. And the SRs come in 100s and 200s.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Take some of these XLs.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, these are 150s, right?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and week one, so it will be all Wellbutrin. And let’s say week one you’ll do 100 SR…
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Week two you’ll do 150 SR and week three you’ll do 150 XL…
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And then try to decide which one just get a small taste of what you like better. We have not figured out which dose we want yet anyway. On week four and after you’ll be on 200 SR. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay, all right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And then and you can call me and say you know I like the XL at 150 you know you’ll have all these options to say which feels best. You’ll probably wind up just on the 200 SR.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But you may say you know 150 XL was the winner or this the winner or let’s go for the 300 XL or SR you know those are also options. Okay, so the prescription I’ll write for you is the 100 SR.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, and I’ll call you back when I need the prescription for the 200s right?
<b>DR:</b> Well no, you just take two of them.
<b>PT:</b> Just take two okay I understand that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah just take two and they come in 200s, but you know...
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah. All right.
<b>DR:</b> That should be, okay. So, Wellbutrin SR 100. I’ll write that you take three a day so you’ll get ninety of them.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, all right.
<b>DR:</b> But you take you know as…
<b>PT:</b> Okay, right, okay.
<b>DR:</b> How’s your son?
<b>PT:</b> He’s, you know he’s making gradual progress. I mean he’s, you know he’s… 
<b>DR:</b> Did he make it to a chair yet?
<b>PT:</b> No., now he’s been told you know that 6 months from now he’s going have to get his act together otherwise he’s going need another place.
<b>DR:</b> He’s out of the door, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Out of the door, yes that
<b>DR:</b> But he’s behaving well?
<b>PT:</b> He’s behaving pretty good. You know it’s what I told him initially about, I said look, I don’t think I can keep you going much longer you know, you really have to get your act together and so…
<b>DR:</b> You said that to him?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just told him that you know I don’t want to you know keep...
