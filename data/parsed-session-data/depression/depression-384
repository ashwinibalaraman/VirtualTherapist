BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: So I've been really anxious that my friends don't want to hang out with me. 
THERAPIST: Oh. 
CLIENT: So a couple of weeks ago—I've been trying to (inaudible at 00:00:35) up with a friend of mine. Maggie used to live down the street but she moved like a half mile away. So not far. I think one of the times we (inaudible at 00:00:52) I cancelled because I was really exhausted. (inaudible at 00:00:56) And then (inaudible) other time and she actually double booked. And I was like, "Ugh. I'm too tired. I have (inaudible at 00:01:03)." Blah, blah, blah. And so she's like, "Okay well when do you want to meet up?" And then I was feeling really depressed and overwhelmed and didn't write back for about two weeks. [0:01:15]
So I just wrote her an e-mail now. Like maybe a week ago saying, "Hey! Let's try it again." And I didn't get a response. Then another friend of mine who lives in Chicago, she sent me an e-mail about two weeks ago about like she's going to mail me something that I bought off her. And that she'd missed seeing me at this event. And blah, blah. And so I just wrote back to her maybe this weekend and I was like, "Yeah. I'm sorry about how I didn't write back. I'm going to be in Chicago this weekend." And I also sent an e-mail to someone else who lives in Chicago. I don't know. [0:02:03]
The lack of responses makes me feel like (pause at 00:02:07] until [00:02:13)—I'm worried that (pause at 00:02:14] until [00:02:22) canceling or not responding back my friends feel like I'm being rude or selfish or inconsiderate. And I'm also worried about being a really depressed friend isn't always fun. So I can (inaudible at 00:02:45) my friends not wanting to do things because I'll just be—I don't know. Sad. And not fun. And I also worry that having problems, reaching out to people when I'm feeling depressed, kind of pushes them away. [0:03:06]
Or that they won't really get why I was having a hard time writing back or responding. I mean I often get—part of the reason—. Like visiting Chicago even though I have approximately (inaudible at 00:03:28) friends there I often get a little worried about trying to plan things. There are so many people. And so many things. And maybe they have more awesome things they want to do or I don't know. Or I'll get confused where people live and I'm like, "Ugh. I didn't mean to drag you across town." Whatever. Whatever. 
So not hearing back from half the Chicago people I wanted to see is making me—I don't know. (inaudible at 00:04:03) part of the trip that's not work. And also I decided to– I just thought recently that leaving late Saturday night would be a good idea because it avoids all the (inaudible at 00:04:18) on Sunday. Which is (inaudible at 00:04:21). [0:04:22]
And I didn't because like no, no, no. You're probably (inaudible at 00:04:25) people on Saturday night. But now I'm regretting it. I don't know. And I'm also worried about my local friends being (pause at 00:04:40] until [00:04:52)—again worried that I'm just too much for my friends to want to deal with. Or hang out with. (pause at 00:05:01] until [00:05:23)
THERAPIST: I guess I feel like you're wanting me to reassure you a bit. Either talk about your friends or about how the worry seems as reflective of depressive thinking as anything else. But yeah. [0:05:47]
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I definitely do want reassurance on that. 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It's just hard to hear it or believe it. I was talking to Ashby about how I was feeling this way. And her response was, "You always feel that way when you go to Chicago. There is always all these people you're not hanging out with." And also Ashby's constant neurosis is that all of her friends don't like her. So I always end up (inaudible at 00:06:29). She's—well not really criticizing. She's like, "If you can tell me that I'm being crazy (inaudible at 00:06:40]– therapist laughing) friends like me, then I get to tell you you're being crazy." Fine, fuck you. [0:06:44]
It's (inaudible at 00:06:49). I'm not really sure what would be the thing that would make me feel less worried about it. I don't know. And I also feel kind of (inaudible at 00:07:08). I feel weird e-mailing or calling my friends and saying, "I feel like you don't like me anymore because you didn't answer my e-mail." Because it's not really that. It's more like I'm feeling depressed and nervous and anxious and I was wondering if you could just—you know. Remind me—I don't even know. Remind me that we're friends or something. (pause at 00:07:36] until [00:07:43) But yeah. I'm having a hard time kind of like letting go enough of that worry to just be like, "All right. I'm going to Chicago this weekend. (inaudible at 00:07:53) week. It will be nice." [0:07:53] (pause until [00:08:18)
THERAPIST: I wonder if some of it also is being excited to go? Or even in here—I don't know. In addition to being nervous, sort of talking about being excited and looking forward to it. And being concerned that that's not okay? Or that you'll be—I don't know—disappointed? Like it's a little dangerous to just be (inaudible)? [0:08:58]
CLIENT: I think I'm definitely worried about either being disappointed or being all excited. And having these ideas and then coming back to work and having—like not being able to talk about them with people. Or not being able to get anywhere with them. 
THERAPIST: Mm. Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It kind of feels like all conversations return to but you can't do that. Or (inaudible at 00:09:37). 
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: And also I mean some of my coworkers that I do get are super frustrated talking about libraries and new technology if they feel like library administration is throwing money at new technology because it'll look good. [0:10:03]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: As opposed to supporting libraries. I mean it's hard because I'm like, "Yes. That's totally happening. And I'd also like to talk about this other part which is not the library being stupid." 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But it's hard to (sighs)—like it's hard to get excited and maintain it. Or get excited and not immediately start feeling like, "Oh but there's always ways in which whatever excitement I have is going to get crashed." (pause at 00:10:53] until [00:11:06) (sighs) I mean I guess (inaudible at 00:11:08) along with getting assigned to support projects that I already know are going to fail is also not really—it's really demoralizing. [0:11:23] 
Especially when I don't get any sensible—a response that makes sense. These twenty things won't work. Well we just need to rethink teaching. And I'm like, "Eh, right." And so I had someone e-mail me about the (inaudible at 00:11:52). She's like, "I couldn't get the (inaudible at 00:11:54) to work. What's the trick?" I was like, "The trick is it never works consistently. So I can sit down with you but I don't have a trick." 
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: And so the follow up was, "Well, oh can you just (inaudible at 00:12:11) then?" "Sure but –." (sighs) I don't know. (pause at 00:12:22] until [00:12:28) It's ugh. (pause at 00:12:28] until [00:12:41) (sighs) It's a very weird—I mean it is sort of a weird use of (inaudible at 00:12:54) but also I'm torn between not wanting anything to do with the various committees and groups and wanting to be on them. Because it sort of—if someone is going to make grand plans about technology in my building I'm the one stuck with it. So I'd like to know what's happening. [0:13:18]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: But being on the committees is often so frustrating. And I feel like I come off as being super negative when I offer critique. Mostly because no one else is going to offer critique. 
THERAPIST: Right. Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:13:44) negative or whatever. I don't know. I've been thinking maybe like—I've been thinking of just trying to talk less during staff meetings because it might just be less frustrating. (pause at 00:14:04] until [00:14:13) But then I end up completely zoned out, checked out for the whole staff meeting. (inaudible at 00:14:19) I'm not—I don't know. [0:14:22]
THERAPIST: Mm. (pause at 00:14:23] until [00:14:54) Mm. (pause at 00:14:55] until [00:15:17) Are you worried about talking about more positive things in here as well at all? [0:15:21]
CLIENT: A little. I guess I don't think about it as much. As something to talk about. 
THERAPIST: Mm. 
CLIENT: Also I feel like (sighs) (inaudible at 00:15:48) but it feels like a lot of things aren't just positive. I feel like there is a lot of, "That was really awesome but –." Or, "That would've been really great except for x,y.z." 
THERAPIST: I see. (pause at 00:16:06] until [00:16:27) So you're more just talking about kind of risks in general whether it's to do with the trip or with speaking up at work? It's kind of a conflict between on one hand wanting to contribute, wanting to be engaged, wanting to know what's going on and on the other hand being ignored, being shot down, being disappointed. [0:16:51]
CLIENT: Yeah. I think what I would like is—I don't know. Like someone to pay attention at work who would actually potentially do something. Like so if I'm worried—I could be doing nothing or anything and he has no idea. And Chet mostly knows what I do I think but—I don't know. It's like half of what he gives me to do is kind of busy work. Or I don't see the point so it's kind of hard to be like jazzed. [0:17:46]
Because I (inaudible at 00:17:47) as good a job on something that I don't think anyone is going to look at. (pause at 00:17:49] until [00:17:58) And also he's so not effective at supporting what I do. I don't—like when I ask him for help. "Can you please talk to this person?" I usually don't get a—like I talked to that person and convinced them x,y,z. (sighs) (pause at 00:18:31] until [00:18:39) Yeah. I mean part of me feels like I could do nothing all day or I could do a lot of things and it's kind of going to be the same. I'm not—working really hard on things doesn't –. I don't get a lot of stuff for that. Especially if it's I.T. related because a, no one really sees it. [0:19:17]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And b, it's sort of like that's a magic computer box. I don't know how you did magic computer things. I'm just like, "Well sort of." But you know. And also (inaudible at 00:19:33) because I fix things quickly etcetera, if anything doesn't work everyone just kind of loses their mind about it. So like this one scanner isn't working. "Oh my God, I think all the scanners are broken!" And I'm just like, "Oh God. Please. Chill." Or someone said this one USB drive wasn't working. "Karen why haven't you fixed that USB drive problem that all the scanners are having?" It was related to the computer's [magic] box. [0:20:19]
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: And so it should always work or not work. And sort of glitch or eh isn't really considered a good response. 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Or if I say—one person telling me that. I can't do anything about that information unless I have a lot more—what were they doing? What did they use? What kind of USB drive? Which I almost never get. So it just feels very frustrating. (pause at 00:20:59] until [00:21:08) I'm also not looking forward to sharing an office with—a small office with Chet. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And all the students. I feel like I'm going to be asked to account for my time more. [0:21:29]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: What were you doing for the last forty-five minutes? 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Which I really hate. (pause at 00:21:37] until [00:22:05) I think along with wanting a manager to pay attention but also—it would be great (inaudible at 00:22:16) network. 
THERAPIST: Sure. 
CLIENT: I thought this trip—like this (inaudible at 00:22:21) nice work thing. 
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: And that really isn't –. [0:22:27]
THERAPIST: Right. Just so I'm clear. I remember the thing with the work trip. And how they said—if I remember right. You could take vacation time or unpaid time or something like that and go. 
CLIENT: Uh-huh.
THERAPIST: I remember you getting pretty (inaudible at 00:22:44) about that. Is that what you're doing?
CLIENT: Yeah. The sort of last stage was –
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:22:49) trip. 
CLIENT: Um yeah. The last thing was I can go if I take either vacation time or work an extra 14 hours (inaudible at 00:23:01) time.
THERAPIST: That's right. Right. 
CLIENT: And so I'm really pissed about that. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I've decided to just lie and say I worked the extra 14 hours because –
THERAPIST: Because Chet's away anyway right?
CLIENT: He's away. And I think it's stupid. 
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: But it makes me feel kind of of two minds about the whole trip. [0:23:23]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Because now I'm sort of like, "Fuck you. I don't even want to go." Out of spite. And then part of me is like no actually I do want to go. And yeah it's not really vacation but the end part is. Friday evening. Saturday. Part of Sunday.
THERAPIST: So is the (inaudible at 00:23:45) thing—I thought it was just like a day. 
CLIENT: Two days. 
THERAPIST: Two days. 
CLIENT: I'm going down Wednesday. 
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: I'm leaving work early.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. It's Thursday at 9 a.m. until Friday at 4:30]. I'm also (inaudible at 00:24:07) that I started thinking about was, will there be any other professionals? Like am I going to be the only one without an degree?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: Will I be the youngest person there? Will I probably be the only person of color there? Is there—and then also kind of (inaudible at 00:24:34) but not. What do I wear? [0:24:36] (pause until [00:24:43) 
Do I try to pretend to look—dress more conservatively in an attempt to kind of be taken more seriously? Will I look older? Or just say, "fuck it", and wear what I would probably (inaudible at 00:24:56)? (pause at 00:24:56] until [00:25:06) 
THERAPIST: One thing—your tone and your (inaudible at 00:25:13)—you sound upbeat in a way. But the content of what you're saying is not. Am I missing—do you (inaudible at 00:25:21) from that? Am I –
CLIENT: I don't feel upbeat about it. 
THERAPIST: Okay. I mean just sort of generally (inaudible at 00:25:29). Something about your tone and the way you're talking isn't conveying the crumminess, the worries and the crumminess that the content of what you're saying is conveying to me? I'm just completely misreading your sort of (inaudible at 00:25:57) and tone? But I—I want to ask you about that. [0:26:08]
CLIENT: I think for lack of a better word I just feel very—the most overwhelming feeling I have is feeling really flat and gray about things. Like a lot of things. 
THERAPIST: Right. I mean I certainly—it's the content of your words. The worries about your friends, feeling crummy, the way you were describing about work, feeling mixed about the trip, feeling worried about—going on the trip and then worried about things to do with being on the trip. (inaudible at 00:26:53) With staying over Saturday night. I mean it's all mixed or worse. (pause at 00:27:00] until [00:27:08) And you feel kind of flat and gray. [0:27:14]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause at 00:27:15] until [00:27:27) Mm. I wonder why I'm getting (inaudible at 00:27:29). I guess it's like a mistake on my part? I don't know. (pause at 00:27:36] until [00:27:47) 
CLIENT: Also my voice is being weird. 
THERAPIST: Mm. 
CLIENT: Yeah I don't feel (inaudible at 00:27:56)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Excited. And I do and I don't. It's (sighs) kind of hard to be excited. Like I'm excited in some ways. I'm looking forward to some things. [0:28:15]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But the other parts of it are I'm worried about the content in the workshop. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I'm worried about all those people I don't know. 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And will I make a good impression? Will I not make a good impression? What kind of impression do I want to make? (pause at 00:28:40] until [00:28:50) Like all of that is very much there when I think about going on the trip. (pause at 00:28:59] until [00:29:47) I talked to my Mom yesterday. 
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I called mostly to just let her know. [0:29:54]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:29:57) trip. And it was kind of a (inaudible at 00:30:06) difficult conversation that I had told her that work was going to send me and then they weren't.
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: So I'm like, "Yes. They're still not sending me but I'm just going to go for networking reasons. And other things." And I didn't want to talk to her very much about like the reasons that—things about the trip that were making me worried or frustrated. 
THERAPIST: Yep. 
CLIENT: Or work. (pause at 00:30:40] until [00:30:49) Just (inaudible at 00:30:50) I'm having this very (inaudible at 00:30:54) kind of weirdly stilted, artificial conversation with Mom. [0:31:00]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: Where I'm not telling her about half of it. 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: I don't know. And I want to (inaudible at 00:31:13) but –.
(pause at 00:31:14] until [00:31:23) 
I (inaudible at 00:31:23) very intense reactions she tends to have with—I don't know. My Mom doesn't really like it when I talk about not liking my job. 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Or things that I find frustrating. My Mom often freaks out that I'm threatening to quit. 
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:31:54) 
CLIENT: And my Dad is usually like, "Well she just (inaudible at 00:32:00) them. And just work four times as hard anyway." (inaudible) [0:32:05]
THERAPIST: Right. (pause at 00:32:08] until [00:32:37) There aren't really many places you can actually go with how you're actually feeling about it. Work in general or the trip in particular. 
CLIENT: Yeah. I think I kind of feel like it would probably be a good idea to—I don't know. At least like talk to some of my friends about feeling worried or anxious. (pause at 00:33:12] until [00:33:21) I'm just scared that they'll say, "Yes. You are (inaudible at 00:33:25)." Even though I'm pretty sure that they're not going to actually say, "You are a terrible, boring friend." Or "Being around you is too much." [0:33:33]
THERAPIST: Pretty confident about that too?
CLIENT: Yeah. When I'm thinking about talking to them I just that's all I'm thinking about. And even though I know (inaudible at 00:33:53) I'm still just like, "But what if it does? Or what if this time they're like, 'Jesus Christ. Chill out.'?" But next time—I don't know. I get stuck in this like every disastrous, bad thing that could happen. And knowing that it's (inaudible at 00:34:13). But I can't get those ideas (inaudible at 00:34:25) head. [0:34:25] (pause until [00:34:50)
THERAPIST: Well today I seem—(inaudible at 00:34:52) idea that there would be something about a more positive interaction that would make nervous. Like (inaudible at 00:35:07) you want it and that makes sense. And at times when you get it it is very reassuring and feels good. Unquestionably. (pause at 00:35:16] until [00:35:28) I guess (inaudible at 00:35:29) you're so much waiting for the shoe to drop. The shoe to drop. [0:35:33]
That—you're worried about seeking reassurance even in places where you're pretty confident you'll find it. (pause at 00:35:49] until [00:35:59) Like it only raising the stakes or only might actually get you to relax a little more and feel a little more like you were safe. Or could expect more of that. Which would then be even more dangerous for the next go round. 
CLIENT: Yeah. I was thinking it's not really a fear of success. [0:36:25]
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: More I guess a fear of –
THERAPIST: Letting your guard down kind of thing?
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause at 00:36:35] until [00:36:44)
CLIENT: Yeah at work I'm not really sure where my guard should be exactly. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Right. 
CLIENT: So I'm reluctant to trust anyone which is not (sighs)—which is really not helpful. 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And very stressful. (pause at 00:37:04] until [00:37:15) I don't know. (pause at 00:37:15] until [00:37:33) I guess at least with my friends—
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (pause at 00:37:35] until [00:37:44)
CLIENT: It's people I'm not as close to where I (inaudible at 00:37:47) 
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. 
CLIENT: I don't see a lot or whatever. They're—what they want in the friendship is kind of just funny or bubbly or thoughtful or whatever. [0:38:17]
And like all the parts are not as much wanted. If that makes sense. (pause at 00:38:29] until [00:38:38)
THERAPIST: We should finish up for now. 
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:38:44) 
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:38:46) [0:38:55] [end of audio]
