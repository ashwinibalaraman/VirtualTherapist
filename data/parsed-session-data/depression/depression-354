BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: Howdy. So the check engine light came on in my car. I got a little excited about that, but I have three closings coming up.
THERAPIST: Well, good.
CLIENT: Which is like I have all this time in the world and I have no closings. I'm going out of town next Thursday and I have a closing tomorrow, which is fine, but they want to close one that has to close—it's an FHA and with FHA you try and close it towards the end of the month because you pay the whole interest for the month and if you don't get the payoff there by the first, it's a whole other month's interest. They want to try and close it Friday, but I have a feeling that it's going to close on Monday, which means while I'm in South Carolina I'm going to have to be getting a wire from my account to Bank of America. It's just like one more pain in the ass. [00:01:15] I don't know if it's something they'll let me do where if I go and maybe set it up ahead of time and then just call them to send it through, whether I've got to beg Jess to do it. That's a pain in the ass. And then the third one they want to schedule on the Thursday that I'm gone, so I've got to pay another lawyer to do it. It's just with a certain lender I'm supposed to get the package back to them before they'll fund the loan, which I won't be able to do until I get back. So they won't get the package until the day of funding, so if there's anything wrong in the package—you know? So I mean I knew it was the end of the month and these loans have nothing to do with the end of the month, but it completely sucks. It's like I should be happy that I've got these loans closing and it's just causing me stress. I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it and I wake up in the morning thinking about it. I had my big tournament this weekend. People told me I played well. There a couple of points I was pretty upset where I just couldn't get open, whoever was coming I just couldn't get outside. I was frustrated a lot of different times during the tournament, but I guess, over all, it went well. We didn't do well. [00:02:51]
THERAPIST: The team?
CLIENT: The team, yeah. We went two and two on the first day and two on the second day. I really didn't play that much on the second day, so I'm not that sore. We had too many guys. It would be like fighting to get on the field. I was looking through some pictures, my folder of pictures, yesterday and I came across an e-mail chain that Jess had with her friend, Erica, and then Jess's what I call Cameron's-an-asshole journal, which I hadn't seen in over a year. I can't remember my reaction the first time to it, but I really kind of had no reaction. [00:04:07] It's basically a lot of just "Cameron just lays around the house. He doesn't engage with the kid. He yells at the kid. I get nothing from him. He doesn't tell me he loves me. He doesn't do anything for me. He doesn't do any work around the house. He just lays on the couch. He comes home. He goes to right to the computer, lays on the couch," all that shit. There's even one point where she said. "He used to never take his phone on dog walks but now he takes his phone and they're much longer walks," and how she's going to check the phone records at the next bill. I took my phone because that's where all the music was—on the phone. The longer dog walk is so I get more exercise and the dog gets more exercise. I guess that's all ancient history now. That's probably why I was indifferent to it. It doesn't seem like I've changed much. [00:05:08] I went over there yesterday. I can't remember and I thought I engaged the kids. Ian was having a play date and I didn't get mad at the kids or yell at the kids. I had forgotten my medicine, so I kind of left after about an hour because if I take the Wellbutrin too late it will keep me up, so I thought it was best. Yeah sleep is all f**ked up anyway. I couldn't go to bed last night and I had won some beer from the Toads for "most improved after attendance: and a four-pack of this one beer . . . 
THERAPIST: Most improved after attendance? Does that mean like most improved going to the get togethers . . . [00:06:10]
CLIENT: The bar, yeah. I guess I'm more social now. I doubled my attendance from last summer. I had one of the beers that  ] (inaudible at 00:06:26) medicines, it's like 12 percent alcohol, so it was only like 11:30, twelve o'clock I drank one of those just so I could go to bed. It worked. I don't know. I'm just miserable, but I keep going. Things I should be glad or happening like these closings, I tell him he's got to close Friday. It's got to close before I leave. "Well, we'll try," but it's not going to happen. It's a brand new file. I know nothing about this lender on the FHA closing, when they're going to get the wire on Friday. [00:07:17]
THERAPIST: The trip's for the [draft?] (inaudible at 00:07:29) 
CLIENT: Yeah. My mom's going to be in South Carolina. My mom's going to be there, going down Thursday to try and see the kids. It sucks. I can't do anything without there being some negative consequence about it. I don't know what the f**k to do about my car. I had been driving horribly anyways. It just wouldn't engage; the gear just revved, and now the f**king check light is on. I don't know if that's the same problem or a different problem or an old problem. I don't have any money to find out. Even with all these closings coming through, it's like the money is out the door. I don't know what to do because I've got one or two closings that will both close in October. I just don't know what to do. I've got every month now the f**king IRS and DOR payment. In September we're supposed to make our estimated payments, for which I've got to come up with $900. I don't know where I'm going to get $900 for that. The psychiatrist called me. I'm seeing her at 11:30 today. [00:09:37]
THERAPIST: Did she say anything about not having called you before?
CLIENT: She just said she was very busy with getting back from vacation. She asked if the other doctor contacted me. I said, "Yeah, she sent a letter," so it seemed like she didn't know I had a letter [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:00) So that will be good. Hopefully it will take less of the [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:18) or whatever. Once that gets straightened out, we'll probably work on switching me to Prozac. (long pause) [00:12:01] You look like you want to say something.
THERAPIST: I'm thinking about what you said. 
CLIENT: My dad is coming to town this weekend. I don't know if he's even going to be able to leave the hotel. He had back surgery and has a walker and has trouble getting around. I don't know if Jess's going to be a pain in the ass. I just need to take the kids to the hotel and let them swim and hang around. [00:13:22] They're still so attached to Jess, but it's like she feeds it. Every little peep out of the kids that's not happy-going she's like, "What's the matter? What's the matter?" A kid can be upset without you having to go over there and, you know . . . (long pause) [00:15:53]
THERAPIST: Rereading Jess's e-mail from however long ago that was, a year and a half . . .
CLIENT: She had a journal that literally was over the course of a couple of years. She just writes something every so often.
THERAPIST: You read what she wrote and you really didn't feel anything reading it? She was complaining about this about you, complaining about that about you, you didn't do this, you didn't do that; and you didn't feel anything. Then it made you think you haven't really gotten any better; nothing has really changed for you. Can you tell me a little more about that? I mean the first part I know literally what you mean when you say you read it and kind of didn't feel anything, but do you have any thoughts about that? [00:17:31]
CLIENT: My only thought is that I've had these issues for such a long time and maybe I'm less angry now, but it's just the medication. There was a thing in there—one was the e-mail chain and one was the journal—and on the e-mail chain they were talking about whether I was that way with everyone or just her and Ian. They made a big deal out of it was just her and Ian, but I used to come home and that's when I would really start getting anxious. There was something about the house that, I couldn't explain it, as soon as I pulled in the driveway my stomach would start turning and, I don't know. I think a part of it is that—she mentions it a little bit—but part of it is her personality. She's just so combative about everything. I think after the years I became so . . . I feel like everything I do is wrong and I'm blamed for everything. I might as well stop trying. [00:19:44]
THERAPIST: I think you felt kind of like a whipped dog. 
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't get upset with people [ ] (inaudible at 00:20:02) I do get upset with people but I hold back. But with her, I freaking lived with her, you know? She confronts me on things. I'm really not interested in rehashing my f**king relationship. I kind of think that's why I was indifferent to the whole thing. I just f**king don't care. Just the realization was there that I've been f**ked up for a long time. I just didn't seem to be getting better. The only difference now is that I'm completely on my own. [00:21:31]
THERAPIST: I would imagine that the world kind of feels like Jess. I mean, not Jess beating up on you, it's life.
CLIENT: Yeah. There's just always something. It's like I can't seem to move forward. I can't get anything resolved. There's no sense of accomplishment in anything, just frustration after frustration. I don't expect life to be perfect, but it's just so f**king grinding. [00:23:10]
THERAPIST: Feel like nothing can just work out going forward or get better. (long pause) [00:24:40] 
CLIENT: My friends are having a barbeque on Saturday and it's something that, in the midst of these f**ked up situations with these closings, would take my mind off of it. My dad's in town, so I can't really go to the barbeque. 
THERAPIST: Have a good time.
CLIENT: These closings are kind of a reminder of how I have no control over my business. It's like I'm totally at the whim of what other people need. [00:26:36]
THERAPIST: That certainly cuts across all of this—your helplessness. You know everything you're describing is about basically shit happening to you that you can't do a damn thing about. 
CLIENT: I just can't let it just bounce off me, though, and f**king live. [ ] (inaudible at 00:27:54) 
THERAPIST: It's a terrible situation to be in when check engine light comes on one day and you absolutely don't know what it means is going to happen next. Is the car going to stop driving or what's going to happen? You're just kind of stuck waiting for the next kick in the head. (long pause) [00:30:49] What do you anticipate about the closing?'
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: How that will go.
CLIENT: I think invariably it will get done, but I want things to go smoothly. I don't want to leave it up to me being in f**king South Carolina trying to get a wire out. I don't want to f**king leave the signing of the documents up to another lawyer. Just keeps me f**king anxious and stressed out that something's going to go wrong, you know? It's too much [with a prayer.] (inaudible at 00:31:52) I just don't know. I'll be doing backflips if the FHA loan closes this Friday. It would make a world of difference; then I wouldn't care so much about having another closing while I'm gone. [00:32:49] 
THERAPIST: What is it?
CLIENT: I don't know. I've got to hope for things to go right. My gut tells me things aren't going to go right because they haven't been going right. At first the first closing is going to close either Friday or Monday. Great. That means it's closing Monday. All of a sudden, while I'm worried about that, I get an e-mail yesterday that this closing is going to happen next Thursday. Great. That's the day I'm not f**king here. [00:34:43] A number of years ago, Jess went out to Vermont. She had a court date and I went in there for her, having never been in a family law court, probate, divorce. I just got my ass handed to me. Never, ever has she wanted to help me with a real estate. Never. She did try one of my cases, but that's it; and that was more I was getting paid. It's just ridiculous that I could never rely on her to just go and have some papers signed. Anybody could f**king do a closing. Sign here, sign here, sign here. Questions? give me a call if there's a question. [00:36:37]
THERAPIST: You're not really asking much.
CLIENT: No. I guess one of the take-aways is that, while I'm going to be seen as the asshole, that I was the problem, that she's not going to take any blame whatever for things going wrong, that it's all me, I'm sure at some point the kid's going to ask when they get old enough, "What happened?" [00:38:21]
THERAPIST: And then, you mean they'll hear her version of it?
CLIENT: I don't know why, but it still bothers me that I was rejected by Barbara. Being around her the whole weekend that's all I could think of.
THERAPIST: What she said or how it hurt or . . . ?
CLIENT: No, not what she said. I think there's probably more to it than that, but just the fact that the answer was "no." (long pause) [00:40:36] It's like I can't even be satisfied with people telling me that I played well in the tournament, because I don't feel like I played well. I was old and too fat and slow.
THERAPIST: You felt really down on yourself. 
CLIENT: I remember the plays I didn't make and the plays I did make. (long pause) [00:44:09]
THERAPIST: What plays did you make?
CLIENT: There were times I dropped the disk, or like when I couldn't get open or got beat.
THERAPIST: So you're in this Friday and a week from today, but then out that Friday?
