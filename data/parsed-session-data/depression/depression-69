BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:


PATIENT: I was just thinking of the fact, I was just thinking of that feeling. 


COUNSELOR: Are you feeling that?


PATIENT: No.


COUNSELOR: Ok, so you're just sort of like remembering? 


PATIENT: Yeah. But I was just thinking that this whole thing has been a lot less agonizing than I thought it was going to be. And does that mean that that's because I haven't gotten inside really and I haven't accomplished anything, or does it mean?


COUNSELOR: What do you think?


PATIENT: I don't know what to think. I don't really trust myself that much. 


COUNSELOR: If you trusted yourself, what would you say? 


PATIENT: I would say, "Wow, it was pretty neat because I was able to talk about these things without getting too upset." And it seemed to go alright. And you seemed to not to be upset. I was answering (inaudible at 0:01:01.9) But maybe, I don't trust myself that much. Maybe not. Maybe I just kept going on a simple level. Or I don't know for my sake, to keep me happy. You are keeping me out (inaudible at 0:01:22.2)


COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:29.4)


PATIENT: That's just, who knows what's going on?


COUNSELOR: It's a game? 


PATIENT: No, it's just the way I feel. Sort of a (quizzical) (ph) well, that's how I feel but is it right?


COUNSELOR: Like looking at how you feel from a big distance. 


PATIENT: Yeah. But not be very critical. It's funny. Sometimes I get really down on myself and very critical of myself. But other times, probably when I should be, I tend to back away from it and don't look at myself. Just accept my misery (inaudible at 0:02:09.4) Can't do anything about it. So, oh well, what can you do about it? 0:02:16.2


COUNSELOR: [What can you do about it?] (ph)


PATIENT: (chuckles) Well, I can come here. You know? And what I can do on my own, I just, I feel a little bit better, than I did before we started. Than I did before we started you know. Because I feel I can ask myself some more questions. I can do myself (inaudible at 0:02:48.8) But still, I mean yesterday I was really, really uncomfortable. I was very uncomfortable and I was really [serious] (ph) depressed. I mean, a couple of things went right. Like I can imagine. I was sort of imaging things like at lunch time. At 1:00, I sort of strolled over to a restaurant. That's where Jenna's working. I'm sort of saying to myself oh, she'll be there. I really feel bad and I just wanted. She was going to come over to work to see me so I wanted to tell her that I just felt shitty and I wanted to go for a walk. So don't come over. So I was telling myself, well, she'll be there eating lunch with David and some other guys and I'll just walk in and just start really getting upset. And I'll go over to her and say, "Well, I'm not going to be in. I'm feeling shitty. I'm going for a walk." And then she's going to say blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. (inaudible at 0:03:49.6) But it turned out that she was just sitting up, reading lines. She, that's what she was doing. She's a backup actress (for the theatre) (ph) and she was just up in the office all alone. (inaudible at 0:04:01.5) We just talked a while about a few odds and ends. And so, on the one hand, I didn't blow up. On the other hand nothing really got resolved within me. But it was pleasant enough. 0:04:14.4


COUNSELOR: I'm curious what you mean when you say nothing got resolved. 


PATIENT: I didn't. Well, what I did was. All of these feelings that were inside me I just sort of blocked them out and sat there and rehearsed some scenes and sort of chatted. We didn't really discuss what was upsetting me. Either with her or with me. Well, like I was really panicky. Not then. Then I was just kind of relaxing. It felt really therapeutic sitting there rehearsing scenes. Sort of numbing my mind. 


COUNSELOR: Keeping busy.


PATIENT: Yeah, right. And feeling comfortable about (inaudible at 0:04:58.8) It's so weird admitting all these jealous feelings. 


COUNSELOR: Are you uncomfortable now? 


PATIENT: It doesn't feel all that uncomfortable. I expected it would feel a lot more uncomfortable. 


COUNSELOR: I guess I get lost when you say weird. I don't know what you mean by that. 


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: Yeah?


PATIENT: Well, ok, ok, hold on, hold on. 


COUNSELOR: Ok. 


PATIENT: It doesn't feel uncomfortable it just feels like a strange thing to do. To just be sitting here nonchalantly talking about all these kinds of feelings which aren't very pleasant to have. I don't think highly of myself for having them. But which I'm able to talk about here without really any discomfort. It seems really a little strange. 


COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:05:46.7)


PATIENT: [As an employee] (ph)


COUNSELOR: Hmm?


PATIENT: As if, you know, boy if I'm talking about things like this I ought to be pretty upset. The fact that I have feelings like that. 


COUNSELOR: Boy, those are awful. You really ought to worry about them. (inaudible at 0:06:05.0)


PATIENT: Talking about it objectively. 


COUNSELOR: Just talking without it getting so upsetting or feeling something. 


PATIENT: Which on the one hand feels very good that I'm able to do that. But on the other hand it makes me think hmmph. 0:06:16.8


COUNSELOR: Something (works) {ph}


PATIENT: Maybe. 


COUNSELOR: Is that what you think? 


PATIENT: No, it's not. I just, I feel good about it. 


COUNSELOR: You're smiling. You want me to smile? 


PATIENT: No, no. It was a smile. 


COUNSELOR: It felt like it. 


PATIENT: But if it. Not, not, I don't know what the word is. I do but I can't think of it. Like there's, I'm not totally sure how much I actually smile.


COUNSELOR: Shhh. Impish or something like that? 


PATIENT: Hmm?


COUNSELOR: Impish? 


PATIENT: Impish? No. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. That isn't the word I was thinking of. 


COUNSELOR: It seems a little play, you seemed a little playful or mischievous. 


PATIENT: Yeah, right. Right. It is back to my feelings of jealousy. So, but like, I can just imagine it would have been much worse and I would have just stalked off and fumed and fretted and felt like jumping in a lake.


COUNSELOR: Because you were fuming and fretting?


PATIENT: Because I was so upset. And feeling upset. 


COUNSELOR: Trying to get away from those feelings somehow? Is that what you're saying? 


PATIENT: [No, what you're saying] (ph)


COUNSELOR: You were saying you were feeling like fuming and fretting and jumping in a lake. And I don't know if you mean. 0:08:07.6


PATIENT: Really desperate. But not. That makes it sound a little too frantic. Just sort of, sort of desperate. Feeling down. Just feeling bad. Feeling hopeless, helpless. No one loves me. No one cares, etc. etc.


COUNSELOR: No one loves you, no one cares? Caring and feeling awful, and I don't feel much.


PATIENT: I don't like you. [I'm just useless.] (ph) Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah


COUNSELOR: I see. 


PATIENT: Yeah. And it just turns in on myself and I just can't get out of it. You know when people. Wow. I was going to say even when people try to help me out. I seem to get away. I'm hopeless. You can't help me.


COUNSELOR: It's too late now. 


PATIENT: Yeah. 


COUNSELOR:(inaudible at 0:09:13.3) 


PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:09:14.2)


COUNSELOR: Yeah but how do you sound?


PATIENT: I just sound like I was silly and that's sort of how it is. It is silly. It just sounded funny. 


COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel funny. [That's why I always laugh too.] I guess. Because if I felt that way. Not want anybody to laugh. I just think I ...


PATIENT: But you're sitting there smiling. So you're not that upset about it. 


COUNSELOR: I know. But I'm, ok. 


PATIENT: I wasn't feeling that good feeling. I was feeling the way he said it. And you said it with a big grin. 0:09:57.4


COUNSELOR: What?


PATIENT: Just sounds funny.


COUNSELOR: What's the eyebrow signal?


PATIENT: That meant anyway. It just sounded funny. I was kinda getting a little depressed there (inaudible at 0:10:16.2)


COUNSELOR: Hmm.


PATIENT: Just thinking about feeling that way. But laughing about them going. (chuckles)


COUNSELOR: Hmm. 


PATIENT: Just thinking of how silly it is. 


COUNSELOR: [Rather than feeling you.] ph 


PATIENT: Yeah. But like it would be good if I could tell myself that.


COUNSELOR: Ho, ho, ho, this, is one hell of a story kind of thing? 


PATIENT: Yeah. 


COUNSELOR: Instead of "Oh my God."


PATIENT: This, is horrible. Really depressing. Woe is me. 


COUNSELOR: I don't like me. Nobody else does either. What in the hell can I do about it? 


PATIENT: I just sort of walk around the halls. Not really wanting anybody to say what's wrong. It's just a contradictory state of affairs. 


COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 


PATIENT: Because I get angry if somebody tries to do anything or says something to me. And if they don't, I'll get angry too. What it comes down to is I have to tell myself something. On that note, (inaudible at 0:11:33.7)


COUNSELOR: Think your feeling like that's a hell of a position to be in. To be fuming at anybody and really mad no matter what they do. Like by the time it gets that desperate for you, you're so angry at people not noticing that you're very upset and desperate. And also...


PATIENT: Don't really want them to notice. 


COUNSELOR: Shallow, noticing in a shallow way that there's something wrong? 0:12:07.3


PATIENT: Maybe. 


COUNSELOR: And also hoping they won't see.


PATIENT: Yeah. First of all, feeling bad about being there and then not wanting them not to see it. Because I kinda want attention. But not wanting them to see it either. So. There's no hope. It's sort of, what I do is I sort of go into my room, into my office there and close the door. Because I don't want people to see that I'm just sort of sitting around moping. But on the other hand. Like Susan works over there. And I'd sort of like her to walk in and comfort me. But that feels no good either because that really feels like running home to Mama again. 


COUNSELOR: Somehow not solving it or something? 


PATIENT: Well, just somehow I should be doing it by myself. And I'd be a lot happier if I could. 


COUNSELOR: Mmm, boy. I bet you really would be if you feel like boy, I can feel that desperate and then shift it some. 


PATIENT: Well when I'm feeling that way, I don't think these things. I can tell myself, like the word it sure would be good if I could do it myself but I don't really mean it.


COUNSELOR: But it has a very distant wistful thing. 


PATIENT: Yeah. I don't really feel it. (overlapping) I just feel who cares? Who cares about me?


COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't care. I'm not hurting. Or it doesn't make any difference to me or anybody else. It's time for us to stop. Two o'clock. 0:14:12.7


PATIENT: All right. See you Monday. 


COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Oh I forgot to put Monday down. Let's see. 


PATIENT: You did that once before.


COUNSELOR: Could be. 


PATIENT: Maybe that's why.


COUNSELOR: That's why what? 


PATIENT: Like this, is only the tenth session.


COUNSELOR: I'll see you.


PATIENT: All right then. Ok. See you. 0:14:43.8
