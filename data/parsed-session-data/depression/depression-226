INTRODUCTION:
The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy. 
This session features Dr. John N. Rosen, who was noted for his work with schizophrenics and was the originator of a unique technique referred to as direct psychoanalysis. He authored several books, including Direct Psychoanalytic Psychiatry (New York: Grune &amp; Stratton, 1962).

THERAPIST'S INTRODUCTION:
April 25th, treating Dr. John Rosen. Chief Therapist. Present are the assistant therapist and this particular session is being recorded to be used as an example of psychotherapy by direct analysis in a series of such recordings to demonstrate different methods of psychotherapy by innovators has been intriguement on and off for about eight months. 
He originally came in with an acute paranoid episode which rapidly subsided and direct analysis was terminated at that point because what we proposed to do was bring about resolution of the psychosis. He remained well for about a year or so and did not return for the prescribed continuing therapy, for the neo-neurosis which followed the resolution of the psychosis. But in panic, he did come back about six months ago saying that he felt upset again, and this time came directly to the institute, the treatment unit for the purpose of being taken care of here.
He has shown very slight improvement with the connivings of his parents, he ran away for a few weeks about a month ago and was brought back without any manifest objection to being brought back. 
BEGIN SESSION:
COUNSELOR: Why are you in a straight jacket?
CLIENT: [Respondent shakes head.]
COUNSELOR: Don't shake your head, answer me. 
CLIENT: I don't know.
COUNSELOR: You don't know why you're in a straight jacket? Did you say that you wanted to kill yourself?
CLIENT: How many months ago was that?
COUNSELOR: I mean, today? Yesterday? When you were standing in the bathroom with a nail file in your hands. What were you doing that for?
CLIENT: I didn't know it was in there. I just, I wanted to; I don't know. I just had it in my hands up there. I don't know. I wasn't going to kill myself.
COUNSELOR: I don't hear you. 
CLIENT: I wasn't going to kill myself. 
COUNSELOR: Well, that's not the story I get. [Name inaudible - 04:12], what do you know about it?
CLIENT: [Inaudible - 04:16].
COUNSELOR: I can't hear you. 
CLIENT: [Inaudible - 04:20]
COUNSELOR: Yes, and knowing that once he cut his wrist with a razor, and the other time with a piece of glass, and he had been talking about killing himself, about dying, you felt that it would be wise to take no chances and that's what I agree with. Absolutely. Because the hell with analyzing why his testicles disappear, and why he's getting smaller and all the other insane symptoms. If we're going to work on that and he kills himself, what good is he? Do you understand that?
CLIENT: Yes sir. 
COUNSELOR: What did I just say? 
CLIENT: Why analyze the rest of it if I'm going to kill myself. 
COUNSELOR: Exactly. We don't want to lose you. [Silence]. Look at me. As you sit here thinking now, are you thinking that you would not like to kill yourself? When you shake your head, the microphone can't hear it.
CLIENT: Well...
COUNSELOR: I see you're still able to smile anyway. 
CLIENT: I don't know how.
COUNSELOR: Huh?
CLIENT: I don't know how or why.
COUNSELOR: Why what?
CLIENT: I'm still able to smile.
COUNSELOR: Why do you say that with such a forlorn hopeless point of view? You can't understand why you're able to smile at all anymore? What's happening to you so terrible?
CLIENT: What's so terrible about it is [long pause] losing feeling is what's so terrible about it. 
COUNSELOR: Explain that to me. It's a little difficult to understand. You're losing feeling about what?
CLIENT: About even being alive. 
COUNSELOR: You're losing feeling about even being alive as though you don't care if you're alive or not?
CLIENT: No, it's not like that. 
COUNSELOR: What is it? I don't understand you. 
CLIENT: [Silence].
COUNSELOR: When you talk to a person and you keep talking to them and he still doesn't understand, I just don't get it. After so long, a person should understand something. 
CLIENT: Yes. 
COUNSELOR: Now, who doesn't understand, you or I? 
CLIENT: [Silence] 
COUNSELOR: By that I mean, are you trying to tell me something that I don't get or are you disturbed because I'm trying to tell you something that you don't get?
CLIENT: Well, I think it's both.
COUNSELOR: I see. We're not really in rapport or connected.
CLIENT: You can't see how I could not want to get ahead in life, and I can't see that either, but as I am now, I know that I'm just this way and it's, I don't know. It's like; my words, I just want to go. 
COUNSELOR: Where? 
CLIENT: I can't tell you that. I think a person like this, like myself doesn't know where. Can't explain it to a person, like you, that would know where you'd want to go. That's the only way I can put it.
COUNSELOR: I understand that very well. I think you want to go somewhere where you can be attached to something. You never had the love of the mother. She couldn't be attached to you. You tried to be attached to her, but you know that she called up here and said she hoped you'd be dead. And you also know that she accused you and your father of being out of the treatment unit consorting some place in the streets of Philadelphia at two o'clock in the morning. That's crazy, isn't it? You know that she's been institutionalized? Look at me. You know she's been mentally sick, don't you? Don't shake your head. Say yes or no.
CLIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: She's been mentally sick, hadn't she? And, when a person is mentally sick, they can't be concerned about somebody else. They're too busy being concerned about themselves. We call that narcissism-like. Do you understand that? When you're as upset as you get, can you be worrying about somebody else? 
CLIENT: [Silence].
COUNSELOR: I don't hear you. 
CLIENT: Yes, I think so. Probably.
COUNSELOR: Let me give you an example. When you thought your body was shrinking, and your testicles had disappeared, and you were turning into�
CLIENT: Oh, well no.
COUNSELOR: Were you busy thinking about that or somebody else?
CLIENT: I was too busy thinking about that. 
COUNSELOR: Well your mother goes through things like that all the time. I saw her the other day sitting there by herself in the corner and talking to herself at a great rate. Do you think she was listening to voices? She certainly was not paying attention to anybody else, because I was right at the next table, and she was not paying attention to anything except the voices. She hardly even noticed the waitress when she came by. So, then you were never able to find your mother, then you turned to find your father, but he was very unresponsive, wasn't he? He had feeling, but he couldn't express it. He was like you. He was silent, wasn't he? I'm talking to you. Don't shake your head.
CLIENT: I don't know what you mean by silent.
COUNSELOR: Did your father talk and make himself understood? Did he relate to you very actively? 
CLIENT: As what I can remember. What I can remember, he did.
COUNSELOR: Well, then if have you found solid comfort in the relationship with your father, why did you want to leave? Why didn't you go to�?
CLIENT: Why did I leave where?
COUNSELOR: Huh?
CLIENT: Leave where?
COUNSELOR: You left Philadelphia and went to New Orleans. You wanted to leave the world by cutting your wrist. You're trying to find peace some place. You're trying to find some kind of unity for yourself. It's clear that you have not found it here. And in some way, I fail to relate to you properly. You're shaking your head. 
CLIENT: I failed to relate to you. 
COUNSELOR: And you failed to relate to me, but that doesn't mean that we can't ultimately relate to each other. I don't fail to relate to the other people in this room, and they don't fail to relate to me. And I'm trying very hard to relate to you. For some reason, you won't have me. Do you know why? Don't make your mouth tight like that. Take me in a little bit. You make your mouth tight and you don't look at me. You don't want to take me in at all. I can see that. But I take you in. My eyes are right on you, aren't they? My mouth doesn't shut as tight as a clam, does it? But yours does. And you get silent. 
CLIENT: I don't know what to say.
COUNSELOR: Why don't you love me? 
CLIENT: [Silence].
COUNSELOR: When you look at me, you're making a frown. You make your mouth as tight as a clam. 
CLIENT: I don't know. 
COUNSELOR: Why don't you get up and put your arms around me and give me a kiss? 
CLIENT: [Silence]
COUNSELOR: There goes your mouth again, and you look away. You don't want to come near me. 
CLIENT: [Silence].
COUNSELOR: Now you smile. And there goes that mouth again. When you smile, you almost let me in. Are you afraid that it would mean something homosexual if you did that?
CLIENT: No, not [inaudible - 17:26] you explained to me.
COUNSELOR: Exactly. There is a total feeling that's called love. In it, to a slight extent, is sex. But sex alone is far far from love. And what I have in mind between you and me, if it has anything to do with your penis or anything like that, or my penis, it's so unconscious, that I don't notice it. It's almost as though I didn't feel it, or it's almost as though you didn't feel it. Or maybe in you it's stronger. When I say love, maybe you just think penis.
CLIENT: No. 
COUNSELOR: Eh?
CLIENT: No sir.
COUNSELOR: Well, I'm glad to hear that. You were concerned that you were becoming a woman, you know. I thought maybe that was still working on you. Because if you were a woman, then you'd be interested in my penis, wouldn't you? 
CLIENT: [Silence].
COUNSELOR: I didn't hear you.
CLIENT: I don't know about that.
COUNSELOR: Well, but there is a possibility, isn't it?
CLIENT: That's a possibility, I guess.
COUNSELOR: Yes. But you're not a woman. I promise, neither am I. So, if that's what's keeping you away from me, and away from everybody�
CLIENT: Yeah, they're kind of talking like that. 
COUNSELOR: They are?
CLIENT: No, they're kind of speaking like that. It's pretty�
COUNSELOR: It's what?
CLIENT: I mean when you said homosexual love and things like that, it, something I never understood. I never thought about. 
COUNSELOR: Well�
CLIENT: And, I mean, you know, I can see that, what you were talking about before.
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Every man has unconscious homosexuality. Because every man loves his father to me. What do you call that? When a man loves a man?
CLIENT: I've always called it respect. 
COUNSELOR: You see now, do you think that respect means love? Do you see how frightened you are to face this honestly? Do you think that respect and love mean the same thing? 
CLIENT: No, not when it really comes down to it. 
COUNSELOR: Of course not. You see, you are frightened at these thoughts. But we'll reach each other. It's going to take time. And we're going to do it just this way; sitting and discussing with each other. Just like the other day when I explained to you that you have two minds. One is what? 
CLIENT: Conscious and unconscious.
COUNSELOR: That's right. Conscious and unconscious. And these thoughts that I'm talking about now are in which mind? 
CLIENT: The conscious mind. Half the conscious mind.
COUNSELOR: No, not me. I wouldn't fool around with your penis for $10 bucks, and I wouldn't let you fool around with mine either. So where are these thoughts if they're there at all?
CLIENT: The unconscious mind. 
COUNSELOR: In the unconscious mind. Now you've got it. And in the conscious mind, is listening what we're talking about. The explanation, you see. The intelligent part of this thing. The conscious mind is able to say respect doesn't mean love anymore than having intercourse means love. It may be one of the elements that go in to what makes up love. Do you agree with that? I didn't hear you.
CLIENT: I agree with that. 
COUNSELOR: And I'm sure that when you begin to love me in the way that I mean, like a father and son or like two brothers, or like, I don't know; like I am with he would do anything for me and I would do anything for him. And if I die, he'll cry at my funeral. And if he dies, I will too. See? That's the kind of something that happens between two people that's close and good. They understand each other. They feel about each other. They are sympathetic. They are comrades. They have companionship. They go out and eat together the way you and I did. Do you remember? 
CLIENT: [Silence].
COUNSELOR: Don't shake your head.
CLIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: Do you remember? And you had trouble taking in the food then. You have trouble taking in anything, especially me. Also me. You can't take me in either. And it maybe because of the penis taking in, you know. Maybe that's what holds us back from being close to each other. But as we talk and talk, and as time goes on, and if you don't have a chance to kill yourself. Because if you kill yourself, I'm licked. Right? 
CLIENT: [Silence].
COUNSELOR: I didn't hear what you said.
CLIENT: Yes sir.
COUNSELOR: And if you kill yourself, then you become a hopeless case because after that, I can't kill you anymore. But if we keep working with each other like this, and you stay alive, we'll get to that level that I'm talking about. And when you feel it, you'll have courage enough to live. You will want to live. You will want to see me. You will want to tell me about what you did, and the job that you've got, and the wife that you've married, and the kids that you've got and all that sort of stuff. 
CLIENT: [Silence].
COUNSELOR: You're throwing me out again. Do you feel a little emotional or sentimental or affectionate? You took your eyes away from me, and you made your mouth tight. You don't want to take me in with your eyes, and you don't want to take me in with your mouth. And maybe you don't even want to listen to me. You don't want to take me in with your ears. That's just what makes you run to a place to find something. Well, something is right here in front of you. You shake your head yes, but I wonder if you really mean it. If I gave you a razor and turned you loose in the toilet now, what would you do?
CLIENT: Probably shave. 
COUNSELOR: Okay, but you said "Probably." Or what else might you do? 
CLIENT: Nothing I guess.
COUNSELOR: Do you think you'd kill yourself? That worries me. Remember how mad I got when you cut your wrist last time? It's the only time I ever belted you in the jaw, isn't it? Eh, you remember? I don't hear you. 
CLIENT: Yes sir. I know.
COUNSELOR: That's one thing I can't stand. I really love you. If you died, I would be too unhappy. But if I died, you'd probably, you know; so what? That's where the trouble is. You're just like your mother. With your mother, if you died, so what? Don't make your mouth so tight. You always do that. And now you close your eyes and you make your mouth tight. This goes back to your mother. Take me in. 
CLIENT: [Silence].
COUNSELOR: Hey, right here. What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: My [inaudible - 27:20]. I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Have you thought of hurting me?
CLIENT: No. I thought I was.
COUNSELOR: That you were hurting me? Do you know why you were hurting me?
CLIENT: [Silence]. Do I know why?
COUNSELOR: How are you hurting me?
CLIENT: I was taking part of your blood or something. 
COUNSELOR: You were taking part of my blood? That shows you how crazy a guy is when he thinks about killing himself. They only said that in order to kill yourself, you have to be completely in a deep dream. You really don't know you're doing it. Did you know that you were killing yourself when you were cutting your wrist with a razor? What was operating then, your conscious or your unconscious mind? 
CLIENT: Well, I don't know what it was. I guess it was my unconscious mind.
COUNSELOR: Was it something that you were doing in a dream? I don't hear you.
CLIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: I always think that, that a suicide, if you could wake up, what he was trying to do would seem like a dream. Well, here, you can have a bite. Here, or would you rather just kiss it?
CLIENT: No, I wouldn't; I'd rather to eat it. 
COUNSELOR: I don't mind if you have some of my blood. All right. I'll see you later.
CLIENT: Yes sir.
