BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
PATIENT: It's a really unconstructive way that I find my mind working in this really unconstructive way. I can identify it's not productive and not constructive but I can't, I haven't really been able to find a way to change yet.
COUNSELOR: Ok.
PATIENT: Specifically, I just get really hurt about things that if I thought about it rationally they probably shouldn't hurt me as much as I feel that they do. And I respond proportionately to how much they hurt me but probably not proportionately to what actually happened.
COUNSELOR: Ok.
PATIENT: And the hard part is I'm able to recognize that. I just really haven't been able to adjust the way I receive and intake that information. I just do. I do get hurt so easily and so then I tend to get upset or disappointed and (inaudible at 0:00:47.6). So I was talking about this with this friend of mine and she said she'd experienced some feelings that were similar and so she was speaking with somebody and really recommended that I do the same. 0:00:59.4
COUNSELOR: Ok.
PATIENT: So I thought that we could start.
COUNSELOR: Ok. Well, I'm glad you're here.
PATIENT: I am too.
COUNSELOR: I think it's always really good that people wish to improve themselves and work on some of these things. Everyone has issues. And everyone has problems. You agree your different to do this. Did you ever get therapy before?
PATIENT: No. This is my first time ever.
COUNSELOR: Ok.
PATIENT: I'm kind of nervous but.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:25.0) So I guess, can you tell me a specific fact that would best illustrate?
PATIENT: Well yeah. I'm living with my fiancé now. So poor guy has to like bear the brunt all of my creepiness and my... No, he'll do something just that suggests that he's not distracted or really like emotionally connecting. Which I really value really connecting with people. And I think it's like, "Oh, he's not listening to me right now. Which means he doesn't love me. Which means I'm not worth loving. Which means I'm a bad person." And it's just this like slippery slope of thoughts. 0:01:59.9
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And I try to think of them and like that doesn't necessarily follow logically from what just happened. But sometimes I can't stop myself and be rational .It just happens so fast and I get so worked up.
COUNSELOR: Right. So let's sort out the topic a little. So what does he do that makes you think?
PATIENT: Ok. For example, I could be talking about something that's really important to me. Like how I'm stressed out at work or having trouble with something. And he does, "Um hmm, um hmm, ok." And then just like get up and walks away and starts doing something else. He might still be listening. He might be. But I'm just like, "You're not solely purposed on what I'm saying to you. And this is really painful for me to talk about. And so I feel like you're not supporting me." And so then I tend to like lash out and get defensive like, "How come you're not listening? This is really important to me. You don't love me." Kind of like that, in that range. 0:02:56.8
COUNSELOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: Which I just feel like it's happening more frequently than it should. And more frequently than he should have to put up with and I find myself feeling really disappointed in myself and upset with myself. And I treat him poorly as a result of it. Kind of this vicious cycle. Because I feel worse about myself. And then I'm worried was he hurt because of the way I react to him. It's not good.0:03:19.3
COUNSELOR: Yeah, It sounds like you have very good insight into what's going on.
PATIENT: I feel like I do have insight. And it's just, I really want to come up with some like constructive ways to actually use that insight.
COUNSELOR: Right, right. But then I think that the moment it's happening that insight's not there.
PATIENT: It's not. It's just hurt and pain and anger.
COUNSELOR: Right. You get hurt and angry (inaudible at 0:03:41.1). How does it get resolved?
PATIENT: Like in the example with my fiancé, I have a wonderful fiancé. And he's like, "No. This doesn't mean I don't love you." You know like, "I have a different way of interacting with people. And I still love you . I still support you. All of my other actions demonstrate that." And then, I know it's kind of weird to him so he starts to ask questions like, "What do you need me to do to prove that I love you?" In which case I end up feeling less loved and it just kind of compounds. So, yeah. 0:04:16.3
COUNSELOR: So at the time that you're real stressed out and you're kind of venting or (inaudible at 0:04:21.8) and he is not 100 percent attentive to you and kind of get off into other things.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Then what thoughts pop into your head?
PATIENT: Well my thoughts are, it's like if I got up and walked away while you were talking to me, it would mean I was disinterested. (inaudible at 0:04:38.8) not disinterested not interested in what the person was saying. I wasn't really emotionally available for them. I have other things on my mind that are at the forefront of my mind because I'm acting on them.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Whereas I'm learning that like he on the other hand, he is listening. He takes a while to digest it. He does other things while he's digesting so he can give feedback later. Or he can concentrate with like half his mind on what you're saying but also take care of things that need to be taken care of, like when your under stress or something like that. 0:05:10.0
COUNSELOR: Right. So what you're telling me is that people have different way of doing things.
PATIENT: Right, right, yeah. I mean, but I'm not really accepting of in the moment. When I think about it, I'm like "Yeah, that makes sense. We're all different people. Obviously we have different ways of interacting." But in the moment it's like if you don't act how I would act, I get really disappointed and hurt.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: So it's kind of, I really want to develop some kind of strategy or game plan so that like when I'm in the moment I can think as lucidly as I can like with events that happen in the past.
COUNSELOR: Right, right. So at that moment do you think, he doesn't me or he shouldn't be doing this or he shouldn't be doing that. When your thinking starts, what's the emotion that you feel? 0:05:55.5
PATIENT: I just get so hurt. And I get to this point to where I'm feeling like if I was worthy of this person's attention or love then they wouldn't be doing these other things. So there's something about me that's making them unwilling to connect. Or that's making them unwilling to support me. So my immediate thought is always like they don't love me. I just always kind of jump to that conclusion so quickly.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And I mean it's almost to the point where like my fiancé you know is just like, "You're looking for ways to prove that I don't love you." And I mean that might have some validity. I feel like I do have such high expectations that the slightest veering off course really makes me question their motivations.
COUNSELOR: Right. So when you think that, when you're really convinced that someone doesn't love you of course you feel very, very, hurt.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Very pained.
PATIENT: Right. 0:06:56.2
COUNSELOR: So a theory that we use here, the reason why you feel the unhealthy emotions we call it. Unhealthy means you're very, very hurt. It could mean anxious. It could be depressed. The reason why you think this, have these feelings is the way you think about things. If you're thinking, "He really doesn't love me. He doesn't love me enough." Then you're going to feel very, very hurt.
PATIENT: Right, right.
COUNSELOR: So how we change that unhealthy emotion to healthy negative emotion is we change our thinking about things.
PATIENT: Ok.
COUNSELOR: Right? So that's kind of, that's the philosophy I will do here.
PATIENT: Ok. Yeah, it sounds perfect. Because I know maybe some of these feelings won't necessarily stop. But I know there are more constructive ways to think about things.
COUNSELOR: Right. So it's not like you let's say someone hurt you, we don't want you to be indifferent about it.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: You can be disappointed. But we don't want you to feel so hurt that you're doing thing that are mean or you're distressed.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: We'll see that unhealthy negative substitute a more healthy one, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: And we'll do that by looking to see what our irrational reasons are.
PATIENT: Ok. 0:07:58.2
COUNSELOR: Ok? So why do you think you act irrationally?
PATIENT: Oh God. Well, I think a lot of it stems back to like, I've always had, like the song says cast out concepts of confidence issues. And so I really do tend to immediately jump to I don't deserve to be loved. I mean I'm not worthy of this and that's why it's not being shown. Which I know is not true. I mean my close friends and family demonstrate every day they love me.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And I know they love me. It's just when I get hurt I just immediately go back to that kind of disturbing, like comforting feeling of I just don't deserve it. That's why this is happening to me. It's just so familiar that it's comforting even thought it's a negative thing.
COUNSELOR: Right, right. Only from the positive that you get out of feeling this way or thinking this way. 0:08:57.7
PATIENT: Well, I mean in a certain way like, positive? Well in a way it kind of allows me to keep the other people who I'm interacting with blameless. Because I mean like if I'm not deserving of their love then it's not their fault that they don't love me. And I think so highly of the people I'm close to that I would rather the fault to lie within me than within them. And so I think that's (inaudible at 0:09:34.1).
COUNSELOR: All right. In thinking that way, how does this advantage to you?
PATIENT: Well I mean it's really putting me in a hard position because not only, like I'm not allowing people to love me. Like no matter how much they demonstrate that they do, I'm always questioning that. And so it's never like, I never am able to have the sense of satisfaction of yeah, they do love me. Like even the really positive things in my life are like, they are acting like they love me now but last week they did that thing that they must not. So it's really preventing me from ever feeling secure or loved. Or really feeling like I really do connect with people. 0:10:20.8
COUNSELOR: Right, right. So how do show, do you love people? You do right?
PATIENT: Yeah I do. I do. I love the people in my life just so deeply. They are the center of my world.
COUNSELOR: Right. You sound like you do. Just the way you describe your fiancé it sounds like you love him a lot.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Your pain gives him pain because of there's a lot of love there.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So can you define for me what your definition of you loving someone is like?
PATIENT: Oh my God. I tend to be a person who feels things really deeply, be it positively or negatively. And when I really love someone I kind of get this ecstatic feeling like just thinking about them. It radiates. I just, it's just an amazing feeling. And I just want them to be happy. Like I'm willing to do whatever is necessary to make these people happy. I mean because I love them to see them happy. But also in some kind of selfish sense to be able to see them happy. Because that's what reinvigorates me. 0:11:24.8
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Yeah. So it's really, it's just that overwhelming concern for their, for them to be happy.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And like a problem recently I was with my fiancé. We were fighting. We're a couple that we're always nitpicking and stuff like that. And I was honestly like, I love him so much that I don't want him to have to endure this kind of thing. And so like I'd rather be without him and have him be happy than be with him and have him be miserable. And I was so convincing myself that he would be happier elsewhere that I was like forcing this on him. Like we shouldn't be together. This is hurting you. Even though what's best for him in his mind is for us to be together. And probably really is best for us to be together because we love each other. So it's just, yeah it's really unproductive. 0:12:19.2
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. That's how you should love. You should love passionately (inaudible 0:12:23.6) about it. You know you love him that much that he went away when (inaudible at 0:12:29.4) and said that. He almost believed (inaudible at 0:12:32.3).
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Now just like a couple of minutes ago we said people do different things.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: So how many examples do you know who show love differently? Do you know who show they love someone, it could be the movies, it could be real life. You know for sure this person love someone but they show love differently than you do. How do they show love? 0:12:51.0
PATIENT: My father, he's such a wonderful man and he shows my sister and I that he loves us, so much love and so really, really supportive. But he's like always pushing us to be the best that we can be. Like I really helps me to say that because I don't want to be pushy, like expects all these like great things and is dissatisfied at the job. But he just realizes our true potential and really pushes us toward them. Like really forces us to knuckle down and accomplish what we could. And I would just be more content to be like however you're happy. Like it doesn't matter if you're kind of half assed something as long as you're like happy with what you do. And so he does that. Or like, (inaudible at 0:13:46.1) we live together in a very small apartment. But my fiancé is very quiet and very subtle about how he loves. So if I were to say, "Oh, I love you." Like I say it to a lot of people and I generally mean it. But you know it takes him a while to say something like that or to just express it like emotively as I do. Some people are like spastically, oh my God, I love you. Whereas he would just be more like after a while like, well, I really love you. 0:14:18.9
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Right.
PATIENT: So I mean both he and my dad do it differently. But like I know I'm acting like that they both so really love.
COUNSELOR: Right. And I think just by hearing you talk about it it's not like you said I mention it a lot. It's more like (inaudible at 0:14:36.6) other people's feelings, other people's thoughts. So what's the point of doing too much (inaudible at 0:14:39.6) kind of your ideals and how you see things onto them.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: If they don't do that then you take it as an expression of how they feel about you.
PATIENT: Exactly. I mean that is exactly, and that's what I've come to realize like if people don't act how I would in a certain situation, I am, I'm like holding them to these really rigid standards of what it would be for me, of what love would be for me. And if they don't act in a way that would be how I would act. I'm just like that means they don't love me. I just read so much into certain attitudes and reactions that isn't there. Because that's not how their mind is thinking. That's not how their heart is working. 0:15:18.1
COUNSELOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: And one of those things I'm able to talk about and see when I'm not in it.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And when it doesn't involve me. Like if were talking about my Dad loving somebody else, like I can totally say it. When it's about me or my fiancé's feelings about me I just immediately jump to, "Oh, they're disappointed." Or they don't love me.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. So, ok, so it's good. So what do you think gets in the way of you thinking rationally in that situation?
PATIENT: It's just overwhelming sense of hurt. But I feel like it is so easy to hurt me. And so easy for me to be hurt really, really deeply just because I'm so out there with my emotions it's so expected. And when I feel any kind of rejection or you know, anybody shows me love in a different way I mean it just like hurts me to the core where I literally can't function or think about anything other than the hurt. It's just like this feeling of like I'm drowning because it just overwhelms me like a wave would. And then I just have to kick and fight against this feeling and that's when I act out and I say mean things when I normally wouldn't. It's my only way of trying to survive it because it's so painful. 0:16:49.2
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And I mean I have a pretty good pain tolerance for physical pain but like emotional pain devastates me. Like literally just my body collapses on itself. My whole brain stops functioning and it's just a throb.
COUNSELOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: And I just want to find a way that I can take like every day occurrences and thoughts and actions and make them into something that's not just so completely debilitating for me. Like so that my mind can still work while I'm being hurt. Because I realize I'll still always be hurt. Which is ok, but I just want to be able to think and not go into immediate survival mode. 0:17:31.4
COUNSELOR: Right, right. How often does this happen?
PATIENT: It does happen fairly frequently. Right now, so my fiancé and I are living a 800 square foot bungalow. We sleep in a full size bed. So it's like always together. So there's lots, there's just so many opportunities for little things to trigger me.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: So I feel like you know something happens every other day where I just hurt so badly that I react badly.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And I mean I think that's part of why I'm coming in now rather than earlier because I think this is something that I always struggled with but now it happens so frequently because I'm so exposed to things that will trigger me.
COUNSELOR: Right, right. 0:18:25.3
PATIENT: So and that's just what's so worrying. You don't want to be, you don't want to be feeling like that every day. So.
COUNSELOR: That's, I understand what you're saying. I feel your pain.
PATIENT: Ok.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, so that's very frequently when things happen you're going to like think (inaudible at 0:18:42.7) of things to walk away and feel rejected and feel like nobody loves you. That's an automatic conclusion you're jumping to.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: So that's your thought. What can you say to dispute it?
PATIENT: I kind of tired this. I tried doing this like little mantra. Because he's really trying too, trying to think of ways to get it so that it doesn't hurt me.
COUNSELOR: Right. 0:19:03.6
PATIENT: And you know I try to keep in my head he loves me. So he would never intentionally do anything to hurt me. He loves me. He would never do anything intentionally to hurt me.
COUNSELOR: Uh huh.
PATIENT: And I try to repeat that. And like I've found that I can't quite, I can't conquer that fear yet.
COUNSELOR: Why not? Why don't you just let it, why don't you let this mantra work?
PATIENT: I think it really is because there's hurt shuts off my brain. Like I have to disconnect from it somehow. Just because it's so painful. And so my brain stops thinking and I'm just feeling. And all I'm feeling is hurt. And so I'm not getting my rational thoughts of, "You know, you said you love me five seconds ago. And you know he loves me every day." And that king of thing. 0:19:57.9
COUNSELOR: As a woman, I don't think that no matter how much he says he loves you, how much he says (inaudible at 0:20:05.0) your convinced that no one can love you.
PATIENT: Wait, I don't believe it.
COUNSELOR: Right, exactly, exactly. You don't believe it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I mean right now right now that emotion's out. You can't rationalize it. All you are is, I don't say emotion, but the moment you're convinced in your head that he doesn't love you.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: But you think that you're not really disputing the thought.
PATIENT: You're right.
COUNSELOR: You're not really buying into it.
PATIENT: Right, yeah exactly. That's one thing I want to discover is what that saying is or what that thing is that I can connect with that actually puts it into perspective and makes it real rather than just these thoughts that are not based on anything.
COUNSELOR: So let's think about now. Did you say it is love, how can you dispute it?
PATIENT: Oh my God, how can you dispute that?
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Just for a second. You can't be biased when you're in love. 0:21:02.6
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You want (inaudible at 0:21:03.6)
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know how hard it is to do it when you're in love.
PATIENT: Right. I mean that's completely true. I mean this has been so worrying to me that I have been trying to think about it even when I'm not upset.
COUNSELOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: And that, I think this is really like the kicker, I'm not sure what those things to be telling myself or those things to be thinking are that we'll just think that just because I really still am not sure that I do deserve to be loved or if that's even possible for someone to love me.
COUNSELOR: You know what do you have to do to be loved?
PATIENT: I don't know. Like not, it's (inaudible at 0:21:56.9) like I see this as a serious feeling in myself. That I think this way and I'm not strong enough to even take control of my thoughts and my actions and you know, that I'm week. And then you think like why would people love someone who can't even control what they're thinking and saying and doing. And so I come back to that thought. And so it completely makes sense to me in that moment. Like you're acting crazy right now. Why would anybody love a crazy person? He can't possibly love me. It's kind of my worst thought. Maybe it's like, nip it in the bud and get rid of all those premises or like convince yourself that one of those premises is false so that you believe the conclusion is false. Or find something in there that doesn't logically follow. 0:22:54.1
COUNSELOR: So do you have to be 100 percent lovable to be loved?
PATIENT: Probably, I mean no. Right? No, right. But for me, yeah. It's always, it's always been this way. No matter where I'm just like I don't want, I've always felt this way for a really long time. I don't want to be with anybody right now because I don't want to be with somebody who would accept me as I am right now. Because I'm not good enough right now. And I think that's kind of the thought that's carried though. You know like nobody should want me if I'm not perfect.
COUNSELOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: Even though I don't expect that of the people I love.
COUNSELOR: Right. That is the last thing you'd want. If you're not 100 percent perfectly lovable then you don't care to be loved.
PATIENT: Yeah, right. 0:23:48.2
COUNSELOR: So when will you get to the point where you're 100 percent lovable?
PATIENT: I have all sorts of like quirks and wisdom but it'll never make me like 100 percent like normally lovable. I know some people like quirks and stuff like that but something like this, like these really deep hurts and this tendency to really like hang on to bad stuff I think is like a serious obstacle. And I think it is something that's preventing me from being loved. And that's why it's like one of those things I want to work out. Just because I don't know how somebody can love me with as many flaws as I have. And even though I know I'll never be able to get rid of all my flaws and even though I don't expect other people to.
COUNSELOR: Right, right. 0:24:39.6
PATIENT: It's a weird, weird (inaudible at 0:24:42.5).
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. So I think you are, you can actually think this is weird and still you hold on to it so tightly.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Because if you give it up how would your life be different?
PATIENT: Oh God. I actually imagine it would just be really liberating. Like because I could finally be like, "Ok, I'm not 100 percent lovable but this person still does in fact love me." And you could just accept that and be ok with that. That would be huge. I think that would be radically different if I were able to think that way. And I really, I do desire to think that way. I'm just not sure how to train my mind to think that way.
COUNSELOR: Right. When you're so used to thinking one way for so long it's very hard to make that change. Especially if it comes very fast.
PATIENT: Yeah. 0:25:42.2
COUNSELOR: It's hard to kind of step out of yourself and then try to think differently.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So I understand it's so wonderful we had this talk and it's wonderful you understand it. Of course you can't do it but I think you want to.
PATIENT: Right, exactly. That's completely what it is. Because I know where I need to go.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And I really know how awesome it would be once I got there. And I keep trying these little things and none of them are working and none of them are really getting at that base problem. And I just can't crack how to get at that.
COUNSELOR: Right. So what else have you tried?
PATIENT: I mean like I kind of tried the mantra thing. I really tried like analyzing how it is I feel about other people. You know like I love my Mom. I love my sister. I love my best friends. I can readily admit that all those people have flaws.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And I love them so passionately. And you know it's kind of like, look at how much you love those people. It's ok and it's totally possible to love people who aren't 100 percent lovable. 0:26:41.3
COUNSELOR: Right. But they're not you though.
PATIENT: But they're me. Completely. Right. And you know so I kind of tried dissecting it out like that or you know I do have like, let's make a catalogue of all the different things that people do that show that they do love you.
COUNSELOR: Great.
PATIENT: And I'm like yeah, they do all those things. But they can't actually love me because I'm not lovable. You know it's a mute thing. No matter how rational I try and be or what strategies I really try.
COUNSELOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: So yeah. That's what I really want to work on. Finding, talking it out with somebody so that I can find some kind of strategy.
COUNSELOR: It's not like you need (inaudible at 0:27:26.1), which is (inaudible at 0:27:30.0) all that we mentioned. You tried to work at it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So it's going to be a lot of work
PATIENT: Yeah. Because that's something that I really want to do. I know I owe it to myself and I know I owe it to the people who love me.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: Because I mean they shouldn't have their pure intentions questioned either. Like they do love me. They shouldn't always be forced to prove it again and again and again and again to an impossible standard. So I'm just really now starting to see how it adversely it affects myself. But not only myself but those around me. 0:28:00.4
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And so that's I think what really motivated me to like step it up and do something.
COUNSELOR: Ok, good. So I think one thing, part of (inaudible at 0:28:11.7) a lot of work should be done at home when you're not upset. Because when you're making behavior changes or habit changes and thinking that comes so natural to you and you don't have to work at it. So usually we all look forward at the end of the session. Look at it and find out what worked, if it didn't work we try different things and go on.
PATIENT: Ok.
COUNSELOR: Ok you already said that you hurt pretty often. Every other day because you're really in a close relationship with your fiancé.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So I would think one thing to maybe track down those times when you do get upset.
PATIENT: Ok.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, so you know, I'm not expecting you not to be emotionally upset. It's going to happen. I shouldn't hold you to that standard either. Because why should you not get upset? It's something you've been doing for a long time.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Don't be, what I'm trying to say is, you tend to beat up yourself when you become that way. 0:29:01.2
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: But it's almost like why would you expect less now? Why would you not expect that if that's the way you've been all along?
PATIENT: Right. That makes perfect sense.
COUNSELOR: You could just say it's hard that for how long?
PATIENT: Three or four years?
COUNSELOR: Ok. It's not going to change overnight.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: But keep telling yourself I'm working at it. I'm working at it.
PATIENT: Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: Now will that be enough for you?
PATIENT: Working at it is good.
COUNSELOR: It's good.
PATIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: It's a start.
PATIENT: And I'm ok with a start. If only if it's like, you know it's a step in the right direction. Even if it doesn't work I'm at least trying something. Like I'm just really concerned. I want to invest enough and know I'm working on it.
COUNSELOR: Right, right. The reason I'm asking is because you tend to have the perfect idea...
PATIENT: No,
COUNSELOR: That's what I'm saying. It's not going to happen immediately.
PATIENT: Right, right.
COUNSELOR: It's not going to happen fast. It's a habit you've had for 24 years. For that to go away you're going to be working to fight it. But quit beating yourself up over it every time you don't succeed or you don't get the outcome that you want then you find that you get deeper set back or down about it. 0:30:04.8
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: The first step is like always difficult because of allowing yourself saying I thought this was really going to change overnight. Where you're at, this was the right direction.
PATIENT: Right
COUNSELOR: But if that's the right direction, you know.
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean it doesn't make sense to be like 24 years of thinking is going to change in a single day. And I do realize that. I know I'll probably still get a little bit down. Like, oh come on Kelly, you can do better than this. But that is something that I have given, tend to be trying to do recently, is things like, "Ok, this is an isolated event." And but it's a behavior, it's an attitude I've become comfortable with.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And so it's almost, it's like kicking a bad habit. It is kicking a bad habit.
COUNSELOR: Right. Absolutely.
PATIENT: And so I need to be ok with making small steps. And I fought those in other people so I should be able to do it. 0:31:02.5
COUNSELOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: I'm going to try it. 0:31:05.4
