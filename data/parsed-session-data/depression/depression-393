BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: We're back to this as a clock. I think, I think it probably went by the end of the last week
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: Morning.
CLIENT: Good morning. So, I'm not feeling so well. About the same as Friday. I'm stuck like I can't talk to anybody I guess I—
THERAPIST: I guess?
CLIENT: Because I'm afraid of something, saying something wrong or because it just feels like I get ticked off and mad at people now.
I just turn off with James too much to take, just problematic. Yeah. His standard mode of conversation is silly. Confrontational and I think that's fair, which is usually pretty fine, but these days I feel like I'm on trial whenever I talk to him, so I—it's just hard to, to talk. [00:01:52]
Yeah. So, there's a lot at work. It's like I manage to kind of carry me through and do what I need to do and that also means like being very cheerful and just having conversations with people and being chatty, but that takes up a lot of my mental energy for the day—yeah. [00:02:33]
You know, and I'm not actively—basically, when I'm not at work, most of the time it's like somewhere in there I feel really awful, but I can't quite let myself feel awful. It's though I just kind of feel like choked sort of. Yeah. Yeah, that's why I don't cry much. I just feel really bad, sort of. Sort of don't feel anything. I started to feel really tired. [00:03:38]
And I feel like we've been talking about this forever. We've been talking about this for a while now and I don't know what there is to be done about it. How to get unstuck. Part of it is I'm just really scared all the time. Like, just terrified that people will yell at me for something. Which seems ridiculous when I say it out loud, but, yeah, I—yeah, I'm afraid, you know. [00:04:42]
I'm afraid of talking to James because I'm afraid that we'll get in to a fight, but you know. We probably should be getting in to a fight because like he'll do something that pisses me off or he'll act toward me in a way that pisses me off and I won't be able to talk about it or bring it up, but yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah, this—it sort of sounds of a piece to me in that you seem to be more in touch more of the time when either ways you feel bad or things that are making you feel bad or even just kind of a sense that you feel bad. And you feel afraid that's going to get you in to trouble. [00:05:53]
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. I—on the way back from therapy last night I ran in to a friend from school. It was one of those like just, you know—
THERAPIST: On Friday you mean?
CLIENT: On Friday, yeah. Oh, the earth swallowed me whole and I just was going in to the subway station and he was just leaving, you know, and I kind of was not expecting to run in to anybody that I knew and so like he could really tell that I was not doing very well. And like, you know, he's somebody that, you know, it's okay that he knows that I'm not doing very well, but I, I don't really want him to see it on my face. It's just hard for me, so, I—. [00:06:54]
It was just this weird thing. Me, you know, just very distressed, but at the same time, like it was very easy for me to be kind of bright and chatty and I could kind of see myself doing that, but it, it yeah, it was sort of like disassociation that like, it was, I was not kind of there in the conversation. Yeah. [00:07:31]
He's a (laughter) he's a convert to Catholicism through; he went through the Episcopal Church. It's like from, like, evangelical to Episcopal and then Episcopal rank wasn't hardcore enough, so he went in to Catholicism. Oh, so, (laughter) my roommate, Candace and I, had a, a nickname for him. The surprisingly charming first things boy because his job after he graduated from college was an internship for First Things which is this like really super hard line, Catholic and Orthodox Jewish paper that like basically, like Catholic and organized— (talking at the same time) (inaudible at 00:08:24)
Yeah, basically like showing them, like they're kind of, you know in to myself (ph), but mostly like we're the hard asses on both side and we're really, we're right, we're right. And so, it physically just, it has a reputation for putting out pretty like horrible, horribly like jaw dropping pieces of—and yeah, if you talk to Tommy about what he believes in, you'll find out that he'll have some pretty like ridiculous beliefs. Like, he probably doesn't believe I should work outside the home, sort of thing.
THERAPIST: Wow. [00:09:03]
CLIENT: Yeah. But he is also really, really charming and really nice and caring and like very loving in conversation. So, I just try not to talk about what he believes. (laughter) But all of which is to say, you know, he said he'd heard, but look who's in town and like he was really, really glad to hear that because, you know, yeah, husband wife. It's—some theological idea about complementary that is really problematic in terms of gender that he is big proponent of. So, you know, being married is awesome and being with your husband is awesome, so, kind of hoping that like that might make thing better and it's just like it doesn't make things better I don't think. It makes things easier, but it doesn't make things better. [00:10:03]
I don't know what to do, to say to people like that. I don't know what to say to James—. You know, like yesterday I basically came home and then just like hid in my room and didn't leave the room and it was like he made dinner, he bought me dinner and we had dinner and then he did the dishes and that's kind of, like I feel bad that he's doing all of these things and I'm not doing my fair share, whatever that means. I feel bad, but I'm also, you know, glad that he's doing it, but I also, you know, I feel bad that it's like it's not making me better, you know. [00:11:02]
You know, like therapy helps, but it just doesn't seem to be making me not want to kill myself. But that doesn't seem to help because like it helps me function, but I kind of would rather not function sometimes, but—yeah—here I am.
THERAPIST: Yes. The things you—you most want to be able to rely on are letting you down or aren't helping. [00:12:05]
CLIENT: Okay. It doesn't like feel like letting me down. It feels like I'm letting them down—. Yeah—. [00:13:05]
THERAPIST: Like—I understand that this may continue for a while and that in a certain way, it's not such a novel thing. Let me be clear what I mean. It, of course, is an awful thing in that you're feeling awful. But it also seems to me like you're kind of less split off from it and you're more aware of how it's present and operating in your life. [00:14:35]
CLIENT: Sort of. You know—I mean, I'm aware of it which isn't to say that I've nipped it. You know. I'm a, I am sort of intellectually aware of it. But yeah, that's something. [00:15:13]
THERAPIST: And—though you just mentioned feeling guilty and, well, sort of guilty—you're also, you seem to be clear about how James without therapy or medications and what do and don't help, at least for now. Rather than having to see them as helping, but kind of knowing at moments otherwise. [00:16:23]
CLIENT: I just—.
THERAPIST: Because it seems that way to you?
CLIENT: Doesn't seem to make it easier—. Yeah, I just keep hoping that I, I won't somehow magically won't have to keep going like this. [00:17:45]
THERAPIST: What do you mean?
CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't really have to—. (silence from [00:17:51] to [00:18:35) Well, you know, I imagine things will get even better, but it, I, I wonder if that's mostly because I tend to be optimistic? (inaudible at 00:18:50) but I never really see this as a permanent state or like, you know, turn that to happy. [00:19:25]
I just don't like myself very much like this. Well, it's just a bad day. There's this strange thing going on with Eric (ph) where he's basically just like stopped talking to me and it really hurts my feelings. But then I think why am I, why are my feelings hurt? I, I don't want him to talk to me. Like, he really annoys me when he talks to me and I always just wish he would go away.
THERAPIST: Right. [00:20:41]
CLIENT: Which maybe is why he stopped talking to me. (laughter) Like, maybe I've just gotten less good at seeing other people the way they are. You know, I'm just less willing to kind of be with Eric (ph) in this like halcyon. Do all the drugs and talk about how you're going to bang all of the women and talk about how you have this idea for a paper and you're right and the other person's wrong and you're going to get published and you're going to be famous. I'm like oh, Eric (ph), oh. The depressing thing is it's probably going to work out like that for him. Yeah. You know how it is. He believes that he's hot shit. That goes a long way. And I don't, just have way less patience to listen to it—. But (inaudible at 00:22:26) that it's going to be a nightmare. [00:22:27]
THERAPIST: The move itself?
CLIENT: Yeah, but probably I shouldn't think of that. I just, I'm tired and I don't want to do it. Like, I want to be moved, but I don't really. Yeah, just really cranky. Really bad at hiding the fact that I'm cranky from people and usually I'm pretty good at that. I don't like this. [00:23:17]
I don't know what to say. I hate complaining like this. I'm feeling sorry for myself tonight, that too, but I do, and then I don't. And, I can't think of anything to say that's not apologizing for nothing in particular. (crying)
THERAPIST: Do you feel like bad company? [00:25:46]
CLIENT: Oh god, of course. (laughter) Yeah. I can't remember the last time I—had a, a social interaction that left me feeling good. It's surprising how when I think about it, because it, you know, I just kind of assumed that I, I would like to be around people because I'd say yeah, usually I do. Certainly thoughts of a weak sense of violations too. Yeah, but mostly I've been glad I went, but mostly did not feel good. [00:27:20]
THERAPIST: At home or wherever else.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: I guess nothing except a whole lot of, you know, crummy, despondent and cranky.
CLIENT: Yeah, but I already told you about that. (laughing)
THERAPIST: Absolutely. [00:29:06]
CLIENT: Yeah, I wonder about this. You know, but one of the things I really focus on is maybe taken at this, just like when I was in the hospital and, and in this partial program once. And, making yourself live your life because it's not really worth it but, you know, saying schedule your time, don't isolate yourself, you know, take care of yourself, eat well. Do things with people.
I've been kind of operating I think under the assumption that it's my duty to do these things to make myself feel better, but I'm not really sure they actually make me feel better. I mean I, I see the point of, you know, you function better when you're taken care of, but—it, it feels like most of my day is spent in constant denial of my own, of what I want, because I feel like what I want is not good for me. [00:30:46]
THERAPIST: And that's to be by yourself?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I'm mad at myself and took me a while (ph).
THERAPIST: What's in that set up? I mean by yourself, hurting yourself, not eating?
CLIENT: I was just; I watch a lot of TV because it's hard for me to think. And I just, I try to just sit with myself. You know, I kind of know that's what I'm doing, but it's like I just,—that's why I'm here.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:31:37]
CLIENT: It's nothing in this home. Yeah. Not like cleaning up after myself. Like not keeping the room clean. At least I don't have homework that I could not be doing. But, I finally wrote to the people and told them that I wasn't going to be able to give that paper.
THERAPIST: Oh that's right. (inaudible at 00:32:57)
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm, I'm still signed up for a, to talk at a conference and I just kind of really hoped that I would be able to do it. Really hoped, was hoping about it, but it's, it's at the point where I just needed to say no I'm not going to be able to do it. So, that was disappointing. Yeah. Better to have it before. [00:33:30]
THERAPIST: Does it feel at all, like among other things, there's something hurtful to the people who care about you in the way you want to be spending you time?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: And—.
CLIENT: I feel like I'm, I feel as though if I do what I want to do, it's just telling them I don't care enough because mostly what I want to do is not be around.
THERAPIST: I'm wondering also if there's an aspect, among others, of wanting to hurt them? [00:35:12]
CLIENT: Maybe, James, yeah, I want to blow up at him. But I don't want him to be hurt.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:36:08]
CLIENT: I find that very scary.
THERAPIST: Huh?
CLIENT: I find that very scary.
THERAPIST: I imagine you're both scared for him and scared of the like guilt thoughts (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't know what kind of person that makes me. [00:37:18]
THERAPIST: I mean, just want to address that very much, but in a way the human kind of person in that depression pretty much always involves some like anger and aggression or hurt the people one is closest to, but—.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like I said, you know, that doesn't help you much.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I more feel, I feel smothered around him. And it's like when we're asleep, I will just like, like I will kick him to take the bed clothes away from him like if I'm asleep. Like, I, I'm just entirely selfish in that way. (laughter) Oh, I mean, you know, sometime like you roll over one thing and the covers might come off and then I'm like no!
THERAPIST: I see. [00:38:51]
CLIENT: And I, yeah, I, just, I just want to get him off me. Like, you're going to have to leave me alone. But I don't really want him to leave me alone. (silence from [00:39:15] to [00:40:03) But I don't know how to deal with that. Yeah. I'm really scared that I will hurt him. Yeah, even the kind of the most minor and passive way of just removing myself. I know that hurts him and I worry that it does. Yeah, I don't even know how to think about that. Just hard for me to go there. [00:41:51]
THERAPIST: I see you don't have much room to maneuver.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Kind of because how you feel with him or even thinking about him.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like those (inaudible at 00:42:18) too?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it's just being hurt, it's horrifying to me. Yeah. Don't want anything other than good for him for his life. Yeah, how'd you like that to go away?
THERAPIST: Well, we should finish up now.
