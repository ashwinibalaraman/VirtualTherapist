BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So how have you been doing?
<b>PT:</b> I've been very sad, depressed.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Do you want to tell me about it?
<b>PT:</b> Yes sir.  It started this Monday.  Normally I take my medication, my Lexapro, at night
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But this week I've been going out to my nephew's home and I've been bathing his two little girls but on Tuesday night there was a confrontation between the mother and the son, my niece, [NAME OTHER] and her son, and I witnessed this event and she literally raised her hand, she charged her whole body towards this child and she pushed him in that back room because she, he had a TV remote
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And she was asking for the TV remote and he wouldn't give it to her and he said mama I'll kill you and when I heard that, she told me to take the girls downstairs which I did and they were fighting in that room and it was very loud and the little girls, my nieces, they were crying.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And so I just went in that protective mode and I hugged them, pulled them real close to me, and I told them everything is going to be all right and I started to pray.  Well, when I got home, I had been crying on the way to home.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But I didn't want to upset my mother and so I just dried my face and I talked to her a little bit and I didn't bring the incident up but I took my medication that night, I didn't sleep well at all that night and I woke up during the middle of the night.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I just felt awful and that happened on a Tuesday, this Tuesday, and I was very lonely and I felt afraid.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Like something was going to happen to me and I mainly just stayed to myself.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I didn't call anybody because I didn't want to worry anybody with my problems.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But I told my mother Wednesday morning what happened and it's been a very ugly week, I've never felt like this before.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> And I don't want to hurt myself, I'm not going to hurt myself because I love me.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But I'm just always so very depressed and I just, I don't want to stay in this hurt much longer.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I feel guilty because my mother's not able to walk.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> And I know she's hurting but I just, I can't please everybody and I won't please everybody, I mean they just have to take me for me.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And so I have problems just like everybody else.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> That's all.  I'm tired of taking medication.
<b>DR:</b> I think we need to use a little stronger medicine for a while.  Can you tell us a little more about what you've been through recently?
<b>PT:</b> Why am I always in pain?
<b>DR:</b> Pain?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What pain?
<b>PT:</b> With the surgeon, with my breast cancer.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I have pain up under my arm.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I notice I can't lift very heavy objects.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Because I notice like my little nieces, you know, they're small but the baby, well she's [AGE], and she's rather heavy.
<b>DR:</b> Healthy.
<b>PT:</b> Right and I pick her up and I notice at the end of the day, I get ready to go to bed, the pain will be much worse.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Have you had reconstruction?
<b>PT:</b> No sir.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> I don't feel, well, I don't trust that doctor.
<b>DR:</b> You don't trust the doctor?
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I feel like okay, he did my surgery.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But I have all this pain.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And he told me that I had the option that I could have the reconstruction or I could, you know, I don't have to have it and so, at that time, I told him, I said well, I decided not to because I have a low threshold of pain, I can't take a whole lot of pain, I'm just being honest.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Now how has the appearance of your chest affected you?
<b>PT:</b> Well in my mind it has affected me, I'd say on a moderate level.
<b>DR:</b> Tell me about it.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I can't wear low cut, well I choose not to wear low cut because one breast
<b>DR:</b> Because of appearance or because of religious stuff?
<b>PT:</b> Because of appearance and I mean it really took its toll, it not only feels [INAUDIBLE] but I guess emotionally.
<b>DR:</b> Self esteem?
<b>PT:</b> Yes sir.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, because I guess the breast are kind of like your sex organ, kind of like a man having his penis cut off.
<b>PT:</b> Yes sir.
<b>DR:</b> I can understand.
<b>PT:</b> And I felt like at the time when I had my surgery, I said well I'm not going to marry.
<b>DR:</b> Oh no.
<b>PT:</b> Again.
<b>DR:</b> You're too young to think like that.
<b>PT:</b> Well, that's the way I saw it.
<b>DR:</b> You kind of feel like giving up?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe we need to use a little stronger medicine for a while and see if you start feeling better and get going.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> So you've really been under a lot.  What else?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>DR:</b> Do you want to tell me about that?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] is so depressing to me.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> The area where I live.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Is so mundane, I mean day after day
<b>DR:</b> No excitement?
<b>PT:</b> No excitement.  I love beauty.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I love to be around positive people.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I like beautiful surroundings.  I mean the house that I live in is a very old house.  I keep it clean.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But it's a very old house.
<b>DR:</b> What, it needs a facelift?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yes sir.
<b>DR:</b> Well, why don't you all do that?
<b>PT:</b> Well.

<b>PT:</b> There's nowhere to go.
CG: She don't come out.
<b>PT:</b> I come out.  I go, [PHYSICIAN NAME], there's nowhere to go in [DEIDENTIFIED].
CG: [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> She got what?
CG: A two thousand Honda in almost mint condition.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
CG: Uh-huh.  I told her she can go to the park, walk around, get some sun.
<b>DR:</b> But she wants some excitement, be around people and see places.  She wants to go to things like museums and -
CG: Jump in the car, get a couple girlfriends and go.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], it's not as easy for a woman.  I know she has a military background, it's not an easy thing [INAUDIBLE].  Don't you explain that to him?
<b>PT:</b> No.
CG: She's got girlfriends.
<b>PT:</b> I don't have girlfriends.  I have one very good friend.
<b>DR:</b> You need to get involved in some organizations and do some things.  Don't you like stuff like that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I do, I really want to help people [PHYSICIAN NAME].
<b>DR:</b> There's a real need for it.  There's so many volunteer organizations and I want you to get back involved in the VA system out there too.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So you can get all your benefits and things like that.  That'll give you some freedom to do some volunteer things.
<b>PT:</b> I would love to do that [PHYSICIAN NAME].
<b>DR:</b> Which organizations [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> I want to help

<b>DR:</b> There are a lot of troubled ones.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.
CG: [PATIENT NAME] got a job working at an office and she was just a stones throw from our house.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
CG: And I don't really know why, what happened on the job, but she would be up there praying with the kids.
<b>DR:</b> I'm sure they needed it.
CG: Yeah but it was out of context, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, people got a little -
<b>PT:</b> Oh [PHYSICIAN NAME]
<b>DR:</b> They got upset
<b>PT:</b> I worked at night.  When I got to work, I worked from 11 to 7, those little boys would be in their bed, all I would do, I walked the hallways, I checked in on them to see if they were okay
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I just whispered, they were asleep.
<b>DR:</b> You were praying for them.
<b>PT:</b> I was praying for them.
<b>DR:</b> Who heard you?
<b>PT:</b> Sir?
<b>DR:</b> Who heard you and made a stink of it.
<b>PT:</b> Nobody, I don't know why [NAME OTHER] said that.
<b>DR:</b> Why would [INAUDIBLE] if it didn't cause any problems.
CG: Well, I think it did cause problems.
<b>PT:</b> It didn't cause
CG: [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
CG: She would be trying to be some kind of [INAUDIBLE], want to save folks, preach.
<b>DR:</b> But that's good.
CG: Well then she preached right on out the door.
<b>PT:</b> No, what happened is that I had a relapse, this is oh three
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And that little boy, they changed my schedule [PHYSICIAN NAME]
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> I used to work, I would go in on Thursday night and I'd work from Thursday night to Sunday night but the guy that they had working through the week, he started messing up, got the little boys medicine all messed up and so they told me, they said [PATIENT NAME], we're going to have to change your schedule so they put me on the Monday through Thursday during the day and so my responsibilities changed but that one particular morning, the guy that was helping me, he was in the kitchen and I went to wake the little boys up
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And the one little boy that I had the problem with and I loved this child more than any of them but he was provoking this other little boy and so I got in between them and he called me Satan and so I said well I'm not Satan and you're not getting to this other little boy and so later he apologized to me [PHYSICIAN NAME] and I went in his room and he told me, he said [PATIENT NAME], I was right about my daddy and when he told me that [PHYSICIAN NAME], I went bonkers.  I just started, well, I just
<b>DR:</b> How old was he?
<b>PT:</b> He was [AGE] at the time.  And so I said we'll talk about this later.  I said you've got to get ready, get your breakfast, because you've got to go to school and that child hugged me.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But I'll tell you, when he left and my supervisor came and he said, [PATIENT NAME], how was your night, oh I just broke down in tears.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I had a relapse.
<b>DR:</b> Well that's such a draining place you were in.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And guess who was already tired?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> You were just drained.  So we're going to put you on a stronger medicine.  I want you just to kind of relax and get your strength back and not worry about anything.  I want you to the VA and let's get all this stuff going.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> When you get charged up, then you can start doing things again.
<b>PT:</b> Yes sir.
<b>DR:</b> With the [INAUDIBLE], you start doing some things for yourself too, you like boosting people off, you've got to [INAUDIBLE] if you want to be boosting people off.
<b>PT:</b> Right, okay.
<b>DR:</b> I enjoyed talking to you.
<b>PT:</b> You too, [PHYSICIAN NAME].
<b>DR:</b> Okay, any questions you want to ask me?
<b>PT:</b> No sir.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, we'll keep it like we're doing and I'll get the medicine for you.
