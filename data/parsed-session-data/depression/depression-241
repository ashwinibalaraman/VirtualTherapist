BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	And she's also here today with her husband.  And thank you very much.  I appreciate you participating in the research.  Would you like to keep this or?
<b>CG:</b>	I have one.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, yeah, you've got a copy.  That's great.  So how have things been going?
<b>PT:</b>	The same.
<b>DR:</b>	I know that the last time we met you had some medical appointments scheduled, and I wonder if any, any of those, you know, revealed anything new to pursue, you know, what they might have thought about the fact that you had the tick bite behind your ear, whether you started antibiotics at all.
<b>CG:</b>	We did.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Which, which—
<b>CG:</b>	We, um, we went to the, uh, do you want to talk or you want me to talk?  It doesn't matter to me.  I'll talk.  Uh, we went to the rheumatologist.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Maybe a week after we saw you.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	No, it was the next day.
<b>CG:</b>	The next day.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Um, she's suggesting cutting the Plaquenil—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	To see if it had any effect at all.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Just to rule it out.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, we stopped that for 3 weeks.  Um, that didn't do anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, either way?
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, well the pain increased a little bit.
<b>DR:</b>	It did.  Okay, okay.
<b>CG:</b>	So we discussed antibiotics, and she suggested because of the doxycycline—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Um, because it has effects of you're not supposed to be in the sun—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>CG:</b>	She didn't want to—
<b>DR:</b>	You can be very photosensitive.
<b>CG:</b>	We called her the week before vacation, and said it's getting worse pain wise—
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>CG:</b>	But the mood's not any better.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	She said start the, go back to the dose we were on.
<b>DR:</b>	Of the Plaquenil.
<b>CG:</b>	And then call us after vacation—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	And we'll start antibiotics.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	So that's where we are.  We started doxycycline the Wednesday after our vacation because she's only in the office on Wednesdays.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, and what—
<b>CG:</b>	That was—
<b>DR:</b>	Date was that?
<b>CG:</b>	That, I don't have a calendar in front of me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I have this one.  If you remember your vacation, I can probably.
<b>CG:</b>	I do.
<b>PT:</b>	Third week in August.
<b>DR:</b>	Third week in August, okay.
<b>CG:</b>	We were on vacation the [DATE] to the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b>	Basically when I was.
<b>CG:</b>	So it would be the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you started on the [DATE].
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	So it's been—
<b>CG:</b>	Almost.
<b>DR:</b>	Almost 2 weeks, okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Almost 2.
<b>DR:</b>	I think so.
<b>CG:</b>	I thought it was more than that.
<b>DR:</b>	Isn't that weird, yeah, because, um, the [DATE]—
<b>PT:</b>	It would be 2 today.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, uh, Wednesday, the [DATE]—
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Would be 1 week—
<b>PT:</b>	Tomorrow.
<b>DR:</b>	And tomorrow the [DATE] will be 2 weeks.
<b>CG:</b>	I was thinking it going on 3.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.
<b>CG:</b>	It seems like longer, um, and then she said she didn't want to go right straight to the IV because—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	She wanted to try this first.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm absolutely thrilled—
<b>CG:</b>	And she said—
<b>DR:</b>	That she thinks there could be something to it.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, she, she also was concerned, well she said—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	It's not always the case, but the reactive C typically goes down in somebody with inflammation and who has a decrease in pain with the Plaquenil, but [PATIENT NAME] didn't go down.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	And she thought that was a little odd.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>CG:</b>	She says she's seen it before, but that was atypical.
<b>DR:</b>	And that's what makes me suspect that—
<b>CG:</b>	If I'm getting anything wrong, correct me if you remember.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	If you remember.
<b>DR:</b>	It's, it's pretty in tune with the research that I've been doing as well.  Um, they tend to find unexpected or, or, um, contradictory lab results when there's the chronic infection like lyme present, which is interesting.  Um, I have another patient who has fibromyalgia and lyme, definitely has both, and her lab results are nominal, but what might be expected.  Another piece of research I've done recently suggests that Plaquenil and doxycycline work especially well together getting into the cysts.  One of the really tricky things with treating lyme disease is that it goes into a cystic form and kind of can live in muscles and tissues for years.
<b>CG:</b>	For years.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes, and, um, sometimes penetrating those cysts is not easy, and I think that's why some, um, treating physicians are coming around to the idea of the longer term antibiotic therapy because on a short term, the, um, the, uh, organisms have a defensive reaction and they may go into cysts and lay low.  And then, you know, the person's done with their standard 2 or 3 weeks, which is what people had previously been giving and then, you know, sort of exert themselves again.  Something you might also find [PATIENT NAME] is that as you are on it over a period of time, from time to time, you may feel symptoms flaring up.  And that may not seem like it makes sense.  You know, you—
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, she, she did say—
<b>DR:</b>	With pain or, yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	I don't know if it was what she said or what we read.
<b>DR:</b>	It's called a jarisch herxheimer reaction.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And colloquially, you know, if you're on a chat board or, or in a support group, some of them might say I'm, I'm really herxing today.  It's a reference to that.  Um, it's not an extremely well understood phenomenon why everyone knows that it happens.  It used to happen in syphilis which is where it got the name.  Um, but, uh, it does seem to suggest that it is getting at the organisms and because the toxins are being released, that's why people are feeling the symptoms.  So—
<b>PT:</b>	What would the symptoms be?
<b>DR:</b>	It would probably be occasional periods of increased pain, possibly similar to when you had pain in the past, um, or those with more of the psychiatric issues, it could be a period of increased mood swings, um, increased depression.  Uh, often attention and concentration can be a concern, you know.  We've, uh, thought about attention deficient and treating that as well.  Um, sometimes those can worsen somewhat, um, and then out of the blue, they get much less.  So it sounds like you have a rheumatologist who's very well versed with the various approaches to treatment, and certainly IV is even more, um, risk—
<b>CG:</b>	Well she, she said it was also more difficult for, to get the insurance company to cover it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	So she said she wanted to go with, you know, say this didn't work, let's try that.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Exactly.  One real advantage is, you know, doxycycline is generic, inexpensive—
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And if you don't have to have an IV put in, you know, putting in an IV, though it can be done obviously very well and successfully, there's still an increased risk of exposure to infection just by penetrating the skin.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	So.  So good.  Okay 2 weeks, 2 weeks into it.  Have you noticed any changes in your appetite because you really look thinner to me, noticeably.
<b>CG:</b>	She's just not eating.
<b>DR:</b>	So that's not for the reason you'd like to be thinner.
<b>PT:</b>	I eat dinner.
<b>CG:</b>	Right, that's it.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I'm in bed during the day.
<b>DR:</b>	So it's very little appetite.  You're still in bed most of the day.
<b>CG:</b>	Very little activity.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Um, but you don't even want a snack at night.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I've been wanting to eat more, but—
<b>CG:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Lately, but the antibiotics [INAUDIBLE] it's hard to time anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Do the instructions you got from your rheumatologist say to take it with food?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	No.  On an empty stomach is preferable if you can manage that.  Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	It's a twice a day once in the morning, once at night.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and generally if you can, and I know it's not easy, but if you can take it an hour before, you know, up to an hour before or up to, you know, 2 hours or more after a meal, you should be fine.  So I don't know, you know, depending on your schedule, when you first wake up, you know, if you're able to wait an hour or so before having some breakfast, you know, that's a good time to take it.  Um, and if it upsets a person's stomach a lot, they can take it with food.  They can even take it once a day.  The important thing is to take it, you know.  In other words, you take both pills at the same time if your stomach can, can handle that.
<b>CG:</b>	Um, we also, well you recommended we go down on, what did we start?  We started the, what's it called?  Pristiq.
<b>DR:</b>	The Pristiq, yes, we were cross tapering—
<b>CG:</b>	Fifty mg of Pristiq.
<b>DR:</b>	Pristiq and the Effexor.
<b>CG:</b>	Right, and we lowered the, we're, we're at a steady state on that.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>CG:</b>	Fifty mg of Pristiq in the morning and 75 and 37.5 [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>CG:</b>	Of Effexor.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>CG:</b>	And we've been doing that consistently.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	So we haven't altered that at all.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	But her mood hasn't changed.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Not even, not even a blimp.
<b>PT:</b>	I think it's the Pristiq [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Because that sounds like that's a new phenomenon.  Hmm, let me see if there's any, um, I have some of the information that goes with the Pristiq and see if we've got any of the trial data suggesting that because, of course, it is relatively new.  I might go grab a package insert from the, uh, samples if I can't find one here.  Hang on just a second.  I know we've got some right in the cabinet.  It'll at least be good to see, I don't know if they'll compare it directly with Effexor, but see if there was a difference in that rate that people reported.  Be right back.  I'll spread them around because they don't, I don't think it's in the PDR yet, and you can just hold on to that for future reference if you like to peruse.
<b>CG:</b>	Well they all say dizziness.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but at least we'll know if it was something that was permanently reported.  Let's see.  Common side effects include nausea, headache, dry mouth, sweating, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, loss of appetite.  It sounds like you're even less inclined to eat now than previously, sleepiness, tiredness, diarrhea, vomiting.  I'm hearing more of the gastrointestinal side effects from, from people more so than dizziness, but again, obviously that's anecdotal and non scientific, um, tremor, dilated pupils and sexual side effects.  Okay, but they're not telling us the actual percentages that people reported.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I guess you could say I've had some diarrhea, but [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	When did that start?
<b>PT:</b>	Probably a year or more ago.
<b>CG:</b>	It's been a while.
<b>DR:</b>	One of the people I'm seeing who has lyme disease in addition to her, uh, psychiatric concerns, um, was first diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, and she would have, you know, bouts of severe constipation alternating with diarrhea, a lot of stomach pain.  Um, it's gradually gotten better, um, but it's been a little bit difficult to get a handle on everything that's happening because the doxycycline also made her a little nauseous.  So, but it sounds like you've been tolerating pretty well all these changes that have been going on.  Um, with, uh, taking the Pristiq, have you noticed the dizziness becoming, uh, changing at all during the time that you've been taking it?  In other words, does it, do you seem to be getting accommodated more or is it just a pretty constant, you know, every day it's there?
<b>PT:</b>	Pretty constant [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It might have been a little worse [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now I know today that, you know, this moment obviously is just a snapshot in the face of, you know, weeks since we last got together.  You're less tearful now than the last time I saw you.  Do you think that's true in general, or is it just the coincidence of, you know, at this particular time it's just not coming out that way?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] numb feeling.
<b>DR:</b>	Numb?  Is there a physiological numbness as well, any neurological, you know, numbness, tingling, waking up with numb limbs, anything like that?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	It's an emotional numbness.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just like [INAUDIBLE] crying.
<b>DR:</b>	Yep, and why is that?
<b>PT:</b>	Be safe.
<b>DR:</b>	You're worried about [NAME OTHER] being safe?
<b>PT:</b>	No—
<b>CG:</b>	She's safe with me.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yes, and is it that—
<b>CG:</b>	It's okay to cry when she's with me.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>CG:</b>	I think that's what she's trying to say.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, thank you.
<b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and that's exactly what's happening.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't cry all day in bed.  I try to sleep and I get frustrated when I can't sleep.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well you still are showing a lot of courage that despite feeling somewhat numb and hopeless and possibly pretty overwhelmed, you're still trying.  You're still taking the medicine.  You're giving the doxycycline a chance to work, and you're soldiering through a confusing and frustrating situation.  Nobody's 100% sure what's going on.  However, there are still leads and paths left to continue down.  So, I—
<b>CG:</b>	That's where I think I am, is what do we try next.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.  In a situation where the things that you're doing now are starting a journey that takes time.  If Pristiq does turn out to be an improvement over the Effexor, in the next few weeks we should know.  Um, right now it sounds like it's been about 6 weeks that you've been taking it, and having the reduced Effexor because we started, you know, right after our last appointment.  Um, you don't seem to be having a major—
<b>CG:</b>	We upped the Pristiq, didn't we [INAUDIBLE] before?
<b>DR:</b>	Um—
<b>CG:</b>	We upped it to 50.
<b>DR:</b>	I, I have that it started, I think it, it comes as a 50, unless were you able to divide it previously.
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, it was Abilify we, never mind.
<b>DR:</b>	That's right.
<b>CG:</b>	I'm confusing it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes, the Abilify [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	We talked about Effexor before, or, um, Pristiq before.
<b>DR:</b>	We've been talking about it for a while, exactly.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.  Sorry.
<b>DR:</b>	And then on the [DATE], no that's okay.  There's a lot to keep track of.  On the [DATE] I gave you the samples—
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And at that point lowered the Effexor.  Um, any reflections on the Abilify being out of the picture?  Um—
<b>CG:</b>	I don't see where the Abilify did much of anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and I think that's why frankly I think we kind of assumed that, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and, um, are you taking any Risperdal?
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I take it in the morning and at nighttime.
<b>CG:</b>	Fifty mg twice a day.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Which is kind of what we've been doing—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	For a while.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	We did double on the Trazodone at night.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  And are you sleeping at night?
<b>PT:</b>	Once I get to sleep [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and then it sounds like there's still a very strong desire to be in bed during the day.  Are you feeling physically exhausted and does it feel like, uh, you know, body just having a really hard time keeping going, or does it seem to be more of an emotional, you know, I just want to pull the covers up over my head, and yeah.  You're nodding there, so it sounds like maybe it's not as much physiological need you know, desire to just socially withdraw.
<b>CG:</b>	Sleep it away.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Everything seems too big to do.
<b>DR:</b>	You've suffered so much for so long.
<b>CG:</b>	I mean even the little things like she's never been one not to be clean and she doesn't want to take a shower.  It's hard to even get in the shower.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well that's the severe depression.  I mean you just don't even feel, I'm sure that you don't even feel like you have the energy to do the basics.  Any suicidal thoughts?
<b>PT:</b>	Not too bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I'm sure it's hard to keep going like this sometimes though.
<b>CG:</b>	There hasn't any daylight at all, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	No swing at all.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Totally [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  The depression has been very [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	[COUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	And [PATIENT NAME] how, how is your attention and concentration been?
<b>PT:</b>	Not real good.
<b>CG:</b>	I mean she still can't read a book.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so that's still—
<b>CG:</b>	She can watch a movie with me, but doesn't really get a lot out of it.
<b>DR:</b>	That's been going on for a long time.
<b>CG:</b>	Right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Like if I go down and turn the TV on, I can't decide what to watch.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Nothing really appeals.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and it's still a very prominent symptom.
<b>PT:</b>	And then my life is just like I'm not me, the me I remember.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  It's a terrible feeling.
<b>PT:</b>	But I kind of feel like it's like I'm never going to be right again.
<b>DR:</b>	Well I think it feels that way at the darkest time, you know, although it may sound old cliche, but the darkest time before the dawn, you know, because you've just been struggling for so long.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Definitely the longest bout.
<b>PT:</b>	[CRYING].  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	[CRYING].  The kids are going back to school and I feel bad that I, even in the morning, but I can't imagine doing it either.
<b>DR:</b>	I actually think that you made the best decision.  You have made the best decision for them.  I was talking with, um, one of my patients earlier, her mother was extremely depressed when she was growing up, and she was very, very isolated because her mother was so depressed that even the concept of making play dates or enrolling her in nursery school, it just would have been too much.  So she was a very lonely little girl who never got to spend time with other children, and who felt bad that, you know, there was her poor mother on the couch and, you know, she didn't, she didn't want to disturb her mother or bother her because she knew her mother didn't feel well, and she thought it might be partly her fault.  And, of course, it wasn't.  I mean there may have been a post, post partum piece to her mother's depression, but at least your kids are being with other kids and getting stimulation and doing the things that kids like to do, and then when they're home, you probably muster every last morsel of energy that you have to be the best that you can be with them.  So I think you're doing the right thing at this point, and when you feel better, and you're doing things together, they're going to remember those things were fun.  So, yeah, don't beat yourself up just for trying to get better, you know.  It's harder to get better, especially if you're feeling overwhelmed when there are decisions or a lot of stimulation.  You know, you're very wise to, to keep things quieter around the house.  [PATIENT NAME] did you and I ever talk about Strattera for the ADD, um, because I know you've tried most of the stimulants that are out there, and mixed results.  Um, there are a couple of attractive things about Strattera and I can give you some information if you want to think about it.  I've got some samples if you think you might want to try.  In some respects, the concept is similar to Pristiq and Effexor, but interestingly, this particular combination of, uh, neurotransmitter action seems to have a specially powerful effect on attention and concentration, some improvement in memory and some improvement in depression.  And I was thinking that as the Effexor phases out especially, the Strattera could work well along with the Pristiq and not be too much in terms of working in 2 ways with serotonin, um, and with, uh, norephrinephrine.  Um, it is not a stimulant and you would unlikely to have tics, you know, which seemed to happen with the Adderall, um, and with the, um, Concerta.  I remember you reporting, um, not feeling as jittery as on the Ritalin, but that being a very extended release, you also didn't feel much response with Concerta, you know, as you recalled at the time.  So that, again, could be something, because I'm thinking about what's getting you down in the day to day, and it does seem as though that there are certainly still some very prominent symptoms of depression and also the difficulty making decisions, you know, kind of feeling over bombarded by, by stimulation and, you know, um, hard to focus and, you know, even to read and focus and follow through on things.  So that could be another option to consider the Strattera even now.  If it turns out that whatever organisms may have gotten into you from that tick bite are implicated, you're going to start feeling better and better, and some people have very, very prominent psychiatric symptoms from the tick borne illnesses.  Um, but again, that's got to be frustrating because it would be great to have some glimmer that ah, we're on the right track, relief is around the bend.  I believe it, but unless you're feeling a change, it's got to be tough for you to believe it, you know, for how long you've suffered with this.  Did you end up going, I remember you were remarking that there is a, um, like a lyme disease institute clinic not too far from you.
<b>CG:</b>	We haven't gone there.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You have a rheumatologist who sounds pretty knowledgeable and that's a good plus.
<b>CG:</b>	She, she feels [INAUDIBLE] that was kind of the next step with the, I'd say the next step if the antibiotics don't help.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Infectious disease.
<b>DR:</b>	There can, there—
<b>CG:</b>	And I found the address and phone number.
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>CG:</b>	But I haven't called them yet.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  There's a—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Whether it's there or not.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, she was a little leery of some of the—
<b>DR:</b>	Really?  That's interesting.
<b>CG:</b>	Lyme centers.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.  There's a lot out there.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, in terms of what people are talking about.
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, dietary ideas.  Um, you know, light therapy, uh, controversial [INAUDIBLE] therapy with antibiotics.  You know and we were talking about how it can go into the cysts.  You know, some people talk about well take antibiotics for 3 weeks, stop for a week, go back on.  And there aren't a lot of good controlled studies that show whether that's more effective than just taking it for 2 or 3 months.  Um, so I, I think that's not the only thing going on probably.  Um, but it could play a pretty good role, but in the meantime you still have the symptoms that are really bothering you, and it would be just nice for you to be able to have fun.  How was vacation?  What ended up happening?
<b>PT:</b>	Well I was up more and—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	Doing more with them.
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	At least at night in the house without all our other projects [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	And different environment.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Where did you guys go?
<b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>CG:</b>	A friend has a condo in [DEIDENTIFIED] we rented.
<b>DR:</b>	That's great.
<b>CG:</b>	Um, she dreaded going, dreaded packing, and then kind of dreaded coming home.  So while we were there, maybe one day you stayed in.  2 days you stayed in.
<b>DR:</b>	That's great.
<b>CG:</b>	But other than that, she was pretty, pretty active.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  I mean she pushed though it.  You can tell she didn't really feel, she's a, always has been a beach person.
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.  Well I'm glad you didn't have to worry about, you know, the sunburn on the antibiotics at that point.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	It made sense to hold off.
<b>CG:</b>	It was a perfect week otherwise too.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, boy, whoever's down there today, I bet they had quite a show.
<b>CG:</b>	My boss' boss—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>CG:</b>	Went down over the weekend.
<b>DR:</b>	You can never be sure what's going to happen.
<b>CG:</b>	And is Strattera short acting?  It's like in a couple of days you'd know it's working.  That's the ones I hate, the ones that take 2 to 3 months to tell.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, this is, the results are not as immediate as with the stimulant, but most people get a sense within the first couple of weeks whether they're on the right track.
<b>PT:</b>	I actually feel like I don't, other things are so bad, I don't care that much about them.
<b>DR:</b>	What, the attention deficient?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I mean, I'm surviving and I don't have anything to pay attention to.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm on so many, I'm on so many pills now.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] but then—
<b>CG:</b>	I'm with her.  What do we do with the depression?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Do we start taking the Effexor all the way away or just totally switch course and do something different?
<b>DR:</b>	It concerns me about the dizziness that you're having with the Pristiq.  That's why I'm not, at this point, quite ready to say let's double the Pristiq.
<b>CG:</b>	All right, and of course, you don't want to take a person off an antidepressant when they're really depressed either.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  Here would be an alternative approach, which is still continuing with the basic principles that we've been following.  It actually wouldn't be unreasonable to increase your Risperdal a bit.  Risperdal does have, we know it has anti bipolar effects, and it also can have the ability to augment the antidepressant medication to be more effective.  So—
<b>PT:</b>	I thought you were concerned about the Risperdal because [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	A little bit.  Also with, um, the weight issues and so forth, but at this point, at least in terms of trying to come out of the depression, if you felt better about things, and were interested in anything, even eating, I think even a, a short term small weight gain is not going to put you at long term risk.  Eventually if the Risperdal can be cut down or phased out, that would probably be the most desirable thing.  Then again though, if we learn that it can be really helpful, it's nice to know it's out there to have in your back pocket, you know, if you need to, to go back to it, and 1 mg a day is not that much.  And maybe, you know, I haven't been as, as willing to let it do more just in terms of trying to stay conservative with the long view, but like you say, the short view feels terrible, really terrible.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, you can see long view.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, and so to have an interest in something, you know, a reason to get out of bed, a reason to watch TV, um, I think it's reasonable to increase the Risperdal, and I think you can go down another 37.5 with the Effexor also.  If we take away some Effexor and put some Risperdal in, I think we're upping something that's more likely to be effective.  Yeah, because you're right, I'd certainly not want to pull the rug out from under someone who's depressed or on an antidepressant, um, and it's somewhat encouraging, perhaps the dizziness is a little better, not as bad as in the beginning, and perhaps since the Effexor's withdrawn, that will improve.  I think there are a lot of people out there right now cross tapering the 2.  Um, so—
<b>CG:</b>	We'll go up to a mg twice a day.
<b>DR:</b>	You could do that, or, um, you could take a full mg at bedtime, stay with the half in the morning.  I'm trying to avoid it making you tired when you first wake up.  Um, and with the lorazepam, how many times a day?
<b>CG:</b>	Three.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Three.
<b>DR:</b>	Any panic breaking through?
<b>CG:</b>	Any what?
<b>DR:</b>	Any panic breaking through?  Severe anxiety.
<b>CG:</b>	The panic's still there.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm not hearing panic attacks.
<b>PT:</b>	It's more internal.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, turmoil.
<b>PT:</b>	Internal.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, like an internal turmoil anxiety kind of ruminating.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know, but when I try to make myself take a shower or something or do something, even when he asks me to, you know, help with dinner, I just, um, I feel anxious and like no I can't do this.
<b>DR:</b>	Why do you think you might be thinking that?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Is it you don't have the energy or you're going to mess it up, or, I'm just trying, trying to get a—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] energy, usually things I can't really mess up.  I don't want to do them.
<b>DR:</b>	Is it a lack of self confidence?
<b>PT:</b>	I have lost a lot of self confidence.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just an obsession sort of thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Tell me more about that obsession.
<b>PT:</b>	Something about doing it right or just being overwhelmed.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That can be a big piece of attention deficient too.  Uh, sometimes, I'll just use an example, there can be a house that's an absolute disaster area in terms of clutter, right, and a person with attention deficient disorder may look at and it's like looking at TV screen with static.  There's so much you almost can't even say okay, I'm just going to do one bureau drawer today or whatever, but if there's a little project that's interesting, or you know, might involve some creativity or ingenuity, the person might spend hours on that.  You know, and it's usually more of something that the person likes to do like oh, you know, that curtain really needs, uh, you know, the, the length changed, and then the person may be there sewing a curtain, and you know, they're surrounded.  They can't even move in the room because there's so much stuff, but the curtain is the thing that the person ends up zeroing in on.  Now or in better times, has that kind of thing ever happened to you?
<b>PT:</b>	I guess.
<b>DR:</b>	Because you mentioned a lot of projects around the house that are sort of sitting there unfinished.  Whose projects are they?
<b>PT:</b>	I see more mine, but I know there's something there of [NAME OTHER] something to do.
<b>DR:</b>	Tell me about your—
<b>PT:</b>	And I've given up on stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	For a while, and now part of the problem is I don't feel like I have any work sort of.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe no interest in the work right now—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Too because the depression is so bad.  Tell me about the projects that are in process.  I'm going to say in process because I believe you're going to finish them sometime.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  There's scrap booking stuff that I even imagine touching.
<b>DR:</b>	Where is it now?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Is it like on a desk in a certain room or in a box or several different places around the house?
<b>PT:</b>	They're in all different places.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How would it be to find 1 big box or Tupperware container or whatever, put it all in there, label it scrap booking stuff, finish later and get it out of the way, just out from under foot.  You're not throwing it away.  You're not giving up.  It's just now is not the time.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't do it.
<b>DR:</b>	What if [NAME OTHER] helped?  Put it in the box and just, you know, all this stuff is sitting around here reminding you of what you're not doing, and it's not pressing.  It doesn't have to be done now.  It could be done on a rainy day some day in the future, even way in the future, but you probably just don't need it staring you in the face every day, and making you feel worse about what, what's not getting done.  So even though I can certainly understand with the depression you might not have the motivation to put it in the box.  Do you think it would be helpful to consolidate those 4 places into one place that's out of sight, and hopefully out of mind for a little while because you feel guilty about enough right now.
<b>PT:</b>	[CRYING].  When I talk about stuff like that, when I was seeing the therapist and talk about stuff like that, and I just feel worse.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[CRYING].  Because I can't make myself do it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Is it, um, even thinking about putting it away is too much?  Yeah.  Do you feel like those projects are under foot and in the way?
<b>CG:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  As long as you let them—
<b>CG:</b>	Well—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	Did it bother me to the point where I, I need to spend attention on it, no.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Do they need attention, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm just thinking in terms of—
<b>CG:</b>	But—
<b>DR:</b>	A logistical—
<b>CG:</b>	But in the scheme of everything else that's going on, it's, it's hard to get to it.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	He doesn't have any time because he's doing everything now.
<b>CG:</b>	I'm grocery shopping at 6:00 in the morning—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Or 10:00 at night.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>CG:</b>	Um, then I'm just struggling to survive.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	And cleaning up the house is not, I mean we have a housecleaner that comes in and does the basics.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, can you move around in each room as much as you need to, and I'm just saying this from the perspective of someone whose home office can get so bad that you can't move freely in the office.  If I'm in one corner, one of my kids might come in and, and be tripping on stuff.
<b>CG:</b>	I mean there's room enough to not—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>CG:</b>	Knock things over.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, so, um—
<b>CG:</b>	It's not, it's not like, um, pictures I've on the TV show where somebody's—
<b>DR:</b>	It's not a safety hazard.
<b>CG:</b>	Obsessive compulsive and has—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	The last 15 years of newspapers.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>CG:</b>	It's cluttered.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Agreed, but it's functional.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Then functional is a success.
<b>CG:</b>	I mean the paperwork [INAUDIBLE] I'm not filing things—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>CG:</b>	There's paid bills in a box, but and I look at them in a few years.
<b>DR:</b>	And when the kids need to do projects, they can reasonably—
<b>CG:</b>	Well, reasonably.  Well, their desks are basically what we left them when school was over, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	That needs to be addressed, but and the desks are not in the optimal place.  They're in the dining room.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	And there's too many toys to put them where they need to be in another place, but—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	There's a lot of work to be done—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	But I don't feel like it's even worth trying to start.
<b>DR:</b>	"Is there anything that the kids could decide for themselves?  Like are they at a stage in their lives where they can say oh, this book is babyish.  I'm done with it, or I don't need this train anymore.	"
<b>CG:</b>	Yes, but with supervision.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	And honestly, I've been trying to spend as much time with them at home with [PATIENT NAME OTHER] and the kids.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>CG:</b>	I don't want to—
<b>PT:</b>	He spends a lot of time.
<b>CG:</b>	Cleaning up the weekend, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Spend the weekend cleaning up the garage.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm thinking what they can do that benefits them, you know what I mean.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Like if they say, I can't do my homework on this desk because it's all full of my toys.
<b>CG:</b>	Right, right, right.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, you could go are there any of those that you don't need anymore?  You could even have like a charity bin, you know, an old clothes hamper or something.
<b>CG:</b>	We've been talking about doing a yard sale.  We just haven't gotten to it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yard sales are a heck of a lot of work.
<b>CG:</b>	And we started piling things in a pile in the garage for a yard sale, but we haven't done it.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you need the money?
<b>CG:</b>	Sure.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, because I'll just make one observation.
<b>CG:</b>	It's probably just worth throwing them or donating them.
<b>DR:</b>	Well there are charities that will come to your house and pick it up.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And then you leave a receipt for a tax deduction.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, there's the American Cancer Research Center, who are very reliable and they come.  They like household items, clothing.  They're not as big on the toys, but, but there can be a role for that.  Um, and then, you know—
<b>CG:</b>	Most of the toys probably aren't worth saving, it's just get rid of them.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um, you know, there are a half dozen places that will sometimes just, they can come to your house and, you know, you don't have another huge project looming on you.  You know, a yard sale can definitely be worth doing.  Um, but there's a lot to do.  There's a program called Clean House on the Style Network.  I don't know if you get that network with your, uh, package.
<b>CG:</b>	We've seen it.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, interesting.  Yeah, just to, to see all the different things that people think about stuff and what it means to them and what happens at the yard sales and such, um, and once in a while there's a decent decorating or organizing idea in there.  And I think it's been one of our sessions before that we've talked about there are a lot of options out there for treating depression including AZT, you know.  That is not completely impossible or out of the question.  Getting you relief is an absolutely top priority, um, and I have a feeling this is one of those dark periods most likely before the dawn starts breaking.  You know, there are a couple of unturned stones even here.  The Strattera is a possibility because the attentional issues are still definitely in the picture.  Um, I think the doxycycline is doing its work.  So anything that's been lingering and lurking and causing static, you know, let's wipe that right off the map, you know.  Plaquenil has applications in, both in the long term in the logic situation and fighting infectious disease, which is fantastic to know.  Um—
<b>CG:</b>	So I hear 1 mg of Risperdal—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	At night, and lower the Effexor by 37.5.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes, exactly, and I would suggest keeping separate the Pristiq and the Effexor now, now that we're going to the once a day.  In other words, if you usually take the Pristiq in the morning—
<b>CG:</b>	She takes them all at once right now.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Any chance that you could take the new dose of Effexor later in the day?  Like you take the Risperdal twice a day, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So you can take—
<b>CG:</b>	Take the Effexor at night?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Have you tried that?  I don't know if you've tried that before.
<b>DR:</b>	One in the morning—
<b>CG:</b>	Take the Effexor at night?
<b>DR:</b>	One at night.  Yeah.  Spread them out.
<b>CG:</b>	Pristiq in the morning and Effexor at night.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Or Effexor in the morning, Pristiq at night if you're afraid Pristiq makes you a little dizzy, you know, it's better to be dizzy when you're in bed and then trying to sleep.  Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	I mean we've taken, before we were doing, well they were 150, we were taking 1 in the morning and 1 at night.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Effexor.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] at night.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	I like the idea of Pristiq in the morning, or Pristiq at night and Effexor in the morning.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, and minimize any contribution of that dizziness to taking the wind out of your sails during the day.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] started this, but—
<b>CG:</b>	Go ahead.
<b>PT:</b>	[CRYING].  No, it's not, it's not the wind taking [INAUDIBLE] out of my sails.
<b>CG:</b>	She doesn't have any sails.
<b>PT:</b>	[CRYING].  My sails are broken.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[CRYING].  And I just, and I feel really resistant to the things you say.  I said I can't do it, but I just, I can barely take a shower without [NAME OTHER] kind of pushing me along and I can't usually get out of bed till he gets home.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b>	Most evenings we're spending is us on the couch watching TV with her laying with her head in my lap.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Does that feel good?
<b>CG:</b>	Sometimes.
<b>PT:</b>	[CRYING].  Yeah, I'll say sometimes [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	Wrapped in a blanket with her stroking her hair, and we watched the Olympics which was fun.
<b>DR:</b>	The Olympics were fantastic this year.
<b>CG:</b>	And then, then we went from convention to convention.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Which is kind of depressing.
<b>PT:</b>	And I just watch what he wants to watch.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I mean she's actually learning baseball.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, actually there's a lot that's interesting going on in baseball.
<b>CG:</b>	Well it's kind of, um, I guess therapeutic is the way I, I, I enjoy it.  It relaxes me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and the kids like it?  They can watch it with you?
<b>CG:</b>	Well the kids, the kids are usually in the other room watching cartoons or something.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Or playing their video game or something else.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] coming back and forth.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, and we will watch together like the Antique Road show or Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader.
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  That's good.
<b>CG:</b>	Deal or No Deal now.
<b>DR:</b>	You watch pretty good quality stuff.
<b>CG:</b>	And we try to keep [INAUDIBLE].  It's hard.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, unfortunately I don't spend as much time I should be with them.  I'm trying to comfort [PATIENT NAME].
<b>DR:</b>	But you know what, you're setting examples—
<b>CG:</b>	I'm trying to balance.
<b>DR:</b>	Of how a couple supports each other.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  I, yeah, understood.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, so and they have each other too.  That's wonderful that you have 2, you know.  That's one of the great things about having more than 1 child.  So, and when you get to a point where there is something you want to watch, you know, true, you're watching what [NAME OTHER] wants to watch, but you're spending time together.  You're learning about something new.  That's good.
<b>CG:</b>	And, and we stay away from the kind of thing that seem to bother her.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	You know, like, I mean I don't think you even care if you get lost in a baseball game.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>CG:</b>	But I'm, I'm, I've been surprised.  You know, I'll put the kids to bed and come back and she'll tell me what's happened.
<b>DR:</b>	Good job.  Well that's great.
<b>CG:</b>	She's learning the rules too.
<b>DR:</b>	And that's a nice thing.  Sports are straightforward, and there's skill and athleticism.
<b>CG:</b>	Well and baseball's nice and—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	It's easygoing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That's the great American game.
<b>CG:</b>	That's my favorite.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So, you know, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	Well, I would, I would say you give us the Strattera.  I mean we can sample it—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>CG:</b>	If things gets a little brighter or—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'll give you some information.
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] give it a whirl.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, um—
<b>CG:</b>	And we'll do these 4 things.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well I think it's going to happen, [PATIENT NAME], it's just that of everything that's out there for ADD, it's the most antidepressant like, and you sure are suffering from your depression symptoms, no question.  So we could kind of hit it from a couple of angles.
<b>PT:</b>	I guess I feel like—
<b>CG:</b>	Nothing's working.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, like [INAUDIBLE] not working.
<b>DR:</b>	And in a way we are.  I think what might seem a little counter intuitive because you're probably feeling like ah, I could just be done with all of this stuff.
<b>CG:</b>	And we thought of just not taking anything.
<b>DR:</b>	It's better to come off the Effexor gradually.  This we know from years of experience.  Um, you're under enough stress and having enough anxiety, you don't need to experience that terrible feeling that a person experiences going cold turkey off the Effexor, you know.  It may seem arduous and drawn out, but I'm sure it's better this way, just going down 37.5 at a time.  So, you know, and, and if Pristiq bombs out, there are other things we can think about.  Absolutely, you know.  Risperdal should help.  Strattera could help on 2 fronts, and any underlying infection that's there that's getting treated.  So, the frustrating part is sometimes it takes a while and during this, this whole course of us looking at different things, we've kind of been able to rule things out.  You don't miss the Abilify that much.  You don't need it, you know.  Um, there probably was a time where you'd be amazed to think you could ever consider coming off Effexor, but you are considering that very seriously, and you don't feel a whole lot worse.  It would be great to feel better, but at least it isn't as if, you know, you're just feeling like the Effexor's going down and, you know, the depression is just absolutely rampant.  It's frustrating, but you're doing what you need to do.
<b>CG:</b>	Fast acting antidepressant that works.
<b>PT:</b>	That was the Effexor [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, it wasn't really fast acting.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but within a week I had started to feel better.
<b>DR:</b>	Well if it's throwing up roadblocks to the Pristiq, then as the Effexor becomes less in the picture, Pristiq might fill that role.  It certainly is the closest thing that's out there to Effexor.  So—
<b>PT:</b>	Well maybe that's why it's not working either.  Wouldn't I feel something different already?  I've been on it for you said 6 weeks.
<b>DR:</b>	About 6 weeks, yeah.  It can take 2 to 3 months even before we know everything that an antidepressant designed like this can do, and you know, my hope is that the other piece of the Effexor molecule, maybe that's been what's interfering.  Hard to say, but that was the experience of some people switching from Celexa to Lexapro, for example.  You know, the piece of the molecule we ended up being able to dispense with, was getting the way for some people.  For a few others, that was a piece they liked having because it did make them feel more tired, more calmed down, better appetite.  There are a few people looking for that, you know.  Most other people who are depressed are like I can really live without those pieces of it.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know.  Well everybody's unique, and it's probably going to be that we'll find the unique thing that works for you, you know, but just surviving every day, that's enough.  You're doing enough.
<b>CG:</b>	I like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And then—
<b>PT:</b>	And then you talked about doing other stuff.
<b>CG:</b>	Later.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, eventually.  Nothing, you know, you did talk about, you know, just seeing the projects around, feeling depressed having them around.  Um, none of those are pressing.  None of them have to happen right now, and if getting them out of sight would be helpful, you could do it, but it sounds like you can get around okay in your house, I just don't want you heaping guilt on yourself, you know.  That's the thing.  So if seeing them is depressing because oh gosh, that's another thing I haven't done, you might want to consider just, you know, if scrapbook in 4 places, maybe just getting it in 1 place, putting a lid on the box, closing the door.  You can do that sometime when it seems fun again, you know.  But it's probably not going to be fun right now.  I guess there would be 2 areas if you do start to feel better to look at.  One is, is there a way to be more physically active.  I know it's got to be really hard to even thinking about wanting to get outside, walk around.  The days are getting shorter.  Um, the sun's not going to be as much of a problem, and just getting out, even if it's just walking around the block is very therapeutic.  So if there's an extra molecule of energy and it doesn't seem like it would be total misery inducing that would be one thing.  The other thing is if there's anything out there, if you are feeling better and having a little more energy, that just is something that you can see I did something even if it's a tiny something, even if you have a tomato plant that grows one tomato once a year and you see the tomato and it's ripe for plucking.  You pluck it.  I made a difference.  It was there.  Now it's here and I'm going to eat it.  You know, anything that says you have control over some things no matter how small.  If anything like that presents itself, it's worth doing.  That's why some, you know, scientists working on long term projects love gardening because you do the weeding and it looks good, or some people love cooking.  You know, I took this, this egg that's in the shell and I made this omelet.  You know, I've changed it and I enjoyed that process.  If there is anything like that for you that's very achievable and it's not likely to turn into a project that then makes you feel guilty if you're not able to see it all the way through, it's worth considering, you know, and not that you're what you like to do, but if anything like that did present itself.  So—
<b>CG:</b>	"Okay.	"
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  Let me get some of the Strattera together, and also some information just so you can think it over.  There's a nice kit they have.  [INAUDIBLE] yeah, an educational program, and it gives you a [INAUDIBLE] teenagers.  There will no quiz.  It's just information and if you don't get to it, that's okay.  All right, just a second and I'll go grab some samples.  I can get you a bag for those.
<b>CG:</b>	Keep hanging in there.
<b>DR:</b>	Now the thing I'm keeping in mind, you know, we pointed out [PATIENT NAME] is there are quite a few medicines in the picture right now, and I wouldn't want you to, you know, get no side effects or anything, but this is more of kind of a visual illustration and, you know, I'll send you home with these.
<b>CG:</b>	Oh boy.
<b>DR:</b>	These are the strengths it comes in, okay.  I'm just showing that not to overwhelm, but just to give you a sense that we have a number of different, um, strengths.  Um, some of the literature you read may say the adult dose starts robustly somewhere up there, right.  I'm going to give extra 10s just so that you can take your time, work your way up if you want to, um—
<b>CG:</b>	Where do we start with just 10?
<b>DR:</b>	Ten, one a day.  Yeah, your basic once a day deal.
<b>CG:</b>	Is it long relief, long release or—
<b>DR:</b>	Once a day is all you need to do, and then if things are going well, people usually take it in the morning.
<b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	But there may be the occasional person who says well this really relaxes and I'd just rather take it at night.  That's fine.  Um, if things are going—
<b>CG:</b>	No, I'm going, yeah, I'm not even going to consider it until the depression [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, sure, which is very reasonable, um, because like you're saying right now, you don't feel that interested in doing anything and, you know, attention deficient is when you're, you're trying to get something accomplished and you're not able to do it.  Here it's hard to even find that you enjoy doing.  So—
<b>CG:</b>	I mean this is going to sound strange, but you don't want to be, you don't have more attention when you're depressed.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	I don't think, right?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it's hard to say.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] the depression.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.  That's because the depression [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Because of the kind of medicine this is, it could.  So say increasing the Risperdal is not panning out.  We've talked on the phone.  You're feeling really hopeless.  It's not beyond the realm of reasonable minds to think this could augment a depression strategy too, and by the way, improve the attention deficient.  So say that you took—
<b>PT:</b>	Would there be something that would help, more than likely to help with depression?
<b>DR:</b>	The Risperdal.  The Risperdal, and if there's underlying [INAUDIBLE] is treating that.  So you're just about to do both of those things.  You've already got the treatment under way for the—
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] the Effexor.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, exactly, and you know, phasing out the Effexor.  So say you took 10 mg for a week, no bad results, can't tell if they're good results yet, you could go to 18 the next week.  Still unsure, go to 25.  If there's no reason not to take it, go ahead and take it.  And it could have a synergistic effect with what you're taking, a boosting effect.  So, so, I'll go ahead and package these for you.
<b>CG:</b>	Twenty—five.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] 50.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] yeah.  Kind of a sense of what's out there and what doses people work towards and so forth because some of the adult literature you, you read it may suggest starting higher, but remember they're focusing on treating attention deficient, and the studies were done almost always when this is the only thing the person's taking.  So they're not able to take into account, you know, a person has a long history with the Effexor was initially helpful, no longer helpful, being cut back, you know.  I'm much more interested in how [PATIENT NAME] feels than, you know, the average adult not taking anything else starts with 25 or, you know, 40.  So I'll send those with you—
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And you've got some information as well, and let me take a look, when would be good for us to meet again?  I think a month or so could be okay.  Um, does that sound, you know, give this new change a chance to kick in.
<b>CG:</b>	I would think so.
<b>DR:</b>	You can just, okay.
<b>CG:</b>	We need to get back—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, somewhat more regular visits.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  No, that is the, um, rheumatologist about how the doxycycline is going.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>CG:</b>	Because I don't know how we're going to know if it's working or not.
<b>DR:</b>	And I can collaborate with that person.
<b>CG:</b>	I guess we do another blood test and see if the level changes.  I don't know.  I don't know what, what the marker, if there is marker, or what the marker is.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, if there's not a test, then [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] negative it should have been positive.
<b>CG:</b>	Right, but how do we know it's working or not.  We don't.
<b>DR:</b>	She is looking though at things like C reactive protein and other autoimmune markers.  There may be clued there because they're, they're getting better on zeroing in on some of the corollary things also.  So, um, how would [DATE] at 5:00 be?
<b>CG:</b>	That's okay with me.
<b>DR:</b>	That sounds okay.  All right, would you like me to write that on a card?
<b>CG:</b>	No, I got it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, you got one of those Palm Pilot things.  Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] [PHYSICIAN NAME].
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	Can you put it on the calendar at home?
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Okay, then give me the card.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Because I won't remember.
<b>DR:</b>	That'll be your reminder to put it on the calendar.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Good thinking.  So that's [DATE] at 5:00 pm.  All righty, there you go.
<b>CG:</b>	All righty.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well, I will look forward to seeing you again.
<b>CG:</b>	If anything changes we'll give you a call.
<b>DR:</b>	Definitely.
<b>CG:</b>	Thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay, you take care now; I'll see you next time.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
