BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> And you get to keep that.  So you were saying, what's up with court?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I asked for, um, I asked to be put in a program and have, be drug tested, um, so I could kind of clean myself up.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Like, I didn't have to.  I was just under supervision, but I asked him, I'm like, "Can you have it a court order that I go to some program, some, do something and be tested, so I can't do anything?"
<b>DR:</b> So you asked your probation or parole officer -
<b>PT:</b> My lawyer.
<b>DR:</b> Your lawyer to have him ask the court.
<b>PT:</b> Because the ruling was on Thursday.  And it was a negotiated plea.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I asked him to put that as part of it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> To go get drug tested.
<b>PT:</b> Therefore, um, I don't know, like, what exactly that requires -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But, um -
<b>DR:</b> So what did you plead guilty to?
<b>PT:</b> Possession of cannabis.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Was the lesser of the 2.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, it says, "File within 45 days with the clerk of this court a written drug evaluation signed by any therapist approved for practice by any Illinois Government agency and file with the clerk of this court."  Um, so really it's just a drug evaluation.  What does that entail?
<b>DR:</b> Well, I know Michael Phelps might be getting one of those, too, these days.  You see the picture of him doing the bong?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I saw that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that cost him $5 million.
<b>PT:</b> Well, it only cost me $700.00.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but he didn't get caught except by someone with a camera there, I suppose.  But, uh, it's the thought that counts.  Um, well, they probably want some kind of a signature on some paper.
<b>PT:</b> Does that mean I have to be tested?
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> Because I'm not going to be clean for at least a month and a half, anyway.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  Well -
<b>PT:</b> Well, that's how much THC is in my, my body and cocaine.
<b>DR:</b> Well, but the, you can measure any level.  The cocaine should be out in about 3 days.
<b>PT:</b> Um, that was, uh, 2 days ago.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh -
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Marijuana, if you get a quantitative level, hopefully, you can measure and watch it go down.
<b>PT:</b> So what do I have to do to, um, get through this?
<b>DR:</b> Well, let's see what you got.
<b>PT:</b> Meaning, I don't really want to do it, but I figured I should because I don't want to blow my supervision.
<b>DR:</b> It, best way, are you still with Cigna?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> With Cigna Insurance then -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I will be going to school starting in March.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Does that affect that at all or -
<b>PT:</b> Um, I'm not sure how that affects it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, drug evaluation -
<b>PT:</b> What does that mean?
<b>DR:</b> Well, there are different ideas of what the court thinks is a drug evaluation.  Um, I mean like, for the DUI program, we have a sort of comprehensive drug evaluation legal kind of form needs, go through.
<b>PT:</b> So there's really a window for me to slip out of this, isn't there?
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Not that I'm going to, but there is some -
<b>DR:</b> You say, "Slip out."  What do you mean by that?
<b>PT:</b> Like, I can start using again within a matter of time.  This is only day 2 of my sober days.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, I'm glad you're sober.  That's positive.
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to school; it has to be.
<b>DR:</b> Day 2 of sobriety.  Yeah.  Okay.  How's your mood doing?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not too good.
<b>DR:</b> Is it up and down?
<b>PT:</b> It's mostly depressed or angry.  Frustration at work.  I got kicked out of work yesterday because I was giving my manager a hard time and she's like, "You know what, just go home."  I'm like, "All right.  Sure."
<b>DR:</b> Tough day at [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's going to be another one tonight.  I got to be there at 3:00.
<b>DR:</b> Now, you still on Seroquel?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, no.  I haven't been taking the Seroquel.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> What are you taking now?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, Effexor -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Two in the morning and then I take 2 Lyrica at night.  They're 75's.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you get 150 of Lyrica at night and Effexor, you take 300 in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> Right?
<b>PT:</b> Um, the samples that I received were 75's, so I just took 2 at night.
<b>DR:</b> Samples of what, Effexor?
<b>PT:</b> Lyrica.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, Lyrica.  Okay.  And how about Seroquel, you're not taking that at all?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> For the bipolar stuff?  No.
<b>PT:</b> Thank God.  I also heard on the news that it's being, uh, investigated for a bunch of crap.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, they're always investigating stuff, bunch of crap.  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> Stuff I don't want.
<b>DR:</b> Um -
<b>PT:</b> I don't want -
<b>DR:</b> Like weight gain.
<b>PT:</b> Weight gain either -
<b>DR:</b> Diabetes, cholesterol increases or cataracts.
<b>PT:</b> They said something about pancrea, pancreatitis; pancreas failure -
<b>DR:</b> Huh -
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's kind of -
<b>PT:</b> There was something o, osis, some kind of, I don't remember.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Um, it was on the news.
<b>DR:</b> When did you stop the Seroquel?
<b>PT:</b> I haven't taken Seroquel in days and days and days and days.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Probably 2 weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Hop on the scales; see what you weigh.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I probably gained weight.  I know I've gained weight.  One seventy.
<b>DR:</b> One seventy.  Okay.  Um-hum.  Well, how are you doing otherwise?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I just to want to go to school.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Still smoking cigarettes?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> How much?
<b>PT:</b> Um, almost a pack a day.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Almost.  Um, I'm going to school in [DEIDENTIFIED] at the [DEIDENTIFIED]Â -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Starting [DATE].  And I have my, um, Associate in Applied Sciences in 18 months and my certification.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Going to graduate.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Well, it's not really college, but it's something I want to do.  I'm just concerned because it's been really hard for me to not use.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Like, way hard.  And I'm just afraid that I'm going to go back to it because I really want to, but I also know that.  It's a trick.  Like, uh, once you're there, but I feel a little bit better when I'm not using.  I feel more awake, but -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, you've tried a number of medicines.  How do you feel that this present combination is working for you?
<b>PT:</b> It's okay.
<b>DR:</b> Feel okay with it?
<b>PT:</b> It's all right.
<b>DR:</b> Getting some sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  When I wasn't, when I wasn't doing coke, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So going to give up the cocaine?
<b>PT:</b> I really like it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I like mixing it with weed.
<b>DR:</b> Mixing it with what?
<b>PT:</b> With marijuana.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> It's the best.
<b>DR:</b> Just some, uh, juiced up weed there, huh?
<b>PT:</b> No, actual cocaine and then you smoke the weed.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Something to raise me up, then I smoke to come down and then I bring up and then I smoke to come down.
<b>DR:</b> Why don't you ride an elevator instead?
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Because it's not as pleasuring.
<b>DR:</b> No.  It's like up and down the wall.  A button is down, you know, if we put electrodes in your brain in the right spot, we can just press the buttons and give you the same feelings.
<b>PT:</b> Sweet.
<b>DR:</b> You'd like that, huh?  Uh -
<b>PT:</b> I just find it hard to find anything pleasurable, so I don't want to do anything.  And I get very frustrated.  And the fact that I know I'm not going to be able to use afterwards makes me even more frustrated, that I've got nothing to come out of it with; pisses me off.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know, in this drug evaluation, it started out by saying, "This patient has, uh, been using cocaine and marijuana on a fairly regular basis the past couple of years.  She is sober 2 days now."
<b>PT:</b> That doesn't sound like much, does it?
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know -
<b>PT:</b> I don't know what to do.  It's kind of like, if I stop, it's, great things happen, but I feel like crap and if I keep using, I feel, I feel relieved and much better, but it makes life crappy.
<b>DR:</b> So do you think you'd use cocaine, marijuana the rest of your life?
<b>PT:</b> I hope not.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to.
<b>DR:</b> So what do you think would change?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I have to want to change.  That's the hard part.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> Because I kind of do and I kind of really don't.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Like, uh, some people, they say they, uh, like smoking.  They don't want to give it up and then they say, "Oh, by the way, can you check me for my cholesterol?  Make sure there's not side effects on these, uh, medicines or something."  So how about the side effects from your smoking?
<b>PT:</b> I'd rather smoke weed and do coke than smoke cigarettes.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But they all kind of go hand in hand.
<b>DR:</b> Sort of.
<b>PT:</b> I can't drink because that just makes me feel sick.  So now I don't know what I'm going to do.
<b>DR:</b> Tough decision.
<b>PT:</b> I kind of already made it, in a sense.  I started on the right path to making it.  And then I'm starting to go back to school because I'm ready to quit that job any day now, if -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not fired first.  But I need money, 34 grand for school, yeah.  I already am bankrupt and I owe collectors.  My credit is going to go down the shitter.  Yeah, I want to do drugs.  I can't do it.  I have to be [INAUDIBLE].  And if you ever saw the movie, "Blow," it didn't turn out very good.
<b>DR:</b> Well, there is a lot of hazards to doing drugs.
<b>PT:</b> And if I cared about myself more, I would care about what's going in my body.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Are you willing to take a urine drug screen at some point?
<b>PT:</b> Do I only need to take 1?
<b>DR:</b> Well, it'd be nice to get another one.  What you should do is, uh, you should get a urine drug screen and make it a quantitative one for marijuana.  So let's say, urine drug screen with, uh, quantitative -
<b>PT:</b> I know it sounds horrible, but when can I smoke again?
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Well, the whole point is then they'll say, well, she's clean for 2 days, she's just doing this until the court thing is over, then she wants to smoke again.  See, that doesn't look good.  It's like her motivation to stop using is very tenuous at best.  She's just doing it to placate the court, even though she realizes there's a problem.  That's why she said put it in.
<b>PT:</b> That's why I did it.  I didn't have to do this.
<b>DR:</b> I know, but you're trying to say you need daddy to watch you.
<b>PT:</b> Well, it's either that or the judge will just know I'm going to break my supervision, just going to keep doing it.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Well, so they weren't going to be drug testing you?
<b>PT:</b> Whatever that court order says is what I'm doing, so -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So let me just figure out what they are saying.  So what do you have to do, do you have to do it on the swab?
<b>PT:</b> They didn't say.
<b>DR:</b> "Community service," anyway; paying fine.  Hang on to that.  Um, "Presence waived."  Uh, "Release if in full compliance of the court's order."
<b>PT:</b> You mean, so they didn't even want me to go into a program?
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I guess it means you don't have to come back.
<b>PT:</b> To you?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  "Must pay $100.00 lab fee."
<b>PT:</b> I paid that already.
<b>DR:</b> Lab fee for what?
<b>PT:</b> Um, to test the substance that they found on me.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.  "And $200.00 statutory [INAUDIBLE]."
<b>PT:</b> They have to order me to be drug tested, correct?
<b>DR:</b> Have to?
<b>PT:</b> Like, I don't understand what I have to do.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it doesn't look like much.  Other than, within 45 days your lawyer has to file a written drug evaluation.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING], which would pretty much be -
<b>DR:</b> It's going to make you look like you like to use marijuana and cocaine.  And right now as it stands, been using marijuana for more than 2 years as a daily user and uses cocaine episodically when she can get it.  Likes the combination of the 2, feels that it helps her, makes her feel better and doesn't really want to quit.  She's not compliant with some of her other psychiatric medicines, takes herself on and off.
<b>PT:</b> That's not true.  It was maybe like a year ago, but I've been very good with that because I feel sick if I don't, and who wants to feel like shit?
<b>DR:</b> Um, but you're doing all right with the Lyrica and the Effexor now and your mood is a little more stable.  You do seem more stable, so that's good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, more or less.  I just don't want to be bothered.  I don't want anybody to talk to me.  I want to be left alone.  Urges of self injury.
<b>DR:</b> Self injury urges.  How are you controlling that?
<b>PT:</b> Um, sleeping.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Usually, I would just do drugs.
<b>DR:</b> Sleeping and drugs.  Well, at least you're controlling them.
<b>PT:</b> And stealing and sex and all of the other -
<b>DR:</b> Stealing -
<b>PT:</b> Stuff I -
<b>DR:</b> And sex.
<b>PT:</b> Love doing.
<b>DR:</b> What are you stealing?
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm not, not doing the theft anymore.
<b>DR:</b> What were you stealing?
<b>PT:</b> Just whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Hum?
<b>PT:</b> Just whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Whatever, like, from where?
<b>PT:</b> Wherever.  What does it matter?
<b>DR:</b> Like clothing or something?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You know, you get arrested for shoplifting or something -
<b>PT:</b> That's why I don't do it.
<b>DR:</b> And then you really, you'll just -
<b>PT:</b> Theft -
<b>DR:</b> Start looking -
<b>PT:</b> Is -
<b>DR:</b> Like, uh -
<b>PT:</b> Bigger than cannabis charge.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You'll start looking, what, this is Class C misdemeanor.
<b>PT:</b> I had a Class C misdemeanor, but I pled guilty with a lesser one, so that -
<b>DR:</b> Which one was that, the paraphernalia?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> That's Class A?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  That's more serious than actually having the substance.
<b>DR:</b> I wonder why?
<b>PT:</b> Because you can smoke anything out of anything.  You can smoke crack out of a pipe.  You can smoke -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but what if you just have a pipe?
<b>PT:</b> Um, they have to smell if it's been used recently and what's been in there.  Like, if it smells like tobacco, obviously, it's a tobacco pipe, but if they smell weed -
<b>DR:</b> So use the old nose to tell, huh?
<b>PT:</b> And they probably did an analysis, an analysis on the piece to see what else has been in there.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.  I remember they used to sell that stuff at [DEIDENTIFIED].  Is that illegal now?
<b>PT:</b> You can go down to [DEIDENTIFIED] and get one at a shop.
<b>DR:</b> Are those shops legal or were they banned in the state?
<b>PT:</b> No, they're legal.  They're just for tobacco use only.
<b>DR:</b> Only.  Okay.  Got you.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> So a head shop, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> They sell bongs for tobacco?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Water pipes, pieces, small ones, big ones, gas masks.
<b>DR:</b> Gas masks.  Life's a gas, huh?  And why do you want to injust, ingest such substances?
<b>PT:</b> To feel the effects.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do you like -
<b>PT:</b> What's the point?
<b>DR:</b> The effects?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I want to be blown out of my mind all the time, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How does it feel like when you're blown out of your mind?
<b>PT:</b> Like I'm in a different dimension.  Like everything is more colorful, the music is better.  Music is amazing.
<b>DR:</b> I had -
<b>PT:</b> Makes you feel good.
<b>DR:</b> A few people today that talked about the other dimension, so, uh, it's getting popular.
<b>PT:</b> I just don't know what to do because I want to do drugs, period.  I don't know what to do.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  We're going to keep you on the Effexor and the Lyrica.  Now, did you ever take that Chantix?
<b>PT:</b> I'm not taking Chantix.  It makes me feel sick.  What's wrong with smoking cigarettes?  It's the only thing I have left.  It's the only thing I have left as an addictive personality.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's the old famous line like, you know, the person gives up the alcohol and saying, "How about quitting smoking?"  "Oh, my gosh.  Then what will I do for fun?"  The idea that, you know, you need your vices for your fun.
<b>PT:</b> It's the only crutch I have to lean on.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.  Well, you got your sex then, too.
<b>PT:</b> Well, no.
<b>DR:</b> What, that's not working?
<b>PT:</b> No, because I don't fuck random people.
<b>DR:</b> Um, what about your boyfriends?
<b>PT:</b> He's not a random person.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and I know, so does that work?
<b>PT:</b> It's not fulfilling.
<b>DR:</b> No?  Why not?
<b>PT:</b> Because I want to do drugs.
<b>DR:</b> You'd rather do drugs than sex.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] rats would rather have cocaine than sex.  You give them, give a rat the opportunity to mate versus cocaine, they'll take the cocaine any day.
<b>PT:</b> So would we.
<b>DR:</b> Um, what other fun activities can you get high on life with other than -
<b>PT:</b> Um, that's the thing.  I don't want to do anything.  I don't want to read.  I don't want to do artwork.  I don't want to do anything.  I don't want to go outside.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to go to the woods.  I don't want to, you know, well, I don't want to do anything.  I come home; I don't know what to do with myself.  Walk around my house; like, okay, now what the fuck do I do?
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes you smoke too much marijuana you get this thing where you don't want to do anything.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, yeah, there's the other opportunity to like, give you some Vyvanse or something.  You know, it's like a psycho stimulant medication.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I guess popping pills is better than smoking weed.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know, it's useful for people with attention deficit disorder or depression or lack of motivation.  You take one a day and, uh, just sort of carries you along.  You've never tried that and that might be worth trying.
<b>PT:</b> I'll take whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Although, you're bipolar, it's something that might well help.
<b>PT:</b> If not for manic.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, we don't want you to get manic.
<b>PT:</b> I won't.  I can't.  I've been wounded.
<b>DR:</b> Wounded?
<b>PT:</b> My being of energy has been subdued.  I don't care.  I don't feel happiness.  No more exhilaration, no more joy, no more interests; just obligations.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> And dragging through the day.
<b>DR:</b> Sounds sad.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.  Um, I have no choice.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, how about whistle while you work.  You ever try that one?
<b>PT:</b> What's to whistle about?
<b>DR:</b> What is that, "Snow White"?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, there's nothing to whistle about.  When I get off work, what's going to happen?  I'm not going to go get high, I'm not going to have fun, I'm not going to, I'm going to go home, go to bed, wake up, go to work.  In my free time, I just lay in bed.  And what, what, what do they want?
<b>DR:</b> What are your longer-range goals in life?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> Get married; have kids?
<b>PT:</b> I don't want kids.  I hate kids.
<b>DR:</b> Um, well, get married and work for an abortion clinic.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not pro choice.  I'm, I'm pro choice, but I'm not like, pro death.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.  So somewhere in between, huh?
<b>PT:</b> It's my body, my choice.
<b>DR:</b> Ah, substance abuse evaluators.  Now, where was your thing in?  What county did it happen?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'm not driving all the way up to [DEIDENTIFIED] to see those people.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, see, the kind of evaluation that these places may do may be different from what I would do.  I'd just give you a letter, written drug evaluation.
<b>PT:</b> Do I have to go up there?
<b>DR:</b> Not necessarily.  I can try to do a letter, I think.  Want me to do that?
<b>PT:</b> And a test?
<b>DR:</b> You got to get the urine drug screen.
<b>PT:</b> To go with the letter?
<b>DR:</b> That would be good.
<b>PT:</b> What about the second one you speak of?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, the second one, um, it would need to get done like in 2 more weeks.
<b>PT:</b> What?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Should go to the same lab.  Go to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> I can't imagine lasting 2 weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Well, the second one you need to do after [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Okay, I'll do it the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So get that other one the next day or so.  And what day did they sign this thing?  [DATE].  Okay.  So let's have you come back, um, like, [DATE].  And we'll put this all together.  I'm going to stop this now, and, uh, they'll have these.  Um, yeah, we'll have you come back on [DATE] and then we'll, we'll have what all we're going to put in there.  Are you working out, exercising or anything like that?  Huh?
<b>PT:</b> I'm working out my TV remote control.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Did I give you the Vyvanse script?  No.  Not yet.  Okay.  Let me write one for you.  Oh, it's right here.
<b>PT:</b> And now the television in my room [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You have a what in your -
<b>PT:</b> TV in my room.
<b>DR:</b> TV in your room.
<b>PT:</b> Thank God.
<b>DR:</b> You need to get more active in life, more physically.
<b>PT:</b> Just stay in my room.
<b>DR:</b> Just sit there and rot away, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.  Doesn't sound like much fun.
<b>PT:</b> No.  Oh, well.
<b>DR:</b> It's interesting though, that you chose to have that, uh, put on there, um, for the, uh, conditional release there, Class C.
<b>PT:</b> That was a bad idea.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.  Well, maybe that was a flash of insight that you had, you know?  I'll hang on to that.  And, uh, is your insurance paying?
<b>PT:</b> They're just paying [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> That's because that letter never went through.
<b>DR:</b> Which letter?
<b>PT:</b> The one that you said I was under the dependency of my parents, not just my mother.  [LAUGHING].  They were, started billing my dad, remember?  I mean, they started billing my mother, remember?
<b>DR:</b> Do you have the, a sufficient letter or do you need something different?
<b>PT:</b> I do need something different because they started billing the other parent.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  It's just [NAME OTHER] or a dependent of, I should say mother and father -
<b>PT:</b> Parents, I guess.
<b>DR:</b> So just change this to say, and parents, to say, her parents?
<b>PT:</b> I'm financially dependent on my parents.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Not forever.  Not for long.
<b>DR:</b> But so I should use this same thing, just say parents instead of mother?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So simple.
<b>PT:</b> It's ridiculous.  [INAUDIBLE].  I have no idea why.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  Well, I'm going to stop this thing -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> While I take this call and, uh, uh, it's not the cheapest thing in the world, but, um, yeah, we're going to go over a couple other things here.
