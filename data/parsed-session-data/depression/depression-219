BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> I saw you [DATE], I remember that session.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The heartbreak or the drama over the heartbreak.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, both, yeah
<b>DR:</b> But then you left me the message after letting me know the resolution.  Anyway, at that point, your mood was stable, you weren't sad or anxious or irritable, your appetite and sleep were good, your energy was good, you were exercising, you were getting pleasure normally, work was going well, you were dating, your self esteem was good, you were not suicidal, you were not helpless or hopeless, you were forward looking, concentration was fine, socially things were fine and so all of the mood disorder stuff was in pretty good shape and then there was this drama over the breakup that really had you in a bit of a state.
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, at that point, since your mood disorder was actually doing pretty well - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> We maintained your regimen of Depakote, Lithium, Wellbutrin, Lamictal, correct?
<b>PT:</b> The Lamictal is only there if I need it.  You said if the Wellbutrin didn't do its job - 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, Lamictal is just as needed?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, sort of like a back up to the Wellbutrin, so, and I haven't really used it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so we don't use Lamictal but you use Wellbutrin at 450, right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And you use 750 of Depakote?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And 300 of Lithium?
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.
<b>DR:</b> And nothing, as needed Klonopin?
<b>PT:</b> As needed Klonopin, right.
<b>DR:</b> But you don't need it that frequently?
<b>PT:</b> Well, one prescription lasted me until yesterday when I took the very last one but - 
<b>DR:</b> Oh good, all right.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well since August, that's pretty - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's really great on just the most stressful days like when I do the court on the [DATE], blah, blah, blah.
<b>DR:</b> I know some people who just take a crumb every day just to - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Smooth the rough edges.
<b>PT:</b> It's my favorite drug.
<b>DR:</b> It's not so bad, you know.
<b>PT:</b> You just calm down a little bit, it's easy to take like a really pleasant nap if you want to, if you don't want to you don't have to.
<b>DR:</b> It's very smooth.
<b>PT:</b> Very smooth, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right, how have you been in these five months?
<b>PT:</b> Mostly very good.
<b>DR:</b> Mostly okay.
<b>PT:</b> I think it's been the best year, you know, looking at stuff, despite the great drama of July and August; it's been the best year since the bipolar was - 
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Came up and was - 
<b>DR:</b> That's impressive.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think so too.  I'm very happy.  I give you a couple of exceptions,
<b>DR:</b> We've tightened the bolts.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> On the system.
<b>PT:</b> Yep
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't mean you don't cycle a little bit, you do cycle.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But uh, all right, so your mood's okay and reasonably stable.
<b>PT:</b> That's right, especially compared to previous years.
<b>DR:</b> Right and most of the time you're not sad?
<b>PT:</b> Correct.
<b>DR:</b> Most of the time you're not anxious?
<b>PT:</b> Correct.
<b>DR:</b> Most of the time you're not irritable?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You're allowed to be those things sometimes, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> But you're not allowed for the switch to be stuck in those states.
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> Your appetite is okay?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're sleeping well?
<b>PT:</b> I am mostly.
<b>DR:</b> Most nights you get to sleep, you stay asleep through the night, you wake up when you want to and you feel rested in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> I feel rested in the morning.  I tend to wake up at least once a night.
<b>DR:</b> Do you get right back to sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Within fifteen minutes, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Your energy is decent during the day?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Are you exercising?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well I had, this is the thing to talk about, I had to take a month off and I just started back two days ago because I had a pinched nerve in my neck which happened a year and a half ago and I was told under no circumstances - 
<b>DR:</b> They did an MRI and they saw bones?
<b>PT:</b> It's uh, the third and fourth vertebrae are a little too close together, it's a little inflamed and I have two little spurs, yeah, but the rest of my spine is perfect, like textbook but right there's a problem, so we lay off the gym for a month and I got some Cortisone shots and antiinflammatories and he didn't give me - 
<b>DR:</b> Are you still using the AndroGel?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yeah, and actually your office was nice enough to refill it before I saw you because I [INAUDIBLE].  Your last name is very similar to the doctor that I see for my shoulder.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah right, I think you called me once when you were trying to reach him, right?
<b>PT:</b> It's so embarrassing, so embarrassing. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, I think you called me on the emergency line, was it the emergency line?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, just your -
<b>DR:</b> Just the regular line.
<b>PT:</b> Through your voice mail line, yeah, I'm sorry.
<b>DR:</b> That's all right.
<b>PT:</b> Especially if [INAUDIBLE], so because of the not exercising, I think mostly but also interestingly enough, I ran out of Wellbutrin and so the past month I haven't exercised as much.
<b>DR:</b> You're not allowed to run out of Wellbutrin because we can all that in.
<b>PT:</b> Okay
<b>DR:</b> The stuff we can't call in easily is the Klonopin.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The Wellbutrin, that's a no brainer, just call us.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Don't call me, call them.
<b>PT:</b> Great.
<b>DR:</b> They'll pick your chart up, they'll call them in.
<b>PT:</b> Beautiful.
<b>DR:</b> You can even, even easier, have your pharmacy call them.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what my pharmacy likes to do, they like to call them.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, just call and I'll approve it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I mean if you haven't been here in many many months, they'll say hold on - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, you've got to have an appointment to do that but what was interesting was, for about a week, not this week but a week ago, I had, every day, I wasn't depressed, I wasn't, you know, suicidal, but I was a little lethargic and a little down, especially when I first woke up in the morning and I thought this is interesting, I wonder if it's both the lack of exercise and the Wellbutrin, or one or both, but it was the first time in a long time that I felt blue.
<b>DR:</b> And how long had you been off Wellbutrin before that happened?
<b>PT:</b> You know, two and a half, three weeks, that was probably it, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What we're seeing now is the short days, you know -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> The sunlight issue knocks the hell out of a lot of people.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So Christmas time and it wasn't family, it was sunlight, it was, the days were just so short.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> People were getting very depressed so that could be it too.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Are you seasonal, do you have bad winters?
<b>PT:</b> I do have bad winters but I tend to, what tends to happens is I tend to have bad holidays because my other two relationships that ended, both ended around Thanksgiving -
<b>DR:</b> An anniversary reactions.
<b>PT:</b> That's right and my aunt [NAME OTHER] who was almost as close as us as my mom, died around Thanksgiving, so the holidays, the past three or four years have not been great.
<b>DR:</b> How did Christmastime go for you, what did you do?
<b>PT:</b> It went well, I took the new boyfriend to [DEIDENTIFIED] to my family and it was - 
<b>DR:</b> Now when did you get involved with the new boyfriend?
<b>PT:</b> In late August.
<b>DR:</b> Nice bounceback.
<b>PT:</b> Not bad.  I mean it had been six months since [NAME OTHER] broke up with me but it had only been a month and a half since the craziness but he's the oldest person I've ever dated and we have the most in common.
<b>DR:</b> How old is he?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE]
<b>DR:</b> And it's a good relationship?
<b>PT:</b> He's a psychoanalyst, so this stuff is a no brainer for him but he also used to be an actor like I used to be an actor.  He actually went to [DEIDENTIFIED] and, you know, played violin, was a ballet dancer.  He says the whole performing arts thing is in his blood like it is in mine and he comes from a very old waspy family like I do and it's just very, very, very easy being with him.
<b>DR:</b> Oh very nice.
<b>PT:</b> Which certainly - 
<b>DR:</b> So how have things progressed?  You brought him to your family - 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> That's a big -
<b>PT:</b> I saw his family Thanksgiving.  I think at this, at this age, things happen a little bit faster because you either know it's working or not.  You're much more, as I am, attuned to what I know has worked and not worked in the past with other relationships and so does he.
<b>DR:</b> Right and I think you're more looking for a relationship than for playing the field at the same time.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, that's true too.
<b>DR:</b> So have you guys settled in together?
<b>PT:</b> He stays at my place almost every night.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And he has his own place still though?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're on the [DEIDENTIFIED] here?
<b>PT:</b> No, I was, that's the old address, I'm in [DEIDENTIFIED] now, do you know [DEIDENTIFIED] at all?
<b>DR:</b> A little bit.
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED], it's right there, it's beautiful.
<b>DR:</b> What's your new address?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Close to your old one, right.
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Do you want the zip?
<b>DR:</b> Uh yes.
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so it's very nice and where does he live?
<b>PT:</b> He lives on [DEIDENTIFIED] between [DEIDENTIFIED] and his office - 
<b>DR:</b> Does he leave most of his stuff at your place?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, no, but just enough.
<b>DR:</b> I mean he gets dressed in the morning from your -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he has enough clothes there and toiletries.
<b>DR:</b> And have you, I mean apparently things are going well, so have you talked about moving it even further?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Which would involve him moving into your place?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, he prefers where I live because [DEIDENTIFIED], it's really convenient, he just walks down [DEIDENTIFIED] and his office on [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But it's very noisy on [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> All the time.
<b>DR:</b> Does he own his place or does he -
<b>PT:</b> No, he rents.  That's the other nice thing, I don't know if we ever talked about this but with [NAME OTHER] and with [NAME OTHER] my long term relationship in [DEIDENTIFIED] I would often, I [INAUDIBLE] and it was a lot of money.  He's got family money set aside.  He doesn't ever have to work if he doesn't want to.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> So he - 
<b>DR:</b> It takes that out of the dynamic.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's so nice, it's so nice that, I mean not that he's, we like to say my sugar daddy but it's an equal partnership as opposed to me always being the one that's looking after the finances and that's a whole other pressure that's taken off but - 
<b>DR:</b> It's not just the pressure, there's an emotional part of it too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That you don't want.
<b>PT:</b> That's right, that's not, that's not a dynamic of whatever.
<b>DR:</b> You don't want there to be an ulterior aspect to the relationship.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, that's right.  So he has owned a lot but he sold a place a year and a half ago that he had with his ex who had died.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And after trying to live there on his own for a year and a half, he realized that it was just too big.
<b>DR:</b> How long was he with that ex?
<b>PT:</b> Twelve years.
<b>DR:</b> Oh wow.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he died suddenly, it wasn't like HIV or something, he had, he took way too much of a pain medication than you're supposed to, because it wasn't helping and he thought he just wasn't taking enough and he overdosed on pain medication and stopped breathing. 
<b>DR:</b> Well that's what happens.
<b>PT:</b> That's what happens, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You take too much opiates, you just stop breathing. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, [NAME OTHER] used to sleep in another room once in while because apparently this guy was a real snorer and he was, he got up in the morning and just went to wake him up and he was, yeah, so we each had our little traumas.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I consider his worse than mine, of course, no one died.
<b>DR:</b> Well, no but it's happened to him.  Whenever it happens to you it's worse.  [INAUDIBLE] selfish about it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, it also depends on what else you've been through in your life and the context.
<b>DR:</b>  Yeah but yours was painful.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yours tore your heart out, you know.
<b>PT:</b> It was pretty darn bad.
<b>DR:</b> But what was the outcome, with the police and with the - 
<b>PT:</b> Oh right, the [DEIDENTIFIED] DA, once my lawyer spoke to her a couple of times and gave her some information she didn't have, dismissed all the charges and actually said to my lawyer, we now know who the aggressor was and who the victim was in the situation and [PATIENT NAME] was clearly not the aggressor. 
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> She didn't come out and say that [NAME OTHER] was, but - 
<b>DR:</b> Well, she can't say too much because you could sue, I mean you have a case against everyone.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, the police.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> For putting me in jail overnight for no reason.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Just because someone lied to them and they believed him.
<b>DR:</b> You have a case there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're not going to pursue it?
<b>PT:</b> Oh no, it's just not worth it.
<b>DR:</b> Not worth it.
<b>PT:</b> I have some friends that are still after me to do that but I'm not going to bother.
<b>DR:</b> No but if she would have said something incriminating  - 
<b>PT:</b> That's why she wouldn't, she chose her words carefully, that's right, so then to get it all over with at the trial on the [DATE], the agreement was they would drop all the charges if I would sign another year of an order of protection that [NAME OTHER] wanted, like that I was some threat to him, so I can't call him or email but I wouldn't want to anyway.
<b>DR:</b> Good, perfect.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, right.
<b>DR:</b> It's enforced separation.
<b>PT:</b> That's right, that's right, and he can't either, so - 
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> It's very odd.
<b>DR:</b> It's a horrible way to end a relationship.
<b>PT:</b> Isn't it.
<b>DR:</b> It's horrible.
<b>PT:</b> Since then I've found out, I have three or four really close friends that I didn't know until I got threatened, they really were his friends first and, they didn't, I don't want to say they sided with me but we just over the years have become closer than they were and they all told me since then, the only other relationship he had, he also ended it very dramatically.
<b>DR:</b> You mean before you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, there was one guy before me and he ended that one and really the other guy was like a wreck apparently for a long time afterwards and then they reminded that his father died very suddenly of a heart attack when he was in college and we think that -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's recurrence, like the only way, now he could have had legitimate reasons to want to break up with me.
<b>DR:</b> Your psychoanalyst probably has good insight into this stuff, they love this stuff.
<b>PT:</b> And one of my best friends is a woman named [NAME OTHER] who I knew as a client first, she the director of [DEIDENTIFIED] for a big [DEIDENTIFIED] law firm but she used to be a psychiatrist and the three of us had dinner one night and I listened to two of those, [INAUDIBLE] the terminology and everything, borderline personality, classic, what's the word when you're - 
<b>DR:</b> Narcissist.
<b>PT:</b> Narcissism.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's [INAUDIBLE] but, what was I going to say, you know, it's not like I'm a perfect person, he could have had legitimate reasons why he thought he should move on but to have to go to that extent - 
<b>DR:</b> The way he did it.
<b>PT:</b> To emotionally break himself away from me as opposed to just kind of let it end, that's what's so striking, you know, and tough from my side but I don't, I don't really hold a grudge anymore, I just don't want to bother and - 
<b>DR:</b> I told you though, it happened, one of the stimulus to this happening was you getting well.  I remember - 
<b>PT:</b> That's right, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> When you were unwell, you were sucking all the oxygen and there was no need for that.
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> But when you got well, it was a real relationship and it was a relationship that was getting more intimate and evolving and I think that's what scared him off.
<b>PT:</b> Well, it's funny you say that because that's the way people described the first relationship before me, that the other guy was very weak, he had done, he was half American and half Philippino and he had grown up, had his childhood on the streets of [DEIDENTIFIED] and was very very needy and after a while though, he had gone to nursing school and become an RN and had a really good job at -
<b>DR:</b> He started getting his - 
<b>PT:</b> Life back.
<b>DR:</b> Life together, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think [NAME OTHER] likes it when the other person is weaker and needs to be taken care of.
<b>DR:</b> And needier.
<b>PT:</b> Needier.
<b>DR:</b> Emotionally needier.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm not, over the course of my life, generally a needy person.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Like he was, he was incredibly helpful when I was at my worst, especially my depression. 
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> He was wonderful but you can't, you don't want a long term relationship with someone who wants you to be sick the whole time.
<b>DR:</b> You know, I mean as you get more well, you'll have compassion for him.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Because you're moving forward, he's, he won't move forward.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because he's not facing any of the stuff, I mean I sort of have to - 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But you're right, he doesn't like the idea of going to a therapist and he doesn't have anything to turn to for that.
<b>DR:</b> Let's go through your cycles since it's been five months.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> So in these five months, where have, have you had mild cycles or I mean where have you been?
<b>PT:</b> Twice in the fall I felt like I was getting a little too high.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And so I took twice as much Lithium two nights in a row and on the second morning, after two nights of doing that, it was like clunk.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good.
<b>PT:</b> Like, you know -
<b>DR:</b> On the Lithium, we usually don't use Lithium that way but you can, just be careful because - 
<b>PT:</b> Overdose on Lithium is not a pretty thing is it?
<b>DR:</b> It's not a pretty, no.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that happened a few years ago.
<b>DR:</b> It's really ugly and I mean you can get permanent brain damage, it's horrible.
<b>PT:</b> Is it better to use the Depakote, to go higher on the Depakote if I -
<b>DR:</b> If Lithium works for you -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do it but make sure you don't get nauseous.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't get nauseous.
<b>DR:</b> Nausea and tremor would be the first signs of being Lithium toxic.  You're on a low enough dose, it doesn't matter.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I usually have people do it with Depakote or Zyprexa.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Other meds, like kind of their as needed most stabilizers.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But if Lithium works for you, you can use it.
<b>PT:</b> Because my regular dosage is pretty low, it's not - 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Not as dangerous.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know -
<b>PT:</b> It worked both times, one time was [DATE], [NAME OTHER] returned to [DEIDENTIFIED] where we met for the long weekend, we actually got to stay in the same place he was staying when I met him and on the second night I felt, you know, I was having a great time and we were away from it all and everything but I was [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Racing thoughts, talking too much?
<b>PT:</b> Talking too fast, talking too much, I don't remember having racing thoughts actually.
<b>DR:</b> Fair judgement, grandiose?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So our meds had you somewhat contained?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Right, you really -
<b>PT:</b> I think I've just become much more attuned to when it starts to happen than I ever was before and [NAME OTHER] is also, you know, I asked him, I said, you know, if you don't mind, I'd like having more than one watchdog, there's one person that works - 
<b>DR:</b> Does he know bipolar?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yeah, he knows it really well.
<b>DR:</b> He's a psychoanalyst, what's his training?
<b>PT:</b> He did his masters at [DEIDENTIFIED] and his PhD at [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, he's [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] all of us here.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] medical?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, he doesn't have a medical degree.
<b>DR:</b> Right, but psychologists train also up at, [DEIDENTIFIED] psychoanalytic they have.
<b>PT:</b> Right, that's what it is.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's our people.
<b>PT:</b> Our people, so anyway, he agreed with me, I said to him, I'm feeling - 
<b>DR:</b> Does he have a private practice?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, a private practice and he teaches, he's actually teaching a course at [DEIDENTIFIED] this spring.
<b>DR:</b> So he puts them on the couch four times a week.
<b>PT:</b> Well, he wishes everybody would - 
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yes, transference space, yes.  He does, not all his patients are psychoanalytic.
<b>DR:</b> It's very hard to get psychoanalytic patients.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, people don't want to commit that much time anymore do they.
<b>DR:</b> And money, it's very expensive.
<b>PT:</b> Right but some of them really need it.
<b>DR:</b> Well - 
<b>PT:</b> He's a little frustrated with a couple of people who he just, I mean there's just no question that he feels frustrated that he can't move them ahead because they need more than once a week, they just do.
<b>DR:</b> It gets very intense on the stress side too.
<b>PT:</b> I know it is.  When he has the day where it's really crazy, there's two days with this real crazy lady who is all about that she's horrible and she's not successful and she is, she's [INAUDIBLE] on her own work, she actually has a good job, actually lives in a really nice place and she's trying a relationship.  He'll come back and he'll say to me, oh, I'm no good at my job and I said wait a minute, transference, can I just say one word, transference.  He went, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I still feel like that, so he does, it's interesting watching him go through that.
<b>DR:</b> Well his feelings towards her is called a counter transference.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Transference is her feelings towards him.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But it's the counter transference that gets him in trouble.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> All the things he's, you know -
<b>PT:</b> So he saw her supervisor today and they talked a lot about that apparently.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So anyway, he's a good person, he's an incredible, and he's the kindest person I've ever met.  He's so empathetic and kind to me, it's amazing, so that time in [DEIDENTIFIED], I turned to him and said, you know, this is one of those times I warned you about, I think.  He said yeah I've been noticing all afternoon you've been talking really fast, kind of not taking a breath, so I brought the Lithium and I took a sleeping pill.
<b>DR:</b> You know, you can do Lithium and Depakote.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Both if it's only going to be one or two days.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And put yourself to sleep.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Four Klonopin - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Just to knock it down, just go to sleep.  If you can see it happening, knock it down and you're a mild enough bipolar now, since you're pretty well treated - 
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> That that'll do it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You know, in the old days -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it worked.
<b>DR:</b> In, you know, a real bipolar, it's too late, once you're revved, you're taking off but you're a soft bipolar now so we can rope that in.
<b>PT:</b> It's such a wonderful thing.
<b>DR:</b> Do you go the other way, do you crash at all?
<b>PT:</b> Not really, just like I said, you know, a couple weeks ago - 
<b>DR:</b> So this happened two times?
<b>PT:</b> Twice, yeah, the second time was mid December, we had this whole, it seems to be just when I'm like away from it all having a great time and I just get a little too excited I guess.  We had sort of a Christmas date, went out and looked at all the window, went to lunch at [DEIDENTIFIED] and shopped and had tea at the [DEIDENTIFIED] and then went back to [DEIDENTIFIED] and got ready to go out to see friends and I could just feel the thing going - 
<b>DR:</b> The juice.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I didn't do anything about it right at that moment.  We went out and had dinner with friends and then went back and I went in to the same thing I did in October.
<b>DR:</b> The Lithium, a little extra?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Two nights in a row and by Monday morning I could barely get out of bed, not sad, it was just like, you know, my body is tired.
<b>DR:</b> I love it, I love those stories, that's great.
<b>PT:</b> It's really, and he thinks - 
<b>DR:</b> You can call me when that happens.
<b>PT:</b> Just to give you a little alert to what's going on.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah but you did exactly the right thing.
<b>PT:</b> Good, good.
<b>DR:</b> You know my, what do they say, don't give someone food, teach them to farm, right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> My goal here is to teach you to know how to manage it mostly.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's your illness.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> We'll learn about the drugs together -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You've got to learn which ones, when you're getting ill - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah
<b>DR:</b> Which ones to take, that's the key.
<b>PT:</b> You've been much clearer than the people I saw before you and explained to me what the drugs are, what they do, how they work, which ones, blah, blah, blah.  I'm not expert, obviously, but at this point I just feel so much more aware of what I put in my body and what to do when.
<b>DR:</b> You know - 
<b>PT:</b> It feels like people who have diabetes or HIV or something, they know how to treat, you know what I'm saying, as opposed to this terrible thing I can't control and that gives me peace of mind which I think probably, right, it can't hurt that - 
<b>DR:</b> Well, exactly and I say that to people.  You know, people get all depressed that they're bipolar, I say, you know, it's better than diabetes, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Or another disease or cancer.
<b>DR:</b> Right, it's better than cancer.  In today's day and age, it's the most treatable condition, it' fine.  You can live a totally normal life.
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> And treat it.
<b>PT:</b> And I have, the thing for me too, I think we talked about this, I have a mother and a brother who have been treated with just Lithium for years and they've both done great.  In fact, they're two of the most stable, happy people I know, it's kind of ironic.  If anybody said to someone that knew my brother for the past five or ten years and then someone said oh by the way, did you know he's bipolar, they'd be shocked.
<b>DR:</b> Is he a big bipolar?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> He hasn't had big episodes?
<b>PT:</b> No, just one when he was in college and since then it's been very, he's a physics professor, he's like a calm calming person, you want to be around him to be at ease.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What's his dose, what's his Lithium dose?
<b>PT:</b> Twice of mine.
<b>DR:</b> You're on 300.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Even at 600, it's not - 
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But I kind of like having two low doses.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Rather than one big one.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, more to play with?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, more to play with and also by staying under the threshold for side effects, you minimize - 
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Negative consequences. 
<b>PT:</b> I remember, this is before you, when I was in [DEIDENTIFIED], this was probably three years ago and I took too much Lithium accidentally, I woke up in the middle of the night and felt, I wasn't sleeping and I was hyper and I, what was it, I thought I was taking, you know, Tylenol PM or something and it was Lithium and I took too much and the next night I was like angry and irritable and my body felt horrible and I was just a wreck, then I read about it on line.
<b>DR:</b> Lithium toxicity is terrible.
<b>PT:</b> Awful.
<b>DR:</b> It's awful.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's weird, it's such a simple -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's just [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> It's amazing, it's changed the world though, I mean Lithium is great.
<b>PT:</b> It's like aspirin, right, I mean really.
<b>DR:</b> Well, aspirin is different.  Aspirin comes from the bark of a tree.
<b>PT:</b> No but I mean it's as important and basic to bipolar as aspirin is to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Although things have changed since the world of the anticonvulsants, you know, anticonvulsant treatment like Depakote, Tegretol, Trileptal and now there's a new world of treatments with bipolar.
<b>PT:</b> What's the one advertised on TV all the time?
<b>DR:</b> Abilify or Zyprexa?
<b>PT:</b> Zyprexa.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And that's based on what?
<b>DR:</b> Your antipsychotic medicines that have been shown to work really well for bipolar, the problem is we don't like to go to antipsychotic medicines unless we have to.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> There's a potentially long term terrible side effect.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> Where you get a movement disorder.  Did you ever see any old schizophrenics, they move their mouth.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they move something on their face, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's called tardive dyskinesia.  It's a long term, it takes twenty years to get it but once you get it, it doesn't go away, then you're stuck for life, you know, tongue darting and lip moving.
<b>PT:</b> No thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Right, so we really don't want to go to those types of medicines unless we have to.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But that hasn't stopped the drug reps from trying to push us to use them for regular bipolars.
<b>PT:</b> I've always need to ask this of all my doctors, I've worked, not with sales reps, with a few, but at [DEIDENTIFIED] they call them health science associates, they're more, well they might, because you did research work at [DEIDENTIFIED], they might have interacted with you, the people who are more like liaisons between the [DEIDENTIFIED] research people and the research doctors.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> We're always trying to get money from them to do studies.
<b>PT:</b> Right and I train them on how to conduct meetings with people like you, how to go in and treat you with respect and ask you more questions and not talk at you so much and find the links the coming around, all this crap and body language and all the stuff that we do, but I've heard a lot of sales reps, do they actually come to this office and you make them stand in one particular spot and wait for you or do you even like see salesmen?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I see them.
<b>PT:</b> Some doctors have very strict rules as to what day of the week, where the person stands, you know they really -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's an interesting aspect of modern medicine.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know, with us, I mean we've got nice patients and all but it's kind of nice, beautiful women coming in, you know - 
<b>PT:</b> The sales reps?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Depends on who they hire.
<b>DR:</b> Attractive and charming and they're chatting and, you know, so - 
<b>PT:</b> Oh, after a day of dealing with -
<b>DR:</b> Right, of seeing -
<b>PT:</b> Mentally ill people.
<b>DR:</b> Sick patients, one after another, in the middle of your day you have kind of a breath of fresh air.
<b>PT:</b> I never thought of it that way.
<b>DR:</b> Good food, right.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> We got [DEIDENTIFIED], they brought all this nice [DEIDENTIFIED]'s stuff, they come in chatting, you know, and even if they're not chatting about their drug -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know what their agenda is, you know who's paying for the food, you know, so it's great marketing.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know, it's really great marketing.  It's cheap, right, I mean what does lunch cost them and, you know, so -
<b>PT:</b> The personal touch.
<b>DR:</b> The personal touch and they know that, that's who they hire, I mean look who they hire, it's charm.
<b>PT:</b> Good look, upbeat, gift of gab.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.
<b>PT:</b> Interesting.
<b>DR:</b> Now we do talk about the meds a little bit but as a researcher, I mean, you know, there's nothing they're going to -
<b>PT:</b> Tell you that you don't already know.
<b>DR:</b> Tell me -
<b>PT:</b> You knew before the drug came out.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I'm not that on top of it but I'm pretty on top of it -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Because this is what I do.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You know, I better and we're always looking for, all we are is our bag of tricks.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] that we need, more drugs, more different ways to use them so we like drugs, you know, we like new drugs we learn about so there's not that much they're going to, you know, tell us.
<b>PT:</b> Right, I see.
<b>DR:</b> And everything they tell us you have to take with a grain of salt anyway because it's, but it's a very interesting, you know, interaction.
<b>PT:</b> Cool, that's good for me to know when I'm doing my - 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> When I'm seeing clients, interesting.
<b>DR:</b> So you deal with [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] doesn't have much of a presence in the psychiatrist's office.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> They're not that big in general these days, they -
<b>PT:</b> Oh they've had their troubles, they've had serious troubles but, yeah, it just go happened I had a personal connectin there so I got more work there than anywhere else and it's not my focus, I mean law firms and [INAUDIBLE] to be my real market.
<b>DR:</b> And you go in and do a dog and pony show?
<b>PT:</b> For the law firms?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> No, I do training programs, they're interactive, so imagine twelve people in a room with a huge table or conference table meeting with an instructor, a video camera, we do role plays and lots and lots of interactive exercises so it's very little lecture.
<b>DR:</b> Right and it's around marketing?
<b>PT:</b> That's one thing we do.
<b>DR:</b> It's around how to present yourself?
<b>PT:</b> And any kind of business person or lawyer has to communicate in business so marketing for potential clients, managing a junior person, presenting to your peers, presenting to a large group, interviewing.
<b>DR:</b> So you give in kind of tough situations, here's how you might manage it professionally.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, at the beginning showing us what you currently do without any instruction.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Then we do all, we work on [INAUDIBLE] and listening skills and all the things that might come to play in that kind of a meeting and then they [INAUDIBLE] place where they can see.  It's fun.
<b>DR:</b> That's pretty cool and it uses your talent at being an actor.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> At being up there, being, you know -
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> And listening and getting people talking.
<b>PT:</b> That's right and that's why I've only hired ex actors - 
<b>DR:</b> Do you?
<b>PT:</b> Who also have business or law firm experience because I recognized that the company I used to work at before I started [DEIDENTIFIED], I thought the strongest people were the ex actors and the old company actually had to suppress that news, they thought we should, you know, they wanted me to push my [INAUDIBLE] in [DEIDENTIFIED] and my family business experience and not my acting but the minute I started my own company, I just said, I'm just going to and people love it, oh my God, you were on [DEIDENTIFIED], you were in [DEIDENTIFIED], oh my God, you know, and they just think it's so great.
<b>DR:</b> What prescriptions do you need?
<b>PT:</b> I need just about everything.  I need - 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Wellbutrin, obviously.
<b>DR:</b> Wellbutrin, remind me the dose.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Wellbutrin, you're on 450, three pills every morning?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You don't show up much, I'll give you four refills.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you because that's the one that has to be filled the most often.
<b>DR:</b> Right, do not run out of medicine.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You know  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [IINAUDIBLE], that's the other thing, a block and a half away is this amazing family owned pharmacy and they are right there, they fill it right away, not the CVS thing.
<b>DR:</b> Lithium?
<b>PT:</b> I need Lithium, I need Depakote, and I need - 
<b>DR:</b> The Lithium 300 mg, I'd rather you just take four a day.
<b>PT:</b> So you can precribe more.
<b>DR:</b> Just so you get a lot of them, you know, you take one and that'll last you four months.
<b>PT:</b> That's what you did last time which is why it lasted a long time, I had a little bit left over from before.
<b>DR:</b> Depakote, you take three of the 250's?
<b>PT:</b> Three, yeah, at night.
<b>DR:</b> I'll write that you take three twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> You've got good handwriting for a doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Thank you.  
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] drugstore with all those [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] some day and the Klonopin.
<b>DR:</b> Klonopin, do you get the 25's?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> 25 mg, I'll write that you take five a day.
<b>PT:</b> And AndroGel.
<b>DR:</b> Do you take the 5?
<b>PT:</b> We decided I was going to do two, two of the little packets.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, do you get something from them?
<b>PT:</b> I do, I don't know, it's like psychosomatic, I get a sense of well being after I put it on.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Don't ask me why.  Also I couldn't work out for a month because of my pinched nerve and I still look okay and I think that might be part of the reason.
<b>DR:</b> What's your age again?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE].  Oh, you should write down my, isn't it against your rules to go to a patients event of some type in the their personal life, is that not cool?
<b>DR:</b> What kind of event?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm inviting like everybody I know, when I turn [AGE] a year and a half from now, I'm going to do a concert for like all my friends and family.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> My best friend is [NAME OTHER] who's a big musical director on [DEIDENTIFIED] and we're going to hire an orchestra and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That might be, I might be able to break a boundary for that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean it's not that we'd interact directly, you'd just sit there and listen to an hour of performing.
<b>DR:</b> It would be a boundary violation but you're actually allowed to break them if you recognize it and you kind of acknowledge it.
<b>PT:</b> Huh.
<b>DR:</b> You can talk to your psychoanalyst friend about it, you know, they're not as rigid as they used to be.
<b>PT:</b> Huh.
<b>DR:</b> About breaking boundaries, as long as you're kind of aware that you're breaking it and do within a [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> You know what's happened to him is, what does he have like twenty patients or something, three of them live in my area in [DEIDENTIFIED] and all three of them have seen us walking down the street holding hands and bring it up in a session and the whole session becomes that, you know, like why are you happy, why do you have such a handsome boyfriend and I can't have one and he's like ugh.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's a very, transference is a very complicated thing.
<b>PT:</b> I'm glad -
<b>DR:</b> That's the whole treatment is the transference.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what he says.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> What a thing to go through every day of your life.  He's like, no, I'll just [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Here you go.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you so much.
<b>DR:</b> See you in three months.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, bye.
<b>DR:</b> Bye bye.
