BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Anyway, I, um, now you called [NAME OTHER] yesterday?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Did you call her?
<b>PT:</b> I tried to call the pager number and it was really confusing, the pager thing isn't scheduled for now, I don't even know.  I just couldn't understand.  So, then I called here and -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you called Lanton Hospital?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's who it was.
<b>DR:</b> And what did they say?
<b>PT:</b> And I asked for, heh, heh, and they said who are you trying to contact and I was like [PHYSICIAN NAME] and they were like what's his first name and I was like, um, I'm not sure.  He's a psychiatrist.  They're like, oh, he's not available to be paged right now or something.  It was confusing.
<b>DR:</b> Yesterday?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yesterday.  Or maybe it was the day before.  No, wait, yesterday, yep, um-hum.  And so then I called here and I was like I got through on a page.  It was okay.  I just didn't -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I'm finding this like, uh, when was the last time I asked not to be paged.  It was like three weeks ago, two weeks ago.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, really?  Okay.
<b>DR:</b> For, for six hours.  I don't know.
<b>PT:</b> That's funny.  It's okay.
<b>DR:</b> It's really strange.  And anyway, it said they were supposed to call if, that there was a certain time that they were to call me on my cell phone because my page, I was out of range.  I don't know, whatever.
<b>PT:</b> That's weird.
<b>DR:</b> Sorry about that, I'll call them today.
<b>PT:</b> That's okay.  But yeah, I figured that I should probably notify someone.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Thanks.  Did you tell [NAME OTHER] this?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I'll call down today.  I've got nine billion phone calls.  All right, so, all right, anyway, so you, um, are not taking, I understand, Abilify?
<b>PT:</b> Correct.
<b>DR:</b> As of when?
<b>PT:</b> I just stopped it yesterday because it is wigging me out a lot.
<b>DR:</b> What do you mean?
<b>PT:</b> Like, well, one night, I felt like I was hitting sort of a depression and so I've had like what?  Two manic episodes since I was on it, so it didn't seem to be helping in that respect, so I was like sorta holding out to make me at least not depressed.  But I got like really uber depressed and I, like, wouldn't get out of bed and then I woke up and I was like so hungry and I started crying because I didn't have enough energy to like get up and eat food and I called, like in my bed, I called my house on my cell phone and asked mom to like pick me up something from a restaurant because I couldn't get out of bed and she was like, um, no, but I'll make you something and then I was like no, I don't know why, and then I got really upset, crying again and then, all of a sudden my wrists hurt and I realized I was like biting my wrists.  Like, I don't understand what I was doing, but I was obviously not thinking straight and then that got me upset because I was like, I am like trying to hurt myself and why am I trying to do that because I logically didn't want to and yeah, then I ended up calling some friends and no one answered their phones and I took it like really personally, like everyone was abandoning me.  Yknow, I knew rationally that that wasn't the case.  They just didn't have their phones with them and then I got in touch with someone and I told them to stay on the phone with me for a little until they could talk me into actually moving and then I drove over to a friend's house to sleep there until I felt like okay and then I came back and I was like no more.  Ha, ha.  And, um, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Now, is that stranger than you've been before?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  It was pretty bad for a while.  And, um, and in general, for the past week or so, I've been feeling more lazy and sort of upset about little things.  Like I let every little thing get to me.  Um, so, yeah, just even though I know I'm not a doctor or anything, it just doesn't seem to be doing anything and I'm still sometimes nauseous and dizzy and stuff.  So I'm like, I can handle side effects if it's making me stable -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But if it's not, then what's, like, the point?  So, I'm just not feeling -
<b>DR:</b> I mean, we're only on very -
<b>PT:</b> 7.5.
<b>DR:</b> Hm?
<b>PT:</b> 7.5.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  
<b>PT:</b> And maybe it wasn't the medicine at all doing that.  But, still, nothing good was happening.
<b>DR:</b> You were only on seven and a half for a couple of days, right?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Um, so, okay.  So we need to think of something else that might be more helpful with mood swings that you're having, with the thoughts, some of the thoughts you get.  I mean, where are you with, um, uh, now wait a minute.  Let's see.  Um, all right.  Are we still, are you still, are you scheduled for, um, did you get tested?
<b>PT:</b> I did.  But they, uh, don't have the results back, or they're not -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you just finished recently?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, like a week ago.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b> That was fun, by the way.
<b>DR:</b> It was?
<b>PT:</b> It was.  I got to do the ink blot test thing.  It was pretty cool.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I didn't know like they really did that.  
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, sometimes.  Last week, you said?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Um, so, because I know we were gonna wait for those results, although this sounded pretty, pretty severe.
<b>PT:</b> It just, it scared me a little and like, I, and I always think like, cause my best friend's bipolar, too, and like -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> When she was put on antidepressants, she got suicidal and I know I'm not being medicated like that.
<b>DR:</b> No, no, you're not going on antidepressants.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's just naturally like weirded me out.  
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But this, I mean, um, um, I don't know.  We've done some unusual things, some of these mistakes.
<b>PT:</b> I've also maxed out my credit card twice.  I spent over three thousand three hundred dollars in the past two months.  So, my parents gave me their credit card since I can't use mine.
<b>DR:</b> They did?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm gonna be careful with it, though.  But they gave it to me to take to New York because my mom doesn't know I'm bipolar so she just, I don't know what she was thinking.  
<b>DR:</b> She knows you spend all this money?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she saw my credit card.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, God.
<b>PT:</b> Some of it's doctor bills, though, in my defense.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, but, um, yeah, I don't know where the money goes, but.  Ha, ha.  Not in my pocket.  
<b>DR:</b> No.  Have you looked at the bills?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> What did you buy?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I tend to buy a lot of things for my friends.  I tend to order a lot of books online.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I went on like a binge shopping at Victoria's Secret even though none of their bras fit me.  Um, I returned that, though, so I got my money back.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's good.
<b>PT:</b> I have to pay shipping and handling on that stuff, but, um.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> That was like a hundred and forty dollars.
<b>DR:</b> For shipping and handling?
<b>PT:</b> No, like for the purchase.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, the stuff.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.  All right.  Thank you.  A hundred and forty dollars.  Gosh.
<b>PT:</b> And I took my six hundred dollar trip to Utah and now I'm going to New York.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> When are you going to New York?
<b>PT:</b> Tomorrow.  
<b>DR:</b> You are? 
<b>PT:</b> For a few days, um-hum.  So, my friends and I decided we were gonna get tattoos, but then I realized I decided that when I was not thinking clearly so I made my friend promise me he wouldn't let me get a tattoo and he said he'd watch out.
<b>DR:</b> So you were going with your friend.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> That's good, that's good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I'll be okay.  He knows.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  So, oh God, um, all right.  Now, before this, were you on, were you ever on meds before?  No.
<b>PT:</b> I was on Celexa for like two weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that made you, like, whooo.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But other than that?
<b>PT:</b> No, nothing.
<b>DR:</b> It was just that two weeks.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, oh, God, um, are you sleeping at night?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Some.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I get like eight hours of sleep, but it might just start at like two a.m. or like I've been napping a lot.  Um, in the afternoons, like three hours, at maybe like four o'clock.  It's like I'll wake up and I'll be good for about two hours and then I'll be really, really tired again and I'll sleep.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  I would say, how long you gonna be in New York?
<b>PT:</b> I'm coming back on [DATE].  Just the weekend.
<b>DR:</b> Um, I don't know.  I mean, I think something, we should do something, but I don't necessarily want to start you on anything major when you're going away.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But, I mean, but if I give you something new to start, like on Monday morning or something.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Would you, I don't know.  Would you feel comfortable taking like a smaller dose of Abilify for a couple of days?  So I know you have something that, yknow, I guess I'm afraid that without that, yknow, it might be doing nothing, but, yknow, it might -
<b>PT:</b> I feel like it is doing nothing.
<b>DR:</b> No, I mean you have, one of these episodes you had before you were on it, but -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but it doesn't feel like anything's changed.  And maybe I've just been getting a little ill not related to that, but it just doesn't seem to have any positive.
<b>DR:</b> Well, all right.  Um, all right.  Why don't we, um, I think I'll, I don't know.  Let's give you something to start on -
<b>PT:</b> You want the rest of my Abilify back?
<b>DR:</b> Sure.  The samples, thank you.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Until the [DATE], yeah, okay.  All right, let's do this.  Let's start you on, on Lamictal.
<b>PT:</b> Wait, what was that?
<b>DR:</b> Lamictal.
<b>PT:</b> That's what my friend's taking.
<b>DR:</b> Is it?
<b>PT:</b> And she likes it.  And it took her like six months to adjust to it, but, ha ha.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you have to go up really slowly.  The biggest problem is, the thing that, yknow, generally it doesn't affect your, it doesn't make you sleepy, it doesn't generally affect your appetite or, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> No weight gain?
<b>DR:</b> No, average is weight neutral.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, some people could, from anything, get a headache or stomachache, but generally not.  But rash was the only thing you gotta watch for.
<b>PT:</b> A rash?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Where would that, like on my body, or -
<b>DR:</b> No, anywhere, I don't know.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> So, what you need to do is everyday, real quick, look at your face, chest, arms, legs, stomach, back, make sure there's no rash.  If it's a little bit of a rash, you can watch it.  If it's not getting any bigger, just keep watching it.  If it's spreading, yknow, getting bigger fast, then you probably need to stop taking the Lamictal and go to urgent care, tell somebody you're on Lamictal, just to see, they can look at it.  The biggest thing is if it's, and no one that I know, I've had thousands of people on this.  
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Five percent of the people get a rash.  Most of the time, you lower the dose and stop it and start it real slowly.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Once in a while, now I haven't had anybody like this, but once in a while, you can get a serious rash where it's like flaky.  If it's flaky, then you need to see somebody immediately.
<b>PT:</b> Is that like it's deadly or something?
<b>DR:</b> No, but it, no, but it could become a serious rash or it could become a, it could potentially become something that might be deadly, but the reason we start so slowly is to kind of prevent that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, I will, here sign this, just read it and you can sign that.  I had a reaction that was, that was like starting towards that on Bactrim a long time ago.  Um, it was weird, but.  All right, you can just sign under here where it says - 
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> But this thing, I'm gonna open it and show you, this you can start today if you want.  But this, yknow, because it's unlikely you're gonna have any problems and you should, yknow, this is week one, week two, take one a day, week three, two a day together.  Week four, week five.  Twenty five, so that would be fifty and a hundred.
<b>PT:</b> That sounds like a lot, but it isn't.
<b>DR:</b> Now, no, they make a hundred, they make a two hundred, they make a one fifty and a two hundred.  Generally, one fifty to three hundred is where people end up.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, all right, so, I'd like you to take that and next, next week, are you scheduled for next week?  Are you in the system regularly?
<b>PT:</b> Um, uh, yeah, next Wednesday at three o'clock.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  So, unless things change and things are not good, in which case, call, um, I'll see you Wednesday.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> So, we'll start this today.  They obviously make some other medication, but we'll see.  Let me know how you're sleeping, how you're doing.
<b>PT:</b> Well, why, what's the difference between - 
<b>DR:</b> This is, this is to prevent most, actually, I need to ask you something real quick - how tall are you?  
<b>PT:</b> Five feet four inches. 
<b>DR:</b> So what's that, sixty five and how much do you weigh?
<b>PT:</b> 115.
<b>DR:</b> 115?  Okay.  Um, I have to get, I have to put that, for some reason.  Um, anyway, um, no, so I wanted to, um, this helps rapid move swings and depression.  It doesn't necessarily help manic episodes.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> But it helps you from flipping into them, back and forth.  So, depending upon how you're doing, I might want to do something that will help with that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  All right.  So, and call if there's a problem.  Otherwise, I'll see you next week.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Thanks.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, thank you.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
