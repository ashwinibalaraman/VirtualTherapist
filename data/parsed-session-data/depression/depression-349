BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: I'm okay. I just realized I'm out tissues though, sorry.
CLIENT: (laughs) I'll be okay. (laughs)
THERAPIST: I can get some paper towels from the bathroom. Would that be better?
CLIENT: Um, (inaudible at 00:00:28) fine. It'll be fine. (inaudible) Man, a psychologist running out of tissues.
THERAPIST: I know.
CLIENT: Pretty (inaudible at 00:00:36)
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: I had to take a cab here today because the bus didn't come. So I'm all flustered.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: At like 11 when the bus had not come, I was like, "Okay. That's it."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:00:54) Yeah. I can never figure out the schedules. I can never figure whether it's that I am not getting there at the right time or whether they're just running completely erratically. I think it's the latter. But - . Yeah. Applying for jobs yesterday was very hard. [00:01:25]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Yesterday was a pretty hard day. Yeah. (pause at [00:01:33] to 00:01:44) It's just like applying for jobs makes normal people feel worthless and helpless. So. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (laughs) Not so good for me. Yeah. I talked to James last night. He had some good suggestions for places to look today.
THERAPIST: Oh good.
CLIENT: But I — it's just hard to make myself do. (pause at [00:02:15] to 00:02:25) Yeah sorry I'm really not doing very well today. Like I woke up and I didn't want to get up. [00:02:35]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I was doing — striving forward for a little bit but I just don't quite have enough in me to - . (pause at [00:02:55] to 00:03:19) Yeah. I don't know what to talk about. I don't know what to say. I'm just —yeah. Maybe I should go get some paper towels. [00:03:35]
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: I can get them.
CLIENT: Okay. Thanks. (pause at [00:03:38] to 00:04:36) (crying) Thank you.
THERAPIST: I'll have the real thing tomorrow.
CLIENT: (laughs) I actually — I never buy tissues. Like ever, ever. So it always surprises me to see them in other people's houses. Another holdover from being raised by a dude.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: The tissues. (inaudible at 00:05:06) tissues. Leave the toilet seat up. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I feel like — the problem is that willpower can do a lot. It can get me through a lot. And so I can't — it's hard for me to recognize that it's not going to do everything. And that I can't just fix myself. It's hard for me not to blame myself for not being able to just power through. (chuckles) [00:05:47]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: (crying) I don't know what I'm going to do today. I don't know how to get through the day.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I mean I'll be fine. Realistically in thinking about past experiences, I'll get through the day fine. But —.
THERAPIST: Part of it is you're also not so sure how you're going to get through the next 40 minutes.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah but I'm not worried about that as much. I mean — (laughs). I feel less pressure on myself in here than I do anywhere else. [00:06:37]
THERAPIST: Well good.
CLIENT: So you know. (laughs) But yeah. You're right. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah I guess it seems to me you're at — really at odds with yourself about how much to power through and how much to fall apart.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause at [00:07:16] to 00:07:28) I just — I get so angry at myself for just falling apart ever. And I can't — (pause at [00:07:39] to 00:07:47). I can't tell when I'm going to and I'll think I'll be fine today. And then I'm really not fine. [00:07:58]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And then I'll think this is not going to well and then it's like things just lift. And it's great. But why can't I do that all the time? (pause at [00:08:10] to 00:08:36) (cries) And part of it is I'm supposed to kind of talk to you and tell you what I'm thinking but part of not falling apart involves just not thinking anything. [00:08:50] (pause till 00:09:31)
THERAPIST: We can sit quietly if you'd like.
CLIENT: (chuckles) (pause at [00:09:34] to 00:10:00) (sniffs) I don't know.
THERAPIST: Mm? [00:10:01]
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know what to do. (pause at [00:10:04] to 00:10:29) I just — I can't — It's one of those days where just I can't stand being myself. Or inhabiting my body. Being this person. But here I am. (sniffs) (pause at [00:10:46] to 00:10:56) Maybe days is too strong a word. Half-hour segments. (chuckles) [00:11:01] (pause to 00:11:19)
THERAPIST: I guess I can imagine that you on one side would like to let yourself fall apart and talk about it. But worried first of all, about the backlash for letting yourself do that. And also — which I think may come from feeling as though you, not consciously — I mean I don't think you consciously think this.
But [unconsciously] I suspect you do. Like done something harmful to me or wrong by being really upset. I know consciously that that's not how you think about it. But I think at another level you really worry about what being really upset does to the, or could do, to the people around you. That we really can't handle it or we really don't want to see it. [00:12:31]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or we're really going to be hurt. Or flustered or something.
CLIENT: Yeah. When I was 12 or 13 there was a night that I was really, really upset. I couldn't get to sleep. Everybody else was asleep. And I went out in the backyard — it was summer — and I just wanted to die. I didn't know what to do.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I was really upset.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Couldn't — I couldn't talk to my Dad about it. And so I called my Mom.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And she was with somebody. And said, "Okay, okay, okay. Let me talk to your Dad." And my Dad got so angry with me. He was furious. And nobody really actually paid any attention to the fact that I was really upset. [00:13:38] (pause to 00:13:56)
THERAPIST: What was he furious — was it that you hadn't talked to him? Or that you called her?
CLIENT: I think he was mad maybe that I hadn't talked to him. I think he felt like I undermined him to my mother. I don't know what my Mom said to him or not. But that I'd embarrassed him or something. (pause at [00:14:20] to 00:14:44) Yeah.
(pause at [00:14:44] to 00:14:55) So maybe you're right. It's hard for me to tell. I don't know why it's always been so much more important to me not to let people know that there's anything wrong than it has been to fix it. (inaudible 00:15:31) nothing to the way that I was when I was a kid. [00:15:33]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: Meaning you really wouldn't have let people know then?
CLIENT: Yeah. Like I didn't — I was seeing a therapist for like three or four years before I told her that I was depressed. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I would never—I tried really hard not to cry in front of people. I wasn't always successful. But I tried really hard. But I felt like if they knew that I was vulnerable they would hurt me.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: I mean that's what it felt like.
THERAPIST: How —
CLIENT: That's not what it feels like now.
THERAPIST: How would they hurt you? [00:16:37]
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know what I thought. (pause at [00:16:43] to 00:16:52) You know I was kind of whiny as a kid. So I got a lot of, "Stop whining." But a lot of it, I was whining because I was really fat. (laughs)
(pause at [00:17:06] to 00:17:37) Maybe it's just you know — we have 45 minutes and then I have to leave and put myself back together. Go on with the day. (pause at [00:17:50] to 00:18:05) It also just really hurts.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Absolutely. [00:18:14]
CLIENT: (sniffs) And I'm afraid of it. (pause at [00:18:25] to 00:19:05) (crying) I wonder how useful saying out loud the things—what I think when I'm like this is. You know because if you hear it, it makes it more real. [00:19:23] (pause to 00:19:35)
And it also is — you know it's both so absurd and feels so true. And that gap between what I'm pretty sure is actually the case and what I am convinced is the case—I can't. I don't know want to deal with that.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Like I have pretty hard time dealing with it. (pause at [00:20:06] to 00:20:37) (crying) Obviously I'm not a useless, hateful, worthless person. Because most other people don't seem to think so. And people take care of me because they want to. And [they may fix me]. And etcetera. But I can't shake it. [00:21:04]
THERAPIST: Worthless, hateful. What was the third one? Useless?
CLIENT: Useless. (pause at [00:21:14] to 00:23:40) (crying) It's so hard to live with this.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (sobs)
THERAPIST: Yeah (inaudible at 00:23:53).
CLIENT: I'm sorry?
THERAPIST: It's taking everything you've got. [00:23:57]
CLIENT: Yeah and I want to say I can't. I can't do this. I can't do this. But I am doing it. I do do it.
THERAPIST: Well those things can both be true.
CLIENT: I'm sorry?
THERAPIST: Those things can both be true.
CLIENT: (crying) The problem with the paper towels is they're very loud. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Oh. (laughs)
CLIENT: I guess — (pause at [00:24:33] to 00:24:48) (crying) (inaudible) I say I can't do this. I want this to stop. I don't want this to happen anymore. And that doesn't do anything. That doesn't make me different. I don't have any way of making it stop. [00:25:05]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: There's nothing I can do.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: (crying) Why isn't there anything I can do? That's a rhetorical question. Sort of. (crying and laughing) James and I have had a couple of conversations recently where I'll be upset and talking to him and ask him questions. And he will try to answer them. And it will turn out to have been rhetorical questions. (laughs) I'm trying to flag those (inaudible at 00:25:46)
THERAPIST: Thank you. (chuckles)
CLIENT: (laughing) (crying) (pause at [00:25:53] to 00:26:20)
THERAPIST: Why do you ask them rhetorically? I guess I have —
CLIENT: Because none of the answers are going to help. [00:26:28]
THERAPIST: - a theory. Yeah I think — I don't think. I think you're saying it's rhetorical in this case to like take the heat off of me.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And also in that way I guess to protect yourself from what you are pretty sure is going to be an answer that isn't good enough. Which is worse, I think, than not getting an answer in the first place?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: And —
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think that may encapsulate a lot. (pause at [00:27:11] to 00:27:20) About some of how you're dealing with how you feel. Like some part of you is speaking up about wanting to know what the fuck is going on. And is really wanting to make clear how awful this is and how unbearable. And you, in a sense for good reason, are confident that part is not going to get any help or any answers. But you can't bear, I think, not to say or not to ask. [00:27:59]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Although I think you kind of back off of that to sort of protect yourself and to protect the other person.
CLIENT: Yeah. That's all right.
THERAPIST: But it also keeps you at a distance. I think I guess that's an important thing that it does. It contributes to the distance between you and whomever you're talking to. In that — I'm not saying you're not living (inaudible at 00:28:42).
I take your point about, if you were here and whatever, eight or nine years old, I might not hear for years that you were upset about anything. I know. But nonetheless (pause at [00:28:56] to 00:29:10) We'll let's see. What you are protecting, in this case, me as well as you from? I guess it's the hurt and disappointment of my not knowing. And your anger about all of that. [00:29:27]
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I wouldn't be here if I didn't think that I could —
THERAPIST: I know.
CLIENT: If I didn't hope that I could be better.
THERAPIST: I know.
CLIENT: But I see what you mean.
THERAPIST: This is a short term thinking kind of thing if that makes sense.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause at [00:29:49] to 00:30:09) (crying) You were right to say, "What is going on here?" And you answer and I say, "No that's not good enough."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: That's making you responsible for something that you're not responsible for. (inaudible) [00:30:38]
THERAPIST: If we hold off on the realities for a minute —
CLIENT: (laughs) Okay.
THERAPIST: I guess it's making me responsible for something that at that moment it kind of feels like I ought to be responsible for. Or that you want me to be responsible for. There's the thing.
CLIENT: Yeah. I (inaudible at 00:31:00) anybody other than myself to be responsible for this.
THERAPIST: Sure. And okay. So — (pause at [00:31:11] to 00:31:25). And that's pretty sympathetic at least from a realistic grown up point of view. You don't want anybody else to be responsible for this.
CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. But I don't think anybody else is responsible for this. You know? This is all me. [00:31:44]
THERAPIST: It's more complicated than that.
CLIENT: I know. I can't shake it. I can't shake thinking that.
THERAPIST: I see. (client crying) Yeah I think you'd really rather not think about the ways in which I or James or your parents are responsible for this.
CLIENT: It just hasn't taken me very far in the past. You know? Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think that's in part because there is a point there where you stop.
CLIENT: Well it's just like saying, "Okay. So my parents were crappy parents in some ways. Great. And so what?" There's nothing to be done about that anymore. I don't know. (crying) [00:33:07] (pause till 00:33:30)
Everybody is just so fucking optimistic about depression. Everybody says, "Oh it'll get better."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: "Just gotta get the treatment you need. It'll get better." It's not getting better. (crying)
THERAPIST: No it's really not.
CLIENT: (crying) I do one thing with my life and I feel like crap. So and I think, "Well I've gotta change and do something else with my life." And then I still feel like crap. And then I do anything thing and I still feel like crap. (crying) Sometimes it's a mildly different kind of crap. But—. [00:34:20] (pause till 00:35:32) (crying)
I just think it's horrible to blame people for things that aren't their fault. And for (inaudible at 00:35:39) I still feel like crap. I really don't think it's anybody's fault. It's just still there. It's a problem. (pause at [00:35:47] to 00:36:35) (crying)
You know anyway I actually feel better when I see you. Not in the direct cause and effect sort of way. But like I feel better in general coming to see you. So like great. I don't want to dump (laughs) all of the other therapists I've ever had on you. I don't want to do that. [00:37:07] (laughs)
THERAPIST: What does that mean? Like I'm not sure what you're referring to about dumping all the other therapists. Like how useless they've all been? (laughs)
CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah basically. But it's not even true that they've been useless. I got myself out of an abusive relationship. I learned how to deal with conflict. I learned how to make friends. I learned how to make a place for myself in the world. Like most of that — therapy has helped me have a good life. But it doesn't take this away. (pause at [00:37:52] to 00:39:33) (crying)
THERAPIST: I suspect you had many conversations with therapists in which my ilk have talked to you or gone after your avoiding being angry. Is that true? [00:39:57]
CLIENT: More or less. (pause at [00:40:01] to 00:40:21) (crying) More when I was younger than as an adult.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (pause at [00:40:25] to 00:41:10) Yeah I think because I'm not sure what else to say about that at the moment.
CLIENT: Yeah. Although I mean it's more than figuring out how to say that I'm angry to people. Figuring out how to resolve conflicts in good ways and stand up for myself. [00:41:41]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause at [00:41:46] to 00:43:09) At this weekend when we were having dinner with our friends — both of them know about what's going on with me. And they're really good about it. Cody said, "Oh have you ever thought about —." He's kind of nuts. He's kind of been told a lot of different things. But he's like, "Well have you ever thought about following—." One of the more, esoteric, spiritual (inaudible at 00:43:42).
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: You know for like an analogy the spiritual exercises. [00:43:49]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And I got really angry at him for some reason. And I didn't say anything about it. Or I didn't show that I was angry. But it did tick me off. I said, "No I don't. I don't really use religion as a way to get me out of this."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I haven't found it helpful in the past.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (inaudible at 00:44:29) not hard to feel and sort of make it clear to him — I guess in some way that felt appropriate to —
CLIENT: Yeah I mean I didn't — it didn't feel appropriate to let him know that this question had offended me. [00:44:55]
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I guess (inaudible at 00:44:59) that it would.
CLIENT: (inaudible) kind person he is. Who just throws everything out.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible) Yeah.
CLIENT: And he's also somebody who is like — he lives his own life in a state of constant experimentation. So.
THERAPIST: (chuckles) Right.
CLIENT: (laughs) So it's very characteristic.
THERAPIST: Something he might — yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I guess I asked that because I felt sort of on the verge of getting caught up in something like that with you. With my waving my arms about how it seemed to me you were kind of avoiding — stopping short of you're being angry at people whom you may have felt at whatever level (inaudible at 00:46:09) should be responsible for you're feeling sad. But then it seemed to me like we get into some kind of (inaudible at 00:46:20) that were — I don't know. [00:46:28] (inaudible)
CLIENT: Yeah I don't feel like I'm upsetting you for saying that.
THERAPIST: Yeah kind of —
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:46:44)
THERAPIST: Yeah I'm thinking more like I can imagine you in a situation with a therapist or somebody else where they're talking about you avoiding being angry. And then you're feeling like you've done something wrong or should've done something different. And even though the discussion on the surface is about you sort of leaning on people or taking up more space with people, the way it's being conducted is kind of the opposite. That was my concern.
CLIENT: (laughing)
THERAPIST: But I don't know.
CLIENT: I don't remember any specific instances that happening but that does seem like a plausible way for things to go. [00:47:26] (laughs)
THERAPIST: (inaudible) about it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: In any case we should stop for now.
CLIENT: Yeah. Okay.
THERAPIST: But we'll talk more tomorrow. Yeah. [00:47:35] [End of audio]
