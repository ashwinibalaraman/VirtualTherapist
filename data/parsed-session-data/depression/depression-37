BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
PATIENT: I guess I'm done. 
COUNSELOR: What do you think about that? 
PATIENT: And it's quite possible that I could. I mean if I'd just do it. 
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.
PATIENT: It's just upsetting. To stop studying. I realized I do have ample time. 
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.
PATIENT: To prepare for the finals.
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.
PATIENT: And I don't know. I feel pretty good about it. Since I haven't messed it up yet.
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.
PATIENT: (inaudible) There's still --
COUNSELOR: You haven't cut off your options. 
PATIENT: And so I don't know. I just feel whole lot (inaudible) I sort of feel relaxed. Danger of me carrying out this relaxation for a couple weeks. (inaudible)
COUNSELOR: Mm. You could just let everything go. You're afraid of that. 
PATIENT: (inaudible) You just sort of have to cut out some relaxation altogether. (inaudible) better (inaudible) 
COUNSELOR: Does that seem to you like the only alternative to letting everything go? Letting nothing go for a minute?
PATIENT: Well it's not the only alternative. But I think it's a rather sure thing. (inaudible)
COUNSELOR: Sure thing. 
PATIENT: (inaudible) You know, if you don't let anything go, you (inaudible). Whereas well if you just let something go and relax a little, it's hard to tell where to stop. And when to get back to (inaudible)
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Like there's an extra decision involved. And it's very (inaudible).
PATIENT: Sensitive. Yeah. (inaudible) just like (inaudible) very uncomfortable. 
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: In a couple weeks I'll start to feel pressure from a lot of tests. (inaudible) very uncomfortable.
COUNSELOR: But your uncomfortableness you made such a function of whether there is immediate outside pressures on you. Like a test. (inaudible)
PATIENT: Well that's sort like (inaudible) me very, very tense. I'm just prone to get just really despondent. Really depressed. Just a normal, a standard, unhappiness. And negative (inaudible) normally have. But at least I can sort of relax with it for awhile.
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.
PATIENT: (inaudible)
COUNSELOR: Kind of a dull, a dull (inaudible) that's familiar and it's not (inaudible).
PATIENT: Well it's not that. I don't get real tense with it. (inaudible) It's not like (inaudible). (inaudible) pressure. 
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.
PATIENT: Real tense and sick to my stomach and stuff like that. I also (inaudible) sometimes. Not real bad ones. But (inaudible) to avoid that. (inaudible) real worked up inside.
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.
PATIENT: I'm catching a cold. (inaudible) (long pause) 
COUNSELOR: Like now, you're just in, you're kind of unhappy. You're kind of unhappy. Everything is kind of flat. But nothing is really tearing at you. Are you glad for that?
PATIENT: Nothing immediately (inaudible). 
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.
PATIENT: But I'm glad for that. (inaudible) 
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Not really. (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Not now. (inaudible) It'll have it's ups and downs.
COUNSELOR: Even this kind of unhappiness you mean?
PATIENT: Yes. 
COUNSELOR: Can be very painful to you? 
PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I just feel like punked out about myself. 
COUNSELOR: Mm. You talked about that before. I'm still not sure I really understand. There's nothing else to say?
PATIENT: Getting close to it.
COUNSELOR: Mm. Everything you said was kind of out there.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Mm.
PATIENT: It's just it's sort of like all that I knew how to talk about. (inaudible)
COUNSELOR: Mm. There are other things inside you but they aren't things you particularly have any words for. And-
PATIENT: It's (inaudible) talking about something I really don't understand at all. 
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.
PATIENT: You know like (inaudible) relationships with just people in general. And those sort of things. And you know I have no frame work for talking about it. I don't know how to get into it. 
COUNSELOR: Those are kind of separate things. Could be kind of separate things. We've seen them together. That you don't know how to get into it or introduce it or start talking about it. Can be seen as separate from whether you have a way of organizing the whole thing.
PATIENT: Mm-hmm. (inaudible)
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Mm?
COUNSELOR: Do you mind not having either a way of getting into it at all so that once you got into you wouldn't know how to structure it? 
PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) talk about it. It's just an awkward thing for me to talk about. 
COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. What's left is very confusing to you. 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And very vague.
PATIENT: Yeah. (long pause) I don't know. I just, (inaudible) talking about it. Because I've just sort of disregarded everybody from my mind already. (inaudible) something like that. I just sort of ceased to think about it.
