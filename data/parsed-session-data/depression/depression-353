BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: I had an appointment yesterday with the psychiatrist and for some reason I thought it was in the afternoon and I slept through it. I called and left a message to reschedule and she never called me back. I didn't have her number in my phone, but I used the number that they had at CVS and it was her voice mail. That was her first day back from vacation so she probably was a little [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:46) you know? I called twice. She didn't call me back. It doesn't seem like I have very much to do. There is stuff I could be doing—cleaning the house, getting things organized in the office, but I'm not motivated to do any of that. As far as real work, I don't have a whole lot. I could be doing some billing stuff, but not like billing people, but sending people with bills their money back and whatever. I don't know. Yesterday was a very weird day. I guess sometimes I wonder why everything is so hard, you know? Nothing seems to come easy. My insurance company canceled my umbrella policy, which—were you going to say something? [00:02:05]
THERAPIST: No. I didn't know what that means. 
CLIENT: Umbrella policy is basically a policy that puts all your policies into one and gives you like a million dollar liability or a two million dollar liability and, since I had multiple units for rent, I thought it would be a good idea. That's what I advise people to do; but because a woman backed into me in a parking lot, which they seem to be counting against me as my fault, and then I went ahead and dinged up the rental car and then Jess had gotten hit backing out of the driveway, which was her fault, they've decided we're too much of a risk and canceled the policy, which is just one more pain in the ass. I don't know if it cancels the auto insurance or the house insurance. I'm not sure with those. My bill for my insurance is like as if I'm insuring the cars so . . . It's just always something that beats me down just a little bit more. I realize I have these clients who had a bunch of money embezzled by their treasurer, like at least $28,000 that they know of. It could be more. I was thinking, "Oh, good, here's a nice paying client. They found money because the woman gave them like $25,000 back and they've got money. Then I realize they probably have insurance on their master insurance that probably covers this type of thing. [00:04:10] I already did a little bit of work so I said, "Send me a retainer and cover what I've already done and anything not covered by the insurance policy," like she may not have paid her condo fees or something like that. It's kind of how things are going even when it seems like something good is about to happen, something happens [ ]. (inaudible at 00:04:45) Today is going to be more of the same, actually less of the same because I have less work to do. One title I could do but I really don't feel like going up to the office. There's no reason to go. Maybe there are some checks waiting for me but that's not worth it. I've got to go up on Thursday, I'm meeting with you tomorrow, and it's a lot of spending time and money on gas. There's just no point being in the office so I'm at home bored. (pause) [00:06:16] I'm kind of pissed off at myself that I missed that appointment because we've lowered my medications again. There is some progress with my medications and now I don't know when I'll be able to see her again. I'll call her when I'm done here. Maybe she can see me today. I don't know how busy she is. How am I supposed to be able to get up and do my job if I can't get up? Their job is to make it so I can get up and do my job. There's a huge difference between [ ]. (inaudible at 00:07:22) 
THERAPIST: It's just not enough.
CLIENT: It probably is enough, but I didn't think I'd make it [to therapy. If I didn't have coffee ] (inaudible at 00:07:32) I saw the kids over the weekend. Ian spent the night on Saturday, which was mostly just spending time downstairs watching the Olympics but for the first hour and a half they had this thing on World War II, so he falls asleep right in the middle of it. We went to dinner and we were watching some of the Olympics on Sunday. It was just non-stop questions. It kills me. He [just kind of drives me crazy. ] (inaudible at 00:08:32) I went over and hung out with Lucille. When I first went to pick him up Jess must have said something like, "Oh, daddy's at the door." Ian must have said, "Oh, daddy's at the door." Ian always comes to greet me. Lucille comes to the door and holds her hands like this.
THERAPIST: Like a [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:01) 
CLIENT: Yeah. That was kind of nice. Then on Sunday she went back to being her own cranky "I want my mommy." I played with her a little bit. (pause) [00:09:39] I'm eating a lot. I've got vegetables that I kind of snack on all day but then like yesterday I went and got two sandwiches and a bag of chips. It was like, "What am I doing this for?" I've got the tournament next weekend, this coming weekend. I don't know if it's stress or boredom or both.
THERAPIST: I think you tend to feel kind of empty.
CLIENT: Yeah. Very empty.
THERAPIST: Which I think is mostly because you feel sad and angry. [00:10:47]
CLIENT: I just don't know when it's going to change. When? How? What? I can't seem to get my tenants to give me an answer yes or no whether they're renewing or not. Part of me says they don't have the money for first month's rent and security deposit. Make an effort paying me rent on time. They still owe me for—they paid July—but they still owe me for August. I'm holding $1500 security, so I don't know what—they're worried about us getting foreclosed on. I kind of reassured them saying, "We're in this really short-sale approval, not technically in foreclosure, and we're taking every step to avoid foreclosure, which is true." I just don't know what's going to happen with the short-sale. [00:12:00] I just don't know why business sucks. I've got these refi's that have just been sitting there. Nothing is happening on them. I've got to sell a [rep ] (inaudible at 00:12:21) in October. It's like you go through bankruptcy and it's supposed to be something positive, like the bottom, but it really hasn't been. I just sputtered from that. I haven't paid—I still owe my April payment on my student loans. I've got to come up with all kinds of money for pay the DOR and IRS. We've got to make an estimated payment next month, which is $1800, so there's $900 I've got to find. It's like I don't know where this money is going to come from. I just don't know. [00:14:07] I don't know if all the money from all the titles I do is going to dribble in or if I'm going to have to beg for the money again. They still owe me like $1700 with one really old title that's not going to close and I don't know what they're going to do about that. Like I recorded something for them which was $50, and so it's like just pay me the $50. I don't know. (long pause) [00:16:58] I have a therapy joke.
THERAPIST: Hit me.
CLIENT: A guy goes into his therapist's office and says, "Doctor, I think I'm a dog." He says, "Well, why don't you lie down on the couch?" "I can't. I'm a dog." Because he's a dog, he's not allowed on the couch. (both chuckle) We've always let our dogs on the couch. Some people don't like their dogs on the couch. [00:17:98]
THERAPIST: Hmm. (long pause) [00:20:17]
CLIENT: You seem like you have something you want to say.
THERAPIST: Tell me about how you've been feeling sad.
CLIENT: How?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I don't know. It has a lot to do with loneliness; not having work. 
THERAPIST: What's it like? [00:21:40]
CLIENT: I guess it depends when it is. Like at night I just lie on the couch staring at the ceiling. Sometimes I wonder when it is going to get better. Other times, why me? Other times I just want to drink. I tried that Sunday night but I couldn't even get a buzz because I ate too much. It's like I think about all these things. I've got to clean the house. I've got to do all these things. I've got ants and fruit flies and all kinds of shit. I don't know. What could I have done differently? If I knew then what I know now . . . (pause) [00:23:57] Could I have done anything different to save my marriage? Was it worth saving? Should I have even gotten married? I had a job offer to work at a firm I was working at full time. Should I have taken that? I turned it down. I listen to the radio. The radio is depressing. Commercials for credit cards and taxes and all the things people f**k up with. Low testosterone. How your life sucks and we're going to make it better, you know? Those commercials. They don't mention how to fix your student loans, but you know. Then you watch TV and it's all happy, successful stuff. It's like, "Buy this," except for those commercials from the Humane Society. Those are pretty sad. [00:26:00] I feel discouraged, you know? Sometimes I try to think of ways it might get better. Sometimes it just makes me sadder because I know it's not true. I think about how there are just more problems awaiting around the corner and things are going to get worse, not better. (pause) Is that what you meant? 
THERAPIST: That's all really a lot to bear. 
CLIENT: It's hard. 
THERAPIST: Absolutely. (pause) [00:30:06] Especially when you're in it so alone and it doesn't feel much like anyone cares.
CLIENT: That's what I was thinking. If I had someone who . . . that was the problem with Jess. I was an afterthought. It was always about the kids. Even when I was at my worst she couldn't find any way to be sympathetic. (pause) [00:31:23]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that would have made a huge difference if she had.
CLIENT: Things would have been a lot different. (pause) [00:32:41] The thing is I don't know what to do. 
THERAPIST: Well, you know what to do. You know you're feeling [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:29) (long pause) [00:36:55] What's on your mind?
CLIENT: I'm just wondering how much I can take. Would things be different if business was better? What would have happened if Barbara had said yes? People act as if it's a good thing—at least you're trying. The whole reason for getting shot down is the whole culmination of my problems.
THERAPIST: Like getting shot down reflects everything else that's wrong?
CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) [00:41:14] What's on your mind?
THERAPIST: Well, I think the main thing for you is not just being alone, it's not having anybody who is sort of caring and paying attention in that I think, while it can be good in some ways hanging around the kids because they're kids, it doesn't provide a lot of what you need. I'm not saying it's not good being with the kids, I'm just saying . . . 
CLIENT: After an hour or two I can't take them.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess my point is if it was just being by yourself, being with the kids would help a lot. In some ways I think it's good to see the kids, but it doesn't really help with a lot of what's so painful. I think this stuff with business sucks, but I think it's probably secondary in a few ways to how lonely you feel. I sort of have the fantasy in my head, which may or may not be true, that if you were dating somebody and it was going well, work would look different in six months somehow. I don't know, first of all, but I just have that feeling. Also that part of this feeling you have about expecting to be alone or deserving to be alone is to do with how shitty you feel about yourself because of work. [00:44:13] My main point, really, is that I think feeling alone and feeling like there aren't people around who are paying attention and care is just devastating. I'm not [ 
CLIENT: 
THERAPIST: ] (inaudible at 00:44:48) I think it's devastating. 
CLIENT: It's like I don't even know what I could do to change things. I don't know what I could do.
THERAPIST: Sure. I sort of think it's the other way around. I don't know what you can do to change things to be less alone, but I do think it's how overwhelming, sad mostly, frustrating also, it is. I think that spills over into a lot of other things. I think that's part of what makes it hard and makes you feel depressed. It makes it hard to do other things. It makes it hard to be patient. It makes it hard to motivate, and I think there's a difference between kind of recognizing it and having some perspective on it versus just being overwhelmed by it all the time. [00:47:15] (pause) We should close up for now. We'll talk more tomorrow.
