<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now, if I, um, remember right, you went, when did you go off, in the spring or the summer, the meds?
<b>PT:</b> Um, the spring, I think.  I think I May.
<b>DR:</b> Here we go, wait.  She feels less blah in 2 weeks, off the meds.  Yeah, sometime in the middle of May.  Um, all right. And you did well over the summer, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And, like so what happened?  Did you start to feel depressed or withdrawn or - 
<b>PT:</b> I felt like I was depressed all the time.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I didn't have that easy of a time last year either.
<b>DR:</b> No.  In terms of?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I mean, just it was difficult to be there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then did you have issues with keeping up with class or [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> No, I was doing okay with class.
<b>DR:</b> How about with friends and stuff?
<b>PT:</b> Well, near the end, my roommates like I don't know, decided that they didn't want me there any more.  Like once I mentioned to them that I was thinking about leaving, it's just they turned completely on me.  They had like took all my cooking stuff and threw it all on the counter and were like get out.  We don't want you any more.
<b>DR:</b> Last year?
<b>PT:</b> No, that was this year.
<b>DR:</b> Geez.  I mean, I wonder, did they, did they tell you you looked depressed?  Did they know?
<b>PT:</b> Well, 1 of the girls was like, I mean, I can tell from the past 2 years you definitely didn't want to be here [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> They all turned on you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, 1 of the girls was like I can't tell you to stay or to go because I know how you feel because she didn't really want to be there either and she [INAUDIBLE].  I don't even known why.  I asked her like, what did I do?  She wouldn't tell me.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you probably scared them or something.  I mean, I don't know.  So, did you end up not going to class?
<b>PT:</b> Near the end, yes.
<b>DR:</b> Was this some kind of feeling like you wanted to be doing something else, or you just needed to not be there?
<b>PT:</b> Both.
<b>DR:</b> Both?  Like you wanted to be somewhere else, or anywhere else.
<b>PT:</b> Anywhere else.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  I mean, so you've been home for what a week?  Not even a week. Couple of [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> A week.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Thursday it'll be two weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Two weeks.  Oh, okay.  Somewhere I'm missing a week.  All right.  Um, so when you first got, when did you go, in August sometime?
<b>PT:</b> End of August. 
<b>DR:</b> So they turned on you before you said you were leaving?
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, when I said I wanted to leave.
<b>DR:</b> Well, did they know you were gonna leave, or you just said you wanted to leave?  You don't know.  That's really strange.  So, um. How many roommates?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So, when it first started, what was the first couple days of the week like?  Did you feel like you wanted to be there?
<b>PT:</b> When I got there?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and now.
<b>PT:</b> It was fine, like the first, um, 3 weeks then once I started getting into [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You're upset enough.
<b>PT:</b> I just [INAUDIBLE] and I thought maybe it was because I didn't like my classes so I was gonna change my major and then I decided not to change the major.  I just decided to come home and go to, and then I would go to [INAUDIBLE] in January because, um, the major I was gonna change it to, there, over there it's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> What, what were, what were you majoring in?
<b>PT:</b> I was majoring in early childhood education and elementary [INAUDIBLE] education.
<b>DR:</b> Um, so, what are you gonna do, are you still thinking about [INAUDIBLE] in January?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, my mom's gonna [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Are you gonna do physical education there?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You can transfer your credits.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So what other classes are you taking, or what classes are you taking this semester?
<b>PT:</b> English, um, regular English [INAUDIBLE] and like a science class where you learn how to teach science, math is the same way, learn how to teach it.  Um, basic just like education class, for class teaching, and, um, oh, art [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Do you like any of them, or - 
<b>PT:</b> I liked art surprisingly.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> I thought it was interesting [INAUDIBLE].  I hated English.  I can't stand reading at all, ever.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> That's all it was, it was like, [INAUDIBLE] and log pages every single day.  I hated it.  That's one I stopped going to right away.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I mean, you've always hated reading?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Like I, I liked to read what I choose to read when I wanna read, it's enjoyable but other than that, I hate it.
<b>DR:</b> Like, um
<b>PT:</b> Like I had high school teachers who always said they hate how students hate reading [INAUDIBLE] growing up like in elementary school you were forced to read.  Like kids weren't taught to read for fun.  They always said they hated that because all their students wanna take reading.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, um, well, what's the last book you read that was your choice, what you liked?
<b>PT:</b> It was called The Pilot's Wife.  I read it over the summer.
<b>DR:</b> What was it about?
<b>PT:</b> It was about a guy who's a pilot who flies from here to like an island and [INAUDIBLE] a lot and he dies in a crash and they didn't know what happened.  They thought it was like suicide or something.  It ended up that he had a whole other family in Europe with like kids and everything and he had another one in America and he started doing, like smuggling stuff back and forth and if you don't know what they put in your bag and it ended up being a bomb and it killed him.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> God.  Um, so, this was somethin' that was layin' around at the pool?
<b>PT:</b> No, my mom had read it.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, do you ever pick stuff up and start reading it and say blah until you find something else?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Hm?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean, I don't read a lot.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, okay.  What did you have to read for English?  What was the first book [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> A [INAUDIBLE] book about Native Americans or something.  It was a book this thick called like [INAUDIBLE] or something and it was all these short stories, like poems and stuff about like really old people, like pilgrims.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And, you read some of it or try to read some?
<b>PT:</b> I tried to read most of it because we had quizzes every day so I had to read it.  I was still, I would read it and I would still fail.
<b>DR:</b> Hm, hm.  So, as you're reading it, what would be going on in your mind?  It would just be all of a sudden like, you have no idea what you were reading or - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, mostly.
<b>DR:</b> Did you have to read it over and over?
<b>PT:</b> I felt like an idiot because I felt like the only 1 who didn't know what was going on.  [INAUDIBLE] districted or like
<b>DR:</b> You probably were, what you were feeling you probably were much more easily districted than usual.
<b>PT:</b> And that was the problem with math class, too.  I didn't realize what was going on.  I'm always really good during math.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, were you able to follow the teacher, able to pay attention?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] English.
<b>DR:</b> Huh?
<b>PT:</b> The math teacher didn't speak good English.  It was very broken.  Everybody else was [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well, maybe you might have been less, you were feeling less depressed, maybe you would've been able to teach yourself.
<b>PT:</b> I usually can.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um, so, do you ever like forget to do assignments?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No.  Do you write them down somewhere?  Pretty organized?  Do you lose things?  Keys, cell phone? No?
<b>PT:</b> No. [INAUDIBLE]. Never had a loss [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um, were you ever like runnin', runnin' out of the house in the morning and be like ah, what did I do with my shoes, or somethin' like that?  You couldn't remember where you put your shoes, you've got to look for them, or?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, shoes, yeah, [INAUDIBLE] was normal.
<b>DR:</b> What's your room look like?
<b>PT:</b> Right now, it's horrible.  I haven't finished unpacking anything.  Like goin' out into the hallway and my mom is giving me such a hard time about [INAUDIBLE] my room and it's stressin' me out.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, what about when it's, when normally it's not all this stuff in the way?
<b>PT:</b> It's always messy.
<b>DR:</b> It's always messy.  Do you know where things are?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, my mom [INAUDIBLE].  It's messy, but I know where everything is.  Unless I clean it, I can't find anything.
<b>DR:</b> That's what I was gonna ask.  If you put it away, it's gone.
<b>PT:</b> Yea. On the floor, I know exactly what pile it's in.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um, hmm.  How long were your classes, like an hour?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] they were 50 minutes and I had 3 classes.  [INAUDIBLE] like an hour and 15 minutes.
<b>DR:</b> So, did you have trouble sitting through the whole class Tuesday and Thursday?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?  Is that abnormal or normally
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  In high school, they were like an hour and a half, all of them.  And I find it hard to sit there for an hour and 15 minutes, but I did in high school.
<b>DR:</b> But you had some trouble in some of the classes in high school?
<b>PT:</b> No, in high school it was fine.  [INAUDIBLE] be more engaged, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe.  I mean, it sounds like that's not, at this, at that point, it wasn't possible.  Somethin', so you were doing a lot of crying?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Every day?
<b>PT:</b> Mostly when it came to the weekend.
<b>DR:</b> The weekends?  Lonely?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I didn't wanna be there drinking all the time and that's all my roommates did.  They would drink themselves to the point where they didn't know what they did that night and I just hated that.  And they would get mad at me because I wasn't drinking with them.  I just never wanted to be there [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Did you ever do that?  Like drink to the point where you had no idea what you did?
<b>PT:</b> I don't do that often.  Like sometimes [INAUDIBLE].  I mean, once I did it, I immediately didn't want to do it again.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you're sick the next day, or just 'cause you - 
<b>PT:</b> I just don't like that feeling of not [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean, potentially, yknow, it's dangerous 'cause you don't know what you're doing and anybody can do whatever they want with you or to you or whatever.  Um, all right, are you restless a lot?  Like antsy?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].  It's really hard for me to sleep at night.  I don't [INAUDIBLE] to bed when I'm really tired.
<b>DR:</b> Because?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Your mind?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  And the medicine you gave me, I just haven't gotten a prescription for it yet, so [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> The, um - 
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That's helping.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Um, now which, you haven't gotten the Lexapro filled?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Um -  
<b>PT:</b> It made me feel too lazy.  I didn't like it.
<b>DR:</b> Let's not use it.  We'll use something else.  You just didn't feel motivated, or?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  People said my personality was changing.
<b>DR:</b> If I give you something else, and people tell you that, you need to tell me because you'll be off it in a second.  I'm not gonna, yknow, I'm sure you'd like to have your personality, yknow?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, so, all right?  You'll tell me?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, all right, so, how much, um, Gabitril do you want?  One at night?
<b>PT:</b> I think it's for 2 of the smaller mg ones.  I still have those - 
<b>PT:</b> I had them filled before, so I was taking 2 of those.
<b>DR:</b> Two of those, okay.  Are you taking like an hour before bed or somethin' or bedtime and then if you don't, with this, when you're really tired, you need to go to sleep, or that's without this?
<b>PT:</b> Without it, if I'm not really tired.
<b>DR:</b> But this helps, you can sleep with this.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And you feel rested in the morning.
<b>PT:</b> Pretty much.  At school, I was waking up a lot in the middle of the night, but I haven't had that problem.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Okay, let's see.  Um, I believe that, um, you, your family history has lots of, um, depression and whatnot.  Um, you don't have any idea who's on what meds, like what meds have worked for whom or
<b>PT:</b> Well, my mom [INAUDIBLE] for my dad.
<b>DR:</b> That's what I mean, I mean who stated it, but other than that.
<b>PT:</b> I only know, my sister's on Prozac and Ambien.
<b>DR:</b> Does that work for her?
<b>PT:</b> I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Does she seem like normal personality? Um.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] was Zoloft and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Who said that?
<b>PT:</b> My mom and my brother, he was [INAUDIBLE].  He took something else, too.  I don't remember.
<b>DR:</b> Um, Wellbutrin, anybody been on that?
<b>PT:</b> I don't remember.
<b>DR:</b> Who has, somebody has ADHD, your brother?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] is ADD.
<b>DR:</b> ADD.  Um, did anybody ever ask you or talk to you about possibly having that?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No.  I mean, I have no idea.  I'm just wondering, what do you think?  Is that possible?
<b>PT:</b> I seriously [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You do, why?
<b>PT:</b> Well, my cousin has ADHD [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Behavioral stuff?  Like crazy, wild?
<b>PT:</b> No, like [INAUDIBLE] bounce off walls [INAUDIBLE] and [NAME OTHER] was just, I don't know.  He's not like that any more.  I only remember what he was like as a child.
<b>DR:</b> Is he on medicine?
<b>PT:</b> No, he's not.  
<b>DR:</b> I mean.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> The reason I'm asking is that obviously you have these depressive kind of symptoms so you can't really, yknow, evaluate thoroughly but things, I have ADHD and I used to be, eh, bouncing off the walls and did some crazy things that somehow I managed to stay alive.  I'm not sure how, but.  It's only been about 6 years that [INAUDIBLE] being on medicine and actually do this instead of running around the homeless schizophrenics, like driving around crazy [INAUDIBLE].  Um, uh, no, I mean, some of the things, now what I think I'll do is I'll give you some stuff to look at.  I'm not saying you do, but I'm wondering if part of the reason that, some of the things, let's say that I noticed, are that if you can't see it, it doesn't exist.  Yknow, if you don't like it, you take so much energy to force yourself to do something, whatever subject it is, reading or something, as opposed to if you like something, you just do it.  You can do it for hours and hours.  Um, and it's, it's kind of frustrating and in some ways, I mean, it may be worthwhile looking later at that.  Okay, I mean, it's you may very well not, but I'm just wondering.  All right, now you need a letter, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And do you know what I'm supposed to - 
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  The lady said saying that [INAUDIBLE] better if you not do this [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> All right, we'll get [NAME OTHER] in a minute.  All right, so I think what I'll do is um, well, you can, you can talk with her.  I mean Prozac would be a good possibility if it's helping your sister.  Wellbutrin, I mean, do you feel like you're dragging during the day?  Tired?
<b>PT:</b> I've been sleeping a lot.  It's like all I do.
<b>DR:</b> Um, you, I mean, Wellbutrin might be a little more activating possibly.  I can, yknow, I'll ask your mother if she knows anybody that's been on it.  Maybe that would be a good, yknow, suggestion.  So, we could go get her, you want me to go get her?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> All right, well, you come back with her okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  I'm gonna use the Wellbutrin and talk to the mother about the letter now that's outside this interview [INAUDIBLE] that signed, so that's it.
