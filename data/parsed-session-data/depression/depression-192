BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> I'll let you start out by telling me how you've been doing?
<b>PT:</b> Well just, just going through the motions, I'm not living. I'm just sort of going through the motions of existing.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think it's ever gonna get any better. I mean, it seems like some days I can yknow, look at a little television and get it off my mind and then some days I just lay around or sit around, I just can't do anything hardly.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> It's just on my mind constantly.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And when I see something, yknow like I've not yet been able to look at things on television that he liked, that we used to look at and I used to love that, we both loved that show [DEIDENTIFIED] that come on, on Tuesday nights?
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And uh he liked that doctor [DEIDENTIFIED] and when I heard the shot I looked, I can remember what I saw was that [DEIDENTIFIED] face on television, it was on and I haven't been able to look at that and then that song that he liked so good, they started out playing it. It's by that [NAME OTHER] and I can't think of the name of it, but they play it now just about every time I with that, yknow, talk about the dogs you know wanting you to adopt an animal, what is it [DEIDENTIFIED] or whatever, I don't know, and I can see him, I get out of the room when it comes on, cut it off and get out of the room, but I can see him sitting at the computer with his eyes closed singing along with that song. He loved that song. I tried to find it or got some of the, tried to find it cause he always said that he wanted it played at his funeral, but I couldn't find it nowhere. I couldn't remember name of it, nobody knowed anything, but I'm still trying to find it and I'll take it up there at the grave, but I can't, I just don't know the name of it and they don't tell it on television, the nine, but uh, I just sittin around look like, I know my family tries to help me, but I don't want to tell em they do more harm than good cause they expect me to do and I go ahead and try to do things, but yknow, inner conversations or go out with them or something, but it just don't work, it just don't work. It's been six months.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And it seems like it just happened yesterday and it uh, as I come in the door out there your waiting room, that brown chair, that's the one he always sat in you know, this is foolish, I know it is, but I thought Lord I wish I had that chair in my house and I sit in it all the time because that's the very chair he'd. If I'd forgotten and sorta sit, he'd say let me sit there, and I don't know what about that chair, but he liked it.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But uh.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping at night?
<b>PT:</b> Yes that Restoril makes me rest. I don't realize it, it don't dope me up yknow like yknow some things would, but I can take it and then in about thirty or forty minutes I get to feeling a little bit sleepy but not real sleepy, but when I go to bed, go to bed, I try to pray and I try to talk to [NAME OTHER]. I'm sound asleep and don't realize it, so it really helps and then I wake up in the morning and I'm not yknow drowsy or anything, but now I take my Xanax during the day and my pain pills, I have to take them. I'm getting to where my legs and feet just hurt and my hip hurts so bad, but my Restoril and I don't think I could be on any other medication that would yknow help me anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>PT:</b> Than my Xanax and my pain pills and my Restoril, but some nights if I don't uh if I yknow maybe it's late take a Xanax I wait and not take one well maybe I can go to sleep without taking a Restoril, but I, and some nights I do but uh, I always wake up a little early, which is fine, I hope I never have been one to sleep real late or want to sleep real late, but then some days I oh I got um, um, um oh Lord, lift chair, yknow, my legs bothered me so bad and I can't get up and down out of the chair hardly and this vocational place thing called me, I don't know, I can't, I forget now how they knew, but anyway they got Medicare and I got me a lift chair yknow, remote.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And sometimes I sleep in it because it lays you all the way back and uh then I'll go to sleep maybe with the television on, it'll wake me up and I'll get up and go to bed, but without my medicine, without any of it, I'd never make it, but uh I still yknow I just don't feel like I'm living and it's not nothing like, like it was. I know [NAME OTHER] suffered all his life with Bipolar. I lived with him and I know how he done, but how it was with that Bipolar and manic depression, oh Lord have manic depression and then uh I knew he had a lot of friends, but he thought he didn't have no friends, but if only he knew how many friends that had called and was at his funeral, I mean people that, some of them I didn't even know. Some of them he went to school with, some yknow, that he was just friends with, but the cemetery was full of people that knew him and they've called me and they've been, yknow, try to be supportive and all you know, but when they talk about him they cry and yknow, that don't help me much and but I'm trying [PHYSICIAN NAME], I really am. I know there's nothing that I can do about it, but sometimes I think about Lord was it my fault. Did I do something when I was pregnant with him to make him you know be like that, but I didn't, I've never drank.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I've never done illegal drugs, I've never done anything like that, always took him to church or my mama would if I had to work on Sunday, I didn't get to take him, but she would take him. He always went to church when he was little and uh he knew the Bible from front to back, ask him anything about the Bible and he knew it and uh explain it to you and things, I mean, yknow, he was very smart, he had a high IQ, but he just couldn't, you'd think yknow, that I don't know why I believe that, but you'd think he wouldn't be as depressed and everything with an IQ like that but he, he, he was very smart but he just couldn't cope.  He just couldn't cope with the way things were.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And uh he did try things, yknow to try to get better and but I just uh and yknow another thing that worries me, I went down there on [DATE] at the monument place and his daddy uh helped me buy and uh marker, stone yknow and yknow they never got it there yet and I got my receipt and so I read in the paper, or my brother read it and called me and said that he had sold that monument place and it scared me cause I mean it been so long and uh like I never got in touch with him and I called the, they changed names at that monument place and I uh, asked them and they said we don't have anything to do with it and so I finally called every name that was his in the book and got hold of him and he said that yes he had sold it but he was gonna honor that for me not to worry about the money yknow and all but now that's been about a month and he said that he would get it just as quick as he could but yknow that's been long enough and his daddy got all upset about it and got aggravated at me like it was my fault and uh I told him I said if you don't hear anything pretty soon I said how about you handle it and he's got an awful temper and he said I will I'll handle it, while he's laying on the ground and things like that, stupid, and uh I said well I just can't handle much more, I said I've had just about all I can take and uh so I thought well I'd give him yknow lot of people be on vacation next week and I thought well I'll give him another week and then I'm gonna do something, I don't know what, but I'll have to do something because it wasn't really a whole lot of money but it was a whole lot to me and uh, but more so than that, I want him to have a marker and uh I go over there once a week to the grave and I talk to him and uh then I'll, if, every night when I'm praying I pray for comfort and uh then, then it seems like afterwards I feel yknow better, a little better and it seems like maybe I'm in the bathroom or in the bedroom or something and I'll hear something and maybe it's like something fell or just a step or little something like that and I just feel like it's [NAME OTHER] up here, just like it's him and that makes me feel a little better. Some people say you mean you want to see him, of course I want to see him, of course, I just don't understand people, yknow, being scared is the way they sound. Well I'm not scared. I would give anything to completely see like the first time like that shadow, I know it was him and I read the Bible and I can't, my eyes are real bad, I got to have cataract surgery some day and I read the Bible and I try to think that uh uh if it says anything about uh well it does speak of spirit and I just wondered if that was a way that God has for comforting me and uh I just uh but seems like my family when I talk about it, they don't want to talk about it, I mean, I don't know if it's for me or for them.
<b>DR:</b> It's probably for them.
<b>PT:</b> What?
<b>DR:</b> It's probably their way of dealing with it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but yknow that preacher told me that people have different ways of dealing with things, yknow, but I was with him all his life and I took care of him and I was with him when he was sick and I know all he's been through with all his life, see I never knew what to expect that when he'd have, when he'd be feeling pretty good and then all of a sudden he'd have one of his awful panic attacks and it's just like I was all his life, just like I was waiting for the shoe to fall and, but I did everything I could for him, but it seemed like he thought nobody cared anything about him. He said what am I gonna do if you go before I do? I said [NAME OTHER] I said I done talked to all of them and uh got some things fixed up, I said you've got nothing to worry about.  I said uh, he said I don't want to live after you, I said I'm just killing myself and things like that, but I had him to where he yknow thought he could make it yknow and he thought, that's another thing, I've never seen any boy and we've talked about this, having more girlfriends than he's had all his, ever since he's been old enough today and uh and they really cared for him.  This one girl I wanted him to marry so bad and she's the nicest Christian girl and he just didn't love her, always said there ain't no chemistry there and she came, called him and talked to him when he was real sick and then she came to his funeral and she cried so hard and, and if he could just know how many people really cared for him, but he didn't think they did so.
<b>DR:</b> Well that's why it's important to tell those things to people when you're around them.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Now [PATIENT NAME] do you, when was the last time you went to your primary care doctor?
<b>PT:</b> A what?

<b>PT:</b> And even [NAME OTHER] when he had, when he died he had uh whole bottle of Valium or Xanax and when I throwed it away, all his other medicine I throwed them away and then I thought well no I won't put that in the garbage, it's a whole bunch and I flushed it down the commode and then throwed the bottle away. I didn't even keep them. Now I, I forgot to got to tell you, I've got oh what is that?

<b>DR:</b> Okay so we'll just do that -
