BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> All right, how are you doing?
<b>PT:</b> I think I'm a little bit, I think I'm getting worse to be honest with you.  I, my mind runs like it's, like it won't stop, it won't stop thinking.
<b>DR:</b> You're worried or?
<b>PT:</b> Like I'm, I'm always worried about not being able to walk.  I mean my legs are to where they hurt constantly.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I take the medication and my arms hurt, my back, my stomach is all upset, sometimes I get constipated, I feel like vomiting, I don't really get to sleep that much.  I feel like I don't even know myself.  I was always an outgoing woman.  I was always, I wouldn't let nothing get me down.
<b>DR:</b> You've been pretty active all your life?
<b>PT:</b> All my life, all my life, I mean with nine kids I had to.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I know, nine children.
<b>PT:</b> And my kids tell me that they don't even know me and it's, it's just pain, like a constant habit, I can't even drive hardly because my back goes to hurting, my legs, my knees, and I stay active, yknow, I keep walking or doing laundry, mopping, doing something just to ease the pain but I can still feel it and it brings a lot of depression on me and unhappiness and they did all kind of tests.  They did that, when they do your spinal, your whole bone test, whatever, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] ordered it and the lady that did it told me that I have, I have started that, something where your bones go to getting thinner.
<b>DR:</b> Osteopenia?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, osteoporosis.
<b>DR:</b> So you have osteoporosis.  You had that bone scan done?
<b>PT:</b> And she -
<b>DR:</b> DEXA scan, it was done here?
<b>PT:</b> Here.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] ordered it.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And the lady told me, she said you better start taking a lot of vitamins and -
<b>DR:</b> Calcium.
<b>PT:</b> Calcium, she said, because your, you do have a sign of osteoporosis.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And she said ask the doctor about a pill for the bone but it has to be a prescription.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And that's worrying me.  I don't know if that's why I'm feeling tired because of my bones, I mean they hurt and it brings a lot of depression to you.
<b>DR:</b> Of course.
<b>PT:</b> To me, you know, because I'm not used to it.
<b>DR:</b> I know.  So the medication I gave you last time you came to me, we increased your Prozac, that didn't do anything.
<b>PT:</b> No, my mind it just runs, it just -
<b>DR:</b> It runs, means you're worried or are you constantly flipping like one thought and then you start a whole new thought, you get a different thought?  Is that kind of -
<b>PT:</b> One moment I can see things and I can see things in a happy mood and then I just turn around and that happiness is gone, like no that's not going to work, no that's not going to be, it's not me, it's not for me, it's not going to bring me any kind of different, I don't have the relationship with my children like I used to, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you live with your four children, right, they are still with you, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, uh-huh, but I'm not close to them like I used to be and, yknow, they tell me that we don't even know you anymore, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> So you are just trying to stay away from them?
<b>PT:</b> I kind of -
<b>DR:</b> Keep a distance.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, you know, I kind of just, I cook and I clean and I do everything that needs to be done, send them to school, pick them up, stuff like that, but I used to go to parks with them and picnics and swimming and stuff like that and that's like, like it's gone and I don't know if my, I don't know if my husband of thirteen years did something to me when he hit me in my head, that he did something to my brain or something, I've never been the same mentally and then all of the sudden this problem with this pain, it just won't leave.  
<b>DR:</b> And you're still with the tingling and numbness and all?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, like right now, I can feel.
<b>DR:</b> Like you told me last time, remember?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, sometimes I feel like asking for a parking permit, handicap parking permit because it's, when it's raining and stuff, it's hard for me to get from one place to another and by the time I get to the car it's so hard to get into my truck or bending down to get in the car and my shoulders go to hurting, even when I'm in the store, you know, so like I just want to get in there and get, I don't even like toting a purse because it hurts my shoulder to carry a purse.  Maybe I overpack my purse or something but I used to carry, lug everything in my purse and it never bothered me and now my, I carry a little wallet instead.  I don't know, I have a little treadmill because they tell me to keep going, you know, exercise your bones, so I have a little treadmill that I bought to do that and I have the little arm weights and hand balls and I walk, I try to walk.  I used to be able to walk like an hour and a half and now I'm probably down to an hour, sometimes even forty minutes, thirty minutes.
<b>DR:</b> Now because of the pain or the tired?
<b>PT:</b> No the pain and I get out of breath, I get out of breath and I do it in the afternoon, sometimes I do it early in the morning and I don't know what's wrong with me.
<b>DR:</b> How are you sleeping at night?
<b>PT:</b> Really, I think I get approximately like maybe three to four hours sleep when I go to sleep.  If I'm going to really really get to sleep, I have to take two Tylenol PM to get to sleep and that will probably take maybe like an hour an hour and a half to really really kind of drowse me to go to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> But then you do sleep all night?
<b>PT:</b> No, I know I turn a lot.  I turn a lot and I have to move the pillows.  I have to move the pillows around and turn on the other side.  Especially, I have to put pillows between my legs and sometimes I've got to move around, get a bigger one
<b>DR:</b> Because you're in pain or something?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah because sometimes, I have this one pillow that I keep there but like if, I believe it just depends on my pain, I believe it depends on my pain that I feel and I switch them around, especially when I turn on my left side.  If I sleep on my back, just flat on my back, oh that's even worse.
<b>DR:</b> Really.
<b>PT:</b> If I sleep flat on my back.
<b>DR:</b> How are your crying spells, are they any better.  The last time you told me.
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm always crying.
<b>DR:</b> Still forgetful, how's your memory?
<b>PT:</b> Lately I've been reading a lot, trying to focus on stories that I've read, stories when I was growing up that I, stories that my sons have read in school and we go to talking about them to see if I remember and stuff like that but it looks like, I used to be a person that was interested in social studies and science and about medicine, the law.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Those things are just, those desires are just disappearing, like I have no interest in them and my kids will tell me, mom help me with social studies, yknow, you know about this and I help them but it's like the interest isn't there.  I feel like I'm like telling them what I'm supposed to tell them, like I'm going to confuse them or I feel like I'm going to give them the wrong kind of information for their, for their test, like a social studies test or something.  I feel like I have this little fear that I don't know what I'm talking about.
<b>DR:</b> So you're feeling lack of confidence?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's something new.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and then I could be, I could be driving and it's like my mind just go, I forget that I'm even driving. 
<b>DR:</b> Do you get lost in familiar places or no?
<b>PT:</b> I know that, if I see the area and I know where I'm headed it's fine but if I take a wrong street, I feel like I get scared if I don't know where I'm at, where I'm going to end up or if I'm going to get out of there, especially if the car messes up, my mind is telling me, you know, if I get a flat tire, I'm changing into something, to someone I don't know.  
<b>DR:</b> Still paranoid?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I feel like I'm, I feel like I'm losing my mind.  I don't know if I'm coming or going or.
<b>DR:</b> How long have you been feeling depressed this bad?
<b>PT:</b> Maybe like, like a good two months that it really has hit me, three months, maybe when I couldn't keep up with my job, you know.
<b>DR:</b> You're not working anymore are you?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> How long has it been you're not working?
<b>PT:</b> It's been since, it's been since July, no, excuse me, probably the middle of April.
<b>DR:</b> What kind of job did you have?
<b>PT:</b> I had a job that kept me going.  I tended a laundry mat.  I wanted to stay busy and mop floors and sweep and take care of customers and iron, things I do at home.
<b>DR:</b> And how long did you have that job?
<b>PT:</b> This July would have been a year, yeah, this July would have been a year.
<b>DR:</b> And you could not do it because of your legs?
<b>PT:</b> Because of my legs, my pain and even though I stayed busy, I had to stay busy constantly and then I would actually forget what I was doing and give them back change, what the customer wanted done with his laundry, you know, what he wanted ironed and not ironed.  I remember one time I put bleach in the wrong washer.  I put, and I saw the clothes, I saw the clothes that they were color, but I still put bleach in it and it ruined everything that was in there because it had bleach in it but I saw the clothes and -
<b>DR:</b> You probably were too preoccupied, who knows.
<b>PT:</b> And the mopping, the sweeping got to where it got too bad for me, especially my knees, for me to be standing up that long.  You know, you can sit down, you can sit down at times to iron or if we didn't have any customers but then it was sitting, I just felt like I was locked up, there was nothing to do, you know, no customers, no laundry, no nothing, I felt like I was paranoid like I had to get out of there, do something and so finally I just told her I couldn't so I left.
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] saw you, right?  What do they think about this numbness?  You don't have diabetes or anything, right?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> There is a strong family history of depression?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, depression is real bad our family and my mom had open heart surgery four times.  She had like four strokes.  She had high blood pressure.  Her kidney's failed, she was on dialysis, sugar, she was going blind.  She could barely hear.
<b>DR:</b> She's alive or?
<b>PT:</b> No she died at the age of [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> And wasn't, how about your sister?
<b>PT:</b> Oh the one that she, she killed herself.
<b>DR:</b> One sister killed herself.  How did she kill herself?
<b>PT:</b> Pills. 
<b>DR:</b> How old was she?
<b>PT:</b> Probably like [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> [AGE].
<b>PT:</b> About [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> And you do have one more sister?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's older than me, she's older, she's [AGE].  Oh yeah, she's an alcoholic.  She tried to kill herself as well with alcohol poisoning they called it.  The ambulance took her to the hospital.
<b>DR:</b> Is she on medicine right now?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, she won't talk to us, very very little communication.  She was admitted to a mental institution for two weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Where is she at?
<b>PT:</b> She's in Georgia.
<b>DR:</b> But you have ten more siblings, there were ten children, right, in the family?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  I have another sister that is, she's probably [AGE], [AGE], and she tried to commit suicide.  She cut her veins over, over a man, over a man.
<b>DR:</b> She's also in Georgia.  Is she on medicine too?  How is she doing?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I believe she's doing pretty bad now because she just had a baby that was born with Down's syndrome.
<b>DR:</b> Oh really?
<b>PT:</b> So I don't think, I don't think she's too good, too well.  
<b>DR:</b> And what about your physical health except for gallbladder and nine deliveries, right, nine?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, nine deliveries, one C section, my gallbladder removed, my accident when I was a little girl that I stayed in the hospital like fourteen months because of my accident.
<b>DR:</b> What kind of accident was it?
<b>PT:</b> It was a car wreck.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But I never had problems with my bones, never, until, until now.  The lady told me about that osteoporosis, that there was a sign of it in my lower back, you know, that really took me downhill and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] hasn't called me yet about it.  I don't know if she's gotten the records or not.  
<b>DR:</b> You don't have a follow up appointment with her?
<b>PT:</b> She gave me some pain medication and some other prescription and told me to follow up with her in four months.  I know it's got to be before four months.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you need to maybe make a new check up.  We'll have you come see back her again, sooner than four months, so at least she can address the osteoporosis, see if we need to put you on Fosamax or some kind of medicine for your osteoporosis. I do know how much, how bad it is and that it requires it but.  You still get your periods or not?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes women hit menopause and your estrogen levels goes down, then the calcium really shows up bad so.
<b>PT:</b> Really?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so, let's just get you with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in four months and see if she can put you on some medicine or at least follow you up with that.
<b>PT:</b> This, I have the name of it, this lady, that lady that I was talking to, she used to be a nurse and I was talking to her at the, where did I meet her, oh at the insurance office.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And she was telling me, she said she was a nurse and she was telling me about the kids and stuff and she asked me how old was I and I told her.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I told her about my children.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And she said why do you keep grabbing your knee, rubbing on your knee, it's because they hurt, my legs hurt, for some reason my bones all over.  I'm always kind of like in pain and she gave me this name of this, of this sickness or something.  I wrote it and I left it inside my car.  She said what other problems do you have and I told her about upset stomach, sometimes real bad constipation, the pains in my bones, my back, the standing, the breathing, yknow, hard sleeping and my mind, that my mind runs, it's constantly going.  I think that's why I can't sleep because I can, I can try to go to sleep and I'm worried about little things.  I worry about little things.  I worry about something that I have to do probably next month and my appointments, about me getting to my appointments on time, you know, sometimes I might be here twenty, thirty, forty minutes before I'm supposed to be here.  I don't know if it's, I know it's me, my mind that I'll get lost or I don't make it there and I've never been like this before.
<b>DR:</b> So you stay preoccupied with things.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That may not be as -
<b>PT:</b> That shouldn't even bother me.
<b>DR:</b> Have you been taking your Klonopin I gave you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've been taking it.  I've been taking it and the pills that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] gave me, the pain pill.
<b>DR:</b> What's the name of it?
<b>PT:</b> Oh gosh, what's the name of those pills?
<b>DR:</b> How often do you take them?
<b>PT:</b> I take it every eight hours.
<b>DR:</b> Is it Ultram?
<b>PT:</b> No, no.
<b>DR:</b> Ultracet.
<b>PT:</b> No, no, I asked her for Ultracet but she didn't give me that one.  What was the name of that pill?  Because that nurse told me about Ultracet, it was real good for pain.  It's a big long white pill, I can't think of the name of that pill but she gave me, she said you should have your doctor have you tested for this.  She said because she was a nurse for like forty years and she said that a lot of people, the signs that I'm telling her, she said that's what they ended up having.  I said really, it's a strange name, it starts with an F.
<b>DR:</b> Fibromyalgia.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Everybody has fibromyalgia when they have aches and pains.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what she said.  She says it's constantly there.  I said I can be cooking standing up and I can feel the pain all going off in my body.  My mind just runs, it's different from when you sleep, sometimes the constipation, the pain in my stomach, I feel like throwing up but I wasn't like this and I never heard of that word, never heard of that word.  What is that?
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's like, you know, different muscles and the joints in your body hurt and it goes with the depression and some sleep problems, problems with concentration, forgetfulness but they have some trigger points in some of the areas of the body you're touching causes you to [INAUDIBLE] usually does a detailed examination and then they find the trigger points and that's how it's diagnosed.  It goes with the depression because patients are always in pain or the symptoms, some of the symptoms you are saying, yes, does fit that but you do have a strong family history so that even adds and you could have both, we don't know, time can only tell.  Treatment essentially doesn't make a difference, I mean, I still give patients Prozac and Desyrel or some kind of antidepressant and Trazodone or something to help you sleep at night or some sleep aids and see if that would make any difference but the thing of it is that you are on Prozac since how long you said?
<b>PT:</b> I think I -
