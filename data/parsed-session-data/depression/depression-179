BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Well, um, you mentioned that since taking Abilify you've had some nausea and I think -
<b>PT:</b> A little vomiting.
<b>DR:</b> Vomiting and -
<b>PT:</b> A little bit.
<b>DR:</b> I think that's probably more likely due to be from anxiety cause I think you have extreme anxiety going on.
<b>PT:</b> Well I tried, I only took a one mg Xanax, I didn't want to drive under the influence of it.  I try not to drive when I take it.  I just, I don't.  But I'm-
<b>DR:</b> How much of the Xanax are you taking now, we had 2 mg four times a day, you're not taking that much though.
<b>PT:</b> Three times a day you have it.
<b>DR:</b> At one point it was four, whatever [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> That was four.  And I only take chips and a one mg and a one mg here and it's always good to have.  I feel secure and safe.
<b>DR:</b> About how many total bars do you think you go through on an average day?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes a bar at night.  A chip in the morning, a one mg and -
<b>DR:</b> Like a couple a day thereabouts.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah but I, I, I, I feel secure in having that little extra in case I'm stuck in [DEIDENTIFIED] with nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I'm all for that.  I think you're -
<b>PT:</b> You know it's not that I'm using it, I just keep them there.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>PT:</b> You know?
<b>DR:</b> We'll keep you with some extra.  I think that you probably wanna bail yourself out of -
<b>PT:</b> I had a panic attack.  When I was in the store and I, with all my make-up and everything, this lady told me I don't look well and I said but I should look well. I was starting to sweat and I was getting nervous and we have to have, I wanna get off the Ambien.
<b>DR:</b> That's fine.  I think stress is probably what's showing.  You're obviously anxious.
<b>PT:</b> The Ambien didn't help me to sleep.  Neither did the Restoril.  And then I took three chlorohydrate.  Did you know I didn't even wait?
<b>DR:</b> Do not ever take more of that chlorohydrate [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> Well I didn't know, I took one capsule, waited three hours, took another one, and I waited two hours, took another one.  
<b>DR:</b> You get away with that with Ambien but not with chlorohydrate.  
<b>PT:</b> But I only fell asleep for an hour and a half.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> What's with that?  My body is immune to everything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well you're so wound up.  I think it's the anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> My body is so immune to it.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's not your body, it's your mind.  Your brain.
<b>PT:</b> Well maybe the Zoloft 100 mg was causing me to be a little manic cause they did say in hypomanic patients Zoloft can cause, um, they're not giving my son but 50 mg of Zoloft for when he gets a little manic.
<b>DR:</b> That could well be part of it.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I might start crying on 50 mg but I think maybe, um -
<b>DR:</b> You are going to start crying.
<b>PT:</b> I was okay on 50 but I mean I'll start crying over some stupid thing but 100 mg maybe makes me a little manic because every time in the morning they think I'm manic on the phone.  
<b>DR:</b> You're definitely wound and -
<b>PT:</b> Well I couldn't shop.  I couldn't, I felt so bad.  
<b>DR:</b> And you're not getting more than an hour or two of sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Tons of Visine and I actually couldn't try to sleep on my couch, it's hard to sleep.  And I wanna go through a withdrawal stuff.  I want you to tell me exactly what to do over a period of weeks so that in four weeks I don't, I'm not on any sleeping pills.
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> Mom's upset.  About my sleeping pills.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] there's probably not anything real tricky to that.
<b>PT:</b> How come Ambien CR doesn't do a thing?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think -
<b>PT:</b> Nothing.
<b>DR:</b> You might have hit the nail on the hand with that Zoloft being overstimulating and I think that's the bigger problem.  The sleeping pills aren't helping you sleep anyway so you're not in withdrawal cause the only withdrawal you have is not being able to sleep.  You're already not sleeping anyway so it can't get much worse, right?
<b>PT:</b> How many pills can I take, I mean I don't sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well I think maybe getting that Zoloft down, I mean we could try something different.  Vistaril sometimes works with that -
<b>PT:</b> No, I get allergies to that eventually.  Um, I'm having a little bit of fur on my head but I don't know if it's from the Abilify.  It's a little bit itchy.  
<b>DR:</b> You could see that with the 100 Zoloft too, though.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, 150 Zoloft.  
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> And 100 too, yeah.  Yeah, I think it got better with the 50 mg of Zoloft.  
<b>DR:</b> Another good reason to cut that down.
<b>PT:</b> I might cry a little bit more but 50 would be okay with me if I could figure out an answer to my life. I mean, I'm in a boxed unit with [AGE]-year-old people walking along a railing really slow.  It's like, I mean, I feel like I'm in a hospital nursing home and someone's at a prison.  Someone's at a hotel.  It's just really weird.  People come and go, they die in their apartments and then they just replace them, I mean it's just, I can't live like this, you know?  And my stomach is not feeling good and I had cereal, Rasin Bran, and a cup of coffee, I mean I normally don't have this problem.  And I didn't even swallow my vitamin.  But I took the Glucophage because my, my, my blood was a little high on the sugar.  But he didn't tell me to take the Glucophage so I was doing fine without the Glucophage, actually that stuff makes me nauseous too.  Oh maybe that was what made me nauseous, the Glucophage.  That stuff makes me upset.  What about the Abilify?  Do I really need an antipsychotic?   I mean, I mean, I hate to tell you this but I don't hear voices.  I'm not psychotic.
<b>DR:</b> No, I realize that.
<b>PT:</b> And I was a chatterbox at the age of [AGE] I can talk a hundred subjects at one time and nothing, Geodon didn't help me.  Zyprexa made me go to sleep at night, feel good.  Everybody thought I seemed better.  Thought, it went, I went up to 246 pounds, 258. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Unfortunately, that's the drawback of that drug.  And it's my favorite drug.
<b>DR:</b> Unfortunately in deed, cause it did seem to work for you.  Um, if you read up on that a little further, granted the first use is for, Abilify, Zyprexa and drugs of that nature, Geodon, were antipsychotic and you're not psychotic, I agree with that.  Um, but they are not used as much for mood stabilizers as they are for psychosis.  And Abilify, another good thought with the Zoloft, um, Abilify in some recent studies has shown to have a FDA approval for treatment in bipolar depression and have anti-depressant effects but not the sort like Zoloft which could flip you into mania.
<b>PT:</b> My son said he feels flat.  
<b>DR:</b> It's an anti-manic drug.
<b>PT:</b> He feels flat.  Like he's an artist.  He can't do his artwork.  He's doing computer circuit boards.  He's working though eleven to five Monday through Friday.
<b>DR:</b> Something can be said for that.  It's probably -
<b>PT:</b> He is holding on to his job.
<b>DR:</b> It's hard enough trying to figure you out, I can't figure him out.
<b>PT:</b> And he's on 15 mg Abilify and he says Mom, do you always have to talk?  We talk for an hour from ten-thirty to eleven-thirty at night, his time, seven-thirty.  And he was getting tired after so he didn't answer my phone call last night.  He says, I said, yeah, it's my outlet talking, I mean sometimes I get discounts talking, I find out where the cheapest place to get this is.  I get help with this.  Actually my mouth gets me in trouble two out of three times but I actually get a lot of benefits being able to ask people things. I found out where the dental clinic is in [DEIDENTIFIED], by telling a girl, I called seven dentists and I found out I couldn't get my $6,140 worth of work done on my teeth so I, I was a dental assistant in [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] and a dental hygienist in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I said, so I talked to this girl, I said I've never been this poor in my life and she said um, there's a clinic in [DEIDENTIFIED] and to call the first week, so I called them and they said to call the first day, the first week in April and they'll get me in $15 a filling, $15 an exam.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> $350 for the crowns so I need like about 10 crowns.  I mean, I need money.  I mean, I need to meet somebody.  I also can't [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said I need a sex life, and I said oh, are you asking me out, and I didn't notice he had a ring on his left hand.  I swear I never noticed that gold ring before.  He says he wants the girls to call me when there's salsa Latin dancing at [DEIDENTIFIED] on a Friday night.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Well if I wanna meet a Latin guy, the last time I met two Latin guys, they were both married and they didn't say they were married and they had kids.  And I didn't know the difference cause their English wasn't that great.  I don't think I wanna get in any kind of, you know, I wanna meet a normal every day guy with a good job.  I mean, a good profession.  And, um -
<b>DR:</b> It might make your life a little more complicated at the time when you don't need it right now.
<b>PT:</b> Well I went to three years of college.  I mean, I only have a year left for a degree.  Um, I just can't seem to pass the math.  The math is holding me up and I mean, you know, it's not that I'm not educated.  It's not that.  I'm actually too educated in some areas.  I mean, I could work at a pharmacy and spell every single drug there is, you know?  I'm gonna give you the chlorohydrate, I was gonna throw it in the trash cause you told me to flush it down the toilet but I'm gonna give it to you because if somebody wants one or two, you could just like dispense one or two.  
<b>DR:</b> Okay, but do not ever take more than [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> I'm not giving you it back, I don't trust myself.
<b>DR:</b> It is not a safe drug to take excessive amounts of, uh Anna Nicole Smith -
<b>PT:</b> Anna Nicole, yeah, I'm giving you that back, and I'm giving you, well, the Zyprexa and I mean, I have all that Geodon and I have all that, I have all those samples you gave me too and stuff so I'm gonna, I don't know.  I don't think that after all those years on Geodon, more than six years, seven years, it didn't help me.  
<b>DR:</b> Well, I think we need to give the Abilify a chance and like you said, I think you might have come up with something or other that the Zoloft may be overstimulating you and particularly since we know Abilify has anti-depressant effects any way, you probably won't have that crying.  
<b>PT:</b> Well my son's suicidal eleven times and I'm not.  Why am I taking the same thing?
<b>DR:</b> Well, we could go into a bunch of [INAUDIBLE] I can't diagnose him - 
<b>PT:</b> I'm only a little depressed about my situation.  That I'm in a nursing home situation which my daughter put me in, she's had no idea that [DEIDENTIFIED] is in the middle of nowhere, and my sons moved me here and I need $1200 to move out and get a place and I need the U-Haul and I need everything and I just, I just don't wanna be here.
<b>DR:</b> And I think you got some fairly good reasons for all of that -
<b>PT:</b> If I go back to [DEIDENTIFIED], I'll go to [DEIDENTIFIED] office, and see the female girl there and we'll just work from the stuff, whatever you got me going on.
<b>DR:</b> Right, but what we need to do, regardless of [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> The next couple months we gotta get this straightened out, I mean -
<b>DR:</b> You need to focus on it, exactly.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, how about trying to give me a withdrawal pattern on, not that I get totally sick going off the, all the sleeping pills.
<b>DR:</b> I'd be as inclined right now -
<b>PT:</b> He even said are you gonna go cold turkey, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said, I said yeah, he goes, I don't know, I better check with [PHYSICIAN NAME].
<b>DR:</b> Well, I wouldn't go cold turkey on the Xanax.  That could be [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> Not that, not that.  I wanna know about that later but not, not now.  Now I wanna know about these sleeping pills.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they're not working anyway so the only problem you have is not being able to sleep so it wouldn't be any worse than it already is.  But I think right now -
<b>PT:</b> I brought it back, it put me sleep, it may help, eventually, if I don't sleep for three days?
<b>DR:</b> No, maybe, but, then again we gotta slow things down to where you're not [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> So Restoril I gotta pay for.  You know, fourteen dollars or something and I only have to pay six dollars and something for the Ambien.  
<b>DR:</b> Hmm, that's odd.
<b>PT:</b> Six ten.
<b>DR:</b> Normally they cost two or three tomes more 
<b>PT:</b> It used to be a hundred and some dollars and they wouldn't cover it a whole year and I didn't know what to do when I was on Ambien for like 20 years, but since it doesn't help me.
<b>DR:</b> Right, there's no point adding new drugs if it doesn't help 
<b>PT:</b> What's the point?
<b>DR:</b> What has worked -
<b>PT:</b> He's taking me off of Fosamax.  He's taking me off, he says you have osteoporosis and I said I have what?  And then he read it again.  I have three pages to bring you.  I have blood work.  And he says I'm getting new blood work done, fasting blood work.  I'll go to the hospital on Friday morning or something.  And um, he said, um, you have osteopenia of the lumbar area, so, and I have a high fracture risk.  Almost 31 years in [DEIDENTIFIED] killed me.  How did I know that was gonna kill my back carrying a 36-pound table and working on all those six-foot-eight people, all those golfers and those basketball players and computer operators, and I mean I got $125 an hour plus tips.  I mean, I am good.  I know what I'm doing.  I mean I am really good and I'm not gonna settle for these, these girls over here I went to check out their, downstairs, ninety dollars for a massage and it's not even nearly as good as what I give.  You know?  And I miss that occupation.
<b>DR:</b> I think if we got a little bit of Zyprexa for a few days to allow that Zoloft to stabilize, that might be the trick -
<b>PT:</b> The Abilify?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, with the Abilify.  But go ahead and use the Zyprexa like a sleeping pill.  We could go ahead and check your blood sugar right now make sure that is not being, not elevated, that can be a long term side effect of Zyprexa but I'm not thinking long term, I'm thinking in terms of a week.
<b>PT:</b> I ended up with diabetes.  After Zyprexa a couple years.
<b>DR:</b> Couple years, right.  I'm thinking in terms of a week.  Allow that Zoloft -
<b>PT:</b> He sent me a lawsuit on that, you know?  I filed for it, I mean it's better than nothing.  Maybe I'll get some money out of it.  
<b>DR:</b> You take anything for diabetes now?
<b>PT:</b> No, I have Glucophage at home.
<b>DR:</b> Glucophage, yeah -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I'm not taking it.  I wasn't taking it and he read my sugar 108.  But I've been checking my sugar and I got 123 today using sugar, so um, that's not too bad.  I mean, it used to be 80-120 but down at the cancer center they go all berserk.  Oh, [PATIENT NAME], you're diabetic, diabetic, you're over 120.  I said oh, you know, big whoopee doo, but my uncle is diabetic, is [AGE], my father's age when he passed away, and his other brother died at [AGE] with complications of diabetes, had his leg cut off, his foot cut off, up to the knee and then he died.  I mean, you know, because he didn't believe in doctors and he did not take the medication.  So I'm gonna take a fasting blood sugar too.  Um, of course I ate that little cherry pie -
<b>DR:</b> Let's check it now and see where -
<b>PT:</b> I ate that little cherry pie last night from Wal-Mart.
<b>DR:</b> That's a non-fasting, might be a little bit higher than the absolute norm, but you know, if it's not up there around 150, 180, I wouldn't sweat it too much.
<b>PT:</b> I had, well I ate a whole bag of chocolate covered peanuts.  I had 257 at the cancer center.  And they, well they got upset.  
<b>DR:</b> You're diabetic, you shouldn't be eating chocolate covered peanuts, so -
<b>PT:</b> They got upset.  But I haven't, I haven't been doing any sugar.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  
<b>PT:</b> I don't even use sugar.  
<b>DR:</b> All righty.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I got a testing thing and I have strips and I do it.  
<b>DR:</b> Good, well you can keep an eye on it over the next few days also, but I think, you know, it's a long term effect, something like a week would have virtually no effects.
<b>PT:</b> Well, [NAME OTHER] or whatever her name was, [NAME OTHER] whatever her name is that assists [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], she said um, she said, why don't we do, she says 5 mg Zyprexa and then she says how about 10 mg of Zyprexa.  I said I gain weight and I get diabetes so she says well why don't we do a happy medium, 7.5.  So I got to 7.5.  But they did classify me as diabetic.  
<b>DR:</b> Well you have to have a glucose challenge fasting and all that good stuff.
<b>PT:</b> I did.  It came out 6.4 and normal is 1.5-5.3 and I had 6.4.
<b>DR:</b> See where we stand today.
<b>PT:</b> That's over a period of six months.  That's over a period of six months.  You are not on the list of Zyprexa.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] for three or four years on Zyprexa.  That's when they diagnosed me.  
<b>DR:</b> 90.
<b>PT:</b> Hmm.
<b>DR:</b> So I don't think they need to worry about it long term
<b>PT:</b> I think I took one of those pills. No I didn't.  I couldn't swallow it today, I was nauseous.  I didn't swallow it.
<b>DR:</b> I think we're okay with that.  Let's um -
<b>PT:</b> I do sugar free everything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, very good, it sounds like maintain -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm okay.  
<b>DR:</b> The diet and [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> I did have some bread today and milk.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Well let's get the Zyprexa going for let's say a week and get you some sleep.  Get that Zoloft down -
<b>PT:</b> Take 7.5 Zyprexa for how long?
<b>DR:</b> Um, well when are we scheduled for checkup?
<b>PT:</b> I wish you'd see me earlier than when I'm scheduled because -
<b>DR:</b> Okay, let's shoot for next week then, and we will just keeping taking the Zyprexa pill then.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because you got me all the way down where I'm, I waited six months to get a PAP smear with the GYN in town on [DATE] and then you're on [DATE] and [DATE] is [DEIDENTIFIED] and that's the last time I'm going to [DEIDENTIFIED].  The big chicken for the guys that fix my car, and then my car doesn't start seven times around, you know?  I mean I'm having a real problem, they wanna get me a used car.  120,000 miles Honda Accord.  Why would I want that when I put every new part in my car and it's 124,000 miles?  And it's twenty years old, but it's, he says gee, this is a nineteen ninety-four and the air conditioning blows out real cold, you'll really love it and I'm getting it in the month and I thought I don't know.  I don't know.  Look at it I burned my hand -
<b>DR:</b> Well we will worry about today's problems today.
<b>PT:</b> On a toaster oven, trying to get a diet pizza out, healthy sized pizza with a fork and not moving the blender.  And I don't know what this is.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have, do you still have some Zyprexa at home you said, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And you gave me some samples of 2.5 so I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Fives, so let's go with 7.5 at night just using that for sleep.  Try taking the Xanax three times a day or divide it out for you know, but you know, three pills a day, 6 mg.  Get that anxiety under control.  Little Zyprexa on board, some sleep, everything kind of calmed down the Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b> I take a 1 mg in the morning and one at night?
<b>DR:</b> No, you can take chips as long as you get, you know, take three pills a day where you can divide them up, chip here chip there whatever, I don't care.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah?
<b>DR:</b> Whatever seems best for you.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But for now let's go to three a day, get the anxiety under control.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I don't know what to do.  I can't live with my mother, she's got all her stuff and she's, guess what she was doing this morning at nine o'clock?  On a ladder washing windows.  
<b>DR:</b> One day at a time.
<b>PT:</b> At [AGE] years old.
<b>DR:</b> One day at a time.
<b>PT:</b> She's painting, Van Gough paintings.  She's working in her garden growing tomatoes and gardenias.  She is a totally super woman.  She wouldn't stand the fact that I'm being lazy here.  You know, I mean I'm going through my pictures with the kids and putting them in boxes with names on it and after the box goes an albums and then they get the albums of them growing up with me.  That's why I have no money, cause I spent it all on the kids.  
<b>DR:</b> Okay, here we go.
<b>PT:</b> I had money but, you know -
<b>DR:</b> Xanax -
<b>PT:</b> I also lost money in the stock market.  Seventeen thousand.  I only got sixteen thousand from the divorce and then he foreclosed on me on the house, I was making three hundred twenty-five a month mortgage payments, I could have kept that house in [DEIDENTIFIED], five bedrooms, four baths, with a quarter acre yard, eight foot ribbon fence and a pool and I lost, I signed my name off of everything, you know why?  The doctor down in [DEIDENTIFIED] gave me Thorazine, Mellaril, I couldn't lift the baby's diaper.  So my husband had to hire a housekeeper because he didn't think I could live to take care of the baby.  
<b>DR:</b> Hindsight is twenty twenty.  Here we have Xanax three a day.  May divide any way you feel fit, Zoloft 50 mg, Abilify 15, we continue that, and then Zyprexa 7.5.  This will help with sleep. Getting that -
<b>PT:</b> Now I can see occasionally my Mom said something, like in a blue, I didn't in a blue moon, she says occasionally I can see if you really can't sleep you take a sleeping pill but the way I've been taking them, none of them work.
<b>DR:</b> They're not working, that's the main thing, so let's check back next week and I think that you'll see that anxiety start to come down, the Zyprexa getting in your system -
<b>PT:</b> And I don't know about you seeing you on the [DATE], can we do something else with that appointment?
<b>DR:</b> You will have to check [NAME OTHER] on that, she'll fill you in sometime next week.
<b>PT:</b> Next week?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  We'll decide from there where we go.
<b>PT:</b> I gotta mail the communion gift and do the memo.  I gotta check with you when?
<b>DR:</b> Sounds like a plan then.
