BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: May 4th, Second Interview.
COUNSELOR: ...you know why I didn't but...I know Murphy very slightly.
CLIENT: Oh!
COUNSELOR: And I've seen you together at meetings and stuff and...
CLIENT: Probably, yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...like I don't know where I know him from because I went to the college...
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...in Sperryville.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: But I mean I also want to know, it seemed to make a difference to me and I really can't figure out why, but I wondered whether it made a difference to you or whether...
CLIENT: No, not really.
COUNSELOR: I mean it doesn't make a difference in how I think about you or...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...anything but I guess, I can't really say what it is but it seems slightly like it could be odd more than anything else.
CLIENT: What do you mean by it could be odd?
COUNSELOR: You know that it could make you uncomfortable.
CLIENT: I don't think so. I don't think so unless you were with somebody who violently dislikes me (ph)...like...
COUNSELOR: No, I really do, I think I [heard it on] (ph)...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...unless we've...No, it doesn't make much difference to me then.
CLIENT: I overslept this morning and I missed my first class so that's new for the trend, because I don't know how I'm going to make up the notes from it, and the other people or with other friends, two, five graduate students, all male who I've allegedly hang around with, so (big sigh) I'm going to have to hassle with that. It's been a hideous week and it's just been an awful week. And...usually when I got, if at all, (chuckling) it was together with him...we'd get out. We had a really bad fight on Friday night and kind of over, kind of managed to make himself a film and it was Sunday morning, Saturday morning, too. I mean and very strange for me to recognize just, but he was being upset and I was just being blah, was chilled to reacting, was just sitting there and... [overlapping voices at 0:02:17.7]
COUNSELOR: You didn't want to react or you really weren't?
CLIENT: I didn't want to react and I really didn't feel that even, I mean at the time I was just so tired and I was, I was just so tired of hassling and just...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...simply tired because I had finished work and it was, it was three or four in the morning, and fantastically hassled about all the things I had to do. I was, I haven't - I've done an absolute minimum of the things I was going to accomplish this weekend as far as getting schoolwork done. I mean one article, as a matter of fact that's all, one article; out of the maybe 150 pages that I have to do I've read 25 pages, I just didn't have the time, I just, it just never materialized. Ah, and all those things happened and it just never got done and I feel grievously guilty about it and I don't know what in the hell I'm going to do, because I know that I don't have any time until maybe Friday where I could see possibly doing the last two weeks work over this coming weekend but I still have this week's work but, and it just never stops. And then, so... [0:03:39.5]
COUNSELOR: So is it really like just feeling like you can never get completed on that, on getting caught up...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...with this?
CLIENT: Right and I just never finish work; work is really hideous, I really hate it, I want to quit so much but I can't, I need the bread I mean. He walked in last night and I was tired, it was my second shift that I'd worked three hours in the afternoon and then gone to billings to pick my check up and schlepped back and walked in, there was no busboy and I had to go do busboy work and I just thought, "Nah (ph)." I was just so blue (ph).
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know it was (big sigh) - but Murphy...I felt very badly. I feel very badly because like yesterday he got, we were hoping that possibly he would - I think it's been for the last about, from December until about the end of March he was working as an independent researcher for a place that's doing a project on underground films with him and then they weren't sure whether they wanted to continue the project or not, and it pays considerably, I mean it really was a good job. So we've been waiting to hear anything about it and like he finally got the word yesterday they're not going to continue the project, through no fault of his, and that it, he was hoping possibly they might have a staff opening where...for a writer and that looks very improbable, too. So he's really down and he's really worried about what to do for a job and where to go next. And at this point I just can't help him. I mean usually I can kind of rally up some sort of moral support. "You know well I don't exactly know what to do but it seems to me you should do something along these lines." And he always fills in the details with this...he just needs encouragement, and I can't even do that.
COUNSELOR: You kind of don't have that in you, you know?
CLIENT: I just don't have the energy right now, I'm just so down about everything. Um, and I feel, and I feel guilty about that very much because here I should be helping him, I should be giving him some sort of support but I can't and it's very obvious to him and it's very obvious to him that I'm the one who needs the support right now, but at the same time he's very, he's very down too and very confused.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And every time I'm presented with a problem I get upset and then have to say, "Well I don't know...I just don't know any more than you do and I really can't say anything." Which makes him feel bad, it becomes very, it's a very vicious circle. Like right now he needs a haircut and that's just a drag because he's got really strange hair and if he's out looking for a job he should get a decent haircut. Well we know of places in Chicago but we don't know of any places in D.C.. If he walks into a barber he'll be butchered and if we just had...one of our friends do it he would be butchered and...the idea is kind of a hard sell, you want to present yourself as sort of together, intelligent, young man whenever you're tromping around in the middle of a recession looking for a job. So we've both really on edge about that, which is stupid... [0:06:54.8]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...but we are, because we just don't know where to go and we don't have the type of friends who, who go to...hairstylists or whatever that would know if they're decent or not. (big sigh)
COUNSELOR: So it's like a really concrete problem that's confronting you and being at a complete loss...
CLIENT: Oh, yeah it's...
COUNSELOR: ...but...
CLIENT: ...just, yeah, completely concrete, it's and it's how to go about getting a job, I mean what job do you want and where do you look for it? And I've usually been very together about it and on this I just am not and I'm just no help at all.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. And you kind of, I guess you kind of mean that, that you can't, it's not that you can't think of ideas but you really don't want to or you can't even get it together to do that...
CLIENT: Really.
COUNSELOR: ...and to kind of put out for another person, is that what you mean for him and that's what you need to say, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. I just can't, like I just can't produce outwards [because I'm lonely.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: It's like, is that like not really feeling any of that set energy that you want, wanted to give anything to him?
CLIENT: Yeah. Well I want to, I mean...
COUNSELOR: You wish you could.
CLIENT: I wish I could but I just don't seem to be able to muster it together, so. I got a loan from a strange and like Jewish Agency for next year for $500.00 which is great, which means I can take a summer course without taking out a state loan or something like that. And I got - and I talked to my parents on Thursday night, and usually...I, I try and put things across really nicely for them and I'm more cheery and I put the bright light on things and stuff like and I just didn't bother, and I was just purely - they called as I was in the middle of cooking a really big dinner, which was really good and a lot of fun with my friends, (big sigh) but I just didn't want to hassle with it and they kept on asking, asking a lot of questions and I just didn't put, I just said exactly what was in my head and that was it; I sounded dreadful and I know it, I was sounding exhausted and disenchanted and just hardened. And I deliberately didn't cover any of that up because I decided it was about time they realized what was happening. And...I, when I got the check, which they had received and then sent to me, I got this little letter from my mother saying...how appalled that everything in my life sounded so bad and what I needed was a few weeks at the seashore. That, that's all..."shouldn't you take a vacation", she's been saying that for whole quarter now, "Shouldn't you take a vacation" to "I don't understand why you're taking these again, a summer course, and what you need obviously is just to take off a few weeks and stay at the seashore and lull (ph) in the sun". [0:09:53.4]
COUNSELOR: So when she prescribes for you and prescribes that what happens to you, what do you really want to say to her?
CLIENT: What I really want to say is, "Well if you'll pay for it sure, otherwise how the hell am I supposed to get out there?"
COUNSELOR: You mean otherwise, "What the hell do you think you're doing saying something like that"?
CLIENT: Yeah. Something like that would cost on the, on the order, and this is minimum of 100 a week, by the time you finish repaying for a place down...someplace at the shore and food and entertainment, and I think well I still have to pay all the expenses I have here because I have an apartment and shit like that, I can't just take off, and I'll be losing money instead of making it because I won't be working...it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, why don't I take a few weeks and go to the seashore, oh, my God. Sure, why don't I, I'd love to...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and it's really absurd.
COUNSELOR: And so it's something that it betrays such a complete lack of understanding...
CLIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: ...of what your situation is?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean also if I were to say that...or I could say, "Well would you give me the money?" All I'd get is something like, "Oh, I'm sure you could scrape it up somewhere and I'm certain that you really need to do that."
COUNSELOR: Wow, because what, because that too is completely misunderstanding where they've put you?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, totally. They're expecting me to sponge off Murphy and the money he's made and the money we've put away from his salary, which I feel very strangely about. "Well you've got $1,000.00 in a savings account, you could just go anywhere." Yeah, but for a few months we may have to eat off that $1,000.00...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and I'd rather have it there. So I don't know, I just feel very down and just like...I don't feel good (ph). (big sigh) Now I've figured out one topic for a class I have to do and it's pretty interesting and then so I have to get it approved or it's worthless, so what the hell. As far as the other one is concerned I don't know what the hell I'm going to do and I'm just kind of lost.
COUNSELOR: Well so that's one more thing where you just can't organize yourself?
CLIENT: Yeah, it is to be able to think. Well one of the papers, I think the other one is just I'm just really frightened about the whole assignment. I don't know, I don't even know is if I have someone I could like go talk to about it, I can't talk to him about it, he's not much help but I have a few friends, one of these grad students takes the course and so we all said I was close to the group and that he, he can give me an idea of what he's working on...
COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.
CLIENT: ...something like that.
COUNSELOR: But those things are kind of concrete solutions but do they really make you feel any better? [0:12:49.1]
CLIENT: No, (chuckling) not at all because they're, they're just...somehow or other I have to find the time to do that and then somehow or other I have to find the 20 hours a week or whatever is necessary to put together a really topnotch research paper. Also, it's the type of paper where you have to review all of the work done in the area, criticize and make your own suggestions, and I'm just not to the point where I can do really intelligent criticism or, and/or making my own suggestions, and I'm just not up to that yet. The course is way above my head. (yawning)
COUNSELOR: Yeah, so you aren't going to be - so it's like thinking that you aren't going to be able to do it?
CLIENT: Yeah, because this has made it harder to start, so. (big sigh)
COUNSELOR: Like kind of that you're just going to be opting to get into a situation where you're going to feel overwhelmed again?
CLIENT: Yeah. I'm just...within two weeks I'll, I'll be just totally lost and just treading through the material and not getting anything out of...and not getting anything out of reading, which is a big facet when you get into very technical material. I guess until you adjust to the style it's very difficult to pull out what they say is what the objectives are. I have to get, to get myself to finish 90 percent of the thing is relatively - oh. What might happen is...I'm going over to billings this afternoon because I have a colitis condition, which I've had for a really long time, and if I can talk them into it I would really like to go through their cure for colitis, which is a marked hospitalization, I mean which is really something for it's just a very bland diet and then just like major amounts of rest, maybe that would be the answer, that would be a stop (chuckling) and I could have a real stand still there even though it wouldn't be until this summer and I wouldn't take the course.
COUNSELOR: But I, but you mean that it's not, not the curing of colitis that you'd really be doing it, but for just calling a truce and then a really enforced one, where you would...
CLIENT: Jail (ph).
COUNSELOR: ...like and another way to put that is that like now you can't seem to make that kind of room for yourself, so that kind of room for resting, for thinking of whatever...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...sort of the things that are good about it are, and it doesn't seem like you can do it except by complete...
CLIENT: Yeah, just stopping everything.
COUNSELOR: ...giving, giving your all to that?
CLIENT: Yeah, stopping with everything. [It would be nice to leave the colitis, still like I've had it since fifth grade...to a degree.] (ph) (big sigh) [0:15:47.7]
COUNSELOR: Yeah, that and you're not saying...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...that that's irrelevant?
CLIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Um...
CLIENT: And the summer looks like it's going to be exactly the same as now, no change going that I can see.
COUNSELOR: You can't see any ways that you could possibly make it any different, I mean in terms of structuring your time?
CLIENT: Yeah, because what will happen is I want to pick up a course in stats (ph), a course that's required...I think there's usually four of them, psychology majors, and get it out of the way because someway or other in my program I'd like to squeeze in chemistry and calculus because I'm mainly very interested in experimental science things and bio science and I really think chemistry would be very helpful. And then my program's kind of screwed up on my apps. (ph) though with biology.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: (big sigh) So if I can get this stat out of the way that's one less thing I have to worry about, because the idea of taking three or four, well (making noise) sequence courses again would drive me crazy; I did that last year and I'd never do it again.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So I need lots of room...you have, in my program to, to allow myself to have enough freedom to set up the program in such a way that I can function in it without really getting...just disgusted and dropping everything. (yawning) And, uh, what I'll probably do is pick up more time at the restaurant because it's summertime and I should make more money, and that's it, I'm finished, so right there.
COUNSELOR: Right, m-hmm. Well you say, "what I'll do is I'll, I'll probably pick up more time because it's summertime and I should make more money", like there's this inevitable link there.
CLIENT: Yeah, except I don't, I don't know how much more time I can pick up. Well last summer I worked on a major schedule, that's because I was new and didn't know what I was doing, and everybody was, has a job [when it starts up, just feed them.] (ph) But it would be nice if I had only one class; that would definitely...something like math where I could just do 20 minutes of homework for a class and just ride. If I had more time I would just kind of, I would hope to do more reading...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and there's a... [inaudible at 0:18:19.9] ...class I would like to take and that's a really [good one.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But depending on what the money situation is, if I, if I didn't have to I wouldn't pick up more time but I have a feeling that I will.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. So, so now this is, it's not like it's because it's summer and you have to do more?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: But you may have to because of what...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...your summer's going to be like? [0:18:40.7]
CLIENT: I like doing things. I mean it's just going to be another hassle (chuckling) with the courses and next year I think is going to be even worse than this year and simply because as the courses get more and more demanding and I'm thinking of going into the honors program and I'd like to do some work in Freeman lab, but, uh, I just don't see where the time comes from. And I resent the job fantastically. You know nobody else I know is, is, is trying to do this shit and trying to do as much, get as much out of that.
COUNSELOR: So you think this is not right?
CLIENT: People I know who are...working hard on their academics, so they're working hard on their academics I would think and finding out what they want to do, but I know what I want to do and I know what I want to go into and I want to concentrate on these things but I can't! The course that's most important to me now is the one that's being neglected the most, has the demand for most time, and I can't fit it into half an hour sections which I have open. I really feel unfairly treated...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...kind of...everybody else...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and then me, and that it's really hurting me though. My father asks stupid questions like, "How are you doing in school?" "How do you think I'm doing in school, I'm hopelessly behind."
COUNSELOR: And it's your fault?
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) Yeah. What will I do he wants to know, "if you're behind?" I said, "I'll manage somehow."
COUNSELOR: You mean time they're using and you're just trying to keep the panic from, from...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...getting to you and there he is... [overlapping voices at 0:20:30.0]
CLIENT: And then he wants reassurance that his little girl is going to bring home good marks so he can be proud, yeah, I get that a lot, oh man, Jesus. (big sigh) And I thought that it's just the whole time hassle, I really feel dizzy about Murphy. I mean like (sighing) sometimes his demands are ridiculous but I understand that...he needed, that he as much as I needs reassurance and at least to be with me, and that's the great thing about it, he is there and he's very fond and when I need help he's right there and I, when I need support there's just never any doubt that I'll get it. And then I feel very guilty about my contribution to him now because I just, I'm just not doing it and then...occasionally I get very resentful when he asks me for things. Right now he's just working on his script and seeing a lot of movies, because when he wants to he'll have a lot of good things around but he has the time to pick and go and I don't, not going to see the same films, and I want to go to the same concerts that he's going to...and all the things that he does that I don't have the time to do. [0:21:42.5]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm, and there's a kind of bitterness and envy in that?
CLIENT: Yeah, there really is.
COUNSELOR: That's interesting.
CLIENT: Yeah, I have to, I mean I feel like I'm trying to, to hold three jobs at once, the restaurant, school and him, and he's just not working (ph). And I feel the person whose, I finally guess what happens is the restaurant is just this set amount of time and I just have to be there so I am. Schoolwork (big sigh) is something that's got to be done within a certain limit, so like sometimes it...I tend to make more time for it. Whereas the way I look at it is he's always going to be here (chuckling), you know so he's the one who gets slighted.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm, but that, that solution doesn't really sit well, right?
CLIENT: No, not at all, because right now he needs help, too, [I sort of think but,] (ph) and like I don't see any solution from him. I mean possibly I need to drop the hostessing I'm doing and that leaves me one more day for, I would be at home. I'm to the point where I feel hamstrung or I'm not using it to...what little time I do have I'm just not using either because I'm just so un-together.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, the other stuff, like saying the other stuff has gotten so frantic that...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...you're just like this way?
CLIENT: [Maybe I could...just start accomplishing things.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: But do you mean that when you think about ordering the time you have that you just panic and can't think that through?
CLIENT: (big sigh) No, it's not even like that. It's usually I don't have the time when I start doing it and I get discouraged over that.
COUNSELOR: Over?
CLIENT: Over the amount that's left, the speed at which I'm doing it all.
COUNSELOR: Kind of like thinking all the time you're doing it it's not enough...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...this just isn't enough?
CLIENT: Right and I just stop, I just can't do it anymore or I lose the thread of what I'm reading, because there's no point in reading if I don't understand it and I throw it down and try and, kind of try and do something else or just kind of sit around read a newspaper or something or just, or go to sleep a lot of the time. Well usually what happens is I can't do my school for the tons of things that have to be done, you know?
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Like the only day that I really have set aside a large amount of time, it wasn't Thursday it was Sunday. What happened was I was in the reserved room and realized I could check the books out from writer's (ph) class, one of the writer's classes offer them, came home, read 25 pages, and by the time I got that all done it was time to make supper...so that when I get discouraged in the middle of something, if I'm not doing my schoolwork I can...clean the house or take care of the, do something for the cats and change the kitty litter and make supper, do the dishes, sew that button on and stuff, washout underwear for tomorrow...20 million things, I've got to get this, which I have to get or pick up that or return this, and...those things you have said or just not to be at school because there's so many other little things that need doing or be... [0:25:13.3]
COUNSELOR: You can distract yourself from, from that feeling of incompleteness...
CLIENT: Ah.
COUNSELOR: ...if that's the kind of dynamic that you're describing?
CLIENT: (big sigh) Ah, no, well, no it's not even that, it's kind of, I'm still very much aware that I haven't done it but I figure I'll get these things out of the way and then later I'll have more time to. But by the time I get these things done it's time to go to work and by the time I come back from work I'm exhausted and I fall asleep and I don't get to reading done.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, there's, I've left a big space in the middle of my day on Tuesdays and Thursdays on campus like to read when there's really tons of stuff that I have to, and, uh, I tend to get discouraged in the middle and it's just, I just look at it and I just say, "Oh Christ, I'm never going to get this done, why the hell am I doing it?" I pick up and I dump (ph) my classes for the next weekend or I kind of wonder around aimlessly and get very depressed because I don't run into anybody I know or anybody to talk with. So I probably make it half or, or what will happen is go into the bookstore and pick up a piece of fiction and just sit and read, and that's fine, I mean if I...pick up something which, which just sparks my interest and it's great, it's a real relief to be reading and comprehending, but, uh, I can't do that for much longer [at least maybe in the interim.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: And I guess the problem with the reserve room reading is that he keeps giving you the message that you're stupid, that you don't understand?
CLIENT: Yeah. Now it's very abstract theory in many cases on about how you extremely (ph) feel, some of the reasons for this being interesting is going from the [textbook and finally hear his average, which pleases me a lot.] (ph) On the paper that I'd like to do, I think once I get started on it it's going to be damn good and very interesting. (big sigh) And I'm doing it for a course on acquisition of values and it's just a free paper...you do something vaguely related to values. And what I'd like to do is research the collation between values of the time and the values set forth in this literature, and I find the question is, is art for art's sake or does it have some social reflection, which is the kind of question that interests me. And what I'm going to do is take various studies that have been done in the '50s, see, set up kind of a value scale and see what was prevalent just in that time. And then I'm going to go back to old New York Times book reviews in the '50s and see if I can compile a list of perhaps five or six books which were popular say in 1951 and see if I can get the lead through that, take what, what values these books were espousing and see what I come up with. Possibly, if I have enough time, I may do something similar for 1969 and see if there's any change of values reflected in the literature. But, uh, I don't know, I think it will be a nice project and I think it will be interesting. If I can get...get solidly started in it I'll feel better about that course right away. [0:28:57.3]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Not like, like most this course for me really bugs me and I don't know what I'm going to do. And Western Civ. is a laugh. Western Civ. is just a lot of, it isn't even that much reading but I haven't been able to do it, so.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, so there is more likely, there is a manageable task and you still have... [overlapping voices at 0:29:23.0]
CLIENT: And I still haven't done it, and it's just amazing how little time there is left. Well then...there are things I want to do, like I cut out a dress three weeks ago that I'd love to make and I just bought material for curtains for two windows, one drapes for the front room, which is going to take a long time to make, and then a set of curtains for the study and I imagine that's going to take me at least three or four hours to make that, I mean by the time I put the rods up and measure carefully; I'll have to come to campus to the UT Custom Import, they've got a really big table with measurements so I can just lay everything out and match it...make sure I've got the right measurements and everything straight and that's three or four hours for a simple set of curtains and at least two or three days for the set of drapes I'm doing in the living room, because I'm going to have to cut things, then I'm going to have to match the design to make panels and...and by the time I finished with the hand hemming and then I, the curtains I've really planned to pleater tape but the living room ones I want to do by hand, pleat them by hand, and that's going to take forever and ever. So I don't even know what I'm going to do now, I mean I'm really trying not to think about it, but then I've picked out material for the bedroom and I want to go downtown and get it before it disappears and that will be lying around too for something I'm going to do.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I want to paint the back porch because it's...[the key imposed worry.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And, uh, it would really be nice until we can afford curtains in the dining room too, to have that porch painted really brightly, it would be really nice. So there's some point or other at which I'd like to do that. And I promised, and I promised Murphy in January that he could take a series of pictures of that (ph) and I would like to have that done, just actually do some pictures of Chicago now and I'd like to get some pictures of the cats before they stop being kittens. So there's that and we'd like to go away to Greene for a weekend because we haven't been out of the city since Christmas.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. So you look at all this stuff and it's just like this incredible amount?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Like it, and like what happens if you look at it and what does it say to you?
CLIENT: Well it, it makes you really depressed, basically because the school never finishes, but I'd love to sit down and do the curtains because (chuckling) when you finish they're up there and they're just a fantastic ego boost, they make a difference. [0:32:04.6]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. You'd like to know you can do something...
CLIENT: Yeah, right...
COUNSELOR: ...at this point? And it's like...
CLIENT: ...something finite...and this, this would be perfect because, I mean...I've finally found the time to put the one lousy, little curtain up in the kitchen and change the room entirely, it's just such a more cheery room...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...you know and just brightening up the surroundings and it's a nice apartment now, and it may need a little more work then it would be fine, I mean it would be really nice every time you walk in and see curtains in the living room; it would be, the study would be an entirely different room, it would be really nice.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But all the time, I don't have the time.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It would reflect that also that contrast is kind of getting to you?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: That it's such that when you think of it now not being, I mean just like such little things that would that difference...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...and you're like torn.
CLIENT: Right. It really, really would be like that if I could. And I kind of have the feeling if I could find some time, kind of push ahead in Western Civ. and push ahead in the readings for the values class work perhaps I would take the time to sit down and do the paper but, if I, when I was, my way of doing that would just be to take a weekend and just lock myself in and just do it and I'd come out feeling great but I can't do that to Murphy...I can't just desert him for a weekend and I can't just say, "Go away, there are more important things to do." I could but I don't think it's fair, I mean it's not, it's not something that he would, he would kind of understand it but it's not something that would be good for him at this particular point, something that he would like...and it's very, it's very hard to get up the momentum to work intensively at something for an hour and now that you're going to be finished so it means you have to do such and such and, or you promised him you would stop and take a break and spend a half an hour doing such and such with him...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...to get anything done, because that hour doesn't make any difference considering the amount of work that you have to do. You can't look up and say, "Oh, I have a problem with something" because you really haven't.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. And at this point you need that sense.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You need to have that coming from somewhere and you really want to have, besides that that's your usual style...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...I guess especially now it's just the thing to have some kind of thing that you can say that about...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...that you've done something.
CLIENT: Yeah and to have. And it's entirely possible to sit down, if I could take three or four hours or just an entire afternoon I could finish this week's assignments...for the acquisition of values class, no problem and they're not that tough, it's just that I haven't got the time, you know?
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And Western Civ. would take me a little longer to catch up with but if I looked at it and I concentrated to finish it I could.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Freeman's class is impossible, I just started and I'm never going to catch up but I'll just do the paper or start, start doing some research on the paper, decide what I'm going to do it on and start working on it, somehow or other it will come out sometime, I don't know when but sometime though. Excuse me I'd like to go to the bathroom. [0:35:27.0]
COUNSELOR: Sure.
CLIENT: Is there one on this floor?
COUNSELOR: Sure.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: There's not one on this floor, there's one up a floor.
CLIENT: Upstairs?
COUNSELOR: Um, I'll show you where.
CLIENT: So like up above where it is on the first floor?
COUNSELOR: No, it's like... [inaudible at 0:35:38.1] [silence from 0:35:50.2 to 0:36:28.9]
CLIENT: [There was a man in that one.] (ph) [silence from 0:36:30.6 to 0:39:27.5]
COUNSELOR: I realized something which is I'm not really clear on, at all clear on how you see this time problem, like you said sometimes it's like...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...the time isn't there, like and it even seems like it's, that's a structural thing?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And other times you say that you feel guilty about this structuring...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...not structuring time and stuff, and I wonder if there's a way those fit together, whether it's kind of like feeling both though, I mean and I'm not knowing what you're saying there?
CLIENT: Well it's that I kind of feel both, that the situation doesn't allow me but that I don't take advantage of what little I have left, but basically I feel there should be some way in which I can restructure the situation...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...so as to get things done, that the fault does lie with me and that I just haven't taken control of what's happening and it's high time I figured it out.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And sort of so it's basically a guilt feeling that I'm not getting my work done and that it's my fault...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and other people manage to get their work done but I don't have time.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. And that it's something that you have not addressed the situation...
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...and that you ought to be taking the responsibility for?
CLIENT: Yeah, [I sort of think.] (ph)
COUNSELOR: And what like, and so it's not exactly like feeling like, like you're just out of control and can't do it but like you haven't faced up to, the fact that you haven't faced up to something?
CLIENT: Yeah, but also that I've gotten out of control, that I'm not facing up to it because I'm not, not under control if I'm not governing my actions as well.
COUNSELOR: That you can't even face up to it?
CLIENT: Yeah, but that I should but that I'm not.
COUNSELOR: Well you see yourself not facing up to it and like I guess I mean thinking that you ought to be doing it but every time it when it comes around to maybe that you could...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...what happens then?
CLIENT: Um, (big sigh) but what do you mean with that?
COUNSELOR: Well okay, it's like, um, a time comes where you, theoretically you could plan and structure your time, like do those times come, do you experience a time when you say, "Well I could try to do something in it."
CLIENT: Oh, yeah, all the time.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: When I first set up the new schedule, just for myself in my head, "I'll get this done and then I'll get this done and then I'll get this done." And I don't.
COUNSELOR: You don't care?
CLIENT: Or I - first of all, my reading rate has dropped so enormously because that comforts me...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...which seems it is very common, that it's very difficult because, it's also very discouraging to find that it's taken you over an hour to do 30 pages and which it should not be taking that long for that.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, so that the planning I do is always off as far as time goes, I never accomplish as much as I want to because of time, so I'm always... [0:42:31.3]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm, you always think you can do more and you can't?
CLIENT: Right. And with all of my other things.
COUNSELOR: And is that to say kind of planning for your [new low rate] (ph) seems so...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...sickening in a way...
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...that you hate to admit it?
CLIENT: Yeah, precisely and usually just like saying, "Well I'll only accomplish this" and that will be...the fifth page and so that will be tore out."
COUNSELOR: But it's very demoralizing to think that way.
CLIENT: Yeah, and, and very discouraging. Um, and I found out my first quarter, the fall quarter, that if I really kept plugging on it I would get through all the stuff and I would feel good about knowing it because I'd spent an enormous amount of time on it, but I can't do that anymore. I mean I really feel like not only am I not doing it but I'm not even begin, beginning to appropriate the time to all of my things which they need. And that I'm really not, that I'm really wasting my academic time here by just not, not doing my work and I'm not getting through with it, but it needs a huge amount of time to read everything and get everything out of it which I should, and that I don't have the time where I've - and sometimes I don't...
COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like seeing it flick away and, and trying to make your... [inaudible at 0:43:55.4] ...[out of the rest.] (ph)
CLIENT: And sometimes it's almost as if...the academics and Murphy were in direct competition.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Because...it's, it's kind of as if the restaurant we're there and actually it's this rock.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: It's the thing that I have to do and I hate it and I hassle about doing it continually but I might as well wake up...I'm kind of saying, "Well fuck, there's nothing I can do about it."
COUNSELOR: And do you want, do you believe that? I mean are you, I mean I don't mean do you believe it, it's clearly the case, but I mean are you reconciled to that?
CLIENT: No!
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: No, I hate it, I really, I hate that job, I, it ruins my day to have to work!
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And...if it's only three at first...if it's lunch, in the middle of the day, 11:00 to 2:00, the whole day is shot! So I'll get up at 10:30 because I'm exhausted...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and by the time I get out of there it's 2:30 or 3:00 and I kind of potchkey (ph) around doing little things and think about supper and go out and get supper and by that time it's 4:30 and I start to make supper and I've just wasted an entire day! And, um, maybe...I could drop the two hostessing days, just go back to working a regular lunch on Monday and could have my Wednesday free, but...
COUNSELOR: Well but that doesn't seem like the problem right there, it's more like that what you see happening is that when you, when you do that lunch thing, that three-hour lunch thing...
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...the whole day goes up in smoke from that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Now maybe it's like saying, well maybe one way of getting around it is not to do this three-hour thing, but now when you're in the situation of doing the three-hour thing it... [0:45:36.7]
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...it's everything else evaporating and that would be setting off everything else, and that really gets to you.
CLIENT: Yeah. And...just knowing that I, and like waking up on Sunday morning and knowing that I have to be there at 4:45 and it's 10:00 in the morning, the whole day is shot!
COUNSELOR: Is that like you have a kind of cloud over you?
CLIENT: Yeah and I just know that I'm not, like before I even get up I know I'm not through accomplishing stuff. You know I'll be, by the time I'll get going, because Terry likes to have a big breakfast on Sunday and he wants, Sunday is the day we should spend time together, so if I do manage to get to campus I won't get to campus before 1:00 or 2:00 and I've got to leave at the latest 3:30 to be home in time to change to get over there to have some supper for us to get over there but the day's shot, I mean it's gone already before I've even begun and I know it! And the only way I seem to trim time off it is to get up and have a quick breakfast and run out and then it's being unfair to him and it hurts when he doesn't...he starts crying he doesn't see me anymore and he's right...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...but the day is gone already. Friday is a little better because I don't have to be at work until 5:30 so that's a little better time. But the thing is...like winter quarter before he was here I used to handle it by, if when I got home at midnight I would sit home and I would do some more work or...on the nights that I did have free I would stay up until 1:00 or 2:00 working and I got things accomplished that morning, and...yeah, I was tired but at least I had the feeling that I was getting somewhere, and I can't do that now...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...unless he goes to bed early. And he, and he'll do things like sit up and read until I've finished, so that there's a constant pressure to finish sooner because he wants to go to sleep, he's tired, and so I, so, and there's just no way I'm going to get up early every morning and get up and read and I just stopped fooling myself about that, so that I'm losing maybe five or six hours a week that way.
COUNSELOR: Hours that you can't make for yourself anymore?
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Not...
CLIENT: Hours I just can't, I can't squeeze them and I can't stretch the middle of the day at all anymore it just doesn't work. It's just there's a certain rock-bottom minimum of time it takes me to read through the material, not to think about it, not to review my notes, not to prepare for anything, just to read through it...
COUNSELOR: I know.
CLIENT: ...and I'm not, and I don't have that minimum amount of time.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Because there...besides the schoolwork there are other things I'd like to do, too.
COUNSELOR: Okay, it's okay.
CLIENT: (big sigh) When I'm...not getting the schoolwork done I'm miserable.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And when I'm just sitting and plugging away at the schoolwork I'm unhappy because I'm very lonely and I don't see my friends.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And right now I'm doing neither, I'm not seeing my friends and I'm not getting the work done and I'm just being in limbo. [0:48:38.7]
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and just really cut off from everything, from a sense of confidence about yourself and from...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...things are changed and...
CLIENT: But I have this sense of no life and so I just feel deadened...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and it's just a, and nothing, nothing is getting through to me, I don't want it to, I can't handle it right now, I don't want anything to more to...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...to be bothersome.
COUNSELOR: You mean like it's like feeling empty but like you'd rather have it that way than what you see as the only alternative?
CLIENT: Yeah and just, just hassling with it and hurting all the rest of the time and I might as well...just like let myself get numb because it's much simpler.
COUNSELOR: So it's only things you're fearing if you're out of bed you mean?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I mean just, just pure, simple depression and a kind of hopelessness whenever I just let myself get into how I feel, like just bursting to change...just - and I just don't seem to be able to cope with anything that's coming down right now, so I'd much rather not, when I would just rather be doing as much as I can.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know, and that's something though that's kind of distracting, so just keep yourself busy and don't, don't bother looking at everything that there is?
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean which doesn't work very well I think.
COUNSELOR: But it's still very tempting?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Even though you know it's not a...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...side that's how you would theoretically speak?
CLIENT: Yeah. So...in the end I'm just left with a feeling that I'm not accomplishing anything, I'm not facing anything, and my way of escaping it isn't constructive in any way I know, so.
COUNSELOR: It isn't constructive, what do you mean by that?
CLIENT: Well a constructive way of escaping time situations that I don't know exactly what to do about, like Murphy's...getting a job and shit like that, it just isn't simple, I have to work now, I have to study, (yawning) closet myself off in my room and I can't seem to do that either, I mean I can't seem to get myself together enough to sit and move through my studies.
COUNSELOR: You kind of can't turn off those other thoughts and worries?
CLIENT: Right, I mean I kind of shuffle around doing mundane things, like go shopping, do laundry and looking at stuff when I was reading the newspaper and shit like that.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: You know just kind of mind fodder and it's just, just leaving my mind as blank as possible...
COUNSELOR: M-mm.
CLIENT: ...continually in this place, and it's really disgusting. And sometimes it's...like the few times I have managed to get up my concentration have been at all of the times when I can't possibly carry it through...4:00 on a Friday I have to be at work at 5:30. I start, I really get something and I pick up one of the books I have to read and I start plowing through it and I look up and I'm 25 pages further and it's 5:00 and I've got to stop, but I could keep on going for another three or four hours. [0:51:58.2]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: It just never works that way.
COUNSELOR: So always having the rug out pulled...pulled out from under you...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...if that's what you're telling me.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't have many blocks of time in which to sit down and get anything accomplished.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I have Sunday day, which is very difficult.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I have Friday day, which usually is the day that I spend to get all the little amount...like running downtown to pick up something and...shit like that, um...
COUNSELOR: I know it's difficult.
CLIENT: ...which I can't do it on Sunday, but those are the only days I have free except for Saturday, but Saturday is, Saturday kind of is the day that - Sunday is breakfast with Murphy, but Saturday is the day where I should take off...where I should clean the house or we should do something together and we go out on Saturday night, we try to, and I never, I can't seem to get any work done then at all. And I kind of feel that Murphy needs the rest and some real recreation and I should not put any pressure on him on Saturday that I have all these things that I have to do and it should be the day that I spend wholeheartedly with him.
COUNSELOR: Can you manage that?
CLIENT: (big sigh) Oh, I usually end up in a panic by the end of the day if I haven't done anything...I'm just as far behind as I was last Saturday, only more so because I haven't made up from last time. I don't know where the time goes, it just disappears. I just have been un - and what I need to do I feel is to lock myself in a room and get my work done but I can't, but that that's a selfish, childish way to handle it but maybe it's the only way that I can, but it would hurt him fantastically.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. So what's the idea of solving it that way?
CLIENT: It feels to me fantastic.
COUNSELOR: It does?
CLIENT: It really does, but...I've done that during exams, that's what I would do, "Leave me alone, I have all this work to do, I have to get the grades, just go away, find something to do with yourself. Don't ask me to take breaks, I'll take breaks when I want to take breaks, go away!" (big sigh)
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. And then there's something great for you in that idea of just completely setting your own terms...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...for once?
CLIENT: Yeah, I really like that. I think about just bringing the concentration around, just don't go through it and getting it done and standing up with it knowing you know your material...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and it's fine.
COUNSELOR: And also something in there about saying to him, "No, I'll tell you when I'm going to take my breaks."
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It's like you've got to make this allowance...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...but he really hates it, like he really does and you can see just...when he complains about it and then comments about it for weeks afterwards, and...whenever the next exam time is coming and gets upset about it and then he starts complaining again, so. [0:55:11.5]
COUNSELOR: I know.
CLIENT: So it's sort of... [inaudible at 0:55:12.9]
COUNSELOR: What do you think of that?
CLIENT: I wish to hell he would stop it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know I wish to hell he would stop making an issue about it and go find something to do with himself!
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: You know instead of waiting around for me.
COUNSELOR: You get impatient that he needs you so very much?
CLIENT: Yeah, really impatient because, yes I need him and I like being with him but not continually, like...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...he has...he has to occupy himself and he has to find things to do with himself and he's got to stop sitting around waiting for me to finish whatever I'm doing...and do what he wants, and he's getting...and he's really moving and beginning to do that; things like there are certain parties that I won't want to go to just because I don't particularly enjoy the people who were going to be there, whereas he does. And before we would have terrible fights because I would go and hate it and want to leave early or we wouldn't go and he would resent it. And what we do now is if I don't want to go I go home and he goes and he has a fine time and I have a fine time, I dig (ph) that and I relax and I do what I want to do with that evening...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...which is read or...get something done around the house and go to bed early and that's fine with me.
COUNSELOR: You want more from him?
CLIENT: Oh, I'd really love just one or two nights (chuckling)...where I really could just go home - little things like I take one bath a week, why? I don't have the time to take a bath...if I take a bath I feel guilty because then I'm not doing my reading. I really like washing my hair and feeling that it's clean and that I'm looking good and I just...it's a big boost but I don't have time to wash my hair and now [rinse or set all the time,] (ph) and I wash my hair twice a week and I can't, I have to squeeze it in around midnight on Sunday night, it's the only time I have to do it; I resent that fantastically, I can't even keep myself clean! And washing out underwear is a hassle because what...in order to wash out big loads of underwear takes an hour or more, so I end up...just rinsing something out at night for the next day, and always forgetting about it until like I'm ready to get into bed and then he makes a fuss about it because I have to...go wash out my underwear. And this morning waking up and finding out it was my turn to do the dishes, because he doesn't like...having to eat alone and then having to do the dishes while I'm at work. So this morning there was this sink full of dishes from yesterday because it was my turn to do the dishes. (big sigh)
COUNSELOR: And when something like that hits you on top of everything else...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...then?
CLIENT: Oh, I was just really pissed...what is he showing?
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. [0:58:07.4]
CLIENT: Here I have, here I am, I've slept through one class, kind of I'm trying to - I had to decide whether I was going to get up and schlep myself to campus, I mean not and not comprehending it because I was exhausted, and realized that was stupid so I just went back to sleep; and I got up and I was (yawning) late even then and had to get here; and he comes in with, "You know the dishes are in the sink for you." I really wanted to belt him one.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So, and they're still there and I'll do them when I get home.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but what...
CLIENT: But I'm feeling really...
COUNSELOR: Yeah, so what happens when he lays that on you and, and you're really furious and upset, right? Like, "who in the hell does he think he is" when all this...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...does is completely... [overlapping voices at 0:58:50.1]
CLIENT: Yeah...all - I just begin resenting him fantastically because what's - and I feel very unfair because I fell basically, what the fuck is he doing?! You know he's sitting around and he's writing, which he's always wanted to do...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and he's going to see the movies he wants to see, he's having people over; like in many ways what's happening with him is he's getting all the advantages of living with somebody but yet being free enough to date other people, which he does, he can because he likes...if he's going out to various things he wants company...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...so that at least one or two people that he sees frequently and goes out with.
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: Well I don't have anything like that.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. Yeah and, and you can't have it, then...
CLIENT: No, absolutely not because the free time I have has to go to him!
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see, it's a logical thing, like the time doesn't let you have it but he also doesn't let you have it.
CLIENT: Right. And, uh, like I don't know whether I want it or not but...the whole thing kind of just dulling (ph) sometimes.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you don't know if you want it but you aren't really given any room to...
CLIENT: To find out.
COUNSELOR: ...to find out, yeah.
CLIENT: And...the whole household things...and with - there are just times when I really want to just hit him over the head and say, "go out damn it".
COUNSELOR: I know.
CLIENT: "I'm doing so much; couldn't you just do a little more as...as far as doing the dishes this once and all the stupid little things you get upset about?"
COUNSELOR: M-hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: Like bringing...
COUNSELOR: "How could it mean that much to you?"
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It's the final thing in terms of your life...
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...you know, "it's the final straw" you need to tell him.
CLIENT: Yeah. Then...stupid little things like he hates doing the dishes and so for months and months he went on about how he hated doing the dishes because, well he didn't have an apron and so that every time he did the dishes he got wet. And I promised him I would make him an apron, so he nudged about that until finally I bought the material. And he kept on making, dropping little comments, until finally I made the apron. God damn if he doesn't hate doing the dishes every bit as fucking much as he did before...
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: ...with an apron that's made of terrycloth and corduroy that's super thick so that he can't possibly get wet unless he drops a pot on top of his head...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and I still get the same crap about he doesn't, he hates to do the dishes, like I don't know. (sighing) [1:01:16.9]
COUNSELOR: And you completely, I guess you mean what's so terrible about that is you completely put yourself out, you really thought you were going to solve that thing.
CLIENT: No, I knew I wasn't.
COUNSELOR: You knew you weren't?
CLIENT: I knew I wasn't.
COUNSELOR: But?
CLIENT: But I...
COUNSELOR: You were going to try?
CLIENT: Yeah, I was going to try...there was a, there was a possibility that maybe if he'd, if he got his damn apron he would do more...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...do more of the dishes without complaining. But, uh...I've, there are times that I really have restrained myself, I've never said to him, "Well you've got your apron now, what are you crapping about?"
COUNSELOR: (chuckling) And you want to because of what...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...I mean, well no, why do you want to, because I guess it isn't that you really, you never thought it would really solve anything but...
CLIENT: Well it's just it's really annoying to me, dishes, dishes - there are certain housework things that have to be done. I mean if you don't wash your dishes you don't have dishes to eat off, (chuckling) it's that simple, and if you wash them piece by piece they last forever. However, if you look at them and say, "Okay, I can do this in five or ten minutes." I'll do it and kind of just, "just do it"; they're finished, they're done...you've finished the dishes! And I said, "You clean up as soon as you clean up the stove, you sweep the floor and your kitchen is, is comparatively clean and that's it, it's finished!"
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: It's taken you ten minutes, okay, 15 if it's been a big dinner but that's all, and once, and once you've done it you say "it's done" and you kind of just leave it in the kitchen, but if you complain about it for ten minutes beforehand and if you, if you complain about it for 15 minutes beforehand, it's taking up close to an hour.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And he complains about it continually and he worries about who is going to do the dishes and he resents that he has to do the dishes, and he gets upset that he had to eat by himself and do his own three dishes and a pot! Well (chuckling) my feeling about it is that if...he would simply do it and find something else to do afterwards and not complain about it (counselor chuckling) beforehand and after it would be that...
COUNSELOR: You would think that, yeah.
CLIENT: ...that it wouldn't be as big a production, that's he's making it into something completely absurd...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...when it doesn't take that much effort!
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. It's like it is no big deal in any way that you can see, unless a person whips themselves up into making it a big deal.
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: And so it's like, well I guess in a certain way this, the thing about the apron is, "Look, I see through you", you know? Yeah, especially if just...
COUNSELOR: Yeah...you say, you say that what upsets you about doing the dishes is you get your clothes wet and that makes you uncomfortable but you, you're not getting your clothes wet now.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So there's something, and...
COUNSELOR: And you still feel it...
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...then?
CLIENT: And there's something about...about doing the dishes which is upsetting you...
COUNSELOR: and you kind of...
CLIENT: ...about doing housework or something.
COUNSELOR: ...want to say, "Oh, come on!"
CLIENT: Yeah..."What's really behind this and can't you get rid of it, it's driving me crazy?" Kind of like - what do I do that's kind of banality? The think I never have time to do is change the kitty litter... [1:04:18.3]
COUNSELOR: [I see.] (ph)
CLIENT: ...which...I do find time to do but it drives him crazy (counselor chuckling) that I, that I don't do it exactly when he thinks it should be done, and in kind of the way I feel about the way he does the dishes. On the other hand, I'm perfectly willing, after a big dinner when we've had wine and a couple of drinks, to let the dishes set in the sink until the next morning; and I'll get up the next morning and I'll walk in and they won't bother me and I'll do them, it'll take me ten minutes...
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: ...it'll drive him crazy, he can't do it.
COUNSELOR: The dishes?
CLIENT: Right or that I would leave the dishes. It's my turn to do the dishes and I admit that and that's fine, I'll do them when I get up. If he gets up before I do and the dishes are there then it drives him mad. You know that all kinds of little nuisance-value (ph) things and I guess what happens is I don't understand, I can't sympathize with his hatred of doing the dishes, to me it's just too unimportant to get hassled about.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So there's some, some of his little picadaoes (ph) that I can sympathize with, things like he's very picky about his records and his record player and now I can understand that...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...it's expensive to replace records and then his record player is something that breaks easily but...little things like the dishes just aren't worth the hassle.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. So what is it when he, when he does something like that it seems incredibly unreasonable to you?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: That's when this thing starts really building up inside of you I guess?
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
COUNSELOR: It really seems to?
CLIENT: Yeah, I get really pissed and I also get kind of mad at myself because I feel I shouldn't be pissed, I should understand what's behind it, what he's feeling.
COUNSELOR: You should be able to figure out how come it matters to him about the dishes?
CLIENT: Right and I should be able to understand and make allowances but...
COUNSELOR: I see, not only figure out but also not be bothered?
CLIENT: Right but it does bother me, it really pisses me off.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: You know...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...dishes are something you do and if you don't have time to do them right then you do them when you have time, they're not, they're not the paramount, leading thing of...what I do in the kitchen is I have to worry about the dishes, it's just not that important.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: I mean when you do them you do them.
COUNSELOR: Right. I guess another thing, it bothers you that he's like this but it's he takes up your mind space with that, too...
CLIENT: Yeah, he really does.
COUNSELOR: ...when your mind space is already low...
CLIENT: Loaded, yeah, but he probably wouldn't...
COUNSELOR: ...loaded, why does he not want to do it?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: [I mean that's like at least...] (ph)
CLIENT: I learned there are certain times when I should just - or he's in the kitchen doing certain things where I should just go someplace else and do something else and not keep him company like he'd like because, like when he drops a spoon or something he gets really pissed and he kind of curses a lot and throws it around and (counselor chuckling) I get made, I mean I just find it nerve racking to have him throwing things around and, and being made at the spoon for having dropped itself... (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...it just drives me up a wall. I kind of want to say, "Oh, come on!"
COUNSELOR: Right, "this is ridiculous". [1:07:17.2]
CLIENT: Right, "This is absurd, why are being mad at the spoon? So you rinse it off again, what great effort was it to bend down, pick up the spoon, put it under the water again?" You know or like the spatula being large will sometimes fall out of the silverware rack back into the sink and this upsets him terribly! And it drives me crazy because...what I do when that happens is, well there's nothing that filthy in the sink that a run under the hot water is...not going to take off or even...just passing the sponge over it again, getting some soap on it and rinsing it off, whereas it just drives him up a wall and it just annoys him so much. So that I would just...when he does the dishes go somewhere else so I don't have to listen to him dropping things and getting upset about it, because like you always when you do the dishes.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And...just because...it took - it seems to me when something like that happens that what he's doing is just kind of radiating his anger at possibly his own klutziness, just off into the air.
COUNSELOR: And who it hits is you, m-hmm?
CLIENT: Excuse me?
COUNSELOR: And you mean and it kind of radiates over onto you?
CLIENT: Right...and like I've talked to him about that sometimes like he has a habit of throwing kind of temper tantrums at nothing particularly...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and not particularly addressed to me in any way but just kind of venting his anger out and he says, "Well I need to do it, it relieves me of my anger." And I feel what happens is it comes from within him out into the air and I pick it up, it's just kind of a static of his anger at whatever he's angry at right then...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and it comes to me, it always kind of lights on me as being somebody who is sensitive to what's happening and it, it just becomes very oppressive to have him temper tantruming and just throwing things off himself so they don't burden him but they then burden me.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And it's...this is the way I see it, whereas he sees that he just gets it off him and it dissipates. And so we...have many long conversations...
COUNSELOR: He says it shouldn't bother you, you mean...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...basically...
CLIENT: Yeah, he says...
COUNSELOR: ...when he sends it out into the air?
CLIENT: Yeah, he says that he doesn't think it bothers people it just goes away.
COUNSELOR: Oh, it just bothers you and not people...
CLIENT: Well no, it...
COUNSELOR: ...is that what...
CLIENT: No, it...
COUNSELOR: ...he's saying?
CLIENT: No, it should bother me either...
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: ...he doesn't understand how it, how it would...
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: ...be carried over to me...
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: ...that what he, the way he, he never really bothered to think about it, except that he dissipates, he...he lets it go and so it must disappear...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...but it doesn't, it carries onto other people; like when discussing why he would do things like that at home...like have a fight with his mother or if his mother would be asking him to do something he would get very mad...back at her.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. [1:10:16.3]
CLIENT: Just trying to explain that what happens is, "Yes, you've dissipated your anger but you've repressed your mother with it, you've put it on her, she has picked up...whoever you are around will pick up that feeling and you may no longer be burdened by it but everybody around you will." And, uh, that's kind of a problem where we have lapsed continually because he doesn't know, I mean he doesn't want to sit on it and kind of percolate it [in tube wrapping] (ph)...build it up into a resentment, it's just a flashcard of frustration, anger type thing that he, he...
COUNSELOR: I know.
CLIENT: ...expresses and it's gone, but it will in turn depress me and upset me and set my nerves on edge.
COUNSELOR: So it's almost like when you think about that there doesn't seem to be a way that both of you can deal with those things...
CLIENT: Yeah, where that, with them mutually...
COUNSELOR: ...with each thing? Yeah.
CLIENT: ...to a mutual advantage, and that's, that's very hard, so that's kind of what happens with, when he's doing the dishes and stuff. So I've learned not to sit, sit around and pick up his vibes...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...and just to go do something else, and if I'd be normally passing he'd be fine.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, m-hmm.
CLIENT: He then doesn't need anybody to pick up the vibes who is not there.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, there's not too people who need to vent, yeah.
CLIENT: Some people need to vent their anger on somebody else, he has no, no need for that he just needs to get rid of it himself.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So it's taking, so that it works out but it's truly a nuisance value kind of thing, doing dishes and is I mean...like - oh shit and I forgot to pickup time. Oh no, I don't believe it, God.
COUNSELOR: And is that exactly the kind of thing you're talking about that happens to you?
CLIENT: Yeah, right, exactly.
COUNSELOR: Like what happened just now with that?
CLIENT: So what happened was, yesterday I dropped off the laundry and - oh, it's such a hassle - okay, so I dropped off the laundry...
COUNSELOR: Oh, I don't mean that...
CLIENT: ...and I should...
COUNSELOR: Do you want to tell the whole thing?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: Yeah, oh, it's really...because it's complicated. And I went to work and then from work I ran to billings and then I came back about, in just enough time to change, to have something to eat and run over to the restaurant. Okay, I meant this morning before I left to pick up the laundry but I was too late, I couldn't do it.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Okay, tonight - today what happens is, I have classes all day long, I have a class that ends at 5:30, we have supper on campus and go to Spot Films, because I'm a member of Spot Films and I have to work one of the shows I work Tuesday night, we get home around 11:00, tomorrow we're going to be at Weiders. Now this doesn't have any effect on me because I don't send any of my things, I mean I sent one or two things of mine to the laundry...
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...because all my underwear and stuff, all the things I have to have from day to day I do by hand. However, right now all but three of his underwear and one pair of dirty socks are in the laundry... [1:13:08.4]
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: ...so he won't have any clean clothes until Thursday. Now that's really annoying, I mean if it were me I would be really pissed if I didn't have any clean clothes until Thursday. (big sigh) And it's a real hassle.
COUNSELOR: Okay, now wait, the hassle is that he's going to be annoyed at you and you think he'll be justified for that?
CLIENT: Yes, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Like you should've remembered?
CLIENT: Right and that it's going to inconvenience him, it's not going to inconvenience me at all.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: That's, that's another nuisance thing about the laundry, I will end up doing laundry twice on the weeks when I do the laundry because I have to do all of his and I have to do mine; whereas on the other hand, it's unfair to him to ask him to always do (ph) the laundry, because I, it's not his fault that women's underwear should be washed out by hand and not by machine, when it's a real nuisance value to find the time to follow-up the laundry, even though what we do is drop it at the Laundromat for a little bit of money they do it for. God knows what I'd have to do if I had to spend three hours doing the Laundromat work.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But, uh...and I just forgot to leave him the ticket, I've got the ticket to pick it up.
COUNSELOR: M-hmm. So it's just that, it's not to blame you for...one more thing (ph)?
CLIENT: Yeah, one more hassle, yeah.
COUNSELOR: And one more hassle with him...
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...not just administratively getting over there?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay. I've got to stop.
CLIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: Oops! [silence from 1:14:40.0 to 1:14:54.9]
CLIENT: And because, yeah, I guess I could run home right now but I just want to spend the time and get some reading done.
COUNSELOR: Right and it's like you think about having a plan and you don't, it's like once a plan gets in your mind...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...it's incredibly frustrating to have it distorted where...
CLIENT: Yeah, precisely because of some small thing.
COUNSELOR: You're really already into all that stuff that you're...
CLIENT: That I'm trying to do.
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: [And so you're asking me if it is right to try and say...] (ph) [1:15:27.6]
