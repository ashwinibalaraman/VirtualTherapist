<b>DR:</b> So how are you doing [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Kind of lost, I've been crazy.
<b>DR:</b> Hum, like how?
<b>PT:</b> Um, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Down like —
<b>PT:</b> Like normal.
<b>DR:</b> Sad?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> About something or —
<b>PT:</b> So like sometimes it's for no reason, just, just because —
<b>DR:</b> Not because it's rough with someone at home or school —
<b>PT:</b> I don't know what that means.  Sometimes, it's over stuff but other than that sometimes, it's just for no reason.
<b>DR:</b> But you're down?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Then when you're down you're pretty mad?
<b>PT:</b> It's not that I'm mad it's just that I'm upset like I don't even know what it's about.  Like I'll start crying now and don't even know why.
<b>DR:</b> So emotional?  Is it getting worse over time or about the same since we met last time?
<b>PT:</b> Well —
<b>DR:</b> Just get better or —
<b>PT:</b> Since we met last night, wi, ha, it wasn't happening the last time.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> We were here like it just it was like more or less a month like less, a little less than a month ago when it —
<b>DR:</b> That's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.	
<b>DR:</b> So kind of angry too, right?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> At home with everyone or anyone special?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Huh, everyone?
<b>PT:</b> Wha, no, it's more at school.
<b>DR:</b> More at school.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, but now with school out and being at home all the time —
<b>PT:</b> I don't really get mad all the time.
<b>DR:</b> Not as much?
<b>PT:</b> Not as much, no.
<b>DR:</b> How about sleep, how's that?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And thinking about stuff or just waking —
<b>PT:</b> Like I'll wake up and I'll go the bathroom and come back out.  I can't get back to sleep.  It takes me an hour to get to sleep.  I'll just lay there.  I'll go [INAUDIBLE] —
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> And when I start thinking about stuff, it makes me tired so I get back to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Hum.
<b>PT:</b> But it takes an hour.
<b>DR:</b> So when you wake up and you start thinking, what stuff that's happened the day previously?
<b>PT:</b> Not like, not like the day previously just stuff that's happened in my life like —
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> The stuff that's happened not now.
<b>DR:</b> From even —
<b>PT:</b> Way back.
<b>DR:</b> Way back when, I see.  I see so you kind of you think and think and think until you tire yourself and then you fall asleep.
<b>PT:</b> Pretty much.
<b>DR:</b> And then you're up again?
<b>PT:</b> Like, it happens like a couple times during the night, like, like the most happened was 3, and that was a couple weeks ago with it.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's like I get up and I'll go to the bathroom, and I'll go, go back to sleep, and I can't go back to sleep.  And I'll wake up again —
<b>DR:</b> Hum.
<b>PT:</b> A few hours later.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I was feeling why did I even wake up.
<b>DR:</b> Hum.
<b>PT:</b> Like I don't even know why I woke up.
<b>DR:</b> So when you think back about stuff that's happened from a long time ago —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> What kinds of stuff do you think about?
<b>PT:</b> Like well, all kinds of stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> Like when we came, first came to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Then like sometimes, I think about how I've changed and how I'm different from when we first came here.
<b>DR:</b> But do you still go back to that, and when you think about when you used to live with your dad, what kinds of feeling is that?
<b>PT:</b> You know, I don't know.  Like I just sit there, and I'm like, you know it's like I keep thinking why.  Why all of sudden I have to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Kind of obsessing a little bit because like why was I the one that [INAUDIBLE], the main question.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum, so you illuminate about it a lot?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That makes it even harder than it would be otherwise.  It must be pretty hard anyway.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Especially with —
<b>PT:</b> I'm like 3 years old so [INAUDIBLE] over and over and over it.
<b>DR:</b> Well —
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum, so you're taking the Effexor okay, right —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Then the Abilify, right —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> And then the Tegretol?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>CG:</b> Did you ever get the blood work on that [PHYSICIAN NAME]?
<b>DR:</b> And the Tegretol —  Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Five point nine and it's good.  I mean the lab says it's good for if it's between 4 and 12.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> But really it's good if it's between 5 and 12.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> So it's 5.9 smidgen —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Above the lower but —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Still within the range, so we have a little bit of leeway of upping that.  Now, you're getting the Effexor for quite a while, right?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> And before that you'd been on Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Wellbutrin.  Well, the, the Effexor is kind of on the lower side —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> So we ought to up that just to get the spirits up a little bit better [PATIENT NAME].  Uh, and the Tegretol is okay, and we may or may not have to up it —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> But uh, we may have to because —
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Because I said, it's kind of on the lower side of the range.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Let's first do the Effexor and see if that helps just with the depression the way you're describing it [PATIENT NAME] and the sadness and thinking back on things from the you know distance past —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um —
<b>CG:</b> And they we'll um, not touch [INAUDIBLE].  Now, would that um, help her if she go back, get up and go to the bathroom and help her go back to sleep?
<b>DR:</b> It will help her overall level of anxiety.
<b>CG:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Part of her waking up at night is her obsessing illuminating and the anxiety.
<b>CG:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> So it'll —
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Bring the anxiety down, but if we need to add something specific for the sleep, um, Trazodone often does, you're not on Trazodone —
<b>CG:</b> Hum—um.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Used to be [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Trazodone, I can give you some of that.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And that's as needed.  You don't have to —
<b>CG:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Take it, but if you're kind of up and about the previous night or the next night or 2 or 3, take it and if then you're sleeping okay —
<b>CG:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> For 3 or 4 nights, then try do without it —
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> For a night or 2.  So let's do those 2 before we do anything with the —
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Tegretol for now.
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] kids or anything for Christmas.
<b>DR:</b> I think so.  They're supposed to be getting there.
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Not suicidal or nothing like that [PATIENT NAME], right?  Okay, Trazodone we'll just do 50.  I'll give a 100 mg, but half a tablet —
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Should be plenty, um, but I'll write the prescription for 1 tablet —
<b>CG:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> So in case half doesn't do much, then you can use a whole tablet as well.  Again, only use half a tablet of the Trazodone —
<b>CG:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Even though the bottle will say 1 tablet.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, [PATIENT NAME] hope you do better, feel better, hope the depression gets better.  You have a good Christmas.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, you too.
<b>DR:</b> Thank you, see [PATIENT NAME] back in about a month or so.
<b>CG:</b> Okay, okay, thank you [PHYSICIAN NAME].
<b>DR:</b> You're welcome and keep warm, cold out there isn't it.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, it sure is.  I hated to get out today.
<b>DR:</b> This morning I know that my, the case the car was showing —1 on the way in.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, it's cold as hell, and it's getting colder and colder, but I guess I'd rather have the cold instead of the —
