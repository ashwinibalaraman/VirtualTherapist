BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Say what has been going on?
<b>PT:</b> Okay. Well, I'm still going through this roller coaster um, where, yknow, I have really good times and I'm laughing and, yknow, just enjoying being with friends and stuff like that and then there's times when I get really, really down.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Yesterday was Father's Day.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And it was really hard not having my mom there.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Everybody else was carrying on with the conversations, my nephews and nieces were over there, they're in college -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And um, yknow, all the attention was on them because my one nephew had just graduated, yknow, there's another one that's talking about going back for his uh, his uh master's.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And uh, me and my dad, we were just listening in on this and I'm trying to get into the conversations.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And yknow, be supportive for my nephews and my nieces and I found myself kind of leaning with my dad in just being sad, just being, yknow, it was just different.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It was different, I think a lot of it too, my mom's birthday was this past Wednesday.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and she would have turned [AGE] and it was kinda hard getting through that. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, but uh, it seems like when I'm with my friends, I'm not as sad as when I'm with my family, I don't know what the reasoning for that is.  I guess it's because I, yknow, I expected to have my mom sitting there in the chair too.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Yknow, yesterday.  I'm going through this, I'm going through like a different phase now where I, I need my mom.  It's like a feeling where, yknow, she's been gone now for four and a half months now.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It'll be five months on [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I feel this need for her now, like mom I need you, yknow, I just need you because I feel lost.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I have this lost kind of feeling.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> When I'm just, it hits me a lot.  Um, well, yesterday, I was over my sister's yknow for Father's Day, I had this lost feeling.  I felt it today.  I feel it, I feel it, it goes away when I'm with my friends but when I leave them and I'm going home or, yknow, let's say camping for example.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I camped with them already and it was a Sunday morning when I'm going home and that's when it hits me, it's like oh yknow, now what, I'm going home and I get this lost, kinda lost lonely feeling.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> My dad, his appetite isn't too good anymore.  I guess the, well it's Myeloma now is what they say he has. And it seems to be affecting his appetite more and more now.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So all he wants to do is eat ice cream and I'm going to let him eat ice cream if that's what he wants to eat, I'm going to let him eat it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But in the meantime, he's losing weight.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Like I said, he turned down his chemotherapy and all that stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So the doctor says it can be six months, a year, it could be two years, I mean it's a real slow progressive type of blood cancer.  yknow, it's not actually that that would get him, it would be, yknow, his organs, something would happen to his organs because of the low blood oxygen and stuff like that.  Um, so I'm still dealing with that.  I think I'm a little better in regards to the grieving I guess.  I'm still crying.  I'll have episodes, like Friday night, I just had a big episode of just crying, yknow, for like two hours.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But it's a different kind of crying, it's more like a crying where I'm, how do I explain it, where it's like I'm crying but I'm dealing with the crying.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> As like two to three months ago, I was crying and this was more or less yknow I didn't want to be doing this but now I'm crying, I'm like, I don't care that I'm crying, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Yeah.  And now of course yknow, when you're with your friends versus with your family, the atmosphere is different and maybe, yknow, when you are with the family members one of the topic of discussion that you anticipate is talking about mom.
<b>PT:</b> Nobody talked.
<b>DR:</b> No one opened up that topic.  There is a unique [INAUDIBLE] in your system to hear more and more about the good things about your mother.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And yknow, because the years that you have known her, she has been a model for you and now she's not there and since, yknow, in the parent's old age, you are the one who is staying with them, taking care of them, watching them everyday and all of the sudden yknow, she dies and uh, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> And I noticed that too yesterday how everyone else was sort of more, yknow, moving on in their life kinda, yknow, laughin' a little bit more, and me and my dad were more sadder, I guess because, like you said, we were with them, with my mom every day.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And yknow, when you go out, whether it is to your sister's or whether to any other relatives, yknow, brothers, things like that, and if you sit next to your dad, okay, you probably will feel the mother's void more than if you make your dad sit next to one of the grandchildren.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And one of the big boys and have them yknow, chat with their grandfather and get some old stories out of him and you are mingling with somebody else.
<b>PT:</b> He's got a lot of war stories.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, know, that's what you have to have your nieces and nephews do is sit with the grandpa and yknow, talk some of those kinds of things while you are with uh, talking to somebody else, that way you have the part that is now kept occupied by somebody else in the family.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, you'll feel let down and you'll feel an obligation that you have to sit next to him and keep him company.  
<b>PT:</b> When we get home, that's when it really hits.  I'll cry when I get home.  Like last night, I cried a little bit again.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And then the other part is, I had mentioned before in previous sessions, my dad starts going off.  It's like all we have to hear is those kids and their college and, yknow, and yknow, and he gets real disgusted with that.  I said well dad, that's part of the, yknow, I mean, yknow, and he'll say, also they talk about their dogs.  He'll say them and their stupid dogs.  Damn, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And then I have to hear that but then I tune it out.  I'm now getting better with putting that wall up, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> None of them talked about their girlfriends or things like that.
<b>PT:</b> Not really.  Somebody mentioned to like my one nephew, he said where's [NAME OTHER], where's [NAME OTHER] at?  Oh, she's working.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> She's working but nothing really, yknow, it's mainly about the college, they all just graduated.  My nephew is going back for summer school.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, my sister's, she's sad and upset that he's not gonna to be there for summer because we're all going on a vacation in the middle of July.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And he won't be able to join us because he'll be in summer sessions.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. Where is he going to school?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, in [DEIDENTIFIED], okay.
<b>PT:</b> And he wants to take this one class because he'll be graduating next June but if he doesn't take this class this summer, he won't be able to get in on that graduation.
<b>DR:</b> So that's, yknow, he wants to graduate.  Is that in uh, how many years has he been in college?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, three years now, so he'll get his bachelor's.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so in terms of, it's a four year thing, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's in, in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Now, going back to, yknow, how often do you still think about your dead mother?
<b>PT:</b> I think, I still think of her a lot.  I think of her, are you referring to what she went through?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> In that part, how she went downhill last year.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I think of that a lot and when I think about it, I tend to take my mind into different directions saying yknow, my God, yknow, she was, she's so much better now.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Yknow, I start saying to myself what she went through, yknow, with her legs swelling up and the liver shutting down like that, yknow, what she went through and how tired she was.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> In the night, I still think about how she grabbed my hand two days before she died and I still think of the moaning that she did in the last day.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I still think about that but I tend to think more and more now of how, yknow, what happened, all the events.  I think about like last year.  I think well gee one year ago, yeah her legs were swelling up but she could still go out.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'm thinking of the memories of what she could still do a year ago.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And now given what you have gone through, especially, yknow since -
<b>PT:</b> I know one thing I think about too.  This past last week, I was thinking, I was seeing her in the coffin.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> In the back of church, when we were back in church and I never really, I really kinda shut that out over the last several months but for some reason last week that came in my mind where she did the open casket and I picture her laying there.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know why I'm bringing that back.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay, well, yknow, maybe yknow, her birthday, remembering and that may help [INAUDIBLE] mind and all that.  With what you have gone through, yknow, emotionally and with all the care that you have given to her, at any time have you felt suicidal on, yknow?
<b>PT:</b> I felt that.  It wasn't thinking of suicide, it was thinking I was getting scared that those thoughts were coming in my mind.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And that happened probably, probably like the end of February into March and a little bit of April there where I was thinking I'd like to be with her and then I had that vision.  I mean I've had dreams.  I told you about that episode.  I had dreams where my mom's in it.  She's in my dreams, I'm hugging her, I'm hugging her.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And then I had that vision where she came down.  I mean, I was sleeping but I still think it was some sort of a vision because she came down on me.  I saw her head, I saw her face, the formation of her head, and like her upper body.  She came down on me and she grabbed me and hugged me and then she started telling me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> On my uncle [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> My uncle [NAME OTHER] who brought her in and how excited she was that they were preparing her to see my nephews, my nephew [NAME OTHER] which was, he was really close to her.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He died of leukemia, he was [AGE] years old. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm sorta kinda going through this over again, it gets to be recorded, it's just kinda, yeah.  And she was so excited, she was so excited, it was like twenty seconds is what I saw her and then she disappeared and then I started going into dreams that were based on that vision.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Now I'm having dreams of her going around the house looking for toys, looking for things to give [NAME OTHER] and that was just part of the dreams because I remember kind of waking up and now I'm going through dreams where she's in it but it was based on that vision.  I really believe I had a vision.  I believe it was her.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I have told a couple of people and those people have told me, based on their experiences with loved ones that they had lost, I did and of course I have a couple of people who are like, oh that was just a dream [PATIENT NAME], yknow, that was just your mind subconsciously going into a dream and I said no, I said there was very, this was very special, this was something that I've never experienced where someone came down on me like that, like she came out of the wall, just, yknow, and gave me this big hug and then she sat next to me in bed and was telling me about who brought her in and how excited she was to meet my nephew.  And that's another thing too, I want that back again.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I want it back. I want my mom.  I want another vision again and I haven't had anything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yknow, it looks like at least it's not like the first one with a little bit more on the realistic things, and did not, yknow, you really want to go back to sleep and complete the rest of -
<b>PT:</b> That's why I look forward to sleep because I think it's going to happen again and I realize I can't get my hopes up that I'm going to have that experience again.
<b>DR:</b> Just keep up the good work.  Now as far as the medications are concerned, what's your thought on that as to what they are doing?
<b>PT:</b> I can't really tell.  I know when my mom first was in the hospital.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Back in early December, I was a total wreck.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I couldn't even think, I was shaking all the time.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I was, I was just, I was a wreck.  I couldn't concentrate at work, I had to go home.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And this is because she was in the hospital and I seen that she, yknow, I knew the ending was coming.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And um, but yet I was still like maybe, maybe there's something they can do for her.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But I realized that, yknow, I knew, so that's when I started the Lexapro, back in the middle of December.
<b>DR:</b> Any side effects from it?
<b>PT:</b> No, the only, at first, I don't know if it was the Lexapro or if it was the other one.
<b>DR:</b> Seroquel?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, the mood stabilizer.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> What was that called?
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I felt -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Kind of sick to my stomach. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I felt sick to my stomach for like the first week.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> The first week or two.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I felt kind of irritable to go along with that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And that all eased up.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I would say as we got into the middle or end of January, I started feeling better and then, of course, my mom passed away on [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And um, I think it's helped.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I've had these irritable moods.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Since then.  Yknow, I had that outburst at work.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I had another one last week.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, this was because some young kid -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That started in our department about nine months ago.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He is a practical joker.  He likes to joke around with people too much.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And because I am so sensitive, yeah, I can laugh a little bit, laugh around a little bit but I can't, I can't, things get to me easier.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So he did this one joke on me that I just, I didn't like, I said I don't even know this kid, yknow -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I told him, I said I'm going to go to HR if you continue doing this.  I mean I don't care what you do to these other people.  He was getting on my computer and sending emails to other people.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and that could be instant termination when you do that kinda stuff.
<b>DR:</b> That's right, yes.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and I told him, I says don't do this again.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Because it since it is originating from your computer, yknow, people will immediately figure out that you're sending it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And if there is some, you know, language there that is not acceptable -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Then you will be -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, That's when I said don't do this again.  I said I don't even know you, you know, and he says lighten up.  He said I need to lighten up, I need to, yknow
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I know I can't, I'm having a hard time.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know, making laughter out of certain things.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yknow, other people seem to be laughing it off, what he does, but I can't, yknow, it gets to me.
<b>DR:</b> He has to learn a little bit more about life in general and real things in life also.  Okay, now other than seeing the vision of your mother, have you had any other kind of hallucinations, like her talking to you or anyone else talking to you when they are not there?
<b>PT:</b> Back in February, I had this thing where I heard voices, it sounded like two men or three or four men or something like that talking.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And it sounded like a different language.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I couldn't figure out what that was and that was only like five, six seconds worth.  I mean I woke up to it. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that was, was it soon after your mother died?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was about three weeks, about two to three weeks.
<b>DR:</b> You were not sleeping good at that time.
<b>PT:</b> I wasn't sleeping good and I woke up and I heard voices like and, yknow, like I talked this girl at work -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> She was very religious and she says I might have heard a little bit of the tongue.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Whatever that is, you know, it's something to do with Latin, it's something to do with, and then I heard, of course, waking up in the morning I would hear my mom going [PATIENT NAME] and I would hear that and that would be it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, all right.
<b>PT:</b> What else, what else did I hear.  Um, um, yeah, that's it and I was hearing that mostly in February and March, and now I don't hear anything like that.  It's quiet right now, except for the dreams.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Just, where my mom's in passing, where she's in the dream and then I'll say hey mom and then like Friday night she was there and I hugged her.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But other than that, it's been dreams where maybe I bought a car, I showed her a car I bought or something like that, nothing -
<b>DR:</b> Okay, all right. Okay, so yknow, I'm going to turn it off now.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
