BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, [PATIENT NAME] uh, I saw you back in November, on the [DATE]. Things were pretty, going pretty well for you, an occasional headache but I think mood wise things were going fairly well. Um, today was this kind of a going to be a regularly scheduled appointment or was this something more precipitated by something going on with you?
<b>PT:</b> Well, something is going on with me. 
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I’m probably scheduled to see you-
<b>DR:</b> You, yeah you’re scheduled by the end of February but this is something different?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> All right, well, tell me what’s been happening.
<b>PT:</b> Um, probably about a month ago.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm
<b>PT:</b> Um, I’ve been really tired.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Made me feel like, um, thought I would switch my medications um, taking it at night instead of the day time, thinking that would help me um-
<b>DR:</b> Were you taking both the Lamictal and-
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Cymbalta in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> And it didn’t really, I mean I’m still tired, um, but I continue to take it at night and I probably noticed um, about two and half weeks ago that I was getting depressed.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> More depressed and just my mood and thoughts and sleep patterns, that’s all I want to do is sleep, I’m not motivated to do anything, I have no energy-
<b>DR:</b> And you feel sad?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Crying?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> When you say your thoughts, what about your thoughts?
<b>PT:</b> The way that I don’t like how I look, or I feel guilty for you know, not doing things like I should such as you know, keep clean, I know I’ve got stuff to do go to down stairs and getting stuff organized in my office and I just can’t do it. I tell myself, okay this is the day that I’m going to go down there and then I just prolong it and its so simple to go down there and start doing things but I don’t do it I just cant.
<b>DR:</b> You’re lacking energy and motivation?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> That’s a bad combination. 
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm
<b>DR:</b> Any thoughts about hurting yourself? Any thoughts about wishing you weren’t around, running away? 
<b>PT:</b> Not really.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Hmm, anything else different in your life? Situation at home, drinking, drugging, anything there?
<b>PT:</b> No drinking.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> No just, no nothing really.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Different.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, do you, do you know what happened? Do you have any clue? You’ve been pretty stable for a while.
<b>PT:</b> I know I have, I’ve been doing really well, but my I guess in my thoughts of um, you now I’m doing okay, myself as to how I looked and how I perceive myself and lately, I’ve just been so disgusted with myself on how I look and-
<b>DR:</b> You’re talking about what?
<b>PT:</b> My weight.
<b>DR:</b> Specifically.
<b>PT:</b> My weight and basically that and my looks, usually, you know, I don’t with my job I just you know, wear sloppy clothes-
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> And when we do go out to eat or go to a movie, you know, that means I have to dress up and it’s just depressing when I have to find something that looks decent on me, that makes me feel good, nothing makes me feel good, it just I’m disgusted. 
<b>DR:</b> Did the way you look change or did, or do the way you see yourself change?
<b>PT:</b> I think both. I think, I think I’m gaining weight um, you know, it’s always a struggle I can never lose weight I’ve maintained my weight for you know, quite a while-
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I don’t know if could you know, I think I have gained weight. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, if it’s important to you to know how much you weigh, and not just by how your clothes fit than actually have a number, not that you should be obsessed with a scale, but you know, get on a scale every, you know, once a week, once every two weeks and see what, what the numbers are doing there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that would just make me more depressed then.
<b>DR:</b> Well, but at least you’ll know what you’re up against, you know, did you gain a pound, did you gain ten pounds, did you gain nothing? You’d like to know that. Many people don’t care, many people are overly concerned about that.
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> But if you believe you’re gaining weight, well, you should try to see if that’s correct and how much you may be gaining. You know, look, uh, I feel that we should do something here with the medications. But you and I have been down the road of being on many different things in the past. And besides exposing you to side effects, we may lose ground from where we’ve gotten to.
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> And, and because you had responded well to this, I mean I’d like to believe that it was not just coincidental that these medicines had something to do with getting to, getting where you are.
<b>PT:</b> Right, I know that they did.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, but here, here’s a couple things. Neither the Lamictal or Cymbalta are horrible drugs in terms of causing weight gain. It’s possible that either one of them could be contributing to your weight gain, but they’re not like huge, huge players in that, in that game. I would have some second thoughts about whether or not we should change, switch you from one drug to another drug but, you know, both of these drugs work different ways, both of them will help with depression, um, although I have people on higher than sixty milligrams the manufacture says it’s probably not where you should go. I’m not having problems with that, and I’ve had people do respond to a higher dose of the Cymbalta than what you’re taking. Um, if I was going to make a change in either of these two medicines I think my, I would lean more towards rasing the Lamictal from a hundred to a hundred and fifty. Now, again when we make changes, we don’t want to make too many changes-
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> And not know what helped, what hurt, what caused new problems or what fixed the problem. And so, we should probably take it a little slow and one step at a time. People have described Lamictal as helping to put a good you know, floor under you, a good support under you, to keep you from sinking down and I think I may have told you, Most people find that between a hundred and two hundred milligrams a day is where you want to be with that drug. I’ve had people on higher, I’ve had people on lower but you know, since, it’s been a very effective drug in this regard and for you, I think maybe if we raise it to one fifty, that may help things. People have talked about certain drugs kind of petering out on them-
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> And we see it more often with drugs like um, Prozac, and some of the SSI’s. I mean I know it’s been described to an SSRI, the Cymbalta, but I’ve not seen it as frequently. I don’t know if the Cymbalta’s petering out. I can tell you that switching from morning to night time should not make any difference in how effective either drug is for you. And you’re thinking is good that you know, certainly certain drugs can have certain side effects that if you move it to different time of day, you may help minimize those side effects. So that is, that was a good thought you had. Didn’t seem to make a difference though. You did or did not ever take Provigil? 
<b>PT:</b> Did not.
<b>DR:</b> Did not, why didn’t you ever do that, did I think it wouldn’t be a good choice for you or?
<b>PT:</b> We’ve never really talked about it-
<b>DR:</b> No, we have not?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-uh. I want to ask you about
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> The Lamictal and the Cymbalta, do they have side, side effects on tiredness?
<b>DR:</b> They can. But you know, again, you’ve been taking this combination for a good time now.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> So, so why are you-?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t- what my problem, my problem’s always been is my mornings are horrible. It takes me forever to try and wake up. You know in the mornings, once I get going, I’m fine-
<b>DR:</b> You know what, heres what, heres what I’m thinking, okay, I’m getting ahead of myself, but I’m. When people have problems with depression, sometimes they sleep too little, sometimes they sleep too much, sometimes they lose weight, sometimes they gain weight, now that type of a-typical kind of depression where uh, you know, you, or, or just called diurnal variation, sometimes that responds to different drugs better than other drugs. And, did, did you ever hear of this new drug called Emsam? 
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> It’s a patch that you wear. 
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> It is not a new drug, nor is it new class of drug, it’s actually a MAOI, Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor. 
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> And that really helps people who have some of the symptoms that you’re describing. Um, it tends to be activating simulating, its been a great drug and um, because it’s a patch, you can avoid some of the baggage that you had with the older, these drugs, this class of drugs that’s MAOI’s, they’ve been around for a long time. Still used, really relegated to the real train wrecks, the guys that haven’t responded to the other drugs or have been on it for years and years and years and it works, they stay on it. But it’s a pain to use these drugs because you can’t use um, you cant eat certain foods, because of the potentials of reaction that can occur and you, and you shoot your blood pressure up. You can’t use over the counter things for colds and coughs with them, for the same reason. And so, its been, its been a drug that we know is very effective, but, a class that has been effective, but we haven’t used it all that much. Now, I have patients on some of these older MAOI’s this, this new drug, because its absorbed through your skin, you don’t have to worry about any food interactions and I’ve probably used it about thirty people by now. 
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, and I’ve had really good results. Now, the thing is, um, you can’t be on Cymbalta and be on that drug. Because there’s another again, that interaction might take place. You should be off of the medicine for at least a week before you go on that. 
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes I’ve not followed that to the ‘T’ because I had a person two months back that was ready for the hospital uh, he was so depressed I haven’t seen a depression like that in many years, and uh, I had to act quickly uh, to avoid him ending up in the hospital and he, when I saw him a week later, he was much, much better. So, I have some reservations you know, of switching you off the Cymbalta and Lamictal combination. Here’s, heres what I, would be a few options to discuss. Maybe do this, raise the Lamictal to one fifty, lower the Cymbalta to thirty, and consider going off of the Cymbalta with the idea of you know, either leaving you off the Cymbalta and just having you on the Lamictal or perhaps adding the Emsam. You know, at a later date. That’s one option I think. The other option is leaving the Lamictal at a hundred and raising the Cymbalta to ninety. The other option would be leaving things as they are, the hundred and the sixty on the Cymbalta, and maybe adding some Provigil in there.
<b>PT:</b> And what’s Provigil?
<b>DR:</b> Provigil is a drug that promotes day time wakefulness. It is a drug that is uh, approved for people with certain kinds of sleep disorders and it without the, without the uh, the potential side effects of putting you on a, stimulant like Ritalin or Adderall can achieve the same effects. Um, its been very effective, it’s expensive you’re pharmacy, you’re, you’re insurance company probably won’t cover it unless you’ve had a documented sleep disorder, um, by way of a sleep study that says that you know you have this problem. Some of the insurance companies are pretty stingy about, I have samples I can give you, maybe forever, certainly for a long time, it works right away. So it acts to wake you up and stimulate you. 
<b>PT:</b> That’s what I need.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah-
<b>PT:</b> I’ve always had the sleep, a bad sleep pattern um, uh, at night. I’m always up at least two to three times at night and I think that’s why I don’t, it’s why I’m so tired in the morning-
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well you know, you know that, that I can, the, another option is leave things as they are, and, and, hope that whatever you’re going through is going change in a, in a few weeks or maybe give you some sleep medicine and hope that and leave things the way they are so that if you get more sleep that you’ll do better. So, we have you know, what I think are a good four or five different reasonable, plausible options that you know, that I could justify, of course I don’t predict the future, I don’t know which is the best choice to make and I also, you know, we’re trying to move things in a better direction, not go backwards and so, you know, any time you make changes, you can go the other way too and I’m hesitant because you know, you’ve done so well for so long. So, I can, I can justify you know, any one of these choices as being reasonable choices to make for you okay? I don’t know if you would benefit from a higher dosage of Lamictal, or if you would benefit from, from adding Provigil here. The, of course, there are pros and cons to every one of these. You know? A higher dosage of Lamictal perhaps you’ll have some side effects that you don’t have. Adding Provigil means uh, another, another medicine you have to take, uh, and potentially having side effects from that.
<b>PT:</b> Is it an antidepressant?
<b>DR:</b> Not specifically, although people have used it, as an antidepressant in some ways and people have used it as a augmentation with other antidepressants, it does kinda spark you up and promote a feeling of well being for, for some people, I’ve not had anybody have problems with it, it’s, I mean even, even very elderly people who are just not moving and you know, they benefit from it, but I’d, in fact, most of the time when I use that drug, I, almost, I almost think twice about not giving it to somebody because I’m almost positive it will help them and I’m also almost positive that their insurance company won’t cover it and it’s expensive. And I hate to have somebody do so much better and then say, well that great, but you know I can’t afford it. 
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> And when I say it’s expensive, I’m not talking about thousands of dollars, I’m talking about a couple hundred bucks. 
<b>PT:</b> Per month?
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm. But you, but you, I can give you samples and we can you know, they play all these games with the insurance companies, and it depends on who your insurance company is for the med- prescription coverage. You know, some are pretty good and some are pretty bad about it, and so it’s been a sticking point. They’re getting easier with it as, as a rule, but still tough.
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> So, um, the other thing is if we had to, if we had to let’s say we, we put you and it worked great, your insurance company would pay for you to have a sleep study done and if you’ve had a few problems, I’d send you over to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], you do the sleep study, and then this way, you know, you’re covered because you had the sleep study done and hopefully it would be supportive of…
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Of having that diagnosis that, you know, the insurance company would see as a bona fide uh, reason to cover the medication for you. So, um, you can see that there are potential ups and downs of any of these changes we make. Some are, some are going to be more risky than others, if you don’t mind taking a third medication on top of this, it may just be a temporary thing also. 
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, the beauty of the Provigil is it works pretty much right away. And you’d know within a day-
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Whether were moving in the right direction or not. So, we can do that, I, it’s not going to interfere with anything you’re taking right now. And I don’t think its going to cause any problems for you, the only question is, is it going to help you? We could do that for a week and see if that works and then maybe consider going up on the Lamictal or the Cymbalta. You know, it’s a matter of how much you are willing to tolerate here and you know, some people you know, absolutely not want to take another medication. Other people would say you know, I feel more comfortable you know, raising this dosage of what I’m on now. 
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> Again these are all reasonable choices. I only wish I had the power to know which one ahead of time is going to be the best one for you, to save time. And get you feeling better. What do you think?
<b>PT:</b> What do I think? I’m willing to try it like you said it probably it, it’s not an antidepressant-
<b>DR:</b> Well, it, it does help somewhat as an antidepressant though.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But it is help with the, it does promote a feeling of well being and stimulation. 
<b>PT:</b> And that’s what I need. 
<b>DR:</b> Why, why don’t we, you want to try it for a couple weeks?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then if it doesn’t do it, we’ll either, well we’ll move from there. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You want to do that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right, I’ll give you some samples and I’ll give you some prescriptions [INAUDIBLE]. Well I hate to do that because if we’re going to make a change. Well, we’ll see, I, you do the mail order right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> See, I hate to, hate to give you a mail order for three months of medication and then-
<b>PT:</b> I can do it just a month, can I, can I do that?
<b>DR:</b> Why don’t I do this, why don’t I give you some samples of, of everything for a few weeks. This way, in two weeks time, we’ll know what’s going to happen-
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then we can always you know?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Do it that way. That looks better. All right, let me get you some samples.
