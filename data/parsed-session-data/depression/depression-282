BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, um, so what's, this is, uh, the evaluation?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, my latest one.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so, what's the story?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, it's, it's getting scary, because I, I, I, you know, as much as you're recording this some, you need to, I'd like you to read this.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, it's, um, I've gone, it's been, it's very weird.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> [PATIENT NAME]'s improving, [PATIENT NAME]'s improving.  That's the general statement, and then we hit, uh, that, uh, that, that's basically the cover page, this is what the program is all about, you conduct business on so and so days, and his latest comments are anything listed under 522.
<b>DR:</b> That's true, you're working at home?  And weekends to keep up?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I, I had been earlier in, in, you know, just to, just to kind of get a jump start, just get a feel for, um, now, if you read the recent one, he says I'm no longer doing that and that's kind of true and it's kind of not.  I mean, it, will, I've reached it because he's writing this junk in there, uh, and I'm not doing it.  I, I'm basically going through and seeing what I got just so that I can feel more organized and if I have to responses to somebody, I don't put him on it or I just [LAUGHING], you know, or I'll do it the next morning, or, you know, but, um, you know, so that, so he thinks that I'm not -
<b>DR:</b> So he says, "He needs to show significant sustainable improvement in the next two week period."
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> "I'll have to show real movement," "he needs to show," "he has the knowledge and confidence to handle projects."  What does that mean?  I mean, in his discussions with you?
<b>PT:</b> You know, that, that's the problem is that there's, there's, this which is on paper, and, you know, we sit in a room, him and I, just like you are here, and him and I, and you, you and I talking, and nobody around.  He does the formal part, the stuff he has to write out, you know.  Anything that goes, that I work on then goes to his boss, who's a senior VP and if it's wrong or if there's an issue with it, he's got to document it here, you know?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> At the same time, in confidence of privacy [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> He basically says he doesn't want to lose me, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Does he say that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he does, because he knows this is, what the, one of the bigger reasons for him is he basically knows that if I'm gone, his work load is doubled.  You know, and not only him but, you know, there, there's a handful of people in my office that kind of know what's going on with me.  You know, whether it's g, the, another direct coworker who I'm basically equivalent with or whatever, and, and, and they all say that, you know, we can't do what you do, to me, you know, that's what they tell me, you know?  The that, and that there's things that I do in my job that it would take somebody else triple, four times as long, or maybe they wouldn't get it at all, you know?  So it's, it's very, it's very confusing.  I mean, the, the, the gist of everything I get, and I've even got this from my boss pretty much in, in a somewhat confidence, that the real problem is his boss who's the senior VP, you know, who doesn't feel that my work effort is, is, um, up to par.  He doesn't feel that I have the confidence or the knowledge of what's going on in the facility.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, you know, I mean, it's, um, he, um, um, I'm always compared with a West Coast counterpart who has totally different issues to deal with than I do.  Um, who, who didn't, who, uh, came into a building out there that, uh, was, was built from the ground up and the culture was generated right from the start versus something that I came into that was already kind of, uh, or the culture was already there and it wasn't necessarily good, so we're trying to change it is, uh, was, was not the easiest thing in the world, and, and plus we deal with older systems in my building where the other guy out there deals with better systems, you know, and the whole, the whole thing.  I mean, so he just doesn't, my opinion is the senior VP for me is really the issue and, uh, and I don't know, I mean it's, I, my boss cares about me, he likes me, he's also has to be formal at times when he needs to be, and I understand that.  You know, he, him, he's kind of said that, you know, I mean, if, if he was going through this, he would already be looking for other work and, you know, I mean, hey, I am, you know, I'm not, it's not like I'm not.  Um, but -
<b>DR:</b> And he's giving you a heads up that it's possible that he [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I mean, it's, it's been, everything that's been written always says that anyway, I mean, it's always a possibility, I mean, um, but, you know, but was I don't know if you read it we've had, how much a, one, there's a couple things in here that, that really bother me and, uh, I think I was here, I think the last time I was here was before my second meeting, so I think I've actually had two meetings -
<b>DR:</b> Right, that's true.
<b>PT:</b> Since then and after the second meeting, there's a bunch of things on here, a couple of them I, I strongly, uh, disagreed with from my [DATE] meeting with them and, um, and whether the instruction to me was not correct or, uh, you know, so I, I, I wrote a rebuttal myself, I don't know if I brought that with me, but, um, you know, and, and HR, you know, rheumatoid got the, got the, got it and I says, and then couple days later I asked HR because they happened to come down to my building; again, they're in New York and I'm in [DEIDENTIFIED], so they, they're only there very limited.  But they actually came down for, for reasons, um, not necessarily related to me but, and I said it, you know, I mean, okay, I wrote the rebuttal, you know, what happens now, you know?  And, and she, uh, says to me that well, basically, she doesn't really respond to it.  It's more, you know, she reads it so she has an understanding of what's going on, and that it's really more between my boss and myself, um, but at least she can be a mediator if she reads what I write and all thing.  But she says, I read what you wrote and she says, if he's, if you're saying this, there's some real serious, you know, issues here, you know, that, you know, there's, there's communication issues basically, or something, you know, you know, there's to that affect, you know, like, you know, are you, is, is, is he getting, is your boss getting through and she says, I don't know if he's doing this right, you know.  So, I mean, so I had that feedback and, um, so, but, you know, but, if, if you read this carefully, I mean, you, there's a couple things here that really bother me from the most recent one.  He's writing about something that was a team effort in, in one of these issues, and he's saying, it's not even my specific area, you know, but nonetheless, it's something I should have checked on to make sure it was done correctly or re, really, anybody on the team, but he's putting my name down to it because I'm the one that's going through this plan, nobody else is getting written up about it, even though the issue was really a team effort, not so much an individual effort.  So I read that and that, and that, and I told him, I said, that really bothers me, you know, that that this is, uh, thrown in there.  I mean, I mean, some of the, and other stuff he's writing, "two days of errors of a single type."  Um, it's basically the conveyor system spits out infor, if there's some bad data that runs through the system, it'll, reports it as an error, essentially, and it spits it out.  Well, "two days of errors of a single type."  We're talking 11 instances and, and eight instances.  Now, for what it's worth, the only reason I bring out those numbers is because they're so low in compared to the way the system used to run, like, and you know, we used to be talking and, you know, in some cases 40 or more instances a day.  You know, but then it, then, now the numbers have dropped to like three, four, five, and this 1 day happened to be 11 and I didn't have people in that could tell me what the real issue was until the next day -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, IT didn't, says, it's only 11, I don't care about it.  It's not, you know, so once I, once I found out the answer, I told them, but, and so, you know, he writes it in there that I didn't get back to him, you know, for two days on the issue and, and that bothers me because he knows I didn't have people that could answer the question, you know, so I, I, I feel there's a certain level, there's a certain, um, level of being picked on here.  Um, and I for, I really think it's the, uh, the senior VP trying to do whatever he can to, uh, to force me out, you know.  It's not, I mean, these are my boss's words but they, they're somewhat directed, uh, from, even if the, even the senior VP, he's actually not telling my boss to do it.  He will question my boss if he doesn't write this, write this in.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So it's one of those types of deals, you know, I mean, it's, I don't know.  I don't know if there's anything, you know, I'll be honest with you, another thing it's been talked in my family, my mother-in-law has brought this up and this is a, you know, we talked about it last time I was with you, uh, you know, I'll, I'll, and they're all asking me about is it possible I can go on disability.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I don't know if it's possible.  I mean, I would, I would need some assistance from somebody like yourself to do it and -
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> And I don't know if it's, uh -
<b>DR:</b> It, well, the answer is, it's on the table.  In other words, um, I talked to you about considering disclosing that you're being treated for, for something.  Did anything happen with that?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm not, really?  And here's where I, I mean it, I, when HR came in that day, it was, um, was last, it was the [DATE] I believe, if I look at the calendar, [DATE], you know, and we talked about the thing I just told you about, the -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And then, you know, she also talked to me, I mean, let me back up a minute.  On the [DATE] in my meeting with my boss, I mean, I told him, I says, look, you know, you've seen me taking medications now, I'm trying to push, I'm going through some issues, you know, I'm, and, he, he's writing that I'm improving, it, just making it seem like it's not enough.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, you know, so I mentioned to him that, you know, I'm trying to go, I'm going through some stuff, trying to improve, and, you know, so the next week when HR came in, they s, they talked to me about, the woman, the girl talked to me about it and, I mean, she basically said, you know, if you need a, if you feel like this is the really big key issue and you need a break, you know, you just go on short term disability or something.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And, um -
<b>DR:</b> Well, here's the thing.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> One thing is disclosing that you have a, a condition which is protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know, because again, they're supposed to make every reasonable, um, accommodation to allow you to perform well on the job.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So it gives you additional protection.  Other than their, uh, due process, you know, they do something and then they report it and they check in again or report it, you know, uh, so in addition to that, it gives you additional protection.  Now, you could go on short term disability, but the thing is, you need to be good when you get back.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and it's, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If you, if you go out and you come back and you're a little better but you're not really that much better, it's not going to help you.  If you, I would say if [INAUDIBLE] you go out on disability and you come back and you're fine, then they won't forget that you were out.  But if you go out and you're only a little bit better and it drags on -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And then people think, oh, it's hope, you know what I mean?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I got you.
<b>DR:</b> So we can, it, I would only do it if you thought it was really going to help things.  Now, um, to what extent do you feel that there's still, it, it's hard, I know, because it's chicken and the egg.  I mean, the way that you're being treated is making you feel worse.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But to what extent do you feel that there's still depression that's, um, interfering with your performance and to what extend do you feel there's still inattention [INAUDIBLE] interferes?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm going to say this.  One thing, and another thing I was going to mention and then ask you is, uh, I'm starting to feel like some of the drugs are starting to not be enough dosage any more, like I can, I can feel a little bit of lack of focus the last couple of days.  Now I don't know if it's because of the extra stress that I now feel as, as time gets closer?
<b>DR:</b> No, I think it's because you're on unusually, you're on a very low dose of the Adderall now.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So I mean, like, it seemed like it, uh, kicked in for a while -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, and, and now more recently, you know, I, I still kind of feel a little lost, I guess, I -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know how to say it, but I mean -
<b>DR:</b> Well, you're on the, the highest dose of, uh, of the Wellbutrin I can give you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, not to say that's not more that we could, couldn't do in terms of treating your depression, but for that medicine, you're on as much as you can be.  The Adderall, it's always been a low dose because you and the boss both notice, oh, you're better that week you're on it, so we left you on that same dose.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> We felt it was helping.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So, do you notice that it helps less throughout the day, or it, or it poops out too soon, do you have a sense of what's going on?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> Like, is it fine in the morning but not working in the afternoon, or is it not working that much the whole day?
<b>PT:</b> I, I think it's more not so much the whole day.  It's not as much, it's not as good as it was a couple weeks ago.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so why don't we increase -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And I would go, but you feel that it works for the whole work day?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, when you on it, that's what I want to get back to, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, and the duration is long enough, doesn't fall off like by 3:00, 4:00 or whatever?
<b>PT:</b> No, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> No?
<b>PT:</b> No, I can't say, uh, you know, one way or the other, can't say that it falls off.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Feels kind of, kind of the same, you know?
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  So, uh, why don't we go to 20?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, there may be a 15 but I, I think, given the circumstances, we probably don't want to fool around, I mean, I don't think we're going to overshoot it this way, and I think it will be more helpful.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, but there's o, you know, there's all these different [INAUDIBLE] here's another medicine.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> It's essentially the same thing, it's a slow release Adderall, um, but it's kind of a variation of being, seems, seems to last little longer, couple hours longer, that's why I keep asking you -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Is in duration or is it total effect?
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> So, I would stick with what we have, to not change too many things and, and go up and see if we recapture the improvement.  You think that there is in, inattention is, is playing a role in these, uh, errors?  I mean, I understand what once they're on your case, they're -
<b>PT:</b> I hate to say -
<b>DR:</b> On your case, but -
<b>PT:</b> I hate, I hate to call it an inattention, I'd rather call it, I almost want to call it attention to detail, and I'm talking about just stuff on a spreadsheet and missing a number, I mean, it just gets that crazy, I mean, it's just -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> But, but, but you did feel that you had made fewer errors when we added it, and now you feel it's not working as well, so -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I, I, I, I, it's definitely, you know, not, there's something not, you know, this past Friday I had a huge thing, actually, it, on, on a report I do in the morning, I don't know why on the f, uh, this was probably more a total lack of focus which -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Somehow I missed a whole section of the report to do.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And then once I real, I realized it after I sent it out, two minutes later I'm like, oh, boy, you know, I, I, [LAUGHING], I had a bad Friday morning, I don't know why.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if, you know, but, but, um -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So we'll, we're going to keep you on the same [INAUDIBLE].  Do you, does that coup, uh, I had given you like a card or a coupon, so that works for a couple more times?
<b>PT:</b> That, I, I think it's supposed to, but I haven't, haven't any need to go back yet, believe it or not.
<b>DR:</b> I know, but when you go for a refill, you still have that card?
<b>PT:</b> I think I still have it, yeah.  But the real issue for me right now, honestly, and, and I hear what you're saying and if I, you know, if I don't, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> This is the one.  I mean, the real issue right now is, is -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I have a week left or I go on disability or not at this point, I don't know, to save, you know, I, I don't know.  Uh, that's where I'm at right now.
<b>DR:</b> Can you ask him?
<b>PT:</b> Can I ask him?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Well, HR has already told me I can go, actually, that, that as long as I have the documentation.  To be honest with you, I brought it with me because they gave it to me.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I have to, I have to, there's stuff I need to fill out, there's stuff that you would need to, uh, uh, describe -
<b>DR:</b> And we could fill out the forms, but -
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> The question is, um, do you think that you're, I mean, you, you told me that your mood was much better on this medicine, but you think it's fallen back?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I, I think, uh, the last, the last week or two, I do think it's, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Your mood and your concentration -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Both have fallen back.
<b>PT:</b> I think the concentration is not as where it was like a couple weeks ago and, uh, and I don't know -
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> How much of it is related to this extra stress now as the time is just getting closer and closer -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And closer, and -
<b>DR:</b> Now because, um, there's more that we can do for mood symptoms, there's definitely more that we can do for concentration.  I mean, you probably developed a little bit of tolerance initially that the 10, which is a modest dose, worked well, but then after a while, you know, wasn't doing as much.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So what we're doing -
<b>PT:</b> You know -
<b>DR:</b> In a sense -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But -
<b>PT:</b> You know my mood, my mood, honestly, I, I feel it's, it's, it's a lot better this month.  I mean, the mood part is, I don't feel down.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Like I might have felt a couple months ago.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I do feel, you know, I, I don't really regret, [LAUGHING], getting up in the morning, if you will.  I mean it's -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I, I do feel bet, not that I mean, you know, it, it's just been, it just felt more, I've just felt better in my skin.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So the mood part, I think, it's, it's, uh, is not, hasn't really been a dramatic issue for me more recently, it's the, there's a nervousness, and it's, uh, you know, the, the attention to detail which they're always try to nab me on it, so -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, I think that it's going to be better [INAUDIBLE] increase the Adderall, so the question is whether you should go out on disability.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> And you know, I'm and, not between you and me, I, as, I don't want to have to do this, if you understand what I'm saying -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I feel like I'm [INAUDIBLE], [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Well, I understand.  But we ought to do whatever we need to do to protect you.  In other words -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Can you, off the record, talk with your boss and say, look, um, I am going for help.  I'm definitely doing better, but there's a lag, it's a process, takes a while.  If, if, if I'm going to get better, not in time to make enough improvement, then can he give you a heads up, can he tell you, look, you know, maybe you should take some time off because then you can continue our process, get you better, better, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know what I'm saying?
<b>PT:</b> I mean, he's -
<b>DR:</b> If there's, if there's any doubt, maybe you should take a leave because -
<b>PT:</b> I've, I've never, I mean, he, we've, I've never told him specifically that I have depression.  I've just told him that, you know, hey, I'm on stuff because I'm trying to improve.  I've had some, you know, issues that I'm trying to -
<b>DR:</b> You've told him enough -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So I think I've already, you know, and he, I don't, he doesn't necessarily know how to deal with it or want to, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Right, but it's part of his job.  So again, if you can say to him, look, uh, again, off the record, can he say to you, look, I don't think you're going to, at the rate you're improving, you're not going to make it, or no, I think you're fine.  That, that's what the, you know, because if you're not improving at a fast enough rate, then you should take the short term disability, we should see if we can get you better, and then you have a new opportunity when you come back, to hopefully be good from the get go, and then hopefully get off of probation, you know?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Because essentially I have two weeks left and, yeah, I mean, they have told me that whenever, if I do take a disability period, whenever I come back, they'll be, um, they'll be, uh, you know, uh, those two weeks I'll have to finish up.  She actually called me today because she knew I, that I was coming here.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> The HR person and, and she said that basically that they put a hold on the probation period for, you know, I mean, if, right now.  You know, for a couple days and I got to get back to them and tell them what I, what I want to do, so that -
<b>DR:</b> Can she advise you, you know, uh, I'm, I'm trying to get -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I'm trying to get some, uh, side information.  I, I -
<b>PT:</b> I don't have the inside information.  The only thing -
<b>DR:</b> Can she say, can, if you said to her, do you think it would be better for me at this time, given what's going on, to, and if she says yes, then we should do it, right?
<b>PT:</b> I don't get the vibe that she's going to, she's going to, one way or the other.  I mean, she's actually, I'm actually kind of surprised that how nice the girl, I mean, she's probably younger than I am.  I mean, I'm [AGE], she's probably in her early 30s, and, um, I'm surprised how nice that she's actually been through it all.  You know, one of the things I keep on hearing is, uh, HR is, is in the end, they're always for the company [LAUGHING], not so much for the individual for -
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know, it's like everything else, depends on the person.  I mean, they work for the company, they know who's paying them, but they're supposed to have a somewhat at, autonomous role where they're helping people perform well because that's the reason it exists.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> If, if it didn't exist, they might have more problems with people being out and sick and not, you know, so if they can facilitate people being out when they need to be out and getting better and so forth and that, they're helping the company's productivity, presumably, I guess.  I'm sure they're not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> They're doing it because they feel it's going to help their bottom line.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So, all right, so let's go up on that.  So the same [INAUDIBLE] but go up to two, you, you can take the two 10s that you have, you just, boom, tomorrow morning you take two 10s.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Until you use those up, and then you could fill this.  Plus that will tell us how it's going, when you take the two 10s.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And I, I guess I'm basically saying if you, if there's any doubt, then I would take the leave because it offers you some protection.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But, um, uh -
<b>PT:</b> I mean, it's, it's not that everybody is, I mean, everybody wants to be an expert for me in this situation, you know, my family and all the -
<b>DR:</b> Well, we're -
<b>PT:</b> They're all like, they're all like, if you can get the leave, take the leave, you know, I mean -
<b>DR:</b> We're trying to get you better -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Before there's any ramifications there -
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I mean, you know -
<b>DR:</b> But if, if, if we don't want to be a week short or something.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  You know, I mean quite frankly, I mean, you say I have the mild depression.  I mean, if you would have seen me a few months back, I think I was a lot worse, I know I was a lot worse, pretty much from February of last year, pretty much for like the, like February or March of this year, you know, once I started, you know, I was dealing with [DEIDENTIFIED] a little bit, you know, and, uh, sometimes it helped and there, certainly had a good week here and there.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But, I mean, I -
<b>DR:</b> But we've only been at this -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Like a little over a month.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> And so we're trying -
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> To go, uh, quickly, maybe -
<b>PT:</b> You know, this whole thing started for me, as far as work goes, it started hitting me in October, November, I guess, you know, with, uh, with, uh, issues, you know, before, before this probation period finally hit, you know -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So it's, it's not like it's been, it's been going on for a while, I'm just -
<b>DR:</b> Right.  But it, but again, maybe that needs to be explained.  You've only gotten -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know, and you don't have to disclose, but you could say I've only gotten the proper help for, you know, last, you know, six weeks, so, and we're working on it, but -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I don't want to come up a dollar short or whatever, you know.
<b>PT:</b> No.  So, all right, well, I'm going to, so what do I do with the paperwork while I was there, because I don't -
<b>DR:</b> Hold on to it because I'll fill it out if, if need be, but -
<b>PT:</b> Well I guess, and then I got until [DATE], so it's not, I mean, this is, this is next Friday, I mean, I'm -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So, [LAUGHING], I don't know what to do, I mean, I -
<b>DR:</b> Well, we don't have to have the paperwork in by [DATE].  You have to declare your, you know, that you're going to take the leave by then, and then, you know, you could drop off the paperwork and blah blah blah.  So, you know, we don't have to have it completed by then, but we have to decide in the next week, so that's why I'm saying, if there's any information you can get from either of those people, um, you know, if they kind of plead the Fifth, then I would probably take the leave because they are, like you say -
<b>PT:</b> They see, um -
<b>DR:</b> Thing to do -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's bad, you know, they, uh, it, that's basically the feedback I feel I'm getting already based on, you know, those types of conversations [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> I mean, it really is.  I mean, like they, they, uh, I, I'm, when it comes to this stuff, you know, a supposedly, like, my boss has been there for close to four years.  He actually had some, like after I came in there he hired somebody for a, you know, another position and the guy was only there for six months.  He never went through any of the stuff I'm going through.  The, they basically got rid of him because of some other things he was doing.  And, um, so my boss says he's never really gone through this process that he's, this probation period -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> He says, and he, he says, I don't know what happens.  And you know what?  He's probably right because we're in this outpost for the corporate, you know, that I [INAUDIBLE], so -
<b>DR:</b> Well, where are you at?  You feel like you'd rather just take the leave now?
<b>PT:</b> I feel safer, to be honest with you, at this point -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because I don't, I, I, I don't, you know, I mean, the, it, it, uh, I don't see a dramatic improvement happen, improvement happening that, that they're going to say, okay, we're going to keep you.  You know, I, I don't, I don't get a feel, on the one hand, privately he's telling me he doesn't want to lose me, but on paper it's a, it's a different -
<b>DR:</b> It looks bad.
<b>PT:</b> It looks bad.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so then, take the leave.  Maybe, you know, finish out the week and then take the leave.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  So -
<b>DR:</b> All right, so leave me the -
<b>PT:</b> Leave it to you?  Now, do, do I come back at some point if I, how do you want to do this?
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I, I, I, I and, and, and again, I don't know how to say, there's a a part of me that feels embarrassed about having to do this, you know, because I'm trying -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> To -
<b>DR:</b> No, you really do what's going to be best.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean, I got to do, I got to s, basic, I, uh, and in some ways I have to protect my, uh, my family or whatever.  I mean, I, I can go in to them tomorrow and I'll try that suggestion and talk to him and say, you know, look, I, I, I basically can take a leave here and that's so, you know, and, and, and give them some information and then see what he, you know, see what he's, see what he says, I mean -
<b>DR:</b> How, how about we plan to meet in a week, how's that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we can, uh, I guess we'll have to, and so -
<b>DR:</b> How about 7:00 on next Wednesday?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, is that the latest you have, probably?  What's the latest that time you have on a Wednesday?  Seven?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Um, yeah, I guess so, if have, I have to do it, we got to do it [LAUGHING].  Only because again, on some, and so -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, base, softball.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I, but I'll change the schedule again [LAUGHING].  It's not an issue, but I'll -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, we keep running into that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  For me, but I, because I, but that's okay.
<b>DR:</b> No one else wants to do it?
<b>PT:</b> No, it's not that, it's just that since I am the coach, you, you know, I feel obligated to, but, but, uh, yeah, mark me down for it and, uh, and we'll figure something out.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
