BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, um, anyway, how's the, what's doing with the anemia?  Are you -
<b>PT:</b> It's pretty good.  Uh, it's not -
<b>DR:</b> It's better?
<b>PT:</b> It's not as low, because I continually go and see my doctor for that, uh, so -
<b>DR:</b> Are you, you're energy -
<b>PT:</b> I'm really bad at taking medication but I try to keep up.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I know, but -
<b>PT:</b> To keep on the target because I have finally figured it out if I'm not going to take care of myself nobody else will, in, in a -
<b>DR:</b> So true.
<b>PT:</b> Very hard way -
<b>DR:</b> It's something -
<b>PT:</b> What I have found that out.  And, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Actually, if, if you take care of yourself, you're more likely to have other people help take care of you -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, even.  Not only that nobody else is going to take care of you, but I think the more you take care of yourself, and try to remove yourself from, um, avoid the bait and the traps that are there, the more respect you'll get.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And, and, uh, that's, um, that's quite a insight.  I think it is.  I mean, you know.  But you have a little more energy?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Um, but you're trying to remember?  I mean, you take the medicine more times than you don't?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> Another thing I'm trying to do is, which my anemia doctor suggested to me, is try not to drink caffeine half an hour before and half an hour after I eat so the vitamins and stuff will stay inside my body and not wash out.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah -
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> Because it's a diuretic, that's true.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So I've been trying to do that, too.  Because at the post office, or at home, and I'm running around, and, you know, I do 2 jobs, so it's, it, it's, like, very easy to eat a meal and drink caffeine with it, and then -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It washes out.
<b>DR:</b> Um, um -
<b>PT:</b> Only, another thing that I want to add is that we were talking in, in, uh, a previous session, or, uh, originally before when -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> When we started, that I noticed a lot of, uh, instigation at my house, especially when my spouse is around, from my in-laws towards me to start a fight with my in-laws so the whole house will go into chaos.  But now that I have started just saying, "Hello," "Bye-bye," to them, and not say anything else more, it seems to be a little bit calmer on my side, but I see them trying to do the same thing with my kids.  And I noticed -
<b>DR:</b> It's starting with your kids?
<b>PT:</b> It starts with my kids.  Especially if my friends or my family or anybody is visiting.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, my mother-in-law or my father-in-law will pass a comment toward my child that will seem like a person is sore to them, and they'll go into their anger spell.  And then it gets to the issue that I get blamed, that I didn't train my children right.  And then it goes through a whole different scenario, chaotic and chaos.  So right now I'm not only trying to stay calm myself, but I'm also trying to help my children recognize that, uh, they are trying to do this just to look good to their son, that they do everything, or they know everything the better way.  But if, if we try not to argue with them, then it, kind of, they just drop the topic because they know we don't really care much.  But I would like [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] to start seeing, uh, somebody, too, in the near future again, like, with the New Year coming.  Uh, I'd imagine -
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] or [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], okay.
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] mainly for his anger management, and [NAME OTHER] mainly for building up a little bit of her self confidence, because every time she tries to read, study or anything she gives up too easily and she loses, she doesn't have confidence.  Like, "Oh, I'm not answering this question really right," or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Just simple thing, like build her self confidence a little bit.  With [NAME OTHER] it's more like anger management.  You know, like not take something as a personal insult, and not start destroying property or, uh, saying bad words.  Uh, because, apparently, when I'm not at house, uh, at the house, and my in-laws get hyper, they use abusive language.  And my children have picked up more bad words in the past few months than they ever used to.  They don't even know the meaning of those bad words and they use them.
<b>DR:</b> What kind?  I mean in Indi, Indian?
<b>PT:</b> Indian.
<b>DR:</b> Bad words?
<b>PT:</b> And even, even English bad words.  They know the "F" word, which I, I didn't even know until I was like 16-years-old.
<b>DR:</b> Um, um, yeah, that's probably a good idea.
<b>PT:</b> And also, uh, I wish there was less comparison among the kids, especially coming from my in-laws, or if like I wasn't being judged all the time, "Okay, your mom didn't do this right," or, you, you know, in the front of the kids, and all the time.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I guess when the in-laws are not there, I noticed at least my husband and I have some kind of a communication going on and we can decide things.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> But when they come, they try to instigate my husband and put him on his, on their side, then it comes to a point that I start believing that everything they are saying around me is true, even though it might not be -
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> Even 30% true.  But, like, continually telling me that I'm not raising my children right, I suddenly start believing, and that's when I really start going into those depression modes, and, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I lose my own confidence, and I start neglecting my own health, and then I go into those modes.  And I'd rather not going into those modes, and I'm trying to keep myself [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I'd rather you not either.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> These little flies are back, [LAUGHING], I haven't them for a couple weeks.  Um, well, it sounds like when you can ignore them they up the ante and go after your kids.  Now, um, I mean so, I guess one thing to avoid would be discussing plans with your husband in front of them.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> But even with my kids, because they always -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Like, if my daughter sat on my white sofa, and she's using markers, and I tell her not to use it.  They will say, "She's indirectly telling us that we are the ones who spoiled her sofa."
<b>DR:</b> That what?
<b>PT:</b> That "We, we don't know how to sit on a sofa, and we are the ones who are destroying her sofa."  They have, they have this mental belief that everything -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Is going to be blamed on them.  So they also have this, probably their guilty conscience is killing them so they think other people do the same thing.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, your in-laws?  Hm.
<b>PT:</b> And that seems to cause little bit more chaos in the house, but slowly and eventually trying different things, different methods, coming in -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> These sessions, you know -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Slowly and eventually.  I mean, how, how long have I been coming here, almost like 3, 4 years now?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's -
<b>PT:</b> E, or even longer?
<b>DR:</b> Well, you saw me first in, um -
<b>PT:</b> 2003 or 4, I would -
<b>DR:</b> Five.
<b>PT:</b> Five.
<b>DR:</b> February of '05, so almost 4 years.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Um, but I don't know when you started, uh, when you started with [NAME OTHER].  I guess you saw me first.  Yeah.  Um, all right.  But now, who, are you, who are you seeing?
<b>PT:</b> I'm seeing [NAME OTHER] right now.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you started seeing her.  And how many times have you seen her?
<b>PT:</b> I think 3 or 4 times.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  And how is that working?
<b>PT:</b> It's good.  She listens very nicely, but sometimes she's amazed at the things I tell her though, probably.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean, you think it's like some, uh, things that just are, are so, well, yeah, you've seen a lot.  They just seem to be so hurtful.  You've been seeing her a couple months, all right.  That she reacts to that or that she doesn't un, understand?
<b>PT:</b> No.  She, she, she, she -
<b>DR:</b> She -
<b>PT:</b> Understands, but she also understands the fact that since I'm not really getting a lot of support at home, and I allow my kids -
<b>DR:</b> Wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, zero.  Not a lot, you're not, not getting a lot, you're not getting any support at home.
<b>PT:</b> Like, especially from my in-laws and my husband.  My children do give me some support, but -
<b>DR:</b> They do?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes.  I wish they -
<b>DR:</b> I know.  But, uh, that I, uh, I guess that's not something we talk about in, usually here.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> But, so they've always occasionally done that or something new?
<b>PT:</b> No, especially when, especially since you had a talk with them about anemia.  I mean, they understand a little bit.  Remember the one -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> One time when, at the visit, and they kind of -
<b>DR:</b> No kidding?  That you think helped?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Of course they don't like to come here, at all.  They always think -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because that's all they keep hearing at home is going to the doctor's office is a waste of time, that, so, they don't even want to come here because they think mommy is just wasting all her money for nothing.  But -
<b>DR:</b> Well, yeah, they've heard that, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And then they -
<b>DR:</b> They don't, they didn't make that up, they heard that.
<b>PT:</b> They didn't make up, it's like, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> They have been brainwashed to say certain things -
<b>DR:</b> Um -
<b>PT:</b> Like, uh, if they get angry, they start speaking the same language that my in-laws speak.  And [NAME OTHER] sometimes starts to get a little bit physical also, because he starts destroying property.  Like -
<b>DR:</b> Who does?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].  If he has a -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, [NAME OTHER], okay, okay.
<b>PT:</b> If he has a toy, he'll destroy it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought you -
<b>PT:</b> You know, he'll break it, or if he gets a little, he realize he -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Made a mistake, he'll come and, his, his anger is very quick.  Like it goes up like mercury and then comes down like mercury, too, very quickly.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But when he's at the peak point, it's sometimes hard to control him.
<b>DR:</b> You know, for whatever it's worth -
<b>PT:</b> And with [NAME OTHER], they -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Always keep saying to her, "Your just like your mom, you have all her genes so you have" -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but so, um -
<b>PT:</b> "You don't know anything.  You have all your mom's bad genes.  You don't know anything.  You can't" -
<b>DR:</b> So what does she, what does she say?  You should just tell her to say thank you, and, and then -
<b>PT:</b> Well -
<b>DR:</b> And walk away.  I mean, you know, it's, um, it's tough.  God.  I have not seen you like this -
<b>PT:</b> For a long time.
<b>DR:</b> For a long time, months and months and months.  It's like you have a pulse, you're alive today.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> I mean, you've been, I think it's great, you going every week to see [NAME OTHER], just about?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, right now, yeah, except for I'm not -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Seeing her because she's not here for Christmas.  She was going, after Christmas she was going on vacation I think for a week or a week and a half or something.
<b>DR:</b> In January?
<b>PT:</b> Right now, I think.
<b>DR:</b> She's here today.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> She, I mean she is here today.  Maybe she's leaving.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but starting tomorrow she's going on vacation.  So she -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, oh, oh, oh.
<b>PT:</b> Because I've been seeing her on Fridays, so, um -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's why she -
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Well, that, this is really, um -
<b>PT:</b> But I am seeing her I think [DATE] or [DATE], [DATE] I want to say, that Friday.
<b>DR:</b> I thought it said the [DATE] here.
<b>PT:</b> Whatever, the Friday is.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think it's -
<b>PT:</b> After the holidays.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's, the [DATE] is a Friday, but it said, I think -
<b>PT:</b> It's not that [DATE], it's the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> No, it's the [DATE], yeah.  It says the [DATE] here.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  I think that whatever you're doing with her, it's working, [LAUGHING], so, I mean, you know, you, and, again, you know, there's no answer that's great, because, you know, while they're still alive, and in your house, their job, as they see it, is to try to ruin your life.  I mean, basically, that's what it feels like to you I'm sure.  I don't think it feels, I don't think that's what they would say, but, but they really are not particularly fond of you.
<b>PT:</b> Either that or -
<b>DR:</b> Because you're not that, you're not bossy.
<b>PT:</b> Or I, not, not only that.  Either that, or they think, uh, um, what is it I'm -
<b>DR:</b> I don't know, you're not good enough for their son.
<b>PT:</b> No, they are too bored.  They are all the time in the home, so they are too bored.  They have nothing else to do.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, yeah, but -
<b>PT:</b> But they want the perfect, every, everything perfect for the son, but not everything perfect for the daughter-in-law.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But they, they're not very fond of you, I'll say that much.  And they, I don't know, maybe you should drive them, like, to that, um, what is it, [DEIDENTIFIED], like 5 miles from the house, and drop them off and tell them to walk home on the trail and get some exercise.  Maybe not.
<b>PT:</b> Exercise is not really, of course they say they are going to the library, or they're going for a walk.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I catch them a million times sitting in the park eating or -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I know, I'm just kidding with that.  But I know that's kind of, that's tough.  But anyway, so are we doing the -
<b>PT:</b> No, I just feel a little bit sorry for the kids, because they -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Probably have to stay home with them.  Uh, one thing, I'm not doing drugs, I'm not doing actively sex, I don't drink alcohol, the only other thing I do is go to my second job, which is real estate.  So, I mean, they should really thank that I'm not doing something.  And I hope my children learn something from this, too, thinking, okay, this, this is probably a better way to fight with, like, is maybe have 2 jobs -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Or instead of going the wrong direction.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And hope I set some kind of example for them.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.  I mean, uh, we, what did we do, we stopped the Lexapro, right?
<b>PT:</b> We stopped everything.  I think you just gave me Strattera for a little while.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  I mean, you know, we did, the Zoloft didn't seem to -
<b>PT:</b> I need something that will just keep me calm, calmer, or -
<b>DR:</b> What else have you been on?  Yeah.  I mean, uh, Wellbutrin we've been on.  Um, and you're off the Concerta.
<b>PT:</b> The Wellbutrin didn't do very good with caffeine.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> Because, uh, you know I can't give up -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> My caffeine.  I already told you that, so.
<b>DR:</b> Now, so, why did we stop the Concerta?  Um, is off of meds and a test, oh, because they, you were doing the testing.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, yeah, and we talked about this same thing last time.  Your internalizing all these negative comments.  Um, "I want something" -
<b>PT:</b> In the new year I really want the kids, like I told you, to start with somebody.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe not every week, maybe once a month would help them, but just something you know, so -
<b>DR:</b> Treatment, yeah.  So what, I mean, what do you, what do you think of being off the Concerta, are you, you're okay with that?
<b>PT:</b> I'm okay so far.
<b>DR:</b> And you stayed, you stayed on the, well, you worked up to what, 40 of Strattera?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You didn't take that, or you -
<b>PT:</b> Well, it's the blue pill, right?  Is that what -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, the blue capsule.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's the one.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so you're on that.  Um, so, you're off the Lexapro, and Concerta.  Does that, I mean it's hard to tell with what's going on in therapy, and whatever, but, um, does that seem to be doing anything?  Because what it could be doing, it's sometimes, I mean it help with, you know, focus, attention, but it also can help with the anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> I need a pa, I need patient pill.
<b>DR:</b> Well, uh, just -
<b>PT:</b> Patience and ignore it pill.
<b>DR:</b> Do you think, but do you think this Strattera's helping a tiny bit with that?
<b>PT:</b> I think, I think so.  I don't, like you said, without, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Because it does, it, you know, it helps with that, with anxiety associated with ADHD.  I'm, I don't know.  I mean, do you want to, you're not having any side effects?  Yeah?  Maybe?
<b>PT:</b> The main side effect is, like, if I forget to take my medicine and I have to go back and take it, then suddenly my body doesn't want to take the higher dose.  That's the only, only side effect I know.
<b>DR:</b> Because of you get nauseas?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, not nauseas, but a little bit like stomach tightening kind of?  You know what I mean?  Like -
<b>DR:</b> I, yeah, but how many, like -
<b>PT:</b> Like, like you feel the feeling of the constipation -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But it's not really constipation kind of.
<b>DR:</b> After how many days of missing it?
<b>PT:</b> If I miss it more than 2 or 3 days or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> I try not to do it, but you know, sometimes I just get into that mode, why take care of myself?  But I try not to go there now.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  I mean, you know, you can take it, even if you like don't take it in the morning, you can take it that night if you were, because it doesn't, unless it makes you agitated, usually it doesn't.
<b>PT:</b> Some medicines, like Concerta, but the -
<b>DR:</b> No, you can't do that with Concerta -
<b>PT:</b> Concerta -
<b>DR:</b> But with the Strattera, I know, it's a lot of, a number of people take it at night because it makes them sedated.  Most, you know, most people take it in the morning, but.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> A little bit lightness in the head, is that what you're trying to find out?  Uh, sometimes I feel lightheaded if I take the Strattera.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> You mean after you haven't taken it in for a while, or just when, everyday?
<b>PT:</b> Like if, like when I haven't taken it for a while -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And then I take it, then I feel a little bit lightheaded.  It kind of, like, I don't know.  Like, there's a headache, but there's not really a headache there.  And, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And it doesn't feel like it's at the right place.  Or like you're a little tired or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, that could be a good reason to take it at night if you forget to take it in the morning.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Take it at night then and you won't feel, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, maybe that will be the next thing I try is that.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Um.
<b>PT:</b> Which is probably better, because I would have taken it by 6:00 p.m., because I do eat early dinner and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And it's good to take with food.  All right.  Um, you like peanut butter?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes.  I mean, if you, if you, if you end up, like, missing it, uh, for a few days, take, take it with either, peanut butter has fats and protein that coats the stomach, it does a good job, or, you know, something like that.  It may help prevent you from getting cramps and whatever.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, like that in the head or -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I'm not sure if it's really like a flu, or a cold, or is it just because of the medicine.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  So let's, let's do this.  So this, so, basically, all we're taking from me is the Concerta, the Strattera.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Uh, and do you, do you have some left or not really?  You're almost out?
<b>PT:</b> I should be.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I might have a couple of 18, 18's or a couple of 10's left, but that's about it.  You wanted me to do it a week, week, right?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I might have 25.  I might have, uh, the, the, the 2 25 pills I had I gave it to [NAME OTHER] one day, because -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> He takes the 25.  But is there ever going to be a time when we completely go off these medicines?
<b>DR:</b> I don't know.
<b>PT:</b> Eventually sometime in life?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, probably.  But I just, you know, I want things to work, to be easier, you know, see what we do.  I mean you've had this depression that hasn't responded, um, you know, it's complicated.  So this is what I want you to do.  We'll do, like, ano, I'll, gi, I'll give you some more samples.  Another week of, um, 40.
<b>PT:</b> Now, if I miss the 40, is it better to start with the 40 again or, like, for maybe, like, 3, 4 days, or is it better to go on like a lower dose and then start building up again?  Is there like a timeframe period that it -
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Yeah, if you miss more than 2 days, like, if you miss 3 days.  All right, you're going to take 25 for a day, and if, then go back to the 40.
<b>PT:</b> Forty, okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I try not to miss it, but just in case, for my knowledge.  Because I know -
<b>DR:</b> All right, um, all right, so here's this.  This is what, we'll do 40, uh, 1 a day for 7 days, and 50, which is 2 25's a day for 14 days, then 60, 1 a day.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So I'm going to have her give you -
<b>PT:</b> Some samples.
<b>DR:</b> A week of 40's, 2 weeks of 25, of 50's, and 3 weeks of 1, that's not right.  Two, 3, that's only 6 weeks.
<b>PT:</b> But don't I come and see you next, uh, month, too, with the kids again?
<b>DR:</b> Oh, are you coming, too, with them, or just them?
<b>PT:</b> I think I do have an appointment with you at that time, too.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  All right, check with [NAME OTHER].  Okay, this is 1 week, 1, 2, 3.  This is 6 weeks.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> Have you turned the recorder off or is it still on?
<b>DR:</b> No, it's on.  It's on.  All right.  Okay.
