BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: This is Nelson here. And, I have (inaudible at 0:00:21.8) with client (inaudible at 0:00:30.4) Interview 14 with client (inaudible at 0:00:35.3)
COUNSELOR: Where could you have (inaudible at 0:00:37.9)
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:00:38.2)
COUNSELOR: Okay. (inaudible at 0:00:40.2) very unpleasant experience. (inaudible at 0:00:45.7)
PATIENT: Yeah. I got on the other drugs. Usually it's fine until (inaudible at 0:00:50.2)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:00:56.0) I don't know. I kept thinking that I should think about something — anything — but I couldn't. I mean not even related to this. [0:01:12.1]
COUNSELOR: Yeah. But just something to make the time pass.
PATIENT: Right. I would (inaudible at 0:01:15.3) Oh well. I feel like I haven't been here for a long time.
COUNSELOR: For a long time period (inaudible at 0:01:28.1)
PATIENT: No. I just came last Wednesday instead of Thursday.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: For some reason —
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It made it seem like a long time. (inaudible at 0:01:41.5) I think about that every time I come up here. (Laughs)
COUNSELOR: That you want to take off 10 pounds of (inaudible at 0:01:52.4) [0:01:53.2]
PATIENT: Uh-huh. (inaudible at 0:02:04.7) yesterday that the (inaudible at 0:02:06.3) might as well sit in the corner of my dining room and stuff myself. (inaudible at 0:02:17.8) I was so (inaudible at 0:02:19.3) I wouldn't have any problems with people because nobody would want me, right?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I saw the most incredible (inaudible at 0:02:26.5) 500 pounds and (inaudible at 0:02:31.4)
COUNSELOR: It feels like you would want to —
PATIENT: No. No. No. Not at all. (Laughs) I was (inaudible at 0:02:38.0) She said she knows people like that don't come out in public. Oh.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:02:45.9)
PATIENT: I don't know. I — [0:02:53.8]
(inaudible from 0:02:53.9 to 0:03:22.1)
COUNSELOR: So once you looked at this like repulsive or —
PATIENT: Oh my gosh, my roommate was getting me upset (inaudible at 0:03:28.9) because I thought it was sad and repulsive but I was kind of like —
COUNSELOR: Like (inaudible at 0:03:36.6)
PATIENT: Oh my God. She couldn't — I don't know. (inaudible at 0:03:44.1) anyways, that is my fantasy. It really did — (Laughs)
COUNSELOR: Like you see yourself (inaudible at 0:03:48.3)
PATIENT: Yeah. (Laughs) I thought that's not worth it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh well.
COUNSELOR: So if you're going to escape, that's not going to be — [0:04:00.0]
PATIENT: No. That can't be the way. No. (inaudible at 0:04:01.9) And I was thinking like you know a lot of times I think things about myself and I don't perceive them as — just the same way that I am here (inaudible at 0:04:24.2) And a lot of times I thought that I might be (inaudible at 0:04:31.6) and it comes out like (inaudible at 0:04:34.3) and stuff like that. And that's (inaudible at 0:04:38.0) Okay. You're kind of (inaudible at 0:04:40.6)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Basically.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And, so I was thinking about that. So I thought probably truer than I wanted to admit to myself. And I thought it was carrying over into here too. Because — let me think. I can't quite think of — you think that you want something to work but you actually don't. Will it prove to yourself again that you're bad or you're (inaudible at 0:05:20.3) [0:05:21.0]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Put yourself down again. And, I thought I was doing that in here. I really did.
COUNSELOR: Do you think this experience can kind of proves how bad you are or -?
PATIENT: Yeah because I don't know what it is that I don't do but I — a lot of times I'm waiting for you to say (inaudible at 0:05:48.6)
COUNSELOR: Yeah. (ph)
PATIENT: Just like that proof. Or to go the full amount of time and think well, you do the best you can. Like that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And, I think that's probably true in some way. Like (inaudible at 0:06:13.4) And probably you will (inaudible at 0:06:19.4) like I'm always thinking you're going to do (inaudible at 0:06:23.5) in some subtle way, I'm — [0:06:29.8]
COUNSELOR: Making (inaudible at 0:06:31.5)
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying that here it's like you (inaudible at 0:06:40.1) most of the time or for you to come (inaudible at 0:06:46.5) and (inaudible at 0:06:48.1) nothing is really different. And like —
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:06:52.8)
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know (inaudible at 0:06:56.6)
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Like honestly you (inaudible at 0:06:58.7) change.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Different but it sounds like you saying to me like (inaudible at 0:07:03.1) like you're sabotaging yourself.
PATIENT: I think so. (inaudible at 0:07:08.8)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I felt like I was really, really heading (inaudible at 0:07:18.1) And I started thinking I was (inaudible at 0:07:22.8)
COUNSELOR: Like you were (inaudible at 0:07:27.2) throwing away (inaudible at 0:07:29.6)
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And I've had (inaudible at 0:07:32.1) feeling like that around (inaudible at 0:07:33.8) But likewise, they were the whole time. [0:07:38.2]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And, I don't know where to — I (inaudible at 0:07:51.7) I'm not sure. But I think I've (inaudible at 0:08:03.0) so long (inaudible at 0:08:05.0) Oh. That's the other thing. (inaudible at 0:08:12.4) my boyfriend called me yesterday. And, told me something. This is (inaudible at 0:08:25.5) And then he told me that he's divorcing his wife and he wanted me to move (inaudible at 0:08:32.0) And I said to him, I can't do that. But I didn't say to him I don't ever want to do that. I wouldn't want somebody else like that's your wife. [0:08:52.0]
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:08:51.7)
PATIENT: I don't want to — yeah, maybe I just (inaudible at 0:08:54.6) and maybe I'm (inaudible at 0:08:56.3)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:08:57.5)
PATIENT: And I ended up feeling very guilty again at the end of this conversation. Maybe that's because I'm on a diet. I don't know.
COUNSELOR: So I guess the thing that makes you feel uncomfortable is kind of not telling him exactly what your situation (inaudible at 0:09:17.1)
PATIENT: Yeah. Well see the thing is though kind of the fact my mind started thinking well, how would that be? I didn't know. To go away with him. It wasn't entirely inappropriate to me which that kind of upset me because I thought oh, that's stupid. Really stupid. It was like blowing my mind when I thought about it. And I thought to myself you really don't want to do that. And then I thought, it's probably still what you want (inaudible at 0:09:48.2)
COUNSELOR: So you could have done that one thing wrong when you weren't quite sure exactly what you did feel about Drew. [0:09:57.3]
PATIENT: I think that's true.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like part of you thought that wouldn't be so bad. (inaudible at 0:10:08.6)
PATIENT: But I was unsure.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay. And part of you was appalled by all of that.
PATIENT: By my thinking, yeah. Not by in saying it (inaudible at 0:10:23.5) I told my roommate then and she laughed. (inaudible at 0:10:30.5) I told her what he said and she just laughed at me at him saying how could you (inaudible at 0:10:37.8)
COUNSELOR: Like for her, it was absolutely —
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Beyond the pale.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And there you sat half thinking yeah, that sounds like an intriguing idea.
PATIENT: Yeah, thinking in my mind all the problems that I had with him, I was blaming on his being married. Which I'm sure that there's two reasons that I'm sure that some of the same things would be manifested in other ways even if he wouldn't have been married. But I guess in my mind, that's not clear to me. Am I making sense? [0:11:19.7]
Like my getting upset and being depressed and all the things that I still do, I do them more but I'm blaming it on his being married. And see I never had a relationship with anyone who was free and I could see that problems would still be. I — that's impossible to do.
COUNSELOR: It's like you can't tease (ph) out what the cause of how you were was whether or the relationship was. You don't know whether (inaudible at 0:11:48.6) it was caused by some way you were —
PATIENT: Anyway.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Or whether it had to do with his being married. Like (inaudible at 0:11:58.4) knowing that.
PATIENT: There isn't. And I'm sure that's probably why I'm (inaudible at 0:12:03.5) [0:12:04.6]
COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:12:06.5)
PATIENT: Yeah. I was starting to say that. I really am.
COUNSELOR: Good.
PATIENT: Because I feel that I shouldn't feel like that.
COUNSELOR: I'm sure.
PATIENT: Because I do love James. And I — and for some time, I had this (inaudible at 0:12:31.8) feeling like how could you think like that?
COUNSELOR: So it sounds like kind of two different things. And one is I shouldn't feel that way about Drew when I feel some way about James. And that's wrong.
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: That's bad.
PATIENT: Right. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And the other thing sounds like I'm (inaudible at 0:12:57.9) This happened to me once. It's going to happen to me again. And what am I doing laying myself on the line all over again. [0:13:04.4]
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:13:04.6) a mess -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: When I think —
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:13:07.4)
COUNSELOR: Because you don't know whether it would be the case that it had to do with him or had to do with you.
PATIENT: But I can't afford to see.
COUNSELOR: So the risks are going to be too great to sort of experiment with that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. Actually when I had the (inaudible at 0:13:39.1) I mean I'm ashamed to — in my head, I was thinking well, he's going to do this (inaudible at 0:13:45.5) And (inaudible at 0:13:49.8)
COUNSELOR: Was that because (inaudible at 0:13:59.6)
PATIENT: Because it's like an easy out. It's like nothing (inaudible at 0:14:06.0) [0:14:07.2]
COUNSELOR: Like he should know about this.
PATIENT: He's asked me (Laughs) (inaudible at 0:14:18.9) so. (inaudible at 0:14:22.4) seriously and I was dating James before (inaudible at 0:14:26.2)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:14:39.6) Let me just tell you what I'm doing. And maybe you can (inaudible at 0:14:46.6) It sounds like you're saying look, if I — the thing that makes me uncomfortable (inaudible at 0:14:51.0) If I were to go with Drew in September, it would be like betraying Drew in some way because I didn't tell him that I had been with James.
PATIENT: Because also he would be second choice in September. I think. And I — [0:15:09.2]
COUNSELOR: Then that's the thing. I hadn't heard that.
PATIENT: Oh.
COUNSELOR: I just heard well, if it doesn't work it with Drew then I'll try it with James or I'll try it with somebody else.
PATIENT: But —
COUNSELOR: But it sounds like now what you're feeling is what I hadn't gotten is somewhat caring for James more.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And that's really why you (inaudible at 0:15:26.9)
PATIENT: Yeah. That's true. But I thought well if it doesn't, well then I can always do (inaudible at 0:15:32.4)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:15:32.4) shoe lying around (inaudible at 0:15:34.5)
PATIENT: Yeah. Well if I really thought that —
COUNSELOR: The other man is (inaudible at 0:15:44.5)
PATIENT: You see this thing with James; he thinks that it's going to keep on working I know. And, I'm very hesitant. Now not specifically (inaudible at 0:16:12.2) always (inaudible at 0:16:15.9) [0:16:16.1]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And, but that I feel that anyway I should say to Drew look, it's just going to (inaudible at 0:16:23.4) I feel that's the right thing to do.
COUNSELOR: For?
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:16:31.9)
COUNSELOR: But the odd thing to say would be something like not there's no chance but another you could say it would be something like you're second choice.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So, that's (inaudible at 0:16:50.0)
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't bring myself to (inaudible at 0:16:52.4) I'm not (inaudible at 0:17:00.8) too much. I'm - at all times. [0:17:06.2]
COUNSELOR: Yeah. No. I wasn't saying —
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You should be.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I was just speaking on from what that would be if you were.
PATIENT: Yeah. If I were — there's some things I know of because (inaudible at 0:17:21.5) And, I must feel like I'm — I don't know — making (inaudible at 0:17:39.1) And that's how I still feel about it.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:17:47.5)
PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe I shouldn't (inaudible at 0:17:53.2) myself about it and not think about it at all.
COUNSELOR: Wait (inaudible at 0:17:59.7) something about what exactly? [0:18:02.5]
PATIENT: Neil.
COUNSELOR: All right, the whole subject. (inaudible at 0:18:06.0)
PATIENT: Sure.
COUNSELOR: So that's sort of like not thinking about a pink elephant, isn't it?
PATIENT: Well he calls me. I mean sometimes he calls me.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So sometimes I have to think about it. But the rest of the time I don't. But when he calls me, I mean just I guess I must be dissatisfied with what I say. But I — I'm not sure if I don't say anything to him because of hurting him or because (inaudible at 0:18:52.8) destroying my image. And it's probably a combination of both. (inaudible at 0:18:56.5)
COUNSELOR: Whether you're doing it for him or for you? [0:19:00.5]
PATIENT: I'm sure that it's some of both. But it might be (inaudible at 0:19:06.7) I don't know. Like in the beginning when I was breaking up with him, it probably would have been, in the long run, easier on him if I would have told him that there was somebody else (inaudible at 0:19:21.9) At the time, it probably would have been more (inaudible at 0:19:25.4) he would have (inaudible at 0:19:28.5) probably not (inaudible at 0:19:32.8)
COUNSELOR: Like your not telling him about James and kind of leading him and kept (inaudible at 0:19:39.0)
PATIENT: I tried (inaudible at 0:19:40.8) to run but I tried — I also didn't tell him about James. And I — maybe that's why (inaudible at 0:19:50.0) because of (inaudible at 0:19:54.3) with James (inaudible at 0:19:55.7)
COUNSELOR: Like some sort of guilty secret. [0:20:06.7]
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:20:10.1)
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: That won't make (inaudible at 0:20:12.0)
PATIENT: I don't know. On the other hand, I'm — I don't know (inaudible at 0:20:26.3) Drew ran into my roommate at (inaudible at 0:20:35.5) a couple of months ago. And he was talking to him about me for a long time and I guess (inaudible at 0:20:45.4) got fed up with all of this and said look, she's been dating someone else since October. And I think she's living with him now. And he (inaudible at 0:20:55.9) It's like I had already gotten myself in so far, I couldn't at that time (inaudible at 0:21:12.4) I probably should have then (inaudible at 0:21:16.6) [0:21:17.9]
COUNSELOR: What do you mean you've gotten yourself into (inaudible at 0:21:19.4)
PATIENT: With not telling him about James. Telling him yes, I was dating people but not real seriously or -
COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. You already led him on so much that like even though he told you in this kind of blatant thing like you're really stuck with it.
PATIENT: And he believed me though.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Sounds like that has some impact on (inaudible at 0:21:39.6)
PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:21:42.2) guilty.
COUNSELOR: Like he was some sort of — some — like you've been trying to pull the wool over a little his eyes and (inaudible at 0:21:55.7)
PATIENT: Yeah. And that's probably because I think (inaudible at 0:21:59.1) because he would never believe that I didn't sleep with all these other men and (inaudible at 0:22:06.3) [0:22:07.3]
COUNSELOR: Like you think that he would be what?
PATIENT: I don't know. I think (inaudible at 0:22:28.8) I don't know. He always said I was (inaudible at 0:22:41.2) He doesn't like women very well. He says that I (inaudible at 0:22:44.3) maybe to laugh at him.
COUNSELOR: Laugh at him like know something (inaudible at 0:23:08.4) [0:23:08.8]
PATIENT: I don't know. I mean I didn't laugh (inaudible at 0:23:15.2) I never even thought ha ha, you don't know what I'm doing. I didn't feel (inaudible at 0:23:18.8)
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.
PATIENT: And as I was trying to (inaudible at 0:23:23.4) strange way that was (inaudible at 0:23:26.3)
COUNSELOR: What's that about? I know you want to be honest.
PATIENT: Well I thought of (inaudible at 0:23:33.9) the best I was fair to him.
COUNSELOR: And you felt guilty because you were being unfair to him. But now you're saying; I'm going to be unfair to him if I tell him. So, the logic of that suggests, right, that you shouldn't feel guilty. You should feel guilty if you did tell him. But there's something that doesn't sit right with you in that.
PATIENT: Yeah. [0:24:03.3]
COUNSELOR: I am right, aren't I? Logically.
PATIENT: I guess you are.
COUNSELOR: Logically.
PATIENT: I've got to be (inaudible at 0:24:09.6) But I feel guilty anyway, right?
COUNSELOR: I guess. Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay. So —
COUNSELOR: So how come you feel guilty anyways? What's that about?
PATIENT: That's about my not telling him ever. And it's about the way that I'm with kind of towards (inaudible at 0:24:43.0) And that's (inaudible at 0:24:48.2)
COUNSELOR: Like you have bad feelings but those are (inaudible at 0:24:57.8) from the kinds of problems and feeling you were having about (inaudible at 0:25:03.2) relationship. [0:25:04.1]
PATIENT: And why does he break up with me and want to (inaudible at 0:25:07.1) for whatever obscure reason. I don't know. I think I was maybe insecure. But although I was telling him about — that I wasn't going to accept (inaudible at 0:25:24.5) other people. So (inaudible at 0:25:27.2)
COUNSELOR: It sounds like there's a hangover (inaudible at 0:25:35.6) anger. You angered (inaudible at 0:25:42.0)
PATIENT: Yeah. Well that carried on for a while because even when I said she's living with James temporarily, he goes (inaudible at 0:25:54.6) about you a lot. A lot of my spare time I was thinking about him. (inaudible at 0:26:07.0) [0:26:08.6]
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:26:10.4) you had left him, he hadn't left you. (inaudible at 0:26:25.4) what did you say (inaudible at 0:26:27.2) like there are kind of hangovers (inaudible at 0:26:31.4)
PATIENT: I'm sure that there are. Some of my extreme reactions (inaudible at 0:26:47.8)
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Ways that I had a slight tendency to (inaudible at 0:26:56.0) but wouldn't go oh (inaudible at 0:27:01.8) Oh, I told — I did (inaudible at 0:27:05.9) a long time ago. And I talked about it (inaudible at 0:27:07.7) about we (inaudible at 0:27:09.7) And if he should strongly (inaudible at 0:27:13.8) And I knew that part of it anyway (inaudible at 0:27:21.1) or something because (inaudible at 0:27:26.6) He would say he was going to go out and he would never come back like that. (inaudible at 0:27:38.2)
COUNSELOR: On —
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:27:41.1)
COUNSELOR: Oh. It was like you perceived him as doing that whether it be (inaudible at 0:27:47.0) I know what you mean. Like you blamed on him that he was stowing away and never coming back.
PATIENT: No. (inaudible at 0:27:54.7) I think. (Laughs)
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Drew is the old boyfriend. [0:27:59.1]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And James would actually do that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I thought. Let me tell you what I said (inaudible at 0:28:02.3)
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: When James said I'm going out to play basketball. What you heard in the back of your mind was Drew saying I'm going out and never coming back again.
PATIENT: Oh. Right.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:28:10.5) blamed it on him.
PATIENT: Yes. That's right.
COUNSELOR: Who did you blame what on?
PATIENT: I blamed my reaction to James' words on Drew.
COUNSELOR: That was your reaction (inaudible at 0:28:19.9) Okay.
PATIENT: Okay. And so I was just saying that's a hangover.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. There were like the whole bunch of loose ends like that and like your feeling so (inaudible at 0:28:33.0) treated Drew for the end and also feeling about how angry that you feel with him towards the end. And I don't know what else but it sounds like there were a bunch of things.
PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:28:49.4)
COUNSELOR: Sort of unfinished.
PATIENT: I guess (inaudible at 0:28:54.2) It eventually stopped. [0:29:00.5]
COUNSELOR: Like there's not much really you could do about them but (inaudible at 0:29:06.5)
PATIENT: I guess. I don't know what to do. Because I can't think of specific things really to (inaudible at 0:29:13.7) I know that I felt (inaudible at 0:29:22.1) but I don't know if (inaudible at 0:29:25.5) or not.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:29:27.7)
PATIENT: And I don't know that I still see it effecting my life now except for (inaudible at 0:29:37.6) What if I (inaudible at 0:29:40.5)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If I could —
COUNSELOR: It is dying away (inaudible at 0:29:46.0)
PATIENT: But I still think about well, maybe I should go away with (inaudible at 0:29:53.0)
COUNSELOR: What's that? You're horrified at yourself? [0:30:02.1]
PATIENT: And the laughter.
COUNSELOR: Oh, well. (inaudible at 0:30:10.4) going away with Drew but to Alaska.
PATIENT: Yeah. I feel sorry for him. I feel — yeah, I do. Because you see he was talking like this maybe three years ago. And like now -
COUNSELOR: So this seems pathetic to you?
PATIENT: Sometimes yeah.
COUNSELOR: Like then (inaudible at 0:30:47.2) It sounds like that (inaudible at 0:31:11.9) does something to you. [0:31:13.5]
PATIENT: Well —
COUNSELOR: Like hooks you in or something. Or a question mark; does it -?
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:31:24.0)
COUNSELOR: Well like if you weren't so pathetic then you wouldn't feel like you had to lead him on. That you could say hey, I'm shacked up with James. And that's that.
PATIENT: Maybe. I don't think I can actually live up there. I think I feel that — yeah, I must feel bad in a lot of ways about (inaudible at 0:32:20.6) just thinking of when I first met him, he had only been married I think three years. If that and that was a long time ago. And, he wasn't — he didn't have a real, wonderful home life but it wasn't horrible. But because of me, it got a lot worse. [0:32:46.8]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And now, you know when I left him, it was like it was too late for that marriage really I think. Because whenever I talk to him and he — you know when he hasn't been seeing (inaudible at 0:32:57.7) talking, he was saying it's lousy.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I know that I blame myself for that too.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Like it wasn't that it was great to begin with but it sounds like you really see yourself as having part in a (inaudible at 0:33:12.2) some way or really exacerbated it.
PATIENT: Yeah. And, I did it too. It wasn't that I unconsciously did it.
COUNSELOR: You were aware.
PATIENT: Yes, I was.
COUNSELOR: Like the blood is really on your hand.
PATIENT: Yeah. I think so.
COUNSELOR: And it's damn hard to live with.
PATIENT: Not because of the marriage so much. It's because of him. And I was — he's kind of like an angry, confused person and — [0:33:49.8]
COUNSELOR: You said it.
PATIENT: Yeah. And I feel like if he does get a divorce now which (inaudible at 0:33:56.4) But if he does, he's going to be (inaudible at 0:34:02.0) too. Maybe that's not true. Maybe (inaudible at 0:34:05.7)
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right.
PATIENT: But, that's how I feel. I think I feel pretty bad about that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like you're really — it's almost as if you were responsible for his downfall.
PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:34:29.3)
COUNSELOR: That's what made me uncomfortable. It's not really like I have fault because (inaudible at 0:34:33.5) that way to begin with.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: But it's like we made it so much worse. Like you (inaudible at 0:34:41.7)
PATIENT: Yeah. I really feel like (inaudible at 0:34:44.2) And he does too. And all of the times I believed this (inaudible at 0:34:48.7) And I still might believe this. Like, I may have a very (inaudible at 0:34:57.3) Most of the time, now, we get along very well (inaudible at 0:35:07.8) I was like a baby. Not as if his wife wasn't (inaudible at 0:35:13.3) It was me. [0:35:14.5]
And, he was my baby too. But then I moved to Michigan. It was like the (inaudible at 0:35:27.5) pulled out from under me. When I came back, he never was (inaudible at 0:35:30.4) but I was still his. Maybe I am (inaudible at 0:35:37.4)
COUNSELOR: Like you really depended on him for —
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Something very important.
PATIENT: Even like (inaudible at 0:35:45.1) that kind of thing like (inaudible at 0:35:47.5)
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Or (inaudible at 0:35:51.0)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:35:52.6) like the things that are special, you were into the — and just special, special to him. Like you're the one that really shared that. [0:36:08.2]
PATIENT: Yeah. And he said to me several times (inaudible at 0:36:15.4) And I think that's (inaudible at 0:36:19.7) But before I was thinking (Laughs) I love having him so I was intent. I mean I knew that I was causing trouble at his house. But I didn't care then. Or I wanted to or something.
COUNSELOR: Okay. You sound like that's contradictory or something. I don't know —
PATIENT: Well I think I've - you know it's probably (inaudible at 0:36:48.2)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:36:50.5) Yeah. But before and —
PATIENT: Oh. (inaudible at 0:36:54.3) in the past year, I wasn't trying to cause any trouble at his house at all. In fact I'm sure his wife never knew who he was seeing (inaudible at 0:37:03.7) because I was (inaudible at 0:37:06.4) [0:37:07.9]
COUNSELOR: So what? I mean so is that you shouldn't feel so guilty because —
PATIENT: No. I don't know. Maybe because I was setting him up. I don't know. Because I was still (inaudible at 0:37:22.4)
COUNSELOR: It's like you — you were like one up or something on him.
PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:37:33.3)
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you had — you were solid and he wasn't.
PATIENT: Yeah. Boy, I must have been in love (inaudible at 0:37:43.2)

COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:38:30.7)
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:38:32.2)
COUNSELOR: So (inaudible at 0:38:34.1)
