<b>DR:</b> Hi [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> Hello doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, um, last time I saw you, your mom was coming to visit.
<b>PT:</b> She cannot doctor, oh really.
<b>DR:</b> She cannot.
<b>PT:</b> She cannot.
<b>DR:</b> How come?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, she's she, she cannot, she cannot fly without any companionship.
<b>DR:</b> Well and there's no one to be companion to?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, she cannot because my sister husband had a, a, heart problem that is bothering him and the son has, he's having, uh, chemo for his aneurysm in the head.
<b>DR:</b> You mean the son and the father?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Oh boy.
<b>PT:</b> That's the reason why I, I don't know what to think about myself doctor.  It's kind of hard and I'm still very, very in thinking about those things what is happening to my family is kind of hard for me.
<b>DR:</b> I don't blame you, it's terrible what, so the son has an aneurysm and the father has a bad heart.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yes, he was, he has, um, heart surgery before but now it's bothering him and my mom is old and she cannot —
<b>DR:</b> Well how is you sister handling?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, she's kind of sad the way how she talked to me Tuesday when I called, you know.  And it's kind of hard because she's the only one, she cannot and I don't understand about myself doctor because just like I don't have no interest of doing things like in a couple weeks I went to my doctor and he told me to tell you the truth.  And so I'm telling you.  Because sometimes I know that it's very, very seem to have something to do in your life about God but I'm just think, that's just looking about it but just like I'm kind of sad, very, very sad for what's happening to me.  And I cannot breath sometimes that's not sometimes but mostly all of the time like I doubt, I doubt my heart, like I doubt like what's wrong like, I'm not doing anything wrong, you know, that's the what I'm saying.  And like I want to stay in the hospital and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] when I, but I get sick that time for two weeks and he wants me to go, he, he tells me he wants me to let him, let me stay in the hospital but then I said no, no, no, no and then I told him okay doctor, when I'm going to see [PHYSICIAN NAME] I'm going to tell him.  But he told me to tell you how I'm feeling, what I'm thinking and what's happening but —
<b>DR:</b> Did you want to go to the psychiatric hospital?
<b>PT:</b> No I don't want, no.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> I think —
<b>DR:</b> What hospital do you want to go to?
<b>PT:</b> I just want to stay in [DEIDENTIFIED], like I'm, I'm, I don't know, it's not thinking of, it's the thinking of killing myself but like thinking of, like I'm feeling my body kind of weak.
<b>DR:</b> Well [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] he wanted to put you in and you didn't want to go.
<b>PT:</b> Because I, I said, I'm going to talk to doctor, he told me to talk to you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah but I cannot put you in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> I, I know that.
<b>DR:</b> Only in the psychiatric —
<b>PT:</b> No, no.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> Because I'm agreed that because the only thing is, it's —
<b>DR:</b> Not crazy [PATIENT NAME], depressed.  Are you suicidal?
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to do that, you know, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] sometimes I don't know what to say.  Like I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say.  I just stay in my bed all day, all night.  Up there I took shower, I come to over here and then I, I go home, you know, and then I just —
<b>DR:</b> Went to Burger King?
<b>PT:</b> Yes just to eat the, the French fries, you know, doctor and then I'm just thinking I don't know what I'm thinking doctor.  Sometimes I'm staring.
<b>DR:</b> Well how, how is it at your house, how's your, your niece doing?
<b>PT:</b> Well she, [INAUDIBLE] they are very, very good, ah, ah, family.
<b>DR:</b> So your sister—in—law is okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And there are, but I don't want, I don't want them to know.  I don't want them to know.
<b>DR:</b> Well [PATIENT NAME] they lost their father, they lost their husband.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want them to know that.
<b>DR:</b> But they're getting better, they're doing better.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know why —
<b>DR:</b> And, and, and yet you're not doing better.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know what's happening to me.

<b>PT:</b> I'm thinking every single day and night, I cry.
<b>DR:</b> Okay well I have a new medicine I want you to add.  The one that, it's a helper medicine to help the medicines that you're taking because your medicines need some help.  Before they were working good but now they're not working so good anymore.  Um, because people they go through grief if they lose a loved one but then they recover.  But you went through grief and you never recovered.
<b>PT:</b> I know doctor, I know, I don't know what's wrong with me or maybe wanting somebody [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> No you have depression, that's what's wrong with you, you have depression and you know the, the depression takes control, you know, takes over.  So we —
<b>PT:</b> It's like —
<b>DR:</b> Need to give you medicine to get rid of the depression.
<b>PT:</b> Just like I don't have no interest of, of life.  What I want to eat is, I don't like, just like I just want to eat French fries, that's it, that's it doctor.  And then like, I'm so, how come I'm so sad, how come I just want to, just like I don't even want to go out to the living room.  I go out but even for a while and then my sister—in—law said, what's, what you going to do again and then I said, I am going to lay down.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah because you're depressed.  Depressed people they withdraw like a wounded animal, they don't, they go into their den and they wait until their, until they get better or until they die.
<b>PT:</b> Do you mean to say I die if I —
<b>DR:</b> No we have to get you better.  We have to give you the new medicine.
<b>PT:</b> Okay doctor.  Um —
