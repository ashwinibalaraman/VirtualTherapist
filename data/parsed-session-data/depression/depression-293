<b>DR:</b> Tell me [PATIENT NAME] how you've been doing.
<b>PT:</b> I haven't been doing so good lately.  I was at first and then I just, I'll see something about a baby or I'll see something that I should've been doing and I'm not doing or I'm not capable of doing and I just.  That plus my energy and my lack of, I just feel worthless that I can't do like how I use to do.  I can't provide for my son, I can't participate at school functions, when, when school was going on I missed a lot of stuff.  I just wasn't in the mood of going and I stopped doing a lot of things that I use to do every day, walking, exercising, dancing, I don't even do that now.
<b>DR:</b> So you've been still dealing with depression.  How long now you say?
<b>PT:</b> Hm, it started probably back in three years ago, but this is the me, the first time I ever started getting treatment for it.  I never got treatment for it and I don't, I don't know what it would take for me to get better.  Sometimes I think about doing crazy things to myself.
<b>DR:</b> Like what?
<b>PT:</b> Just taking myself out, it, I mean if I had somebody to really take care of my son, uh, or at least love him as much as I would, I probably would do it.  The things and the way I do could do it, I'm always struggling with him.  [CRYING].  Since he was born [INAUDIBLE].  He, he was premature.  He came, he was seven months, two months early.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And then after that he got, he was sick.  His father wasn't there and I always take care of him since he been born and now I can't do it.  I can't do nothing for him right now, nothing, I can't.  Sometimes I don't even want to talk to him or be around him.  And he told me that the other day he said "Ma you act like you don't want me no more."  I don't know why I act like that towards him though, but I don't.  I'm just not able to do like I use to for him and myself.  I can't, I, I al, I always been the one to, to do, you know, I always been the one to take care of him and myself.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Even when I was married I didn't have the help like I was suppose to with him and now it's getting worse and worse.  I don't know what else to do.  I started to let him go stay at my mama's for a while, but I, if I do that then I know I probably do something crazy because he's the only reason why I never done anything crazy yet.  The only reason why is my son.
<b>DR:</b> He keeps you going, huh?
<b>PT:</b> [CRYING].  He, he, he keeps me going he really do, he really do.
<b>DR:</b> So you used to be pretty active, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Started out with the pain and now it's —
<b>PT:</b> It, it's a de —
<b>DR:</b> A depression, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just don't want to do nothing no more.  I just give up.
<b>DR:</b> But you've been on, like, before you came to me your family doctor did put you on antidepressants, right —
<b>PT:</b> Mm, yeah.  [COUGHING] —
<b>DR:</b> How long have you been on it though?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I'm not sure, I'm not sure.
<b>DR:</b> All right, it doesn't seem to be doing much is it?
<b>PT:</b> S, s, sometimes, I don't know.  I just don't know anymore.  Some days I'll be in a good mood, some days I'm not.  You know, some days I can call up, you know, my sister, I can talk to, with her some days I can't do, I don't even answer the phone at all.
<b>DR:</b> You're not going to church or nothing —
<b>PT:</b> No I'm going to —
<b>DR:</b> Used to be, right?
<b>PT:</b> I used to go to church every Sunday, every Sunday.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> But now lately I haven't been going to church, my son go to church and they have things going on, functions going on and I'd never been to one of them yet.  It is embarrassing, it is.  It hurts me so bad that I can't do for my own child like I use to.
<b>DR:</b> Mm.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm about to go crazy over it.  Either that or I'm going to have to do something, I might have to let him go stay at my mama or my sisters, somebody.  Because I hate to just flip out and do something crazy and hurt him or hurt myself and he see it.  [CRYING].  I never been like this before, not like this.  Sometimes I try and sometimes I don't even try.  I just give up.  I don't even get out of bed sometimes, some mornings I don't even get out the bed and I forget that he's not home, like.  Things I use to remember I don't remember now.  I don't.
<b>DR:</b> Been crying a lot even, or is it because you're crying, you're talking about it right now is that making you cry —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah —
<b>DR:</b> Or you are like this even at home?
<b>PT:</b> When I think about things I start crying like this all the time.  I try not to do it in front of my son, but sometimes it happens.  Most of the time I stay in the room, I lock the door.  And sometimes he doesn't see me all day long, I'll be in the room and then, I know that's not right.  He's going through emotional stuff too just like I am.  And right now he's really thinking that I don't want him or I don't want to be around him or I don't want to talk to him because I do act like that towards him.  Then he's doing so good in school, but I can't do nothing for him.  I can't even go see him to perform or accept an award, I can't.
<b>DR:</b> You don't like to be around people?
<b>PT:</b> I don't like to be around people, just, like right now if it, if I wasn't coming to the doctor, I wouldn't even come out the house.  There's some times I have to make myself to get up and do it and I miss doctor appointments because I forget about it, you know, for, I forget about them.
<b>DR:</b> How is your sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Only time I can sleep is when I take my medication.  If I don't take my medication I stay up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.  Sometimes later than that, sometimes later than that, I don't get no sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Is there any family history of depression or no?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, only thing I know, my brother has it, one of my brothers that's it.  Just my life just seems worthless now, like, I did, it's not the same.  I think about things that I need to do and should be do, but I'm not doing it.  I can't do it.  I try to do it sometimes, but I can't.  So I don't know what else to do doctor, I don't know what else, I don't know what else to do.  I'm trying to get help, but, but I can't and I don't want to turn to doing something, you know, illegal or something like that to, you know, to get myself.  I don't know what to do now.  I, I really am confused, I can't think and social, like, how I want to, you know, like how I used to.
<b>DR:</b> What do you mean illegal?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know what else to do.
<b>DR:</b> Illegal in what sense, what you worried about?
<b>PT:</b> I'm not worried about nothing, I don't know what the problem is I just —
<b>DR:</b> Is the comment doing drugs or something?
<b>PT:</b> No, but I'm just —
<b>DR:</b> I hope not.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know what they give me that, I need some, something to give me that energy, that boost, that, that, that —
<b>DR:</b> Oh —
<b>PT:</b> That positive attitude I had one time.  I don't have it no more.  My attitude was, my self esteem is gone when I had it up here because I would always take care of my son and provide for him, but I can't, I can't do it.  I can't, I really can't.  [CRYING].  He just said remember the time I worked at [DEIDENTIFIED] [INAUDIBLE] and tell him I'm going to get him and pick him up, but I didn't do it.
<b>DR:</b> You are seriously thinking about killing yourself or anything?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I, I think about it.
<b>DR:</b> What's the, what, have you been trying or?
<b>PT:</b> I never tried it.
<b>DR:</b> How would you do it?
<b>PT:</b> The quickest way is probably cut my wrist or either take a whole bottle of pills, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> And the only thing that stops you is what?  Your son?
<b>PT:</b> My son because I know he, [CRYING], I know he needs me and if I do that he won't have me.  He won't and he don't want to have to go through what I do, nobody going to take care of him like I do.
<b>DR:</b> Good the main reason you feel that is because you can't kind of provide for your he, son like you used to, cannot give him time like you used to —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum —
<b>DR:</b> And it's lots to do with the depression and the pain.
<b>PT:</b> Yes ma'am —
<b>DR:</b> All right —
<b>PT:</b> But I can't do it.
<b>DR:</b> Well let me explain to you.  We are addressing you depression, we will try to give you something hopefully that will work just right and you will start feeling better.  Now the pain you already have taking, you are trying to take care of it —
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] —
<b>DR:</b> Just like your carpal tunnel —
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yes —
<b>DR:</b> You have been operated on recently so that's good.  For a backache of course, you know —
<b>PT:</b> My back, they , I don't know whether I'm going to have to have surgery on my shoulder or my back because they haven't even did my nerve test on that yet.  They just did it on my hands so I still got some more to go through —
<b>DR:</b> I understand —
<b>PT:</b> I'm still living with, in, in pain and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> I understand that.  So co, what I'm trying to tell you that, yes it's not rare.  Yes it is bad for you and how old are you now?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> [AGE] you're very young and you have a 60 more years in front of you and you want to have some understanding, you're in pain, you have the, your presentably depressed, you were an independent woman at one time.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You took a pride and taking care of yourself and your children and taking care of you, you have a good work track record.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, so far you have done well except for this injury that probably doing work you [INAUDIBLE] whatever and that's not good, but it's there and thank God for medicine that we are trying to get something done.  Surgically they're going to correct hopefully with your carpal tunnel so that leaves you with feeling a little better.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Back ache, you, you've not been even address so maybe you, who knows?  They might be able to address your back problem and there may be something that can be done, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> All these things only can be done if you are alive, you have a chance, right?  If you go six foot under you lost all the chances of getting better.  Are you with me?  Are you with me?  Does that make any sense?  Yes?  Do we have night, every night is a dark night?  Doesn't the sun follow that?  You have rainy days every day?  Don't feel bright sunshiny days afterwards, but then we have a dark night, and think "Oh my God look at that it's so dark."  And we cannot think about the sun that time can we?  But the sun comes up, right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And you have, I mean you've done such a good job of raising your son.  He's getting the awards so, so you are contributing some for this nice young man who can be, you, before you know it he'll be a nice young responsible man.  So you want to survive, you want to do the best you can.  You may think you're not a good mom, ask him.  Think about yourself, would you want your life without your mom?  Don't you think "Oh my, my mom can take care of my son now and I'm going to leave me son with her."  So don't you want to be a dependable mom like you are having, you are thinking about?  Your mom, your sister, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And I know it's a, when you are in pain, when you don't see any doors open, you just have to keep on praying, there will be some place left for you at the end of the road they'll be looking up for you.  Just, but you only have those, those chances if you are alive.  Right?  Running away from problem is a cowardly up living, is it?  This, is not that selfish when you are thinking about "Oh I'm going to kill myself or die and my son can be taken care of by."  It's a good thought, but it, really think about it.  You're running away from problem aren't you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Is that being fair for him?
<b>PT:</b> No.  [CRYING].
<b>DR:</b> Right?  And I know I, not, not fair, but everybody don't get a fair deal in life.  Easy for me to say, I'm sure you are in pain.  You are suffering and you are not doing good.  That's totally understandable.  That's why people like us try to help you with medicine, try to give you some hopes, maybe I'll, I'll have you, did you talk to my counselor here or no?
<b>PT:</b> Um, no.
<b>DR:</b> I'm going to refer you to her.  Come and talk to her, okay?  It will help, okay?  You only have chance of going on with your life if you stay six foot above.  Once you go down, I don't come down to help you do I?  Nobody does do they —
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> That's gone.
<b>PT:</b> But sometimes it just gets to the point at where you just give up.
<b>DR:</b> I know —
<b>PT:</b> [CRYING] —
<b>DR:</b> I understand that, I mean I'm not saying don't feel bad and, um, you should feel bad.  Yes, you are in pain.  Yes you should feel you are not what you use to do, but think about what you have so you don't have, we understand.  You are in pain?  Yes.  You are not able to work?  Yes.  That's bad.  There are so, still many things you have, you have a lot of love in your heart for your son, that's not killed yet is it?
<b>PT:</b> Not yet no.  [CRYING].
<b>DR:</b> Right?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So you have lots of good things in you, you know?  Good Lord has provided you with two eyes, two legs, you are still able to walk, you are still able to remember you are in pain, you're still able to use your hands.  There are lots of things, go, look at the people who are worse off than you are.  And then you going to appreciate your problem, but otherwise suicide is a cowardly, of running away from problem.  I hate to say that word, but that's the fact I'm telling you right now.  I've been in this practice for 35 y, 30 years maybe, a little over 30 years.  Longer than you've been on this earth.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  But I'm telling you, you know, I have seen people who have committed suicide.  I have, in my practice.  Yes.  I have seen their families after they kill them self, I have seen the families whose, you know, both mom, dad, husbands have and you don't want to know what a pain and agony and guilt they live through.  So yeah I, you may check out from this world and for you maybe problem is ended, but that, you don't know the second generation of problem begins which may be worse.  Are you with me?  Huh?  Your son is doing good, [AGE], got awards, he's doing good in school.  So those are the positive things, concentrate on that.  Feel good about it.  How many single parents would have done a good of a job like you thought you have done so you don't see what you have done.  You're just looking at what you can't and it's not by choice you are doing it.  It's not like you are turning to drugs and alcohol and doing all —
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You're not ruining your life it's, it's just a, it's unfortunate thing that happened to you.
<b>PT:</b> [CRYING].
<b>DR:</b> It's okay to cry about it, it's okay to get mad about it.
<b>PT:</b> [CRYING].
<b>DR:</b> But I'm checking out from this world, come on.  We can do better than that.  Don't you think —
<b>PT:</b> Well I ask myself why?
<b>DR:</b> But, you know?
<b>PT:</b> I always been a good child, I always been good person, always been, you know?
<b>DR:</b> I know.
<b>PT:</b> [CRYING].
<b>DR:</b> But we, you, the, the big question why, I know things happen.  Once we accept, now he said to me once we accept this is how it is, the next step you will deal with it.  It's not going to change, your backache is not going to go away.  Your hands, now they're carpal tunnel, they are operating on you hopefully that will get a little better.  Why things happen?  There is no answer.  Nobody yet has been able to figure out why things happen.  Why —
<b>PT:</b> Good people —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah things happens to good people, nobody has yet been able to figure it out.  But when we compromise and when we accept that this is the way it is, I have to deal with it.  Yes I'm not able to do this, yes I'm not able to look at my son, you know, he's, he, he can always look back, even though you may not think that you are not useful, ask him how much he feels secure that his mom is there.  That security has million dollar worth.  Just mere fact that you are there is a lot.  Ask him.  It's okay, you don't have to be running tag with him and chase with him and play tennis with him  It's okay.  If you are not able to do it that's okay.  When he plays tennis you can go sit and cheer him up, you can do that with him out.  Can you not with your expression.  When he gets an award you can go and sit whenever it's possible.  Are you, okay we're not able to go running forever, when he came home I'm sure you put your arms around him and said "I'm proud of you."  That means a lot to him than a million, million other people could be telling him how good he is.  The approval that mom and dad can give, nobody can.  Trust me.  I've been in this business for a long to tell you this.  So really when you are thinking of suicide it's not all, no good to him that "I'm going to check out."  You are still thinking selfishly and I hate to tell you this, you are selfish [INAUDIBLE] you want to run away from problem, no.  Be there so when they [INAUDIBLE] evaluate your back, maybe they'll give you some back medicine for your pain.  You are applying for Social Security, hopefully that will go through.  You will able to support him and give him your moral support if not physical.  Right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah —
<b>DR:</b> So are, are we going to think like that?
<b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.
<b>DR:</b> And anyway gets really bad, okay.  I'm going to refer you to my counselor.
