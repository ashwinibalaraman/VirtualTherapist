<b>DR:</b>	Hi, [PATIENT NAME], how are you feeling?
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  It's, uh, I don't know to be honest.  I don't.
<b>DR:</b>	How are you sleeping?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't sleep.  Um, last night, I got maybe two hours sleep last night.  I've, you know, I've, I've tried taking, um, Tylenol PM and stuff, and it didn't work.
<b>DR:</b>	So the depression is not getting better?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  No, it's not.  It's just getting worse.  I'm getting worse.  I thought that I could deal it, but I can't.  You know, I, I came in last year and seen you and after that, I, I didn't feel like I was ready to talk to anybody yet, and then since then, it's just gotten a whole lot worse, a whole lot worse.
<b>DR:</b>	And this goes back when you had a wreck?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Tell me about it.
<b>PT:</b>	[DATE] you know, we had a wreck, and my [AGE] brother was killed in that wreck, and, um, my ankle was crushed, and my Dad was disabled and everything, and, um, since then I've kind of put it, you know, off and I haven't cried or anything about it since the funeral, and I do think about it.  I can smell the brakes.  I can smell, you know, the radiator fluid.  I can smell everything from that day.  It plays over in my mind every night when I try to lay down and go to sleep, and here lately it's been where I just, I don't want to do anything at all.  I don't want to play with my kids.  I don't want to do my housework.  I don't want to go out.  I just want to lay down and stay there.
<b>DR:</b>	How about your crying spells?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, um, my nerves get so bad with my kids, and having everything else on me, I just, I just, I cry.  I have to go to another room and just cry and sometimes I do it in front of my kids, and they don't understand, you know.  They're small and they don't understand why I'm like this, and I feel like it's causing a problem with me and my oldest son because he, he's gotten to where he just don't want to, you know, be around me as much.  He wants to be with my Mom, which he's close to her, and that's fine.  He always has been, but it just seems like, I don't know.  He's, I really don't know, I don't, but me crying, it's just so stressed.  It, it feels like, um, when I do cry, when I do scream or holler, it's, my stress goes down some, but then it just makes everything worse, and it makes everybody not want to be around me, you know.  So, I mean it's caused a lot of problems with relationships with me and family and friends and stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	Any suicidal feelings you have?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't, no.  I don't feel like, you know, killing myself or, or hurting myself in any way.  I don't feel like that.  I just have so much on my mind that I think about, you know, and, but I've, I've never thought about doing that, no.  I've never thought about, you know, hurting others or, or nothing.  I just, I feel like I've got the world on me, on top of me.  I feel like it's killing me from the inside out, you know.  I feel like I'm dead on the inside sometimes, and I hate feeling this way.  I want to get back to the way I was, you know.  I got up every morning, and I slept at night.  I done what I needed to do during the day.  I played with my kids.  I was, you know, most people would say normal.
<b>DR:</b>	When was this?
<b>PT:</b>	This was before the wreck, before the wreck.  So, and I haven't, I haven't been that way in a very long time, and there's some days, you know, I have my good days to where I can get up and do what I need to do and be fine and, you know, and not scream and yell and be, you know, just tore up, my nerves tore up with the kids and everything gets to me.  I can actually get up sometimes and I'll be fine, but here lately, it's gotten to where I haven't had one of those good days in a long time, you know, and I'm, I'm worried.  I really am cause I don't want to, I know I'm going downhill, but I don't want to get so far gone to where I can't fix it, you know, cause my kids, my kids are all, uh, all I have, and I have family, but, you know, and I'm all that they have.  You know, I'm doing it by myself, and so I need to do something to fix this.
<b>DR:</b>	You're not working, right?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  No, when I had [NAME OTHER] which is my youngest, he's [AGE] I was working at a daycare, and, um, he had, uh, he was three months premature, and so he came home on oxygen and monitor and he wasn't able to go to daycare, so I had to quit working to take care of him, and he actually wasn't released from, um, the preemie doctor, from under her care, until maybe a month ago.  So, in the past month or so, I've been looking for a job, and I just haven't had any luck at all.  You know, I've thought about maybe if I just, you know, got out of the house and, um, got a job that, you know, it would help out a lot me not just being stuck at the house and surrounded by everything cause where I live is, um, my and my little brother lived, you know, together, and so that makes it bad too cause I could leave the house, and I'll be fine, and you know, I still have all those worries on my mind, and I still can't sleep if I stay like over at my brother's for the night or whatever, but it's not as bad as when I come back to that house, you know, and I hate where I live to begin because there's so many people around there that are just, you know, bad people, and I, I don't like it at all staying there, and it gets worse every day over there seems like.
<b>DR:</b>	It's like the project, the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	No, it's over in, um, near the [DEIDENTIFIED] and there's a lot of drugs, a lot of people that are on drugs and prostitutes and stuff that.  You know, there's a lot of crack over there, and a lot of people, you know, doing it, and you will see em come up, I'm scared to take my kids outside.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and I let em, I let em play as long as I'm out there with them, but, you know, I have so much to do inside the house because of having three kids, you know, they don't get to go out as much as they would like to, and so that's why, you know, [NAME OTHER] goes up to Mom's.
<b>DR:</b>	How old is your oldest one?
<b>PT:</b>	[AGE], he'll be [AGE] in November.  Him and I, we used to be, you know, closer than what we are now.
<b>DR:</b>	So, you had him when you were like [AGE]?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  When we had the wreck, he was like [AGE].  And then, you know, I lost a bunch of time with him after that.  I missed him walking, and missed, I mean I missed a lot after that because, you know, after the wreck, I wasn't able to take care of him.  I wasn't barely able to take care of myself after the wreck.  I couldn't walk for months, and, um, I couldn't even get in and out of the tub.  I'd have to have somebody to help me, and so I wasn't able to do that, and a friend from church, my Mom's friend, well, it was actually family, but through marriage, they, um, took care of him until I was able to start walking again and able to do for him like I should, and I, I think, you know, they say that those months and stuff are the bonding, you know, between a mother and a child and I think that had a lot of, you know, impact on me and him, but we were close, and it's just, it's went away.  I have a lot of trouble with him, I do.
<b>DR:</b>	Now, he was the one who was molested, right, by—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, by my Dad.  My Dad still denies that and I know what I seen, and I know what I heard, and, you know, he, he didn't get any time from it.  I went and dropped the charges on it, and, um, I, I couldn't, they wanted me to go into court and put my Dad away for fifteen years, and I couldn't do it.  I mean I, I, I love my Dad and I, and I, the whole point of doing all that is protecting my son, and which to this day I'm still doing, you know, even though he's out.  He has not come around, you know.  I don't, I don't want anything to do with him, and he is not to be around my kids at all, um, but I couldn't see putting him in jail for fifteen years, you know.  I just, I couldn't, but he still calls and tries to, um, talk to me and tell me that, you know, it wasn't what I thought it was, and that it didn't happen, and I told him, you know, to kiss my, that I know what I seen, and, you know, for him not to call me anymore.  And me and my Dad, that was really the only person that I could talk to, you know, because I was close to him from the time I was born up until that happened.  I was so close to him.  He was, he was everything to me.
<b>DR:</b>	Aw.
<b>PT:</b>	He was.  I'm just tired.  I'm tired of trying to pretend that everything's okay cause it's not convincing anybody else, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	There's a lot of burden you've been carrying on you, aren't you?  Where is the Mama in this picture?
<b>PT:</b>	She, says, you know, when my little brother, even before then we never had a good relationship at all.  I always felt like she hated me, always.  I can never remember her playing with me when I was little.  The only thing I can remember is, you know, her being mean to me and my Dad stepping in and saying, you know, that's enough.  And I guess that's why I was so close to my Dad, and even now, even it's almost like she helps me out, and I love her.  She helps me out, but I think she does it because she feels guilty, you know, and I've always, I'm the middle and she's always treated my older brother and my little brother, who got killed, you know, she's, she's always treated them like they were way up here, and I'm down here.  She treated me like crap, and I've tried to talk to her about it, and she don't want to hear it, you know.  But she's more concerned with herself even, she's always been this way.  She's always been more concerned with herself than anybody else, than anybody else, and I know that, you know, you need to take care of yourself, and things like that, but she's, she don't care and you can tell she, she, she just don't care.  It's like, you know, I've been telling her that I need to go talk to somebody, and she says yeah, you need to go to talk to somebody and then she just, she just, it's like if it ain't helping her in any kind of way, she don't, really don't care, and I hate to feel that way about her.  And I love her, I do, and ever since my little brother got killed, I tried my best to have the closest relationship possible with her just because if something did happen to her or me, I didn't want it to, to, you know, go on bad terms, you know, and but it's so hard.  I mean I know I'm hard to get along with, but I just don't know why she has to be that way.  If it ain't helping [NAME OTHER], then she don't care.  That's, you know, that's her and my Dad would fight all the time when I was little, all the time, and she blames it on him, and he blames it on her, and I really don't care, you know.  I'm just, I was glad that my little brother didn't have to see what I did, and then now, you know, he's gone.  So, and my Dad, I think he is crazy since all that happened to my little brother, and then that happening with [NAME OTHER] it's been hard.  It really has cause I was so close to him, and then, you know, having Mom, who I've wanted to talk to so many times, but I didn't want to upset her, you know.  And I really don't like talking to her.  I've never, when I was, you know, young and I started my monthly, you know, and I didn't go to my Mom like most girls do.  I went to my Dad, you know.  That's just the way it's always been.  I've always went to my Dad.
<b>DR:</b>	So you lost a lot?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Lost your brother, lost your best friend, your father, enough to make you depressed.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
