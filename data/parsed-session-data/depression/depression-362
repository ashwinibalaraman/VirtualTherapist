BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: And congratulations on your MVP.
CLIENT: (laughs) That was actually more of—that was actually in its own way much more of a prize because—um—I didn't feel like I did that much, but to be voted—it's one of those things where everybody voted for who did the most during tax—like made the biggest contribution to the store for tax free.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And coming in second place actually is a big deal to me, because I don't feel like I did much of anything, really, other than what I normally do.
THERAPIST: Gotcha.
CLIENT: So to me it was much more of a—it's more of a kudos than the actual—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —you know, stuff. So –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: And the people—the person who did win it was actually a part of the inventory people, so like, in terms of being at radio (ph) and get products like immediately, I totally am like—there's no animosity about not winning that MBA (ph)—
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: —just because I feel like—I've made jokes about flying on roller skates.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Because every—moving things around so fast.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:00:50].0
CLIENT: So.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Good for you.
CLIENT: Yeah, so—um –
THERAPIST: It's good to have something go well. 
CLIENT: Yeah. It's—like I said, I know that they had sent a bunch of like product, like samples, to hand out for these kind of things, blah, blah, blah. But to me—and maybe it's just because I'm—I'm more of above that kind of stuff. If—if I needed it, it would be great. But like I'm more above the idea of stuff, really. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It's more of a—a fact that my—that my colleagues felt as if I was really valuable to them.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
CLIENT: Yeah, so—which is really nice because when there are events like tax free or a launch or something like that, I really make—I do a lot in personal preparation to make sure that I give everything that I have while in the store.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And um—and I have a blast the whole time I'm doing it.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I end up paying the price before and after.
THERAPIST: In terms of your health? [00:01:49].1
CLIENT: Health. Emotional-like. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: To the point that it—it's exhausting. Um—that kind of stuff. Um –
THERAPIST: It was just inundated over tax free?
CLIENT: Yeah. Because of the fact that you're used to saying the same things over and over again for 12, 14 hours. When you come home, your problem-solving skills are not always so great because you've been like on this one-way track so long –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —that doing things that are different is like, "Yeah, um, I just put the milk in the—in—in the cupboard and the cereal in the fridge," kind of thing (laughs).
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Gotcha.
CLIENT: So...
THERAPIST: You're fried.
CLIENT: But uh—
THERAPIST: Yeah, we'd actually been talking about it a lot (inaudible) making you go cry about yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: (inaudible) something like that.
CLIENT: Yeah, something like that. So but it—it was nice. But um—I do realize—it's funny, because as I was coming out here, I realized how much—um—the weather really does affect like my mood a lot. Um—I do much better, not just in terms of my health, but in general, just my mood is better when the sun is shining.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:03:00].5
CLIENT: You know? I feel like today that—you know, I am in general—um—even if I'm in pain, I seem to—because today I've been limping around –
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: —um—I seem to do much better than if I'm not. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know? That—then—sorry. Then if it's not.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's fine. I know what...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
CLIENT: Yeah, so—and um—it's frustrating because I—I—I have tried tricking myself by buying like—I—I own like one of those whole spectrum lights, you can look at all of them. It doesn't seem to really work. I mean, it does work if I'm traveling abroad, or if I'm changing time zones, it does help. But it doesn't really help that much with my mood, you know? It's more of a—you know, it's—it's—it—you know, I am very—unfortunately, I am very environment-centric.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:03:55].3
CLIENT: I don't do well in—like, for example, if a place if—if I'm trying to study or do something in a place that's a mess, again, it's just something that's very difficult for me to do.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Um—you know? It's very hard for me to want to do (inaudible) when it's about my day (ph), that kind of stuff. I mean, I'm saying it's probably a universal to all humans everywhere, I would think, except for my mom, who doesn't like bright light, but, you know, that's just her.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But like it—you know, it's nice though. And I'm—I'm really happy that it's—it's pretty good. I uh—I think it's going to help me. I had a really hard time getting out of bed this morning. In fact, I didn't get out of bed until after noon today, so... 
THERAPIST: Well, Wednesday you can really sleep in late, can't you?
CLIENT: Yeah. So—but I didn't think that—I didn't think it was going to become a danger to this appointment –
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: —(laughs) to be scared awake at 1:00 AM—at 1:00 PM, which was—still wasn't a danger for making the appointment –
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: —but I didn't think I'd sleep that late.
THERAPIST: Right. [00:04:51].8
CLIENT: I've never set an alarm for an afternoon appointment.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Unless there's some real reason, like, you know, I've been working all night or something.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So that was kind of startling to me. It's—but um—so that's sort of what's been going on with that. I've been trying to—I don't know just keep going, I guess, is probably the best way to explain it, but just—it's been—I just hate my life. It's very boring, you know? Um—the high points of excitingness in my life that are—make me happy or excited are the most silly, mundane things in the world. Or they're like completely out—like it seems like I feel like I live my life to way too many extremes. And it drives me bonkers. Things like, you know—I'm trying to think of something really simple that made me really happy. (pause) I can't think of anything to save my life right now, but something really, really simple, and then the whole—I go, "Ok." Then I have to go to the other extreme of, "Ok, well I need to plan a trip or something," you know? It's never something like in the middle.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:06:06].3
CLIENT: And I just—I—(pause) it's sort of a weird thing because as much as I say I hate living the extreme life, at the same time I know that I tend to preference towards it, you know? Um—the—use the example that I was talking about, the colleague –
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: —versus the fact that I'd rather live on ramen for most of the month and then go out to a fantastic restaurant –
THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. 
CLIENT: —then go out to like T.G.I. Friday's every weekend, or something like that, you know?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And so—cuz I—I would rather just, you know, live on the ver—very basics and then, you know, have something really great.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And that tends to—but as much as I say that—and say that, at the same time, it's like, "Well, you know, there has to be some middle ground on that," I would think. (pause) I just want to make things count, you know? Um—
THERAPIST: It's nice when things are really quite special.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think if they're memorable at the very least.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:07:24].4
CLIENT: I um—I have been encouraged by people that I know to try and do a sort of Canada trip or something, and I look at the pricing for like doing something in Canada, and I think to myself, "Why not just wait and leave the continent?" It doesn't seem that much different. And—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 
CLIENT: —I just feel like, you know, staying in a place in Toronto when I could stay in, you know—in the center of Paris for an extra $75 more to me seems like a silly—per night, you know?
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It seems like a really silly thing to do, you know? And at the same time, though, putting it off until I'm completely drained so I can do it doesn't always seem the most productive either, you know? So I feel very much like I'm stuck with decision-making. Um—but I really feel like I do need some time off and I need to get out of the city because I am one of those people that will find—I've really found the city probably out of the country (ph) just so I can stay away from trying to do the mundane things that I always end up doing. You know? And things I need to do. Things I absolutely need to do. And I unfortunately learned it from my family, who, you know, if (inaudible) can't sleep, he gets up and works, you know?
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:08:45].0
CLIENT: If my dad can't sleep, he gets up and works, you know? And luckily I can't do that myself, usually. But for him he almost always has something that he can—as long as he has a pad of paper, he can write. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And so um—and then transcribe it later or have somebody transcribe it later. But it's something that is a habit of my own that I just—I have—way too many—it's just too easy for me, so—to fall into that. (pause) But I did call somebody who I knew from back in Cincinnati who no longer is with Microsoft last night. And it wasn't a totally negative experience, but it wasn't totally a positive one. I'm glad that I did it, though. 
THERAPIST: Call to just say, "Hello," you mean? [00:09:38].3
CLIENT: Sort of. I mostly told him—I was mostly giving him a heads-up that if he wanted to get some sort of—he was mistreated in certain ways—that there—there was sort of an avenue for him to potentially get rectified for that, you know, because um—some bad press that Cincinnati's had for the ways that they have fired people.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So he was a—they could not get rid of him due to FMLA.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So they sort of invented not really misconduct, but incompetence write-ups, to get rid of him. 
THERAPIST: Why did they want to get rid of him?
CLIENT: Uh, cuz he was out a lot because his daughter had cystic fibrosis. 
THERAPIST: Hmmm.
CLIENT: Yeah, his like six-week or six-month-old daughter, or whatever.
THERAPIST: Oh, Jesus.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That's awful. [00:10:31].0
CLIENT: Yeah. He was out a lot. 
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And it drove him crazy because sometimes whenever she had to go to the hospital, he had to drop everything and leave.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: And so I know that then they—for a mistake that other people would not be fired for, they fired him for that.
THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.
CLIENT: And so, I just wanted to sort of let him know that if he felt like he wanted to potentially um—either get retribution or get some sort of compensation for it, that there's right now some—some avenues because of some misconduct that Cincinnati's done recently. And we then just sort of talked about the old times, about things.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And um—we were discussing the fact that, quite frankly, some of the things that were the best times about work were the things that really would probably be in a scandal about Cincinnati—(laughs)—something close. But it wasn't something necessarily as bad as you'd think it was, it just—it—it's not like to company policy. So, you know, that kind of stuff. Um—and things that would never be allowed anymore, like um –
THERAPIST: (inaudible) [00:11:35].6
CLIENT: Yeah, so like—like—like a few years ago when all of us were staffed over a long holiday weekend, somebody brought a grill and conveniently—this was a store that wasn't at the mall. It was in a store front.
THERAPIST: Right. Like a stand-alone.
CLIENT: And there was like a—there was an alley behind it and they—you know, somebody actually moved their grill into the back alley. And so, when you were on break, you could go and throw a few hot dogs on the grill, and you know –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —and sit outside. You're not really supposed to be doing this.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Um—and in theory, like there was huge code violations, and this and that. But it was there for like a day. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But it was a way of making everything more pleasant for having to work a long holiday weekend.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Things like that. And the—all the things that were really happy times were all things that were—would be considered kind of scandalous-ish.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But they were, you know? They were good times, you know?
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 
CLIENT: And um—but I realize that there are some people that are out there that are so much more bitter than me. Um—especially in terms of the way they were treated for health.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:12:31].7
CLIENT: But um—it's kind of sad. We had quite a few people that had some really, really severe health problems, and they found—and it was just—there was one really jerky manager who found ways to get rid of people, you know?
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And um—he sort of tortured me, too, emotionally. And that's another reason why I have a lot of self-esteem issues is cuz he would say some pretty horrible things about me. He more or less started the, "Debra is an idiot savant," like thing.
THERAPIST: Oh gosh. 
CLIENT: Yes. You know? Um—
THERAPIST: That's terrible.
CLIENT: Yeah. Or he would say things like you—you had given me advice like, "You need to figure out how to use smaller words when you're talking, because it sounds like you're trying to impress people." And I said, "Well, I'm not really being genuine." And I have sort of an—an—integrated specifically on an effort to do this, to become—to start using phrases, and you know, idioms, that are younger and not nearly as cerebral, I suppose? But I always felt completely fake while doing it, you know? So—and at—and the thing that just made me really frustrated is because of the fact that I am just a bombastic speaker by nature.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:13:56].3
CLIENT: Um—and (laughs) it was so weird. Um—and the core of it is actually, you know, in its own way, is part of my sense of humor about saying things like that—um—you know, (pause)—and it just—it—it—it—it did a lot to really—at a period of time where I was already feeling crappy because my husband was acting out a lot, usually knocked me down. He didn't know what was going on, but he definitely saw that there was a weakness, and that—would give me a hard time about it.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Like pretty much a bully?
CLIENT: Yeah. And he did it in a way that made it sound an awful lot like he was being my friend, which was even worse.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:14:38].3
CLIENT: But um—I had to look up like pop culture references. Apparently there's this movie called, I guess, Rudy or something like that, about a kid who was like mentally deficient, who—he—had his of playing football. But really he wasn't ever a good football player anyways and it was charity.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And that kind of thing. I'm like are—are you really honestly making like—he regularly—or phrases like, "Dogs wouldn't follow you," in terms of being a terrible leader.
THERAPIST: Oh God.
CLIENT: Yeah. And getting those kind of things and saying them very nicely and friendly—um—sort of made it in its way into—and I didn't really think about this much until I started talking to you. So I mean, I had thought about it, but I had sort of put it to rest—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —since I had been getting different messages, but I still had it in my subconscious, if that makes sense? I'd still been getting those messages, I just didn't realize where I was getting them from, even though I've left like the—the things like, "Oh, you're a terrible leader," or you know, "People don't believe in you." [00:15:34].6
THERAPIST: You mean like uh—some of the—the mean things he said have kind of stuck around—
CLIENT: They've stuck around. 
THERAPIST: —you can't get them out of your mind?
CLIENT: Yeah. Just where it came from and how bad it really was –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —really hasn't—didn't stay so much as the, you know, authenticity of –
THERAPIST: Right. The fact that it would actually be easier to waive where it came from and stuff, in that then you'd be able to have like more perspective on it? 
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And kind of distance yourself from it in a way that it sounds like –
CLIENT: Well, back when I was there –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 
CLIENT: —I had ways of doing it. Like I had other snarky ways of—of not—not—day-to-day coping.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:16:14].1
CLIENT: You know? That we had all kinds of phrases. Like his name was Dave McClaire (sp). He called himself 'De-Claire' as in this—they had like—like an e-mail first initial like—a thing.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And so we'd often refer to things that got messed up by something he did as being de-claired up or other things like that.
THERAPIST: Ok.
CLIENT: He came from the military but he was an enlisted man—he was this and that, and so, technically his rank really was chief petty officer. And so, you know—and so I occasionally say something like, "Chief Petty Officer, you know, McClaire, wants to speak with you," or, "How come you don't have, like, regulation lunch boxes," like, or something like that.
THERAPIST: Right. [00:16:53].3
CLIENT: It felt—it was very witty, but snarky, you know?
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Day-to-day it kept my sanity.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But since I didn't really have that method of fighting back emotionally on that—you know, on that level –
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: —it um—you know, it—it wasn't as uh –
THERAPIST: Do you have any thought about why the lousy things he said stuck around?
CLIENT: I was at an already, you know, very vulnerable place.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I wasn't feeling very good about myself.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: It happened when I was having some health problems and my husband was acting out like in ways that I just had no way of being able to handle. He wasn't being remotely honest with me about it.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Just my life was very out of control at the time.
THERAPIST: I see. And it was just much harder to fend them off? [00:17:46].3
CLIENT: Yeah. And I really still was trying to make—as of that time, still believing very hard that I wanted to make John's family—you know, earn their respect. 
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: You know, all this other stuff. I was trying to make things happen, but I couldn't. And so, it—you know? And um—he did some—like I said—and I was working technically a managerial-type position, which I will never do again, ever, even—no matter what because we—we still—we—you know, even though I knew it would be a different experience, I just will not do it anymore, because that put me in a situation—I just associate that with being abused on a regular basis, and being undermined by my own supervisor telling my own underlings not to respect me.
THERAPIST: Oh God. [00:18:33].6
CLIENT: I mean, it was bad, it was really bad.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds really bad.
CLIENT: You know, I was set up to fail.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 
CLIENT: You know? He officially was not supposed to do this, but he called me when I was off work for surgery sort of kind of saying that it would be for the best if I stepped down to creative so that—you know, this and that. He was like, "It has nothing to do with your—your health, but boy, you really ought to do this cuz, you know, you really can't—you're not a very good manager." 
THERAPIST: Hmmm.
CLIENT: You know? Yeah. And so um—and he created a culture around him of just the right people, the people that were, you know, willing to rat each other out.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And um—it was just extremely frustrating. And that's—a lot of my self-confidence, first thing, is related to Cincinnati—um—not in terms of how I do my job, but how I relate to certain people that I work with, employees—actually in that way, like specifically like certain types of personalities like—easily bother me, so
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:19:46].8
CLIENT: —and that's just because of the fact that he was—um—you know, he was their bully. So—and he was corrupt and he was a jerk. And like—there just—there—I mean, there—there was nothing—even when it was happening, I knew there was nothing good coming from it. I didn't really believe that he was in any way a good person. Like with my in-laws—my—my mother-in-law, she was very accomplished, she was very educated. I—you know, I couldn't figure out why in the world—you know, I liked her.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I couldn't figure out why she didn't like me. With this guy, it was never like me trying to—struggling for his approval. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: This was like me—and he would have these conversations, and I think I've related this one already. He said, "You know, I think you're probably one of the three or four smartest people in this building." And I had looked at him and I said, "I'm one of the three or four smartest people in this zip code."
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And, "Why are we having this conversation?"
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Because he would do this—you know, I wanted—and he was so formulaic about this. He would say a couple of things he thought were really nice and he thought—was trying to complement me. But I would never take them to heart because they were such bullshit things, like, "I think you're really smart." I really don't think that a person who has no real background in this, that, and the other is really going to be able to give me any sort of pleasure out of being told he thinks I'm smart. You know? And um—so, I haven't really thought a lot about, you know, the Anker stories until then.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But you know, there are definitely some things that were tolerated more than others.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:21:21].2
CLIENT: And um—but they're nothing like the—the story that's right now getting a lot of press in terms of the –
THERAPIST: The Miami store? 
CLIENT: The Miami store, yeah. We're not like that at all. I mean, there was corruption. There was not that kind of like trading futures for plastic surgery kind of co—corruption.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know? Thank God.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But um—and the thing that I just really feel guilty about is the fact that sometimes I became a tool of him, telling people—and this is something that I actually really—like I can't purge. I told Bryant when I was talking to him last night that I—you know, I still feel very guilty about that. He knows that I feel guilty for the—like when he needed to have people find doc—make documentation to have a paper trail to—to reprimand, or punish, or get rid of somebody –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —he would often ask me to do it.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:22:19].0
CLIENT: You know? And in a stupid attempt to try to save my job by seeming like I was competent, I did some really horrible things. There was somebody who—she was having a very hard time with her job, so she created checklists every day so that, you know, saying that something was—you know—
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: —that she did this kind of stuff.
THERAPIST: Ok.
CLIENT: To keep track of what she needed to do?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And then she saved them. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And when she wasn't doing them correctly, I was the one who came up with the—because he put me in—under pressure—of, "Well, she's signing and falsifying company documents, these things weren't done properly."
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I was the one who actually let him have that avenue of –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —he would have never thought about that idea of taking a checklist with her initials on it and falsifying company documents.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:23:07].8
CLIENT: I did that to save my own ass.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And it—it didn't work. But I just feel really bad about that. Not because of the fact that she wasn't incompetent and not that—because that she didn't—needed—she didn't need some of the changes made in her life—um—she didn't belong in that job, but—it's completely true. But the fact is I gave him the tool specifically. Otherwise, he would have had to come up with something else. Something less—Sarbanes-Oxley-related to (laughs)—to terminate somebody with.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know?
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And that just—there's only a few things in my life that I feel really, really bad about that I really feel that I can't forgive myself for.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: This is one of them. I want to, I need to get passed it. And part of it is good that I've moved from the city so I don't feel like I see, you know, the people all the time that I've screwed.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But—it wasn't that many, but it was definitely something that I feel bad about. (pause) It wasn't a means to an end, in terms of anything being good. I didn't truly believe long-term it would save me. It was because I was just scrambling to keep myself from being yelled at that day. I never thought I was ever going to long-term fix anything.
THERAPIST: I see. [00:24:32].2
CLIENT: It was just to get myself out of—
THERAPIST: To avoid getting (inaudible) in the short-term?
CLIENT: Yeah. So it wasn't even like I believed in the—I believed in the principle of it, or I believed in the person, or I believe that long-term it was—I mean, I think it was better for somebody else, but I don't think that was what any of this was really for, what—the intention of that.
THERAPIST: Actually, it sounds like your confidence was completely shot around him.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, the way this guy was getting –
CLIENT: I was walking with a cane all the time –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —at the time. I was taking probably 20 milligrams of, you know, narcotics a day, which is—most people when they get—like I have Vicodin. My Vicodin is less than 5 milligrams, so you know?
THERAPIST: Wow. [00:25:16].9
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: You were (inaudible)
CLIENT: I was taking long—long—
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Yeah. I had—had long-term dosing stuff that you took and it lasted, you know, 12 hours.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And it didn't have—like Vicodin has like analgesics in it. This doesn't have it. This stuff is called Opana. It's made for long—it's an extended-release stuff for people who are in long-term pain.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I was taking a lot of it a day.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Along with, you know, things like that. And I was (pause) freaked out on a regular basis. And so like (pause) it made it so that I really, really have never felt really comfortable in my own skin, ever. Like even—and that's when I actually, disturbingly enough, even stopped going to the grocery store. I don't go to the grocery store much now, but that's more of a timing-related thing. Like right now, my husband would drop me off, because I couldn't walk, and so he's got to pick me up anyways. He's doing the grocery shopping, so that's a timing-related thing.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:26:13].5
CLIENT: But back then it's because of the fact that I just didn't feel comfortable being out in public anymore than I had to because I was like always under this too abrasive eye (ph) that if something got back to me—got back about something that I did that I'd have to deal with it. Like I actually was accused, just really falsely accused, of accepting money for something—like for—accepting money for replacing someone's device that was broken—or phone, or—I don't really remember the actual—I don't really have the name of the person. I never got all of the details. I was horrified, because I would never—I mean, I did—basically who I think it is—the person that I think I did um—that—the person—that the—the manager had made it—at the time—made the decision to replace it without charging them back then. I believe that I probably did charge—didn't charge that person. I never accepted a cent.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:27:08].4
CLIENT: That's something I would never do, especially, you know—I mean, he gave me some brief details about it, and I was just so pissed off and horrified by it I think he never pursued it. But he, you know, just—like why would I accept somebody's $100 to replace something that's probably $100 any—I don't remember very much about it –
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: This was like five years ago, so...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But yeah—but I would never accept anything from that, you know? I don't—I'm funny about accepting anything from customers, in general—um—whereas he has accepted a lot of gifts from customers. So um—yeah he—but it just—to this day—I'm starting to wonder whether or not he just made that up to see how I reacted to it.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: You know what I mean?
THERAPIST: Like he was feeling you out, kind of? 
CLIENT: Yeah, to see if like—to see how—like it was almost like a test to see how I reacted to that kind of thing.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: To see if he got a fight out of me. And I was just (pause)—and um—you know, just find somebody who had something that was completely out of warranty, out of—or broken, and it was taken care of, and claimed something so that I could just, you know, see how it behaved. Um—but the (pause)—the daily—like I said, the only thing I can think of—the word for it is derision—of it, it just—it was just so—if anybody heard that I did anything wrong in the store, they learned to immediately report it to the right people, so that, you know, they would look great –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:28:42].7
CLIENT: —ratting out me for doing something, but they had—you know, that wasn't quite right.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know, and it's like, "Oh God." So (pause) but all the people that he didn't like, he has found a way to move on. Almost all the people he didn't like had some sort of severe health problem, you know. Like someone who had ulcerative colitis who he decided was gaming the system because she only called off work around the times that she got in trouble. Ulcerative colitis is a stress-related disorder. She had parts of her intestine removed. Like this is like—she—
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's—
CLIENT: —like to my knowledge, she may very well be on a colostomy bag right now.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: This is not a faking thing.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But he thought it was very interesting that whenever—you know, there was like a pattern of whenever she got grilled, within that week she ended up having to call off sick.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Even though she was protected by FMLA, she had all this documentation.
THERAPIST: Right. [00:29:38].0
CLIENT: You know? And it just (pause) I feel like I was part of evil at that time. I really do.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: A lot of people who, you know, Cincinnati tends to really care about and take care of, you know, in a really positive way, he didn't like because he felt like it made it more complicated for his day-to-day aspects of having to accommodate things like that. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And so—and—and perhaps it's because he had, by the grace of, you know, whatever, had never really been that sick or had never had anything bad happen to him, so he doesn't have any sort of strong perspective as to how certain things of chronic, you know, health conditions can be. You know? We had a lead genius who—um—you know, they had some—you know, had started having seizures all of sudden, you know, that kind of stuff. Um—he was eliminated, you know? Cincinnati doesn't do this. When, you know—and to give you examples of this, I know of, you know, a campaign when somebody needed to get a kidney transplant, they didn't have enough sick time to keep being paid. I mean, you get like—you get FMLA, but after a certain point you don't get—you only get a percentage of your pay.
THERAPIST: I see. [00:31:08].7
CLIENT: Cincinnati HR started a program so people could donate their extra sick days to this person.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So that—you know, so that anybody who was like in that—and they—they—technically anybody in this company could do it, but it was definitely done—known—like everybody between like New York and D.C., everybody knew about it, and you know, you could donate your extra sick days so that he could be able to get back going, you know? When someone, you know, needed a kidney, they actually had a program where if you wanted to get the quick blood test to see if you're a potential—like, you know –
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: —it –
THERAPIST: I was wondering –
CLIENT: You know?
THERAPIST: —a lot of the things that you described about Cincinnati have to do with the way they really care about the people who work there. 
CLIENT: And part of it—I mean, it is—it is the fact that, you know, you care about the people who give you more. It is true, it is—you know, it is a positive sum game (ph) in terms of this.
THERAPIST: Right. [00:32:02].6
CLIENT: But it's also personally because of heart.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And this kind of stuff is—does—is not like that at all. And so it just—the fact that I was somewhat part of the system I've never really forgiven myself for. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know? (pause) And, you know, there are—I don't know. I just feel really bad about it. I really do. And I don't know if I'll ever be able to purge myself of that. And that's the number one reason why I am so selfless and altruistic to people—um—when it comes to like trying to help people get—not just advanced in terms of like being able to have skills to—to be able to teach or do whatever—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —you know, I really go out of my way to make sure that I—if I hear about something I know and they need something, I really go out of the way to try and make the effort of—like I mentioned—I think it was yesterday, about somebody I know who is coming back from the military. And Cincinnati—
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: —the kind of purse (ph) he has isn't really going to be able to help him out right now.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And so, you know, immediately I read this article on and this and that, and I started sending him all this stuff. I feel like I'm trying to purge myself. And it's not like a one-to-one thing, really, like, "Oh, I did this for one person therefore I have to feel bad if –"
THERAPIST: Right. [00:33:17].1
CLIENT: —it's not like that, but I really do feel like I need to—I don't think I'll be like that forever, but I think that—
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: —I do need to feel on some level so like I did something.
THERAPIST: You made up for it?
CLIENT: I made up for it, because it's so unlike—I—my reality is a little bit un—unorthodox, but I do really feel like I have a strict sense, a rigid sense of ethics when it comes to the business. And there was a period of time where my hand was forced on it.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know? And I didn't really have the guts to stand up to it because I knew that I would—yeah, I—I saw other people who stood up to the system and got knocked down. Therefore, (pause) I was weak-willed. And I just—but like, you know, whoever I was around at the time was the person that I was, you know, of—in favor of, you know? Whenever I was around him, I was going to give him what he wanted to hear. If I was around somebody else, I would give them what they wanted to hear, you know?
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:34:26].9
CLIENT: I mean, not to the extent that people who were my direct reports (ph) were being told what they wanted to hear in terms of like, "Oh, yeah, don't worry. Just bring it in here to work," and—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —you know, "Don't worry about fixing that—that board," or anything like that. But more along the lines of, you know, I was not as harsh to them to their faces as I was behind their back. And I feel awful, you know? I feel especially bad because I did not know until yesterday that (pause) I even—it's—it's so reprehensible and I—the problem is—ok, I should probably explain this to you—you probably know enough computer people know this. People who are extremely computer related will say things sometimes to an—super extreme to the point where they don't realize it's in bad taste. (pause) But (pause)—I was called the Eichmann of that store.
THERAPIST: Oh my gosh. [00:35:31].1
CLIENT: And I know that—that they don't realize that—how amazingly offensive that is.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I didn't know that until yesterday.
THERAPIST: Oh, that they—
CLIENT: That someone referred to me as Eichmann.
THERAPIST: I see. Wow.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And was that this manager or was it somebody else?
CLIENT: No, some of the people that—that, you know—that apparently figured out that I was doing whatever I could to keep going.
THERAPIST: I see. Oy (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah. It wasn't like a commonly called thing, but a couple of people had made a couple of comments about that—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —and that really—I mean—and the thing is I have to take it with a grain of salt because geniuses will say the most outrageously like inappropriate things. They will blow things up sometimes to like levels that it really doesn't need to –
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: —it doesn't need to be said at, you know?
THERAPIST: Right, right. So they were being kind of—
CLIENT: Flippant? [00:36:25].5
THERAPIST: Hyperbolic.
CLIENT: Well, they referred to when Jeremy used to have se—seizures as kernel panics, because that's, you know—when a kernel panic happens on a computer it like, you know?
THERAPIST: Oh, I see. 
CLIENT: Yeah. So that—which sounds amusing, but if you take it like—it—it—
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
CLIENT: —it can easily—it's—unless you—except for the fact that the guy was actually very computer-oriented and took that with a—you know, and took that with a lot of humor, it could be really, really, like, insensitive. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And so I felt really bad about it but I—I didn't realize how much I really felt bad about it after hearing that. And like I said, to mitigate it with, you know, consider the source, saying that—like they don't realize that—that they've lived such a pampered life that the only thing they knew about was what they watched on the History Channel.
THERAPIST: Right. [00:37:11]:0
CLIENT: You know, and they probably don't really know that much. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And at the same time like—I mean, there has to be a grain of truth, or else someone wouldn't say that. Maybe only a grain, but I feel evil now. I feel really evil.
THERAPIST: Hmmm.
CLIENT: Because in the end, you know, I knew it was me, that I would save my own skin. It wasn't because I believed in it long-term. It was just making it day-to-day so I could go another day without being yelled at (pause) for my incompetence. (pause) 
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: No. No, no, not at all (laughs). But still just, you know?
THERAPIST: The only thing I have (ph) is that it might hurt.
CLIENT: It hurts me a lot.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you feel guilty about –
CLIENT: Yeah. I already had a sense of guilt. It wouldn't—if I didn't already feel bad about it, I probably would have been like, "Yeah, you really need to like spend some more time reading history because this is –"
THERAPIST: Right. [00:38:29].2
CLIENT: —but it rang—it's only when I already kind of have a hint of belief in a certain matter, when someone says something that is completely ridiculous –
THERAPIST: I see. 
CLIENT: —that's when—
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
CLIENT: You know? It's only when I—and it doesn't mean that I believe it whole-heartedly or anything like that.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: It's a lot like when, you know, I was—just someone at work flippantly made a joke about me being very, I don't know what it's called—um—oh, damn it—self-centered, but I can't think of the word. Like thinking I am the best at everything, I am very—
THERAPIST: Uh –
CLIENT: (inaudible) I can't think of the word now. 
THERAPIST: (inaudible) or elite or –
CLIENT: No, it was—it's referring to someone as very—it's also pejorative—um—but anyways it's saying that—and the only reason why they said that—it really bothered me when I said all these things—"Oh, don't worry. The—the reason why you're frustrated is because you're so"—narcissist, yeah.
THERAPIST: Oh. [00:39:28].6
CLIENT: That they—that I'm such a narcissist and that's why, like, when you fail at something and it bothers you, you know? That wouldn't have—I would have laughed about it and put it off if I didn't have a hint of thinking that it might be true, you know what I mean, a little bit? And so it's—it's not the whole truth, but—when someone tells me something that I absolutely know about myself, I will agree with them whole-heartedly. It's when I be –- secretly believe something just a little bit, and it's confirmed in passing by somebody else that it really hurts me a lot. You know? (pause) And so (pause) it's only when it has only the—only the—the barest of under—like you—underpinnings of truth, a little bit, is when it really bothers me. Because then I think to myself, "Maybe I'm just fooling myself and I am a jerk." Or maybe I really am like thinking that I'm the best at everything, or, you know, whatever. So... [00:40:31].6
THERAPIST: Yeah. It's a bit mysterious to me where you get these ideas.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Um—
CLIENT: I can probably even tell you what dates that kind—because that kind of stuff doesn't really bother—it doesn't happen to me as much now. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But I could probably even pin down the years that it—it took place, you know?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like between 1995 and, say, 2010, it was really—it was like a 15-year span, I know, but like, that was especially bad for me. Before that, never. Never, ever, never. And after that, it's only when it's like something super bad like being called Eichmann, you know? That's—that's really (laughs)—
THERAPIST: Yeah. That's pretty heavy, yeah.
CLIENT: That's really heavy. And so like—and like I said, it's—it's something where I have to like, sort of like say—you know—consider the source, because they have a lot of—I don't have ways to express to you how much the—the culture lends itself to saying things that are wildly, wildly –
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: —inappropriate. 
THERAPIST: Sure. [00:41:33].8
CLIENT: You know, I mean—
THERAPIST: Yeah, people get really provocative. 
CLIENT: —I mean, like there are things that are being said that are just super, super—um—inappropriate about things.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know? Um—you know, hermaphrodite jokes, all kinds of—like, I mean—
THERAPIST: Oh my goodness.
CLIENT: —they—they don't have that social sense of what is funny and what is not funny.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: You know? So that has to be taken with a grain of salt. But at the same time, if I weren't already doing something to hurt and extinguish the repair business of Cincinnati—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —that wouldn't necessarily—I could laugh it off and say, "Oh my God, I cannot believe you guys just said that," you know?
THERAPIST: Right. [00:42:11].6
CLIENT: So I don't know. It's—it's really messed up. And that's pretty much—but I'm trying to—and I that think in some ways leaving town, like I said, it did help me get that perspective, partially because I had—nobody had, you know, that I had worked for in management –
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: —I had more than a passing conversation maybe once with my old boss –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —and I do know that he said some unpleasant things, but my manager laughed at it—like really, literally laughed it off as, "Wow, he must really not understand Debra at all if he worked for her—with her for six years and he says these kinds of things."
THERAPIST: Right. [00:42:53].8
CLIENT: You know, because he sort of passed it off as me being like an idiot savant, like you know—he—"We need to keep her around because she can memorize all the serial numbers, but, you know, she's not really functional aside from that." You know? Because to him in his smart—small—big—you know, small brain, he never saw the big picture, you know? He never really ever—he—he had such a myopic view of the world, which probably he would make fun of me for saying the word, "Myopic," but he was so—a myopic view of the world that—that was his truth. It was his internal truth. You know? And I think that on some level, he resented people who were smarter than him. He had to go in—into the military as an enlisted man to be able to get the career and training that he needed because he never had the—first of all, the discipline at the time, most likely. But also the—you know, never had the—the—the intellectual resources to better himself.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:43:56].0
CLIENT: You know? And therefore he learned to become a bully. 
THERAPIST: Hmmm.
CLIENT: And it was only after—and—and the thing is I hadn't told my people that I knew, like, who he had worked with in the military –
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: —that there's no bully—there's no bully like an enlisted man who has made it up the ranks. Not an officer, but an enlisted man, because he hates the people—
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: —above him. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And he's disgusted by the people below him.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And so—yeah.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. I think we're going to stop –
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: —for now. 
CLIENT: So—I can't believe that it—you know, it's something that—it's sort of—not really blocked from mind, but I haven't really mentioned much until now, so—I will see you next week.
THERAPIST: Next week, yeah. And thank you.
CLIENT: Oh you're welcome. We're going to the park.
THERAPIST: Sounds good.
