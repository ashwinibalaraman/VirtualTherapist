BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: Sorry I'm...public transit was against me this day.
THERAPIST: Ah, oh no.
CLIENT: I missed my bus and walked, and then missed the train pulling in, even though it's a regular scheduled.
THERAPIST: Oh really?
CLIENT: Yeah, [inaudible—00:00:17] weekday, but I just...the bus was early and then... [Pause.]
THERAPIST: I'm around Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday next week. Are you as well?
CLIENT: That's what...I need to cancel an appointment because I have physical therapy. Thanksgiving next week. Oh my God. I am not ready for that. I need to cancel; I need to cancel an appointment. I need to cancel on the 27th.
THERAPIST: 27TH.
CLIENT: Which is two weeks from tomorrow, Tuesday.
THERAPIST: Okay. [inaudible—01:16] to the recordings on, do you mind just texting you and I'll...
CLIENT: Sure. I'm just...
THERAPIST: I guess I can...you know I can do that on...
CLIENT: No, I'll just do it right now. It's fine.
THERAPIST: It'll probably take me longer, but...
CLIENT: No. I put it in my phone as a reminder because I can't remember it otherwise.
THERAPIST: Good for next week and it sounds like it's the following week; that one day.
CLIENT: Yes. And then also Thursday next week you're here Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Okay. Whew. [Pause.]
[00:02:03]
So I've been trying to...[pause]...blog a little bit about, I don't know, taking time off for disability and feeling depressed and like various other things. And one of the problems for me is like sometimes when I write something, it's kind of like, and I feel these like intense scary rush-ins. It's really hard for me to go back and respond to any of my friends who are commenting, because am like...because I'm so...I don't know, it's kind of exhausting to run it all out. And then responding time, I'm just like I don't know what I'm really...I'm not ready to rehash it or I don't even know. Like sometimes I really appreciate comments and I always read them, and this is all friends of mine basically, but I don't know. Sometimes it's hard to like respond to any one giving an in depth reply, which I always feel bad about. But that's the way it is.
So I had written about something that's happening a lot which is that I feel like I need reasons for feeling emotions; like I need like a charter, a carefully Para-dossier. And one of my friends who like does a lot of work for Wikipedia and other things like that, her comment, which I thought was amazing, was that I'm treating my brain and my emotions like a Wikipedia article. Like you know, requires multiple intense register verification. And I'm just like, oh my God, that's a really great metaphor and it's accurate. And then she joked, like to extend the metaphor, if there's ever an edit war over something like I would totally back you up in the edit war. Which was really funny, but also I thought like kind of hit at a lot of what I worry about.
So one, her comment might be that I feel like I do need independent like control [inaudible—04:53] backing up. But her comment about edit wars really struck me. [Pause.] I guess because I feel like so edit wars have for these reasons. And they're often super winky and you know, blah, blah, blah; it's often like political reasons or blah, blah, blah, blah. Or gossip, or whatever.
[05:28]
And so I guess part of what I want is someone to back me in an edit war and like protect the article so it can't be changed—like super overextending the metaphor, but that, I think...
THERAPIST: I think often something you want when you're telling me things.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: Yeah. You sort of hunkering down as you're talking for a possible edit war. And wanting to make sure you have my backing and what you feel inside.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: You okay?
CLIENT: Yeah, just I'm sweaty. The chair is fine. [Pause.] I'm kind of sort of the weird part of the metaphor is, you know, if I am thinking of myself as Wikipedia article that, but I don't need it for verification, but also thinking, well yeah, but I also really want I guess affirmation support for..[pause]...not [inaudible—00:07:12], but like for me, for me-ness. How that sounds? But also hunkering down to like have all the reasons why it doesn't ...[pause]...can be like a barrier to talking about how I feel because they could take this extra layer of...[pause]...not rationalization, but like, I don't know. I don't always trust people so I want that extra layer just in case. [Pause.] And not that it's conscious, because I can do it with people that I do trust except...
[00:08:11]
THERAPIST: Well there seems to be one person in particular that you have some trouble with not trusting you. [Pause.]
CLIENT: My mom.
THERAPIST: Oh well, yeah. I was thinking you.
CLIENT: Oh. Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah, but right, yes. I mean it's your mom too. But I was thinking you. [Pause.]
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: And there are others like in here...[pause]...I haven't generally heard that it was a measurable need. And nobody else is really going to know...[pause...] so there's going to be doubting how you're feeling.
CLIENT: It's me doubting.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Pause.]
CLIENT: I just think; I feel like a part of it is—I haven't quite found the word but—it's something that I've done for so long that it's really hard to conceive of not. Like when you've asked me sometimes like well, you know, like why is it wrong for me to be angry or you know, why do I have to be the one to sort of to guess her and everybody else's emotions or psychosis or whatever. And I understand what you're saying, but like on a deep level, it just feels like because, like, you know; I'm like it's just how I've been doing that and I've done that for quite a while. And at this point it feels like well that's just what; if feels natural, in a weird way. Like that's just what I've been doing for a while. [Pause.]
[00:10:58]
Some would feel that way about talking about my work. It's super hard to not talk really negatively about work or to respond to someone. Like a friend of mine is working at the business school now and she's got a managerial job. And it's amazing. Like they love her, she loves them; it's fantastic.
So she was talking about how she just mediated an argument, something, between two coworkers that had been going on for over a year and just no one had bothered to sit down and be like, "Okay guys, let's work it out." And she was glad to do it. She was also appalled that it took, you know, all this time and she was like, yeah, it's really great that...and then she was saying management here is really easy. People say they want to do something cool. And I tell them to go do it. And if they have a problem, I'm like, "Okay, how can we fix it?" Blah, blah, blah. And you know, my first response is, yeah, it was pretty much like that is great. It's really too bad that my work place is the opposite of that. And I spent like ten minutes trying to think of a way to say that less negatively or to not...if she seems to me kind of awesome, I really didn't have to be like bah, nah.
THERAPIST: Right.
[00:12:56]
CLIENT: And I couldn't. I just sort of...[pause]...I really ended up talking, I was like I really wanted to say something in response that's not negative about my work place but again...[pause.] And so I don't know. [Pause.] It's different. That was like my major reaction to work is pretty much; is negative. It's not going to work. It's not going to improve. It's going to suck. Blah.
And while that's also true in many ways, I also sometimes feel like well maybe I should not always articulate that. Like maybe it would be good to not or to like try to tone down like my natural response is kind of, "Fuck you," and maybe I could just surmise that a little bit, which is something.
[00:14:18]
But in terms of trusting myself, you know, it's kind of me against me. [Pause.] I mean I do think it's kind of...I do think it's a pattern of behavior that is not really habitual so much as like naturalized. Like I feel like I just feel like that is how it is. You know, like people just won't trust what I say and people just aren't going to believe me. [Pause.] And I would like to stop feeling that way because the [inaudible—15:11].
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But...[pause]...it's one of those that's really hard to, it's hard to argue; I feel like it's hard to review with myself because I'm mad at myself. And I don't know. It also feels harder than other changes I've consciously made to how I think about things. [Pause.] Like in terms of accepting compliments, which I'm still not great with. I really just...I spent years consciously like reminding myself do not argue with this person. Say thank you even if you don't feel like you...even if it doesn't matter. Like just say thank you. And eventually it wasn't just me saying that because that was the right thing to say. I was kind of like, "Okay." I kind of feel this "thank you" more in my blah, blah, blah. [Pause.]
[00:16:32]
But I don't really know; I kind of feel stuck on how to apply that conceptually to trusting how I feel or not doubting myself.
THERAPIST: Uh huh. [Pause.]
CLIENT: And the compliments wasn't really ...[pause]...I wasn't doubting how I felt about whatever. Like I like my outfit. I like my whatever. It was just...It was really hard for me to believe the other person was sincere. And then also I felt uncomfortable like being on display of everyone else's attention. Like all these other things.
But I felt like relatively sure that like I liked how I looked or I liked what I was doing.
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, I have that sense too.
CLIENT: But with this, it's like I don't like...[pause]...I don't have some external; it's like I have self confidence and I'm [inaudible—17:57]. I just argue with myself, so there's not like, I don't know that I can fake it until I make it with my own self. [Pause.]
[00:19:11]
THERAPIST: Well, I don't even really know what's going on with this. [Pause.] Or I will speak for myself. I don't really know what's going on with this. I mean there seems to be some parallels with your mother. You seem to wind up, at times, with people are employers and people that are ...where this gets played out between you and other people. [Pause.] But...[pause.]...yeah, I have also, at times, wondered...[pause]...whether there are...[pause]...some ways that some of the cycle stuff that you eventually trace back to this. [Pause.] Of being dominated. [Pause.] I want to be clear that I'm not trying to apologize that, but I am saying I can imagine some of the feel could be similar, although...[pause]...generally like actually that's fun whereas let's say at work it sucks. But I find there may be some similarities. It wouldn't be the first time somebody did something that sexually was fun, but in real life, wasn't. [Pause.]
[00:21:34]
But anyway, [pause]...I mean I guess part of the reason I sort of bring that up is because you know one possibility for feeling...I think you are sort of stuck in this is that unconscious sexual gratification in it, and that's how it happens. But there is certainly more going on if it's there at all. I can explain more of what I mean, but most of what I'm saying is I don't really know what's going on with it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So I think it's pretty important in your life. [Pause.]
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't feel like I have a handle on it either. [Pause.] What I was thinking more with like with sexual things, we'll say post [inaudible—00:22:58] is [pause]...I don't feel like I trust myself or how I feel like during sex. Like [inaudible—00:23:13] sex. I just...[pause]...I'm worried that my gut is wrong . [Pause] Or that like, I worry about a lot of things, but...
THERAPIST: Could we say that began because one way of looking at what happened with Josie or one aspect of what happened with Josie is that the distinction of between this, that it being kind of fun and playful in the bedroom and crummy outside got blurred. [Pause.]
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.] I mean, and one of the things that, you know, for doing like a dynamic; it wasn't that she was saying when it was going well, she wasn't saying like you don't feel this way or whatever. It's more like I know you feel this way and I guess I'm going to control that or I'm going to take away like some of your agency regarding that feeling. [Pause.] And then, you know, at its worst, it was more like you don't feel that way. You're actually doing this. It was her need to exert control over what I was thinking and doing. Like who can control their consensual reality. She wanted hers to be the right one and wasn't willing to consider anyone else. [Pause.] And I think, you know, I also think that in many...I mean I think some of it was not deliberate. I think some of it probably was deliberate. But [pause]...I mean she definitely made some really direct hits at my own fears about being much more in reality than I am and losing touch with reality. [Pause.] And two of the hits were I think I was [inaudible—26:49] voices or actually saying that she thought of this, experiencing intrusive thoughts. And then also [pause], you know, just saying that like something; I just flat out had not remembered something correctly or even like that did not happen.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: [Pause.] And yeah, I'm aware that this [inaudible—27:34] people. I will kind of be like, "Oh, okay, I guess." You're so insistent on this being true that maybe I'm wrong and you're right. This really is; like you really are correct about the sky being purple. [Pause]. But you know, with Josie was so much more in to that and also like in that way, where someone's in a lot of pain and they hit like big over the love load like she did. Like she really hit where it hurt and I still feel bad. And like if someone propositions me, it's very difficult for me to say yes because like my...like all of my...half of my reaction is I don't always tend to know if someone is really flirting with me. Kind of like oh, [inaudible—28:54]. Blah, blah, blah; whatever. But the other part is I get kind of panicked of distant from how I feel, so I'm just like well; I don't know. Do I want to do that? Would that be fun? I'm not really sure. And I might be just doing this because this person asked and like this whole like...[pause.] It's harder not to just get really stuck in doubt.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Pause.]
CLIENT: I mean not just doubt, but also...I probably get stuck in self doubt, but I also get sort of hit up against the will I know when I want to stop? Will I recognize this is nothing anymore? Will I say something about it? And will the person actually stop? And will they be a dick about it? And...[pause]. I mean there are a lot of times when I have played with people, like friends or people I know, like much more briefly, there's a certain level of like you know I'm talking to the person and negotiating or flirting or whatever we're doing. It's kind of like well, does it seem like; do you seem interesting to me? Are you interested in me? Can we find some way to like make this all work?
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: A certain amount of that is just like chemistry or whatever. And people are like, "Oh, you should ask for references. You should talk to friends." I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah. But my friends, it's not like if I ask this person for like three people if they talk to. I'm like well, like in the end, I'm trusting in those other people also told the truth or and that you haven't changed as a person since that time is this whole...so you know. When you get right down to it, it's do I think I can trust you or not. [Pause.] And that's huge.
THERAPIST: I think we're going to stop.
CLIENT: Okay.
