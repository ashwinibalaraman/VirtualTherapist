BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay [PATIENT NAME], you were here in September and when I saw you in September it was not a good time for you, you had lost a job, you had been down in the dumps, you were having some issues with your girlfriend, you were questioning where you were going to be living perhaps if she put you out.  My recollection is that it was not a good time for you.
<b>PT:</b> I think that things have not quite, things haven't changed very much.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I am still out of work -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I've had a number of calls from places that I've sent or interneted resumes, most of which have, you know, it doesn't get past the initial call, in fact I have one now where I've went to, went to the bank, this was from a resume that I sent a while ago and I had one phone interview and then in interviewed with the manager of the department and so it wasn't exactly the position I wanted, it was for a lower position but I wanted to get my face in front of him and tell him about my experience so maybe, you know, they'll change their mind and hire someone with  my experience, so I'm waiting, waiting to hear.  The basic thing is that the money that I would like isn't what they're offering.
<b>DR:</b> Well [PATIENT NAME], I recall a patient I had seen, obviously, a very different set of circumstances, he was from some eastern European country and he was the equivalent of the governor of the state of Pennsylvania, let's say, he was also trained as a lawyer, taught at the law school part time in addition to being the governor of his, whatever, municipality and he came here with his wife and daughter to give her a better life, I guess primarily the daughter, was pumping gas nights.  His degree didn't mean squat here.  The fact that he was a governor in his own country didn't mean anything here and it was very depressing for him but he said, you know what, I don't want to be doing this for the rest of my life here but I've got to put food on the table for my family so am I embarrassed, am I ashamed, I'm all of that but I don't care, I'm motivated, I have to learn the language, you know, I have to do this, I have to do that, so as you're talking about jobs, I hope you have some flexibility maybe and are willing to move a little bit to the right or the left or up or down, you know, within reason, I mean you don't want to be flipping burgers I don't think but -
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.
<b>DR:</b> Because that in itself would be a little depressing I think but, you know, you may not find the plumb job and this is not a great time of the year.  People start shutting down.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And it's kind of like this, you know, dead zone between now and New Years, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.  I'll see what they offer and I know what, well I already know what they offer, I was asking them to push it a little bit higher into my area.  The person said that they had been, they have on schedule for someone next year to come in on my level and then she said well maybe I can convince people to do it, you know, the other way around but I'm willing to, you know, give up a little.  The person at home won't be happy at that but that's there -
<b>DR:</b> You know [PATIENT NAME], I see this guy who I've been seeing for a few months and it's like I've been seeing him for years.  He's just so out of control this guy.  He is a lawyer who I think has been at least, can you be disbarred twice, but he's been so incapacitate but he made a lot of money as a lawyer so that he has savings but he and his wife split.  He's about your age I guess, maybe a little, roughly your age, and his wife said I don't care what you do, you just have to get out of the house and be doing something, something productive, I don't care what it is.
<b>PT:</b> Tomorrow morning I start with [DEIDENTIFIED] selling. I have a friend of mine, I'd like to call him a friend, who is the manager of the [DEIDENTIFIED] store and a couple of weeks ago I started talking to him and I ran down there last week and I told him my situation and he said okay why don't we start, because my younger years were raised in a, my mom's family was all haberdashers so I spent years selling men's clothes -
<b>DR:</b> You can do that stuff.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well good.  Well this guy, actually his job, he did the same thing, his friend runs a pawn shop, it's a non paying job, he just has to show up basically and just stay out of trouble.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yours will be a paying job though.
<b>PT:</b> If I sell -
<b>DR:</b> If you sell, okay, fine, but at least, you know what, at least it forces you to be up, around people, moving, talking, maybe, you never know who you might run into and hey, a lot of things.  I've got guys [PATIENT NAME] that are, you know, kind of, we'll say, in between stuff and they're selling cars, they're doing this, they're doing that and, you know what, there's no shame in that, I mean it's a sign of resiliency, it's a sign of understanding that, you know, you have to do something, you can't just cave and just cower in the corner, you know, saying pity me and poor me and whatever, you've got to do what you've got to do.  Eventually it'll, hopefully, lead to something more in line with what you want, including the salary and benefits and all that stuff, so that's good.
<b>PT:</b> So in my own defense, if I've got to defend it, it's just that I had to get my mind around the idea of doing it because, as you may be aware that I have a career counselor that I go to and she's been pushing it for a while and, you know, she's been saying go find something, we've talked about it and I said no, no, no, getting static at home and I just decided that I would, you know, finally get done and it's Christmas so it makes sense to do it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah sure.  You know, [PATIENT NAME] I was reminded of a patient I saw, she was a hardworking woman, she worked at like one of these big box stores like [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] or something and her husband was a smart guy who had a good job with a company, made good money, and he was laid off, something happened, I forget what it was, and for a year or two years, whatever, she saw him as doing nothing but sitting around doing nothing and she would, it would become a source of a lot of friction and she would say my God just get up and do something, go somewhere, look at me, I'm working for Walmart or whatever she was doing and he said, he would look down at her, do you know what kind of a job I had, do you know who I was, that's beneath me and I need to, I'm not wasting time, I'm inventing things here, I'm trying to generate some big ideas and, of course, that may have been try to some extent but she just saw him, she saw herself working like a dog for, you know, basically minimum wage and this guy is sitting around, you know, eating, watching TV, doing this and that and not really being productive.  He wasn't necessarily depressed or anything like that but it was a source of friction for them and understandably.
<b>PT:</b> The friction I get is that it's kind of okay to go get a job in a store or anywhere but don't do it in the neighborhood where people will see me.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, wow.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what I've got, so I picked [DEIDENTIFIED] which is totally, you know, I'll be there for everybody to see me.
<b>DR:</b> That's interesting [PATIENT NAME], you know, I certainly can see why some people would think that way but I think that's kind of single minded and -
<b>PT:</b> Short sighted.
<b>DR:</b> Not just short sighted, I don't know but kind of says more about that person than about you, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Because I've known, I've known people, doctors and lawyers who've done stuff like, you know, selling at stores, not because necessarily they needed the money, although certainly the money helps but because they liked whatever it was, whether it was selling cars or selling boats or selling, you know, hiking equipment and they liked people, they had free time and they're thinking what the heck, they maybe had ideas about starting their own business, they wanted some experience in things, there's nothing wrong with that.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so let's see.
<b>DR:</b> Are you still seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm glad you mentioned that.  I was going to -
<b>DR:</b> I mentioned it because I owe him a phone call.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, well I'm not seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> He wasn't, he wasn't giving me everything that I needed.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I found another psychologist, a [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's a good guy.
<b>PT:</b> Sort of up the road, down there on [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, he's big with the office of vocation rehabilitation, he's very plugged into the kind of, you know, the work aspects and vocational things, career stuff.
<b>PT:</b> Well, he knows about ADD -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He's treated people with it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He's also more my age so I've been able to relate to him better.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And in my mind, he's got more experience.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I've seen him three times, yesterday was the third time.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I've gotten more in hand information from him than I have from any of the psychologists that I've seen.
<b>DR:</b> Well, he's very much, he's a psychologist but he's been always very plugged into not just the social worker kind of scene but specifically work related stuff, career employment type stuff, so yeah he's a good guy.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, well he hasn't said -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, he does -
<b>PT:</b> He said that he was involved in [DEIDENTIFIED] with the VA -
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, I didn't know that.
<b>PT:</b> For twenty years and he's on this and that -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, he does a lot of stuff with educational stuff, schools and things like that too
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, he's good.
<b>PT:</b> In fact, he's not a real, he's not a doctor of psychology, he's a doctor of education.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  There's so many different doctoral degrees, you know -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> EDD, PhyD, PHD, whatever, but he's been around a long time.  Many of my patients have seen him, let's put it that way.
<b>PT:</b> So right now he seems to be what I need or what I wanted -
<b>DR:</b> Right, right, right.
<b>PT:</b> Put it that way -
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> What keeps coming to the fore, wait a minute, let me just make sure I told you about [NAME OTHER] and the bank and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] who was the career counselor, the change with [DEIDENTIFIED] and I'm sort of experimenting, although it's costing me money, with this other kind of career counselor who is religious based but he is from, I got his name from a fellow across the street from me who needed some counseling, he was plugged into him, the guys name, not my friend but the guy I'm working with, his name is [NAME OTHER] and he's from the [DEIDENTIFIED] in someplace -
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> And he is a graduate of some religious college and has a two year degree in career counseling.  He is, it's mostly by name recognition, he doesn't advertise or anything like that, he has a web site so people find him, people from all over the world find him -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> So his claim to fame is that I've got patients all around the world but it's all, so far it's been about talking on the telephone and what I mean by that is that on Tuesday evenings at seven o'clock I try to remember to call him and I say try because usually I've just finished dinner and totally forgotten so he calls me and we sit on the phone for about forty five minutes.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And we talk about, you know, I've sent him a whole bunch of information about me and he has put me in contact with two books, one of which I'm in the process of reading, one is calle"Do What You Are" [DEIDENTIFIED] by [NAME OTHER] or something like that and basically the book is written as part of the Myers Briggs.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And Myers Briggs  breaks you down in these sixteen categories so the whole book is based on where are you, you're in here somewhere -
<b>DR:</b> Right, right, right.
<b>PT:</b> So I've started to read that -
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Which is more than [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] so I have a little trouble with [PHYISICIAN NAME OTHER] but we're moving okay, kind of, although [NAME OTHER] is not happy.  I usually talk to him on Tuesday and I will talk to him tonight and so he has given me, you know, at least a book to read.  I couldn't make much sense out of "What Color is Your Parachute" but this book has more relevance for I guess [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Right, right, sure.
<b>PT:</b> So we're kind of working that way and I'll probably stay with him for a couple more weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And we'll see.
<b>DR:</b> You know what, you [PATIENT NAME] when I look at you, see when we last met, you were kind of downtrodden and I don't want to say feeling hopeless but things were not looking good for you, your perception of things and while things may not have improved in practical tangible ways, I think you're a very different person today, you know, I think you're doing a whole lot of stuff, you're making a lot of effort, you seem like you have, you know this is not in your hands and yet you're, you know, you're using a lot of resources, you're energetic, you're moving and something good is going to come from all this.
<b>PT:</b> It's really the dead but the other thing is and I did forget to tell you is that I've just about signed up for taking some more accounting courses.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> At [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I met with the professor responsible for the accounting department and we chatted for a while and he was able to, he waived for me certain courses so I can get to auditing.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm in this accelerated program two nights a week starting in January that in six weeks I should have, hopefully, have the course done and then start on the course on auditing which is, I had explained to him why I needed it, because the CPAs tend to get bent out of shape because I don't have that or have a degree in accounting but I want to stay with that and pick up the next three courses because at the end of that, I then get certification as an accountant without any experience but I would be able, if I choose, to take the CPA exam, I'd have enough knowledge to be able to do that.
<b>DR:</b> Good, good, so it looks like to me like, you know, you're trying to not necessarily reinvent yourself but move yourself in different directions to make yourself either more marketable or open up different opportunities for yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> There are days when things don't happen and I am pretty much at my wits end thinking about those things
<b>DR:</b> Those things like what, like not wanting to be alive?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Typically after getting, typically after another discussion with [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> No surprise there.
<b>PT:</b> And because I take that stuff to heart that she's telling me number one and number two, the stuff that we get, we argue about is things that, the stuff that I get angry at when we are arguing is me because, as I was telling [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] because [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] pointed it out is that and I never had, no, I didn't have really good role models growing up so the usual give and take, the innocuous statements that really don't hurt anybody, I don't know how to do, I'm a big you person, you messed up, you did this, why didn't you do that, I am trying desperately to learn I statements but where my problem is, is trying to say to the person that you didn't do this or you didn't do, without saying that.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], I'm going to ask you a question as you're walking out because I don't want you to get all bent out of shape.  Anyway, you've been taking the Effexor?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Why did I -
<b>PT:</b> Why do you think I get all bent out of shape?
<b>DR:</b> Well we'll find out when I ask you the question later.  So you're taking the 75 mg, three of them?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and you're taking the Ritalin.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The regular Ritalin and the LA, 10 and 30.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> What I find is that the Ritalin, you know, I take the Ritalin -
<b>DR:</b> Short acting.
<b>PT:</b> At say four o'clock, the second one
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And -
<b>DR:</b> You're talking about the LA?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, the LA -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Somewhere, depending on when I get up.  If I would take the first one, say at seven or eight in the morning, about three o'clock, when I leave here I'll take the second one, by the evening time, if I'm sitting at home, I probably don't take the short acting and I probably should but more than the Ritalin is that I feel like the Effexor is sort of going like that.  By the end of the day
<b>DR:</b> Meaning it's washing away?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's not because that Effexor stays in your system twenty four, seven, it may be that you take it in the morning and because there's some more Norepinephrine component that you may feel that, less, I don't want to say stimulation but as far as, you know, antianxiety and antidepressant effect, that should not change during the course of the day.  I think it's probably unrelated, that feeling that you have.
<b>PT:</b> I think it happens when I, when she gets home.
<b>DR:</b> That doesn't surprise me either.
<b>PT:</b> Waiting for, you know, waiting for the shoe to fall.
<b>DR:</b> I think you're probably right.
<b>PT:</b> Sitting there with this tension, you know, do I say something.  She's not going to say anything, I guess I should say something but if I don't say something, she's not going to say anything.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] I want to tell you this, I gave your resume to that person and little did I know, the guy is like never around, he's like traveling all over the country, the world, I don't know where the hell he is but he did send me a card and specifically mentioned your resume in there and said, you know, you gave me this resume and, you know, we should talk about it so he, I got that letter, he was around for a day or two and then back somewhere in Florida.  He's trying to help somebody set up some business in Arizonaand I don't know what the hell he goes to, you know, he's in Europe. [DEIDENTIFIED], whatever.  I will make it a point to reach out to him because I'll just wish him, you know, holiday cheer and I'll say, you know, I just wanted to talk to you about that resume.  So I didn't forget about you, I said I would put it in somebody's hands, I obviously can't guarantee you that it's going to translate into a job.
<b>PT:</b> Is he the only hands that we can put it in?
<b>DR:</b> Well, I was thinking about, he's a guy that I think, I see as one of the most influential and powerful people I know that is, you know, is in the business world let's say.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> But no, I mean I have people who are accountants, I have people who are, I have one guy I know who is a, he's like a headhunter in medical sales type jobs.  I don't know if you have any experience in anything there but, you know, I have to, I have to figure some things out.  I have a guy who was a very smart guy working on I think his masters or PhD, bad relationship, girlfriend kicked him out, you know, stuff like that, divorced and -
<b>PT:</b> Where did he go?
<b>DR:</b> Where did he go?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I have no place to go -
<b>DR:</b> You know where he went?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You won't believe this.  He was working kind of just keeping busy like, again, trying to appease somebody working at Sears I think selling, it didn't work out and, but he said it was kind of fun doing it for a while.  I hooked him up with a guy I know who is a solo, is a lawyer, you know, he practices in a solo practice and this guy that I sent him to is, he's very bright, very articulate, very well read and he loves doing like research and stuff so I hooked him up and the guy was giving him, you know, he was paying him to do like research for him and work for him and so he's learning about, you known, the legal system and stuff and so, and the guy said look, I can pay you ten bucks an hour and we'll see, I could probably end up using you, I'll use you this many hours, so he's been working more and more hours for this guy..  Anyway, when the guy's girlfriend put him out, the guy he had been working with for a few months said look, in the office there's a room on the back that has a bathroom and shower and whatever, he said why don't you stay there for as long as you need to.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not that lucky.
<b>DR:</b> I put those two guys together.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Anyway, listen, the question I wanted to ask you and I'll ask you now and I'm going to write you the prescriptions for the Effexor and the Ritalin and the Ritalin.  The question is [PATIENT NAME], I don't want to, I don't want to insert myself where I don't belong because I'm not a mini therapist of sorts, you know, for the short time we have, I'm supposed to be managing your medication and all that stuff but I can't help but thinking, you know, you're living with this woman, you know, who needs who more and I'm sure, well I'm not sure but I would wonder if there's part of you that says that maybe this person or relationship is not, not as healthy as I would like it to be or I think it is and maybe even contributing to how I feel and in a sense putting me further behind, you know, the eight ball, you know what I'm thinking, like I don't -
