BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, um, [NAME OTHER] was telling me that, you know, you want to put the stuff up there on the board before we get started?
<b>PT:</b> Is that all right?
<b>DR:</b> I'd love it; I mean it's great to -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> It looks like we're finally able to erase it somewhat so -
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> But yeah, I think that this is a good use of this board, and it gives us some -
<b>PT:</b> I'll abbreviate it.
<b>DR:</b> Some goals to focus on as we're discussing.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was having problems with my back, I had to go see a chiropractor about eight times, then my sciatic nerve bothers me, then I go to occupational therapy.
<b>DR:</b> Did the chiropractor help you?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not, not for the sciatic nerve, but for the back it, he said I have arthritis in the back.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Did they do some films on it?
<b>PT:</b> No he didn't because my insurance doesn't cover it.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum, um-hum.  Well -
<b>PT:</b> I mean he said I that I'd go to the hospital, but I still wouldn't, get to go into the emergency room or something?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I just saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] at 3:00.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good, okay.  So you got to talk about all this stuff with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] as well, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.  Yeah, [NAME OTHER] asked me, she said, "Uh, I've been calling it writing on this board, and" -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And she goes, "I saw something and he was erasing it."
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I, I didn't want her to sneak a peak at it, because I know that you guys talk and you're friends, so.
<b>PT:</b> Oh -
<b>DR:</b> Most people wouldn't of connected these things, but, um, but we finally got an eraser for our board here, so that's kind of nice.
<b>PT:</b> Actually, I do like bringing my own marker.
<b>DR:</b> Let me see that marker.  Is it a dry erase marker or is it some sort of permanent?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Dry eraser, yeah, I made sure, yeah, I wouldn't of wrote it on there without.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I can get it, I can get it out with, um, alcohol swabs.
<b>PT:</b> Oh really?
<b>DR:</b> In any case, okay, so here we are, of course, um, [INAUDIBLE] it doesn't surprise me that you've, uh, on the top of the list.  That's, um, that's a good positive list.  And we've struggled with all of those areas before, you know?  Um-
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> How we doing with the drinking of the pop?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I, I, I was hoping they'd have water.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so it's not a big -
<b>PT:</b> No, huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> I do see, I see a lot of people that drink a lot of pop and don't even realize it, you know?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Even a diabetic, they manage to drink a 1000, easily 1000 calories of pop a day, and you know, her blood sugars are all out of whack, so  my, come on, two-pack a day smoker, and -
<b>PT:</b> Wow!
<b>DR:</b> And she's on medicines now because she can't breath.  It's almost like it's some kind of a test.  Are you a smoker?
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't smoke, I quit when I was, found out I was pregnant.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you.
<b>PT:</b> Already 20 years ago.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so family, here we see on the negative side of things though, still arguing with brother.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, that, that's an ongoing battle.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Who's older again, you or?
<b>PT:</b> I'm older, he's like [AGE], I think.
<b>DR:</b> All right, we've moved up the sobriety date.  Is that, is that accurate?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, that's accurate.
<b>DR:</b> [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I called -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know, on a Thursday night, and then I was drinking like the whole weekend.
<b>DR:</b> Does your brother know about the -
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm not about to tell him.  Hum-um.
<b>DR:</b> Does [NAME OTHER]'s parents know about that?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, well actually I was talking to my son right after it happened, and I said something about drinking two bottles of wine.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I said something about, I said something about put it, be put in the hospital, and he goes well oh, he goes, "Well that's going to effect you watching the baby, your grandson."  I said, "Oh no, no, no, he's not doing it for that, he's doing it for a medication adjustment."  So, I couldn't tell him the real, and anyway they had a couple bottles of wine, which I didn't touch, I hadn't [INAUDIBLE] alone.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But, um, no I have, but I mean, then, so I wouldn't drink their wine anyway, I don't plan on doing, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you going to AA?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Doing it on my own.
<b>DR:</b> What do you think about AA, I mean do you?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think I'm an alcoholic.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah you think I am?
<b>DR:</b> I don't know, I mean, you've got a lot of trouble.
<b>PT:</b> I mean.
<b>DR:</b> It's caused a lot of trouble in your life; I mean it gives you -
<b>PT:</b> I think I'm -
<b>DR:</b> But you wouldn't disagree with that, would you?
<b>PT:</b> No, I wouldn't disagree.
<b>DR:</b> And if you think about, are you familiar with AA and like their motto and have you gone to any of their meetings in the past?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> I mean are you familiar with the 12 steps?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah because I was going to, I might go back to Emotions Anonymous, that's on Saturday mornings.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Now that I like.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well the thing with the 12 steps, I mean, some of it's, it's hard to kind of argue with, especially I think it's, step four the, um, you know, the moral inventory.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And looking at all the things that have been related to drinking -
<b>PT:</b> Right, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then making amends to that, but I, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, because they do, they do say, um, uh, like character defects, see that, um, I realize it's a program, they want to get their message across, but I, I don't like it when you use a defect, it's like rule number one is negative, number two, I, I don't know, I just don't, I don't like that.  They can work something, do something different -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> From all this negative or whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Well, yeah, I think, you know, not everybody agrees with a lot of the approach of AA, but I think, um, I don't know, most people can take a look at it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah -
<b>DR:</b> It makes you think for themselves, you know.
<b>PT:</b> I could tell you, do you want to know what actually happened, started this whole thing?
<b>DR:</b> Hm?
<b>PT:</b> And I told, I was telling this to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] it was in our last session we were talking about it, and so we, so we talked a lot about that, so that's all talked out, I mean that's all, all put away, in the past.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> What's the back problem?  Is this a new thing?
<b>PT:</b> No, I have, he said I, I could in a couple weeks, but I couldn't, you know, get up out of the chair, I couldn't get in and out of a car, and I didn't do any lifting or anything like that and then when I went to the chiropractor he said, "Well you have arthritis in your back."  And I said, "Well, how do you, how do you know?"  And he said, "Well, you have arthritis in your neck so you, people over 40 usually get it in their back too."  Then he mentioned about the x-rays.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And then, um, so he worked on it, but there's two places, well you probably know, two places in your back that the back hurts when he touch, when they touch, I mean the fanny packs are touching it, and it hurts.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So I don't know if that's the arthritis or what, and he was giving me stretch exercises to do, but that wasn't doing anything.  So the one, the one time he, he had me laying on my back, or my stomach and he was pressing on both those areas and he said, "You can scream here if you want".  I said, "No that's okay," but it really hurt a lot.  Then he went to the one area, the other area.
<b>DR:</b> Well another concern I suppose -
<b>PT:</b> No, no, don't tell me, you're going to say it.
<b>DR:</b> What?
<b>PT:</b> Aren't you going to say my weight?
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> That's what my -
<b>DR:</b> This is, this is -
<b>PT:</b> My brother said -
<b>DR:</b> Is that right?
<b>PT:</b> And I said it's not my weight, I've lost a couple pounds.
<b>DR:</b> You know what?  I wasn't really going to say that.  Well -
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay, thank God.
<b>DR:</b> What I was going to say it is weight related, but it is lifting a baby on your back.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> Bending over and changing diapers, these types of things are kind of new.
<b>PT:</b> I never thought about it that way.
<b>DR:</b> And, and, clearly it could provide some stress on muscles that aren't used to being used.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but this is really, I couldn't, one, one, like one day I was fine, the next day it was just pain.  Well, even when I'm with the baby, well I haven't been, oh, let me think.  Oh yeah, I was bending down, I was on the floor, but I was bending down.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, see what I'm saying now?
<b>PT:</b> Changing the diaper.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Then you're picking up, you know -
<b>PT:</b> Right, you're picking him up, the bouncy, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Bouncing, whatever.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The whole bouncy too -
<b>PT:</b> The stroller, yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I think you're going to have to pay a lot of attention to using like proper lifting techniques and stuff.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, are you going to follow up with the back doctor again or?
<b>PT:</b> Well he, he, um, I'm going to go to physical therapy, I start Thursday at 11:30, by me, [DEIDENTIFIED].  And then I don't know how long they're going to want me to go.  My dad said he had the same problem a couple years ago and he said he, he went about four months of physical therapy and then they have you use that rubber band thing to stretch and you have to do that like two or three times a day.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, but yeah, he told me, the chiropractor said to come, come on back, but see I didn't want to go to, does arthritis show on x-rays?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, it does?  I didn't know if he, if I'd have to go, I try not to go there, oh no, you probably could just, because you have to have a note probably.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know.
<b>PT:</b> What, where do you get arthritis from, just age?
<b>DR:</b> Well some of it, yeah, I mean, it's a genetic thing, and if you inherit it in -
<b>PT:</b> My parents have, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> There are, there's a couple that are the two main kinds of arthritis, one is rheumatoid, which is, you know -
<b>PT:</b> That's what [NAME OTHER] has, rheumatoid arthritis.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so you know, it's, um, rheumatologic disorder, genetically inherited.  But then you can have osteo, which is, you know, friction, usually it's the bigger joints, you know, this is where weight comes in, you know, it's heavier, it's harder -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Harder to squeeze, hips usually it's the hips.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But the hands are usually, you know, the rheumatoid -
<b>PT:</b> Oh, and then I was getting numbing in my hand.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And that, see I think my family doctor was, is wrong, but I didn't really tell him he was wrong, because he thinks it's carpal tunnel, but I said, I was trying to tell him I don't do typing -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Or computer work, or, only thing I, I'm cleaning, washing dishes, that kind of motion that, well, of course picking up the baby, but I'm not, I don't see the baby every day -
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>PT:</b> So I think -
<b>DR:</b> Where is the numbness, what's the pattern?  The whole hand?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's the whole hand, it get like it's pins and needles, and I have to like shake it like that, just my right hand, not in my left.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Would that be caused from my back?
<b>DR:</b> Could be, yeah, could be, it's through your upper back, these cervical [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> He told me to get a splint thing or whatever with the supports, but I didn't get, I'm not getting that.  He said, "See you in a couple months."
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> "See him in a month," he said.  Maybe I'll get a new family doctor.
<b>DR:</b> He's not too thorough huh?
<b>PT:</b> No, he, he is, but, but I don't know, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> Maybe some place [DEIDENTIFIED], well, he's in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I'd like to find some place on [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  It's complicated when you go in with all kinds of problems, I'd think if you'd have one -
<b>PT:</b> Well yeah, well yeah, and then plus another thing you don't see, like I needed, uh, refill my Lipitor, I don't, I don't see him on a regular basis, of course I don't know if I'm supposed to see him when I run out of Lipitor, uh, to check my blood level then?  I'll wait three months and then do it.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you can ask them.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How do you want to handle this, you know, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Once a year, six months, how ever they want to do it.
<b>PT:</b> Well, what about this sciatic nerve, now what causes that?
<b>DR:</b> Well, again, it could be trauma related, I mean that's low back and then it goes down the back of the leg.
<b>PT:</b> Not the side of the leg.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it can.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah right, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum, so -
<b>PT:</b> I wasn't getting any trauma.
<b>DR:</b> Well, but sometimes it's just the matter of sneezing or bending funny -
<b>PT:</b> Oh I see.
<b>DR:</b> Or hunching over, I mean it could be -
<b>PT:</b> What about balance, I almost tripped a couple times.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You know, it could be diaper related as well.  It could be a lot of diaper trauma here going on.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> You have to be careful, you know -
<b>PT:</b> Oh wait a minute!
<b>DR:</b> You could change the baby on a proper height table.
<b>PT:</b> When I was working with the agency -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> When they, we had, they wore diapers so we had to change them, and it's, it's waist level -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But you're still bending over.
<b>DR:</b> But not as much.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Just some common sense things to think about.  So, you're not working at all now or what?
<b>PT:</b> No, I told them to hit the door, no, no, no, they called and I asked, I mean, first, first she wanted me to do, would work as a couple, and I had to ask, I usually ask what it entails and she said, "Oh, there, that, this, feed them lunch, or breakfast," or she, there was two shifts or something, two or three hours at a time.  And I said, "Well you know, my back's okay now, but I've got my sciatic nerve thing," and she goes, "Well then I want," she goes, "Well when I, when you get okay, give us a call and then."
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So I said okay.  Changing a bed pad takes a good 15 or 20 minutes.
<b>DR:</b> Oh I'm sure of that.  Well, um -
<b>PT:</b> And I had to get up at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning.  But then I get depressed and I cry at night, not every night.
<b>DR:</b> Well you know we're at a point, maybe we ought to revisit, uh, make an increase in the, uh, Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no.
<b>DR:</b> No?
<b>PT:</b> No, last time they, it, um, made me nauseous.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sure about that?
<b>PT:</b> Yes I'm sure about it.
<b>DR:</b> Yes it is, all right.  What's interesting was it was almost a year ago, it was August.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Right, um, we could change that to a different antianxiety antidepressant if you'd like, I mean are you feeling depressed with all of this going on?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, well, would you be depressed?
<b>DR:</b> Well that's a good point, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, sort of, yeah.  Well, the walking helps, no actually, no, I take that back, I'm, I'm, I must be in la-la land, I wasn't walking, I can't walk because of my leg.  So -
<b>DR:</b> Um, how about, um, fluoxetine, have you ever taken fluoxetine, it's Prozac?
<b>PT:</b> Nope.
<b>DR:</b> Why don't we see what happens with that, uh, in place of -
<b>PT:</b> In place of what?
<b>DR:</b> The Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.  How many mg?
<b>DR:</b> It's lower.  It would be 20 mg instead of 100.  We don't have to do it, but I think it's a good idea.  It's a good medicine, it's well tolerated, it's not habit forming, it's an anti anxiety antidepressant drug, it came out in the 80s.
<b>PT:</b> I've heard of that, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's kind of a gold standard treatment in the, in the clinical trials, in fact even in the PDR and the information from the FDA there's a, you know, warning in there about weight loss, not weight gain.  It's not a weight loss pill, but you know.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  I heard some people talking about that, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, um, I think you'll find it can provide some comfort, maybe help you even with some of the, you know, the stuff you're working on with the EA groups.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And we can get it going in a dose that I think, you know, what I would do is, is just start it at 20 mg a day, and for a week, I've got some lower Zoloft to [INAUDIBLE] stop it.  What do you think [PATIENT NAME], can you do that?
<b>PT:</b> 20 mg of Prozac and 50 of Zoloft, so what are -
<b>DR:</b> That's for a week and then you stop the Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, so I have to get a pill cutting thing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> You can't just break it in half like that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you can.
<b>PT:</b> You ever try doing those?  No, see?
<b>DR:</b> Have you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Right, okay.  Uh -
<b>PT:</b> Oh and another thing I want to say, the, the family doctor gave me, and if I didn't fill, fill it, because I was going to ask you, he wanted me to get, uh, a prescription of steroids, 4 mg.
<b>DR:</b> For what?
<b>PT:</b> I guess for my back.  And I thought, I, I didn't agree with, I wanted to check with you.
<b>DR:</b> I know, do what you've got to do.
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't, I, I don't want to take it.
<b>DR:</b> Here's the thing, here's the thing, um, I'm worried about your mood cycle and if you take it, and I'm worried about, you know, weight is another issue.
<b>PT:</b> Right -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, 4 mg is a low dose.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So I think you'll probably be all right on it, but, yeah, I don't know what to say about it, those are my concerns, it's not that you can't take it, but those would be my precautions that I would advise you to monitor, okay?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think I'll take it, I'm doing fine.
<b>DR:</b> Well then you better get your -
<b>PT:</b> I should take time and I'll [INAUDIBLE].  Oh, and another thing, my, uh, my Geodon, you changed it about a couple months ago to 3 pills a day.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I, and when I got it filled I didn't notice till after I got home, and I didn't go back up there to bitch about it-
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But they, they only made this out for 2 pills at night.
<b>DR:</b> Well the plan was, um, to be taking 2, 80s and a 40, right?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't know what it was.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's what it looks like, so -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, no, but that's 3 total, right?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but they're probably, it's on 2 different scripts.
<b>PT:</b> Well they didn't give me another script, so I don't know -
<b>DR:</b> Oh no, here it is.
<b>PT:</b> No, they didn't give it, they didn't fill it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, Geodon 80, take 2, and Geodon 40 take 1.  Well if they didn't fill it, tell them to pull the script and show it to you, because it's right there on, I have a copy of it.
<b>PT:</b> All right, I'll go back there and talk to them.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they only gave you 1 of them, 1 was an 80 mg, they filled 2 of them, the other one is 40 mg [INAUDIBLE], but they do have a copy of it.
<b>PT:</b> But they never gave me that.  I never -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Just noticed that.
<b>DR:</b> Well they have a copy of the script.  It's like a, having the Xerox.
<b>PT:</b> So, I'm supposed to have 1, 40 pill and 1, 80?
<b>DR:</b> 2, 80s and 1, 40.
<b>PT:</b> 2, 80s and 1, 40, okay.  So I need the 40 pill.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, we'll switch it on over, see what happens.
<b>PT:</b> See my pictures.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.  [NAME OTHER] told me you brought the new pictures, let me see.
<b>PT:</b> About eight weeks ago.
<b>DR:</b> Those are nice, now did you take these or did you go to a photographer?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, my daughter, my daughter-in-law and my son, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good, I'll have to check that out.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's a good baby, yeah.  Just saw him Sunday for a cookout at my daughter's.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But, I figure once I get, um, all my health things in line, then I'll go work or whatever, but I'm not, not about to, because I just can't, I don't want to risk [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I did lose three pounds, did you notice that?
<b>DR:</b> That's great, I did notice that.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Well you told me, so good, so keep it up.  All right?
<b>PT:</b> So you don't think my weight has any, because you weren't going to say that were you?
<b>DR:</b> Well it's not helping matters, because -
<b>PT:</b> No it's not helping, but years ago it didn't bother me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So it happens as we age, as I've learned myself, with my own weight, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, how is your-
<b>DR:</b> It's coming along -
<b>PT:</b> Does it still bother you?
<b>DR:</b> A little bit.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> No sweat, it's coming along well.
<b>PT:</b> Do you walk with a limp?
<b>DR:</b> I try not to.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, that's what I try not to too.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well all right, good to see you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right?  We'll see how this works.  Oh, I hope it works [PATIENT NAME].  Oh yes, look at that.  Perfect!
<b>PT:</b> Oh wow!  That's excellent!
<b>DR:</b> Beautiful!  Man, that's fun!  Okay, we'll see you in a few, good luck with all of that stuff, okay?
<b>PT:</b> In a month.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
