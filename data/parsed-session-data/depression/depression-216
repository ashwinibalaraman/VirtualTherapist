BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So how have you been?
<b>PT:</b> Well, um,  in some ways I'm better and in some ways I'm kind of hardly hanging in there.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I had to quit my job at the [INAUDIBLE] restaurant
<b>DR:</b> What happened?
<b>PT:</b> It was just the stress.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It was just too much for me.  I came in there on a Thursday and I kind of had a melt down and told them I didn't think I could do 6 tables, wait on 6tables and that I thought I could only do 3, so what they did is they closed down part of my section altogether and just gave me 3 tables and I was okay but I still had to take my antianxiety medication.
<b>DR:</b> Okay
<b>PT:</b> But I was okay with the 3 tables.  Well, they need people who can take 4, 5, 6 tables to work there and so I thought about that, that happened between then and Saturday morning, I was supposed to go into work again and I just decided that I just couldn't do it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I just couldn't do it, the stress was just overtaking me.  I was having to take my antianxiety medication all the time.  I'd leave stressed, I'd be stressed while I was there, I'd come home stressed and have to take more medication, and it was just taking a toll on me.   I was having lots of IBS problems and just, just anxiety, and just messing me around and so I decided that, um, for my health that I needed to just quit that job.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I'll have to deal with the financial ramifications of that but um - 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, are you going to look for something else do you think?
<b>PT:</b> Well, what I'm doing is I've decided to join [INAUDIBLE]'s team
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Aflec insurance company
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> And so I'm working as an agent, an associate.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And so I'm doing that and that is, that is stressful because it involves doing things that you're not comfortable doing like, you know, calling people on the phone and going and seeing people at businesses and things like that but, but it's kind of incapsulated, in other words, I don't, you know, I can take a break anytime I want to.  I took an objective look at what I had done one day.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I said I spent 2 1/2 hours on the phone in my pajamas with my coffee in front of the fireplace, it was like how hard can this be, okay, you know, all I have to do is smile when I talk on the phone
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So you know, I'm trying to keep things in perspective that way.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> And you know, it's going to be a great fit for some people and some people just don't understand and they don't want to understand.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So you know.
<b>DR:</b> Is it mostly cold calling?
<b>PT:</b> Right now it is.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> The first year is a lot of cold calling and corporate drops and things like that.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Because I don't have a referral base yet.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But once I get, after a year that I've been in the business, the second year I start doing my own referrals.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good.
<b>PT:</b> And so, you know, I just have to hang tough there for the first year and build my foundation.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm committed to doing that and, um, you know, sometimes I have to take my antianxiety medication and sometimes I don't.  I've been having less of a need to take it as I'm becoming more comfortable with what I'm doing.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> So I think that's a positive thing.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> I do have nights when I finish the end of a real hectic day and I have, you know, like this happened last week, I was laying on the couch and I was just feeling waves of anxiety wash over me and I thought okay, I guess I better go take my Atenolol, so I went and took my Atenolol and it took care of that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And so the Atenolol is still working for me very nicely.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> It's non sedating, it's non habit forming, I only have to take it, I can take it as needed which is nice, I don't have to take it on a regular basis so I really like that medication.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> And like I said, it's working fine because the anxiety is systemic and so the beta blocker works really well for me.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't need to be sedated, I need to have that adrenaline stopped.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> So that's a good thing.  Um, um, what else, um, I had a really bad bout with depression on Saturday, Saturday was a really bad day for me.  I just, I felt like, now Sunday was different, okay, so it didn't last but Saturday I was back to, you know, I don't want to be here, I'm not enjoying any aspect of my life, I just, you know, I was in a bad place.
<b>DR:</b> Do you know what triggered it?
<b>PT:</b> I think the stress of the week caught up with me and, ah, you know, because it was Saturday's down time.  You know what, I don't know if you by into this idea of mine or not but I have a theory that says your body, the mental aspects of your body and the physical aspects of your body, when you're under stress will kind of go into a mode of operation that says I can endure this for whatever time I have to and then when you have your downtime, that's when all the symptoms catch up with you, because you don't have to press on.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And so you don't have to do it anymore and so that's when your body says okay I can let go now, I can be anxious, I can be depressed.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I can cry, I can, you know, rest, I can sleep, I can do all those things that I need to do to get recovered.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> So I think that's kind of what happened to me on Saturday.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And then Sunday, um, slept in, went to the late service at church and, ah, just really enjoyed being there, soaked in the, soaked in the worship time and everything was really nice and comforting.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And so, um, I felt like, I had been ministered to and I felt really good after I left church so yesterday was a much better day.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> For me but I still, you know, I still have days like Saturday and I'm just thankful that they don't go into day after day after day, so that's, that's  the part that I'm doing better.  You know, I'm still experiencing symptoms of depression but not with the frequency and so I'm happy about that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I think the Cymbalta and the Zoloft are still, um, doing good.  I just was in an overstressed condition.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And you know, that may get to be a pattern because I don't work on the weekends and so I'm going to kind of watch that and see.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> If that kind of gets to be a pattern, depending on what kind of week I've had.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh and how long have you been out of the restaurant job now, about, has it been weeks?
<b>PT:</b> It was the 27th of October is when I resigned.
<b>DR:</b> So it's a little over a month, okay, and how long have you been working for Aflec?
<b>PT:</b> Since, let's see, I talked to those guys, I talked to them on the 11th of October and that's really when I started because I had to, I started, um, that weekend, that was, I met with the district sales coordinator and the regional sales coordinator to see about, my interview with them to see if they wanted me to work with them, on the 11th of October.  On the 13th of October, I started studying for my licensing.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Because you have to be, of course, you have to be licensed.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> To sell insurance and so I am licensed for health and accident and life.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Insurance. Insurance and so I started studying and that was, that was just, you know, and all out effort to study before I even went to class.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I wanted to get as much material as I could before I even went to the license, the state licensing class which is a 2 day full day class where they, basically what they do is they help you understand what kind of information you need to know for the test and then I took the test and passed it, thank God, on the first try so that was a real but that was a real challenge for me, focus and concentration.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> It really, really wiped me out, those two weeks that I spent doing that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But that was another one of those situations where it's like, it's what I had to do and so I just, I didn't do anything else with my life, I just focused on studying and kind of ate and breathed and slept the licensing stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> For 2 weeks
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I got through the test and then the pressure was off but it did wipe me out pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Going through that but, you know, I was able to recover and it actually took me 3 or 4 days to get recovered
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I did get recovered, it just took a while.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> Let's see, sleeping, it depends on my stress level.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I can be, I can still have days where I'm absolutely exhausted, you know, got up at 3 o'clock, didn't have a nap and I'm still not ready to go to bed at 11.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> Now what I do is I take my medication and I just make myself go lay down.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Because otherwise I'll be up till, you know, if I let myself go, I'll be up till 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning just fiddling around.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah but with the medicine then you're able to get to sleep?
<b>PT:</b> With the medicine, it does make me, get me to the point where I'm able to go to sleep if I go lay down and be still, so I do that and then the problem is I don't stay asleep a lot of the time.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> I do have nights, I do have nights where I sleep through the night.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Like last night was one of them when I did sleep through the night but I got up at 6 and went back to bed at 7 because I was just exhausted.
<b>DR:</b> And you're taking the Lunesta?
<b>PT:</b> The Lunesta and the Trazodone.
<b>DR:</b> And the Trazodone?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And how many Trazodone are you taking?
<b>PT:</b> Two of them, 2 of the 100 mg tablets.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I tried to take 3 but it didn't seem to make any difference so I just stuck with the 2.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So that combination works okay most nights would you say?
<b>PT:</b> Most nights.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But I still have, again, it depends on what my level has been.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> You know, what my stress level has been, as to whether, the higher my stress level, the higher the stimulus level, the more agitated I am and the more stimulated I am and the more I have trouble going to sleep and staying asleep.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I still have to kind of manage my interactions and my energies and I've just kind of gotten to the point where I know I'm going to pay the price with this is kind of where I'm at, you know, I know if I got out, like we had, on Friday night we had a nice sit down appetizers with the district coordinator, appetizers and drinks and, you know, fun and just visiting, that kind of thing, and then we went and played pool, and um, which was a lot of fun, I like to play pool.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> No betting but I knew that when I got home that was going to pay a price for that level of activity.
<b>DR:</b> You'd be a little wired still.
<b>PT:</b> I was extremely wired, I didn't go to bed till 1:30 and I had, you know, and I didn't have a nap that day and I was, I was exhausted but I was not sleepy so that's kind of, it's weird but that's kind of what happens.  And when I wake up [PHYSICIAN NAME], it doesn't have anything to do with anything in my environment.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It's just like something on the inside of me just goes ping and I'm awake, like wide awake.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> There's no waking up and being sleepy.  You know how you normally wake up.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, yes.
<b>PT:</b> You're a little bit sleepy and you kind of, you know, it takes you maybe 10 or 15 minutes and you finally come out of the fog.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's not like that.  When I wake up, I am wide awake.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> Like I could jump out of bed and go run.
<b>DR:</b> And yet sometimes you can get back to sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I can.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I can.  What I do, I have my 30 minute rule, what I do is I'll lay there for 20 to 30 minutes and if I, if I go back to sleep it's great, I don't have to worry about it, if I cannot go back to sleep, I get up and go work on my computer.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Or read or write or something, do something because that's what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] told me.
<b>DR:</b> That's a good rule, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He said you don't want to be laying in your bed and be miserable because then you associate your bed with misery and then it'll just be worse and worse.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So he said it's better to get up and do something fun or something protective.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> With your time.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> If you can't sleep.
<b>DR:</b> That's a good rule.
<b>PT:</b> I think that's worked out really well.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  How's your appetite been?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well with my stress level being a little bit higher on a daily basis, I'm not eating a lot.  I think I've lost a few pounds.
<b>DR:</b> Do you know how much you weigh?
<b>PT:</b> I probably weigh about 185 right now.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, but I've been, you know, like I'll eat, what I have been doing here lately, like last week, is I'll eat 1 of my Balance bars for breakfast with coffee and then I'll have maybe a yogurt for lunch and then usually by evening I'll start being hungry and I'll go ahead and eat dinner.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm eating kind of light and, you know, I get full and I stop eating because I don't really have an appetite until after I start eating.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, it stimulates your appetite.
<b>PT:</b> That's kind of weird.  Like I'll feel hungry.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But I don't have the appetite so, you know, I'll look in the refrigerator and nothing kind of looks good but I'll go ahead and get me a small bowl of something and eat it and then while I'm eating, all that tastes good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And [PATIENT NAME], how tall are you?
<b>PT:</b> 5'4".
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And how's your focus and concentration, like when you were studying for the exams, are you able to focus reasonably well?
<b>PT:</b> Well, what I had to do to get through that is I had to, I would study as long as I could and then I would get sleepy and I would go take a nap and I would get up and make myself some coffee and I would study and study until my brain was in overload condition and then I'd get up and go work on a puzzle or go play a game or something and I just, my brain will kind of max out on me and maybe everybody's brain does that, you know, with that kind of intensity, um - 
<b>DR:</b> Well, with varying degrees I think.
<b>PT:</b> Right, right, my brain was kind of maxed out on me, then I'd have to just, I have to just take [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I would, so I would just come back to it and I could like, I could concentrate in spirts but I had a lot of trouble with reading through a page and having to go back and reread it because I didn't understand anything I read.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, and then I might have to go back and reread it again.  Now when I took the exam, it was horrible, my conditions for taking that exam were horrible.  I was so exhausted, so tired and so sleepy, while I was taking the exam that I had to read through every question about 3 times before I understood the question.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> And then I'd have to read through every one of the answers about that same amount of times before I could pick, make my selection.  Now thankfully they gave us a lot of time to get this test done, so even working at that slow pace, I was able to finish the exam and go back and check my answers.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I had enough time to do that and I did change some of my answers and I did pass the exam but, um, it was, it was horrible trying to take an exam under those conditions but I spent 2 weeks of being totally, um, totally stressing myself out and so, you know, everything just was kind of catching up with me so when I went in to take the exam, I was not in very good shape at all.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But that's just kind of what I have to do, I have to make that extra effort to try to understand what I'm reading, read it and if I don't get it, then I do it again.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Then I just read it again.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah, you're finding out what works it sounds like.  Let me turn this off so it won't keep beeping at me.  It sounds like you have a limited amount of time that you can stay focused and concentrate.
<b>PT:</b> Well, if I have enough time.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> To do something.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Then I can usually get it done and get it done to satisfaction.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But if my time is cut short or you give like, you give me the same amount of time you give a normal person.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I can't get, I can't get it done because it's just, I just can't stay focused and concentrate at that level.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> For an extended period of time.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I can for short bursts.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And then I have to rest and then I do a burst and then I have to rest, so that's kind of the way it goes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And [PATIENT NAME] what about, are you able to get enjoyment out of day to day activities or not?
<b>PT:</b> It varies from day to day.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> What I would say is, I would say that I don't enjoy my life but I don't hate it either, so I'm kind of neutral.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I don't, generally, now Saturday was the exception, Saturday I just didn't want to be on the face of the planet anymore but most days it's not like I feel, I don't feel that way, I don't feel like I don't want to be here anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> But I also can't say that I really, really enjoy much of what's going on either.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm kind of neutral.  I'd rather be neutral than the other way, so that's why I say, you know, better in some ways.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I can see that or perceive that as progress.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Because I'm not in a pit.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right, that's the key.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I may be standing on the edge on the pit but I'm not in the pit.
<b>DR:</b> That's good [PATIENT NAME], we don't want you in there.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to be in the pit, so I'm outside the pit which means I can go forward.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And get further away from that pit so that's what I, you know, that's what I tried, and what I do, I make myself engage with life.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I make myself do things that I don't feel like doing.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I make myself work on my computer or I'll make myself play games or I'll make myself, um, sit down and write.  I'm working on a forth book.
<b>DR:</b> Great.
<b>PT:</b> So I'll make myself sit down and write and so I kind of go through life a lot that way with making myself do things to remain engaged with life because if you're not, you're dying.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And if I 'm going to be on this planet, I want to be growing and I want to be living, I don't want to be dying.
<b>DR:</b> Good, that sounds excellent.
<b>PT:</b> So, so I'm, you know, my head is on a little bit better I think these days.
<b>DR:</b> It sounds like you're figuring out how to navigate through the stresses of life without allowing it to become overwhelming to you which is crucial.
<b>PT:</b> Most of the time.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Most of the time but I do, you know, I do have those days where I get overwhelmed and I just have, like I said, I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  
<b>PT:</b> But those are choices that I'm making and when, and you know, when it gets to be too much, I just go, I just go to bed.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I just go lay, like I have days where it's like I just need to be horizontal.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I may not sleep but I just need to be low profile, no profile.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Just, I don't want any stimulus, I want all the lights off, I want the noise, I want it to be quiet and those are times when I'm kind of at my threshold where if I do anymore I'm going to pay for it, so I just, if I can afford myself the luxury then I'll just go get low profile.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And rest.
<b>DR:</b> That sounds like a good idea, you've got to pace yourself.  Are you having any problems with any of the medications that you're aware of?
<b>PT:</b> Not that I'm aware of.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  Okay and are you doing okay with refills on everything, do you know?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I need, last time I was here I did not take any Cymbalta with me and so I need some Cymbalta.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, I just got some so that's good timing.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay, cool and, um,  depending on when we set the next appointment, I may need some more Abilify.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, I think I've some back there, let me check on that as well.
<b>PT:</b> Um, let's go ahead and set up an appointment.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> For next month.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that sounds fine.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Let's see here, were you thinking like the week of the 14th, 21st, or 28th, what works for you?
<b>PT:</b> Let's do the 28th, have you got some time on that day?
<b>DR:</b> I do, that afternoon is pretty open.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> We can do 1 o'clock again if you want, is that a good time?  Or we can do it later than that or I have earlier like 10 or 10:30 or 1 or 2 or 3.
<b>PT:</b> Let's do 1 o'clock again.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you want to borrow a pen or pencil?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So 1 p m.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> On the 28th of January.
<b>DR:</b> Right, do you want a card also?
<b>PT:</b> No, I've got it written down.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Here so I'm okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Just make sure we're on the same day, the 28th.
<b>DR:</b> Yep, the 28th at 1 o'clock.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, that sounds excellent, so let me get you some Cymbalta and Abilify then
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Let's see, so I'm counting weeks, we're in December now, it's going to be about 8 weeks.
<b>PT:</b> It'll be, let me see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8.
<b>DR:</b> In about 8 weeks [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, 8 weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you know if you have any Abilify left, do you have a couple weeks worth?
<b>PT:</b> I have a couple weeks worth.
<b>DR:</b> Okay great
<b>PT:</b> I'm pretty sure.
<b>DR:</b> I have 10's and 5's here.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, that works, I'll just put then in a little prescription thing.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And you know, take a pink one and a blue one.
<b>DR:</b> And if you get low, call me.  The rep brings my samples, I think he's coming back in this month so.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> We've had a change in reps.
<b>PT:</b> I'll tell you what, you're just saving me with these samples.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I'm glad to do it.
<b>PT:</b> I'm glad that you can do it because I could not be able to afford it, especially with being on commission now.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And you know, not having a regular job, so I don't have that steady income but I still have my disability and we'll see how much money I make with this business 
<b>DR:</b> You say it's straight commission now.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, straight commission.
<b>DR:</b> That's rough to get started, it takes a while.
<b>PT:</b> It is, it's just, it's real different, it's, I guess [NAME OTHER] and I are kind of both at the same place.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Where, because she's in this business too and so we can encourage one another.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> And so that's a good thing and share what we know and that kind of stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But, um, she and I have both decided that in order to, you know, we have dreams that we want to realize.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And we have purposes in our life that we want to make good on and we can't do that working for somebody else, we need to do something like what we're doing now where we can, where we don't have any caps on our income level.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> That we can produce at.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And so, you know, it's hard work, it's good work, it's ethical work.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> You know, it's good solid work but, um,  it is hard
<b>DR:</b> Especially when you're getting started, hopefully, it will get easier with time
<b>PT:</b> Getting started and it will get easier with time so we're going to, we're both committed to just hanging in there and doing, establishing these good habits.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Good work habits and getting, you know, getting our businesses going.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> So that's a good thing.
<b>DR:</b> It is a good thing.  Well [PATIENT NAME] if you need anything before next time, give me a call.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> We're going to be out of town visiting family that week of Christmas and the first couple days of January.
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> So I'll leave the name of the on call doctor on my telephone message if you have any questions.
<b>PT:</b> If I have to call you.
<b>DR:</b> Or need anything.
<b>PT:</b> I should be okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to make a trip to Texas for Christmas.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good.
<b>PT:</b> So that's going to be my Christmas present to get to see my mom.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> And my aunts and uncles and cousins.
<b>DR:</b> Well that should be nice
<b>PT:</b> And all that good stuff, yeah it should be nice, so I'm going to make a trip too
<b>DR:</b> Good, well drive safely.
<b>PT:</b> You too.
