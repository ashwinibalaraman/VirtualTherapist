BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, how you feeling?
<b>PT:</b> A lot better than yesterday. 
<b>DR:</b> Good, what do you think turned things around, do you know?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I’ll tell you what I did…
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And it’s probably not something that I should have done, but, so I took the two Seroquel and I also went ahead and took two Klonopins.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Because after I woke up from the Seroquel I was hungry, but I was still very, very edgy. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> And so, normally, I’ve only been taking the Klonopin once in the morning, I haven’t needed it at night.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> And so that really helped, when I took two. 
<b>DR:</b> So you took of them about what time?
<b>PT:</b> I would say around six thirty. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I woke up at around nine thirty, I fell back to sleep after I ate and I took the Klonopin and I woke up at nine thirty, took my regular meds and woke up this morning, and regular meds being, I just take, I haven’t been taking the Zyprexa anymore. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, how long ago did you stop it?
<b>PT:</b> Two weeks ago, or you know, whenever we last met. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that was about two weeks ago, so you stopped it after that appointment?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I thought it was 5 mg that you know…
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I hadn’t experienced a change in anything. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and [PATIENT NAME] so you just have to be real careful because I think sometimes, before when you stopped this it was a few weeks later and then you started feeling crumby again.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> So if you start feeling bad let me know, will you? Because I don’t want you to go backwards. 
<b>PT:</b> Right. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. So you think taking those two Klonopin last night made the difference?
<b>PT:</b> It really calmed me down. At least, I was very panicky because I was depressed and anxious over it. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> It went from depression to feeling, you know, hopeless, self hatred.
<b>DR:</b> All right. 
<b>PT:</b> Then I felt so guilty because I really couldn’t function with the kids and [NAME OTHER] had to take over and the kids were in moods and I felt really bad that he had that on top of him. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, this was just last night? Your [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well I was just kind of riddled with, you name it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Packed with guilt, I don’t know. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, okay, but today you don’t feel so bad?
<b>PT:</b> No, I took the Depakote last night, that’s 2000 mg and I think I took 100 mg of the Seroquel. I usually take four of those.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Four of the 25.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> And then I just went to bed. 
<b>DR:</b> Did you take Ambien also?
<b>PT:</b> No, I haven’t needed Ambien since we met, two weeks. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I haven’t had to take it at all. 
<b>DR:</b> And you’re sleeping fine without it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, sometimes I fall asleep and I’m worried that I forgot to take my medicine, I’m falling asleep just naturally.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that’s great. 
<b>PT:</b> It’s really nice. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> I’m not as groggy in the morning. 
<b>DR:</b> Good. 
<b>PT:</b> Um, with the Adderall? 
<b>DR:</b> Yes. 
<b>PT:</b> I’ve been doing fine just taking 30. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I haven’t had any more food cravings. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good. 
<b>PT:</b> At all. 
<b>DR:</b> So you take 30 in the morning and that’s it? 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think, I’ve had, I had one, you know, one day a week I would say that I’ve taken 45, where I just felt particularly groggy for some reason. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay and I’m sorry, you said how often? Maybe one day a week?
<b>PT:</b> Once a week. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Normally, I only need 30. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> And I don’t need any more than that because my appetite has kind of stabilized. I don’t know how that happened. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, and you’re off the Zyprexa. The Zyprexa could have been…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Triggering some of that possibly. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I really, I’m eating three times a day and I actually have an appetite 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Which is, I don’t remember the last time I actually had an appetite for food. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, okay. So your appetite’s normal, though, at this point, you would say?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> And how’s your weight doing, do you know?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, it’s the same. I haven’t weighed myself, but all of my clothes fit exactly the same. I don’t feel anything different at all.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So it’s great. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good. 
<b>PT:</b> I’m not having cravings for carbs at all. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Um…
<b>DR:</b> Good. 
<b>PT:</b> I think there was one time after I saw you that I took 60. 
<b>DR:</b> Of the Adderall?
<b>PT:</b> Of the Adderall because the day before I just binged on a ridiculous amount of food.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I ended up getting really, really sick. 
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> So [NAME OTHER] suggested well maybe tomorrow you should take two and see how that goes or because I had taken 45 that day.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> But then I stopped the Zyprexa and I never had it again. 
<b>DR:</b> I am suspicious that that was maybe what was causing the cravings without the... 
<b>PT:</b> You know, I’m hungry at like five or six and then I might be hungry at nine for like a snack, like a piece of bread or something or something light…
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But I’m eating actually better now then I ever have in my life. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, good. 
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know what it is. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that’s encouraging though. How’s your energy, excuse me, energy level during the day?
<b>PT:</b> It’s good. I mean, I have a couple of days a week where I’m just kind of sluggish and I don’t really know why?
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Like that would be the day that I take 45 and I make an extra half in the afternoon because I’m thinking well this is weird, you know, I feel kind of, you know, sluggish or something, but I haven’t needed to do that more than once a week.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> At all. 
<b>DR:</b> And you’re not having days where your energy is excessively high?
<b>PT:</b> No. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, or… 
<b>PT:</b> When I took the 60, I didn’t sleep for like two days. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh boy. Yeah, that may be a little too much for your size. 
<b>PT:</b> It was too much, but…
<b>DR:</b> How much do you weigh, you think?
<b>PT:</b> I think I probably weigh about [DEIDENTIFIED]. 
<b>DR:</b> So 60 would be absolutely the maximum we want to go to and if we can…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I haven’t done that again. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> And I don’t think I ever will. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. So most days you’re sleeping okay if you don’t take that much?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, even like on the day that I take 45, I still will, you know, like around nine o’clock, nine or ten, I’ll get sleepy. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, excellent, and that’s without Ambien. 
<b>PT:</b> And I sleep straight through until like seven or seven thirty. 
<b>DR:</b> Good. 
<b>PT:</b> And I, the only times I have problems, are if [NAME OTHER] and I go out at night and I don’t take my meds until like eleven, then I don’t wake up until like nine. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay, because you’re groggy in the morning, yeah, that’s understandable. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that’s my problem, so I haven’t figured out what to do about that except that he’s just going to have to get up with the kids because I… 
<b>DR:</b> Probably. 
<b>PT:</b> I just can’t. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, if you take medicine that late at night it will be hard. Any problems with racing thoughts, your mind going very fast?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> When I took that 60 I did.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I would try to nap and it was just like my head was going, it wasn’t going a hundred miles an hour, but it was one thought after another. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> It wasn’t a manic process where I really do have racing thoughts, I can’t explain the difference.
<b>DR:</b> Still different. 
<b>PT:</b> The racing thoughts are actually racing like it’s faster, like my mind is producing them faster. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Whereas this is just my mind was not still. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I would think of one thing and then automatically think of another thing and then think of that one for five minutes. 
<b>DR:</b> So you would jump from one thing to another?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah…
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But I would jump for longer periods of time. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Now with manic I would jump through things every thirty seconds. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, I understand. 
<b>PT:</b> Or a minute, and then I was onto something else and then like a minute later I was onto something else. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, what about, thinking about manic symptoms, any excessive spending, increased sex drive? Driving faster?
<b>PT:</b> Nothing. 
<b>DR:</b> Nothing, okay, okay. What about any panic attacks lately?
<b>PT:</b> Except for yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> When you got real anxious, before you took the extra Klonopin. 
<b>PT:</b> And I got really anxious. It started when I got my period. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay and did it feel more like depression or anxiety or both? 
<b>PT:</b> It felt more like anxiety. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> It started on Monday night and Tuesday. What really developed last Tuesday was just full-fledged anxiety. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. And that’s when you got your period, was last Monday or Tuesday?
<b>PT:</b> Last Monday or Tuesday. And I started the pill and that was, you know, hopefully that’s supposed to regulate my estrogen. 
<b>DR:</b> And when was that that you started the pill?
<b>PT:</b> I started on Monday. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> So… 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I also got my period again a week early, which I don’t know what’s going on. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, that could be a lot of things, even the Lexapro can throw off your cycle. 
<b>PT:</b> I’m having hot flashes, too?
<b>DR:</b> Lexapro can do that also. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> So that could be the Lexapro. If the Effexor works well, we might even back off Lexapro to see if it will get rid of the hot flashes and your period might become more regular and being on the pill may help that too?
<b>PT:</b> I’m supposed to wait, you know, two months before I really see the effects of the pill. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> But it started with anxiety throughout the week and then by, I would say, Friday I was kind of getting depressed a little bit and then Saturday night, Saturday during the day I was fine. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But at night all of a sudden I got extremely irritable.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Which is not like me to get, really mad.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I don’t typically have bursts of anger. 
<b>DR:</b> How long did that last for?
<b>PT:</b> A few hours.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And what I was thinking was that I actually hadn’t eaten in a few hours. I felt better after I ate, I wasn’t as irritable. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> So I don’t know if it was a blood sugar problem or… 
<b>DR:</b> It’s possible it could have been. 
<b>PT:</b> When I finally ate I just was like, thank God. 
<b>DR:</b> And you felt better. 
<b>PT:</b> I really needed food lately. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay and the Adderall may be suppressing your appetite and your blood sugar may be dropping. So, we’ll have to watch that. Some people also have to force themselves to eat a little bit, at least. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I’m actually, I’m hungry three times a day, I have to eat. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that’s good. 
<b>PT:</b> But once I eat, I’m done. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> But, I got irritable and then I went from irritable to just depressed. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Literally depressed. 
<b>DR:</b> Huh? Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I didn’t want to get out of the car, I didn’t want to go anywhere, I wanted to go home. I laid in bed and started crying and then in the morning we went to church, it got worse during church, there were a few things about the sermon that kind of triggered me. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> And then there was a potluck after church. I had a really hard time talking to people. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, you just weren’t in a good place. 
<b>PT:</b> I was trying so hard to smile and laugh and I just was dying to get out of there.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> And then as soon as I got home I just went to bed. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Well, [PATIENT NAME], I think there are so many variables right now, too, I mean you started the pill, stopped Zyprexa. The Klonopin, you may be needing a little bit more of it, it sounds like just from the effects from yesterday, probably what we ought to do is decide how much Klonopin for you take. There are a couple options…
<b>PT:</b> I think the one in the morning and one at night wasn’t doing anything anymore, I had to just, I went ahead and I was just like I’m just going to take two.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and you were just taking, were you taking one twice a day or were you taking one in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> I used to take one twice a day.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And then I stopped and started taking just one in the morning. 
<b>DR:</b> Right. 
<b>PT:</b> Because I didn’t need it at night anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Right. 
<b>PT:</b> And then that was going well for a few weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I was trying to kind of wean myself off of that. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, it maybe you just needed a little bit more because of the other changes, with the pill and all.
<b>PT:</b> Right. 
<b>DR:</b> So what we might do is still stick with one in the morning, but have you, give you the option if you need at night to go ahead and take one or two at night, too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> But not do it everyday because if you do it everyday your body’s going get used to it. 
<b>PT:</b> Exactly. 
<b>DR:</b> But if you don’t do it everyday and you don’t need it everyday, when you do take it, it will be more effective. 
<b>PT:</b> Right. 
<b>DR:</b> Does that make sense?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Wound you be okay with that?
<b>PT:</b> That’s fine. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I’ll probably need a new prescription then. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Because my prescription is two by [DATE] and I haven’t refilled it because I haven’t been taking it, you know?
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, okay, let me get you a new one then, with the directions to… 
<b>PT:</b> The Klonopin really helped settle me down. 
<b>DR:</b> Good. 
<b>PT:</b> That was, but I wasn’t having, I didn’t think it was the Klonopin because I wasn’t having tremors, I wasn’t overly anxious, I was more depressed. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> As far as like the withdrawal that I experienced from Klonopin in the past. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. It may not have…
<b>PT:</b> I didn’t feel that way. 
<b>DR:</b> It may not have been that. It may have been more, again, just all the changes you’re going through right, you know, with getting on the estrogen, the birth control pills, the Zyprexa leaving your system, which takes about a week and then another week to feel the effects of that. 
<b>PT:</b> Do you think I should get tested like for hormones or?
<b>DR:</b> Well, I mean, you could. I mean your OB…
<b>PT:</b> I mean I’m pretty young, but I just feel like
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you’re real young, how old are you?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you’re really young, I mean it would be very unusual for you to be like perimenopausal or anything like that. 
<b>PT:</b> I’m just wondering. I’ve never had my period affect me this way.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Ever. To the point of, I mean I’ve been irritable and moody, but never like this.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well sometimes your hormones can be normal, but you still can be affected by your period too and for some women to be on certain kinds of medicines, like Lexapro, usually one that helps, it will reduce sort of the PMS type symptoms. 
<b>PT:</b> Really?
<b>DR:</b> But you’re already on that, so…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and the week before my period I was perfectly fine, I was great, it was… 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so it’s not premenstrual, it’s menstrual changes, okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I was debating getting my thyroid checked, I was trying to figure out what…
<b>DR:</b> Well, I think right now, I mean, we can certainly do that too, we might want to give it a few weeks or even a month to kind of get you, see if we can you evened out a little bit. 
<b>PT:</b> See if the pill kind of 
<b>DR:</b> If the pill starts to again regulate things a little bit. Also, let’s go ahead and stay on the higher dose of Effexor if that’s okay with you?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> It will just give you a little bit more support from an antidepressant standpoint. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> And it also has antianxiety properties, Effexor does. So, it could help with both of those, which would mean in the long run you might be able to use less Klonopin and maybe eventually less Lexapro too. Is there anything new particularly stressful going on right now?
<b>PT:</b> No, not at all actually. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I’m making some changes.
<b>DR:</b> What kind of changes?
<b>PT:</b> I’m taking [NAME OTHER] out of daycare.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I’m keeping him home, having a nanny come stay with me. I’ll be with him in the morning and then she’ll come at noon until like six or seven, you know, I’ll have plenty of help 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good. 
<b>PT:</b> So it’s not like I’m shifting gears so severely like just staying home with the kids. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. 
<b>PT:</b> Because I didn’t want to do that. I didn’t think that was a good idea. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> To go from not being with them at all during the day to being with them everyday and then getting overwhelmed. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that would be another big change.
<b>PT:</b> And that’s really good. We’re going to save money on that and… 
<b>DR:</b> Good. 
<b>PT:</b> I’m leaving to [DEIDENTIFIED] tomorrow. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you are?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, with [NAME OTHER], my daughter. 
<b>DR:</b> For how long?
<b>PT:</b> For about a week. 
<b>DR:</b> Just going to visit family?
<b>PT:</b> Visit my parents and visit my friends. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Just kind of wanted to get out of the snow and get out from the cold. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> They paid for the tickets and, you know, it’s just a week. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, are you gonna be staying with your parents?
<b>PT:</b> I’ll be staying with my parents, [NAME OTHER] will be sleeping with me. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and that’s always a little stressful being… 
<b>PT:</b> It is, they’re very close to her, so it will be easy for me to kind of sneak out and… 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, good, go see friends and things.
<b>PT:</b> Go visit my friends and stuff. 
<b>DR:</b> Good. 
<b>PT:</b> She’s extremely close to them. 
<b>DR:</b> Are you still looking for work in [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Yes and in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I haven’t found anything yet. 
<b>DR:</b> And your house is still on the market?
<b>PT:</b> Still on the market. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> So, you know, we are in limbo.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> And, to some extent, but I’m working at the [DEIDENTIFIED] just volunteering part-time. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> So I go there two or three times a week for like four hours and help out. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good, so you’re staying plenty busy. 
<b>PT:</b> Well, I’m trying to make sure that I get out of the house. 
<b>DR:</b> Good, I think that’s important. 
<b>PT:</b> It’s something, and I’m trying to stay away from work. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Trying? It sounds like it’s hard. 
<b>PT:</b> It is hard. It is hard. I just got off the phone with a recruiter and I had to pass off a job to somebody else. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> It’s very hard for me to say no to work because that’s all I’ve ever done. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well hopefully… 
<b>PT:</b> It’s pretty much tied to who I am.
<b>DR:</b> Well, [PATIENT NAME], my hope is that, it doesn’t mean you’ll never work, maybe you can just take some time off just to kind of get stabilized. I mean, do you want to go back to work at some point then too?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I’m thinking of taking some classes. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> To kind of compliment some of the work 
<b>DR:</b> Good, because<b> </b> you know of one things about bipolar disorder is even when a person is not going through new changes at the time, it still takes months for people to kind of stabilize. 
<b>PT:</b> I don’t think I could take, like a full time job right now. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. 
<b>PT:</b> I would be afraid that I probably wouldn’t be able to function. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, the stress would start to cause, yeah, more problems and it might cause you to have mood swings or who knows. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But overall, things are good. 
<b>DR:</b> Good. 
<b>PT:</b> So…
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it sounds like your doing better, that’s encouraging. 
<b>PT:</b> Except for this week and it had to be with my period, it just, it failed, you know? 
<b>DR:</b> Well, and again it could be your period, it could be starting the estrogen that can cause mood changes in woman and could also be coming of Zyprexa, it could be a combination of the three, okay. 
<b>PT:</b> And it is synthetic estrogen you know so, right? You know I think… 
<b>DR:</b> You know, and again, I don’t know enough about estrogens to know, I know some prefer naturals and some prefer synthetic. 
<b>PT:</b> I think he does natural estrogen when he prescribes for me right now.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well I would trust…
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said at my age the pill would be the best thing. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Well what do you think about leaving the medicines the way they are with the increased dose of Effexor, off the Zyprexa and then using the extra Klonopin at night if you need it? Let you go to Miami and relax for a week, get away from the cold and snow and maybe check back in when you get back and see how things are going? Does that sound all right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I would like to check in when I get back. The sooner the better.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don’t want to wait. 
<b>DR:</b> I agree. Let’s see, what works here. Anything else you want to talk about?
<b>PT:</b> With the Seroquel... 
<b>DR:</b> Yes. 
<b>PT:</b> Is 100 mg doing something to me? I know that’s pretty low, but is that just helping me sleep or?
<b>DR:</b> Well, it could be doing a couple things, you know, it helps with sleep, it can help with anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> I know it’s a small dose. 
<b>DR:</b> It is a small dose, but I have some folks that take it as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder and they only need like a 100 mg.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Or sometimes even a little bit less, so, I mean the only way to know if it’s doing anything or not would be stop it and see if things get worse, which I don’t want to do. 
<b>PT:</b> Like if I took, I took two during the day yesterday, does that mean I can only take two at night? 
<b>DR:</b> No. 
<b>PT:</b> Can I go ahead and take 100 at night…
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Even if I took a little bit more during the day for anxiety?
<b>DR:</b> For anxiety? Yes, you certainly could take…
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Another, I mean, you’re not anywhere near the maximum dose so you could take another couple during the day if you need it
<b>PT:</b> That’s what I wasn’t sure. I went ahead and took the full dose because I thought, well I had the day I’m just going to call it a day, but I wasn’t sure if that was too much, or…
<b>DR:</b> No it’s not, the only risk is, again, it might make you tired. But, no, you can take a couple during the day if you need them for anxiety, okay? That’s not a problem at all. 
<b>PT:</b> What happens if I miss a dose?
<b>DR:</b> Of Seroquel?
<b>PT:</b> Of Seroquel and my Depakote?
<b>DR:</b> Probably nothing from one dose. Most people don’t notice a big difference. If you start missing two or three then your blood level could drop enough that you could start having mood swings again. 
<b>PT:</b> Because I’ve had days where, I haven’t missed any, but I’ve had days where I’ve fallen asleep.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And forgotten to take it and then woke up in time to take it. 
<b>DR:</b> It’s good if you don’t miss a dose, but [PATIENT NAME] don’t panic if you miss a day because for most people, missing one day doesn’t cause them to feel any differently, it’s only if they miss two or three days in a week, then they start noticing, yeah I’m starting to feel a little bit more labile and their mood more up and down.
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> So. 
<b>PT:</b> I was just wondering. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that’s a good question. So, let’s see, you’re leaving when?
<b>PT:</b> Tomorrow. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, tomorrow and you’ll be gone until about…
<b>PT:</b> About Monday.
<b>DR:</b> Monday, [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>DR:</b> So if we could get together maybe sometime next week it would be good. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> What about, oh my goodness, would three o’clock next Friday work, which is [DATE]?
<b>PT:</b> Yes. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. I’ll put it on a card for you. Do you want a card?
<b>PT:</b> You know what I’m going to, I found out that this has an organizer. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, man, does everything doesn’t it?
<b>PT:</b> I guess so. Okay, so [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> Yes. 
<b>PT:</b> At what time?
<b>DR:</b> At 3 p.m. 
<b>PT:</b> I know it’s faster if you write the card, but…
<b>DR:</b> That’s okay. 
<b>PT:</b> But I lose the card. 
<b>DR:</b> I understand that’s not a problem. 
<b>PT:</b> This has been really working for me. 
<b>DR:</b> Good. Okay, [PATIENT NAME], so the only thing I’m a little nervous about is I think last time I stopped the Zyprexa you started having a little bit more fluctuation in your mood. 
<b>PT:</b> Yes. 
<b>DR:</b> I’m hoping the Depakote and Seroquel will prevent that from happening.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> But even if you’re in [DEIDENTIFIED] and you start feeling, you know, worse you might… 
<b>PT:</b> I’ll bring it with me. 
<b>DR:</b> That’s fine or call me. Yeah, you might take it with you as a back-up and then call me if you have any problems, but, I mean if you have one bad day, I mean we all can have a bad day. 
<b>PT:</b> Isn’t 5 mg pretty low?
<b>DR:</b> It’s a pretty low dose, but it’s enough for some people. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh. 
<b>DR:</b> So, I’m hoping you won’t need it, but if you do, I don’t want you to slip backwards. So…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If you have any problems just call me okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then, whoops…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I hope I don’t need it because if that helped with my appetite it’s just been night and day. 
<b>DR:</b> And I think that’s probably one that is doing it, that’s the one that’s notorious for increasing appetite. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it’s just quite the change. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well good. Here’s the prescription for Clonazepam, Klonopin I wrote for 90. 
<b>PT:</b> I need the one for Effexor too. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yes. Let me get you, let me write for the 75 mg. 
<b>PT:</b> And I’m running out of 190, but I can refill that.
<b>DR:</b> The 150s?
<b>PT:</b> I mean the 150s. 
<b>DR:</b> Why don’t I just write for the 75s and write for three of them a day. I think it will be cheaper probably than taking one. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Let’s see, are yours going through insurance or are you paying for it on your own?
<b>PT:</b> We have to do [DEIDENTIFIED] so eventually it… 
<b>DR:</b> It will be insurance. 
<b>PT:</b> But I do have to pay for it on my own right now. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, I think it’s cheaper probably if we go with the 75s…
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And do three a day then if we do two prescriptions for one, the 150 and one for 75s. 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh. Is it possible that the Effexor helped this quickly?
<b>DR:</b> I doubt it, not usually with one dose. 
<b>PT:</b> I wonder what it was?
<b>DR:</b> Maybe the Klonopin, it might have been it. 
<b>PT:</b> Hmm?
<b>DR:</b> It’s kind of broke the cycle. 
<b>PT:</b> It’s interesting, that’s the only thing that…
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that’s the only difference really…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, maybe, it’s just a, I was going to say a good night’s rest, but you’ve been sleeping okay. 
<b>PT:</b> No, I’ve been sleeping great. I can’t complain. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> All right?
<b>PT:</b> Great. 
<b>DR:</b> So, have a great trip. 
<b>PT:</b> Thank you. 
<b>DR:</b> Like I said, if you need anything call me. 
<b>PT:</b> All right. 
<b>DR:</b> Enjoy the warm. All right. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay [PHYSICIAN NAME], good to see you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay. Bye-bye.
