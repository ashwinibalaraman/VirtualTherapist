Transcript:
<b>DR:</b> I'm going to review the forms and, uh, talk to you.  So, how are you doing today?
<b>PT:</b> Things haven't been real good for me.
<b>DR:</b> What is going on?
<b>PT:</b> You started me on this for my fibromyalgia.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  Yes, uh, we started, yes, the Savella.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] —
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> My pain doctor, started me on that.
<b>DR:</b> He did?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  So you, you used the first day —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just started it.
<b>DR:</b> And when, you started yesterday, a couple of days ago?
<b>PT:</b> Yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  How is it going with it?
<b>PT:</b> So far, I don't have any allergic reaction.  Remember we started, tried, uh, I don't know if it was you —
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah it was.  We tried the other one, the first one that came out for fibromyalgia and my tongue swelled up.
<b>DR:</b> Was it Lyrica?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Lyrica.
<b>PT:</b> Remember when we tried that, my tongue swelled up?
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I guess this is a trial, and there's only a couple of doctors that gave it to me.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  It's a, it's a treatment for fibromyalgia.  It's, uh, Savella.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> And, uh, you have to do the starter kit.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And it's four weeks the starter kit, is that right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> But, but what we are doing for your bipolar disorder is still the same?
<b>PT:</b> Well —
<b>DR:</b> Is that right?
<b>PT:</b> Let me talk to you about that.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> I think, I've been not able to get up and do anything.  I want to.  It's everything this says.  I want to get up and do it, but I can't.  I'm depressed.  I'm nothing like I used to be with my bipolar.  I'm not manic.  I'm depressed.
<b>DR:</b> More depressed?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  It's like my bipolar has done an about face on me.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's like I'm more depressive than I am manic anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I don't have strength.  I don't have energy.  I, I'm getting my migraines back.  I'm, it's not about pain.  It's about, I mean my fibromyalgia and all that is about pain, but this is not about pain.  This is about depression.
<b>DR:</b> Depression.
<b>PT:</b> And I don't know, I don't know what's going on.  I don't know how to deal with that.  I've never had to be depressed.  I've never been depressed.
<b>DR:</b> When, when you say depressed, I mean —
<b>PT:</b> I mean depressed like I don't care.  I don't care.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't care if the dishes are dirty.  I don't care if there's laundry.  I don't care.  I don't care anymore.  I don't care.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I, my son, I just became a grandma again.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> So he sent me a ticket.  I'm going to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] and see my kids, which I haven't seen my first one yet.  So I'm going [DATE] for five days.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And it's like I should be more excited.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But, um, I weigh like 185 pounds.  I've never weighed that much in my entire life.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I have no energy.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you eating more?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Just not active?
<b>PT:</b> No.  And I don't want to be, I mean I do want to be.  I want to get up and do the laundry and clean the kitchen and make my house look like it used to —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I don't care.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't care.
<b>DR:</b> Have you been taking your meds every day?
<b>PT:</b> I take them faithfully.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I am one not to mess with my meds ever.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And do you, uh —
<b>PT:</b> But my bipolar isn't, it's opposite.  It's not, I have no manic in me whatsoever.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  And you know that bipolar has these two components, the mania and the depression and sometimes when you get older, you would have more depressive episodes.
<b>PT:</b> Now I read that.
<b>DR:</b> You read that.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And, but I don't know how to deal with that.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I've never had depression, never in my life.
<b>DR:</b> And you, and you have been depressed for more, would you say like more than —
<b>PT:</b> Three months.
<b>DR:</b> For three months now.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I was depressed when I was here the last time.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.
<b>PT:</b> And then I thought I was getting better, and I did my flowers.  I planted my flowers, and I went to [NAME OTHER] and then I stopped going to [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> For therapy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I went to her like three times, and then she —
<b>DR:</b> How did the sessions —
<b>PT:</b> Acted like I was done.
<b>DR:</b> How, how did the sessions go?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I started, like I was doing good, you know.  I mean I would feel good.  The last day I went to her, it was like I felt great, and then she seemed like I was done going to her, and I said oh please don't tell me I'm done.  And then I just never went back.  And it was like I didn't know what to do when I went there.  I don't know what to make things right.  I don't know what to do to make things right, to feel better, to want to get up.  I have no energy.  If I just had some energy.  I just don't have any.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  How is your sleep going?  Right now, you, do you take Lunesta?
<b>PT:</b> No.  My sleep stinks.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't take Lunesta.  I take, uh, what's the other one?
<b>DR:</b> Uh —
<b>PT:</b> You changed it.
<b>DR:</b> Temazepam.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and that's a good —
<b>DR:</b> So, temazepam has worked for sleep —
<b>PT:</b> That's a good —
<b>DR:</b> Better than, uh —
<b>PT:</b> It's a good sleeping pill, you know, but my sleep is not worth nothing.
<b>DR:</b> So you're not sleeping well still?
<b>PT:</b> Huh?
<b>DR:</b> A little bit better with temazepam but not that —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, the temazepam is a good sleeper.  It is a good sleeper.  I think it's just me.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know, because I like the temazepam for sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> But —
<b>DR:</b> And you are, you still take the Paxil?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Sixty mg pill.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I take one in the morning —
<b>DR:</b> And then the —
<b>PT:</b> And one at night.
<b>DR:</b> The, the, the Topamax.
<b>PT:</b> Topamax, I take two at night and one in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> Of the 100 mg?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you take, you take Paxil 30 in the morning and then another 30 at night?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I just don't, I have no energy, doc.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I don't.
<b>DR:</b> Have you been smoking any marijuana?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I will with my headaches.  I just need my, only at night though because I don't, I don't even want to be around anybody if I do that, you know.  That's like something that is just, I don't want to be around somebody if I do that, you know.  I mean I don't do that for like recreation or, I do that for, if I'm really hurting or I can't sleep, I will do that.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> But very seldom I do that, but I do it, you know.  I mean it seems to help and like anything else, it seems to help a little, so I try it.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't do drugs.  I don't drink.  I mean —
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not, I'm not, I don't abuse my medication.  What is going on?  I mean I'm a good girl with everything.  I follow everything I'm supposed to, and I don't feel right and I'm scared.  I never felt depressed.  I don't know what to do with it.
<b>DR:</b> Did you try Seroquel XR?
<b>PT:</b> What is that?
<b>DR:</b> Seroquel?  It's, it's a, it's a medication that was approved recently for, uh, bipolar depression.
<b>PT:</b> You're the only one that deals with my bipolar.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So what, what I think we can do, because we are trying several things.  I would think that if we add Seroquel XR 300 mg at bedtime, maybe three or four hours before your bedtime, that might help your bipolar depression and might help you sleep too.
<b>PT:</b> It's not going to make me more tired, right?
<b>DR:</b> If you take it, let's say if you wake up, uh, at 6:00 in the morning, if you take it at 6:00 in the evening, the, the, the, the peak of it will, will be when you're asleep.  So I mean most, the sedation will go while you're asleep.  Then when you wake up, you are kind of off this part of the medication, and it might help sleep too, uh, but because we have been trying.  You have been on the Topamax for some time.  You have been on the Paxil for some time.  We didn't make any changes like that.
<b>PT:</b> And those were fine when I was, I felt manic or when I —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I was manic, but even my other doctors say, you know, I don't see you as manic.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I don't see that in you.
<b>DR:</b> You know, you are right.  I mean for the next few sessions, you have been more depressed than —
<b>PT:</b> And I don't see —
<b>DR:</b> Than manic.
<b>PT:</b> Any manic in me.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I, I mean it's not even peeking through.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> It's not, there's nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't get angry.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I don't, I'm passive.  I'm, well I've always been kind of passive, but I mean I have no anxiety.  I do have anxiety, but it's, it's depressive anxiety, you know.  I'm depressed.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> It's not.
<b>DR:</b> Have you been suicidal?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I just don't care one way or another.
<b>DR:</b> But are you still excited —
<b>PT:</b> In fact, I'm tired of this whole mess.
<b>DR:</b> Are you still excited about going to [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b> I'm excited.  I'm just —
<b>DR:</b> Looking forward to it too?
<b>PT:</b> I am, but I'm —
<b>DR:</b> Is it your first time to [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> No, but I haven't seen my son in six years.
<b>DR:</b> Six years.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So that by itself is, um, a good thing.
<b>PT:</b> It's kind of scary.
<b>DR:</b> And you are a grandma.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Yeah, well seven times I'm a grandma.
<b>DR:</b> Very good.
<b>PT:</b> But I have never seen my boys, my son's boys.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's got another boy.
<b>DR:</b> Are you excited about the grandkids?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  My grandkids always excite me.
<b>DR:</b> Of course.  Good.  So you still have things to look forward to.  So, how about this?  What I'm going to do, uh, [PATIENT NAME] is, uh, give you, give you the trial of the Seroquel XR 300 mg.
<b>PT:</b> Well, will it be okay with that drug too?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It shouldn't, it should not, yeah, you can still take the Savella.  It's, it's, that's for fibromyalgia.  That's something different, but let's do in addition or, in, in addition to what you are on now, let's do the Seroquel XR.  If you, just to let you know, if you notice that you are sedated or started to have any weight gain with it, I know that you don't like weight gain.
<b>PT:</b> I can't gain any more weight.
<b>DR:</b> Right, but you are on Topamax.  So, the good thing, the Topamax can balance this.
<b>PT:</b> But it's not.  What's going on —
<b>DR:</b> The activity.
<b>PT:</b> This isn't doing anything.
<b>DR:</b> To, to continue with, you need to be physically active and you have to watch your diet.
<b>PT:</b> I do.
<b>DR:</b> But you are —
<b>PT:</b> In fact, I'm trying —
<b>DR:</b> Are you physically —
<b>PT:</b> In fact, I've been in the, I had to go to the emergency room for a migraine, and they said that my, they're checking now, my [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is checking now because they said my, my protein, I have trouble with my protein.  [NAME OTHER] cooks and let me tell you something, you can't not have low protein in my house —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> For cooking because [NAME OTHER] cooks.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's wonderful food, just wonderful food and it's all high protein.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And so they're checking me for all that stuff now, and because it came up that I had low protein and my doctor said why didn't they keep you then?  That's dangerous.  Well, I don't know.  Why is he asking me that?  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Why is he asking me why?  I don't know why they do anything.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But they ran a bunch of blood tests and —
<b>DR:</b> Did it go well?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, but I haven't gotten them back yet, but he's going to, um, I'm going to have them sent to you and, I've only got three doctors.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I've got you.
<b>DR:</b> Who's, who's your primary doctor now?
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Same one.  I've only, I never change you guys.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I've only got you three doctors.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> And I never change, and I never mess with my medicine, and I don't know.  It's killing me just gaining all this weight.  It's just, and not the weight gain.  It's just I have no energy even to do the laundry.
<b>DR:</b> When you, when you are depressed, you go through this.  What you are seeing is [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I don't know how to be depressed.  I've never been like this.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I never.  You want me to sign it?
<b>DR:</b> Yes, for the Seroquel, just write your name here, sign here.
<b>PT:</b> Write it?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, write your name and sign.
<b>PT:</b> And then sign here?
<b>DR:</b> Yes, please.  We want to thank you very much today.  I think you helped us a lot to understand what's going on with bipolar because I mean really that, that's important.
<b>PT:</b> I just don't know, and you know, I'm scared to death of bipolar.  [CRYING].  I hate it, and I've never felt, what's so awful is I never felt depressive before.  I really haven't.  I never cried so much.
<b>DR:</b> I know.
<b>PT:</b> I have never cried so much in my life ever.  I never thought I used to have tears.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Because I never cried, and now it's like I can't make them go away, and then I had to go yesterday and get my Order of Protection.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.  Is he going to be out of jail?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> That will put you under a lot of stress too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I'm, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Did they give you the Order of Protection?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they gave it to me.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Let's check your weight.
<b>PT:</b> It's 185 pounds.  [CRYING].
<b>DR:</b> So your weight today is 185.
<b>PT:</b> I've never in my life weighed that much ever.
<b>DR:</b> You gained three pounds over, but over six months.  You gained three pounds over six months, so.  Yeah.  Okay, let's, let's do this.  I'm going to give you samples of the Seroquel XR 300 mg at bedtime.  Use it for a month and then, uh, I'll see you again in about eight weeks or so.  Stay in touch with your case manager.
<b>PT:</b> I never can.
<b>DR:</b> Why not?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  Because I call him and —
<b>DR:</b> Who is your case manager?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].  I call him and I guess he's just too busy.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  I'll talk to [NAME OTHER] too.
<b>PT:</b> But I should make an appointment with [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> I think that's really important especially around the time that, uh, this person is going to be out of prison, so you wouldn't be kind of by yourself.  Um —
<b>PT:</b> I don't have any friends anymore.  I've alienated myself terribly.  I don't know why.  I have my faraway friends.
<b>DR:</b> You still have your boyfriend.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Isn't that right?
<b>PT:</b> He asked me to marry him.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, so you have good news here.  You have good news.  You are keeping the good news till the end.  [LAUGHING].  So, do you have a date for the marriage?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I'm scared.  My dad said —
<b>DR:</b> So, did you say yes or no?
<b>PT:</b> I told him yes.
<b>DR:</b> So you said yes.  Okay, so that's a good story.
<b>PT:</b> My dad told me to get a cigar band.
<b>DR:</b> What, what —
<b>PT:</b> I told him not until I had a ring and my dad said get a cigar band.  My dad loves him.
<b>DR:</b> How long have you been together?
<b>PT:</b> Three years.
<b>DR:</b> Three.  So that's good enough.  Do you know him enough to get married?
<b>PT:</b> I know that he takes good care of me.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So he's, he's, he's supportive.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't think —
<b>DR:</b> Is he going, is he going to [DEIDENTIFIED] with you to be with —
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You are you going to be by yourself.
<b>PT:</b> We're going to drive later out to see, his daughter lives in, um, Washington and my other grandchildren are in, um, Utah.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> So we're going to go to Utah and then drive up through [DEIDENTIFIED] and see my brother and my, my grandkids and then go see his daughter and she's in Washington.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And then come back the first of the year or something, just take a break and go.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> That's what he wants to do.  That sounds good to me.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Just to get out of here.  I mean I just, I, my best friend, my very best friend, we've been friends for 50 years —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And she lives far away.  I don't really have any friends here.  [CRYING].  [NAME OTHER] is the only friend I have anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I just can't sit and listen to other people —
<b>DR:</b> Problems.
<b>PT:</b> Anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And that was what I did for so long, but I just, they just sit and complain.  That's all they do.  They never talk about anything fun, you know.  My, we go out on the boat.
<b>DR:</b> Do you go to the river?
<b>PT:</b> I have a pontoon boat.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Good.  How often do you go with your boat?
<b>PT:</b> Well, um, as often as we can.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> You know, gas was a lot there for a while, but my mom just had surgery.  So I like taking my mom out and she couldn't go out, but my niece came up last, a couple of weeks ago and we took them out.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> She had, and I raised my niece, so it was fun watching her have fun.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But I just don't, I don't have any friends anymore and I hate that.  When I try to make friends with someone, they either turn out to be a drug addict or a drunk, and I can't handle either one.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I just won't be around, I can't help it.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Well, you had a chance today.  All right?  Would you, uh, would you be willing to start it and let's, let's go to [NAME OTHER]'s office.
<b>PT:</b> Now, is that going to, how is it going to make me feel?
<b>DR:</b> It should work on the bipolar depression.  That's, that's, that's [INAUDIBLE] and may help you sleep at night.
<b>PT:</b> That would be a concept.
<b>DR:</b> So that, that's, that's what we are hoping for.
<b>PT:</b> I don't sleep past 4:00.
<b>DR:</b> So, that, that's what we are, what we are hoping for.  If you notice any side effects with it, just let me know.  Call us and then we'll take care of it, but I think it's time to make some changes.  You have been depressed for some time, and we kept the same regime for some time.  So, I think —
<b>PT:</b> So, change my other ones?
<b>DR:</b> No, no.  We'll, we'll keep, if you respond well to the Seroquel, we may take you off the other, like the [INAUDIBLE] and one of the others, but —
<b>PT:</b> But don't take me off my Topamax.
<b>DR:</b> That's why —
<b>PT:</b> Because that's the one —
<b>DR:</b> I, I know because that's why you, you, you like the, you like the Topamax for some time.  It's kept your weight and —
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I got thin when I was working —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> When I was walking.
<b>DR:</b> Right and I think you need to go back to physical activities and you need to really get back to exercise.  You have to.
<b>PT:</b> I've tried that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe this will help too.
<b>DR:</b> If you, if your, your pain is going to go down, definitely you are going to do more.  I mean I think that's, uh, I mean if we combine —
<b>PT:</b> This is all experimental, so.
<b>DR:</b> It's not experimental.  It's been approved.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  You said it's been approved —
<b>DR:</b> It's new.
<b>PT:</b> But he's just experimenting on me.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you have been very helpful today.  Thank you for agreeing to do this, thank you very much.
<b>PT:</b> Well, thank you for helping me.
<b>DR:</b> Give this, give this to [NAME OTHER] and she needs to make an appointment.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you for helping me.
<b>DR:</b> Thank you.
