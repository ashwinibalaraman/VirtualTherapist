<b>DR:</b>	Uh, [PATIENT NAME] you were telling me that you've been depressed and uh, having more problems since I saw you last with uh, sadness and, all right, why don't you describe what happened at work with crying spells and things.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I [INAUDIBLE] I went to the table and there was a messed up order, she told me I had a really bad hearing problem, she told me egg whites instead of egg lites and I give her egg lites, and I was like all right I'll go back and fix it and she was just like, I don't want them.  So I was like all right, I went back and [INAUDIBLE] the order and I was like, okay.  I came back and I was like here's your omelet anyway and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	You're working in a restaurant?  Or—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I work at [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you messed up the order and then she uh, the customer was upset and criticized you.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you break down after that or?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah shortly after that.  But that didn't phase me, I just, I could care less.
<b>DR:</b>	What's been going on though?  Have you been having, I know you mentioned uh, well we thought we were recording this but we weren't, that you were having sleeping problems.  You haven't slept in several days, um, your mom gave you a sleeping pill though—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And that helped a little bit.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, just a little bit.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  You also told me that you were having increasing headaches over the past 8 months, and uh, I know I gave you something for migraine, but I think I would like you to have an MRI to see what's causing them since they seem to be coming more frequent.  Um, you'll call mom and see if you're covered on her insurance, right, for that.  I would like to start some anti—depressant with you though and I don't think you have been on this one, it's called Pristiq.  And uh, I'd, I'll give you a prescription for that and we'll try it and see if we can bring up your mood.  The only thing uh, with it is that—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh no, she gave me an Ultracet.
<b>DR:</b>	She gave you an Ultracet?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah that put me right, went to sleep.
<b>DR:</b>	For sleep.  All right.
<b>PT:</b>	She gave me an Ultracet and uh a half of uh generic OxyContin.  It's, I don't know it's like—
<b>DR:</b>	Your mother gave you that?  Why would she give you that?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I can't sleep.  It's—
<b>DR:</b>	Those are not medications for sleep.
<b>PT:</b>	It put, it knocked me right out [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	I bet it did, they're controlled substance and narcotic.
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].  That was some good sleep.
<b>DR:</b>	I bet.
<b>PT:</b>	I've been sick for like a week and I was like please give me something to make me go to sleep.
<b>DR:</b>	I'd prefer you not to do that, so I will give you um, a sleeping pill.  I have some samples of like Lunesta and also Ambien that I'll give you to try them.  You told me that you've been keeping yourself up for the job though by taking uh, what were those, Power—
<b>PT:</b>	Energy shots.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and what are they namely?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know, it was like caffeine, and they don't have guava they have uh different, different types, types of um soda I guess it'd be or somethings really, really fizzy and you can take the whole shot and it'll give you 7 to 8 hours of energy or.
<b>DR:</b>	And you've been having uh, I guess increasing problems with sadness, crying spells?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	How about any problem with your concentration and memory?
<b>PT:</b>	Memory yes, concentration not so much.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  Any feelings of irritability or
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, definitely.
<b>DR:</b>	You mentioned also um you're feeling guilty over what kind of things, your brother?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	He's a sufferer for mild depression?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Also he has a drug habit you said.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	He has ADHD and um, excessive compulsive.
<b>DR:</b>	Obsessive compulsive disorder?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Probably taking the wrong kind of medications, and you mentioned that he had—
<b>PT:</b>	He was prescribed [INAUDIBLE] and I can't remember the other one.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't believe it.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, well let's start some Pristiq, I'll give you um, I'll give you uh card so the copays are reduced.  I'll give you a 2 week supply of it so you can try it.  Take it with food because I understand there's some nausea associated with some people and it will go away, it's transient, so just take it with food in the morning, and let's see how it works.  And you also I think wanted to go on home by an instruction for school again right this year?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You weren't comfortable with that?  Okay, we'll fill out the forms for that.  Anything else happening to you?
<b>PT:</b>	Mm, not much, besides my [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well you do um fill out these participation forms, you said that they should mail you at [DEIDENTIFIED].  Where is that located?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].  And do you have a uh, a zip there?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's the same as [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Any other thoughts, questions?
<b>PT:</b>	There probably is but I can't remember.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, I want to see you within a month and uh, I have a vacation coming up so I'll try to get you in for a med check before I go away.  Call me and let me know how the Pristiq is working, if it works a little bit but not a lot, just let me know and I'll try to increase it before I go away.  Okay?  All right.  You take care.
