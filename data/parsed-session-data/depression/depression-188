BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay and this is all blind to who it is, they don't know who you are or who I am.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> They're just interested in what goes on.  Um, okay, I saw you, oh we stopped everything.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we stopped everything [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> We stopped everything and that was a year ago or almost a year ago.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That was [DATE], so let's go back to that moment.  Can you believe it's been a whole year?
<b>PT:</b> I know.  It surprises me.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> A lot of stress over [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Oh my gosh.
<b>DR:</b> A lot of work.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> But it's finished.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's finished.
<b>DR:</b> A lot of work.  Your appetite is okay, you're sleeping with the Ativan 0.5, your energy is good, self esteem good, not suicidal, not irritable, not sad, not anxious, concentration fine, efficient, you thought you were in full solid remission and since you were doing so well, we stopped the Topamax which was the final piece of it.  We had actually stopped the Lexapro a year before that so this was the final bit of it.  We stopped the, uh, Topamax is a mood stabilizer and an appetite suppressant and, you know, blah, blah, blah.  We kept you on Ativan [INAUDIBLE].  All right, how has the year been?
<b>PT:</b> The year has been fine in a lot of ways in that I had my Lap-Band surgery and [INAUDIBLE] and I've lost 70 pounds. 
<b>DR:</b> Congratulations. 
<b>PT:</b> And so self esteem is good.   People have told me, you look so good, I don't recognize you, that all makes me feel very good.  I continue to have some, we have a really huge project at work and I have some anxiety from that but I feel that I'm doing pretty well but my life is so tied up with [NAME OTHER]'s, she's just been having a heck of a time [INAUDIBLE] since the beginning of this year.
<b>DR:</b> All right and as you know, I've been somewhat involved, you know, I've certainly been in touch with her.  Let's hold that for a moment and let me just collect my data.
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> To make sure that we're on the same page about you doing well.  In general, your mood is okay?
<b>PT:</b> In general, yeah, in the last month I've had some, yknow, some times when I was so anxious but [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> You get into a state?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Anxiety is about her health?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Going downhill and you having to live without her.  
<b>PT:</b> Huh?
<b>DR:</b> And you losing her?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean is that what the anxiety is about?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we just about lost her a couple of weeks ago and so yeah, it adds to the anxiety and my anxiety for her and her state of mind.  She's in a terrible state and so I find myself walking home from visiting her in the hospital and I'm so depressed.
<b>DR:</b> And then how long did that last?
<b>PT:</b> It was, it kinda lasted for two weeks but, like I said, she's getting better so I'm getting better.
<b>DR:</b> But during those two weeks, you were pretty sad most of the day most days? 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You were in a state.
<b>PT:</b> Either sad or in a state of frustration and anxiety and not being able to, feeling that I had a whole lot of coping to do with the whole medical establishment and not knowing how to, to some extent, it was just [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And trying to be as supportive as you could while, yknow -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Managing the doctors and, yknow -
<b>PT:</b> Going back and forth between hospital and home and now she's in [DEIDENTIFIED] and -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, she's back here?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's [INAUDIBLE].  And getting home making sure that my mom took the dog, so just kind of overwhelming there for a while, it's settled down a little bit now.
<b>DR:</b> When did it settle down?
<b>PT:</b> When she got, she was in [DEIDENTIFIED] for a week, then she had an emergency [INAUDIBLE] blood counts, gallbladder rupture and now she's back at [DEIDENTIFIED] and things are better.  They've got her in a private room.  They fixed her up with a bed she can operate herself but they [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> Why did her gallbladder rupture?
<b>PT:</b> Gallstones apparently are frequently a result of rapid weight loss and also run in families.  My mother had her gallbladder out and I had mine out last October because the doctor told me [INAUDIBLE], it was being activated by rapid weight loss, [NAME OTHER] has also lost 100 pounds and so she had -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] it burst, that's -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she was having a little fever, a little, yknow, they were, she had a whole lot of Lovenox shots, to transfer Coumadin to Lovenox for her foot surgery and they, she had so many in one place they made hematomas that were really painful so she was feeling terrible pain and nausea and she, her temperature was a little elevated but they were [INAUDIBLE] antibiotics from the surgery on her foot so it was just kind of -
<b>DR:</b> Crept up.
<b>PT:</b> Crept up without anybody realizing it [INAUDIBLE] and so -
<b>DR:</b> Which is why it burst.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so they got her back to [DEIDENTIFIED] where things started to happen really fast, like intense it happened really fast, once they got her back to the hospital, I've never seen anybody in the emergency room get tests done that fast and we've gone to the emergency room several times. And so -
<b>DR:</b> Well, there's a triage system.  She was -
<b>PT:</b> She was -
<b>DR:</b> Emergent, an emergency.
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> It's nice to know they can when -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they really did, I was impressed and so now she has a drain that she has to have for about six weeks and lots more antibiotics and then hopefully they can take it out without giving her a big abdominal incision to cope with while she also dealing with this external fixator.
<b>DR:</b> The incision up here shouldn't be as bad as down there.
<b>PT:</b> No but -
<b>DR:</b> Blood supply is flowing better.
<b>PT:</b> But in terms of the kind of exercises she's having to do with this 20 pound thing on her foot, we think it's 15 or 20 pounds, we don't know but it's horrible.
<b>DR:</b> It's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so it's been very, she had her foot surgery on [DATE] so we've just been in crisis mode for a while.  This past week, she's been, they brought her back to [DEIDENTIFIED], she's now been there for a week but it's been -
<b>DR:</b> All right, so of course, you're so enmeshed with her or attached to her -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That it's hard for your mood to not be [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And to -
<b>PT:</b> I've never seen her in such a state.  The day that they moved her the first time from the hospital to [DEIDENTIFIED] and they told her, the social worker told her that she was going to be in a private room and then told me that she wasn't, I'm here to tell her that I'm not going to be part of anybody who's tell her lies, so I told her that she wasn't going to be in a private room and she [INAUDIBLE], I have never ever seen her like that.  It scared me and upset me and [INAUDIBLE] how to cope and she's saying [INAUDIBLE] nobody tells me the truth and she was sobbing and sobbing and then when she got into the rehab place and started going way downhill while I was trying, I was trying to advocate for her and, you know, say she's in a lot of pain, a lot of pain, and trying to talk with the social worker there, the nurse, and the doctor there kind of wasn't very receptive.  He is now.  Oh boy are they paying attention to her now.
<b>DR:</b> Why, because they on their watch she got that sick -
<b>PT:</b> Because she had an emergency on their watch, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And so -
<b>PT:</b> And so now the doctor is -
<b>DR:</b> It counts against them if, right.
<b>PT:</b> So he's being much more solicitous and I think they're being a lot more responsive to her health, so I'm a lot, I'm a lot happier now that she's in a frame of mind where she can cope with it now.  If they put her back in a semi private room, I'll think she won't be so anxiety stricken about having to deal with everything she's having to deal with and then somebody else's personality that she couldn't get away from.
<b>DR:</b> Right and she's such a people pleaser that she would feel compelled to [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's probably just overwhelming to her to have to engage someone.
<b>PT:</b> And when they sent her back to [DEIDENTIFIED] for her emergency stay which was about a week, she had a roommate which was 101 and lay in her bed telling [NAME OTHER], I'm allergic to metal, I'm allergic to metal and [NAME OTHER] has a great metal thing attached to her leg and so she was really having a lot of roommate problems.
<b>DR:</b> Well she got a real psycho on that one.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So she's doing better now that she's back in rehab is in a semi private room, has met her next door neighbor up there who has actually gone through the same thing and has had the fixator taken off and she's not allowed to put any weight on her foot yet but -
<b>DR:</b> You know, there was a moment a few months ago when things were looking good, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The weight had come off and you were, yknow, forward looking and -
<b>PT:</b> Well then she got that ulcer on the sole of her left foot that wouldn't heal and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] did surgery on it and, yknow, to try to fix things up with the Charcot foot and it just wouldn't heal and they waited to let that heal which it is doing, just to do all this bone reconstruction [INAUDIBLE], and so they've got, they managed to get her out of the bed and into a wheelchair.  I think it still takes two people to and when she was finishing her emergency stay in [DEIDENTIFIED] her foot surgeon said well you're going home right, you're not going back to, she was thinking that we were going to get twenty four hour care at home and [NAME OTHER] was so anxious to do that.
<b>DR:</b> She didn't want to go back to the rehab?
<b>PT:</b> Right and then the gallbladder surgeon there and the insurance company all said you have got to go to rehab, you cannot go home so that launched her back into the depths of despair again so she's gotten better -
<b>DR:</b> They were right though, she could not, you know -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I didn't know how we were going to cope.
<b>DR:</b> It would have overwhelmed you.  [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was very worried about that but I was so worried about her frame of mind because she just really -
<b>DR:</b> They pulled her off her meds, I think, too.
<b>PT:</b> They, that was one thing that they did at [DEIDENTIFIED], that they apparently, Serzone is harder to get than Wellbutrin, so she was on the Wellbutrin but she wasn't on the Serzone and -
<b>DR:</b> It affected her mood.
<b>PT:</b> It did and I don't know quite what they were doing with the Coumadin and the Lovenox.  They seemed to give her the Lovenox for a very long time before they, and that was part of the problem, the pain and so I just, they didn't fill me with confidence that first week there but now they're doing much better by her.  So -
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> But somewhere fairly early in all this was when I called in my, oh my, I can't cope with this frame of mind, we're both doing better.
<b>DR:</b> So it seems reasonably normal.  Yknow, things happen, like people die, broken hearts, you know, life happens and people fall into a state but people with mood disorders, sometimes the state persists beyond where it should persist so we know you have a touch of a mood disorder and we know you've had a rough time lately.  We have to see whether the state that you fell into is persistent in a depressed kind of way, so would you say you're back to normal mood wise?
<b>PT:</b> It fluctuates.
<b>DR:</b> Meaning that what percent of the day would you say?  Fifty percent?
<b>PT:</b> Maybe a little less than Fifty percent.  I felt like I was able to concentrate at work today.  There've been just a couple of week there when I was just totally lost at work.
<b>DR:</b> When you were in the throws.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But the real question is, are you digging out of it?
<b>PT:</b> I think I am, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Are you able to get pleasure?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, mostly from my dog.
<b>DR:</b> You enjoy the dog.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do you go for walks?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do anything else that you enjoy?
<b>PT:</b> Right now, my time is very taken up with -
<b>DR:</b> Well, do you watch TV, do you read?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I watch TV and read a book, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You do and do you get pleasure?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> When you're with her, do you get a few laughs?
<b>PT:</b> I try for that, yes, I've been reading her funny books.
<b>DR:</b> You're able, I mean do you ever get a belly laugh?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes the dog will cause a belly laugh, sometimes [NAME OTHER] will cause a belly laugh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you have the capacity.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You can enjoy things.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> What's your appetite like?
<b>PT:</b> My appetite is weird because of my Lap Band, lots and lots of, I've been having a lot of episodes of regurgitation from that because the anxiety makes my stomach tighten up.
<b>DR:</b> So how anxious have you been?
<b>PT:</b> Well, over [NAME OTHER] quite a lot, so it's been -
<b>DR:</b> So you've been living in an anxious state?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Like most of the day you've been -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I find like -
<b>DR:</b> Knots in your stomach.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so it makes eating difficult.
<b>DR:</b> And are you digging out of that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think so.
<b>DR:</b> Have you been using any Ativan?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have.
<b>DR:</b> And it helps?
<b>PT:</b> It helps, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The appetite is low because you're worked up.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm worked up and I have physical restraint there.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping?
<b>PT:</b> With the help of Ativan but otherwise I -
<b>DR:</b> Do you take Ativan every night?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, a little, one little one.
<b>DR:</b> And you get to sleep, you stay asleep and you wake up when you need to?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I tend to take quite a bit of Dramamine also -
<b>DR:</b> Why is that?
<b>PT:</b> Because it helps the sick stomach feeling, I don't know what ingredient in it is the one that helps but it -
<b>DR:</b> Any suicidal thinking?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?
<b>PT:</b> Not hopeless but sometimes helpless having to deal with stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Overwhelmed?
<b>PT:</b> On the short term, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Mostly about her?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Fortunately, we're not doing anything like [DEIDENTIFIED] right now.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So
<b>DR:</b> How is work going?  Things had been unstable there.
<b>PT:</b> We're doing okay.  This year we made up all the big polar bears for the [DEIDENTIFIED] company and that was a nice start to the year because [DEIDENTIFIED] has decided to, for economic reasons, to take down their set which they always kept up all year round and move to a different floor of the studio building and all of that means that we're not producing season three of [DEIDENTIFIED] this year, we're going to do seasons thirty nine and forty next year, so that means our production schedule is a little lighter this year  and it's making it look like, is our shop going to make money, we're looking for outside projects to kinda [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So they contract to you for the production and so you definitely have the contract for next year.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we're going to be brutally busy next year.
<b>DR:</b> Right and that'll be fine so you won't have to hustle for work.
<b>PT:</b> Right, but for this year.
<b>DR:</b> This year, you've got to keep -
<b>PT:</b> Private -
<b>DR:</b> Unless you fire people or give people a temporary leave.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so we may get to that point later in the summer.
<b>DR:</b> When is the next season, when does the next season start?
<b>PT:</b> We start actually taping in February, so we start in preproduction right after Christmas.
<b>DR:</b> You've got to fill up now until Christmas?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and we've got -
<b>DR:</b> And you guys are not that busy.
<b>PT:</b> We've got one big almost Christmas spectacular that was two weeks of taping in July.
<b>DR:</b> And there's work to do through the taping or do you kind of get everyone ready and then -
<b>PT:</b> We get everyone ready and then a couple of people will be working on the set dealing with, uh we have some other smaller projects that we can keep the people who are still left in the workshop busy with for, like that will kind of dry up by September.
<b>DR:</b> There will be a few months that the bosses will have to suck it up.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And pay people.  They shouldn't curse people who take their vacations at that time then -
<b>PT:</b> Right, yeah, that's something I desperately need to do is take a vacation.
<b>DR:</b> Are you able to?
<b>PT:</b> I just, I always want to take my vacation with [NAME OTHER], so this, while [NAME OTHER] is in the hospital and the rehab might be a time when I can take a vacation in terms of not going to work everyday but it wouldn't be where I'd go anywhere.  
<b>DR:</b> It wouldn't be a fun vacation -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, 'cause I'd just be hanging out and coming up here.  I had stopped accruing vacation years ago because I never managed to take it, something always happens.  yknow, we make a plan to do something -
<b>DR:</b> You're a great employee.
<b>PT:</b> To do something and she'd get sick again, so 
<b>DR:</b> Well you come at a tough moment because you clearly fell into a state.
<b>PT:</b> I did.
<b>DR:</b> And you clearly, the trajectory is you coming out of it, but yknow, you have a style where you minimize a little bit and I wonder if you really are coming out of it.  I wonder if you need some help getting out of it.
<b>PT:</b> That's why I'm here.
<b>DR:</b> Well, have you made your decision that you'd like some help medication wise or would you want to give it a little more time?
<b>PT:</b> Would you go back to the Lexapro again?
<b>DR:</b> We can go to anything.
<b>PT:</b> Because it seems to -
<b>DR:</b> Lexapro helped when you were on it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, it definitely did.
<b>DR:</b> Because, how do I put this delicately, because her health problems are not finished, it would probably be advisable for your brain not to be so vulnerable to -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> As you have to grapple with this, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And I'm not saying she's going to die.  I'm saying that -
<b>PT:</b> But you know, I know she could because she got close, that first week she was in [DEIDENTIFIED] and was just going downhill and she was so nauseated she couldn't eat, she was, yknow, she's lactose intolerant, they brought her a meal with lactose in it and it made her sick.  Then they had her on a liquid diet.  I was trying to give her water in a cup with a straw and she could just barely suck on the straw.
<b>DR:</b> That was a bad traumatic memory and it looks like she's turned the corner -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And she's doing okay and we're all going to hope for the best but she's got serious medical problems and this is very stressful on you both.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's not the time to tough it out.  For someone with a depressive illness and a vulnerability, this is time for the armor to be up and for you not to be so vulnerable.
<b>PT:</b> I would agree with that and that was when I felt myself going down and just kind of walking around I'm so depressed.  I thought I'd better call [PHYSICIAN NAME], this is not good for me.
<b>DR:</b> Well and so by going on medicine now, we're not saying that you're not coming out of it and wouldn't come out of it, we're almost not treating the state you're in right now, that's not why I'm giving you medicine, I'm giving you medicine because we want to make you less vulnerable to going into these states -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> At least for the next few months, or six months or a year, or however long because it's probably in your best interest.  So yknow we don't need to reinvent the wheel really.  Now you went off the, around January '06 you went off the Lexapro.  You had a good run.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Your mood was okay through most of this.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And it's only in the setting of these massive stressors that you fall into the state.  I think, you know, you were on 20 for a while but then the last six months or so you were on 10.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> I think we can go back to 10 and see how you do.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And if we need to, we'll push it up to 20.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You like Lexapro, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was fine.
<b>DR:</b> It was fine, nothing, no problem.
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't recall having side effects.
<b>DR:</b> You've got all these fancy medicines, it's always fun to use different new exciting things but if something worked, we might as well just go back to it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't recall any -
<b>DR:</b> Stick with a winner.
<b>PT:</b> Any uh side effects of any kind or anything like that.
<b>DR:</b> Let's say partial remission of your depression, not all the way there.  And so, and this one, this will really nudge you back into normal mode.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But most importantly prevent the next one.
<b>PT:</b> Okay that's good, I like that.  I was hating feeling so totally at sea at work for a couple of weeks, it just, yknow, overwhelmed with [NAME OTHER] and her problems, I was totally letting work go and I felt so bad for my colleagues and all that, just dropping balls everywhere and didn't like that.  And so -
<b>DR:</b> Were you able to concentrate?  Were you able to get work done?
<b>PT:</b> Not for a couple of weeks there.
<b>DR:</b> And a lot of your work is kind of hands on stuff so at least if you have a task in front of you, Well, now does it require intensive concentration?
<b>PT:</b> It depends on what the task is.
<b>DR:</b> So you push aside those -
<b>PT:</b> Some brainless stuff, okay, somebody's got to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That's what we call occupational therapy, yknow, there is a field of occupational therapy where they, yknow, in psych and for stroke victims, and people come in and they kind of do very -
<b>PT:</b> They've got [NAME OTHER] knitting -
<b>DR:</b> Knitting, all that stuff, and it seems to work, I don't know, it gets the brain distracted, I don't know what the right way to think about it but it's good stuff, yknow.  Yknow, your whole job on some level is occupational therapy, right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> In a hands on -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah but I'm really not good at is the people confrontation part of it.  I'm supposed to be the boss, that's supposed to be part of my job.
<b>DR:</b> Are you bad at managing people?
<b>PT:</b> Managing people.
<b>DR:</b> Firing.
<b>PT:</b> Telling them when they're really doing a rotten job or even telling them often enough when they're doing a great job.
<b>DR:</b> Do you need Ativan?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, definitely.
<b>DR:</b> And do you want me to write the prescription for 20 mg of the Lexapro and you break in half or just stick with the 10's.
<b>PT:</b> 10's would be fine.
<b>DR:</b> One a day of the 10's.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that would be fine.  I know [NAME OTHER] is feeling, they will give her one Ativan a day.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and the doctor at [DEIDENTIFIED] said, oh you can take more than that but at the rehab place, they've only been dispensing one.
<b>DR:</b> Well that's -
<b>PT:</b> She wants contraband.
<b>DR:</b> Oh so you want to give her, slip her some?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right, well, I'll give you, I just wrote a prescription for the patient who was here before you.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, too bad, the patient probably won't like that.
<b>DR:</b> What'll I do?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] telephone numbers.
<b>DR:</b> I've got to find one.
<b>PT:</b> Pharmacy number.
<b>DR:</b> Well maybe [NAME OTHER] wrote out another one.  I'll just leave this out here, let someone else deal with it.  I guess she'll call.    I gave her samples for a week so there's time.
<b>PT:</b> This is samples for -
<b>DR:</b> These are three weeks.  Those are three weeks of samples so -
<b>PT:</b> Great.
<b>DR:</b> So you have time to get this filled.
<b>PT:</b> Get this filled, all right.
<b>DR:</b> Lexapro, well actually by then, we'll know whether we want to go up to 20.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay. 
<b>DR:</b> So if you do, yknow, call me if things aren't quite right yet.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And if we decide to go to 20, just remind us to call in a new prescription -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So you won't use this one, you'll use the new one for 20.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But this one I'm writing for 10 mg.
<b>PT:</b> All right.  Part of [NAME OTHER]'s anxiety is being afraid people are going to drop her.  She's not supposed to put any weight on her left foot at all, getting her out of bed and moving around and everything is so hard because she's supposed to hold her foot out in front and hold herself up either on a walker or on parallel bars and then hop on her other foot and she also had surgery on her other foot.  She had a pin put in one of her toes and that's her right foot which is, for now, her good foot because the one where she had the big amputation of her toe, so she's just really afraid about it.
