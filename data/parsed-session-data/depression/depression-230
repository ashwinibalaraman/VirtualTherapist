BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Thank you, I appreciate it.  Have a seat.  Well, how can I be of help?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I guess it's, uh, kind of been a long time coming.  Um, I've been kind of thinking about this for a few years off and on.  Um, I just think it's kind of reached a point as far as, I guess I'll start at the beginning.  Um, just my overall behavior and feelings, um, of just, I don't know if it's unhappiness, but I think it's, uh, difficulty being happy, um, and—
<b>DR:</b>	How old are you now?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm, I just, I'll be [AGE] at the end of next month.
<b>DR:</b>	And when did this start?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, up for debate.  I imagine my wife says it's been a while.  Um, I've noticed probably over the last couple of years maybe.  I have 3 boys.  Um—
<b>DR:</b>	How old are they?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, [AGE], [AGE], and [AGE].  So I think when we had the last one things kind of really ramped up as far as stress and trying to figure out, you know, the, the odd kind of one, you know.  You can't just, you take one, I'll take one kind of thing, um, and, uh, it's made me rather short.  You know, like, uh, with, with everything really as far as, you know, now I need to get things done and, um, you know, my patience was never really great.  Uh, it's gone to zero, and, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	Easily angry?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, you know, and I just, I overreact and then, you know, however long it is.  Sometimes and then once I'm upset, then it just goes and goes and goes and goes you know, and it's just for no good reason.  I just, you know, myself, I just keep that going and going.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, but that's not all the time.  Um, other times, you know, once I kind of cool down, then I can see it and maybe, you know, approach it a different way.  Say, you know, I've yelled at one of the kids.  You know, later I can go back and go hey, you know, I'm sorry about that and then go about it a different way, probably the way I should have done it from the start.  Um, and that's, uh, more of the, the norm than the exception now, my first reaction being the incorrect one, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Is there triggers and you don't sleep the night before?  Do you drink alcohol?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, not, not really.  Um, there are periods that they seem to, uh, uh, there are times where I have difficulty sleeping if, if that's, um, if that's the case, it'll usually happen a couple of days in a row, but, you know, 3 days maybe where I'll go to sleep just fine.  The middle of the night I'll wake up and have trouble going back to sleep.  Um, usually up for, you know, a couple of hours maybe and then I can go back and go back to sleep later.
<b>DR:</b>	How often does that occur?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, it comes and goes.  Uh, once every, I mean if I had to, you know, kind of take an average over the course of a year, maybe once every other month.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, is it increasing in frequency?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, no.  Um, I haven't, the other night I, I, I didn't sleep real well, but, um, that was kind of an isolated case.  So that was just the one night, um.
<b>DR:</b>	What do you think about when you're up like that?
<b>PT:</b>	Everything, you know, uh, work or things I need to do around the house, basically to do lists really.  Cause, you know, I guess if I had to boil it all down to one thing and kind of put one thing on it, it's like to—do list, you know, you kind of go over it if you've got something going on at work.  You might have a new idea.  You know, I might have a new idea or I might, okay I got to do this.  I got to remember to do that.
<b>DR:</b>	What do you do?  What kind of work?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm a sales manager.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, so how long have you been with this company?
<b>PT:</b>	A long time, 15 years.
<b>DR:</b>	And you like work?
<b>PT:</b>	Eh, yeah, I mean, yeah, there are worse places to be.  Um, I'm not where I'd like to be.  I don't mean that company wise, but I mean, you know, as far—
<b>DR:</b>	With the company?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I have goals.  I, I might not change positions, but, um, I've only been, uh, the manager for my department for a couple of years.  So there, it was pretty much a mess when I took it over, and there are places I'd like to bring it.  Um, so I mean it's, it's a challenge.  It's a good challenge.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you feel successful in what you're doing?
<b>PT:</b>	I just had my review according to, uh, my immediate boss and one of the owners and they like where it's going.  Um, a lot of work to be done.  It's okay.  I don't think, I don't hate my job.  Um, you know, but there are lots of things to be done.  So, sometimes I'll think about that work wise as far as trying to make sure everything's done.  Uh, there's always stuff to do around the house, you know, that kind of stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	How about appetite?  Has your appetite changed recently?
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Losing weight, gaining weight?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, purposely gaining weight, I think getting healthier.  My middle son and I, he joined a karate class a year or so ago, him and a friend, and his friend dropped out.  My wife suggested maybe it'd be a good idea, they offer a parent child one.  So we started doing that together and once I did that, which is a great workout, I decided to get a little healthier, so I've lost about 25 pounds over the last couple of months.
<b>DR:</b>	But do you feel better as a result physically?
<b>PT:</b>	I do, yeah.  My back feels much better.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  Has the irritability increased when you started changing your diet?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I don't think so because—
<b>DR:</b>	Have you been less tired since you starting losing weight or changing your diet?
<b>PT:</b>	Have I been less, mm—
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't think so.  I think all that's pretty much the same.
<b>DR:</b>	The same, okay.  How about concentration?  How's your concentration?
<b>PT:</b>	Since I start losing weight?
<b>DR:</b>	You said you've been feeling more depressed the last 2 years.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I mean there are—
<b>DR:</b>	Forgetting things more easily or?
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I really—
<b>DR:</b>	You can't see it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  You know, there are times that I will go over things again, you know, like if, you know, if in my mind reacted poorly or something and like of in the middle, it could creep in every now and then, but I don't think it's—
<b>DR:</b>	Not [INAUDIBLE].  Okay.  How about family history of depression?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I don't know, you know.  I, I, uh, I wouldn't doubt if my dad was although we really never talked about stuff like that.  I mean there are, um, we kind of joke about how my dad used to fly off the handle about stuff and—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my sisters, my two sisters, two older sisters and a brother, and you know, every now and then like at a family function or whatever, oh yeah, remember when dad, you know, like he would freak out.  My dad would definitely freak out.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, any panic episodes either for you or for him?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't, I don't know.  I don't know how you would define that.
<b>DR:</b>	Your heart starts racing.  You start sweating almost like having the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I probably had a few of those.
<b>DR:</b>	He did also?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  We really didn't, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	We didn't really have—
<b>DR:</b>	Is he still living?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, no, he, he, uh passed away 12 years ago.  Um, it's not that we didn't have a good relationship, but it just wasn't super close.  And that's kind of another thing too, you know, I want, I'd like to have a closer relationship with my boys.
<b>DR:</b>	How about your brother, are you close to him?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, he lives downtown.  He's single.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	He's younger?
<b>PT:</b>	He's younger, yeah.  We talk, um, we play hockey together.  I mean as, as adults, uh, in men's leagues, we—
<b>DR:</b>	Did you play hockey as a teenager as well?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I played golf more so than hockey, just picked up hockey, uh. some friends of mine that I grew up with played.  I think I picked it up later on.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, so you know, I played, and we follow, uh, racing, F1 racing which is on early Sunday mornings, and he'll call me 6:00 on a Sunday morning because he knows I'll be up watching the race, and we talk about stuff like that.  So, yeah, I mean we—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  How about your sisters, are you close to them?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.  Yeah, they call.  I talk to them often.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you shared with them what you're feeling?
<b>PT:</b>	Not really.
<b>DR:</b>	Not really.  How about your mom?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, no, not really.
<b>DR:</b>	And she has no depression history or?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't, I don't think so.  Well she, I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How about caffeine use?  Do you drink a lot of caffeine?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I have a couple of cups of coffee in the morning, but, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	Does it have a stimulating effect or a calming effect?
<b>PT:</b>	Stimulating for sure.
<b>DR:</b>	Could you drink it at night and fall asleep?
<b>PT:</b>	No, no actually, uh, probably 8 years ago, 8, 9 years ago, I de, I determined that I can't even have a—
<b>DR:</b>	You what?
<b>PT:</b>	About 8, 9 years ago I determined that I can't even have a Diet Coke like when I get home from work or I have a very difficult sleeping.
<b>DR:</b>	Falling asleep?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So, aside from the coffee in the morning, I really don't—
<b>DR:</b>	It kind of gets you going really.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I kind of like, it tastes great.  I love coffee.
<b>DR:</b>	You don't smoke?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I quit.
<b>DR:</b>	And alcohol is not an issue?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't think so.  I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	You haven't been increasing alcohol consumption in the last few years?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, no, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I definitely, um, you know, if the frequency has increased which I guess is debatable, uh, the amount has definitely decreased.  I mean, you know, you just can't do it anymore.
<b>DR:</b>	Medically you're healthy though?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Don't take medication of any kind?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I mean for seasonal allergies and asthma.  Other than that, no.
<b>DR:</b>	You have asthma?  You've had asthma since you were a child?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, no.  No, actually, um, I developed hayfever or whatever probably when I was [AGE] or so.  Um, I just remember, you know, my nose being runny in the fall, saw an allergist 7, 8 years ago, um, and, uh, she put me on, you know, she's like oh, oh, you know, it's the asthma's from whatever allergies I have to mold.  I had a, oh, that's what it was.  I had, uh, uh, stayed at a friend's house up in Michigan and had a point where I couldn't breathe.  I was wheezing, and because she lived in an old apartment above a shop and it was, it must have been mold that triggered my allergy.  Other than that—
<b>DR:</b>	So you're not on medication?
<b>PT:</b>	I am for, yeah, I take, uh, Asmanex.
<b>DR:</b>	Every day?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Well—
<b>DR:</b>	Winter's too or just springs?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, yeah, in the winters, um, I kind of cut back on it.  Uh, it doesn't seem as bad.
<b>DR:</b>	As bad, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, if I skip, uh, 2, 3 days it's okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, if I skip too long, I'll notice at night especially I'll wheeze a little bit and then I'll know, jump back on it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, and these irritable experiences have no relationship to the wheezing or the breathing problems [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay and no other medical issues?  Your heart is good.  You said you've been exercising?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I exercise, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	Run or walk?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I used to run.  Now my knees don't really enjoy that much anymore.  I go, uh, at lunch, there's a, the park district has a rec center.  I work in [DEIDENTIFIED].  So at lunch I go over and work out with weights.  Then I'll come back, you know, finish off the day and then my son and I do karate on Wednesdays and we practice at home.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  Well, you know, the question is why is the irritability there.  I mean work increase in terms of 2 years ago and your son, you know, having 3 children.  Is, is there any sense of feeling overloaded, that responsibility?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, for sure.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I mean 3 kids and a job.  Does your wife work or she—
<b>PT:</b>	She doesn't.  Um—
<b>DR:</b>	She's full time at home?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I mean it just didn't make sense.
<b>DR:</b>	And how's your relationship with her?
<b>PT:</b>	It's good.  I mean, you know, she's, um, she's great really and I think our, our relationship is, is really good, but I mean, you know, the kids really they test it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	They test our relationship.
<b>DR:</b>	How about your sex life?  Has that decreased with the kids or?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, it, it's good.  I think it's, I mean it's still—
<b>DR:</b>	You still have an interest in sex then?  You haven't lost interest?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  I mean as a whole, no.
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	No.  I mean, you know, I'm not in my 20s anymore, so yeah there are nights that I'm just, you know, need to go to sleep.  No, I think that's fine.
<b>DR:</b>	And you talk to her about these feelings?  You're open with her?
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	You mentioned on the phone that she could get some ideas—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, actually she sent the list.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, she did?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  She wanted to come, but my oldest has a playoff game today at 2:00.  Um, yeah, she sent a list, which is pretty much the same.  I mean she's—
<b>DR:</b>	And what did she say?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I don't know if you can read her writing.  It says always unhappy, which, can you read that?  Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Can't find any happiness in any activity, loss of interest in activities or?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I guess.  No hobbies.  Well, the karate thing.  Yeah, that's fun.
<b>DR:</b>	Slightly anti, so you're kind of withdrawn.  You don't like being around people or?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah probably.
<b>DR:</b>	Always right and rigid.  You can't admit a mistake.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, debatable [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	Does she feel that way?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's not the first time I've heard it.
<b>DR:</b>	To set him off [INAUDIBLE].  And this is new though, I mean when you first married you didn't have these angry outbursts or panic episodes?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Very negative.  Just now, or always?
<b>PT:</b>	She says always, and to be honest, yeah, I've probably, she says I'm negative.  I think, you know, I just see things kind of in my opinion as, as they really are.
<b>DR:</b>	A lot of resentment.  Where is that resentment coming from?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, she, uh, I don't know.  I don't—
<b>DR:</b>	Do you agree with that or?
<b>PT:</b>	Not as much as the others.
<b>DR:</b>	And you never tried to numb this, not with alcohol, not with marijuana?  You never in high school or never tried to escape?  Never had self destructive thoughts or feelings or feelings of wanting to run away from home?
<b>PT:</b>	Real, yeah, I mean real ones, no.
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	No, um, you know, it is what it is.  I mean you know, there's a lot of responsibilities.  As you said, there are always things that need to be done—
<b>DR:</b>	I know.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I have, um, these things need to get done.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	They, you know, the grass doesn't stop growing, and, you know, the house doesn't stop needing repair and that's kind of my focus.  I wish I could put it aside and take the 5 or 10 minutes to, to take care of the other problems that come up—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	But, you know, that's I think the thing, you know, if I feel I need to get something done, I don't have time for anything for else, and unfortunately there's always something that needs to be done.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I'm sensing this is a burden issue primarily, 3 kids, the responsibility of a management position.  Before that you did sales, you weren't a manager.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].  I think I would recommend an antidepressant and if an antidepressant would work, I think it'll take the edge off and things won't overwhelm you to the same degree.  You'll just kind of take things almost like water off a duck's back kind of thing, things that usually overwhelm your body won't to the same intensity.  I think it'll help.  I think you'll feel calmer.  I think you will reduce those anxious panic episodes.  Um, antidepressants are safe.  I don't know if you're familiar with antidepressants.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they're, they're really safe medications, uh, especially you, you know, you're healthy and no issues.  Sounds like there's some genetic connection with your dad in terms of a similar pattern.  Um, how would you feel about medication, trying medication?
<b>PT:</b>	I mean obviously if it helps, it helps.
<b>DR:</b>	The medication [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Well, well yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b>	No, not really.  Um, if it helps, it helps.  I don't, I don't want to feel kind of like I'm watching my, my life from the side, you know, like it's not really me.
<b>DR:</b>	Um.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, you know, I'm not opposed.  I'm not opposed.
<b>DR:</b>	You seem a little resistant.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm not.  I'm just thinking there's, um, usually on, usually on  Sundays in the summer, we'll, uh, we'll grill out whatever the boys want.  On the weekends, it's my turn to cook.  I love cooking so it's my turn to cook.  So, usually grill out.  My wife and I open a bottle of wine, and, you know, we always joke like if I have my first glass of wine, the boys are like, all right well dad has had his second glass.  You know, once he has his second glass we call that super dad juice, because it's like—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's like things are all kind of cool then.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Alcohol's a numbing agent, yeah, but you're not using it when you come home from work for that purpose?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  No, I mean there are lots of reasons.  I mean, you know, 1, alcohol, there's a lot of calories in it.  Two, I don't want to undo everything that, that I, I do, you know, because, you know, I, I try to stay fairly disciplined as far as my day at work, you know, my breakfast and my snack and my lunch and, my afternoon snack, I don't want to blow it all on calories on the alcohol.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  Well, this is like once a week or how often are you doing the wine thing?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, we haven't in months.  I mean she hasn't been around and things have been busy, you know, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Where has she been?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, she did some missionary work through her church.  She was gone for a week and—
<b>DR:</b>	Your wife?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	She was away for a week and you took care of the kids?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	That must have been, and you worked at the same time or you took time off?
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, I took the week off.
<b>DR:</b>	How did that feel?
<b>PT:</b>	Taking the week off, great.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Did you miss her though or?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah, I mean, you know, as a family.  I didn't really like the way the whole thing went down as far as her leaving, you know.  It was, it was hey, I'm going to go do this rather than—
<b>DR:</b>	Ask.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  Um.
<b>DR:</b>	Where did she go?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, she went up to an Indian reservation in Wisconsin and they built playgrounds and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	We've, we've sent some, um, clothing donations out there.  She's part Native American, so, um, we sent some clothing donations up there, and so they went up there and it was, they did good.
<b>DR:</b>	They.  Who did she go with?
<b>PT:</b>	The church group.  Um, actually not even our church.  She does all our, uh, networking for us, you know, around the neighborhood and getting to know people.
<b>DR:</b>	She's much more social than you are?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh absolutely, yeah, yeah, for sure.
<b>DR:</b>	She has a lot of friends?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, well yeah, and she's home with the kids, and they [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Do you seem to have friends in common?  I mean do you know friend's houses?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you comfortable with that or is that hard for you?  Kind of hard, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	How is this being here talking to me?  Is this kind of awkward or?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	It is?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It feels strange.
<b>PT:</b>	I got a little chest pain right now.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's hard to be, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's, and it's not just our shared friends.
<b>DR:</b>	Tension when you say chest pain, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Huh?
<b>DR:</b>	Tension is what you mean?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Um, I've had friends since high school that we still see.  One of them is having people over tomorrow for the, uh, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Are you going to go or?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Were you kind of a loner in high school or?
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I had a, a good group of friends, not a real big group.
<b>DR:</b>	What, what did you do with the friends?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, back in high school, oh gosh.  Um, well during the school year, I played golf and I wrestled, so that took up—
<b>DR:</b>	Played on the golf team?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, and, uh, that took a lot of time.
<b>DR:</b>	Where did you go to high school?
<b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].  Um, one of my friends, his family had a boat, and, uh, it was basically just a little cabin in the chain of lakes.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And this is in the 80's.  So I mean it was crowded, but not like it is now, but we would go up there most of the time, hang out there.  I mean just, nothing real specific really.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah, I think an antidepressant would help, I really do.  I, I think it would help you become more comfortable within you, and I just think it'll help overall the irritability, the anger, the negative feelings.  I, I think it'll, my sense is as we're talking that this has been almost a lifelong pattern, and it's just really intensified in the last 2 to 3 years because of maybe feeling overwhelmed, you know, talked about those possibilities.  I think you'll feel a lot better, and you know, you talked originally on the phone about therapy.  An analogy that I sometimes use is, um, computers.  You know, there's hardware and there's software to computers.  Hardware is like the chemistry of the brain.  When people are depressed, um, there are certain substances in the brain called neurotransmitters, which are made from proteins, and they actually fall, and what the antidepressants do, they build these back up to more normal levels.  Unless the hardware works on a computer, if you try to put software, it's not going to be effective.  That's like therapy, talk therapy.  You know, if, if we still have these proteins that are not in balance and we try to just do talk therapy, it's not going to be as effective as if you first correct the hardware and then input the software.  That's why I'm thinking what we need to do is get your brain first maybe in a better balance, and I think an antidepressant would do that, and I think within 2 to 3 weeks, I think you'll feel more comfortable and less irritable, less short with your kids.  I think it'll benefit the whole family.  Less negative.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Because our feelings are based on our chemistry, our brain chemistry.  We don't realize that, but it's true, and if we can correct that and you feel better, and then we can talk about therapy, you know, what may need or not need to happen.  I just think you'll feel much better more quickly by using an antidepressant.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Well, that's why I'm here.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, well you had actually said that on the phone.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, and that was, you know, in, I guess this isn't, this isn't new.  So, um, I've done some research and, and what have you, and that was kind of my feelings is I really don't know saying we could talk about things forever, but if there's something physically wrong.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  Yeah, let's do that.  Which antidepressant, um, the most widely used antidepressants are a group called the SSRIs.  I don't know if you researched that.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	They're basic.  They're safe, very few side effects.  Um, Prozac was the first of the class and it came out about '87.  Uh, it was an excellent drug.  I mean people felt better as a result and it didn't have too many side effects.  Over the years, they've improved, you know, they've kind of tweaked the benefits of the medicine and reduced the side effects.  What I'm thinking you would benefit from would be Lexapro.  I don't know if you researched Lexapro.  It's actually, it's like Prozac, a little bit cleaner version.  Side effects can occur.  Um, the most common is upset stomach upset maybe in the first week.  What I usually do is have you break the pill in half for the first 6 days or so and take it with food to try to avoid that.  If you don't have any stomachaches, then go up to the full pill.  That's the most common side effect.  Um, weight is, is essentially if you look at the research, weight neutral for a period of a year.  Um, sexual dysfunction can occur, uh, but we'll kind of watch that and see if it does.  Sometimes 25% of people have decreasability to orgasm or ejaculate.  Um, and those are really the most common side effects if you don't take any other medicine.  Um, alcohol really negates the benefit of antidepressants so I wouldn't recommend drinking right now.  I think if this drug works, and it'll take about 2 to 3 weeks to build up to get to a level where it'll be starting to be effective, but I think if I'm right, your quality of life will improve.  You just wouldn't have the need to calm down as much.  The drug is also approved for anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety and I think there's an anxious component, that's why your chest is tight being in a social situation.  I, I just think you'll get significant improvement.  If anything out of the ordinary happens, you can call me and we can talk about it, but 1 pill won't do.  It's like I say take half a pill for 6 days with breakfast.  If you have no side effects or stomach upset, go up to the full pill and stay on the full pill another week or 2 and I can see you in 2 to 3 weeks and by then you should start seeing something.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And I think your kids and your wife will [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Good.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I'm not sensing any history of bipolar disorder from what you've described because you never had periods of high where you felt euphoric that you needed to eat or sleep or anything like that in your life.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, great.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, so we'll try this.  I'll give you samples, and, uh, I think when I see you again, you'll just be calmer, the irritability will be less and I think you'll just feel lighter.  Things that usually overwhelm at work, you'll take more in stride.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  These are good drugs, you know, like I say, the pharmaceutical companies have really spent a [INAUDIBLE] lot of time in improving them over the years.  So when it works you don't really feel medicated, you just feel better and that's what we're looking for.  A small percentage of people do get some tiredness from it.  If that does occur, then you'll want to take it with dinner instead of breakfast.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But we'll start with breakfast and see, but if it does make you a little tired, then just take it with dinner, and other than that, do everything the same except watch the alcohol intake.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, which is—
<b>DR:</b>	Natural antidepressant, the most effective antidepressant is aerobic exercise, but you're doing exercise anyway.  Second most effective is sunlight, you know, so being outside and walking especially in the summer is healthy.  Diet is important because, uh, as I mentioned, these neurotransmitters are made from proteins, so you want to have more protein in your diet which will help boost these neurotransmitters.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Fish, chicken, things like that.
<b>PT:</b>	Which is, it isn't a problem even with the weight loss, it's the sugar.  I cut out the sugars, so, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, is that how you did it?  It was like a Zone diet or a South Beach diet.
<b>PT:</b>	It wasn't either really.  It was just I wanted to cut out really the sugars and—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well that's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Right, I know like the Atkins and all that stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, you know, I wasn't crazy about it.  If I came home and my wife made pasta for dinner, I'll have pasta.  I just—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you could eat pasta, but just, you know, just recognize the more protein you eat, the better you'll feel, and the dual benefit is that it'll help you lose weight too, but you don't want to lose any more weight though I don't think.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I mean wherever my body ends up is where it ends up.  Actually, um, that was the one thing, you know, for my lunch, I have a, a protein bar.  You know, it's whey protein.  So I think I'll actually probably, now that I'm down to close to where I want to be, I'll probably up my protein to see if I can put on some muscle.
<b>DR:</b>	Muscle yeah, and it'll help your mood as well so.
<b>PT:</b>	Good, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, any other questions or thoughts [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b>	No, um, you know, this is, I didn't know what to expect.  It's, you know, something completely new.  Um, you know, my wife and I could sit and theorize all day long about what might be wrong with me, but I kind of, kind of hope that, um, I would leave and say oh no, you're wrong.
<b>DR:</b>	But do you feel comfortable with what I'm saying or describing?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, um, I'm not surprised.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'm pretty certain and I, I think, I think the improvement will be significant in a relatively short period of time.  I just think you'll feel, I've seen patients who after they take an antidepressant, experiencing similar symptoms that you have been, say they feel better than they've ever felt.  I hope you experience the same.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Great.
