BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: [indiscernible] today.
COUNSELOR: Yeah?
CLIENT: One thing I do want to share with you so...I got the job that I applied for.
COUNSELOR: The one working with the geriatric  - 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Right. Okay.
CLIENT: But I'm kind of happy about it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I'm not sure what's going on with that within myself because for the first time in a long time I made a move which I really thought out.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Because where I am now, it's really stressful. And the other jobs that I was before I left - I had a feeling of feeling anxious.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And this time I felt like it was planned well. It's the agency I used to work for where I had to leave because I felt I was being over-utilized.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: And I didn't have a title. So I left after six years with them. And since that time, that's when I was jumping from job to job.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: And  - 
COUNSELOR: And that's the same agency you're going back to now with this new job?
CLIENT: No. That's the agency I'm leaving.
COUNSELOR: Okay, NDRN.
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: Right. But for some reason I get a feeling like, okay, you're not going to jump from job to job because we put closure on it.
COUNSELOR: On...?
CLIENT: On NDRN. Because it was - ever since I left NDRN that I was jumping from job to job.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: As if I had some sort of anger, not wanting to be taken advantage again.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: That all other jobs.
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: So I was thinking about it and it feels, I don't know, like a calming, professional calming?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So I'm kind of looking forward to this new job. We're talking in a different population. I think I - I really believe I put closure on NDRN.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. What was that - tell me more about what you mean by that, putting closure on it?
CLIENT: I worked for NDRN for six years.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: It's a good agency. But I find that they give more opportunities to a specific profile. If you're married and have kids, you tend - you tend to promote - get promoted within the agency. I think they have a thing with minorities. They just make it difficult. Because I know there were two cases where I worked at that time two years ago, three years ago, where there were two people who were totally incompetent but because they were white male they got promoted (3:05).
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Which is everywhere, basically, where you work. There's always some sort of prejudice. But society is what it is. And at the time that - I was there for six years, I liked what I did. But they had - I was working very closely with the director. Going to his meetings, doing his reports. I was on the insurance committee. And I - after eight months I felt, okay, I proved myself, let's talk about job, let's talk about more money. And it went on for two years. After two years I resigned and gave him a month's notice. And in the interim I had applied for another job, a supervisor's job in a different department and he stopped me. He promised me, please stay with me.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know. I promise to give you what you want. And it never came. So when I left I gave him a month's notice and on the last day of course, they offered me more money. So at that time - I learned a lesson at that point. If you like where you work, if they're willing to work with you even if it's the last minute, take it. But I didn't take it because I thought I made the other job. I was going to wait.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So I found out that in business it really doesn't matter. What does that do? Interview again and find somebody else.
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: So I felt like I shouldn't have done that. I should have taken the opportunity. Because I went into foster care.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Boy that was not the job for me. A very sad job. Life is hard, but knowing the stuff that some kids go through, it was really heartbreaking. So from there I moved to, I think it was CCC again. Of course it was horrible. And I have no tolerance. And I think it was, I think an anger given six years to NDRN and they just screwed me. I mean literally took advantage of me being a good worker.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And not wanting to give me the promotion and the title I deserved because I was a single, you know, person. And it was a known fact that I was - that I am a lesbian. 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So that too could have played a part in it. So every time I move from job to job because I really haven't been happy. I used to stay in jobs three or four years. And in the last two and a half years its seven months, eight months. Always under a year.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I went back to NDRN about six months ago.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: In a supervisory position. The money wasn't any big deal. But it wasn't - it's not a nice place to work. The stuff that goes on there is unbelievable (5:56). And the amount of stress and responsibility that I have. I was not happy. Then they promised me a $1500 bonus for working alone as a supervisor, and without discussing it with me further they changed the whole thing. They tacked it onto my salary and just gave it to me retro until the second supervisor came on board. So I felt sneaked again. Because they already gave me an offer and approved it and then they just changed it. So this time I said, look, this has been going on every day for the next few years at this salary, and the amount of stress that I'm going under. And I sent out my resume.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And a few jobs I said no, that's not for me. I didn't feel like I was in such a great hurry as I've been before. But this time I got a good feeling about this place, with the seniors, just a skilled nursing facility.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And the last time we spoke I hadn't heard from them. And I heard from them on Friday, the next day. And then they offered me the position.
COUNSELOR: This was a number of weeks ago you interviewed there.
CLIENT: Yes, it was April 16 when I went there. It was April 16. And I remember I went on the interview and then I came here.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I don't even want to [indiscernible]. So it's - I feel like maybe that was the problem.
COUNSELOR: The lack of closure with NDRN?
CLIENT: Right. Mmm hmm. Because I liked working there.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And the fact that I really wanted to stay there but I felt like, no, I'm not going to let them take any more advantage of me. They did it for two years.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And then when I left and I followed - I think the mistake was I went to foster care.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Which was - everyone worked there was so absolutely boring. They were on foster care. It's very stuck. Yeah, it really has been stuck. Which I think that, kind of like what you said, I think that all just, got really worse and I was really not unhappy. It was just the principle of working for NDRN.
COUNSELOR: Right. But I - when you say closure, I mean that's a word people use a lot. And everyone sort of assumes they understand what everyone else means by it. But I'm interested in hearing, like what that means for you. This idea of closure with NDRN.
CLIENT: To me it means I worked for them six years.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I was considered a good worker. And I enjoyed what I did. And I think forced me to leave (9:01). And because of going into foster care and them making me the offer the last day that I was there and me not accepting it, that felt like I acted two-facedly. So going back and seeing that they're still doing what they do...
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Working each - you know, working the workers really hard and not really paying them a lot of money.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And then what they did with the bonus they offered to give me and they just reneged on it.
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: And so that gave me something to pacify me. You know to me that they agreed to give me the $1500 bonus and that should have been there. Because that wasn't what they promised to me. And then changing it and not discussing it with me, saying look, Tess this is what we said. As it turns out I overstepped my boundaries and I need you to authorize it, I would have understood that more. But being disregarded and then says, like, here's this and this is what it is. It made - it just made me - it just reconfirmed the fact that it was time to leave the agency.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So I feel like going back was the thing where, no, you weren't wrong in the first place to leave. They were taking advantage of you and will continue to take advantage of you.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So it's kind of like a confirmation or an affirmation of the idea that it is a place that you should separate from.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: But I know you really liked working with the population of people there.
CLIENT: Yeah. Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: It sounds in fact like you feel mixed in some ways because you know yes, the place takes advantage of you and they're not a nice organization to work for but that there was something that you got out of being there.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. The clients. Yeah, I know that a love was there. The clients are very lovey. They grow attached to you, you grow attached to them. And being in that field you have to have a certain level of maternal instinct, I guess? Wanting to take care of them, making sure they're learning some specific skills and they're learning daily lessons. They're like children even thought they're adults biologically.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So yeah, that's the mixed feeling. You know. Because it's almost like a sense of guilt. Because they're going to have to accept the change - the change or the fact that I'm not going to be there. And there was certain bonds that are created. There's quite a few clients who I'm very attached to (12:02). And vice versa. So that's the hardest part.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: That's the hardest part. But you know, I'm not going to sacrifice me - 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know, for the sake of - that part of me. I can always visit.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And come back and say hello.
COUNSELOR: But what's it like making, or saying goodbye to the people who you have become attached to there?
CLIENT: It's - I haven't done it, because it's next week, next Friday's my last day.
COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: So it worries me. Today something happened and I said oh, boy this is not going to be easy. Two consumers off the bus crying because the matron was upset, she was crying for some reason. And I asked her what was the matter, you know she was okay. She didn't share the information so I assumed it was personal. But the fact that they saw her upset and they like her, it upset them very much.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: It was horrible. So we had - they took about three minutes to - them to calm down and say look, she's okay. It's okay to cry, you know. She's feeling bad and it's okay to cry. You don't have to be sad for her. You know she'll be okay. And she composed herself and told them look, look, I'm okay. They felt better but they were hysterical crying. It was like - it's like when a child sees a parent hurt or in pain, it's like they feel the same pain. And I said oh, boy, this is not going to be easy. So that makes me sad.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Because obviously I'm going to cause them some sort of discomfort. But they'll get over it. So that's a little uncomfortable for me.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But it's done tomorrow, I'm going to go from group to group, because there are two groups and sit with them and tell them that I'm leaving and next week is, you know, my last day. And so that they'll have an understanding.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Frederick is the one that I'm worried about because I'm very, very attached to him. He has Down Syndrome.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And he's like my favorite. He really is. And he used to cry a lot. Like a big baby, he'd whine and woo and when he didn't get his way, then it got better.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Because it's so much better, not so many people and sometimes they couldn't give him the time that he needed to address the simplest thing.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And in that - in me he saw that he could come to me and I would stop and listen.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So we really bonded. So I'm going to really - and then my coworkers are cruel, because they say to me, how are you going to live without him? And then like, do you need to tell me that? I don't need to hear that (14:59).
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So it's going to be hard and it's going to be very difficult. For about a week or two or whatever time it takes, I'm going to feel bad.
COUNSELOR: Bad?
CLIENT: Bad. I'm going to feel sad.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know. Wondering what do they do now? Or you know - because I feel a - their sense of absence is like a child's.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: They mourn.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: So it's - that's going to be rough. I'm not looking forward to next week because usually it's a process, an event that's - they anticipated that's going to happen.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And so - and Lisa, this other girl, she's higher functioning. And as soon as I made the announcement, you know the whole day she was - you could see it. She wasn't coping well. She said oh, I'm not going to see you anymore. And I said well, you have my number. You're free to call, you know, and say hello. You're not going to come back and visit. I said no, that's not true, I will come back. You won't see me often because if I'm working an you guys are here then things conflict. So I'll have to wait until there's a holiday that you're working or have time off to come and visit.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But yes, you're not going to see me but you can always call. So it's going to be hard. And that's the reality of separation.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm struck by a couple of things and one is the fact that these sound like really strong and tender attachments that you've got  - 
CLIENT: Oh, yeah.
COUNSELOR: - to the clients who you work with. And I didn't know this. This is the first I'm hearing about it.
CLIENT: You have to have [indiscernible]. You know.
COUNSELOR: I'm just also thinking about what you're saying about how it feels to separate and to say goodbye and to you know achieve closure with your job and do all of that, thinking about the fact that that's next week for you and then like, the week after that it will be you and I.
CLIENT: Yeah, I was thinking about that today. I need to go after today.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Because as you said quite a few things are going on right now (17:58). And - but I don't feel distressed by it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: First of all I think this is only the reception, you talked about it already a few times. And so - and then looking at it as what is this ending mean? It means it's the end of what we've accomplished or what we've achieved. So I don't feel, you know, really bad about it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So, like I said it was expected.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So it's like I have an understanding about the job I'm leaving now, the job I'm going to, which is the only thing right now that I'm feeling a sense of uncertainty. Because I've grown to be distrusting. You know? They paint you one picture and then when you're there, it's like dating someone and then you don't know what he's like or she's like until you live with them?
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: So that's the only thing that I'm really concerned with. But ending these sessions and leaving NDRN is a sad thing because of its end but the process. How can I say it? What I went through to get to the end is one thing. You know I learned a lot of things about myself.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: At NDRN and I realize that maybe it's closure. So it's what's going there and it's not worth the ending [ph].
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. How are goodbyes for you generally? Generally speaking?
CLIENT: Goodbyes? They're okay. I think there might be a certain level of the usual pushing feelings down.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Because it's easy for me to - I'd rather take the easy route and say no, you know, it's over than look at something. So goodbyes to me are you know - to me they seem easy but I maybe don't know the real truth about it to myself. I'm not one that, no, I don't want to say goodbye, you know like...it's like when Willa didn't want to be with me anymore.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I remember I didn't mourn it. I remember feeling the sensation like, well everything left my body (21:00). It was almost like passing out.
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: And I just looked at her and I said why? And, I just don't want to be with you. So, I don't want to make you if you don't want to be here. And I was really floored as far as what that [indiscernible] meant to me and I went into a depression and I was in the hospital for a month.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I'm not really sure. And then Elle broke up with me, I don't want to be with you anymore. And it's like, why? So I started crying like, to feel anger. Oh, okay, fine.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And then I go through, I think what to me is loner, the sadness, the crying.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: The separation, missing the person.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. So maybe you're not as out of touch with those feelings as you think. Or as you're suggesting. It sound like a lot of it is there. And what you said, I mean the way you described it like, someone's breaking up with you, you feel angry and afterwards you feel the sadness and then missing the person, I think that is natural. I think that is the way it is for a lot of people.
CLIENT: I think so. I have to stop thinking it as in contrast to the usual, you know - I think I keep my cool more than the usual person, the average person, with don't leave me, I don't want you to leave me. And they carry on and they cry. Yes I was feeling emotion but I think I'm more in control than letting myself get all out of shape because of the goodbye.
COUNSELOR: Do you ever wish though that you could let yourself get all out of shape?
CLIENT: It could start from my father. He wasn't good to me and he was in and out of my life so much. You know, it just grew accustomed to him coming in and out of my life. I hoped. A lot of I think what - the way I think that an adult has to do, the stuff that I went through as a kid and how I kind of like cope with it or accepted it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And didn't learn to control myself and not be mean. Like with my father left, maybe it would have been healthier to cry each time. Oh, I don't want him to go. I miss him. But I never did that.
COUNSELOR: Why do you think it might have been healthier?
CLIENT: Because I think letting your emotions - I've learned that letting your emotions surface and facing them is healthy. You get it out of your system instead of one here and one here and one here until something just breaks or becomes something else (23:59). 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: A commitment. A lot of things. So I've learned it. I don't know if I'll ever be able to do that. Because I do realize I'm letting her go. And I've been who I am for all that time, from relationship to relationship whether it's an intimate relationship or family or friends. You know but I do realize that my almost coldness  - 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: - has pushed people away. If anyone was to check [ph], not many people know how I feel. Crying, like my voice got very so cold. And it's - it's not good. And it's healthier to deny what you're feeling then you should let them. And don't let them know like, you hurt my feelings. I'm very angry. No. Expressing feeling, crying [indiscernible].
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I just see things differently. So I - I'm not sure if it will unfold but we can give it a try.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: To see if things change. It is hard for me.
COUNSELOR: Well you were talking about your dad sort of coming in and out of your life and maybe getting accustomed to that pattern of things. But when you said that I was thinking about, but then there was one time when he went away an didn't come back. You know, when you were a teenager. And if that was something that at the end you felt regret about.
CLIENT: Very much so, yeah. But that was because my mom was pressuring me to feel and take sides and I did. I'm not a vehement person.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Nothing I can do about that because you know he's gone.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know, it's something I kind of have to live with.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. You know one of the things that occurs to me now, you were saying that you know when you broke up with Willa or with Elle that there was the period - there was the feeling you had at the moment in time and then when you were alone there were the other feelings that came afterwards like the sadness and missing the person, things of that sort. You were talking about leaving NDRN and leaving clients and that you know it's probably going to be (27:00) - there's going to be some feelings that you'll have about that for a couple of weeks afterwards. Of feeling like missing them and those sorts of things. It occurs to me that in regard to this, what we're doing here, you know you are - you've been expecting that we're going to end, that I've sort of prepared for that. But that there could also be in regards to those feelings that you have afterwards, you know, things that come to you later on after we're done. I don't know what those would be necessarily but it's something that's actually is not uncommon. And you were just describing it as part of your experience of saying goodbye to people or to places or things.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well I've thought about that. Like you know what's going to happen? Oh, this is what you got out of it, this is what you understand.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Kind of like mixed feeling, oh, it will be nice not to pay $30 a week out of my pocket.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And that's $30 extra for me. And I also thought, okay, I'm not talking to anybody. I'm not going to be talking to anybody because that's who you are Tess. You don't talk to anybody.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So I said well, see what happens. Give yourself a break from therapy.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Because it's almost a year of my life.
COUNSELOR: All this is. It's a good chunk of time.
CLIENT: Yeah. It's a big chunk of time. So see what happens. You haven't been feeling bad. When I'm home I'm not depressed.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: If I had any episodes it was probably about Kate joining Lundy. But nothing major. So I'll see what happens. Maybe when this is over and you're going to start, maybe you'll start applying your information or you know listen to the coin that I think my next - my backup plan is to seek counseling and continue this. Because I've just concluded that I'm not quite done.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Like you said, I don't know what - I'm ready for me to be last session.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So I know that that's coming to a closure but then I'm at the same time looking back and saying, okay, at this point this is where I am so...And I said the only drawback is I'm not going to be talking to anyone for awhile (30:01). What is all the information going to do for me then?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Well what about that - that you're not going to be talking with me anymore and that you were saying that, you know, that that's who you are and that you probably won't be talking to anybody at that point? What's that prospect feel like?
CLIENT: It feels like - because I can talk to Sharon, I can talk to maybe Beth if I really like pushed the envelope. I don't need to talk too much about every thing. But it's not - it's not the same. It wouldn't be the same. So I'm pretty much sure. But I know it's not going to be the same. So I know I wouldn't talk to anybody else. It's not the same. I feel - I feel like I'm going to lose something that is stimulating for me.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know how when you talk to people who are relatives or friends, they - you know they try to tell you what you want to hear. So they really don't have the skills to get you to - how could I explain it? It's almost like - I understand that your job is to get me to realize things. This - and you also at the same time see things that need to be pointed out. You know, I see you seem to be sad. Yeah, I am. It's like we get in touch - you make me get in touch with my emotion. When you talk to someone who doesn't have that skill, most likely they're saying oh, you'll be okay. That's not the point. Of course I'll be okay. I have to be okay if I want to go on and you know another day. But that's not the point. You know? They know but they don't think gee, I know but things must be really terrible for her. So nobody takes so to speak, takes me and puts my head on their shoulder and say, I understand how you feel. They'll say whatever they think you need to hear. Or they'll join you in criticizing, if you're angry they'll join you in the anger. That - I think that's my biggest concern. I think that's the biggest loss that I'm going to feel. Is that that talking to other people is not going to be as stimulating for me or educational for me (33:02). So that's what worries me the most. I'm not going to talk to you anymore so it's going to happen. But like I said my Plan B is you know contact another agency and continue in counseling. And then see what happens from there.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: That's my major concern when I walk out the door. I can't see what - wait and see what happens now.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And it might not happen one week or two weeks, it can happen a month when I find myself like well, okay. Certain things have come up and I haven't spoken a word about them. 
COUNSELOR: One thing I was thinking of when you said that you know you can talk with Beth, you talk with Sharon, was - it would be hard to talk with Sharon since you don't want her to have the information.
CLIENT: I know. So...But I know that if I really wanted to, you know, she would listen.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Like I said, if I push the envelope, they would be there. Really something else.
COUNSELOR: But, yeah, I hear what you're saying - I mean my impression as we've been working together is that you've really worked in therapy. You know you've really spent a lot of time working to understand things and to understand yourself better and to get as much benefit as you can out of it. And it seems like you know what you're describing is like, not having anymore the opportunity in a way to do that kind of - that kind of work, you know because you were talking about if you talk with somebody who you know who's a friend they might tell you what they think you want to hear and be agreeable with you. And that has it's place. But it seems like you really appreciate a challenge.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Mmm hmm. Too many people in this life don't - I'll never understand it. People would rather not tell you the truth than be up front. They'd rather make an excuse for something instead of telling you the truth. And it's everywhere, work, family. People just tell you the cheap. And I personally rather would hear the truth from a person even if it's about me so that I could learn about myself.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Because it's almost as if I don't see who I am, you see it better. I might think I'm doing something towards you that is okay and it really isn't okay.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. But it takes a certain sort of strength to be open that way, to looking and considering what somebody else has to say. You know, to getting somebody else's view of you.
CLIENT: Yeah. But this is true. Not that many people are [indiscernible] - the hardest thing to do is see yourself. Yeah and I'm like that I think. I really like the feeling of being understood by everybody.
COUNSELOR: You were about to say something else though. You like that you...
CLIENT: I think that's, I decided to do it differently. I just chose - I was going to express that, but that's what it is. I like the feeling of being listened to and regarded.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I don't like being pacified. I don't. But I also like it to be said to me and expressed to me in an intelligent way. Just being regarded. Like I said if I come home and I'm down and blue and I'm talking and say you know, what's the matter? You take it personal and I'm responsible for your feeling, oh, my god, rejected. No it's not about Tess. Tess needs space? Okay, I'll leave you alone. That's really important (41:58).
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: It's very important. And like I did before, if I don't hear words that stimulate me, in the sense I guess that I appreciate learning what I've learned and realizing what, you know, I realize about certain things. 
COUNSELOR: You know when you put it that way too though that it's been stimulating, it sounds sort of, you know like it's been this rewarding thing. Which I think it probably has been, but it's also been hard. I mean I think that you know you're talking about having gotten a lot out of this process but the process itself I think at times is very hard to go through, painful at times.
CLIENT: Unknowingly bearable. I didn't realize it was going to be hard.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Yes, very rewarding. Part, because of my past experiences. The whole - because who I've become.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Because of those experiences.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And - but even realizing why it was hard made it more and more. It's very hard.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Just because describing it as stimulating sounds like - I mean stimulating sounds like a good thing. And I think there are probably also times that like while, you know you can look back and say, stimulating, there probably other ways you might have described it like in the moment as you were going along.
CLIENT: It's exactly what it felt. It just felt very stimulating.
COUNSELOR: Like when you were, you know, were upset and cried? Did that feel, I mean...
CLIENT: Well that's...
COUNSELOR: That's what I mean.
CLIENT: That was difficult.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: I mean because that was a very strong emotion and I fought tooth and nail. And - not that I won but it surfaced. So that wasn't stimulating but, one or two days later it was.
COUNSELOR: Right. That's what I mean.
CLIENT: Mmm hmm. At that moment, no. It was difficult.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because you were - you're reflecting on the positive things that you got out of it which is a great thing to do. But it's also - but you've I guess left out in some ways the fact that, you know there were times when I started to say something and you're thinking like, you know, let's not go there (45:08). Or I don't want to go there. Or times when it was painful. Or times when you know you left here and just felt really depressed. You know, there were negative times too.
CLIENT: Mmm hmm. But I don't see them as negative, I just see them as realization. Realizing that I am in pain. You know. And it's funny because you mention that and I remember one time, I think it was the time that I cried, I went and parked in the garage you know and just one big car that just almost took two spots. And to get home after the second time, parking was really - and in the garage because they've overbooked.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So I remember I put the car in the spot but, oh boy, I said if I leave it here, it's so close I had to sort of jimmy myself out. If I leave it here, people are so inconsiderate nowadays that they'll bang the door, you know because then I'm making inconvenient for them. So usually I'd just take the car and just sneak out this parking spot, but I wanted to get in there. I didn't want to go to another. I was upset. And I remember somebody trying to get out. But I was angry. I got out of the car and started kicking the tires with all my might. And kicking it and I was angry. And I realize it wasn't because of the car. It was because I realized that - the amount of pain that I was in. So it lasted me about a day or two.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know, and then I was depressed. Remember I told you I was depressed for about a week and all of a sudden it just subsided.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Then I started laughing. I must have looked like a real idiot kicking the tires on my car. But it was - on top of crying I wanted to do more. But I didn't. So that was an opportunity and that's how I saw it. So I don't see those things as negative [indiscernible]. Because that pamphlet that you gave me when I first came here that described what therapy is...
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: It really is very descriptive in what to expect.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: So I really have a - almost a full understanding of what - of who you are and what you can become through therapy.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So I didn't see it as negative. It was just an evolution almost. Evolving from someone who just suppresses and actually feeling the anger (48:05).
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: So it was hard, it was hard for me.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: We can't foretell the future and what's going to happen, you know? You don't know what's going to happen next. As I sit here wondering, you know why is he concentrating so much on the last session? And why are you concentrating not so much on you know, this is it, we have two more sessions?
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: That kind of like crosses my mind.
COUNSELOR: Why would you guess?
CLIENT: Is it you think I'm going to have a nervous breakdown? Does he think I'm not going to hold up? Or - it almost feels like you're making a big deal out of it. And for me it's not.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: It's not really a big deal. Because I have like I said an expectation of, there goes my stimuli, there goes my person I'll talk to. But what am I going to be going to next? Well, if you start feeling how you felt before when you came into therapy then it's time to continue.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So I think in my mind I have it pretty much planned as far as if a happens you'll do b. If c happens you'll do d.
COUNSELOR: Well, you know to tell you where I'm coming from, which we don't really have time for because we're almost out of time. To tell you where I'm coming from, it's not from the perspective of feeling like, you know there's a breakdown in the making or anything like that. It's more from the perspective that I think it's worth talking about. It's not something that people get to do very often really, to talk about the process of saying goodbye. You know like how you were saying that you had plans to go to work tomorrow and start telling the clients that you'll be leaving so that you can begin a process of, you know, of taking your leave, them taking a leave from you. It's not something that we always get to do in life. A lot of times goodbyes are really abrupt. You know, it's...
CLIENT: Oh, okay. I see.
COUNSELOR: And I think, you know there's something to be gained from it. I think it also is something - goodbyes are hard for people a lot of times (50:59). And you know they will deal with goodbyes the way they deal with a lot of the rest of life. You know whatever it is that they habitually do to deal with life. And you know what you're saying to me about, you expected that it's 30 session and you know, you've gotten a lot out of it and it makes sense. And you know, that it's been stimulating and you'll lose your stimulation. All of that makes sense to me. It also occurs to me that you mean - you've tied it up into a tiny package that's you know, manageable. With no like, sort of uncomfortable emotions like spilling out around the edges. You know you're describing it in a very, you know, calm and cool and collected way. I'm not saying it should be otherwise, I'm just noticing that it's like - it's what you do. You're doing it.
CLIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: Here, with this. 
CLIENT: That's true. Now I understand. It's true. Goodbyes are usually abrupt. At least in my life that has been abrupt.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And it's true. Because I really talk about saying goodbye. And I was like, for each person.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But I have to go. I wasn't being abrupt there. Because it seemed important but now I understand why. It's true. People don't sit down and say you know, this is not working out. They talk about no, I don't want to be with her anymore, mad or whatever.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: It's true. Isn't it ironic that at work I'm doing the same thing. I'm going through a process of saying goodbye, not just leaving on the 16th and that's the end of the story.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. I mean it's been - you've had meaningful relationships with the clients at work. And I had understood that it's the thing to do to not treat those relationships lightly. You know but to give yourself and the clients a chance to process that you're leaving. And I feel like this has been a meaningful and significant relationship and that you know, we should have benefit of the same thing.
CLIENT: Makes sense (53:57).
COUNSELOR: So now we're out of time.
CLIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Do you need anymore of these?
CLIENT: No, you gave me a stack the last time I was here. Okay. Okay.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Bye bye.
