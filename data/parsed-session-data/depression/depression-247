BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	So, how you doing?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm doing okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  So what's new?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, not, not too much.  Uh, I'm just having, I think I'm having, um, a little bit of trouble with feeling depressed.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And when did you notice that you were feeling more depressed, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I think it was, it was last Wednesday or Thursday.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so Wednesday or Thursday.  So 6, maybe 6 days, something like that.  Okay, did anything happen back then that triggered the depression or it just kind of come on out of the blue?
<b>PT:</b>	It just kind of came on.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, so you're just feeling more sad or irritable?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, more sad and lethargic.  Uh, like I just wanted to lay, I just lay on the couch and—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Don't want to do anything.
<b>DR:</b>	How's your sleep been with Lunesta?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't think it works for me too well.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're not sleeping well.  Are you having trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep?
<b>PT:</b>	I'll sleep for about an hour, or hour and a half, and then I wake up.
<b>DR:</b>	And then are you able to get back to sleep right away, or does it take a while?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I was taking the Lunesta at night and then I started trying to see if I could fall asleep first and I would and then I'd wake up, and then I'd, you know, take one then.
<b>DR:</b>	You mean to get back to sleep?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And then would you sleep through the rest of the night—
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Or not?
<b>PT:</b>	No, sometimes I'd, I'd stay awake for a long time or—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, or wake up.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, has the weight gain leveled off since you got off the Doxepin?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So your weight stabilized?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I feel like it has.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How's your appetite been lately?
<b>PT:</b>	My appetite.  Um, I think it's okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, how's your focus or concentration?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, gosh, I can't, I haven't done anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you able like to play music and stay focused for a while?
<b>PT:</b>	I haven't played any music.
<b>DR:</b>	You haven't wanted to or?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I haven't wanted to.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you watching TV or?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I usually just lay there—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, or reading.
<b>PT:</b>	With my eyes closed.
<b>DR:</b>	So, you're really not doing much during the day.  Uh, you just kind of stay in bed all day long?
<b>PT:</b>	Staying on the couch.
<b>DR:</b>	On the couch.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I just lay there with my eyes closed.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, are you worrying about things a lot, or not really?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't feel like I am.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Have you had any suicidal thoughts recently?
<b>PT:</b>	No, no.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So it sounds like you're just kind of fatigued, depressed, no motivation, not much joy in things, not much interest.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, we may need to, and about sleeping well, that's important too.  We may make some changes in the medication.  Any new stresses in your life that you can, uh, pinpoint?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I have a new sponsor because, because sometimes I just don't want to talk anyone when I get like this, and I get stressed out about having to call, and not returning calls to my friends.
<b>DR:</b>	You haven't been returning calls.  And your new sponsor, you're talking to your new sponsor?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I call, but it's really hard to get myself to do it.  I don't want to do it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Have you told your sponsor you're feeling depressed?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I told him a little bit I guess.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I'm just curious, did he have any suggestions or advice for you about that or not really?
<b>PT:</b>	Not really.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, just he's giving me things to do in the book and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So [PATIENT NAME] I'm just looking, you're taking the 2 Paxil still every day, right, 80 mg.  The Wellbutrin, you're still taking 1 which is 300.  Okay, you're still taking the Abilify.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, and the Lithium.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, and then the Lunesta which doesn't seem to be working.  Um, we're at the maximum of Paxil.  We're not at the maximum of Wellbutrin.  We can go higher.  We can go up to 450 mg and that's the one, of all the antidepressants, that's probably the most likely to give you some energy and get you going.  Do you want to try increasing the dose of that one?
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	I think it'd be a good idea.  Let me get you a prescription.  Now they don't make a 450 mg strength tablet, so that means you have to take 3 of the 150's to get to that dose.
<b>PT:</b>	Three of the 150's?
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	You've been taking the 300.  Um, so do you have quite a few of those left, do you know?
<b>PT:</b>	I think I do.  I'm not sure.
<b>DR:</b>	If you do.  I'll write a prescription for 3 of the 150's a day, but if you have a bunch of the 300's, you can take a 300 with 1 of the 150's to get to 450 mg.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Does that make sense?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Or so you don't have to waste the 300's.  Um, or when those run out, you can just take 3 of the 150's, okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So, and you're taking the brand name I believe, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yes I am.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and I think we want to stick with that because I'm hearing more reports of problems with the generics.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So let's try this, uh, first stuff, and hopefully this will help pull you out of it.  If it doesn't in the next few weeks, then we can do some other things to get you feeling better, okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	If you feel like you start sinking any lower, will you call me because I don't want things to get any worse.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I don't think they will with the medication.  I think it'll actually be better, but I just want to sure we're moving in the right direction.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Any questions about that at all?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, no.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now the other thing we need to talk about is sleep I guess because if the Lunesta's not working, that's going to contribute to your depression, and if we can find something to help you sleep better, that'll help get out of the depression.  Um, I'm just looking back to see what we tried before.  The Trazodone caused kind of a morning hangover.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It was, I don't know, it was a weird one.  When it was a low dose it didn't work, and then when it got too high, it was [INAUDIBLE] in the morning.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You know, another thing we might consider, have you taken, yeah, you did take Seroquel.  Do you remember how it affected you?  It's been a year or so ago.
<b>PT:</b>	The only thing I did with Seroquel was I think I ate more.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, because I was going to say at low doses, it has several uses.  The lower dose is used for insomnia.  It also helps with bipolar depression, and it also has mood stabilizing properties.  Something we could try at a lower dose for sleep.  You were on a pretty good dose of it before, 4 to 500 mg.  Let me look back and see if you had problems with it.
<b>PT:</b>	I like the Doxepin, but it, it's just the, the, the weight gain and the, and the, what is it, the, I can't remember, like the—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, the weight gain was the big—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Seroquel we stopped [DATE].  Oh, you had pneumonia at that time.  See if there anything else?  It was increasing your appetite, so we probably don't want to go back to that again.  Um, we want to stay away from the addicted medications.  Uh, let me keep thinking about that one as we're talking, okay, and we'll see if we can come up with something else that'll work better for you.  The problem with Wellbutrin is it sometimes can worsen insomnia because it is kind of an energizing antidepressant.  Sometimes that carries over into the evening hours.  Sometimes it's hard for people to get to sleep.  I don't know if that's contributing or not, but we want to find something that'll help you sleep well at night.  Okay, well what else has been going on?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, let's see, before that, you know, I was going to my meetings and, um, and doing those, those things.
<b>DR:</b>	So you are going pretty regularly or have you cut back since—
<b>PT:</b>	I've cut back since I started feeling, uh, bad.
<b>DR:</b>	When was the last time you went to a meeting?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, Saturday before the football game.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, which football game?
<b>PT:</b>	The, the, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, Air Force?
<b>PT:</b>	Air Force.
<b>DR:</b>	You go to the, do you have season tickets or do you—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Was it fun?
<b>PT:</b>	It was, yeah, it was fun.
<b>DR:</b>	Air Force won.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, 38, I think 38 to 17 or something like that.
<b>DR:</b>	They're doing really well this year.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you have any other games you're going to?
<b>PT:</b>	We're going to one this Saturday—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Too.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you know who they're playing?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not sure.
<b>DR:</b>	I think they—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, TCU.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I think, no, I think they're—
<b>PT:</b>	No, no.
<b>DR:</b>	Was it Utah or BYU?
<b>PT:</b>	BYU.
<b>DR:</b>	That'll be good one.
<b>PT:</b>	It's hard.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So they got a couple of tough games coming up, but if they do well, it could really propel them into the, some of the bowls, so.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you like going to the games?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I like going to the games.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	I notice that my personality has changed a lot since last year when we used to go.
<b>DR:</b>	In what way?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  [NAME OTHER] says.  Because I used to really, uh, excited and jump up and, you know, things like that and she says I act differently now.
<b>DR:</b>	More subdued?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh, okay.  Is that just since you've been depressed, or even before?
<b>PT:</b>	Before.  I think it's just that I, I just don't have that, that energy feeling, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I have no, you know, but it's not all the time.  I mean it does come and go.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I'm just trying to figure out what can we do to keep you out of the depression.  That's what I'd really like to find a way to do.  And sometimes if we understand what triggers it, that helps us.  Sometimes it just comes out of the blue.  Okay, is there anything you're looking forward to besides going to the Air Force games?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, no.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, how are your lessons going?  Are you still teaching?
<b>PT:</b>	"Yeah, when I, when the lessons start, I always do better.  I don't know why.	"
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well for many people that's true when they're depressed.  If they can find something to do, if they're active, it helps at least temporarily.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't want to do it, but once the kids get there, it's usually, um, I get more motivated.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  Okay, and how many lessons or hours of lessons do you teach in a week now?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, let's see, about 16.
<b>DR:</b>	Sixteen lessons or hours?
<b>PT:</b>	Sixteen lessons.
<b>DR:</b>	Lessons.  Is that about where you want to be?
<b>PT:</b>	"Yeah.  Right now I am because I take Tuesdays off because of, um, uh, I have my continuing care tonight and, uh —	"
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I like, uh, having the day off to, I'm kind of easing my way back into doing stuff more and more.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay, good, and often how often do you go to continuing care?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, once a week on Tuesdays.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	At 6:00.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you still feeling positive about that?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, you know, sometimes it's really good, and then sometimes it's kind of, it depends on how the counselor is.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So it's a different person on different weeks?
<b>PT:</b>	No, it's the same person.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	But sometimes she'll get off on talking about, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Tangents.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like football.
<b>DR:</b>	Um—
<b>PT:</b>	Instead of talking about drug addiction and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b>	I see.  Now, at continuing care, do they charge for that, or is that part of—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's, um, $500 if you finish their program.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, and is insurance covering that?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah, they pay for that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  Okay, good, and the continuing care goes on for how long [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b>	It goes on for, continuing care, for a year.
<b>DR:</b>	One year, okay.  So you're planning to stick it out for the year then?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I want to do, I'm not going to do anything for the first year.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	Except just, you know, recovery stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	I think that's wise.  You're going to continuing care.  You're going to meetings.  Um, you do a lot of things to take care of yourself.  That's good.
<b>PT:</b>	I didn't have a good day last Friday because I went to go see my friend [NAME OTHER] in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And we went over to [DEIDENTIFIED], and, uh, I always have a, I don't know why because she was a crack addict—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	But we just relate together so well.  I mean we're so similar in a lot of ways—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, she's married too, and [NAME OTHER]'s okay.  She knows it's a friend.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And we went to go see a friend that went back into [DEIDENTIFIED] for alcohol, and, uh, it was neat seeing the counselors and stuff I hadn't seen in a while.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, it's, it's kind of, uh, all right, he [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING].  Uh, she's, uh, but it's a lot of fun.  You know, she's, she's an alcoholic and, um, and then [NAME OTHER] was a crack addict and then I was doing prescription drugs and we would have never hung out together probably, but now we all have this common bond where it's all the same thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.  Yeah, it's good to find people that we share experiences with like who will understand and support us.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	How much sobriety do you have now?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, let's see on the [DATE], I'll have 5 months.
<b>DR:</b>	Five months on, uh, [DATE]?  Good.  Yeah because I'm guessing too probably you and [NAME OTHER] are probably 2 of the few that are still sober.  Is that true?  Do you know?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, me and [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER].  Um, yeah there's a few people that made it.
<b>DR:</b>	Out of how many were in the program when you were there?
<b>PT:</b>	Fifty.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah because the relapse rate is so high and so many people quit on their, working their programs, they relapse.  So that's good that you haven't quit because it destroys people and they relapse and keep going back and using again.  So, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I never, I mean I haven't gone to a meeting since the way that I felt, but I never, I mean I still get thoughts.  I mean I can't say I don't, but I, um, I can't give up because, you know, to give up for me would be to die.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  Yes.  And it would affect not just you, but [NAME OTHER].  You got to stay—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	To affect other people too.  I think that's one of the things that addicts start using drugs or alcohol is would become more self centered or some folks, we forget about how our behavior is affecting others, and so they get sober, they start, you know, feeling more connected with others and realizing that how we live our lives affect others negatively or positively and we can be a positive influence to people's lives, and there are lot of amazing people who are recovering addicts or alcoholics that have done incredible things for people because of the way they've lived their lives.
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	So, just reading some different accounts of [NAME OTHER]'s story about, you know, how he got sober, and thinking about how many lives he touched because he chose to get sober and stay sober, you know.  I mean its millions of people.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, it may not have seemed like a big thing to him at the time.  I don't know, but, uh, over, you know, over the years, it made a huge difference to a lot of people.  I think sometimes we don't always know how our choices now could have a profound positive influence on us later.  All your students that you're teaching, I mean if you dead from using, all your students would not benefit from what they're learning from you then.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and that would really hurt them.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  So—
<b>PT:</b>	Because they have fun when they come over.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	The little kids and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yep, and that, that wouldn't be available to them.  So, by you staying sober, you're not just helping yourself, you're doing positive for a lot of other people too.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's the thing they talk about all the time is, is how you can be helpful to other people.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, just about yourself.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	About myself.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Good.  So [PATIENT NAME] I think, I'm glad you're getting out and doing things like going and seeing [NAME OTHER] and going to football games.  I think that's real important even when you're depressed.  If you can, force yourself to get out and do things because it really help.  And the other thing, things that help are exercise.  It's really hard to exercise when feeling depressed.  Are you doing anything for exercise now?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Is there any kind of exercise that you like or enjoy?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, not really, huh.
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].  I'm really bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you even like walking or swimming or?
<b>PT:</b>	I like walking.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I mean walking is one of the best forms of exercise.  Um, I don't know how the weather's going to be today, but, you know, sometimes if people just get out and walk or even, you know, around the block or, you know, around their neighborhood just a little bit each day, their depression starts lifting because we're releasing endorphins and other chemicals in the brain that help lift us out of depression.
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, do you have a dog?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Do you walk your dog?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I, I used to, but she's got a hurt leg right now.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  So it's hard to take her out.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, do you and [NAME OTHER] ever enjoy going on walks together?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and we also have a treadmill too.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	That I can listen to music on when I walk.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, and also people like to do treadmills with music or TV in the room or something just to distract them, but yeah, if you could do anything like that, that would help.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, what else helps?  Um, getting up out of bed or up out of the sofa, just getting up and moving even is good or getting outside because when you're at home on the sofa, are the curtains or drapes pulled?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I like it dark.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, a lot of people do when they're depressed.  The problem is then your body and brain aren't getting the things, you need the sunlight because sunlight also helps with depression for many people especially in the winter months.  So if you can even get outside 15, 20 minutes a day or open the curtains for a little bit, it may start to lift the depression by producing those chemicals your body needs again.  Um, so those are some things you can do just to try to get to feeling better.  I don't think you're drinking any alcohol either, are you?
<b>PT:</b>	Alcohol?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh no.
<b>DR:</b>	I didn't think so.  I'm just thinking about things that could, you know, interfere with the depression.  Um—
<b>PT:</b>	If I drank, that would be a slip for me if I had that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	It would get me right back to where I was.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yep.  Uh, what else?  Are things going okay between you and [NAME OTHER] right now?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, everything's going really well.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just kind of weird because you get this, it's like this hopeless feeling, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	And it feels dark and, um, you know, you don't want to feel it.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and that's what it—
<b>DR:</b>	That's the depression, yep.  Yeah, it kind of sucks the life out of us when we're depressed.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, so [PATIENT NAME] I'm thinking again of things to do, or if you can, get some kind of exercise, sunlight exposure, social contacts, be around people, go to games, you know, teach lessons, go see [NAME OTHER] and do things like that that can help.  We'll bump up the Wellbutrin, see if that'll help.  Uh, and getting a good night's sleep is really important.  Do you ever take antihistamines over the counter like Benadryl?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I have, uh, when I take, uh, Clarinex.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, and that's not sedating usually.  Have you ever taken Benadryl?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Does it make you tired or sleepy?
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Do you remember?
<b>PT:</b>	No, it might make me a little drowsy, but not—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, because some people take it at higher doses for sleep.  Um, you know, at lower doses, it works great as an antihistamine.  At higher doses, it's more sedating and a lot of people find if they take 50, which is 2 tablets, or 75, which is 3 tablets, um, that it really helps them get to sleep and stay asleep.  Have you ever tried that?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I never tried it at a high dose.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you want to try that for sleep?  It's very safe.  It doesn't usually cause a hangover.  That would be one option if you want to try it.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, what would be the other option?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I'm still thinking about an option.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, sorry.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, no it's okay.  I'm thinking of what else, well, there's some other medicines like Rozerem, have you heard of that, but it takes a long time to work off, and so I don't think it's a good choice for you.  Well, there's Sonata.  Have you heard of it?
<b>DR:</b>	Sonata's a short acting one.  I don't know if you ever tried it.  The problem, the good thing about Sonata is it doesn't cause the morning grogginess.  The bad thing is it usually wears off after about 4 hours.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	So I don't know if it would get you through that initial waking up phase, and then keep, and then if you'd stay asleep naturally on your own, you know, after that because the medicine will be out of your system.  See the good thing about Sonata though is if you wake up during the night and you have at least 4 more hours to sleep, you can take another dose of it during the night to get you back to sleep.  Um, I've been told the astronauts take it out in the space shuttle because they're going on the earth every one point something hours.  They have a sunrise and a sunset every hour, so it really messes up their sleep.  So they something to help them sleep, but they also need something that isn't going to make them impaired mentally if they have to wake up, if there's an emergency, and they don't want them to sleep too long, so they use Sonata because they can get a good, a good restful sleep and then wake up and be alert.  So that's another prescription sleep medicine that's not addictive that we could use.  My only hesitation with about it, my only hesitation about it is that it tends to wear off after 4 hours, so I don't know if you'd stay asleep naturally for the rest of the night or if you'd wake up after 4 hours.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	But again, if you did wake up, you can take another one.  So that would be another option.  Um—
<b>PT:</b>	And that, you know that, that doxepin really works so well.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	You know.  Is it sometimes worth just to, um, saying okay, I'm going to gain some weight?
<b>DR:</b>	Well it depends.  I mean how much are you weighing now, do you know?
<b>PT:</b>	I think I've come down a little bit.  I think I weigh 170.
<b>DR:</b>	Well it's, it's an option if you want to.  We can always go back to it and just monitor your weight because I don't want you to keep going up too high because that can cause other health problems, but yes, that's always an option.  So if you want to go back to it.  Do you still have some doxepin at home?  Is that what you want to do, or do you want to try something else?
<b>PT:</b>	You know it's kind of a real mix for me because there's such a, it really keeps me asleep the whole night.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	"And it even seems like it helps with depression.	"
<b>DR:</b>	It is an antidepressant also, yes.
<b>PT:</b>	And it seems like it works with the Paxil really well.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, and that's a good point.  It may be that part of the reason you feel more depressed is because you've gotten off the Doxepin.  Um, you know, we could go back on the Doxepin for, for your sleep and for depression and just monitor your weight closely to make sure it doesn't go up too high.  Do you want to do that?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's probably, I think that's, I mean I have to just buckle down and stay with that, I guess.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And it's inexpensive too.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, that's, that's a big advantage.  Okay, let me, let me write this down.
<b>PT:</b>	That the, maybe when that started wearing off or something.
<b>DR:</b>	It could be when the doxepin kind of got out of your system.  Yeah, but not only did it not help you sleep because it wasn't in your system, but the depression could have gotten worse.  Now, let me see what dose you were taking.  I had down 50 mg and you were taking up to 3 at bedtime.  Do you want to stay with that same dosage range?  Does that seem like it worked okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, it seemed to work real well at that dose.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well let's do both then.  Let's, now do you still want to go up on the Wellbutrin also just to see if it'll help pull you out of the depression?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, why don't we go ahead and try that then.  Okay, I'll give you the prescription.  Yeah, so hopefully between the Wellbutrin increase and getting back on the Doxepin, hopefully that'll help.  Also Wellbutrin, for some people, can decrease appetite a little bit.  So maybe the higher dose of Wellbutrin may reduce the weight gain possibly.  I can't promise that, but it might help.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So we'll see how that works and adjust as we need to as well.  That sounds like a plan.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So what else is going on?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, not much else is really going on.  You know, I was working on, on this stuff in here, but I haven't worked on it in a, in a while.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, some of the self critical thoughts or is this, what do you have written?
<b>PT:</b>	No, it's the stuff I was doing in that book.  Uh, um, I think we, last time we talked about naming and refocusing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, does the Paxil also help with obsessive?
<b>DR:</b>	It tends to, yes, or it can.  Do you feel like it's helping?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	You can't tell.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I, I didn't know, I remember one time you gave me a medication called, uh, fluvoxamine.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Is that a better one than Paxil or they're the same?
<b>DR:</b>	They're similar, but different.  So some people do better with one or the other.  So there's one not that's consistently better than the other, it just depends on the individual.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you feel like maybe the fluvoxamine helped you more with the—
<b>PT:</b>	With the obsessive.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you, well, I was going to say do you feel like you want to go back to it.  Like the Luvox is also better, or fluvoxamine, is also typically better for sleep.  Um, I'm just thinking we're making so many changes, I'm a little hesitant to make a third change too.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I understand.
<b>DR:</b>	But at some point, do you feel like that's something you'd maybe like to consider going back to?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think it, I think it helps me with the, um, you know, I think it helped me with that a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, but I just wanted to ask because I, I still have, I know [NAME OTHER] has a big bottle of it at home, and, um, that we had from when I took it before.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And—
<b>DR:</b>	Well [PATIENT NAME] what we might do then is give it these 2 weeks to get you back on the doxepin and try the higher dose of Wellbutrin and see how you're doing, and then once you've been stabilized a couple of weeks, if you're still feeling like you want to try the fluvoxamine, we could do that next time maybe.  So next week, next time is Thanksgiving I think.  Maybe the next time we meet at least.  No, not next week.
<b>PT:</b>	Is next week Thanksgiving?
<b>DR:</b>	I have to look and see.  I'm not sure I'm going to schedule, but, uh, it's something we could certainly look at and consider switching you back if you want to try that.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I just remembered you were saying that they both work with the, uh, is it serotonin?
<b>DR:</b>	Yes, Uh-huh.  Yeah, and the medicines that increase serotonin tend to be the best at helping with obsessive thoughts.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, part of it I think with the eating, I was talking with my sponsor, is it's like my addiction is, is still active even though I'm not drinking or using drugs, but I'm looking for things that will make me feel good.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, externally and, and so food will do that, or, you know, maybe even sleep would, would take away that, that feeling.  You know, the, trying to sleep or, um, anything else that'll bring like immediate gratification.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, and I, I think that could be part of it too.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So maybe just looking for some sort of way to feel better.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Which is why people use drugs a lot of time, but it is also why people use food sometimes or sleep or other things too.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, the key is to find healthy ways to feel good that don't have side effects, and side effects like drugs do or like the overeating does or oversleeping.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I guess as I keep working the steps, that's going to get better.
<b>DR:</b>	It should, yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Because we're going to do the third step I think this week.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Remind me, do you remember what the third step is?
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	If you don't, I've got my book here, but—
<b>PT:</b>	Any decision to turn our world or our lives over to the care of God is [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  So, and are you doing that when you see your sponsor at meetings?  Are you getting together outside of meetings?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we get out together outside of the meetings.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b>	And, and talked about, you know, uh, the steps and—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And the book and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  So do you feel pretty comfortable with him as a sponsor?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, you know, it's kind of weird because I feel like he's an authority figure.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	He's not, he's a really nice guy.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	But I tend to get that feeling anyways.
<b>DR:</b>	Is he older than you?
<b>PT:</b>	No, he's probably younger than me.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So do you know what it is about him that you see him as an authority figure?
<b>PT:</b>	He's real confident and, um, you know, confident kind of person.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, and he's more of a laid back I think person.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, but how much sobriety does he have, do you know?
<b>PT:</b>	Gosh, he's got, uh, I don't know if it's, I think '93.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, '93.
<b>DR:</b>	He's like 15 years.  So that's a lot of sobriety.  So that's, and his was with prescription drugs?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, he did alcohol, uh, crack cocaine and other things like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And whatever he could get.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so he's got a pretty good history of sobriety, which is good.  So just as authority, so it's more just his demeanor and his personality you feel like, rather than his age?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And so it that, um, seeing him as an authority figure, does that feel like a negative or a positive experience for you or neutral?
<b>PT:</b>	You know, it makes me nervous to call especially if I haven't done something I should have done like go to a meeting or, but that's probably part of why he wants me to call.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So I keep in contact and I'm doing the things I should be doing.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, and does it feel like you're nervous to call because you feel like he's going to be upset with you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And does he get upset with you?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So that's what they call projection where we expect something out of someone, whether it's true of them or not, and it's usually based on our past experience.  So through your past experience with authority figures is they're going to get upset with you if you don't do something you're supposed to do, they you'll project that onto him and expect the same out of him even though you may not be that way.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So [PATIENT NAME] the good thing is the more experience you have with him, positive experiences, maybe the more that'll shift for you where you won't come to expect that out of authority figures anymore.  Um, yeah, I've even felt that between you and I at times that you felt like I was going to get angry at you for something that was kind of a normal human thing to do.  Do you remember that at times?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, I'm hoping that maybe in different relationships that you have, do you see me as an authority figure?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So maybe in, in a relationship that you have with people that you see as authority figures, hopefully they'll be more positive experiences where if you don't do something that you think you're supposed to do, people don't get upset with you or punish you or blame you or anything, just understanding and supportive that maybe that'll start to shift where you won't be so worried about, you know, reaching out and using people for support when you need it.  Does that make sense?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, then it's hard, hard being honest and, and those kind of things.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because in your experiences, if you were honest with your parents, what would happen?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'd be bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you getting punished or get hurt.  Okay, yeah, so you're doing a good job of working to change those patterns in your brain, those expectations.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I think, um, you know, uh, one of the things that bothers me, and I am sorry for what I, what I did, but you know, with the prescriptions that I got from you, misusing them.  You know, that was the wrong thing to do.  You know, I'm sorry about that.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, [PATIENT NAME] your apology is accepted, but you don't, you know, it's, you don't even owe me an apology I don't think.  I mean, but it's, it's something that happens to people.  It happens to a lot of good people, that people start using medications and then they feel better, so they want to use more and more, and sometimes our brains just kick in to this gear where we don't think about the consequences to ourselves or to others and we just keep going.  And you didn't hurt me or harm me in any way, so, um, I just feel badly for you that, you know, it could have killed you.  I'm glad it didn't, and I'm glad that you're working so hard on your sobriety because it's a way, you can turn a really negative experience into a really positive experience, not just for you, but for other people too.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, you know, it was kind of weird how it started because I was taking the medication as I was supposed to.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And something got in my head and, and was like I can get [NAME OTHER]'s, you know, syringes and I could do that.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, you know, it was just insanity to me.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it is.  Our brain sometimes tells things that aren't good things.  You know, they can play tricks, our brains can play tricks on us.  They do all the time, and if they trip, trip us up, we can start doing things that are not healthy or even dangerous, or even deadly.  And, uh, the problem is that once we start going down those paths, sometimes our brain just keeps reinforcing the same kinds of thoughts.  And that's why people get addicted to things.  They keep telling themselves things that aren't true and they keep living their lives that way.  It's sad and scary.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It's gotten some really good people, and there are a lot of wonderful addicts.  You know, great wonderful people and boy, when they're into their addictions, they're not people you want to be around because they lie.  They steal.  They cheat.  They, you know, and it's not, that's not their normal personality.  It's the addictive personality that takes over.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm learning to change a lot of the things.  I'm, I'm being more honest.  I still catch myself—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, doing stuff or doing something I shouldn't do, but they're getting farther and farther between.  The thing is I keep working steps and everything.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, I guess it's a process.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	It isn't like one day I, I always expect, okay, I'm clean now, everything's going to be perfect, and it's not like that.
<b>DR:</b>	No, it is definitely a process.  It's a matter of working at it and just making good choices, being honest and, with ourselves and others, and as we do that, life gets easier and easier because when we're lying or hiding an addiction, you know, it just makes life more and more difficult till eventually something gives, either it's our health or our relationships or something gives because it's just not sustainable.  People can't stay addicts forever.  Either they die or they get, you know, put in jail or they lose their relationships.  Something goes wrong or your health fails.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, it's just not a sustainable lifestyle.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm fortunate to, you know, I made my way through it and, uh, so I'm kind of the other things.  I, I still have my wife and everything.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  Well thank goodness you got help early enough because if it kept going, you probably wouldn't, you know.  You probably would have lost your wife and people lose their homes.  They lose everything.  It just, um, destroys people's lives.  So, but again, to your credit, you're turning it around turning it into something positive.
<b>PT:</b>	I guess I hid it from her.  She had no idea what I was doing.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I was hiding it from her—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	For so long.
<b>DR:</b>	And [PATIENT NAME] another thing is that addictions destroys trust like with spouses that don't know what's going on and they find out what was happening and they don't trust for a while, but you're rebuilding that trust again with [NAME OTHER] too where she's going to learn that, yeah, she can trust you because you are being honest with her.  As long as you keep being honest with her, it'll just keep building the trust back again, and that's one of the real cornerstones of a healthy marriage or relationship is there's got to be trust because if that's not there, the marriage isn't healthy.  So—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're rebuilding it, so that's good.  That's really good.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know I'm having a really, um, I'm having a really hard time with intimacy with [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	It's like I'm, I shut myself off, but—
<b>DR:</b>	What, emotional or sexual or both?
<b>PT:</b>	Both.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And do you know what that's about that you're shutting yourself off from her?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know.  It's like this, this fear that I have.  Um, you know, I, um, I, I think, um, well one of the, one of the things is, um, you know, I've never, I was always, I was always around my family and stuff like that, and, uh, I was, and there was always, um, a lot of things around, things around the house and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, pornography and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, you know, I don't know why, but since I got out, when I got out of rehab, I started looking at it on the internet.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I think I have like guilt and stuff over it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Is [NAME OTHER] how does she feel about you looking at pornography?
<b>PT:</b>	She doesn't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Does she agree with it or doesn't like it?  Oh, she doesn't know.  Do you have a guess about how she would react if she found out?  Would she be okay with it or would she be upset?
<b>PT:</b>	Upset.
<b>DR:</b>	She would be, okay.  Okay, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	And then that's something I feel I, that I need to stop because, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Because?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, because one thing it makes me feel ashamed.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I don't, I don't really like it and, you know, I want to have intimacy with my wife.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, okay.  [PATIENT NAME] if you were to look at, um, pictures on the internet that were sexually stimulating, but not pornography, would you feel guilty then?
<b>PT:</b>	Probably not.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, so, um, like if you watch a, a movie that's not pornography, but it's, you know, um, maybe an erotic movie or a romance or something that involves nudity, do you feel guilty about that?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And if you and [NAME OTHER] watched something like that together, do you feel embarrassed or guilty about that?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't think I would.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So if they show like a lovemaking scene that's well done and tasteful and all, that's okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So there's some line there that gets crossed then for you where you start to feel guilty about it, okay.  And do you know what that line is?  Do you know where is it okay and where is it not okay for you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What's, what's the difference?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, where it goes from being tasty and stuff to that to just being elicit.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, um, because what I'm thinking about is it's normal for people to enjoy looking at, um, stimulating movies, for example, or pictures.  That's just human nature.  I mean men like to see attractive women walking down the street, they turn and look and women do the same, and that's not abnormal, but there is some line that people cross sometimes where they feel guilty about that, or feel uncomfortable with it, and I think, you know, for example, in some cultures where people don't wear clothes, you know, like in Africa or the Amazon, people don't think it's bad or guilty to look at nude bodies because it's normal.  So we create some division in our minds about what's okay and what isn't, and there are a couple of ways of handling that.  One is either to stay on the side that's okay and look at those things that we feel okay about, and we don't feel guilty about, so we don't have to feel guilty.  Um, or the second is to find some way to feel, to have a healthy relationship with, uh, with nudity or sexuality.  Um, so I mean for you maybe is there, you know, I know a lot of kids used to look at National Geographic and feel guilty looking at nude, you know, people in Africa or something because they were looking at nude bodies and, and that was a, a bad thing.  Well now people don't necessarily think of that as a bad thing.
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	And nudity in and of itself, isn't.  It's maybe how it's portrayed or how's it done.  Like you said if it's tasteful or distasteful, that's either an upset.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, um, what I hear you saying too though is looking at the pornography takes away from your relationship with [NAME OTHER] too, is that right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I feel—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So is there a way that you could take that desire, that interest, and channel it back into your marriage with [NAME OTHER]?  I mean could the two of you look at, um, romantic or sensual movies that aren't pornographic, for example?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we could do that.
<b>DR:</b>	Do, do you rent movies?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, sometimes we do.
<b>DR:</b>	Like at Blockbuster or something?  Do you ever pick movies that are sensual or maybe a little erotic, but not pornographic?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, not usually.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, and who picks the movies?  Do you or does she, or do you kind of do it together?
<b>PT:</b>	It usually comes down to [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, she usually picks them?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So if you were to suggest to her a movie that looked kind of sensual, but, or erotic, but not pornographic, do you think she'd be open to watching it with you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she probably would.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, because you might try that sometime.  It might be a way just to increase the intimacy because sometimes seeing a movie like that kind of opens us up a little bit and helps us feel more relaxed about it.  Um, does that make sense?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I don't know of any movies off the top of my head to even suggest, but you might just go to Blockbuster sometime and see.  Let's find something a little different this weekend and just see if we find something that we like.  I'm trying to think what else could you do?  So you could watch movies that are tasteful.  Um, what else?  Well, here's another one.  A lot of the men looking at the, um, like looking at the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition.  Do you feel guilty about looking at that?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	No and because it's tasteful—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Reasonably tastefully done.  Okay, so, um, and for a lot of men, if they look at pictures like that, women in swimsuits, they get sexually aroused and  they're interested then, and they can use that energy, or sexual energy to channel it back into their marriage.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Does that ever work for me?  I mean if you look at pictures like that, then do you feel like you want to be more intimate with [NAME OTHER] or not necessarily?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, you know, it, it's really been a struggle because my whole life has, was really dysfunction.
<b>DR:</b>	I understand.
<b>PT:</b>	And, and I think it's always been hard for me to even before, I don't know why this happened after, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED], but even before that, it's always been hard for me to connect emotionally and, and physically.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I just want to shut myself off like I have shame or I have, uh, you know, I wonder if I could, if I even did that so, to even make myself feel more ashamed.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you just feel ashamed about sex in general?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You know, but [PATIENT NAME], another option would be to even think about getting a couple of books like The Joy of Sex.  Do you know about that book?  There's some books that are tastefully done by therapists or doctors about sexuality that, you know, are not intended to be pornographic at all.  They're intended to help people develop healthy sexual relationships, and it might even be worth, I don't think I have it here.  It might even be worth getting a book like that and having it at home just so you can read about it, or they have some pictures that, again, are tastefully done and not pornographic, of sketches or drawings of things, um, just showing different sexual positions, for example, and talk about what is healthy sexuality.  Do you think something like that would maybe help transition from feeling ashamed to feeling more positive?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, maybe that would help.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	But something to change the, the way I've been trained or whatever.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  So a couple of suggestions you might try.  One would be to pick out a movie that's sexual, but in a tasteful way, and there are a lot of movies like that, you know, that are not pornographic movies and they have a theme to the movie and they have a plot, but there may be some erotic scenes in it or something that are tastefully done.  So just to kind of open up to that again, or maybe getting a book like The Joy of Sex, for example, that's tastefully done, that just talks about sexuality and what is healthy sexuality and it might help you kind of, like you said, overcome some of that shame or guilt that you feel, that you were conditioned to feel.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's, that's what it really comes down to, that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So do you want to maybe consider trying either a movie or a book—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And just seeing how that works for you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And then let me know if it, if it helps or not, and if it does, we can keep going, and if it doesn't, we can try something else.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So yeah, let's work on intimacy, sexual and emotional intimacy too.  Um, and I think a lot of emotional intimacy involves we need to feel safe, and we need to be able to be honest and open.  So, yeah, if you're feeling guilty about looking at pornography, that's going to shut down intimacy because you're not going to feel open to talk about that.  So if we can shift away from pornography into other healthy sexual expressions, it's going to be easier to be open with [NAME OTHER] just open verbally and emotionally, which will create more emotional intimacy too because you won't feel that guilt or shame.  Does that sound okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b>	That's, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Excellent.  All right, well I guess we're out of time.  Is there anything else you wanted to talk about that we haven't yet?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I, um, no I guess, you know, I was just, you know, I guess [INAUDIBLE] being sober it's, it's weird, but I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	What do you mean?
<b>PT:</b>	At the beginning of it, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	There's so many weird, you're not using anymore and it's like all these things and it's like—
<b>DR:</b>	A lot of shifting in your life?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.  There's a lot of change, a lot of growth too.  So I think you are growing [PATIENT NAME].  The fact that we've been talking about some of these issues like sexuality and, and looking at the depression, I mean those are all good signs because if you were just using all the time, you'd be numbed out to all these things.  We wouldn't be working on them.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So it's a good sign.  So let's see here, now, um, I guess Thanksgiving is actually 2 weeks away.  I was going to say now many more sessions do we have left?  Today is the 27th session.  Um, so we have 3 more, 3 more this year before you run out of your insurance allotted sessions.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, and 2 weeks I'm going to be out of town.  Do you want to meet next week, which is the [DATE]?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and then 2 weeks of December.
<b>DR:</b>	And then, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And then we'll be leaving for Florida.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, that's right.
<b>PT:</b>	On the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Does that work out?
<b>DR:</b>	There are actually 3, um, Tuesdays in December, the [DATE], [DATE], and [DATE].  So we could meet 2 of those 3 if you want.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And then you'll be leaving the [DATE] and be gone, and then [PATIENT NAME] when you come back, then you're going to have different insurance, is that right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you going to be changing doctors then?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so one of the things we should really look at maybe in December is, actually we want to look at it even next time, um, is who are some of those doctors on the list and seeing if maybe you can start making some phone calls now because a lot of the doctors have a long waiting list to get in if they're even taking new patients.  Just so you know, I mean if you can't get in to see someone, I'm not going to not be your doctor anymore.  You know, I could still [INAUDIBLE] I'd be happy to see you, but I know your insurance probably won't cover it.  Who's your new insurance through?
<b>PT:</b>	Aetna.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, with Aetna, it depends on your plan.  Sometimes they cover part of the visits, but not as much since I'm not in the network, but anyway, I just want to reassure you that you're not going to be without a doctor in the interim, but it may take a while to get in to see someone too.  So, I just want to make sure that maybe we get that, uh, process started before we get to January, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	That'll be good.  So I will see you next week then.  If there's anything you need before then, oops, just give me a call, okay?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm taking the Wellbutrin and—
<b>DR:</b>	Back on the doxepin then.  Yeah, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All right [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b>	All right, thanks.
<b>DR:</b>	You bet.  Have a good week.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Bye bye.
<b>PT:</b>	Bye.
