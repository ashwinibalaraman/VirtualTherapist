PATIENT: (2-minute silence) Something that's been on my mind all day and I don't know exactly how to — well, I, I don't know exactly what it is but it's just a continuation of what was bothering me last week: uhm, the relationship MSCZ and I have and the sort of confused feelings I have about how, how I just can relate to him.  And it just, it's just this sort of a vague feeling of being very unhappy with how things are and sort of a vague disquiet.  And I don't, I can't, I keep thinking about, thinking, well, what in particular is it that is happening or that disturbs me about it.  And somehow again it's being unable to need him, in a way.  I have to fight against him.  (Sniffle)
Or sometimes I can't tell whether I'm fighting to feel something for him when I don't or whether I'm fighting against feeling things that I do feel.  Because there are times when I feel extremely fond of him and very close and just very contented and happy about the fact that we're together.  And, and so then it makes me think well, how can I feel that and at other times feel nothing if, if the nothing is what really is our relationship.  Or I wonder, how can I feel nothing at times if our relationship is really based on a very close feeling. (Silence)
And it's almost that I want to, when I'm feeling this feeling of fighting against him or wanting to fight against him, very often I just sort of fall into being quite passive and I don't know whether it's because I'm afraid of what I'll do if I let my emotions out.  But there are times when, if we're disagreeing or even sometimes when he wants to have intercourse and I am first trying to and then I just feel as if I want to hurt him.  And he often says well, I want to castrate him.  And I suppose in a way I do, although I don't know quite what that would mean.  But I just don't understand what happens.  I can go from feeling about as warmly as I ever do to him to just suddenly wanting to hurt him.  And, and it'll just happen so quickly.
ANALYST:  It happened, I gather, this weekend.
PATIENT: Mm.
ANALYST:  Do you remember the details?
PATIENT: Well, it happened when, again, we were going to have intercourse and at, at first it was more me turning to him, partly because I suppose in a way I feel that I should because there are so many times, times when don't.  And I, and I did sort of want to turn to him then, too.  Although it was, it was I would think well, I'd like to and then immediately I would feel, oh no, I don't want to.  And finally I just did because I thought I've got to stop thinking this way.  And, and, and then as soon as I did I felt as if I couldn't go through with it.  And, I don't know, MSCZ sometimes feels that if he just makes me go through with it, that eventually I won't be having this reaction that I have.
And this particular time it just seemed as if he were being extremely aggressive and as if he didn't really care what I was doing.  And it made me really want to fight him.  (Clears throat) And I would start to and then I'd stop.  And, and it got to the point — this isn't the only time that's happened — so this time MSCZ said, "Well, if you want to hit me, hit me.  If you want — whatever you want to do, do it and sort of get the feeling out of you, whatever it is."  And I, and then I just couldn't do anything and I couldn't even tell how I felt.  Or what I wanted to do.  And then after I've resisted him or fought him or whatever it is I'm doing to him, rejected him, or whatever and the thing has gotten totally unpleasant and he withdraws from me and uses some threat of, of various kinds that make me feel guilty, then I, then I can respond to him.  And then we can have intercourse and, and it's not something that I have to resist.  And sometimes I can actually enjoy it.  But I, I have to have this other thing happen first.  So that, so that I feel guilt enough or I don't know whether it's just making me feel guilty enough so then I stop having to fight him or, or if I've felt I've put him down and I don't have to put him down any more, or what it is.
But, or sometimes we'll just have an argument (clears throat).  Or sometimes if we're just having an argument, completely unrelated to having intercourse or anything after the argument, which can sometimes — generally it doesn't become a physical kind of fight but occasionally it has and I've wanted very much to hurt him then.  And then afterwards I can feel very affectionate to him.  And —
ANALYST:  When you wanted to hurt him, what did you want to do?
PATIENT: Well, I always want to hit him, I guess.  Or kick him.  And I feel as if — I don't know whether this is what I really feel — but it always seems if I hit him anywhere but on his penis it will not hurt him, really.  So then I always try to hit him there.  Which is one reason why I think he thinks that I always try to castrate him.  I suppose in a way, I — I mean it is where I concentrate trying to hurt him.  And then it bothers me that I'm like that so then I'll go through a long time when I'll just any time when there could be any kind of an argument or any time there might be feelings I sh—,, that would be sort of aggressive in that way that I'd let out, I'll, I'll just remain very passive and not, I won't get into an argument or if, if it's, again, a situation where we'd be having intercourse and I'd want to do that, I just will lie there and —  (P�use)
And I know that I, well, for, ever since we've been married it's, there's been this kind of pattern.  And just from the way I felt today, I know that in the past I just wouldn't think about it afterwards.  Because somehow, when I try to think about it I just feel in such a conflict.  And, and I don't know what, what the things are that are conflicting within me and so I just put it off.  And today, well, since I've been coming here, I've been feeling more and more that you just can't keep putting things off and not thinking about them.  And it just, I felt so distracted from my job at school because I, I just, at this point, this thing was vaguely in my mind and I wanted to handle it.  And I couldn't think about it at, while I was at school and I couldn't think about things at school because this was on my mind.  And yet if I really try to think about it I just, I don't know what to come to terms with. (P�use)
It's almost another aspect of sometimes when MSCZ wants to have intercourse and I'm just being kind of passive, not, not as bad as when I feel in the mood I've just been describing but sort of well, I haven't made up my mind that I want to or don't want to, I'm just neutral over it.  And sometimes when I feel that I'm beginning to enjoy the whole physical relationship then I can also feel at the very same time something else in me not letting me enjoy it.  And then eventually, again I might have to fight him and resist him until it gets so bad that again I begin to feel guilty.  And then it might work out that I'll be able to do it with enjoyment.  But that time I could even be feeling pleasure and, and I won't let myself. (P�use)
And I don't know how much it has to do with this feeling I have about, if, if things get too intimate that if he, if, if I'm know too intimately by people that they'll think I'm ridiculous or stupid or clumsy, which, all of which I know I do feel and that it comes out time and time again that I don't want to reveal myself too much, I don't want anything between me and another person to become too intimate because I, I'm afraid I'll look that way.  And I think that's partly why I've often thought about, what will I do if I'm wearing boots and I come in here, that sitting here taking off boots would be too intimate a thing.  And I'll just feel stupid.  And I've just wondered how much of that is functioning in this inability to really participate in the, one of the most intimate things.
And one time when he wanted to have intercourse, I know that the only that came to my mind was, "It's just too intimate, it's too intimate."  When he was wanting to and I didn't want to.  And, again, I was just lying there not really fighting him, but just suddenly it just seemed to me everything's just too intimate.  And I suppose there's been on my part a feeling, too, that, that I won't be able to respond in a way that's really satisfying to him.  And it's almost as if I'm trying to make things bad enough so that then when he does complain or finds fault, I can see where there's good reason for him to.  And I won't have to face a certain inadequacy that I'm fearing.  But I don't see where it's really — I mean, I just think that's a part of it.  I don't, it doesn't seem that that would answer for the such a strong conflict that goes on.
And another thing that occurred to me this weekend when I was talking to a friend of mine about, uhm, well, some problem she's had with the birth control pills.  And, uhm, I've always had a, quite a large discharge, which has bothered me.  And, uhm, she said that when she began to have one that was when she really began to be worried and, uhm, then it made me think that years ago, and I don't remember just when it was but I was quite young, ah, I had a discharge that must have meant some kind of an infection because I used to have to have a douche with something in it so that it would take care of it.  And at the time I know I had this feeling that I must be, that it must be something just terribly wrong with me.  And the, besides the unpleasantness of having a douche, the only thing that I remember from all that is one day the nurse must have realized how upset I was about this because she just said something to me about that I shouldn't worry, that other people had this too or that it wasn't that unusual a thing and, because I thought it was just a very unique thing that I was the only one.  And the, that whole thing became very ugly to me and distasteful and now that I've been using the pills the discharge I've been having, especially at the beginning, bothered me terribly.  And that, it just made me feel very dirty and unclean and, again, I felt I must be the only one.
And sometimes that's what's bothered me about intercourse, the fact that afterwards, I'm left with something in me that's going to come out and, again, it makes me feel very unclean and messy.  And, I don't know, the whole thing often bothers me and sometimes I think for no other reason I don't want to have intercourse.  And that used to, that, the whole feeling of having something like that go into me used to bother me.  When I was in my teens I can remember once talking to a friend of mine and the thought that disturbed me so much was that I compared it to just having somebody urinate in me.  And I don't think, in a way, I've ever gotten rid of that feeling. (Silence)
But the thing that, superficially anyway, keeps bothering me is that whatever feeling I have for MSCZ just seems to be lost in all these, whatever else is behind my reaction to it.  And he's putting a lot of pressure on me now to work out what kind of feeling I do have for him so that we don't continue a marriage that may be something that's a relationship that should be broken up.  And I just, whenever he talks to me, it, it's very distressing to me.  And we did talk about it this weekend too because I don't feel I even know anymore. (P�use)
And sometimes the feeling that seems strongest when he thinks, when he says that he thinks perhaps we shouldn't remain together any longer, is, is a vision of being alone and having a horror of it and the fact that then I just close up in myself even more.  And aside form the fact that I'd have job that would take me out during the day, otherwise I would just completely cut off all contact with other people.  And then that is another confusing thing because then I don't know whether a thought of our separating is upsetting to me because I'd be alone and I'm afraid of being alone or whether it's also an, a very horrifying thought to me because I care about MSCZ.  And I suppose in a way these things put pressure on me too to, to keep trying to have intercourse with him in a more normal way than I can and that just makes it worse. (Silence)
I suppose in a way I think, I just think of intercourse as being very unclean and ugly.  And I want as little contact with the whole process as possible, or anything to do with it.  I just want to be as distant from it as I can.  (3-minute silence) I just keep thinking how awful things are right now and how unpleasant the whole atmosphere is and how I just, I just keep acting whatever way I'm acting, or treating MSCZ in whatever way I am that is so upsetting to both of us.  And I can't seem to stop even when I see how horrible it is for him.  I was just wondering how will I be tonight when I see him.  Will I start by almost picking a fight with him or at least being in some kind of a moody state?  Or will I be nice to him or will I feel aggressive toward him or will I feel glad that he's there, or just what?  And I, it just seems no matter what we talk about and what happens, we're back to the same kind of relationship again even if temporarily we break it for a while.  (Silence) And I've done just now what I do so often when I'm thinking about this whole thing.  And it just gets so unpleasant to me that I start thinking about something else.
ANALYST:  And fall silent.
PATIENT: Well, it just seemed sort of off the point.  Uhm, I suppose in a at the beginning of the year.  And she came in today for, for the conference.  Way it's not because I was thinking about the woman whose husband died and in a way I was contrasting myself to her and myself, supposedly having everything that I could want and certainly nothing very terrible happening in my life and she's just lost her husband and she's having trouble with one of her legs now and par—, which is, is probably re—, emotional reaction — I shouldn't probably guess on it — but something to do with her nerves.  And it should to away but it, again, it's just another thing has to cope with.  And she was just very pleasant and, I don't know, cheerful would be too strong a word.  But, anyway, she is handling these things or she appears to be handling these things.  And she seems to have done a very nice job with her son.  And I suppose the contrast is how nicely she's handling all these things that are happening to her.  And I just don't feel I am at all.
And I suppose I was thinking, too, of the fact that her son is, is not a handsome boy but he has certain features that are very appealing and certain expressions that are really delightful.  And there's a lot of his mother in him.  And so seeing her made me realize this.  And I was, I guess in a way, comparing something that I find very attractive about her to me and finding myself very unattractive.
ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.
