BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	So, it's been a couple of years and you look the same.
<b>PT:</b>	The same.  Hopefully I've lost weight.  I don't know.  I go up and down, but, um, I'm back because, uh, I'm depressed and I know it.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you been over the time or it just started up or?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I think it just started up.  There's a lot of stress in my life.
<b>DR:</b>	That's what I was thinking about because of the kids.
<b>PT:</b>	The kids are all very sick.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Very stressful with the money.
<b>DR:</b>	What about the job?  You're not painting anymore?
<b>PT:</b>	Not painting.  I went back to insurance.  It was a real mess with that when I started.  Uh, I was in the union as a contactor, as a business owner and you have to pay in almost like $2,000 a month for benefits and pension, and, uh, I had gone back in between [DEIDENTIFIED] and the company I'm with now [DEIDENTIFIED] and to make a long story short, I left the union to go back to work to get benefits and a better job and et cetera, et cetera and they refused to pay the medical bills that I already paid to have paid.  So we have 3 or 4 months of $35,000 a month medical bills that have gone unpaid.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, you know, that's extremely stressful and that was 2 years or a year and a half or whatever it was I got off, and, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	It's still not resolved?
<b>PT:</b>	Not resolved.  Can't find a lawyer.  The unions are in a separate umbrella so to speak of the law and you have to be a specialist in it to fight them and they're very clever with people like me because they get in contact with all the lawyers that could possibly fight them and then you can't represent them, and anyway that's a big mess and still is.  So we haven't really found a lawyer and we've looked through dozens.  Anyway, um, money's really bad.  My job is very stressful.  You know, I'm back in the insurance thing and all of a sudden they're back into this if you don't sell so much every couple of months, you're put on probation and a couple of months after that we're going to fire you.  It's cut and dry.  It's bottom line.
<b>DR:</b>	Is it commission?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I get a small salary and then it's a small amount of commission.  You know, the goal is always to build your book of business and live off commission because they pay you more and so on and so forth, but as I sit now, it'll probably be 4 or 5 years before I got to that point.  Even that, it don't equal probably what I'm making now.  In 4 or 5 years, I'd have to constantly deal with the stress of, you know, am I going to lose my job.  Um, I don't know.  There's just all kinds of things.  I'm supposed to get a big bonus check this month, thousands of dollars.  The client had an accident.  It's a profitability thing, so that's out the door.
<b>DR:</b>	You lost the bonus?
<b>PT:</b>	I lost the bonus because of one accident.
<b>DR:</b>	Hmm.
<b>PT:</b>	That legally wasn't even my client's fault.  It was somebody hit him, but they didn't have insurance.  So obviously we could have desperately used the money.  Um, you know, we had to refinance.  I just, I could go on and on about the terrible things that have happened in my—
<b>DR:</b>	What about that fund that the city had set up for you a long time ago?
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Could they, could they help you out with the $35,000?
<b>PT:</b>	The city didn't set it up.  Some friends of ours set it up and they raised money and that's dwindling now.  That's another thing.  It's down to thousands of dollars.  Um, there's no talk of doing a new one.  I don't know if they will or not.  It's too much for [NAME OTHER] and I to do on our own.  Um, my parents are both [AGE].  My Mom has, uh, they call it short term memory loss.  I don't know what you would call it, if it's dementia, early signs of Alzheimer's.  I don't know what the exact diagnosis would be, but it's getting worse and my Dad has some signs of it and he hurt his back.  So 2 weeks ago I had to go spend 48 hours in [DEIDENTIFIED] because they're down there by themselves.
<b>DR:</b>	Where are your sisters?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I have two sisters up here and one in New Jersey.  So, you know, they couldn't leave.  It was like a Wed, it was a Thursday and a Friday.
<b>DR:</b>	Are they still living together, your parents?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	In the house?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	How's your Mom's, the mood?
<b>PT:</b>	What was that?
<b>DR:</b>	Her mood, is she depressed?
<b>PT:</b>	No, she seems to have everything under control.  Um, she's on a lot of medicine and I couldn't even tell you what it is, but you know, I think she's just kind of so out of it that, you know, she falls asleep a lot and, you know.  When I was down there, I got there on like a Wednesday night and she slept the next day, Thursday until 4:00 in the afternoon, would have never got up at all.  Um, you know, and my own self diagnosis, I think I'm depressed because I feel like it.  I sleep every day.  You know, I'm tired all day long, take a nap.
<b>DR:</b>	You sleep to escape?
<b>PT:</b>	I think so.  Yeah, that's probably a good way to put it, just kind of shut down.  I just get exhausted.
<b>DR:</b>	You're never free from this.  The emotional burden is always on your shoulders.
<b>PT:</b>	No, it's never gone.
<b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER]'s not working, right?
<b>PT:</b>	She is, but she's only working part time this summer.  She works about 30 hours a week during the year and, you know, that's just not enough help and—
<b>DR:</b>	Um—
<b>PT:</b>	You know, the money.  I think we spend more than we make.  I mean it just never goes away, and the burden is, it's ungodly.  And it just catches up to me I guess.  I guess I am good for a while, and then—
<b>DR:</b>	How?  I mean what coping mechanisms have you used to handle it?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  Some of it was faith.  Some of it is getting away with my friends, playing softball.  I take a fishing trip once a year.  I take a golfing trip.  These are just a couple of days, but, um, actually I think talking to [NAME OTHER] helps me cope.  That's probably the number one thing I guess.  You know, a lot of times we'll just sit down and talk.
<b>DR:</b>	You both share the burden together?
<b>PT:</b>	Both share the burden.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you close to each other now?
<b>PT:</b>	We are.  We had a lot of trouble about a year ago.  We had to refinance.  Uh, [NAME OTHER] was spending like over $1,000 a month in credit cards on God knows what, and, um, you know, we've had our ups and downs and right now, it's pretty good.
<b>DR:</b>	The spending stopped on her part?
<b>PT:</b>	I guess it has, you know.  She kind of keeps things to the side and, you know, all of a sudden I find out about them, but—
<b>DR:</b>	I wonder if that's her stress reliever to spend.
<b>PT:</b>	It must be, you know.  Unfortunately a lot of people around us have wealth and, you know, there seems to be some correlation where she feels she—
<b>DR:</b>	Keep up with the—
<b>PT:</b>	Keep up with the Joneses so to speak where I never felt that way.  Um, you know, and I think some of it's guilt.  I have that guilt.  Our kids are sick.  They don't have, you know, I can't give them what the kids that go to school.  You know, I think there's some guilt associated with it.  It's just, I don't know.  I could talk for 10 hours about the problems.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you cry?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, rarely, very rarely.
<b>DR:</b>	So you keep it in?
<b>PT:</b>	Keep it in.  I cried the other day and that's the first time I can remember crying for months or a year.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you remember what triggered it?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I was alone in my office.  I work in an office pretty much by myself, and, uh, I don't remember what triggered it.  You know, it's just one of those things you start talking to yourself and it's just too much, and I don't remember exactly what I was crying about, but I was crying and I never really feel like I just break down and really cry it out, you know.  I never really feel like it's, I don't know how to explain that, but I never really feel like it's, it's enough of a release, you know, it's enough.
<b>DR:</b>	Well the question is how do you fix it?  I mean do you try to switch jobs to make more money or?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm trying.  That's the other thing.  I'm going—
<b>DR:</b>	Do you miss the painting or not, no?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, not, I miss the freedom of it.  I miss part of it.  I miss being self employed.  It was, it was convenient.  It was good.  It was, you know.  I miss that part of it, but you know, I don't miss so much dealing with people, collecting money, some of the problems.  I mean it's kind of like the buck stops with you.  It's kind of nice not always to have that.
<b>DR:</b>	You could leave.  Now you go to work, you come home, you're done with it?
<b>PT:</b>	Pretty much.  I mean the burden of, the financial end of it doesn't go away because I leave, but yeah, I don't, I don't have to worry so much, you know, what the next day brings because I know what it's going to bring.
<b>DR:</b>	You were able to keep the house though, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's going to be a struggle the way it is, and that's the only thing, the stress has really built up.  Um, you know, I'm looking for another job.  I've got to make more money.  Um, I can't go to work as unhappy as I am especially in sales.  I mean, you know, you can't be depressed and unhappy.  That kind of shows.  Um, so, you know, I know one of the top stressful things in life is changing jobs.  You know, certainly having sick kids and everything we go through, um, you know, [NAME OTHER] has diabetes on top of everything else, so there's been a few times the ambulance has come.  She's passed out.
<b>DR:</b>	How old is she?
<b>PT:</b>	She's [AGE] as of yesterday.
<b>DR:</b>	It's all the burdens.  You've got more than your share of burdens.  There's no question about it.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you get support from your sisters in any way?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't get along with them.
<b>DR:</b>	The oldest one you used to get along with.
<b>PT:</b>	I still talk to the oldest one.  I talk to my middle one in New Jersey.  I, I still see them from time to time.  I mean we had Christmas this year and they were all there.  Um, kind of buried the hatchet because my parents were there.
<b>DR:</b>	Kind of what?
<b>PT:</b>	Buried the hatchet, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Why, why are they angry?
<b>PT:</b>	Why are they angry with me?  I think there's a lot of issues from childhood where they think that I'm the youngest, and, uh, the only boy and my Dad treated me better.  Um, I had a fight with my sister about 15 years ago.  I don't know if you remember this.
<b>DR:</b>	With the drinking.  I remember yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, it's just really bad, and, you know, she's never forgiven, and I, I don't know if I've ever forgiven her.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you ever talk it through?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, no, not really.  Just kind of let time heal it.  Um, they get together once a year in New Jersey and they've never invited us for 15 years.  They take their kids.  My parents have gone, but they've invited me or my kids once, and, uh, I'm resentful and angry and all of that, but I just, I don't deal with it.  I mean I don't know why I don't deal with it.  I guess I don't know how to deal with it, and I feel like I have so many other things to deal with, I can't take the emotion and put everything aside and say I'm going to deal with this issue and I don't know if it would be resolved anyway because I just think that, you know, I'd get angry all over again, and it's just like, um, when I started my new job in November of '06, within a few days [NAME OTHER] found out about the union thing that I talked about where they're not going to pay anymore benefits and so on and so forth, and I was, you start the job here in 2 weeks in [DEIDENTIFIED], so I'm away from home and I get the call that this is going on, and I call and you know, all of a sudden it becomes this major thing.  And, um, while I'm there for the 2 weeks trying to get through the beginning of school and my new job, I'm dealing with this, and then my sister emails me that she's mad at me, the one in New Jersey, who I really don't get along with, that my parents have come up to visit us.  They take the train because it picks them up in [DEIDENTIFIED] which is a mile from home, and it brings them up to [DEIDENTIFIED].  In the past, they got off at [DEIDENTIFIED].  One of us would drive and physically pick them up.  Well, my Dad said well I'll just take the train to [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] and then I'm going to take the train out to [DEIDENTIFIED] and you pick me there.  It was 2 trains.  Well, she, you know, went off on me on that because I didn't go to [DEIDENTIFIED] to pick them up.  I'm not sure what that was all about.  That was going on the same time, so.
<b>DR:</b>	And she harbors resentment and looks for something to jump on you for.
<b>PT:</b>	She harbors resentment to me.
<b>DR:</b>	I said maybe from earlier childhood.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  She's, um, 5 or 6 years older than me.  I don't, the whole childhood thing, I just, I can't wrap my arms around.  I don't, I don't remember it being so well for me and so bad for them, but, you know.  Um, my oldest sister is 9 years older than me.  I don't even remember ever living with her, you know.  And yeah, I guess there's some resentment there, but you know, I feel like they're putting it on me when I didn't have anything to do with it, you know.  It's like well you got a baseball glove when you were [AGE].  I'm [AGE].  If somebody gives you a baseball glove—
<b>DR:</b>	Can't, can't you express that to her?  Let her think about it.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, if we could sit in a room like this and have a conversation, yeah, we could probably talk all of it out.  I believe that and they would be honest, and I would be honest.  I think we could have an adult, you know, a conversation and some things may be resolved.  Um, but that opportunity's never there and, you know, I think from my standpoint, there's 3 of them and one of me and I'd be in a room and within minutes I would feel like here they come, you know, and I would be defensive and, and angry and not very tolerant of what was going on.  So I don't know if it'll ever be resolved, and like I said, I just don't have the emotional energy to—
<b>DR:</b>	Not right now, no.
<b>PT:</b>	Not right now.
<b>DR:</b>	I can sense the heaviness.  I mean you definitely feel depressed.  So you haven't been taking antidepressants for years now, right?
<b>PT:</b>	No, you're the only person that's given me antidepressants.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm trying to think what was the most effective drug.  Prozac I think.
<b>PT:</b>	I think the only one I ever used was Prozac.  Um.
<b>DR:</b>	And it did help in the past.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it did.  When I first met you, I was very anxious and—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, there was agitation.  There was some concern about drinking.  There's not a drinking issue now?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  I mean I admittedly self medicated I think with drinking, but I was never, you know, when I got anxious, I had to drink 2 or 3 beers and that would kind of take care of, you know, whatever emotionally I needed it to you.
<b>DR:</b>	Temporarily, but when it wore off, you had a rebound depression.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, right, and had terrible anxiety attacks.
<b>DR:</b>	What about now?  Are you anxious?  Do you have problems sleeping?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah I have problems sleeping.  I have since been diagnosed with restless leg syndrome, and, uh, my family doctor gave me, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Requip.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's not Requip.  It's like, something like that.  I want to say it's Klonopin.
<b>DR:</b>	Klonopin, um.
<b>PT:</b>	I think it's a generic.  It's not—
<b>DR:</b>	Clonazepam, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	That's it.
<b>DR:</b>	They use that for restless leg.  It's for anxiety, but sometimes it can make the depression worse.  So are you taking that every night?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, it can make it worse, huh?  Yeah, he gives me the smallest amount and I take it.
<b>DR:</b>	Point five once every night.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And it helps you sleep?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it puts me to sleep.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, how long are you taking it now?
<b>PT:</b>	How long have I been taking it?  A couple of years.  There would be a period of time where I wouldn't take it at all at night, you know, and then—
<b>DR:</b>	The leg got worse.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know, you know.  There was a point where I'd wake up in the morning when I discovered that I was more tired than I went to bed, and I didn't know I had that, and uh—
<b>DR:</b>	More tired from the Klonopin or from the restless leg?
<b>PT:</b>	From the restless leg.  I didn't know I had restless leg, but I'd wake up and [NAME OTHER] would say my leg would tremble all night.  So then I went to see a family doctor and so on and so forth.
<b>DR:</b>	And the Klonopin controls it?  You're not kicking?
<b>PT:</b>	I suppose so, yeah.  I don't think I do anyway.  I don't know that much about the disease, but I think it kind of comes and goes I guess.  And it can be stress related.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	But, yeah, that you mention it, I take 1, you know, the smallest dose, I think it's a 1/2 mg.
<b>DR:</b>	Half a mg.
<b>PT:</b>	Almost every night.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that can make you over time more depressed too.  What about exercise?  Are you doing any exercise?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Walking, biking, or anything?
<b>PT:</b>	I think about it.
<b>DR:</b>	Because that's the best natural antidepressant.
<b>PT:</b>	I know, but [INAUDIBLE] people that are depressed too is because—
<b>DR:</b>	No desire and no energy.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I have no energy.  Um, just not there.  I mean my God, I wish I, I wish I could.  I wish I could run for a mile a day or something, but I just don't, and then, you know, you got all the other excuses.  My legs aren't too straight, you know, with the restless leg, it kind of affects your muscles a little bit.  So I don't exercise.  I mean I should, but I don't.
<b>DR:</b>	How about diet?  You mentioned losing weight.  Have you been watching your diet?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, no, not really.  Um, I try to watch my diet.  I'm one of these people that eats too much, and I know if I eat less and—
<b>DR:</b>	Or just what you eat.  If you eat more protein and less carbs, it'll help with your weight, and it'll also help with your mood.
<b>PT:</b>	Protein does?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  What happens when people get depressed, neurotransmitters fall.  Neurotransmitters are made from protein.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So if you eat more protein, you'll boost them.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And you mood will improve.  You should be eating more chicken, more fish.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And meat.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	That'll help.  Do you eat a lot of carbs, bread, potatoes, pastas?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, more than I should.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and that puts weight on and also worsens your mood.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Try that shift a little bit to eat more protein.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And maybe in the evening if you could take like a 15 minute, 20 minute walk, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It would, it would help.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	In terms of what medicine to start, I guess Prozac would make the most sense.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Because I remember you got a response many years ago.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it was very positive.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Extremely.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean unbelievable.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	What a difference it made.
<b>DR:</b>	Put you back on that.  The other thing though about the restless leg, I guess for now we can leave the Klonopin, but Requip is a, is a good drug for that without, you know, if it's more anxiety related, then the Klonopin's a good drug, but if it's a neurologic restless let, then Requip would do.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm not doctor, but I would say it's anxiety related.
<b>DR:</b>	Anxiety related?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, definitely, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well the best anxiety or stress reliever too is exercise, so.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Taking a little walk in the evening, what time do you get home in the evening?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, early, 5:30 or 6:00.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, go for a 15 minute, 20 minute walk.
<b>PT:</b>	Does Prozac make you gain weight?
<b>DR:</b>	That's a good question.  In the beginning, usually not.  Uh, Prozac, actually one of the metabolites, one of the main metabolites is an amphetamine like substance so it speeds you up so you shouldn't gain weight.  If you stay on 6 months to a year, sometimes people do gain weight.  I don't remember if you did or didn't in the past.  I don't—
<b>PT:</b>	I don't remember either.
<b>DR:</b>	But you should—
<b>PT:</b>	I just remember being on it trying to lose weight and then [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, in the beginning there shouldn't be any effect, but I think right now it makes sense to break the cycle, and it sounds like you've been on it and off it, you know, and you've been able to stay off it for years.  If we boost it and get you back feeling good with the Prozac, maybe we can get you off in 6 months.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	The other thing is if you start exercising and you eat more protein, you might normalize and stabilize the depression too.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Well I kind of have to get—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, yeah, no I definitely think you need an antidepressant to start.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I do too.
<b>DR:</b>	So I think, how about your concentration and focus, is that, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Problem for you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, sometimes, not, it depends on what the issue is and what the surroundings are.  I mean I think I can concentrate pretty good, but, you know, if there's 10 people around and I feel stressed, no I don't concentrate very good, but, you know.  I've also noticed that, you know, I kind of self diagnose myself.  I have a lot of, for a while, I was really stressed and I had more extra saliva.  Is that stress related do you think?
<b>DR:</b>	It could be, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And then my eyes would just tear.
<b>DR:</b>	Tear.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean not a tear, but they would tear up, they would water up.
<b>DR:</b>	Water up.  Well, I think you hold back a lot of sadness too.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean, you know, it's breaking through.  You said you cried once that you could remember.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But I don't know, with your burdens, the reality burdens you carry, I mean how could you not cry.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Have some relief.  I mean—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But at least you and [NAME OTHER] are doing better.  I mean it's more of a stable, I mean you're open with each other.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, there's more sharing.
<b>DR:</b>	Sharing.  She's not drinking either.
<b>PT:</b>	No.  I mean we look at each other and go drinking doesn't even help—
<b>DR:</b>	She said that, you mean?
<b>PT:</b>	As a joke.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Because what?
<b>PT:</b>	As a joke.  We both say it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, she works though.  What does she do when she works?
<b>PT:</b>	She works as a teacher's aide, so she helps, uh, autistic children—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh really.
<b>PT:</b>	That come into the school system, very difficult job.
<b>DR:</b>	I bet.  But you feel like you're a team working together?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah over the last year, it's, it's gotten better, and, uh, yeah I feel that way.  I mean I still think we have some issues with how much money is being spent, but, you know, I guess everybody has problems they need to work out.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, let me do this.  I'll put you back on Prozac and usually 20 mg.  I don't think you had side effects when you first took it.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So I think I could put you right back at the 20.  I don't think I have to start lower and gradually—
<b>PT:</b>	What side effects are you looking at?
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, people sometimes get a little activated when they first take it, and they can get a little, I mean if you want, I could start you at 10 and give you the tablets and break them in half for the first week or so to get used to it.  Um, but I'll try, I think 20 was what you were on.
<b>PT:</b>	I think 20 was what I was on.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't think I'll be agitated.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well do this, I'll give you the, I'll give you, what can I give you?  I'll give you the tablets of 20s.  If you take it and you get a little agitated, break them in half for a week just to get used to it.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	If not, just take the 20.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And then within 2 weeks, you should start feeling better just from the medication.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	When that kicks in, go ahead and start the extra walking activity.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	"And, uh, the protein in the diet you could start right away.	"
<b>PT:</b>	Protein and fruit or something.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Away from the carbs bread, potatoes and pasta.
<b>PT:</b>	Breads and pasta, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, stay away from that, and in terms of, uh, the Requip for the restless leg, I'll leave you on the Klonopin for now.  Just let me give you Prozac to see how you—
<b>PT:</b>	They won't hurt each other?
<b>DR:</b>	No, they won't hurt each other.  They'll work well together, but, uh, if, it's a low dose, but if the Prozac boosts you out of the depression, you know, and you're less anxious from that, then maybe we'll switch you down the road to the Requip.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You have insurance for medications, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  You know, I think I take the, um, restless leg, the, the Klonopin for more anxiety than the restless leg.
<b>DR:</b>	That's probably it, but Prozac can help with anxiety too.  When you feel less depressed, you just feel better overall.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But as soon as you're able, start walking just 15, 20 minutes.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, and say hi to [NAME OTHER] for me.
<b>PT:</b>	I will.  I tell her that every time.  She says you never said that.
<b>DR:</b>	I do say that.
<b>PT:</b>	I tell her.  Every time I see him, he says that.
