BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'd like to watch this session, have you watch this session and what I'm interested in is to get a sense of the relationship you have with Janice and what kind of-what the awareness is of what you're saying in terms of how she may be responding, reacting and what impact the relationship has on what's going on.
PATIENT: What's going on in the session, you mean the relationship particularly in this session? Or in general or do you mean this particular session?
COUNSELOR: Well you know the fact is that this session happened quite awhile ago so you might actually end up speaking more in generalities than-there might be times when I'm going to stop the tape and sort of say, "Do you remember what was going on for you, what you were thinking?" Because really what we're interested in is sort of the quality of the relationship you have with Janice and what you feel is going on between the two of you sometimes, is there a certain distance, a certain closeness at times, that kind of thing. 
PATIENT: Can I ask you a question about it?
COUNSELOR: Absolutely.
PATIENT: I'm assuming, when I spoke to Janice about-at the end, I was curious as to know what technique was used in terms of my therapy. I knew that there were various types that you would - forms you were using and she did say it was very much based on her and my relationship. In other words, how what was going on between she and I, related to what was going on outside. That's why she would always bring me back to, "Well how are you feeling about me now? Blah, blah, blah."
 So I'm assuming that's part of this right? [00:01:48 ]
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah that's very much, the model is very much that scenario, you use the relationship with the patient to sort of ground your understanding of what's going on, what might be going on with them and then to sort of serve as a laboratory for how they might be dealing with people outside.
So I'll just play a little in the beginning, just to sort of orient you to the session [indiscernible] [00:02:15 ]. You know again, there's some difficult parts.
PATIENT: [Laughs] I would have had my dinner. Actually it was better this way to have my dinner first, I'll have more stamina. In a word, I'm okay.
COUNSELOR: Yeah but you know it's all such moving and wonderful work and people [indiscernible] [00:02:33 ] achieving in here. So you should be proud of it.
PATIENT: Thanks.
COUNSELOR: [Indiscernible] [00:02:44 ] What was your understanding of that?
PATIENT: Well I said to-he's a nutritionist and I think am [indiscernible] [00:02:49 ] and he's seen my anger in terms and health problems that I've had he could - he's very smart and if I had a good medication or something like that. I had irritable bowels and he would tell me what was the best, what wasn't, and what to ask the doctor. If I had symptoms the same deal, he'd always tell me what - where to go, what to eat (inaudible).
And also I really attribute working with him more than anyone else. I have had irritable bowel for a long time. I mean it was a long, long time I had this thing and really [inaudible] [00:03:23 ] saying in terms of [inaudible] [00:03:25 ] vitamins and food and he's talking me through things psychologically. He [inaudible] [00:03:30 ] he's very bright. He knew what was going on, extremely perceptive and so what did you say was [inaudible] [00:03:44 ]?
COUNSELOR: Yeah what was it? Because my understanding is the.
PATIENT: Oh well what happened is [inaudible] [00:03:47 ] I talk a lot and get carried away, I get caught up in my own conversation and forget what the [inaudible] question was. [00:03:53 ].
COUNSELOR: So is that what you said? Because you were just sort of like-what was it that you asked?
PATIENT: I know and that's just me, it has nothing to do with Janice, it's just I do that a lot. So far I have been [inaudible] [00:04:09 ] and so I was actually thinking about being clinically depressed and maybe I should look-speak to you about having - getting medication you know. He knows about medications too and asking him because that's how we started and he takes this chart down and he says I got to tell you with this chart he said you're in very good shape physically too, so in other words-
COUNSELOR: A choice?
PATIENT: He's says what they call a [inaudible] [00:04:45 ] which has been controversial [inaudible] [00:04:46 ] and it tells you what your mineral balance is [inaudible] [00:04:53 ] and all of that kind of stuff and also were to find them in the [inaudible] [00:04:58]. But he's been working with me for so long that he can see-he can tell a lot from a chart, he can tell my thyroid is functioning [inaudible] [00:05:06 ] and he can tell when I've got low blood sugar. [Inaudible] [00:05:10 ] I mean not cancer or whatever but I mean stuff that's pretty-in other words physiologically or chemically or whatever you want to [inaudible] [00:05:22 ] pretty balanced.
COUNSELOR: So you were telling him about therapy and that you think you might need medication and he said [inaudible] [00:05:36 ]?
PATIENT: Well he said because of the way everything looked, he said ... I guess what says is that a lot of [inaudible] [00:05:45 ] health has been psychosomatic or psychological but he doesn't do psychological and I think that like irritable bowel it's known for [inaudible] [00:05:51 ] just like anything to do with the colon seems to be very much related to stress. There's a lot of things wrong. And how you deal with stress and [inaudible] [00:06:07 ].
COUNSELOR: Do you feel like you're having a hard time thinking what. I wanted to ask you about that.
PATIENT: I wanted to ask you about that. I think-I'm so much involved with holistic techniques and have been for so long and know that it isn't mainstream. I mean now it's a little bit more mainstream than it was but I've always been-I'm like my family considers me a health nut. I-when I was a flight attendant I was always kind of grappling with my health. I never really felt well from flying, it really did a number on my physically. So I wouldn't eat the airplane food I-now more people are like this. I wouldn't drink the water. They used to laugh at me-kid me, you know, because I would bring my own water and my own food on all the trips and stuff like that.
So that I think I was-I mean I didn't know for sure, but I had a feeling that perhaps Janice wouldn't go along with this whole thing with the hair analysis, would not think it was completely bonafide. My sense was that she was more mainstream than I was when it came to health issues.
So I think that I was-when I was explaining this to her I was-there was a part of me that was thinking she's not really buying this and it wasn't that she did anything or said anything for me to believe that. It was just my perception of knowing her as I did that she was probably more conservative with this stuff than I was. [00:07:34 ] Because that's generally the-that's generally the case.
COUNSELOR: Sure, and there was a certain discomfort on your part trying to sort of explain what this meant to you or your [inaudible] [00:07:46 ] with it and feeling like, "Well what's she thinking about this? She must think I'm crazy." Kind of stuff.
PATIENT: Right, right but it had nothing to do with anything that she had said in the past or any way that she acted, it was just that I'm used to this, you know what I mean?
COUNSELOR: And what is that? What happens then for you?
PATIENT: Well I get frustrated.
COUNSELOR: You get frustrated.
PATIENT: I get frustrated and it's a bit irritating to me because I believe in this stuff so much and people are so-quite often are so narrow minded or just don't have the knowledge. But their defenses are up about it because the medical establishment doesn't accept it and I can understand it because by the same token it's frustrating to me.
COUNSELOR: I would never have guessed that you were feeling frustrated then, it's funny.
PATIENT: I think that's what was going on, I mean I can't be sure but I think-that's why I was losing my train of thought. It was like I wanted to explain this and not thinking that-you know what I mean? And probably thinking, "I wonder how much of this she's believing."
COUNSELOR: Oh interesting, let's just watch a little bit more on this following tape. [00:09:02].
PATIENT: Okay.
[Watching videotape of previous therapy session]
PATIENT: You know why? Because I have - I just [inaudible] [00:09:07 ] defenses and [inaudible] [00:09:11 ] people when I talk about holistic things because I don't always think that people will believe it. And [inaudible] [00:09:21 ].
COUNSELOR: So you're not sure if I believe you?
PATIENT: Yeah and it's understandable to me, I don't say, "Oh everybody's crazy they don't-" I understand that there's some [inaudible] [00:09:34 ].
COUNSELOR: Well if I didn't believe it, what [inaudible] [00:09:38 ]?
PATIENT: Well in other words, an explanation of my conversation with him sounds a bit-I could see it sounding a bit sounding[inaudible] [00:09:47 ] what kind of credibility [inaudible] [00:09:52 ].
COUNSELOR: Yeah I could-yeah I mean I guess but I think what I was kind of questioning more was something about speaking to me do you really feel heard in a very deep sense and I just kind of-
PATIENT: Want to know whether I do feel-I feel very vulnerable.
COUNSELOR: No that wasn't where I was going but is that something that you think of in terms of-in terms of this? [Inaudible] [00:10:22 ]
PATIENT: Well if I think it was in terms of -
[Videotape stopped]
COUNSELOR: There was something I liked about the way you were so direct there and you laughed. What was going on for you?
PATIENT: You mean when I laughed at-
COUNSELOR: Just now, you just laughed and you said, "You mean whether I feel heard by you," or something. You just asked Janice it seems like a direct question.
PATIENT: Yeah, and I laughed right after? Well I don't know, I mean I don't know why I laughed, it's funny. Because I guess that's probably what was going through my mind, is she hearing me? Because it's not only do you believe holistic stuff but I'm so much a part of this and this is an issue for-whatever that are you hearing me? Do you whole heartedly understand? And I guess this guy Chris means a lot to me because he has always been there for me and he's always listened to me. So.
COUNSELOR: Is it now, would you be able to say that here it - you have the feeling of not being heard or you just were aware of being heard?
PATIENT: Not being-no I don't think I felt that I wasn't being heard. I guess it was-I was more concerned about the credibility about what I was talking about.
In other words, if somebody doesn't quite believe what you're saying, I think that gets in the way of their really hearing what you have to say. So if I was perceiving, which obviously I was, that she might not understand what I'm talking about here or that it felt credible, I'm not being whole heartedly heard right?
COUNSELOR: Did you have the - a sense of hearing her at this time, do you remember?
PATIENT: What she said to me?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah, [inaudible] [00:12:14 ] but when she said that I [inaudible] [00:12:16 ].
[Watching videotape of pervious therapy session]
PATIENT: [inaudible] [00:12:23 ] sometimes you're not going to have to [inaudible] [00:12:35] so in other words here's this [inaudible] [00:12:52 ] Right and maybe he doesn't know you as well as you do in certain areas too. And maybe he doesn't know the depth of the thing [inaudible] [00:13:03 ] gotten very emotional [inaudible] [00:13:06] I don't know. What do you suppose you.
[Videotape stopped]
COUNSELOR: I wanted to stop again, I think this is interesting in that it seems a bit like maybe, you know, you were saying you felt a little frustrated but it's hard to hear your frustration. In a way I feel, when I was watching this I thought you were in a way, letting Janice off the hook by saying, "Oh but it's the nature of the short term treatment as opposed to [inaudible] [00:13:41 ]." It might be something with her or-did you feel that? Were you tempering what you were saying at all? Do you have that sense then?
PATIENT: I think I might have been a little bit concerned about not hurting her but I didn't think that-I didn't feel like, "Oh this is a woman who doesn't understand me or-" there wasn't that sense.
COUNSELOR: Right, so there wasn't really that strong sort of frustration.
PATIENT: I mean there is a general sense with me that I can't be misunderstood and I sometimes-and this may be ego or whatever you call it, but sometimes the pain is so great that somebody [inaudible][00:14:28 ] saying I mean I'm not walking around with pain all the time. But yet when I'm in, in other words it's such a-
COUNSELOR: Certain parts of [inaudible] [00:14:37 ].
PATIENT: Yeah you know that if I let that all hang out, that's what was so valuable about these sessions, that I was able to let it all hang out probably more than I've ever done and I didn't die and Janice didn't walk out of the room, you know what I mean? Because I think with you, as you know, we think-when something's held in so long, we think it's going to destroy us if it's [inaudible] [00:15:03 ] idea you know and it [inaudible] [00:15:04 ]. I mean it's almost as if therapy is valuable for that alone. I mean not to mention [inaudible] [00:15:10 ], but just that.
And I would say the biggest thing that I got out of this was that. I wrestled the demons, that I saw them. I mean I-one of the things I was trying to describe to a friend, learning about how valuable it was, is I remember specifically and probably these sort of sessions, I had to do a reflexology workshop that night and I never scheduled-this session here was something that I do in front of a group because I didn't want to have to get myself all together after.
I went home, got myself together went down to [inaudible] [00:15:47 ] had dinner and I gave a workshop that was great. Three hours later, I was like in the depths. So that says so much to me and it was different than it's before. I wasn't quite as on, it was real, it was realer, so that's what it was about. I mean it's a lot of things but that's finding out that I [inaudible] [00:16:13 ].
COUNSELOR: And there's something about Janice sort of staying with you and kind of tolerating part of those feelings that you brought in that really felt healing to you.
PATIENT: And I have to tell you, and I probably said this in the sessions, the thing that amazed me about the whole process was that Janice didn't seem to say much or-I mean what she said obviously triggered off a lot of stuff in me. I mean it was incredible to me that what seemingly seemed like not a lot going on, it wasn't dialogue going on with Janice, really allowed me to get in touch with a lot of stuff. It was an amazing process to me. How much of this was timing and that I - was this a time in my life where I was ready to do this and how much of it was the process, how much of it was Janice, I don't know. But it certainly seemed to work.
I mean I can't say that I-I could have expected any more than I got out it quite frankly, I'm not disappointed.
COUNSELOR: Well you know there's a difference in you I have to say. I see a real difference, I see a real calm in you or-
PATIENT: Not all the time [inaudible] [00:17:29 ].
COUNSELOR: No I know, no I see [inaudible] [00:17:32 ].
PATIENT: But I feel I-well the family issues, I feel much, much better, I mean I feel that was just horrendous. And you - I don't know whether you remember my sessions back when I had an apartment now that I'm putting together which is-I mean I lived in this place where nobody came up to it, I was [inaudible] [00:17:49 ] I had this little apartment and I'm having it painted and renovated and [inaudible][00:17:55 ]. That's a big [inaudible] [00:17:57 ] for me.
COUNSELOR: Oh really? How nice. Congratulations.[00:17:59 ].
PATIENT: [Inaudible] [00:18:01 ] silly after all of these years. But that's funny. 
COUNSELOR: Good for you.
PATIENT: Yeah well, you know it's with all you guys, your help. Did you look at all of the sessions?
COUNSELOR: You know I didn't, I looked more at earlier sessions and then I looked at the [inaudible] [00:18:17 ] this session and the prior session. So I'm maybe more updated on that towards the end.
PATIENT: I see, okay. But I mean with this process, would it be usual-were you the only one who was observing the sessions?
COUNSELOR: I might have been the only one sort of taking a particular interest in the sessions. A lot of times they're shown in supervision but since Janice is an experienced [inaudible] [00:18:39 ] therapist, a lot of times that-she didn't need to go through that process. But you know occasionally if there was some issue or problem she felt was coming up between the two of you, she'd share that.
PATIENT: I see, interesting, okay.
COUNSELOR: Okay. I'm going to forward that a little bit.
[Watching videotape of previous therapy session]
PATIENT: [Inaudible] [00:19:05 ] sure that I am. yeah you've got to remember that I am a bit of a ham. I don't mean that I was doing anything phony and I don't mind the attention put on me.
COUNSELOR: By - ?
PATIENT: Well I mean like even this is not- this is not just obviously not uncomfortable but that seems like I was saying to myself, we'll be talking about my therapy [inaudible] [00:19:26 ] me.
COUNSELOR: Well I don't know if [inaudible] [00:19:28 ] I'm the same way. I don't mind if someone videotaped my therapy and like just wanted to talk about it.
PATIENT: It's because I'll get to an acting career or performing or whatever.
COUNSELOR: It's wonderful to have all that attention though and interest, you know.
PATIENT: Yeah I mean and that's why to me having-not only being in the therapy session, but also having the value of your opinion and other people. That doesn't happen when you're in a private session with a therapist who works on their own. I mean that to me is valuable.
COUNSELOR: Well good. Not everyone feels that way.
PATIENT: I know. My girlfriend started, my friend has started a program.
COUNSELOR: Here?
PATIENT: Yeah, Betty [inaudible] [00:20:07 ].
COUNSELOR: Before [inaudible] [00:20:09 ]?
PATIENT: Yeah she just started.
COUNSELOR: That sounds familiar. Betty [Inaudible] [00:20:13 ].
PATIENT: [Inaudible] [00:20:16 ] that's funny. She's my best friend.
COUNSELOR: Oh really? Oh [inaudible] [00:20:21 ].
PATIENT: [Inaudible] [00:20:32 ].
COUNSELOR: What kind of name is [inaudible] [00:20:33 ]?
PATIENT: Croatian, Russian and Polish.
COUNSELOR: I just have to sit and listen and catch up.
[Videotape turned on]
PATIENT: Now [Inaudible] [00:20:56 ]I mean I come in and it might be significant, because I walked through this door again thinking I felt good and now I don't feel so good. I feel clear but I mean I don't feel as optimistic or as really [inaudible] [00:21:08 ].
[Videotape stopped]
COUNSELOR: I just-I wanted to make that - just another comment. It seemed to me in the later sessions that I watched, that you have-just starting to sort of catch yourself and the way you sort of would stay in the moment, I think I was feeling a little defensive with you or, I'm aware of not feeling so good now and then I was feeling good before. I mean I was wondering if that was sort of a part of because that's sort of the model of therapy here to just slow things down until you get that you're pretty well aware of you r feelings. And it seems like that's something that you've started to do.
PATIENT: Oh without a doubt. Without a doubt and I attribute that to a process and from Janice stopping me and I became very aware of how I would talk fast and go on and on and on and get it right from the feeling I always associated with it. So I just hope that I can keep carrying that on in my personal life. You know I need to be here and [inaudible] [00:22:10 ].
[Videotape turned on]
PATIENT: But yeah I think-I mean I know one thing that helped tremendously with my feelings of depression and that was exercise. I have got to I feel [at least 45 minutes of exercise in the morning. I'm much better. I don't mean it's the answer but it does help. There's something about my systems being down physically too that seems to contribute to depression. But I need to-I need to get my energy up, I'm just, it's like a complete thing. It's something good it's like it might [inaudible] [00:22:57] if I get my [inaudible] [00:23:00 ] I did not go to sleep much and I could if I looked after it. I'm beginning to realize now a lot of my [inaudible] [00:23:09 ].
COUNSELOR: Can we go back a minute to what you were saying about the concern that comes up for you when you think you feel okay and then you come in here and [inaudible] [00:23:21 ].
PATIENT: Well it's not like I'm thinking, "Oh my God, I'm going to see Janice I've got to - Janice and I'm going to fall apart again." I'm just aware of it almost like, you know, that I'm still-there's so much stuff going on underneath the surface.
COUNSELOR: And you think that there shouldn't be or you don't want there to be or what?
PATIENT: I don't want those things certainly - well I don't whether the word would be should but it's astounding to me that this sounds bad. I [Inaudible] [00:24:06] and I kept thinking do other people have this? Do other people walk around with this?
[Videotape stopped]
PATIENT: It amazed me that there was so much stuff going on beneath the surface that I wasn't in touch with.
COUNSELOR: So as you're watching it now you're just-
PATIENT: Yeah I mean it's just amazing to me.
[Videotape started]
PATIENT: [Inaudible] [00:24:33 ] about what it means [inaudible] [00:24:53 ] because there's [inaudible] [00:24:54 ] and [inaudible] [00:25:04 ] to [00:25:12 ]. Now as I'm sitting here I'm thinking [inaudible] [00:25:19 ]
COUNSELOR: So I think there's a lot going on for you right now about what it means that this is - that there's seven sessions left and that you have become aware of [inaudible] [00:24:59] vulnerable feelings and at this point that doesn't seem to be a - those feelings aren't diminished. If anything they feel stronger to you and.
PATIENT: Yeah and I've been thinking - I'm thinking I'm not getting and I think maybe it's anger but I'm not getting [inaudible] [00:25:21] myself. I think that's a lot of it. I mean I feel like I'm [inaudible] [00:25:28]. And I don't mean it as I feel so angry but it's like a - it's like you know somebody had - your primal therapy. It's like I want to just get out.
COUNSELOR: What would you see?
PATIENT: I don't know. It's like I get so God damn frustrated. You know it's like God why don't I fucking change? I just feel [inaudible] [00:25:49] and just kind of - [inaudible] [ 00:25:51] getting up and doing my exercises and coming home and going to work and coming home and looking at TV and fighting sleep and it's like God. It's like almost madness. Like I'm hanging on, you know like I'm just able to get through the day and nobody you know if I play it right nobody will really know that I don't know. 
COUNSELOR: [Inaudible] [00:26:18]
PATIENT: [Inaudible] [00:26:22] I want something to happen. Take me like - if I would have fantasized maybe I love the, alright we'll get it, take the [inaudible] [00:26:32] out now. Like they'll shake you up and you know? And then you all of the sudden forget whatever that is. Time out. [Inaudible] [00:26:52] And I believe it's all crap. [Inaudible] [00:26:57] something else and I'm not looking for new and perfect. I don't mean it in that way. That I can't. I don't want to be the center of attention. I just want to be whole and petite and in touch with what's going on. I mean a real sense of what I'm doing and moving ahead in a direction that makes sense and. And I can see all of the pieces and I can see the things that I could do for my business. I can see [inaudible] [ 00:27:24] pleadingly what I need to do to make myself feel better. Health wise I can see it but I do not feel it. I do not feel it. I choose to be frozen. 
[Videotape stopped]
COUNSELOR: That was a real display of something to determine nature - the frustration.
PATIENT: Well the determination in that for sure because it's funny because I mean I - that sense of being frozen. I know it's not going to [inaudible] [00:27:58] to say it because I'm you know may be - I may jinx it but I don't feel quite as frozen. I think this was - the step with the apartment was huge for me. That in itself shook me completely up. And I had people coming and giving me ideas. You know nobody was in the apartment for so long. And you know I would have people up occasionally but really no big deal. And with that kind of - kind of stirs the pot.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So when I said frozen I would sit in the apartment in the chair frozen.
COUNSELOR: But you're not frozen here.
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: You know and that's the most - I mean I haven't been - I haven't seen a lot of the sessions but that's the most [inaudible] [00:28:40] really I've seen you in terms of physically moving and your voice is loud and ...
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: There's just a lot being expressed in that.
PATIENT: Right. The frustration I was feeling.
COUNSELOR: That's the frustration?
PATIENT: I was feeling frustrated. 
COUNSELOR: And the frustration was with?
PATIENT: The molade (ph) (sp?) and I was have a frustration about that because I still have a molade (ph) (sp?). And I still - it's not - I mean it's not that far removed because I still - I know the things I can do to get this - the business back on track and slow down and get things like that. 
And part of it may be that I've been such a workaholic that when I slow down I could see that if it was [inaudible] [00:29:24]. Right now I don't want to be too busy so [inaudible] [00:29:27] setting up my home. I'm trying to make my home in my apartment. It scares me a little because I've been so controlling [in the past] (ph) you know moving ahead and making sure that everything was right and that the business was operating correctly. 
And I'm just - I'm consciously stepping back now. Before I was just frozen. It wasn't like I was deliberately stepping back because I wanted to. I did it because [inaudible] [ 00:29:50].
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So.
COUNSELOR: I was wondering a little bit about your [inaudible] [00:29:57] to check me at this point. It was just - is it that you're more sort of involved in some - in working through this frustration and getting out of it in the moment? You're moving it - moving it and expressing it or.
PATIENT: Well I mean I wasn't - I quite frankly wasn't thinking of Janice. It was more I was thinking of myself. I mean I think it's just a matter of ... how am I going to get this out? [00:30:21]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I still feel that way in a way. It's like I just want to (makes noise) just you know get passed this and move on.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
[Videotape started]
PATIENT: [Inaudible] [00:30:33] I'm afraid to move [inaudible] [00:30:40]. And as much as I think this is [inaudible] [00:30:45] to do. I'm really pissed (ph).
COUNSELOR: You shouldn't.
[Videotape stopped]
PATIENT: I know. Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: The shift between would be so.
PATIENT: I know.
COUNSELOR: Animated to the point of.
PATIENT: Yes. I know.
[Videotape started]
COUNSELOR: You're being really independent.
PATIENT: But there's a part of me that's - I feel like I'm beating it up ... a part of me. I ... I feel like I'm [inaudible] [00:31:28] for ... [inaudible] [00:31:32]. 
[Videotape stopped]
COUNSELOR: You said here if I'm critical first maybe you won't be critical of me. So I'm wondering if there is maybe at the same time that there's - I just wondering about that. That there might be some way that like Janice watches or [inaudible] [00:31:57]
PATIENT: Well yeah and I think probably what it - if I - if I'm correct probably what was going through my mind was projecting my mother and father - one or the other onto Janice. Because they would consider what I'm going through - I mean when I think that now it may not be that I was thinking that at the time. I think they were considering what I was doing in therapy self indulging.
So the [inaudible] [00:32:24] they talk about was that. So the way of getting around that would be if I'm critical of myself being like this. If I wasn't beating myself up then I can do this. 
COUNSELOR: And so you're awareness with Janice was sort of like that critical part.
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And watching this thinking.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know what's she going on about it or what - what is the [inaudible] [00:32:47] or whatever. (laughs)
PATIENT: Right. We'll just go on with our lives. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Got it.
[Videotape started]
PATIENT: I can tell you how much I want to change me but [inaudible] [00:33:01] I don't want [inaudible] [00:33:02] 
COUNSELOR: [Inaudible] [00:33:06] You - you're.
PATIENT: If I don't like sharing [inaudible] [00:33:09] But sometimes it's a little bit - it should be [inaudible] [00:33:17]
COUNSELOR: You're aware of feeling -concerned about my criticism - about that.
PATIENT: Well I feel - I do feel more [inaudible] [00:33:35]
COUNSELOR: I just want to be clear to it.
PATIENT: Yeah. As much [Inaudible] [00:33:55] But I don't want [inaudible] [00:34:08]
COUNSELOR: Oh. So does [inaudible] [00:34:32] having said - acknowledged that?
[Videotape stopped]
COUNSELOR: You're said something about.
PATIENT: That there I.
COUNSELOR: No. Did you want me to?
PATIENT: No. That's alright.
COUNSELOR: Just that it's a real - that it seemed to me that there was just so much exposure. Know what I'm saying?
PATIENT: Yeah because I don't face up to that. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know what I mean? It's like ... in playing it as I was sitting here listening to it ... I just don't think about it that much. Do you know what I mean? It's like part of the reason I don't like - I'm - one of things - I mean there's a couple of things I - about liking this therapy is oh that I hate the trip down here and the time and all of the - but I can get [inaudible] [00:35:39] too to face up to me for the vulnerability [inaudible] [00:35:46]. And I'm constantly thinking in terms I make myself strong and then I think how can I [inaudible] [00:35:52]
But I can remember thinking that was a big - that revelation to me when I was sitting here. You know what I mean? I was.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It just came. So yeah.
[Videotape started]
PATIENT: I seem to always [inaudible] [00:36:40]. It's pretty dark. (sighs)
COUNSELOR: So you're saying you're [inaudible] [00:37:26] You think that combination like no one knows. That feeling when [inaudible] [00:37:46] you feel the pressure and you can feel.
PATIENT: Can feel what?
COUNSELOR: The frustration that you that you do often [inaudible] [00:37:56].
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: So whenever you say yeah that's me - if [inaudible] [00:38:06] at a different level.
PATIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: [Inaudible] [00:38:15] happen right there.
PATIENT: Yeah maybe not being [inaudible] [00:38:24].
COUNSELOR: And trying - just doing there.
PATIENT: [Inaudible] [00:38:33] with me and I (coughs) 
[Videotape stopped] 
COUNSELOR: See even like this [Inaudible] [00:38:49] 
PATIENT: There was an unknown part in that because I don't [inaudible] [00:39:01] getting close enough to allow him to know how much [inaudible] [00:39:07] So when I told him that I [inaudible] [00:39:14]
COUNSELOR: [Inaudible] [00:39:21] you're talking [inaudible] [00:39:23]
PATIENT: Yeah. I [inaudible] [00:39:25] in generally [inaudible] [00:39:27] say anything like [inaudible] [00:39:28]. I was feeling very much alone. I feel -I feel [inaudible] [00:39:41]. 
COUNSELOR: So you kind of already pulling away?
PATIENT: Well when I was experiencing the feelings of being and I'm - I was trying to impress [inaudible] [00:39:55] I guess. You know what I mean? It wouldn't be [inaudible] [00:39:57] I don't think. I mean I don't know whether it would help me but it was like being a [inaudible] [00:40:01] in me. But I can't say it.
Yeah but you see this - that's just what I was going to say because that's not true because I wouldn't have done that on my own. 
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: I mean I would not have gotten [inaudible] [00:40:15] of those feelings by myself.
COUNSELOR: And that's kind of what you do say right now. How can I say that? But I'm wondering if that wasn't though you're experience and there's a certain honesty that you - that you're just coming up with that saying I did feel alone [inaudible] [00:40:32] And then I was.
PATIENT: You mean which is right? Which [inaudible] [00:40:36] you were going to say?
COUNSELOR: I don't - I wanted to ask you what it felt like because it - I just I did feel alone. I didn't feel like you were there ... which is essentially what you said here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And then if someone's being honest and maybe I was thinking that that was difficult for you to say [inaudible] [00:40:52].
PATIENT: It probably was. I mean I don't remember exactly but ... I mean it kind of just goes with the territory. If I - I mean I feel alone in my neediness if that makes sense.
COUNSELOR: Yeah it would.
PATIENT: In other words I don't allow myself to be - you know what I mean. I haven't been involved with a man in so long. I hadn't - I had friends but ... if I enlarge (ph) and allow my neediness to show on number one and number two I don't try to fill the vacuum at that particular - I don't know mean I'm trying to say. I feel alone in my neediness is what I'm trying to say.
COUNSELOR: You feel alone in your neediness and you said that. In some sense you said I felt alone just now. I believe - I think you need - you were having to or whatever which I imagine would be a difficult thing to say. 
PATIENT: But you know what part of what I was getting at too is that one of the reasons why I felt so alone is because I was going back it seemed to me about how I felt when I was a child. This is what I was relating to that I mean I felt there must have been some need that wasn't fulfilled with my parents. And that - because when I said it feels so dark and so old I was experiencing this feeling from a long time ago. [00:42:14]
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.
PATIENT: So it - so I was so rapped up in my own [inaudible] [00:42:18] that Janice wasn't even a part of - you know what I mean?
COUNSELOR: I do.
PATIENT: It was like I wanted to get in touch with it. It wasn't like I wanted - oh Janice now help me.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: It was like I wanted to feel it.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: At that particular moment. 
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: Because it's a feeling that I don't allow myself to have much or if I had it I don't feel that deep.
COUNSELOR: Right. Okay. Well let's just - some [inaudible] [00:42:42] that was interesting just from an exchange.
[Videotape started]
COUNSELOR: So you kind of thought that you had pulled away from.
PATIENT: Well when I was experiencing the feelings of ... neediness I was trying to get in touch with it I guess. You know what I mean? It wouldn't be appropriate I don't think - I mean [inaudible] [00:43:05] appropriate but it was my [inaudible] [00:43:07] in you and needing it. But I can't say it because you were there for me. You were listening to me. I wouldn't be doing this on my own [inaudible] [00:43:17]. 
[Videotape stopped]
COUNSELOR: Okay. I was wondering what went on.
PATIENT: [Inaudible] [00:43:20] like that's true.
COUNSELOR: I guess I was wondering if you had any sense of ... of ... it seemed to me a bit like you were qualifying it - like it - don't see the person. I wouldn't have done this unless.
PATIENT: I was [inaudible] [00:43:42]
COUNSELOR: You know like don't get hurt here. 
PATIENT: That response. Yeah
COUNSELOR: Like that was old and dark and that wasn't.
PATIENT: Yeah. I was [inaudible] [00:43:49]
COUNSELOR: So that there was again the concern with the - with Janice.
PATIENT: Right. Right.
COUNSELOR: Feeling.
PATIENT: I mean I'm not sure but at the same token I can't say that she was - whatever she did ... I mean I got so much out of it. Do you know what I mean? It's like.
COUNSELOR: Oh I know.
PATIENT: You know what I mean? And Janice was there for me and she facilitated a lot of what took place and I mean - do you know what I'm saying?
COUNSELOR: Yeah I do. I do know.
PATIENT: I mean I do - I remember there was one time where I really kind of wanted this [inaudible] [00:44:23] but it wasn't a - she was my therapist. She was the best. You know it's just not a ... a friend in that sense. You know what I mean? Where touchy, feely group sessions? I mean do you know what I'm saying about? Her role was appropriate for [inaudible] [00:44:39].
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. I guess I'm kind of going after sort of maybe the more problematic aspect. And you're sensing that and saying well but let's put it in the context of my being very much help if I.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: With the therapy. And I realize.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: I do realize.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Just tell me to back off if it gets [inaudible] [00:45:05]
PATIENT: That's alright. Maybe not or again it's like [inaudible] [00:45:12] it's like I haven't realized how much you could do to facilitate. [Inaudible] [00:45:19] you being here has been this to me and maybe I don't want to own up to the real importance. Do you know what I mean? It goes back to my meaning for you. 
And it goes back to what you were saying early about this perception that you were depending on it. You [inaudible] [00:45:43]. Well what does that really mean to [inaudible] [00:45:47] you know you kind of have struggled with being dependent on other people. 
COUNSELOR: What did it feel like to say that to Janice or like to like to own up to my - do you.
PATIENT: Well you know what's funny because sometimes words were coming out that would surprise me because those feelings would always be held back so much that I would think - I mean I can kind of imagine myself saying yeah that's right as I'm saying it. And really there was no forethought given to it. It was just ... I mean I just don't like depending on people. [Inaudible] [00:46:35] I need them more. You know I just don't.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it kind of takes me back when I think gee you know I really need this person or I can depend on this person. It's like - I don't know. I mean I depend on people to a degree - I - it's not like I'm totally isolated. I do depend on people but I think I'm really emotionally I don't depend. I don't even think [inaudible] [00:47:03] question. How much are we supposed to depend on someone emotionally? I don't know. I don't even know what the answer to that is. (laughs)
COUNSELOR: I'm big on depending [inaudible] [00:47:15]. (laughs)
PATIENT: You're big on dependent stuff?
COUNSELOR: Apparently. But it's.
PATIENT: [Inaudible] [00:47:23] to me. I mean depending on someone.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.
PATIENT: You mean emotionally?
COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. I think it's essential.
PATIENT: Well I hope I can have a relationship like that because I certainly - I mean I have friends. [Inaudible] [00:47:42] don't have a man in my life where I'm depending upon him emotionally. That's the one thing that I said to Janice. It's a shame that I couldn't have been involved with somebody during this [inaudible] [00:47:52] because it would have been helpful. 
In many respects it was good because I was able to focus on myself with no distractions but on the same token a lot of things with issues that have come up - but that's the only - that's why sometimes when I'd like to do it again and probably when I am involved with somebody. I mean it would be a good time to just kind of check in to see what's going on.
COUNSELOR: It - but here it's like you're saying you know God I'm really dependent on you. But is there a sense of feeling that along with the words for you?
PATIENT: Feeling it - what I guess the feeling that I had was ... a surprise as I said and ... like it was an alien feeling. 
COUNSELOR: Let's just watch a little bit more of this.
[Videotape started]
PATIENT: I mean I wonder how much this [inaudible] [00:48:52] of people. This bad feeling - I'm really ... it's created a distance that I don't want. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's the sad thing about this emptiness. You [inaudible] [00:49:14] thinking that you're protecting yourself. But the reality is you're using [inaudible] [00:49:19] you don't want.
 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: That's why it's so important to understand this. I mean trying to [inaudible] [00:49:25]
PATIENT: I remember that because that's an important thing to remember. 
COUNSELOR: Well I get the sense you [inaudible] [00:49:31] this [inaudible] [00:49:34] pressure and you feel a pressure and it holds you from having a memory - to hang onto the things that [inaudible] [00:49:39] you're going to be.
PATIENT: Well I have a [inaudible] [00:49:43] because that shouldn't happen to me. And if it's [inaudible] [00:49:46] and there's no grounding. I'm - I feel [inaudible] [00:49:52] because I'm [inaudible] [00:49:56] the child. And I get a [inaudible] [00:50:03] feeling that [inaudible] [00:50:05]. That must be kind of [inaudible] [00:50:17].
COUNSELOR: What do you mean kind of relation?
PATIENT: I mean I get the feeling that you're [inaudible] [00:50:23]. He's a young guy and [inaudible] [00:50:32] the man that I want to spend the rest of my life with at all or think that - the young guy I want to have a kind of relationship with him. I think that could be [inaudible] [00:50:43]. 
Because if that like I [inaudible] [00:50:50] felt like maybe you know. Well what maybe I know who I loved. Yeah. I am wondering if he [inaudible] [00:50:59] or not that this is [inaudible] [00:51:00] but I think it's very hard for me right now.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. To like in the moment in terms of how painful it is to ... and also to kind of power this inside about how you might [inaudible] [00:51:15] from other in a state of having to confront your needs. I mean I think it's fine that I'm.
[Videotape stopped]
PATIENT: I told you what my mother does.
COUNSELOR: What's that? Your mother.
PATIENT: She doesn't accept people.
COUNSELOR: How is it and what did it feel like to come out? What happened when you said - I get the feeling something [inaudible] [00:51:37] for you.
PATIENT: Well you see I.
COUNSELOR: Were you - do you remember that?
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I said that because I could see the look in her eye. And then she explained what was going on which it was absolutely true. It was that I was getting away from what was really going on.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Do you remember though what the feeling was when you saw the look in her eye?
PATIENT: There had to have been some annoyance. But a part of me was knowing that I was manipulating this - that I was moving on to something else.
COUNSELOR: So you wanted to get caught up in it? You wanted her to kind of?
PATIENT: I guess.
COUNSELOR: [Inaudible] [ 00:52:17] you wanted to tell her.
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean there was some frustration - in other words it wasn't honest. What I was doing was done for the wrong - talking about him I think although it was something I did want to talk to him at another point. But that particular moment was ... a way of getting around it. [Inaudible] [00:52:31]. 
{Videotape started]
PATIENT: No but it is right. I don't think you understand I was getting away.
COUNSELOR: Let me say something that I really want to underscore because when you say I'm going to [inaudible] [00:52:47] through fingers part of what I feel is that ... you have increasing been able to drop yourself by identifying and moving away from things - recognizing feelings distant or you recognize that you want to [inaudible] [00:53:05] I mean and that's not the only way you do it. [Inaudible] [00:53:10] 
That kind of [inaudible] [00:53:15] that I'm not sure you could give yourself as much credit for and if you could I mean to a point. I'm not stopping you any time. You - I mean you stop and you said I have the feeling you're not interested in this but that came from you. That came from your awareness that something should be there. 
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Also [inaudible] [00:53:42] I don't mean to [inaudible] [00:53:48] you don't have any faith [inaudible] [00:53:51] but I think you know [inaudible] [00:53:54] but.
[Videotape stopped] 
COUNSELOR: Do you remember a little bit about that? That moment where said again you just wanted to sort of well you know that's [inaudible] [00:54:07] too kind of thing. 
PATIENT: I mean how I felt? I don't know. I don't know. I mean I really can't per se what was going on or anything.
COUNSELOR: How about when you watch it now? What you do think about?
PATIENT: Well I was thinking it was honest of me to say that to her kind of you know that I can pick up something in her eyes. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean when you get to know somebody you always can just see some little thing you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.
PATIENT: It doesn't take much.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: I mean that is something I wouldn't have picked up the first two sessions or the first five sessions or whatever.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: But you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. [inaudible] [00:54:41] feeling good. Yeah.
PATIENT: And also it's like a closeness and I mean ... too would like people to be able to pick that kind of stuff up in me and have a relationship with somebody kind of be able to sense something more. Yeah. (laughs)
COUNSELOR: Good.
[Videotape started]
COUNSELOR: So you're saying you followed my queue?
PATIENT: No. I mean ... see what I think what it is when I'm not ... I don't remember if I do but when I'm ... wow I think if I'm moving away from the issue ... there's part of me that's aware of it and if I look at you sometimes maybe I can get a sense that yes you do know where I'm going.
COUNSELOR: [Inaudible] [00:55:39]
PATIENT: You know I have to say that [inaudible] [00:55:43] but the therapist that I was with years ago - there was a lot more talking and what's amazing is and it's - I'm sure it's something [inaudible] [00:55:55] but it's amazing how with so few words from you ... that comes up on [inaudible] [00:56:03]. I mean [inaudible] [00:56:06] in anything. 
COUNSELOR: But that's because it's really about you and it's about understanding you - not only for you but for our relationship. It's not about me.
PATIENT: I know. And that's the way it should be. But I mean that's why I can really see the value of you're not doing a lot of talking. And that's a good therapy to talk [inaudible] [00:56:37]. You know I was just saying?
COUNSELOR: I think I wonder if there's a really - okay here I go, we'll go through the trouble again. And then put the - a bit of - a little piece of satisfaction I think ... with the fact that's happening so far - I mean in that.
PATIENT: Oh. 
COUNSELOR: That you use the word - it's just amazing to me in that sort of ... like I'm just wondering if that was sort of covering up.
PATIENT: Oh. Because see ... no it's not just satisfaction - oh how do I say this? It's hard to get in touch with yourself - in touch with the reality that's going fine - in touch with these feelings.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If that can be defused it's more comfortable. If somebody's talking and getting you away from it, it's more comfortable. Do I want to get in touch with the pain? No. It's forcing me to do that. So oh course yeah I would much rather sit there and chat with Janice. (laughs) Do you know what I'm saying? It would be nice to have - for me to hear about her and share and do you know what I mean?
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: That would be more comfortable.
COUNSELOR: Right. Right.
PATIENT: But this worked.
COUNSELOR: Right. Yes.
PATIENT: Given the choice between the therapy that I had before and this therapy I would pick this. I mean this feels much more constructive. So my dissatisfaction would be in that [inaudible] [00:58:06] satisfaction or that - it wasn't easy for - do you know what I'm saying? It wasn't - I wasn't always pleasant.
COUNSELOR: Right. So when you made this comment it was just sort of - just some sort of - just speak generally about your?
PATIENT: Yeah. I'm somebody who talks like kind of like I want to run on and on and on. I guess the other thing is I'm always intimidated by somebody who doesn't talk as much. You know the strong silent type sort of person? You know and I'm blah, blah, blah and I'm going I talk too much a lot of times. I wish I didn't have to do that compulsion or whatever you call it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. I mean I was just wondering if there wasn't some - some of that in that comment that it could be uncomfortable. It might not be dissatisfaction for it to be.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It might be uncomfortable to.
PATIENT: Right. That's what I was saying - not dissatisfaction.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: There's a big difference.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It is.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: There's a big difference. But again sort of [inaudible] [00:59:13] in terms now I'm just constructing this myself so there's no way to tell - [inaudible] [00:59:18] in terms it won't be hurtful to Janice. 
PATIENT: Yeah I guess. I think there was always a concern that not wanting to have it be taken the wrong way or that's probably right.
COUNSELOR: That's kind of always in the back down there that not.
PATIENT: Maybe.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Tell me if this is - does not feel right. I mean.
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean it isn't like I'm always being oh I mean ... if I'm being protective of her it's not because something happened and I don't want you to know about or that I was dissatisfied. It's that I don't want it to be misinterpreted. Do you know what I mean? 
It's not like I'm talking about a friend. I'm talking about a professional and the technique that's being used. Do you know what I'm saying? It's not like I'm saying - and like I said it's two different things. Janice is the way she was because of the process. Janice acted in a way that was appropriate for the whole process. If it made me uncomfortable so be it. I mean that's - it worked.
COUNSELOR: Right. Right.
PATIENT: So that's all I'm saying. And that's why if I caught her up I think it was because I was aware of that was is a part [inaudible] [00:60:35] that.
COUNSELOR: That she wanted to understand. And you wanted her to understand that you knew that this.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: That this relationship [inaudible] [00:60:43].
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: And that it was a therapeutic matter.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
[Videotape started]
PATIENT: A couple of times [inaudible] [00:60:53] but a couple of times I said okay ... I'm feeling lonely. I'm feeling scared. And I'm feeling very [inaudible] [00:61:09]. I think it might of - I end up having the time I think. I don't know if I'm [inaudible] [00:61:15] and I said ... something to the effect of okay this will pass. [Inaudible] [00:61:22] today. Tomorrow is a new day. And I did it but most of the time I'm still running around [inaudible] [00:61:29]. I mean it's like [inaudible] [00:61:33]. I mean that and [inaudible] [00:61:39].
COUNSELOR: What do you think would be the difference that meant if you were able to do that? I mean just kind of assertive yourself and be with [inaudible] [00:61:49] people.
PATIENT: Oh I'm not - well at that particular moment I wasn't running away. I had something to think about. I was trying to say.
COUNSELOR: And [inaudible] [00:61:58] tune in. 
PATIENT: I mean like for example this week - for the weekend like when I [inaudible] [00:62:04] because that's what I do when I get lonely. So I don't have - I can always give things to friends but I always think alright now what can I do ... because I can give the stuff to my girlfriend, [inaudible] [00:62:15] blah, blah, blah. 
And can I [inaudible] [00:62:21] because I got to move in and I can react to [inaudible] [00:62:26] I mean the only way to get through this loneliness is not to be with other people, it's to be with me. I am convinced that [inaudible] [00:62:35] I have got to be able to spend more time with myself and feel comfortable about it. Does that make sense? 
I don't mean I'm going to hide from people because I do see friends. And I'm around those people all day long so it's not like I'm a hermit. But I want to be able to get [inaudible] [00:62:54] and make the apartment livable and come home quietly. I think I want to be able to do the mundane thing out of work and feel okay with it. I'm thinking about.
COUNSELOR: Worrying what you meant.
PATIENT: Because I couldn't [inaudible] [00:63:11]
COUNSELOR: What made you think that?
PATIENT: Because you went (laughs).
COUNSELOR: Well you were [inaudible] [00:63:16].
(Laughter)
PATIENT: Rap this day up. It's too old. 
(Laughter)
COUNSELOR: Well you just did pick something up because part of what that expression was there's - I think my reaction to that was something about that sound - I understand what you're saying that you want to just [inaudible] [00:63:36] get through - not avoid it. But something about the way you were describing that sounds so ... like deprivation. And I can't allow myself to have.
PATIENT: To show that that [inaudible] [00:63:48]
COUNSELOR: Well I wouldn't think it's so much show. We could talk about that but my opinion on it was I can't allow myself to have pleasant. I have to deal with this. You know which is a pretty.
PATIENT: That's the way I look at it. You're absolutely right. Absolutely right.
COUNSELOR: What was that like for you to have heard?
PATIENT: I have - tend to be.
[Videotape stopped]
PATIENT: Well that was very - yeah I mean it was - it was good to hear that because that's what I do when I - I mean I was sitting there listening to myself and saying that's right. 
COUNSELOR: That's representative?
PATIENT: I felt like it was a pass to just sort of get this done. I want to get busy. I'm going to do this and then - never just letting go.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's more the critical boom, boom, boom.
PATIENT: Bing, bang, boom - deprivation. And that's the family I come from. Like my mother [inaudible] [00:64:37]. Yeah it's a ... geez (laughs) Oh God. The kind - I mean it's so much a part of me that I don't even realize it.
COUNSELOR: No. I know these things that you believe in.
PATIENT: The task master.
COUNSELOR: Right. Right. Right. Sort of punitive, super ego is what they call it and it.
PATIENT: Punitive?
COUNSELOR: Punitive super ego.
PATIENT: Now what does that mean punitive - is it like?
COUNSELOR: Well the punitive is a punishing - the super ego is a part of your [inaudible] [00:65:08] experience. Psychology that sort of tells you what to do with you know.
PATIENT: Right. Right. Right.
COUNSELOR: That part of you - it's the dictator of your brain.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Basically so it's telling you what you need to do - you should do without using [inaudible] [00:65:22]
PATIENT: In my life.
COUNSELOR: To take care of. Yeah.
PATIENT: Now how does one get rid of all of this? You're not going to tell me that but what's the best thing to do to get away from the punitive super ego?
COUNSELOR: You hang out with people who don't have a punitive super ego.
(Laughter)
PATIENT: It's funny the guy who's doing my apartment is like that but he's the [inaudible] [00:65:41] and doing the drugs. And so we don't want that to be.
COUNSELOR: No.
(Laughter)
PATIENT: A good time.
(Laughter)
PATIENT: So that's all I need to know - okay.
COUNSELOR: You watch with me but I would like to get your - some feedback from you about how you found this - this process and.
PATIENT: Well I can pretty much tell him concerning what - and I want to know what else to tell you. 
COUNSELOR: Did there seem to be a little [inaudible] [00:66:09] about it - a little tension between us? [Inaudible] [00:66:12] experience this way and let you know. No well that's not it.
PATIENT: [Inaudible] [00:66:19] (laughs)
COUNSELOR: Oh don't let me out of hook. Maybe I was pushing you a little bit. 
PATIENT: No. 
(Laughter)
PATIENT: It's hard to go into all of this.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean it's just hard to because ... I mean I think that's all it is. It's just tedious. It's like the question is a tedious one and.
COUNSELOR: It's hard to think about this stuff.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
COUNSELOR: It really is. [Think of this - think of that] (ph).
PATIENT: Oh yeah. And I guess what I hope is that I can continue ... thinking about it in a way that's constructive. I mean that's what I hope that I can remember the things that I did. I mean that's one of the reasons why - I mean I wasn't just being a humanitarian here when I wanted to come back to see you. I wanted to see a session. I wanted to rap it up in my own mind to make it have significance. I would have felt kind of like it wasn't complete how I left you here. 
But in terms of your probing I mean I come to - that comfortable for me to [inaudible] [00:67:22] And I didn't see why it's done because this is the - and part of the reason why I saw this is because you want to see if the process worked, or rather the therapist is working, right?
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I would - a lot of the research is interested in is sort of the quality of the relationship - how the patient and the therapist has experience with each other. 
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: And how to use that too.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: So and help it. 
PATIENT: Get across. 
COUNSELOR: Help move the therapy along.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: So that's why I was sort of asking if there was a certain awareness with Janice and her moves and her expressions that was sort of maybe underneath the surface. But that did sort of guide your own [inaudible] [00:68:03]
PATIENT: But it didn't in the beginning. It didn't in the beginning.
COUNSELOR: Not in the beginning?
PATIENT: No. No. I mean so this is just.
COUNSELOR: No. Okay.
PATIENT: This is really towards the end and everything if I recollect that.
COUNSELOR: So after you got to know her better and?
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean you can feel it - it's just a - that look in the eye. It's not even anything that's that discernable.
COUNSELOR: And that would sort of - sort of - I don't know - get your attention or something?
PATIENT: But it didn't have - yeah I mean and remember it served - I mean kind of like - I'm not trying to protect her but it served a purpose. I mean I know she's supposed to neutral. And God knows she was. I mean this was not somebody - she wasn't showing her feelings with her or you know. She was neutral. That's what would be frustrating for me at times. Do you understand what I'm saying? That I got to work at this ... in other words I can't read this.
COUNSELOR: You can't do what?
PATIENT: I'm perceptive about people. I work with people all of the time.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I know how to make somebody comfortable and on other hand I know how to win them over kind of - I couldn't do anything about this.
COUNSELOR: No. What is your usual trick?
PATIENT: That's what made it hard. Do you know what I mean? About - if I could finally pick up a little look in the eye and say ah you know and to [inaudible] [00:69:26] (laughs) What else do you [inaudible] [00:69:29]
COUNSELOR: I want it all Maddie. I want it all tonight too. (laughs)
PATIENT: It is 9:30 you know?
(Laughter)
COUNSELOR: No. You've given me a lot. So and I don't want to force anything so.
PATIENT: Okay. Okay.
COUNSELOR: So unless you have anything else [inaudible] [00:69:52].
(Laughter)
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: I so appreciate your coming back here tonight.
PATIENT: Oh don't be silly.
COUNSELOR: No. No. No.
PATIENT: Like you said well you're going to - and that day was a - I remember that was a frustrating day. And you're somebody that - you [inaudible] [00:70:03] and you know what you're doing. And I was in foot in traffic and you know when I was calling you - you remember we kept on missing each other so that was a frustrating day.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Well if you come back to us I promise you you'll never have to do this again. 
(Laughter)
PATIENT: Is that true?
COUNSELOR: The questionnaires you'll have to do but not this - the.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: This was a one shot deal for.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: [Inaudible] [00:70:23]
PATIENT: Okay. I mean that's certainly is a possibility. The only thing that would hold me back about this is probably the little patience. I can't bring attention to the other process but is that usually the case with all? I mean not that that would make that much difference. Do people after the session come back after six months?
COUNSELOR: As long as I've worked here which is now two years and two patients have come back. [Inaudible] [00:70:50]
PATIENT: It's hard to start out with somebody new?
COUNSELOR: Oh sure. Sure.
PATIENT: That's the thing.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.
PATIENT: But have you had a good success rate would you say with [inaudible] [00:71:00]?
COUNSELOR: Yeah definitely. But there are reasons why people want to go into a short term therapy. They want to work on something. They don't want to spend forever.
PATIENT: Yeah. They motivate.
COUNSELOR: Yeah exactly. They don't want to - they have a terrible fear of the kind of therapy that's going to go on and on forever and it's a legitimate fear.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: So it's nice to let therapy motivate them to make that happen too.
PATIENT: And I do think people can say what they want and sort of you know.
COUNSELOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: Get the job done. So I understand that.
COUNSELOR: But maybe now that you've made a change of therapy you can acknowledge that you want to get out of it and [inaudible] [00:71:31] to do that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It's about the kind of instrument - I mean it feels different from.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah and we would - you know Janice or the office would certainly give you other referrals if you want them.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: For your long term - come back to the institute, decide on something short term. 
PATIENT: Okay. Well that's good thinking of. Thanks so much.
COUNSELOR: Oh you're so welcome.
PATIENT: [Inaudible}] [00:71:52] I really appreciate it. Now I'm totally sane.
(Laughter)
PATIENT: I'm all fixed. 
(Laughter)
PATIENT: Bye-bye.
COUNSELOR: Bye-bye. Take care.
PATIENT: Okay. Bye-bye now.
