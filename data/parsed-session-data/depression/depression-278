BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Well, don't you feel special that way?
<b>PT:</b> In a way.
<b>DR:</b> So, what are you going to do Sunday then, sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, uh, my brother's coming back.  Um, he's been in California, training.  He comes back tomorrow, so.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.  What's he training for?
<b>PT:</b> Um, getting ready to go to Iraq.
<b>DR:</b> Ah, boo.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> We thought we were done with that.
<b>PT:</b> Nope.  He signed back up.
<b>DR:</b> He did huh?  Is, is that the bonus?  Sign up and get to go to Iraq?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, he wanted to for various reasons.  The money was a big benefit for him, but he's coming back Saturday for a week, and, um, so Sunday I'll probably go over there and do something.  I'm tired.
<b>DR:</b> You ready for your test tomorrow?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, for the most part.  I got a little bit more reading I want to do later today, but I've been studying for a good two week's now.  So there hasn't been nearly as much cramming as usual.  So, it's a little nice, not quite as heavy.
<b>DR:</b> You had another test?
<b>PT:</b> I had, uh, two tests and one, uh, Wednesday.  Today's Friday, so I had two yesterday and one Wednesday.  Yeah, one Wednesday and two Thursday.
<b>DR:</b> And they went okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  They went all right.
<b>DR:</b> Your grades have been all right the past month?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, for the most part.
<b>DR:</b> I'm not sure what that means.
<b>PT:</b> Um, mostly Cs and Bs, but I did get one or two Bs.
<b>DR:</b> For the, uh, term?
<b>PT:</b> Um, just throughout the semester.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> For various assignments.
<b>DR:</b> What are you going to end up with?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not too sure.  I haven't really calculated.  Um, I'm guessing kind of straight Cs honestly.  It's just kind of difficult getting the, it's just been difficult classes this semester.  I'm satisfied.
<b>DR:</b> When do you go back?
<b>PT:</b> As far as next semester?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  When is your next, when are you going back again?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I might be taking a summer two class, which would be late June.
<b>DR:</b> Nothing before that?
<b>PT:</b> No.  No.  Um, I'm going to go down to [DEIDENTIFIED] for a while.  That appointment at [DEIDENTIFIED] for my whole mouth deal.
<b>DR:</b> You're still having problems?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Not as, not as bad like I don't foresee anything immediate, but it is, uh, frustrating and a hassle.  My, my doctor here, through four surgeries, didn't get one scan, x-ray, MRI.  I don't know.  Confidence level in him was kind of fading since they're not able to get me in there.  I figured might as well have, you know, they're, they're known for a reason.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So, keep up with it there.
<b>DR:</b> Well, if they can help you some.  How's your mood been?
<b>PT:</b> All right.  I've been kind of down lately.
<b>DR:</b> Any reason?
<b>PT:</b> Um, a few.  Kind of worried about my brother.  That's, that's one, and then, you know, getting closer to graduation, I really have no clue what I want to do with my life.  I kind of want to teach.  Um, I wouldn't mind going, at least for a year, teaching oversees, but as far as a career, I've had thoughts.  It wasn't really, never really thought about it much, um, over the past years, and that's kind of frightening.
<b>DR:</b> You, you spent a lot of time thinking about it though.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, but -
<b>DR:</b> Where you want to be, and what do you want to be doing.  You just haven't figured out what's going to be the perfect solution.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's just I guess that there's a lot of options that I might want to do.
<b>DR:</b> Like?
<b>PT:</b> Okay, well teaching is about the only thing.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And that's even just because of, of the lack of other options.  Don't know what else I would even really want to do, but feeling that I have to make some sort of decision soon.  You know, I've got another semester that I can kind of put it off, but it's getting to the point where the whole after school thing is kind of frightening.  I've been in school now for a while.
<b>DR:</b> There's always more school.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but at the same time, I don't know if I want to do that.  It's getting kind of, I enjoy it, but it's getting kind of old.  I mean at least maybe if I go to a different school, but -
<b>DR:</b> Graduate school is different.
<b>PT:</b> Ah.
<b>DR:</b> Just like college is different than high school.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, different level.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Graduate school is not just a continuation of college.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> It's different.
<b>PT:</b> You know, that's something, I guess that's the other path I was thinking about is to continue in school, but I have no real desire to do either.
<b>DR:</b> When do you graduate?
<b>PT:</b> Huh?
<b>DR:</b> When do you graduate?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it should be one more semester.  December of next, December, yeah.  I think that's, that's just been kind of, been thinking about that lately.  I don't know if I'm down and I'm thinking about that because I'm down, or if I'm thinking of that and that's causing me to be more, you know, melancholy.
<b>DR:</b> It might make you anxious.
<b>PT:</b> It, it, I have been, I don't know how to, scientifically I think the word is, worked up into a tizzy, um, but, but yeah, a little anxious.
<b>DR:</b> Worked up.  That sounds like more than a little anxious.
<b>PT:</b> I mean it's not been, you know, I don't hyperventilate.  I don't, it just gets me tense.
<b>DR:</b> And what happens then?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, that's about it.  Then I get a little nervous, and I try to do something else.  Um, like what I've done a couple of times is I just walk around my building and just get outside.
<b>DR:</b> That helps?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not really.  [LAUGHING], but it's something I do.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> You'll pace outside instead of inside, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, actually I do find myself pacing throughout my apartment, just kind of try to switch.  I think it's just because my apartment is kind of small.  I don't walk around or nothing.  It gets me moving.
<b>DR:</b> You hanging out with anybody?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not really.  Which is the other thing.  I guess that's what's been kind of, been kind of lonely.  Um, one of my friends has graduated and moved on.
<b>DR:</b> No roommate?
<b>PT:</b> Roommate's still in Korea, and so with my brother gone though, probably five times a week I do go over to my, um, his house and watch the kids, um, for a while, so my sister in law can, you know, do, uh, dishes and such, take out the garbage there and such, so at least gets me out of the house some.  But it's family.  It's not quite the same as friends.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I did meet some people, um, not last night, the night before.  I couldn't stay out long just because I had finals, but, um, it was nice.  Probably do something later when school finishes.
<b>DR:</b> Where did you meet these people?
<b>PT:</b> Um, they were outside of [DEIDENTIFIED] and I was walking outside and going home.  They were some friends I went to high school with.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So, that was nice, but it's, it's almost, it's kind of hard.  I haven't seen the people in a while.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And it's, how have you, how have you been?  What's you been up to?  I think it's kind of hard.  I said I'm fine.  Guess not.  Yeah, I don't, I don't want to get into it with them, but you know -
<b>DR:</b> Well, they're not really asking how.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> They don't really want to know.
<b>PT:</b> But, but still, uh, you know, I feel bad that it's always a lie.  You know, I'm fine.
<b>DR:</b> You know, that's what they would like you to do.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Yeah, but, uh, it just gets hard.
<b>DR:</b> So, you'll be in [DEIDENTIFIED] how long?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I'll probably stay there for two, uh, I'll stay a week.  I'll probably plan for two weeks, but it gets boring there.
<b>DR:</b> Well, what would you do when you get back here?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I've got a, most likely a job lined up with, uh, doing fire alarms.
<b>DR:</b> Doing that again?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You haven't heard yet?
<b>PT:</b> Huh?
<b>DR:</b> You haven't heard if you got the job?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it's, I'll be able to work.  It just depends on if it's going to be like full time, um, or if it's going to be part time as far as, um, you know, working at, it still technically will be part time, but if I was working full time hours during the summer, or if they only need me three days a week.  That's what's kind of iffy right now.  Um, but if it's, it's part time, I might try to find something that I can do full time during the summer.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because I think that, that was good for me before when I worked there.  You know, it kept me busy.  You know, I was with people, and, uh, so yeah, I think that's probably what I'm going to try to do.
<b>DR:</b> What else are you worrying about these days?
<b>PT:</b> Um, my brother's probably the big one.
<b>DR:</b> I would think so.  It wasn't before, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Well, it wasn't quite as bad until he signed up for, to be the guy in the turret, and, uh, so now he's got a bit, little bit more in the line of fire.
<b>DR:</b> What's he going to do?
<b>PT:</b> He'll, he'll be a [DEIDENTIFIED] security, one for the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, he is going to be in there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So, but Iraq is not as bad.  It's not, you know, it's better than Afghanistan, but still, I mean there's still a risk there and I tend to think worst case scenario, and, uh, yeah, I have a lot of worries.
<b>DR:</b> So when you told him, when he told you that he was going to re-enlist, what did you, what did you say?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, that's nice.  I think something along that line because I knew he, when he first, when he enlisted, it was, he was just going to be on base around here, and I figured that's not bad.  You know, there's the, you know, he might be deployed, but, uh, then he signed up, you know, for deployment.  You know, it's what he wants to do and I try to be supportive, but it's hard to have reservations, but I mean if I, if I were in his place, and I mean the Army's what he likes to do, um, I'd want to be the guy with the big gun too.  So, can't really blame him.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Especially with having his two kids.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And his kind of argument was, uh, you know, they're young.  They won't, you know, they'll miss him now, but they won't remember him being gone.  Yeah, but I mean if you don't come back, you're going to be gone forever.  That's my argument, but -
<b>DR:</b> What's his wife think?
<b>PT:</b> Um, she doesn't really necessarily like it, I mean obviously, but she's very, more supportive than me I would say.  She kind of realizes that, um, his sense of fulfillment wasn't quite, um, satiated with his last tour with, uh, his marriage kind of falling apart at the end there, and all of that.  So, he, he's got a sense of duty that he needs to do, and she sees that, and wants him to do whatever he wants to do, but it doesn't mean she's not going to make him change every diaper while he's here for this week.
<b>DR:</b> When does he leave?
<b>PT:</b> Um, he's here for a week, and then he goes to Georgia for a while, and then he leaves sometime mid June to actually go to Iraq.
<b>DR:</b> And when are you leaving?
<b>PT:</b> For [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know.  We've got the appointment set up for, well actually the end of May, but we're changing it.  I'm pushing it back to later June.  Um, probably right after he leaves is when I'll go.  Um, but just because, uh, I saw the, the doctor before.  He wants the films of it get infected and of course, now it's not getting infected.  So, you know, I need to wait for it to get infected, get the films before I see him because otherwise it's, he's already got normal films of me.  So that's kind of play it by ear.  So that's why I'm going down to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Nice to have a little bit freedom [INAUDIBLE] your schedule.  You going to work at all?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um, it just depends on, as soon as I get back from [DEIDENTIFIED].  I've been in touch with the boss.  They're pretty flexible.  Um, the only thing is if they decide to give me part time, I'll have to find probably another job maybe, but, um, I'll probably work most of late, you know, hopefully the last week in June and then through July.  Um, and that's only because, uh, my summer two class is very unlikely that I'll take.  Um, but if that class, if I end up taking this class, then I'll probably just find some part time job.  There's a lot of variables in there.
<b>DR:</b> Medicine okay?
<b>PT:</b> Huh?
<b>DR:</b> Medicine okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um, for the most part.  Sleeping has been taking a little longer, and that's usually when I get the most worked up I mean once in a while, but, um, I don't know if necessarily I'd want to change anything.  I think as far as depression wise, I think the addition of the Cymbalta, that's, that's pretty much keeping things where it needs to be.  Um, I'm a little down, but it's nothing, I'm not thinking suicidal thoughts, or anything that I need to be over-worried about.  Um, a little more worrisome, but I've got a feeling it's one of those down times.
<b>DR:</b> What are you doing when you have down times now, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Honestly, usually mope around.
<b>DR:</b> Sleep?
<b>PT:</b> I, I try to sleep.  I end up usually just laying in bed watching Seinfeld or something, but, um, it gets increasingly hard when I'm depressed to get out of the house.  Um, I've been doing a lot of cooking.  I mean, you know, little small projects like that.  I'll pick a, you know, a recipe out and I'll kind of have some project to do, get my mind off things, and that kind of helps to have something to do, a mission of some sort, but that's about it.  Nothing really [INAUDIBLE] I wouldn't say.
<b>DR:</b> Nothing?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I mean I'm sure there's better things I can do, but, uh, I'm, I'm just kind of, I guess I'm used to a lot of it, but I just kind of let a lot more slide than I should as far as keeping that mindset.  I have little tricks that I tell myself work.  I walk around the building.  I, I have little things.  I play the drums, and they're, they're temporary release, but they don't really solve anything I guess.
<b>DR:</b> No.  It seems like they might at the time, but -
<b>PT:</b> It's just, you know, some sort of repression getting it off my mind for now, but, uh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What else this summer?  Anything else coming up?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not, nothing really planned.
<b>DR:</b> Mom okay?
<b>PT:</b> Huh?
<b>DR:</b> Your mom's okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She's, uh, excited.  They're coming, um, down next weekend while my brother's, you know, here this weekend.  So she's happy to see them.  Not just him, but, uh, the grandchildren especially.  That's what she really enjoys right now, which I do too.
<b>DR:</b> Are you set on medicines?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm pretty sure I got refills for, for everything.
<b>DR:</b> You been seeing that counselor over at [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Oh, and I've got probably the last appointment with him, you know, before summer, um, Monday, and then, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You going to see him over the summer?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I'm not sure.  I might try to at least have set up one.
<b>DR:</b> Has it been helpful?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it, it gives me, you know, somebody to talk to.  Yeah, it's a little helpful some.  [INAUDIBLE] especially with kind of, we've been dealing kind of with, uh, with social anxiety, or I don't what to call it, kind of not wanting to go outside and especially at, like class when you have 200 people, and it's hard when you're sitting that close.  It just makes me really uncomfortable.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know, you don't like the, the spotlight on you at all?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Or people knowing much about you or?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and that's, that's kind of hard especially on the scars, that people don't notice, and then when they do, they do do a double take, and I know it's just curiosity, but I don't want people looking at me and, I think it's, I don't know, especially with not having many friends and a lot of times that gets a lot of, uh, I don't know.  I don't feel connected.  I feel me and them type, yeah, if that makes sense.  So [INAUDIBLE] if it got any better.
<b>DR:</b> We'll see.
<b>PT:</b> So, that's been, that's been probably, it's been more difficult this semester than I noticed it previously, that fear of getting outside, but, um, before it was more of lack of interest, but now there's some sort of uncomfortable, underlying uncomfortableness that even going outside especially in concentrations of people, but I deal.  I mean I've got to go to class.  So it makes for -
<b>DR:</b> You know the consequences I guess, if that's what you mean by after.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So.
<b>DR:</b> How many hours of sleep are you getting a night?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, probably five, six.
<b>DR:</b> Why so few?
<b>PT:</b> Huh?
<b>DR:</b> Why not eight or nine?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know.  I usually lie in bed.  Um, it takes me a long time to get to sleep and, you know, semi practical if I have to get up at 8:00 to go to sleep at 8:00, you know, lie in bed for four hours before I can get to sleep, or however, you know, however long.  So it's, it's, I don't know if it's partially timing, you know, trying to judge, you know, when do I need to take my pills as far as when do I need to try to get to bed, but it's, you know, somewhat inconsistent as far as some nights I have less trouble getting to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  Once you're asleep -
<b>PT:</b> Huh?
<b>DR:</b> Once you're asleep, you don't have any like insomnia during the middle of the night?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it depends.  Um, sometimes I have to get up a lot to pee because I drank a lot, and sometimes that woke me up and I won't be able to go back to sleep.  Um, but what I found is, you know, I end up doing is, I'll get kind of, um, you know, half asleep and not be able to sleep, so I'll figure okay, I'll walk around the apartment for a few minutes, get up, do whatever, and then I'm up and I'm just kind of either sitting, the only [INAUDIBLE], you know, flipping through the channels or, um, whatever, and then I try to avoid the bed for some reason because then it's, I'm lost with my thoughts I guess.  So, that half asleep stage is one of my favorites because not much going on up here.  So I'm kind of awake, conscious -
<b>DR:</b> To do what?
<b>PT:</b> Um, watch TV.  I, I can't read a lot.
<b>DR:</b> You're not going to watch a bunch of TV.
<b>PT:</b> It's, well the history, um, I found out late at night, um, um, E TV plays, uh, German news, the English version, and then a BBC world.  So I sometimes will watch that, but I mean there's a point like at 2:00, I know I have to [INAUDIBLE] you know, regardless, but, um, I guess I'm, I'm so used not being able to fall asleep that I just, I go in until I'm almost about to pass out and then get into bed, I guess, um, if I'm up.  You know, if I'm not already lying in bed for that long, but on average, five to six hours a night.
<b>DR:</b> How do you do, do you do a little better with eight hours?
<b>PT:</b> I do a lot better.  Um, uh, and it's not necessarily the length as much as good sleep.  Like if I'm tossing and turning for eight hours, it won't be as good as, you know, six hours of -
<b>DR:</b> Does that wake you up when you toss and turn?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  That, or I have to have the place cold.  If I sweat or get too hot, that usually gets me up.  So there's, there's, yeah, a few environmental conditions that I know that I have to, um, set.  Luckily, noise doesn't bother me too much being where I am.  I've been able to pretty much block out the train, the sirens and the bar, but, uh, the temperature is usually good.  So, if I'm, if I'm tossing and turning, it's because it's too hot.
<b>DR:</b> Self esteem seems okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's all right.
<b>DR:</b> Not too shaky?
<b>PT:</b> Huh?
<b>DR:</b> Not too shaky?
<b>PT:</b> It's, it's getting better I would say.  I had a little problem this semester with some of my papers weren't as good as, I thought I could, uh, um, and that, that was hard, but I worked it out.  You know, they weren't Fs, but, you know, with this much school [INAUDIBLE] I should be able to, and that kind of knocked me down a few days, but, um, as far as self esteem, the thing that really got me kind of going is my drumming.  I have an electric drum set that I can play consistently.  I, um, like when I first started in middle school, I was always the first chair, and some of that is having that skill come back, um, doing things that I haven't done in a long time as far as drumming is concerned, really helps I would say the self esteem.  Um, almost [INAUDIBLE] but it's totally coming back.  It's hard.  I just always feel like an idiot.  I don't know.  Like even the friends that I saw, I doubt, you know, I've [INAUDIBLE] I bet they don't really like me, but, uh, at the same time, I don't think that's true, but that's life.
<b>DR:</b> You're concerned with this idle time I guess that you got coming up.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's why I'm going to, well, what's nice, what's semi nice about my brother being gone is that I've been able to go over there a lot and help out.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Watch the kids, um, put up half a fence the other weekend with my grandpa.  You know, it's stuff like that.  It, it gets me out.  It makes me feel useful.  Um, it takes up my time.  So, that, that's, that's nice to, you know, not just for me, but for them.  It gets me down there to help out, but yeah, I worry about, you know, if I'm left to my own devices.  Like I, I know suicide right now is not really an option for me.  Um, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Remember that one.
<b>PT:</b> It's, it's mentally draining.
<b>DR:</b> Still like that.
<b>PT:</b> Really.  So, um, but you know, I, I still always wonder, you know, down the road if I'm left to my own devices, if I'm 35 living alone, you know, will, you know, will something make me snap and that's, that's something I, not often, but sometimes.  You know, then what's the point of all this now?  And that's kind of, I guess that's something else I worry about.  If all I've done is for naught as far as I would I have been better off say, you know, dying before, but I don't think so, but there's always going to be, I think, a part of me that thinks that way, and that kind of scares me.
<b>DR:</b> That makes sense.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Rational.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think look, looking long term is sometimes difficult for me.  Long term is more five years than 10 or 20.
<b>DR:</b> You don't say much about your dad.  Is he doing okay?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Um, yeah.  He's working.  You know, we talk probably like four, five times a week.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> Well, maybe not that much.  I talk to my mom probably that much.  I probably talk to my dad three times a week.  Just mostly because my mom's, here's your dad, and then he just gets handed the phone, but, uh, he's doing well.  He's, he's been having problems with his eyes as far as he had detached retinas and such, but, uh, he's doing well.
<b>DR:</b> The [DEIDENTIFIED] that you're going to is the one in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You have to let me know how that goes.  I sent a couple of people down there.  They've had pretty good results.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have my, um, an initial visit, not too, I don't know.  It's been a couple of months.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's so much better, a little waiting, very, it's I mean what you'd expect from somebody who's, I mean I guess isn't well known as the [DEIDENTIFIED] for being [INAUDIBLE].  You know, the doctors, it didn't seem like they were just looking for symptoms or, they really took you as an individual in a holistic more sense.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's their approach.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> They look at everything.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  But the facility down there is very nice as well.
<b>DR:</b> Where's it at?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not too far from my parent's house, um, off [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Is it?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it's, it's not like right downtown [DEIDENTIFIED], but it's not too far from [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> I guess I was thinking that your counseling before when you talked about it, you talked about it very positive, like it was very helpful -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And I'm not hearing that from you right now.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, it's, well mostly it does, it lets me talk like, in some ways, I can't talk to my, I can't talk to really my parents about -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Anything suicidal because they get, you know, even if I feel somewhat down, they always, you know, well, you don't feel like hurting yourself.
<b>DR:</b> Of course.
<b>PT:</b> So, it's, it's something that, um, you know, about once every week, I can go and say, you know, I felt like hurting myself.  You know, or it allows me to just talk about it, and what I found that I, I've thought these thoughts for so long that they sound normal in my head, but as soon as I say them, you know, they get stopped up in my throat or I feel uncomfortable, you know, and then that's a good indicator that there's something that wrong with that line of thinking, and I think that's where it's been helpful as far as just being able to get things off my chest.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because for a while there, I was, uh, [INAUDIBLE] frustration.  I don't, that's one thing I could never understand, where, where the urge comes from in me, but you know, I, you know, it really makes a lot of people uncomfortable, even people, you know, friends I don't talk about it.  You know, I'm not feeling well.  That's the subject that -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Makes people uncomfortable.  For me to be able to talk to somebody about that, that's, no offense, not $85, but, um, yeah, that's, that's, that's where it's been helpful.
<b>DR:</b> But you're not going to be doing that this summer?
<b>PT:</b> Um, the person that I see now is, they're done after this.
<b>DR:</b> This term?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um, so I mean, you know, for next semester, I'm going to have to get somebody new anyway.  I think that's something I want to continue.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, but as far as this summer, I don't know if I want to, you know, go ahead and start with somebody new.
<b>DR:</b> If they're going to be there in the fall -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> It'd probably be a good idea.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If it's going to be the same person.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I guess I'm just thinking, um, I don't like the down time you have.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's a lot of time.
<b>PT:</b> It, yeah.  Well, I've even debated moving in over at my sister in laws.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's kind of what I was wondering too.  Why don't you just stay there?
<b>PT:</b> Um, and that's something I was going to bring up.  Actually I'm seeing her later tonight, and I was going to run it by her, and I'm pretty sure my brother would be okay with that.
<b>DR:</b> I think he'd prefer it.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Um, but so that's something I'm thinking about seriously, but, um -
<b>DR:</b> You know, because, you know, you know, you're thinking about what the heck am I going to do when I graduate [INAUDIBLE] questions, and what am I going to do with my life and we all need a purpose.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> We all need, and I think you get that from going over to your brother's.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I do.
<b>DR:</b> You get a sense that you're, you're doing something and providing a service and helpful and connection and -
<b>PT:</b> Right.  You know, my only reservation is, um, I pretty much resigned myself to [INAUDIBLE].  Um, I don't want to pull [INAUDIBLE] family to get that out with them, if that [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I understand that, I understand that's a theory you have.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I -
<b>DR:</b> But I -
<b>PT:</b> I find it [INAUDIBLE] to marry me.
<b>DR:</b> You never know.
<b>PT:</b> I mean [INAUDIBLE] that way.
<b>DR:</b> You just never know, and you're not going to know unless you're out there.
<b>PT:</b> Right, but I mean I don't want to just go jumping and get out there.  So -
<b>DR:</b> Well, but, but, by doing that, what I mean is you're not just holed up in your bedroom though.  You're out there.  You're going to school.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're going to graduate.  You're going to get a job.  You've talked a lot about, you know, teaching over in Germany.  You really need to pursue that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think that's, you know, I might not have [INAUDIBLE].  I can see myself teaching here and there, doing the overseas thing, but that would give me the chance to, you know, I could stay somewhere for five years, and then I could move.
<b>DR:</b> It'd be unlikely you'd have the same job the rest of your life.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, I mean or even the same field.
<b>DR:</b> Most people don't.  Most people have change of jobs -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> At least once.  At least.  [INAUDIBLE] put a little pressure on yourself to do it.
<b>PT:</b> You know, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Just right.
<b>PT:</b> Part of, uh, the problem with the education system that I was told that, you know, you pick your dreams out.  You can be whatever you want, all this stuff, but they never really prepared me for making choices, or really realistically what to expect.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I agree.  I agree.  That's a lot on your own.
<b>PT:</b> Or this, or this feeling that, uh, life started later.  That school was preparation for life, when all this time I -
<b>DR:</b> You've been [INAUDIBLE] in your life.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Kind of a feeling with the depression that I've lost a lot of time, that the best years of my life were spent in my room.
<b>DR:</b> You know, it's interesting, you put it, uh, that way because I don't know -
