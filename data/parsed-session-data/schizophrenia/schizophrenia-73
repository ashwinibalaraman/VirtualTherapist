Every few months, when the depression becomes
intolerable, Marie goes to her friend Gino's house to
shoot up. The house is on top of a high hill in the inner
city, and from its windows you can see silver buildings
jabbing into Boston's clouds. Marie looks out those
windows and then she lies next to Gino on the bed.
Rubber tube, bent and rusty spoon, snow. I imagine
her arms now. They are long, covered with the finest
fuzz of hair, and the veins sprawl just beneath the skin.
The veins rise up to the pressure of the knot, bulge
blue. She shares the needle, much to my chagrin, with
this man Gino, who is parchment from hepatitis, who
has sores on his lips. They share the needle, exchanging
not just dope but maybe something more essential,
cells, molecules, the tiniest atoms, where, in each center,
hexagons spin and spin with life.

She has little life, this Marie. I am so fond of her I
sometimes whisper under my breath, "<i>My Marie</i>."
But she is not a child and would not, probably, take
well to such endearments. She wears black combat
boots, tight black jeans, an old stretched sweatshirt.
Most of the time she moves slowly, as if in slumber.
She sleeps fifteen, sixteen hours a day, wakes just as
the light loosens from the sky and drops down. When
she comes to my office at the outpatient clinic,
crumbs of sleep are still clustered in her eyes. "I've
never been happy for more than maybe ten hours,"
she announces. She strokes her long arm, and I stare
and stare, trying to see the needle mark, imagining a
tiny hole in her skin into which I might slip, inside of
which I might find the vivid parts of my Marie, yellow
meadows of fat, fans of bone. Her breath.


She initially sought out treatment with me in October,
my first year at the clinic, because, as she put it, "I
cannot take being depressed anymore."


<i>Depression</i>, I thought to myself then. It's a psychiatric
disorder suffered by one in ten Americans and,
despite the severe pain an all-out bout can inflict—
lack of appetite, dwindled sex drive, crying jags that
last for hours—it's still remarkably banal, as common
as the common cold. At its best, I viewed depression
as a bronchitis of the brain, undeniably difficult but

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But I'm ahead of myself. She didn't come to me for
reasons that had to do with God. At five feet seven
inches tall, she weighed in at just over a hundred
pounds. Her eyes seemed to slouch in their sockets
and her skin had the damp, whitish look of larvae.


"For how long has it been like this?" I asked.


"Forever," she said. "Just about for—" She
stopped. "I don't know how—" Stopped again. And
stared out the window, stared at the ceiling, such long
pauses between her utterances I wondered if she'd
forgotten them, all words disappearing into the mud
of her mind.


"Forever?" I prompted. "You said forever?"


She turned her gaze back to me. "It's always been a
fucking battle," Marie said. "Sometimes a little bit

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She went on, in her slow, stop-and-start voice, to
explain how she'd never held down a job because of
her grief, how she'd been on every antidepressant
medication then available (this was before Prozac)
and had improved on none. Her condition caused her
days of paralysis, and, as a result, she lived with her
two children in a barely furnished apartment in one
of the city's housing projects. "If I could feel better for
anything more than a couple of split seconds," she
said to me that first session, "then maybe I'd have the
energy to get off welfare and stay with a job long
enough to make real money."


I had a lot of optimism when I first started with
Marie. If one in ten Americans suffer at some point in
their lives from this kind of major depression, well
over 90 percent of them recover. Why shouldn't she?
Despite the seriousness of the disorder, it's considered
highly treatable, either through medication, which
had so far failed her, or through the standard fare of
talk therapy, which we would now try. And talk therapy
—the type I practice at the outpatient clinic—

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I began by extracting details from her, the elements of
her history, and while now I am not so sure how relevant
these elements are to the specifics of her suffering,
I will set them forth here because they are a part
of my Marie, the plot from which she springs.


In the beginning, then, we had a girl who wanted to
be a nurse. One day her mother took her to St. Margaret's
clinic to have a splinter removed—her father
usually did these kinds of things, but he was away
somewhere—and then she saw the nurses in their
starched long skirts, the fresh red crosses stitched to
their breast pockets. It must have been the contrasts
that enchanted her, the hemoglobin richness set
against the cleanest winter, red burning through
bleach. She recalled a nurse soaking her swollen finger
in a bowl of salt water, and then tweezers entering
her sore skin, withdrawing the wood, sending her to
the peak of pain, and then the lovely coolness of
crushed ice.


This was comfort, something her own home didn't
have much of. The plaster walls there were full of
holes. Her father was a muscular man who worked as
a day laborer, making one dollar and fifty-two cents
an hour. His comfort was vodka, his release a rage
that could send Marie or one of her sisters slamming
against a wall. Her mother's comfort was food and
fatness. Nights, her father would sit in the den, shot

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Like she was a witch," Marie said to me during
the first few months of therapy. "Like I lived in a

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"There was no soothing where you grew up," I said
to her. "Your father abused you, your mother frightened
you. Tell me more."


I asked her to tell me more because I was betting on
a cycle of reconnecting and remembering, the tongue
exorcising the trauma. Because I thought if a patient
could talk about the trauma, bring it to consciousness,
then she could eject it. Once ejected, such a
patient would be free to refashion the trauma, to
reclaim it in new form, much the way a doctor gently
lifts the heart from its socket, cleans the wheezing
arteries, and then sets it back in its bed of muscle.


But this is not exactly what happened with Marie.
Talking about her past—that combination of catharsis
and insight—did little to relieve her pain. Week
after week she came dragging her depression to treatment.
She did occasionally have "good days," but, as
she had told me at the very outset, these good days
had occurred throughout her life, brief periods of

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Sometimes," Marie said to me, "it happens when
I'm in the shower. Or when I step out of the shower
and the water begins to dry on my skin. There's
a ... a lifting."


And I, too, lifted, leaned forward in my seat. I
thought of fevers lifting, dew lifting and leaving the
grass a cleaner green. In her words I heard a surge of
hope, and because hope is what we all finally want,
what we are all entranced by, I held to it.


"Explain," I said.


And so she did. Over a series of meetings, she
explained these moments to me. "I was once walking
by a chapel," she said, "and the bells began to gong. It

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"If only you could keep that aliveness," I murmured,
and I was thinking then of moments in my
own life when the world had presented itself to me
all shucked and gleaming. How once, in England, I
had gone to a dilapidated cathedral, where images of
angels were etched in the walls, and found, in the
tiny cracks between the graying stones, beautiful
swatches of emerald moss and pearl-like pebbles.
How our own bodies are like that too, opalescent
paths tucked between skins we can't see. Is that a
condition of being human, to lose light, to lose sight
of the special angles? Was Marie just an exaggeration
of us all, all of us walking a plain path, privy every
once in a while to a vision more essential, a vision we
can't keep? How often you hear people complain
that daily life is a drag, that it is better not to fall in

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"And when these moments go away," Marie said,
"I want them back and then I wish they never came
because things feel even harder afterward."


Sometimes, Marie told me, these moments would
stretch out into a couple of days, or if she were
really on a roll, maybe even into a few weeks. During
these hours she would scrub her house, pay
stacks of bills, return the messages cluttering up her
phone machine. She would rise very early, at five
A.M., and stay up past midnight. "I can't let myself
sleep too much," Marie said, "because I have energy
and it's my one chance to get things done." She
knew, in other words, that once the depression
returned, these ordinary tasks would become over-whelming,
how the sound of a dial tone would burn
in her ear, how fatigue would loosen her limbs, so
even holding a sponge—that meringue from the sea,
all airiness and ripples—would feel too hard, too
heavy.


"I'm living with a remote control inside my head. It
doesn't feel like I have a choice. A person I can't see
presses the up button and I feel better. I'm washing
my dishes, doing all this stuff. I'm singing. And then
right in the middle of the tune this invisible person

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Four months into treatment, a remission came. Marie
strode into my office one afternoon with lively eyes.
"Yup," she said to me, sitting down, "I'm in a good
mood, an excellent mood. Since last Thursday. Six
days now." She leaned forward, counting off on her
fingers and dropping her voice. "Six days and it's
awesome."


I wondered about mania, the flip side of depression,
where the mood zooms up too high and happiness
turns crazy. But none of the signs were there. Her
speech was normal, her thinking intact. "I'm eating
OK, I'm sleeping OK once I actually get to bed. I
mean I'm staying up late so I can do all the stuff I've
been putting off, but I'm out soon as I hit the pillow.
I'm just enjoying myself," she added.


I nodded, sat back in my seat. I was seeing her for
the first time without the jammed grief. I noticed the
wet whiteness of her teeth. I noticed—had it always
been there?—the soft green snake of a vein in her temple.
If I watched the vein for long enough I thought I
could see the splutter of her pulse. And then relief
went through me. Every helper wants to ease some
suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the
sense of responsibility. For a moment I didn't have

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"In the welfare office today I saw an advertisement,"
she said. "Job training. I actually signed up."


And it was true. This woman, usually so paralyzed,
now went ahead into vocational training. For the
next few weeks, while her children were in school,
Marie hustled off every day to a building in Chelsea,
where, with fourteen other welfare mothers, she
learned to mend computer hardware. She learned, in
her lightness and energy, how to pry loose the faulty
silicon chips, clip the veins of wire braided over the
bus, reknot so a fresh supply of energy flowed in. I
saw her as a doctor in some strange ritual of mending,
she probing for viruses among infected hardware, the
profound gratification of finding the ill chip and
plucking it, like an abscessed tooth, from the mother-board's
jaw.


I suppose I knew this interlude would be just that. She
had told me about her pattern. So I should have been
prepared when, one morning, three weeks into her
fine mood, I got a call from an emergency-room
physician telling me that Marie had overdosed. Could
I please give him some background information?


I don't really remember what he asked me for, or
what information I gave. Instead I was going back

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Maybe, then, something in those machines reminded
her of her early home. Maybe their ordered
loveliness contrasted too sharply with the chaos of
her history. Maybe in touching the thick and beautiful
wires of the motherboard, she remembered, by
contrast, the cold spikes in her mother's skin, and a
secret grief reopened. Or maybe not. "No reason I
can see," she muttered to me later, through cracked
lips, as she lay in her hospital bed. I didn't want there
to be no reason, just a sudden, senseless resurgence. It
went against everything I had learned, everything I
needed to believe—that psychological pain occurs for
a solid reason and rests, therefore, on some solid
sense.


But this isn't how she described it, Marie. That
evening, in the emergency room, she told me in a slow

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Marie shook her head. She had just woken up that
morning and felt the dread of that depression back on
her. She had tried to get out of bed and found she
could barely move. The idea of facing what just yesterday
she had loved appalled her. The wires would
look ugly, rotting tendons on greased machines. The
gas plasma screens would reek, glow a fetid green.
She couldn't go. She just couldn't go. Her heart hammered
and every second squeezed inside. Morning
passed into noon, noon into dusk. The dusk was dirty
and her face in the mirror looked streaked with soot.
She knew the few weeks of energy, the few weeks
where she had had the capacity again to experience
love, were gone. When her children came home she
would not recognize them, their teeth like tombstones,
the holes in their noses too wide. She rushed
out of the house.


She told me all of this slowly as I sat on the edge of
the hospital bed. She looked up at the ceiling, her
voice as bleak as a British moor. Some of the color

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And so she had rushed out of the house and up the
hill to Gino's. The needle in her skin felt good, felt
something. She didn't put it in her arm but in her
chest, in the ravine between the breasts, shooting
directly into the large thick vein over the heart. In an
instant a white and cottony relief enveloped her, and,
before she dropped into an unconscious dream, she
envisioned her body as the inside of a machine, all
the parts gleaming, the silicon slab of her heart
recharged, relieved.


An accidental overdose, meant for relief, not death.
The emergency-room doctor told me she had railed
against the Naloxone they'd injected into her to block
the opiate's action. After she was medically cleared,
the plan was to transfer her to the hospital's psychiatric
floor until she was stable again. When I had
gone to see her that evening, I had looked into her
face, barely distinguishable from the paleness of the
pillow, and I didn't know what to do, how to explain
this strange cycle of suffering and redemption either
to her or to myself.


She was on the psychiatric unit for two days. I went
to visit her there once. The charge nurse told me
Marie refused to come out of her room except to

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was actually happy to hear about Marie's refusal
to go to groups. It spoke of some spark of anger, some
spot still scarlet within her. When I heard that, I got
yet another glimpse of Marie, this time not joyful, nor
flattened by grief, but lit red in her rage. Imagine, to
love over and over again, and then to lose the love.
Imagine fighting your way through days, sudden
spurts of light, and then drought. Depression is a
death within, a knowledge—terrifying—that you cannot
resurrect yourself. Depression is loss of the vision
that lets leaves breathe and fall, that lets the air smell
of seed and soil. And there must be rage, yes I think
there is rage toward such a severing, such a ragged-deep
rupture with the world.


She was in her room, sitting on a chair pulled up to
the window. Below her, patients wandered around a
fenced lawn.


I drew up a chair and sat beside Marie. For a long
time we said nothing. I searched her profile, as
though in its angles I might find clues about what to
do next.


"I don't understand it," she finally said. "But as long
as I go on this way, I'll never accomplish anything."


"School," I said. "Like school."

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Fuck that," she spit. "My children. <i>The air</i>."


"The air?"


"It's like I forget how to breathe." She hunched
over herself. "And when that happens I'll do anything
to get my breath back. Heroin helps."


"What makes you want to keep on breathing? I
mean, why do you keep swimming to shore, after all
these years? Do you ever think of just letting yourself
drown?"


"Yes, I do," Marie said.


"What stops you?" My voice cracked. It's frightening
to speak of death directly, especially death as a
choice. Even though all the writings on suicide say
talking about it will never put such an idea, or worse,
such an impulse, into someone's head, I've always
been hesitant anyway. Maybe because to speak of
something is to radically reveal it, and suddenly
Marie and I were swimming, or drowning, in some
new space.


"I don't know," Marie said. She slowly shook her
head. "Every time it gets this bad, I think, ‘Marie, you
know it'll get better. You have your good days. Your
great days, even.’ I remember my moments, because
whenever I have them, I think, ‘This time it'll last.
This is so fucking good.’ And so I hang on. And on."


She stopped. It was evening now, and outside a
searchlight angled across the city sky. Where did that

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We wait for them, still breathing.


These days, the managed-care health system demands
that a patient be discharged as soon as the imminent
danger has passed. There's no extra time for staff to
do aftercare planning or simply soothe a tired mind.
"Are you feeling suicidal or self-destructive today?"
the hospital staff must ask. And if the patient answers
no, fiscal concerns demand discharge, despite the fact

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So it was that Marie, with barely enough energy to
talk, was released from the psychiatric unit within
forty-eight hours. She was no longer considered "a
danger to self or others." She was given two subway
tokens and told to make her way back home. Because
home was far from the hospital, though, the subway
tokens covered only half her trip. Without money,
then, and still sluggish, she found herself lost in the
center of a busy downtown and was forced to spend
the night in a homeless shelter, on a cot amid a row of
cots and rumpled women whose breath smelled of
beer and ash. By the time she made it to her appointment
with me the following day, her face and hair
were damp with oil and her lips were chapped, the fissures
bleeding lightly.


Seeing her, I panicked. I wanted lotions and soaps,
cups of steeped tea I could feed her. I wanted—an
urge so strong it surprised me—to make her a meal,
that wish for eggs I could crack against a steaming
skillet, the gentleness of yolks.


"Marie, Marie," I said softly.


She cried in my office that day, head in cupped
hands, body bent. "I don't know," she kept repeating.


"We'll figure this out," I said, but I wasn't very sure.

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had learned other methods of working with
depression, and over the next few months of therapy
we would try them out. Insight, obviously, had been a
failure. Something else had to work. My panic came
from real failure, but more so from being over-whelmed.
Who wants to witness hurting in another?
Who wants to stand by and watch blood? Better to
bandage it up. Now I think I know—although I didn't
then—that sometimes all we can do is align ourselves
with the wound, respect its oozings and witness its
crimson colors. Sometimes all we can do is keep company
with the person who hurts. I did not know then
that this in and of itself just might constitute help.


Help would be to make better, to relieve. So we tried
something called cognitive therapy, the main point of
which was to get Marie to alter her attitude toward
pain. This kind of treatment springs from work with
patients who have had chronic physical illnesses. The
theory goes that if patients can learn not to react with
anxiety or tension when they have a bad sensation, if
they can learn to relax and accept the pain, they will
lessen the grip the suffering has over their skin. In
other words, pain does not exist apart from perception,
and if a patient can change her perception of
pain, then she has, in effect, changed the pain itself.

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Marie and I worked on tweaking her perception of
pain. Was it really as bad as she thought it was? How
many hours a day was she actually depressed, and
could she log those hours in a book? By logging them,
did she begin to notice that things weren't quite as terrible
as she assumed? Could she practice saying to
herself, "This hurts but it won't kill me? This is only
a feeling, not a fact?"


Marie's response to this treatment after some
weeks: "Yes, it's only a feeling but it still does hurt.
No, I'm not overestimating my depression and the
number of hours a day I feel it. What you want," she
said to me, "is for me to be less depressed about being
depressed." She shrugged. "I can't accept that."


We tried looking at depression from a feminist perspective
and engendering some sort of political anger
on her part. No go. We tried a purely behavioral
approach—Marie forcing herself up out of bed, calling
three friends a day, showering regularly. No go.
One night during this time I was at a friend's house
and I picked up the remote control for the television.
I pressed 1, 2, 3. I pressed &gt; for volume up and &lt; for
volume down. I pictured Marie miles and miles away,
her mind twitching and swirling as I held the electrical
box, a yellow slice of sun edging over the rim of
her brain, a saint placing some cool moss on her forehead.

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This all happened at the particular moment in medication
history when Prozac was emerging. Marie had
been tried on the entire range of antidepressant medication
over the years of her illness, but none had
done the trick. Now we were just beginning to learn
about this new kind of medication that had had some
grand successes. <i>Just maybe</i>, we thought, <i>it will work</i>.
Marie was hopeful. I knew something about how
Prozac had been made, how, unlike other psychiatric
medications, it had been designed to cut a clear path
to the problem in the brain, acting on a certain specific
neurotransmitter. Whereas the older types of
antidepressants were clumsy in their actions, tweaking
all sorts of unnecessary synapses in their stumbling
journey to the particular sore spot and causing,
therefore, a whole range of unpleasant side effects,
Prozac was like a supremely coordinated athlete, a
hurdle jumper who cleared every fence and arrived at
the finish line with sure, smooth strides. Whether or
not this image is precisely true, I cannot say. I would
suspect not. But this is the myth that was already
growing around the capsule, the image that at least in

A week after her discharge from the hospital,
Marie saw the outpatient clinic's psychiatrist, who
prescribed her Prozac. Twice a day now, once in the
morning and once in the evening, she ingested her
pills. I pictured her standing by the kitchen window, a
glass of water, the amber bottle. It would take several
weeks to work. Now we had to wait.


Once I had read a series of accounts about some
amazing and sickening brain operations. I can't recall
all the places I found these accounts, because this was
a long time ago, well before I knew Marie. But the
images from these surgical descriptions returned to
me just at this point in our treatment.


I recalled reading of a man lying on an operating
table. Surgeons hovered around him. In the patient's
head was a hole caused by a cancer that had eaten
through the patient's scalp, revealing the brain, gray
and pink, surrounded by cerebral fluid that now and
then burbled over and dripped down the man's
stripped scalp. When that happened, one of the
attending nurses would dab at the wound with a sterile
cloth, wiping away the wetness. The doctors, in
the meantime, cut away at the cancerous hunk of

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Yes, it was at this point that I remembered reading
about these operations and the questions they had
then, and now, brought forth in me. Because twice a
day Marie swallowed her pills and nothing happened,
even after weeks and weeks. It's not that I then
thought I should advocate suicide. It was more that I,
like those gloved surgeons, could not accept the
naked pain, could not stop trying to cut and clean, to
remove the stone of suffering that sometimes sits in
the center of our lives. Modern medicine, of which
psychiatry and psychology are a part, is, as the critic
David Morris writes, "fundamentally anti-tragic in
[its] vision, simply cannot go on gripped by a vision
of permanent defeat."


And yet here we were, Marie and I, defeated. Ten,
eleven, twelve weeks went by and the Prozac did not,
as they say, kick in. I went home then, and lay on my
bed. Marie went home and lay on hers. Although I

And so I began, slowly, in knowing Marie, to think
about staying in suffering instead of always trying to
climb out of it. Do not mistake me. I don't mean I
learned to embrace pain, whose boiling body frightens
me as it scalds the skin of its victims, nor, in the parlance
of New Age-speak, to accept pain, for acceptance
is far too sweet a word, and I doubt very many

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I gave up. No more interventions. No more pithy
observations or attempts at radical reconstructions.
Our sessions took, in the following days, a bit of
a different turn. "Perhaps," I said to Marie after
the psychiatrist had discontinued the Prozac, "you
won't overcome your depression. Perhaps you'll have
to ... have to learn to live with it."


Those words jammed up my gullet. I felt as though
I were betraying something, and I recalled again the
words of David Morris:
<blockquote>
<p>
Our culture teaches us to confront pain with silence
and denial. Americans today probably belong to the
first generation on earth that looks at a pain-free life
as something like a constitutional right. Pain is a
scandal.

as something like a constitutional right. Pain is a
scandal.


"Well, what would that mean?" Marie said.


I didn't know. We sat thinking about it, and it felt
as if there were a string stretched between us. The
string was not a lifeline I had thrown her, but the raw
tendon that connects people at the moment both
become willing to enter a wound—an intimacy arises

The seasons passed. By Easter there was a clearer focus
to our endeavors. We ceased discussing ways of beating
the depression and instead explored how she might
know it as an essential part of her. Jung said that the
point of therapy is to become what you fundamentally
are, the figures hunched within, fully formed from the
moment of birth, or before birth, from the moment
sperm meets seed and cells take shape. I can't in any
way claim Marie was happy about this new way we
walked, but something felt right in our strides, as if
we'd reached a rhythm. Still, I wondered, what kind of
rhythm was it? What kind of plot did we have here?
Marie certainly still spent days bleary with pain, and if
there's any epiphany in this tale, any kind of crescendo,
it comes at least as much from my need to shape a narration
of progress—what after all, is therapy, if not a
story of progress?—as it does from her experience.


But maybe, just maybe, we should cease thinking of
therapy as a story moving forward. Such a story
could be harmful to people who are bound to feel like
failures in a milieu where the expectation of improvement
is so clearly etched. Perhaps the therapist's job is

And when we looked out the window of my office,
we saw rain silvered in a streetlight. We saw the
frailest of halos. Black umbrellas were as sleek as the
coats of seals. I began to notice small things as therapy
continued, and sometimes my sight felt so clear
objects were transformed, so the pale fuzz on my
lover's nape deepened to gold, a field of soft wheat in
the summer. I wondered then if I was taking on some
of Marie's heightened moments, some of her occasional

During those sessions we discussed the ways
throughout history that people have tried to make
sense of their suffering, old myths about Navajo
bones beginning to rise, men coming back as birds.


"Well, what about those saints?" Marie said. "Like
Sebastian. What do you think he actually saw as he
was nailed?"


"Oh, I don't know. Angels, maybe? Sunlight?"


Marie smiled then. "Computers," she said. "Those
little silicon chips and how they all go together when
you're having a good day."


"Do you ever wonder," I asked, "whether your
depression is what actually gives you such good
moments? I mean, maybe one of the things your pain
does is to bring you a kind of sharpness of vision."


"Maybe," Marie said.


I nodded.


"But big whoop-de-do." She glared at me. "That's
a fucking high price to pay for a few good times."


"Those times have kept you alive, though, haven't
they?" I was recalling what she had said to me in the
hospital, about why she had not chosen suicide.


Marie paused. "It's pretty incredible," she said,
"that I'm such a fool, that I stick around day after

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was anger in her voice, rage, even, and the
rage told me this: that Marie was a woman of great
faith, and her faith was formed by a brief succession
of seconds that never lasted. She lived out months,
years of pain on the hope of again experiencing those
brief remissions, those slivers of time when the world
went shucked, went gleaming. And while we usually
celebrate faith, I saw just then how cruel it can be, if I
were to push it, how even pathological are those
tough tethers of pleasure that keep us anchored to an
earth we can little enjoy.


I looked closely at Marie then. My Marie. We had
found no answers at all, but we had come to questions
we could ask together. And the questions
seemed so dignified—<i>what does my wound mean?</i>
And her wondering and walking in the rawest places
seemed so brave that, watching her, I came to know
all it might mean to be human.


And maybe what it means to be human is this.
Maybe it means looking down, down, until you see a
naked ankle out of which grows a mound of purplish
flesh, a lump beating with a horrible heart you yearn
to touch anyway. Maybe it means such spreads of
silence new sounds are born, and you hear the weeping
of fish, the crying inside the ocean. As a child,
