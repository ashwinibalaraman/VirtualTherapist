But the goat upon which the lot fell to be scapegoat,
shall be presented <i>alive</i> before the Lord, to
make an atonement with him, and to let him go for
a scape-goat into the wilderness.


--LEVITICUS, xiv: 10.


I HAVE always felt a sort of <i>pity</i> for that
poor "scape-goat" of ancient history, and can
more readily sincerely sympathize with him
now, since having had a similar experience.
The inspired writer failed, however, to follow
the fortunes of the poor goat, and we are left
to doubt if ever he was permitted to <i>return to
the camp</i>. Or if, while in the wilderness, any
"good Samaritan" gave him a kind word, or
proffered assistance in helping him carry his
burden, even tho ' he could not lighten it.
Probably none of these. It's more than likely,
since, as he was <i>originally</i> a tolerably willful
sort of animal, and, as would naturally be the
case, not in a very pleasant state of mind at
being obliged to shoulder other's sins, including
his own small share, by comparison, one may

The wilderness into which I was driven by
cruel Fate, aided and abetted by heartless brutality
within my own immediate household,
was the "Asylum for the Insane." Bearing
upon my body <i>suggestive marks</i>, silent witnesses
of <i>blows</i>, not given alone by the <i>tongue</i>, I
envy not that person her peace of mind, if she
possesses a conscience, who by her <i>insulting
taunts</i> and vile insinuations, continued and
<i>persisted in</i> for three days before I, in my desperation,
was <i>driven</i> to the act for which I am
called an "homicide, a person, too, to whom
I had never shown aught but kindness,
to whom <i>often</i> I had extended generous hospitality,
when my home was a pleasant place to
come to.


My first night spent at the asylum was a
dreadful one to me, although my attendants
were very considerate to me. I was placed in

Before I had been an inmate of the asylum
a week I felt a greater degree of contentment
than I had felt for a year previous. <i>Not</i> that
I was reconciled to life, but because my unhappy
condition of mind was understood, and
I was treated accordingly. Besides, I was surrounded
by others in like <i>bewildered</i>, discontented
mental state, in whose miseries, each
believing their own individual woe the greater,
I found myself becoming interested, my sympathies
becoming aroused.


I had always loved books, but, strangely
enough, had never read any thing of <i>insanity</i>,
had never thought but little about it; hence
these <i>insane people</i> were a study--an interesting
study, too. And at the same time, I <i>too</i>, was
treated as an insane woman, a kindness hitherto
not shown me, Dr. Hester being the first
person <i>kind enough</i> to say to me, in answer to
my question, "Am I insane?" "<i>Yes, madam</i>,

I had not been there long until I noticed
that certain patients in each ward were requested,
or rather <i>expected</i> to go to religious
services held in the chapel, and it caused very
anxious thought on my part. I was not inclined
<i>then</i> to disobey any of the rules, but
most certainly did not <i>intend</i> to <i>go to church</i>.
So, I asked Dr. Hester if I would ever be
<i>compelled</i> to go? "No," he said, "certainly

This subject of restraint as a <i>curative</i> in the
treatment of the insane, was again brought
before me in a conversation with our superintendent,
Dr. Orpheus Everts, a gentleman of
superior attainments and experience, and in
whom centered all the virtues constituting the
true philanthropist. I was one day standing,
as I frequently did, at the window, sunken in
the deepest melancholy, gazing at I know not
what, when I was aroused by his voice asking,
"Are you drinking in the beauties of nature?"
And truly, the view from that point was
lovely! But I answered, "I am not thinking
at all whether the sun is shining or clouded ;
but I remember when I delighted in the loveliness
of nature." "And you will again," he
