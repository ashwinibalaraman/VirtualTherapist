<b>CG:</b> Oh, my house number is uh, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> You can try that first because I'd rather talk on the, on the home phone.  I get better —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Reception and my cell phone is [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Okay, now um, you um, you brought him to county last night?
<b>CG:</b> Yes I did.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and because he's been, why did you bring him to county?
<b>CG:</b> Well because that's where the, that's where they've always taken him see —
<b>DR:</b> Okay, I know but why, why last night versus last week or next week or what?
<b>CG:</b> Oh, oh, oh because he's um, he, he can't stand, he can't handle these voices.
<b>DR:</b> Right, okay.
<b>CG:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And —
<b>CG:</b> Uh —
<b>DR:</b> Has he been taking his medication do you know?
<b>CG:</b> Uh, well he was letting me know what medication he was taking for quite sometime, since he left the hospital because the doctors were involved with him.
<b>DR:</b> When, when was the last hospitalization?
<b>CG:</b> In February, he was in there for two weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Where at?
<b>CG:</b> At [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Okay, great, okay.
<b>CG:</b> That, now he had uh, pneumonia.
<b>DR:</b> Oh —
<b>CG:</b> And they had, and they did surgery on him twice on the lungs.  His right lung was full of bacteria or something —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>CG:</b> Don't even know what.  He didn't tell me exactly what it was.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I see.
<b>CG:</b> But he had, they had, first of all they took a quarter and a half of water off of his right lung —
<b>DR:</b> Okay, we don't have to go in to the details of it.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, then did he go to psych too or he was just on the medical unit?
<b>CG:</b> He was just on the medical unit.
<b>DR:</b> When was the last time he was on a psych unit?
<b>CG:</b> Oh, about three years ago.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> Three or maybe four I, I don't really know right off hand.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and he used to be on the Risperdal Consta shot.  Do you know if he has been getting that?
<b>CG:</b> Uh, no he hasn't been getting it.  He went off from it, he went off of it after he was, after he left the hospital.
<b>DR:</b> Which uh, we're talking about this uh, one at, in February?
<b>CG:</b> Pneumonia, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so he —
<b>CG:</b> But now, he's not as good, when he went off the medication.  He went back to his normal self.
<b>DR:</b> Wait when he went off of the shot?
<b>CG:</b> Yes, those shots are way too strong for him.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so he was over medicated.
<b>CG:</b> He was way over medicated.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> He, he, what he really needs right now and I hope he gets this chance.  For somebody to re uh, re—evaluate him and see what he needs little by, a little bit by little bit —
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> You now what I mean?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah we can certainly do that but what about um —
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well prior to him going to the hospital in February was he doing okay then?
<b>CG:</b> They, would you say that again, please?
<b>DR:</b> Prior to February when he got the, the pneumonia was he doing okay?
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> He was doing okay?
<b>CG:</b> Uh, he was taking those shots but they were terrible for him.  They, he, it did not make him his person.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, when is the last time he was doing well?  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> Last time he was doing well was right before they gave him the Consta shot.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, why did they start the Consta?
<b>CG:</b> They, they started the Consta because he um, as soon as he would get feeling better, why then he said, "No I'm better."
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> I figured as long as you —
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>CG:</b> He can go off of the medicine.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I got the picture.  So, uh —
<b>CG:</b> He —
<b>DR:</b> Do you know what medication he was on prior when he was doing well?
<b>CG:</b> He was on Risperdal —
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> Uh, much, much lower dose.
<b>DR:</b> I see so they would give him the Risperdal, he would get better then he'd stop the medicine and eventually they said, "Let's do the Consta because he kept going on and off?"
<b>CG:</b> Right, um, and it was that he had to be hospitalized.
<b>DR:</b> All right, [PATIENT NAME] is that how you see it or?
<b>PT:</b> See what?
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well, all right.  Well you know what we could try, um —
<b>CG:</b> He needs re—evaluation.
<b>DR:</b> All right let's do that.  But the dilemma is, well actually there's uh, a similar medications called Invega that I've been liking a lot and we could try that and it tends to have less side effects and they actually are, some, at some point coming out with a long acting, uh, shot of the Invega and that might be better tolerated so we could try switching him over.
<b>CG:</b> Um, what is the Invega, the regular medication that, is that the regular name or is that the generic name?
<b>DR:</b> No, that's the regular name.
<b>CG:</b> Regular name, how long has that been out?
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I don't know a year or so.  Actually it's, it's similar to Risperdal but it is uh, a different medication.  I have found that, I mean I just wonder if also if he was on a lower dose of the Consta if that.  I understand he's over medicated with the Consta —
<b>CG:</b> Um—hum, I am the thing, and another thing that happens when he took the Consta is his legs hurt him so bad that he just nearly cry.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum, okay.
<b>CG:</b> They hurt him so bad.
<b>DR:</b> All right well let's —
<b>CG:</b> But I don't know if it was from the Consta or not, but it happened shortly after the Consta.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, all right.  Well we'll re—evaluate everything —
<b>CG:</b> Re—evaluate him and don't start, I, I'm not the doctor but I saw what happened to him.  He's been sick for a long time, um, well 16, 17 years and um, every time he would go off of his medication, you know, like let's say he was taking 3 mg of Risperdal —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> He was, he would get better and then he would go off of it.  Then he'd end up back in the hospital, but then as soon as they took him back because, well we've got to up that medication because it's not —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, working.
<b>CG:</b> On it.  So then they'd give him 10 mg, then the next time they'd give him 12, then 15, and then 20, why every time they just kept putting him on more and more, and more and every time he was over dosed.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and the Depakote?  Does that help?
<b>CG:</b> Uh, I'm, I really don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> I couldn't keep track of the Depakote because at the time when he was taking the Depakote I, which he just, I don't know when he quite the Depakote.
<b>DR:</b> All right —
<b>CG:</b> Now —
<b>DR:</b> All right, let me, we'll go and we'll restart things.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, I think you better restart things but I did, but I do know that he did do pretty well on the Risperdal uh, uh, the, the uh, uh, the pills —
<b>DR:</b> Pill at the right dose, okay.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right, thanks a lot.  Okay, how, you can talk to [PATIENT NAME] later.  I'm going to have to stop, but —
<b>CG:</b> Sure that's fine.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] did you want to say anything else?
<b>PT:</b> Uh —
<b>CG:</b> Probably wants a cigarette which I can't bring [INAUDIBLE] —
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and there's no smoking on the ward here so —
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, uh, you know what.  If he, if somebody would clean up and clear up his sleep apnea, his sleep apnea is so bad that it's no wonder he's got a mental illness.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Was he ever be, ever been on a CPAP?
<b>CG:</b> He can't use it because he took the test over at [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's hard to clean it up.  That's the way to do it is the CPAP, but if you're not going to use it or —
<b>CG:</b> He can't, the doctor said, "He's too far beyond that."
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> He's beyond that point she says, "He needs some surgery or he needs something done, some other place."  But she sent me to a doctor and a doctor didn't do right as far as [PATIENT NAME] was concerned and uh, we didn't go back.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> And I guess he was an excellent specialist at this —
<b>DR:</b> Is there, is —
<b>CG:</b> Uh —
<b>DR:</b> Is there a family history of people seeing psychiatrist?
<b>PT:</b> Some of —
<b>CG:</b> Uh, not really, um, except his sister because had, had, had uh, the same similar thing.  They called it <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> and uh, I, she still on medication but she was, let's, and she's taking very low doses like 2 mg a day —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>CG:</b> Something like that, you know, so that's what's helping her.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well I mean —
<b>CG:</b> And my mother, my mother was the other one that I know of.
<b>DR:</b> What is, she had a similar illness?  Was she diagnosed as schizophrenic?
<b>CG:</b> She was diagnosed as that but now she's never taken any medication for it.
<b>DR:</b> Any bipolar in the family, manic depressive illness?
<b>CG:</b> Uh, yes there is it's on his father's side not on his mother side; because we're all, on this side we're happy go lucky and on the other side there's all, everything bad, everything was bad, everything, nothing could be good, let's go out and drink.
<b>DR:</b> Okay —
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>CG:</b> His father was an alcoholic, he's an alcoholic.
<b>DR:</b> All right I see, okay.
<b>CG:</b> And then alcoholism is in that whole family, in the whole family.
<b>DR:</b> Does [PATIENT NAME] drink?
<b>CG:</b> No, not now —
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> But he did at one time but I think at the time but I think at the time the start of when he started getting sick.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, thanks a lot.
<b>CG:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, bye.
<b>CG:</b> Okay, bye—bye.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, all right and why are you scratching yourself so much?
<b>PT:</b> This, there's itchies on me, there's —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you're uh, you know, here making yourself bleed now.
<b>PT:</b> I heard, I heard that there was uh, there's ten thousand babies when I was born, I was one, one baby of then thousand babies that were born —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And they're all, [INAUDIBLE] forever, things like that.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, all right, but —
<b>PT:</b> And that's, that's see some how I think that somehow I, that some, somehow there's —
<b>DR:</b> Here give me that.
<b>PT:</b> Something must have happened, something, something must have happened when I, when that, when that —
<b>DR:</b> Watch it, okay.  Why don't we stop, why don't you go, did you get breakfast?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and take a shower and stuff and maybe that will help with the itching and stuff.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, good meeting you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay —
<b>PT:</b> I, I, I didn't know what to say —
<b>DR:</b> Okay, you did fine, you did fine.
