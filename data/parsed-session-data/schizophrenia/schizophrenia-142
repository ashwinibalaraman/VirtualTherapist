BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: Mm, ah. So I - I drove here today, and this is one of the only — maybe, like three to five times that I've driven in Hanover without nearly getting into an accident.
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Well, that's good, right? [One time] (ph)...
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, that's the particular area is good; the general (ph) is not. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Right. [Chuckles] Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, scheduling was...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, everything is normal until June, at which point I'll be at [inaudible] (ph) during the last three weeks.
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: Let's see — last three weeks of June.
CLIENT: And, [pauses] um, my last day in Hanover before that is the fourth. Is that...?
THERAPIST: OK, so that's a Monday.
CLIENT: So let me...that's a Monday. Um... [00:00:57]
THERAPIST: So we won't meet, then, from the sixth [pauses] through the, uh [pauses] — OK, up here. Mah! When do you get back?
CLIENT: Uh, July first.
THERAPIST: [Pauses] OK. All right, I'll just make a note on when you return. I won't bother trying to deal with all these 'cause that's [murmurs] do today.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: OK. [Pauses] OK, so then we would meet after that — uh, probably not on the fourth.
CLIENT: Oh. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Um, I guess we can just figure something else out for that week, or we could go for the next week or something.
CLIENT: Yeah, uh... [00:01:56]
THERAPIST: I thought you may — um, I know that you — but I, uh — [pauses] um, I did sort of a second insurance company that Mike cover stakes (ph). I don't know — you may want to ask your insurance company if you wanted to talk while you were away over Skype. That's fine with me.
CLIENT: The Internet situation there is supposed to be sort of...
THERAPIST: Oh, OK.
CLIENT: ...weird. But they see on that paper, there's one communal computer that has Ethernet that all the residents can use.
THERAPIST: OK. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: And then there's this one common area that has Wi-Fi.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I could see how neither of those would work out well for therapy.
CLIENT: Yeah. I'm [shrugs] — I was a little suspicious if they were um — like, "Yeah, we always have this one computer that works." Like, hmm, I don't know if that's what I [chuckles] [Wi-Fi stuff is for] (ph).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, so [pauses], yeah. I mean, I guess, in a sense, it is very private being off in the woods, but...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...I [don't think I'm supposed to have, like] (ph) — with those, maybe you get a private Internet access. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, but — yeah. [00:03:03]
THERAPIST: OK, then, we would meet, uh, next week and the following week.
CLIENT: Yeah, depending on how many weeks there are in June or whatever month - if it is May.
THERAPIST: May...
CLIENT: May. [Chuckles] [Slaps surface]
THERAPIST: ...Right.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Great. [Pauses] [Turning it off.] (ph)
CLIENT: I know. [Chuckles] Um, yeah, so that's — it is exciting. Although, I have a crazy a lot of stuff to do before then.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, one of which things is I'm applying for another place that has the deadline tonight.
THERAPIST: Oh?
CLIENT: But it is for next summer, to do things. They're like crazy in a jam.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, and — but I have deadlines for freelance stuff this week. It is like I turned one of them in on Tuesday, when she wanted me to get all of them in, but they needed more work than I think she realized. So I was proud of myself. I actually asked for an extension instead of [chuckles] sort of, you know... [00:04:13]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Meaning to slide under the radar, and got one so...
THERAPIST: Oh, good.
CLIENT: Yeah, so, I have until the end of the week to, um — to sort of be — being [inaudible at 00:43:04] in relation, I just said, I don't know — maybe you could take a quick look but don't spend too much time on the — like, the larger parts of the text; like, just look for missing information, but they need it to be rewritten.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, so... [chuckles]
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: Oh...so, yeah, it is — [the feeling of it all; it overwhelms] (ph). Um, but, this place, as I read, are then working out for today... [00:05:02]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: ...Feels kind of good in that, I feel like a lot of times — I remember my undergrad college applications and even my grad school applications...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Writing statements of purpose and things like that...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...And feeling really fake — like, "Oh, God, what do I say? Like, how do I craft something that sounds convincing?" And — and with this one, it just came totally naturally.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: Like — and I didn't do the most traditional thing for the first, like "Why does Tybee — like why does our organization and our location for a Tybee appeal to you? Instead of just trying to come up with some straightforward, sincere thing, I started out by totally just saying, "New England," and then talking about Elizabeth Bishop...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Yeah.
CLIENT: ...Who — this poet who could write...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, her, um, descriptions of Tybee from when she lived there.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh, mm-hmm. [00:05:56]
CLIENT: And, um, how she — I, like her, wanted to get away from the drab colors of the North and move to Tybee. Um, it was just fun to actually — having a special form to fill out, in which I could say things that I meant [slaps surface] and have fun with it. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yep.
CLIENT: Um, and the next section was you know, "What do you expect to get out of it?" And that was sort of — like, I tried to be more straightforward with that...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm,.
CLIENT: ...But I still felt like I meant it more than I often do, and it is a lot more [chuckles] — um, but that felt cool.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: Nice to know yourself.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah. [Pauses] Uh — and [pauses] — yeah, and, I guess, [slaps surface] up until at some point last night, the freelance stuff was going pretty steadily...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...Too. But I really just tired myself out. Um, [chuckles] my phone stopped working. [00:07:02]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Uh, I had been sick, um, the weekend.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Um, sort of, again, still a little bit fatigued...
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, sure.
CLIENT: ...From the [pauses] — um, but the weekend was actually kind of miserable. [Chuckles] [Sneezes]
THERAPIST: Just from being sick?
CLIENT: No, I went to the last girls' night out of the year, with those girls who are, like...
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: ...My roommate Sue...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...And girls in her year, and then Kimberly, Mike's girlfriend.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Um, and she's dating Mike, as — I've become part of that group, too. Um, and you know, when we first got there, I think there were five of us. And Katie is getting married, so, usually, the conversations are centered on her wedding plans, [chuckles] since none of the rest of us have any permanent life decisions going on, so... [00:08:03]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...It is sort of like the <i>Katie Show</i>. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Um, but she's been really negative. And she really stressed out, too, the single girls, so they'd left to go to another party. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Oh, wow.
CLIENT: But, you know, trying to hide the fact that it was because Katie was making them feel like shit 'cause they were single.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: Sounds kind of awful.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it was, like — it was subtle, but it was something that Katie should've picked up on. Like, [pauses] the — and [chuckles] so I was left alone with Katie and Kimberly, and then it just turned into hell because one thing Katie tends to talk about, for some reason, is that, um, she's not sure if she should have kids because she's so neurotic and deals with depression, and she just doesn't know if she wants to pass those issues onto children. And she is one of the most successful people in the whole Department, and she's ahead of everyone else in her cohort. I'm [inaudible at 00:38:23] the cohorts out of her in terms of progress on her dissertation.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: She has this fabulous story (ph) [slaps surface] at the Library coming up. Her advisors are just always thrilled with her progress. And she's volun — she finds time to volunteer with refugees. And, anyway, she genuinely cares about it; she's not some sort of annoying, like...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, and they want her to write a book about the refugees, and she's thinking of going to post grad school after she gets her Ph.D., and she's getting married, [chuckles]...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: You know, so if you could sort of...
THERAPIST: She's really good at making people feel like crap about themselves?
CLIENT: Yeah, and she totally - but — doesn't — she's not someone who wants to do that, but she's also not attuned to the fact that she's doing that and maybe doesn't care as much as she, perhaps, should. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:09:57]
CLIENT: Um, but I think it is frustrating for people because they know she's not a one-upper who tries to make them feel bad; she's just, like — is sort of focused on her own insecurities that she doesn't notice what other people are feeling, [chuckles] and what they logically would be feeling...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: ....Faced with her success compared to everyone else's struggles. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Right, got you.
CLIENT: Um, so other people don't call her out on it much because, you know, she doesn't mean it. But... [sighs]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: That doesn't change the fact.
CLIENT: No. Um, and, usually what she says doesn't get to me that much, probably because I'm not in her year, and that's having, you know, this little amount of dissertation progress to compare to hers. Um — and I don't really want to get married that badly right now. But [chuckles] — but — but then she started getting into stuff that really did get to me, um, 'cause her — she, like — for some reason I feel like every time I see her, she brings up this thing about maybe she shouldn't have kids. [Chuckles] Like, it just starts — comes to her teeth (ph) when hanging out with Katie. [00:11:13]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Um, and then Kimberly was "Yeah, you know, I'm not sure if I should have kids because I know my great-grandma was schizophrenic, and my grandma had some signs of some weird mental illness." And then she was like, "You know, my greatest fear in life is that I might start showing signs of <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>, and, if that happens, just shoot me, please. Like, I just..."
THERAPIST: Oh, God.
CLIENT: ..."Going to end it." And she's — for some reason Kimberly said that same phrase about five to seven times over the course of the next hour. Like, she just kept returning to it, and it — it just made me feel like shit because, I mean, the PTSD really mimics [chuckles] <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>. Um, and so I felt like she was saying, you know, like, "Your life experience isn't worth living," like, "People like you should just be shot." And she has no idea that, um, I'm going through things that are so delusional, I guess. But [pauses] uh, I don't know. I guess people feel like they can be really insensitive about mental illness. [00:12:27]
THERAPIST: Apparently.
CLIENT: And they don't — it is not like, you know, like fat shaming or something, where people feel a little worse.
THERAPIST: Right, right.
CLIENT: And maybe they still do it, but they, like — I don't know — it is like people have no awareness that that could be a sensitive topic. [Chuckles] Um, and they started obsessing about, "Oh, God, you know, we're all that age where the signs of <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia2"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia3" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> start showing." And sometimes, a [horror disserter] (ph) kicks in at this age," and I'm found (ph). Like, I just am always, um, scrutinizing my behavior and my mental patterns to see if anything might be going wrong. [Chuckles] And Kimberly was "Oh, my God, me, too." [Slaps surface] I'm just, "Yeah you guys — you poor things. Like, you who are not actually [chuckles] having serious issues." [00:13:21]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, and they just went on and one for an hour, and I got really quiet. Um, and I just kept hoping, "OK, they can't talk about this forever." [Chuckles] Like, "Surely, you all noticed I'm quiet and maybe change the subject." And maybe half an hour, and they turned to me and were like, "Oh we saw you're being really quiet. I hope we're not boring you," or, "We're freaking you out by talking about how crazy we are, like striking a nerve or something." And it is what do you say? I'm not going to say, "You're weird. You're boring. You're crazy, or you struck a nerve." Like... [chuckles] [00:14:04]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: None of those things is like an option to actually agree to.
THERAPIST: Right, right.
CLIENT: And so I just said something — I just tried to say something really — like, unconvincing "I don't know. I'm just tired," but without trying to sell it. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I was hoping that my unconvincingness would make them change the subject, but they didn't. [Chuckles] They just went right back into it for another half-hour.
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:14:29]
CLIENT: Um, and then Katie started talking about students that she and Mike have had, who had psychological issues, and describing one student's behavior and how he was having trouble getting his work in, but sending in, really, like [turning in everything by e-mails] (ph) about it, and how she thought he was probably like a sociopath. Um, and being you know, "One in every hundred people is a sociopath." Like, you know, "There's probably one at this bar, and we're all going to meet them in our lives. We're all probably going to have to, you know, have them in classes." And then — then she went on to talking about this other student who would turn in work that was clearly intelligent but just didn't — like, the sections didn't fit together; it was disordered, and how this student e-mailed her, saying you know, "I don't know what's wrong with me. Like, I can't get my thoughts in order. Like, this is really weird. I'm not sure what's happening." And — and she was you know, "It seems like he was probably headed toward a psychotic break." And — and then she was "You know," like, "this happens sometimes. In probably in all of our careers we'll all have at least one student who is going to have a psychotic break during our class." It is like, "Yeah, but you know, that's really fascinating until you actually kind of have one, [chuckles] then it is not such a sensational thing anymore." [00:16:02]
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: Um, and just I felt so bad for that student, when she was describing his e-mail. And she didn't seem to feel bad for him at all. He was just like an interesting case study in the things you experience as a professor, [slaps surface], TF, whatever.
THERAPIST: Yeah, right. This is like a — a sort of [pauses] fascinating, bizarre...
CLIENT: ...Curiosity.
THERAPIST: Curiosity, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. And when she told that story, I just got really sad, first for the student, just like hoping he got help somehow. And — and, also, just like — I had sort of considered confiding in Katie because, [pauses] um, both of her parents are psychiatrists, I think.
THERAPIST: Oh. [00:16:58]
CLIENT: Um, and her dad is a really famous, um, therapist who is — he's a tenured faculty position somewhere.
THERAPIST: What's the name?
CLIENT: Last name is [inaudible], and he's out West.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: Um, but [pauses] — yeah, I don't — I don't remember his first name. Um, so I sort of thought that, then, maybe she would have a more sort of sympathetic and normalized attitude toward different psychological issues...
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: ...Based on that connection, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
THERAPIST: Maybe not.
CLIENT: It is more like she thinks they're interesting and wants to sort of understand them in a very distant, logical way, like — you know, how they sort of relate to her — like, what she Mike experience in her life.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, namely like teaching students who have issues, I guess.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But not wanting to help them herself. [00:18:00]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Not that she could. I mean, obviously, that's not her...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...Expertise. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: But — so, it was sort of deciding...
THERAPIST: Like compassion and consideration go a long way...
CLIENT: Yeah, and not just like...
THERAPIST: ...From anybody — yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah it would have just felt better if she had expressed some desire to help, because being insensitive's just is a desire to turn them into stories to tell over cocktails. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah, if she'd said she felt really worried or really bad, or like — wished she could have done something.
CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, maybe she did and just, like — maybe she thought that was obvious and didn't feel the need to say it, but that was...
THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like it felt that way to you. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: No, [chuckles] I didn't get that vibe. Um, and I would — I just sort of was alarmed that I had actually considered telling her some of the things going on; I'm [chuckles] so glad I didn't. [00:19:10]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, and, I mean, after she told the story of the student, she had just started thinking — I just got sort of that, um [pauses] — and I had to try not to start crying as I sat there. And I really wanted to leave, but I felt like, um, if I'd left, it would seem like the last thing that had been said would seem like the last straw, and it connected somehow with the reason why I was upset. And I kept hoping they would start talking about shoes or something [chuckles] so I could leave then, but they didn't.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So there was nothing that I saw as sort of an exit, like a neutral topic.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:19:55]
CLIENT: Um, and, finally, they - half an hour later, were like, "Oh, you know, you're still so quiet." [Chuckles] It is like, "Oh, I just need to go to the bathroom," so I ran to the bathroom and started crying there. And I don't usually cry in public places. And I was crying like audibly, which, usually, I don't. Um, but I was able to, you know, pull myself [slaps surface] together and say goodbye to them, and then leave. But I was crying for the whole walk home, which is weird for me, because that's so public, and there are all these drunk people out on the street, um — and I was just more upset than I've been, you know, in a really long time. Um, and then I just cried for so many hours, and I — I just felt like I don't really want to, you know, socialize anymore, which is something I feel often but more passively or like a passing thought, but it doesn't have a lot of significance. Um, but I just really wanted to quit after that night. [Chuckles] Um, because I think I go — go out, as in, you know, in a group or whatever... [00:21:10]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Sort of infrequently that, whenever I do...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...There's some hope that it will prove that it is a thing worth doing.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But it generally doesn't, [chuckles] especially not that time.
THERAPIST: Yeah, well...
CLIENT: [Pauses] [sighs]
[Silence for 22 seconds]
THERAPIST: Um, [pauses for 8 seconds] — I imagine you were so upset, [pauses] um, because you felt so alienated by the way they were talking about mental illness? And also so [pauses] like, sad and frightened about what things have been like. [00:22:19]
CLIENT: Yeah. Um, I guess I always have higher expectations for literature students, which I'm learning I just shouldn't, [chuckles] um, because, you know, for one thing, they're supposed to be interested in understanding the experience of the way other people experience the world; that's one part of why we read. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And literature offers many examples of letters and characters who did suffer from different mental illnesses, and so I feel like it is a community in which that should be somewhat normalized, because the people we... [00:23:00]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: ...Spent all this time researching had these problems, so we probably shouldn't be so afraid of their problems [chuckles], maybe.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But, somehow, that doesn't seem to be the case. I feel like the actual art world is maybe the only place where that's really true.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] I think it is much more acceptable among visual artists, musicians, and experimental writers than scholars.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Um, at least judging from my time in the [liberal arts] (ph) 'cause it is going to be like the liberal/experimental side of the spectrum. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Right, right.
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] — uh, and so it was changed here to sort of interjections that kept coming up there that hour, like, "It is so scary." I was like, "Well, one of the authors you guys read has mental illness," like, "maybe you should have figured out how not to be so scared by this one." [Chuckles] [00:24:08]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like, even if that won't do it, what will; I don't know, probably nothing. Um...
THERAPIST: Well, [pauses for about 30 seconds] — hm, I — um [pauses for about 5 seconds] — I guess they were, uh, sort of [pauses] distancing themselves, [pauses] uh, from mental illness as much as they sort of - the content of what they were saying seemed to support - in the mid-direction (ph) — it sounded like the feeling is very much as though they were distancing themselves and [pauses] — uh, [sighs] being very pejorative. [00:25:58]
CLIENT: Yeah. And they were doing it in such a way that you couldn't very easily comment on it since the whole excuse for the conversation was that both of them were afraid that they would become more mentally ill or have mental illnesses show up because it is, like, that time of life. And so it is — it is always harder to criticize people when they seem to be working through their own anxieties.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But, um, [pauses] there was definitely a place at which I was thinking maybe I should just make some sarcastic comment, but it was harder for me to do that since the context of the conversation made them seem like they weren't unempathetic; they were just, you know, [shrugs] — I don't know — doing whatever they were doing. Plus, I didn't really want to be questioned, so that making a sarcastic comment seemed dangerous. [Chuckles] [00:27:03]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] it was just a really strange position to be in, in which it seemed like nothing I could say and nothing I could do would really make my situation better. [Pauses] And, you know, looking back, I probably could have come up with some excuse to leave right away or "Oh, my phone is vibrating. Oh, look at this text. I need to go." [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But it — that didn't occur to me at the time, so... [chuckles]
THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:27:54]
CLIENT: [Slaps surface] Um, [pauses] and — and when Kimberly kept saying over and over, "If I ever develop symptoms of <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia3"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span>, just kill me now," like, it got me back to a time when — you know, like last spring, I wasn't sure how bad it was going to get, um, and I was genuinely worried that the medicine might learn how to take over and speak through me or cause me directly to act instead of just like giving me migraines and dizzy spells, and sort of influencing. And — and, you know, at that point in my life, I really did have to think about, you know at what point will it seem too dangerous, and I'll be in danger of being buried alive, basically [chuckles] by this other entity. Um, and it is really scary to think about the "I" that is speaking losing control and being where...? [00:29:06]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Like somewhere just in the mind, like where the mechanism is now, just sort of like back there, always listening and watching but being unable to do? [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It is just, you know, I mean, the scariest thing ever. [Chuckles] Um, and — and since, you know, words (ph) and things, people said, clearly "You did a lot worse." I mean, it seems like every time I left the house or talked to anyone, I was sort of endangering my own life in a sense, um, by exposing myself to toxic influences that — that could get me buried alive, essentially.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:29:55]
CLIENT: Um, and hearing someone sort of take on that burden and question without earning it, and just being totally flippant and — they're melodramatic and self-aggrandizing all at the same time, [chuckles] like just obnoxious on so many levels.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I haven't sort of dealt with that question like, you know, at what point, uh, do I jump ship? [Chuckles] Um, you know, it is like — it just has such a terrible impact. Like, Kimberly doesn't the right to ask that question, [I mean, never had any substance to get this in the end] (ph), ever. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] [sighs] I don't know. [Sounds emotional, about to cry] [Pauses for 10 seconds] They made me feel sort of self-conscious for wanting to have kids, too, since they're both so anxious about it. [00:31:12]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I don't have any questions about it. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: No. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] I don't know. [Pauses] [Sighs] That just made it really unappealing to be back in that environment.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm,
CLIENT: Like I'm — people who I thought might somewhat understand...
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: And [hearing it hurts] (ph), to just like take on issues that aren't their own and use them as an excuse to be really dramatic is kind of insensitive. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
[00:32:00]
[Silence for 30 seconds]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Um, we have Group on Monday.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: As an experience as a whole, it was nicer. I think, after two weeks of good behavior, I felt the suspicion [chuckles] had lifted (ph) [chuckles]...
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: ...And everything felt normal again.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, but the topic on Monday was anger, and a lot of the women there seem to experience anger much more directly than I have. Um, one of them hates men, and that makes her job sort of difficult [chuckles] because she works at a coffee shop, and she'll get criticized for her customer service. [00:33:03]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And so not smiling enough...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: ...And not being nice enough, and so snapping at men when they hit on her.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And so she worries that keeping her job and — if she loses it, you know, getting another one...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...Um, since — like, she really doesn't [chuckles] want to smile at every man who walks into her coffee shop.
THERAPIST: Probably not. She maybe wants to punch them.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, and two women are teachers, and so they're constantly accountable to — not just like people who can sort of take care of themselves, but children who...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ....Tend to can't... [chuckles]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: ...And so that, you know, leaves them very vulnerable because they just always have to be receptive to the needs of others.
THERAPIST: I see, yeah. [00:33:58]
CLIENT: And they can't really express their anger at the children. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, and...
THERAPIST: Ah, so they can't sort of go off on their own or...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Uh, you know, tell some off-the-wall kid to hang on for five minutes, or whatever?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or get other students...
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, 'cause they don't have privacy.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And they not only like don't have privacy, but they have to be actively connected to a room full of people and watching all of them. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, and, you know, both of them experience anger very directly, and one of them will start, like — she has problems of starting to clean things. And the other one, I guess, deals with trying to find things to say that she feels like, you know, are appropriate to admonish the children... [00:35:00]
THERAPIST: [Clears throat]
CLIENT: ...I don't know - um, but then she tends to blow up at her fiancé at home. And, um, it seems like a lot of the people have dealt with sort of a desire to yell at people [chuckles], and, um, they have, like, a direct confrontations and stuff like that.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] and this is like the only meeting that I felt like my experience has sort of been most alien in a sense, um, because I feel like, uh, since I just sort of denied that there was a problem for so long, it just manifests as physical symptoms. And there are times when I get sort of really angry, more at society than at individuals, except for Mike, say...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...Directly, aligned (ph) himself with all that. [00:35:59]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] but [pauses] I guess I felt sort of jealous of the other women. Like, not that I think their problems are fun, like — obviously [chuckles]. Um, but it would be nice if I could have sort of had these things present themselves to me directly instead of showing up as migraines and dizzy spells, and mind scrambles.
THERAPIST: I see. Like, [clears throat] I'd rather have things like anger.
CLIENT: Yeah, well — and they — I've been very resistant to anger throughout my life because I remember being taught anger is just this like toxic emotion that is — it just poisons you, like...
THERAPIST: Oh. Did you parents tell you that? [00:37:03]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Um...
THERAPIST: Do I remember correctly that you got in trouble in preschool for being angry or stuff related to being angry?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And there was an incident when I could never sleep at naptime, so teacher tried to make me lie down on the mat and take a nap anyway, [slaps surface] and I just lost it and punched her in the face. There was another time when a little boy hit my female friend in the face with her own shoe, and I was shocked at the moment but I was so angry that, the next morning, I waited behind the bushes, and when he, like walked up to school with his mom, I jumped out and beat him up. And then I wrote a short story — or dictated — you know, we all had to dictate to our parents — about a man shooting a woman...
THERAPIST: That's right. [00:38:00]
CLIENT: ...At which point they thought I should have [chuckles] counseling. Um, [pauses] so — so I did get in trouble for anger management issues at a young age.
[Silence for 30 seconds]
[00:38:42]
THERAPIST: Um, [pauses for 10 seconds] I guess they did — uh — [pauses for 5 seconds] - I wonder if something that gets in the way of your being angry now involves what I think is your more basic reaction to a lot of things, but among them what's happened to you, which is, um, to just not want [pauses] contact with people. I mean, uh [sighs] [pauses] — and, uh, if being angry involves con — or angry as such involves contact with people, apparently, sometimes, [chuckles]... [00:40:03]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] ...Pretty direct contact with people — but even like your reaction to what happened the other night with Katie and Kimberly, uh, at least as you described it, you haven't mentioned feeling angry. You've been critical of them, certainly, but what you were more strenuously, during the conversation and — and your resolve afterwards, was to be out of touch, of course, stay away from people.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think I was — I was genuinely angry for a time during and for a few hours after, but then very quickly that other thing — reaction kicked in, where it was like, "Wow, they didn't know any better? It is unfortunate that they're so insensitive. I guess I just shouldn't see them," and sort of quickly replaced the anger... [00:41:18]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Which — and [there's another state] (ph), but [chuckles] it was very extreme. Um, but it was strange to be in such an extreme state for several hours and then have that replaced by this sort of calm dismissal, which it almost felt like this thick fog rolling in...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...And just neutralizing and covering that. And, now, I can't access it anymore; I can hardly even remember how it felt.
THERAPIST: That second state has certainly been much more evident as you've talked about it here today. [00:42:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, I never really felt angry at them since — I've been angry at them a bit the next day, but, like...
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: ...It was replaced pretty quickly with just thinking, like — you know the biblical line thing — "They know not what they do." [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Uh, that sort of attitude... [chuckles]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...Which is what pop psychology would certainly say was the right attitude. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: I mean, my mom would be like, "Oh, good, you've really handled this the right way." But what it feels...
THERAPIST: But, uh, [sighs] [pauses] — um, if I remember right, uh, [pauses] the guy who said that was on the verge of some pretty major self-sacrifice. [00:43:02]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah, I'm forgetting the context.
THERAPIST: Oh, isn't that where Jesus was crucified? "Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do."
CLIENT: Oh, [slaps surface] obvious — yeah. [Chuckles] [Slaps surface] I don't know how I got that out of context. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Even I know that one. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Wow. [Pauses] Hmm, it almost seems significant that I managed to get that out of its context [chuckles]...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Considering how much I've heard it in context.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: But Easter sermons for every year — for, uh, oh, 20 years. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: Hmm. [00:43:49]
THERAPIST: Um, [pauses for 20 seconds] I guess my point being, in forgiving them, you, I think, are making it — you're sacrificing, you know, a sense of what actually happened to you. The fog rolled in, and it is gone.
CLIENT: Yeah, and it is — it is strange because I definitely don't forgive people, like ever, but what I do isn't like — it is strange. It is just like more of a neutralization.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It is sort of like there is something active about forgiveness, in which you sort of accept something. I don't think I accept it or exonerate them in any way. [00:45:06]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But then, somehow I don't retain the anger, either.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] It is a weird middle ground.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I think here, as well, like the affect and then contact with me is, I suspect, worrisome.
[Silence for 20 seconds]
CLIENT: Mm, [pauses] in ways, there's a conflict between...
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:45:58]
CLIENT: ...Wanting a place that feels sort of like a safe space, in which the experience is somewhat predictable — predictable in a sense that I'm not going to be totally destroyed by the experience and, on the other hand, like wanting a context in which I really can actually change and confront things that are disturbing.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And, obviously there should be a balance between those two things, but sometimes I — you know, I wonder whether I err to side on — too much on the side of detachment and safety.
THERAPIST: Mm. [Pauses] Um, [pauses] yeah, I wonder about [pauses for 13 seconds] if you're aware about what would happen going more the other way, like what would become unpredictable or unsafe. We're don't have time to take it up now, unfortunately... [chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: ...Um, but I'm sure we will at some point.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] OK, so [becomes emotional, says weakly] I'll see you next week.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you, too. Take care.
CLIENT: You, too [emotional, breathless].
THERAPIST: OK.
[Door opens]
