<font size="5"><b>5: THE SIN EATER</b></font>
[p. <i>[197]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00210&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

EIGHT DOLLARS and ten cents an hour. That's what we,
a top notch team of psychologists and social workers, were
earning in the early 1980s at our world-famous children's hos
pital and community mental health center.


I had been simmering quietly over this for some time, never
reaching full boil until our director called a special meeting. Dr.
Claude Bradley wished to announce that our caseloads would
be increased by 20 percent, effective immediately. Were there
any questions?


I raised my hand.


"We're working twelve-hour days as it is, Claude. Some of us
are still in analysis and many have spouses and kids. I calculated
my hourly wage last night, and here is my comment: I can't believe
the amount of work I'm doing now for eight dollars an
hour, and I'm not dying to do more."


No one moved.


"When did <i>you</i> get a raise?" came a voice behind me.


That would be Jeff, the class clown.


Claude was sympathetic. He was a decent, overworked guy
who could have been making a mint in a different setting. He

[p. <i>198</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00211&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We had heard doomsday rumors for a year, but no one but
Claude believed them. Looking back, I see that even he could
not have imagined what lay ahead: a total dismantling of public
mental health services. There would be huge layoffs of staff
and, for the patients, a new world of crisis management usurping
the old ethic of prevention and care. Claude was a good
man, an able clinician, and someone who generally looked out
for us. He had, I thought, a special affection for me.


"To all of you, I want to say I'm sorry about this. And to
Luepnitz I would like to add: Cut the bellyaching."


There was more.


In recognition of our low salaries, the clinic would allow us
to see private patients and keep 70 percent of whatever fee we
wished to charge. If there weren't enough affluent clients to go
around, we could work evenings and weekends at the satellite
clinic in a wealthy suburb, fifteen miles away. This option was
obviously more appealing to people with automobiles.


For the administration, private practice was a magic bullet.
For this group of clinicians, it was a sell-out. Many of us had
been active in radical politics in college, and all were influenced
by the people-before-profits ethos of the sixties. Odd as it now
may appear, many of us found the idea of seeking monied patients
unseemly.


"I came here to work with people from my neighborhood,
Claude," I said pointedly. "Rich folks will always be able to find
the help they need."

[p. <i>199</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00212&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"This is the eighties, Deborah," he countered. "Are women
allowed to have good business sense yet?"


That was all Dr. Bradley chose to say.


I took off for the cafeteria, followed by Fran, my supervisor
of many years. Times were changing, she said. One could treat
rich and poor patients alike, no? One could be a force for social
change without wearing overalls and living like a hobbit, right?
It wasn't necessary to charge astronomical fees like some of
the downtown shrinks, she added. Charging even half the going
rate would make a huge difference. Just practice saying it,
she urged in only half-jest. "My fee is fifty dollars."


I was shocked to hear her pick up where the boss left off.
This was unpretentious Fran from Brooklyn, the anti-Yuppie,
she of the oversized blue sweater we occasionally threatened to
burn. And my favorite line, "Rich folks will always be able to
find the help they need...." Where did she think I got that in
the first place?


Fran and I agreed to disagree.


Later that spring, my west Philadelphia apartment building
was sold. The new landlord painted the lobby and doubled the
rent. I began to think differently about things, including what
my old mentor had said. Surely one hour of private service per
week couldn't hurt. I practiced: "Good evening. I am Dr. Luepnitz,
and my fee is fifty dollars."


I sashayed into the intake office one afternoon to request a
9:00 P.M. private patient. A teenager buying condoms would
have sounded more confident.


"Could I please have...let's see...someone <i>professional</i>, or
who...can afford, you know...."


Two weeks later, intake assigned me one "Ms. Green," age
twenty-five. Ms. Green had left a job she liked in Chicago to
follow her fiance to Philadelphia, but he had broken their

[p. <i>200</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00213&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The big night arrived. I wore my first-interview pantsuit
and wrapped a pretty scarf around my neck. It had been hot
and dry in Philadelphia for weeks, but on that July evening, the
skies opened, catching everyone by surprise. By nine o'clock,
people were entering the building soaked.


"There is a very drenched patient here to see you," said the
temp who was answering phones.


I went out to greet Ms. Green, a tiny woman with a broken
umbrella. She was only four feet eleven inches tall, and her jeans
and sweatshirt made her look younger than her age. Her blonde
shoulder length hair was plastered behind slightly prominent ears.
The wind had played rummy with her parcels, so that she looked
more like a homeless person than like a center city professional.


She was well spoken and engaging, pausing occasionally to
ask if she were going too fast, or to offer me a cigarette. Her
mouth quivered as she began to speak of Enrique, the man
who had left her. So fresh was the betrayal that she had not had
time to drain the tenderness from her voice when she said his
name. She bowed her head as Catholics do at the name of Jesus.
<i>Enrique</i>.


Then she mentioned her daughter, lnez, whom I did not re
member from the intake sheet.


I allowed her to continue, even as I realized that, not only
was she not a high salaried professional, she was one of the
most down-and-out patients I had ever seen. She was, for ex
ample, homeless.


"I have an address, but not my own home; let's put it that way."


On the form, she had written the street number, but not the
name of the shelter where she was living. She assured me that

[p. <i>201</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00214&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Margie at the shelter gave me your name."


Margie was a Penn student volunteering at the shelter. Apparently,
she had heard me give a talk on the importance of
providing long-term insight-oriented psychotherapy to everyone
who needed it, including low-income people. My argument
was that only the sheerest prejudice made therapists believe
that the poor had no unconscious conflicts, or that money
made human beings more reflective. Margie had taken a liking
to Ms. Green, and wrote down the clinic's phone number, suggesting
she ask for "Deborah or Fran."


"<i>Margie said this place was terrific. She said you stick with people and
help them get their lives together. She said you let whole families live here to
work on their problems</i>."


"Ms. Green, did our office mention the fee?"


"Yes. She said that people who can't pay or have medical assistance
are put on a waiting list in a different department. But
I told her ‘no problem’ because I can pay."


"You <i>can?</i>"


"I worked last week. Thank you for not looking shocked.
You know that a lot of homeless people have full-time jobs,
don't you?"


Actually, I didn't. I learned only later that 20 percent work full
time—that employment is no guarantee against homelessness.


"I got paid tonight. What will this cost all together?"


My tutoring kicked in, on cue. Sounding more like I had been
abducted by aliens than not, I said, "My fee is fifty dollars."

[p. <i>202</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00215&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"That's perfect!" she said. "They told me to count on a year
or so of treatment, right? That's about a dollar a week. So here
you go."


She plastered a damp dollar bill on the round table between
us, and ironed it a few times with one tiny hand.


Surely this was happening to someone else.


"What do your patients call you?"


I wanted to say, "Fran."


"If I call you Dr. <i>Loo</i>-pen-itz, it takes too long and I won't
call you anything. Using your first name would be too much
like friends. What if I call you ‘Dr. L’? Would that work? And
please don't call me ‘Ms. Green.’ Use my first name."


I was struck with how seriously she was taking our relationship.
Her first name was a name that connotes sadness. I will
call her "Emily."


Formalities concluded, Emily asked if she might plunge in
and talk about what had recently happened to her.


What had happened was that her heart and soul were cleaved
in two by the only man who ever loved her. She had previous
boyfriends in her life, but each one had mistreated her. One had
beaten her with a hammer. Another stole her camera—the last
thing she owned that belonged to her mother.


Enrique Marron, in contrast, was wonderful. Other men had
called her "half-pint" and "Thumbelina." Enrique called her his
"china doll." He taught her how to fix cars. He also helped her
get the best job she had ever had, working for the post office.
Enrique had already discovered that since the main branch was
open twenty-four hours a day and was equipped with lockers
and showers, living at work was a practical solution to tough
times. Before they were lovers, they were friends and roommates
of sorts at the P.O.


Enrique, unfortunately, had a habit. Actually two habits:
liquor and cocaine. Emily was clean, and had enough money to

[p. <i>203</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00216&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emily had lost every bit of family she had by the age of sixteen.
She had been hungry, battered, and neglected. Enrique
was the proof that all could still be well. He said they would be
married when he returned. just around the corner, she saw a
happy family, a special bliss.


Between choking sobs, she told me the final chapter. Enrique
had been away too long. He phoned one night and said
there was trouble; he would send for her when it got straightened
out. She was afraid for him, and spent half the money she
had on earth buying a bus ticket to Philadelphia. She was
greeted at the door by his wife, the mother of his four other
children. This woman began screaming in Spanish before bolting
away from Emily and returning with an obviously loaded
revolver. Enrique wrested the gun from her and pushed Emily
out at the same time. He said he was the father only of the four
children she had just seen. They were being evicted, and he was
taking them back to the Dominican Republic.


Emily had hyperventilated for an hour. If not for Inez,
shaking in her arms, she would have run in front of the nearest
truck. She had no interest in the fresh hell that would be her
life henceforward. Her lover was gone; her child had no father.
They would never see him again.


Mother and daughter spent the night in the bus station at
Eleventh and Filbert, where they ate crackers out of the vending
machine and slept curled together on a plastic chair. When
Emily awakened, her wallet was gone.


"Ripped off! In the city of brotherly fucking love!" It was an
abject story, and I realized I was hearing just the outlines. She
wanted me to know that Inez had been a happy child, but was

[p. <i>204</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00217&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I need help being a good mom; I need help with a lot of
things, but the first is falling out of love with Enrique. My father
left when I was seven; my mom was a saint, but she died
when I was ten, and my grandmother died sleeping next to me.
Still, nothing hurt like this hurts. I hate to tell you this. I'm
ashamed. But I was pushing that woman's arm—his wife's
arm—because I wanted the gun to go off. I wanted her to kill
me. Do you think I'm evil to think for a second of abandoning
my kid? I'm not that bad. I need to hear from you. I need to
know what you think of me."


I told her what I was thinking: that she had survived more
pain in a few decades than many people did in a lifetime. I
couldn't help commenting on her strength.


"People have called me a lot of things in my life, but not
‘strong.’ Thank you for....Look. I would like to promise you
something, OK? Help <i>me</i>, and I will take care of <i>her</i>," she said,
pointing to the empty chair beside her. "Will you do that?"


Almost without thinking, I said I would. Of course.


I suggested Emily bring Inez to our next meeting, and she
seemed relieved. Then she added, "Write down the time of the
appointment, please. We'll be here unless I decide I can't stand
this hick town another day. If you don't see me, you'll know
we've headed out."


She stood up.


As I watched her fold her appointment card in two and use
it as an ashtray, I wondered if I would ever see her again. It
would have made life easier if she had hopped a bus back to

[p. <i>205</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00218&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And so it came about that I agreed to do my best for her, for
Emily. The name came to me that very night, and I know why.
Emily is the name of the girl left on a woman's doorstep in a
novel I had just read, Doris Lessing's <i>Memoirs of a Survivor</i>. The
story is set in a vague postnuclear winter, in which daily existence
consists of hunting down provisions and uncontami
nated water. Gangs of adolescent boys roam the streets,
preying on survivors. An unidentified man with a female child
comes to the door of the narrator and says, before vanishing,
"She is yours. You must take care of her."


I don't remember leaving the clinic that night and walking to
the Chinese restaurant down the street. Nor do I remember ordering
a large plate of something and eating every bit. I know
that these things took place, because I recall seeing an empty
dish and feeling too stuffed to open my fortune cookie. I was
lost in thought about the failure of my first foray into private
enterprise.


Emily was by no means the sickest or most helpless patient I
had ever seen. On the inpatient service, I regularly dealt with
children who had been beaten, burned, left on agency steps, or
otherwise savaged by parents who had experienced the same
or worse as children. The reason I felt dazed was that I had had
a different kind of patient in mind. How to account for this
reversal of fortune? Doris Lessing's protagonist takes in young
Emily because she has no choice. I had a choice. I could have
explained the confusion and escorted her to the other side of
the building and never seen her again. Obviously, I was not
ready to do it, to become a woman of business, a lady of the
eighties. I would do that, or something like it, in time. At the.
moment, my loyalties lay elsewhere. I considered the possibility

[p. <i>206</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00219&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emily did show up for her next appointment. And the next.
We had as few as one weekly contact, and as many as nine, for
the following fourteen years.


Emily and four year old Inez came on time for our next session.
Because the little girl was tall for her age, and Emily so
short, they gave the impression of being the same size. Emily
wore black leggings and a baggy black top that nonetheless revealed
a bosom much larger than the rest of her. Her eyes were
the color of blue topaz, almost gaudy next to her skim-milk
complexion.


Inez was the photographic negative of her mother. She had
dark skin and huge black eyes that seemed by turns startled and
vacant. She wore Tommy Hilfiger sweats and little Reebok running
shoes. A rumpled white bow tied up her tired pony-tail.
She sucked her thumb, rubbed her belly, and stared ahead as
her mother spoke. Whenever Emily cried, Inez cried. Inez had
a bad cold and possibly conjunctivitis as well. Emily wanted
desperately for her to see a doctor, but she could not apply for
medical assistance without identification, and could not send
for her birth certificate without a permanent address.


My first intervention turned out to be as helpful as anything
I would do in the first two years. I decided to continue to see
Emily alone, so that she would not have to share me with Inez.
I referred them as mother-and-daughter to a group run by a
senior therapist and her two residents. For a two-hour period

[p. <i>207</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00220&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the meantime, Emily made it clear that she intended to
take her individual therapy seriously. Sometimes too seriously. I
don't mind being called at home when a patient is in crisis.
Emily was in constant crisis.


<i>Monday:</i> I have to at least try to see Enrique one more
time. Should I take Inez with me?


<i>Tuesday:</i> Someone traded me two Libriums for a cigarette.
The first one relaxed me, but now I'm sick.


<i>Wednesday:</i> If you thought Inez would be better off in
foster care, would you tell me?


<i>Thursday:</i> I cannot take the exhaustion of walking
around with her all day. I just want to die.


During this first month of treatment, I realized that in order
to work with Emily, I would have to take good care of myself.
I decided to line up an extra hour of supervision per
week. I phoned Grace Strauss, a woman outside our department
with whom I had worked as a student a few years earlier.
Emily signed a release allowing me to discuss our work with
my former teacher.


Grace was a woman of fifty, a salty, take-no-prisoners variation
on the earth-mother archetype. She had just a handful of

[p. <i>208</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00221&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Grace listened to me describe my accidental patient and
laughed her good, horsy laugh.


"Let's see: This Emily is homeless at the moment. She was
orphaned by age twelve, has a four-year old daughter in distress,
and was recently dumped by the man she loves. She was
robbed of her cash and identification, has no relatives on
earth, no friends in town, a therapist who hasn't had a real vacation
since high school, and a supervisor recovering from
cancer. This is a train wreck, Deborah."


Even from her hospital bed, Grace had done therapy and
supervision. It was more than obvious that she would outlive
us all.


"Say yes, Grace."


She said yes. Her supervision fee was fifty dollars. She would
charge me twenty-five.


"That would be an hourly, not an annual fee, Deb."


"Very <i>not</i> funny, Grace."


She listened a bit more and said, "With patients like this, I
think in terms of decades, not years."


Remarkably, this appalling news brought relief. Grace had
the experience of going the distance with a lot of people
whose lives were shattered early on. If I were willing to put in
the time, we could all more than survive this experience.

[p. <i>209</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00222&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I think therapy is a great thing, if I understand the rules
right. I mean, I get to keep talking about myself, and I can
count on you to listen, right?


"That's right."


"And even if you've had a tough day, and I have nothing fascinating
to say, you listen anyway."


"Of course."


"You don't talk about your own problems, you still pay at
tention to me."


"Ri...ight."


"I like it."


"Yes?"


"It's like being a <i>guy</i> on a <i>date!</i>"


Who wouldn't want to listen to Emily?


Enrique had finally left the country, but she was still thinking
about him, night and day. She imagined taking a plane to the
D.R. and pleading with him to acknowledge his daughter. Occasionally,
she thought about throwing acid in his wife's face.


Before Enrique, before her years of loss and bad luck, she
herself had been a happy child, she said. Her parents, would-be
artists, were eighteen years old when they decided to have her.
Immature, they were rebelling against their parents, especially
his father, who was a marine. They lived in a fifth-floor walk
up and took turns waiting tables, doing their art, buying drugs,
and caring for Emily. They smoked a lot of pot, and her father
turned to methamphetamines in his twenties, and then to
heroin. Her mother was lively and affectionate. Emily remembered
the two of them playing dolls together for hours. She

[p. <i>210</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00223&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The problems started when she was five. Her mother would
get depressed and not leave her bed for days. Emily remembered
crying in class in first grade, worrying about her mother
at home. There were scenes of the parents hitting each other.
And then her father moved out when she was seven. Her
mother, who had suffered for two years from a severe case of
mononucleosis, went to the hospital for several days of tests.
Emily was shipped off to her paternal grandmother's for a
week. She never saw her mother again.


"How exactly did she die?"


"Heart failure. She wasn't a junkie like my dad, but she had
done a ton of drugs by then, and she was in terrible shape."


Emily's grandmother hoped that the mother's death would
bring her son back to raise Emily. It did not. He was killed in a
motorcycle accident when Emily was twelve.


Fortunately, her grandmother was willing to keep her, and
fortunately, they got along well enough.


"You remind me of Gram," said Emily. "She was dark like
you, and she loved a good laugh. She was Italian; I bet you are,
too. Anyhow, she was calm and stable, different from my mom.
I was no trouble until I was fourteen. Then she sent me to a
shrink, who told her I had a borderline personality disorder."


At fourteen, Emily began writing on her arms and legs with
a razor blade. It was for attention, she said.


"I had gotten really fat that year, and I was generally miserable.
Twenty pounds on me looks like forty on someone else. I
think I cut myself because I hated being a fat kid."


Emily was working well in therapy, and in the mothers'
group as well. Inez had seen a physician who volunteered at the
shelter; she was eating again and playing with the other kids.

[p. <i>211</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00224&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Monday:</i> I think I have body lice. You better check
yourself, because I was sitting on your couch and hugging
your pillow this morning.


<i>Tuesday:</i> I had a nightmare that the woman next to us
stabbed Inez. Can I tell you my dream?


<i>Wednesday:</i> A woman from the mothers' group wants
me to move in with her. Is this a good idea?


In the group, Emily had met Nesta, an Iranian woman with
a daughter Inez's age. They had sought shelter from her abusive
husband, a physician, and would be out as soon as a lawyer
could help reclaim her bank account. She could afford to rent
an apartment, but was afraid to live alone. Nesta liked Emily
and said in group that Emily had "a beautiful soul." The mothers
in the group loved the idea of their working things out together.
If Nesta could earn good money at her teaching job,
Emily could stay home with the girls, solving the childcare
problem.


Emily had reservations about Nesta's religious convictions.
She didn't like her views on alcohol, drugs, or homosexuality,
either. However, Emily also realized that getting an apartment
together would be the best thing for both of them and their
daughters. Within days they had found a place.


I imagined that being in a safer environment would cut
down on her calls to me. It did not. In fact, on two occasions
she showed up, unannounced, in crisis. Both surprise visits
happened to be in the evening, as I was leaving the clinic for a
date. I felt I had no choice but to spend a little time with her.
She was impulsive and at risk of hurting either herself or Inez.

[p. <i>212</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00225&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Friday: Inez</i> won't eat anything except M&amp;Ms.; Should I
let. this go, or force her to eat? I really need some help
with this.


<i>Saturday:</i> You didn't call me back last night, and I'm a
little worried. Maybe you went away for the weekend. Just
call when you get back, OK?


<i>Saturday:</i> I'm starting to get more worried, because I
don't think you would have left town without someone
covering for you. If you get this, please call me, OK?


<i>Saturday:</i> Um, this is getting pretty damned frustrating,
because your line was just busy. Look, if you're fed up
and you don't want to see me any more, just tell me, and
I'll fuck off.


Grace had a recommendation.


"I hate to say it, Deborah, because I know you're swamped,
but Emily needs more than one session per week. She's asking
you in the only way she knows how. This is not a person to
whom you can say, ‘I'm still here, I haven't forgotten you.’ You
need to show it She'd be an idiot to trust you now, and Emily
ain't dumb. What are you thinking?"


"That I want to run away from home."


"I've been there. ..."


"This is, in part, how Emily feels every day. She does this
unconsciously so I will get a real clue about how she goes
through life," I said.

[p. <i>213</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00226&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You are terrific to take her on, Deborah. Neither you nor I
like diagnostic labels much, but you can see why somebody
called her ‘borderline’ at fourteen. You know the joke, right?
‘How do you treat a borderline? Refer ’em!’"


Of all the disliked diagnostic labels, the term "borderline
personality" particularly rankles. "Borderline" has a slippery,
euphemistic feel to it. Many young women who carry that diagnosis
have said they would rather be called "a just plain nutcase"
or "a loony-tune." Emily was later to tell me herself that
she disliked the label intensely, and asked me to explain it.


Vats of ink have been spilled on the subject of this diagnosis.
Does it refer to a real condition? If so, is it treatable? What
can be said about the etiology and prognosis?


"Borderline" is a term clinicians use to describe people who,
psychologically, are somewhere between normal/neurotic and
psychotic. Neurotics—that is, most of us—have our conflicts
and symptoms, but we manage to function in work and love,
for better and for worse, most of the time. Psychotics typically
don't function at all in work or love. To be psychotic is largely
to relate only to parts of the self—or to the world as an extension
of oneself.


People labeled "borderline" function in the world, but their
relationship to it and to others is severely impaired. They tend
to be self-destructive and impulsive. Emily's history of self-mutilation,
and her decision months back to spend her last dollar
on a one way ticket to see a man who was doing his best to
elude her, would be considered typically "borderline" behaviors.
The cause of this condition is considered to be severe
damage in the early parent-child relationship. The key word associated
with "neurotic" is "conflict"; with "borderline," it is
"deficit." That is, while neurotics face difficulties in reconciling
the demands of self with those of others, the "borderline" is

The following was true: Emily was impulsive and had been
deprived of the conditions conducive to forming a sturdy
sense of self. Her ability to form a therapeutic alliance remained
to be seen. She had been rejected and abandoned, yes,
but she had also had certain good-enough experiences with her
mother and especially with her paternal grandmother. Could
we build on these? Would she be able to stay the course if I
were willing to manage whatever came up?


Most of the time I felt I could handle my feelings for Emily,
but there were times I returned her attacks with sarcasm. On
one of the many occasions Emily undertook to tell me how
little I was doing for her, she floated the idea that her time
could be better spent at a gym or diet center. Instead of interpreting
her comment as a question about my commitment to
her, I snapped: "When you're afraid you might hurt Inez, can
you call Weight Watchers?" I was ashamed.


Grace assured me she had said dumber things to patients,
and recommended we reread Winnicott's classic paper "Hate
in the Countertransference."


Winnicott is famous for defining the good enough mother
as "one capable of having a straightforward love-hate relation
ship with her infant." He conceived of what we might call the
good-enough therapist in much the same way.

[p. <i>215</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00228&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Straightforward," clearly, is the operative term in the definition.
It points to the importance of acknowledging feelings,
not disclaiming or disavowing them. A mother who hates her
infant or who hates being a mother but cannot bear to have
this feeling may do any number of destructive things to conceal
it, such as having more children to punish herself, discouraging
all expression of emotion in those around her, or
attempting suicide. The therapist who is unable to bear the
combination of love and hate experienced for a particular patient
remains vulnerable to an array of harmful behaviors, such
as forgetting appointments or showing up late until the patient
drops out, gratifying each and every demand to cover up the
hate, or acting it out through angry comments. Winnicott
maintained that mothers (and by analogy, therapists) who
could accept their ambivalence as inevitable were far less likely
to do harm than the deniers.


Grace conjectured that the therapist who had seen Emily at
fourteen and lost her after three sessions could not manage his
hatred for Emily's petulant, angry, possibly borderline teen-age
self.


The holding environment that Grace (and indirectly, Winnicott)
provided for me at this juncture allowed me to do the
same for my patient. I felt a renewed warmth and curiosity
about Emily, who jumped at the chance to schedule more appointments
(at the ongoing rate of one dollar per session).
This did eliminate unannounced visits, as well as decrease the
number of crisis phone calls.


It was when we began seeing each other twice a week that
Emily told me some of the most wrenching details of her
story. As a girl, she had dreamed of attending college and becoming
a teacher. Everything fell apart when her grandmother
died. During tenth grade, Emily and Gram had made a habit of

[p. <i>216</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00229&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally—it could have been ten minutes or two hours
later—she leaned over and mechanically picked up the blue receiver
and dialed 911.


"My sweet Gram died peacefully of a burst aneurysm. At
least she didn't suffer. It was the perfect way to die—from her
point of view. But I don't think you can imagine how shitty I
felt. How scared. I was completely alone in the world; not one
human being cared about me. I closed my eyes and tried to
space out and not breathe, just in case it could happen that
God would take me, too. That was the last time I prayed. There
is no God, Dr. Luepnitz. If there was a God, I would have died
then and there."


After the funeral, the parents of a school chum insisted on
taking Emily in. She was welcomed as part of the family and
was able to stay in school. But she was not part of the family;
this she felt all too keenly. They made the right noises, but she
could not test limits and know, as other kids do, that she would
still be loved. She wasn't loved. She was a charity case.


"I started to steal stuff from them and stay out all night to
prove they didn't really want me. They had no choice but
to boot me."


This family spoke about Emily to the local minister, who
then met with her and offered to take her in. He was a young
man and told people to call him "Greg."

[p. <i>217</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00230&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"He helped me with my homework, but he treated me more
and more as a friend. He would say, ‘Let's watch this educational
program on television in our pajamas.’"


A ritual soon began of snuggling in front of the television,
which led to his having her masturbate him.


"It was nice at first. He was handsome and smelled good. I
thought it was amazing he could even stand me, given all the
stuff I had done to the Jones family. Later, I just wanted to
puke, but I couldn't say anything. My uncle had tried something
with me, and I walked away. But with Greg ... where
would I go if I ran away?"


There was no one to tell. She was sure the police wouldn't
have given her the time of day. She attempted several times to
run away, so Reverend Greg had no choice but to call Social
Services. Emily spent the last year of high school in foster
homes.


Foster care is often the final step before homelessness. This
is not because caring, competent foster parents don't exist; it's
because many overburdened families take in children only because
they need money. Too, young people know that when
they are sent to foster care they have hit the bottom rung on
the ladder, and they begin acting accordingly.


Emily was determined to finish high school, but she made
life miserable for as many foster parents as she could before it
was over. One evening, when a foster mom called her "lazy,"
Emily spent the entire night in an unlocked car, and got what
she called her "first taste of freedom." The summer after graduation
was particularly warm, and she slept under the stars in
the park. No more foster mothers or pointy-headed social
workers, no more creepy uncles or masturbating ministers. It
was just Emily and her new street-friends bumming change by
day and sharing provisions by night in Chicago's Hyde Park.
She spoke of it with nostalgia.

[p. <i>218</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00231&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"It's horrible to be homeless when you have a child. But that
time back in Chicago on my own was good. You could spend
your day in the library or in those bookstores that have little
restaurants in them, where someone has always left behind half
a French-bread sandwich or a piece of carrot cake. When they
closed, and it got cold outside, you would go in and sleep in a
shelter. When the crazy fucks and the boosters made you nuts,
you went back outside and enjoyed your freedom until you
started to freeze. It may sound crazy, but there is a rhythm of
the streets. Do you get what I'm saying?"


<i>Porcupine life. The real thing</i>.


I had named her after a fictional character, left on a woman's
doorstep. But now my patient reminded me of another Emily,
the one who wrote: "The Soul selects Her own Society. ..."


That Emily, the "Belle of Amherst," also wrote:


<i>I am alive</i>—<i>because</i>


<i>I do not own a House</i>—


<i>Entitled to myself</i>—<i>precise</i>


<i>And fitting no one else</i>—


Emily Green's love of freedom helped me understand the
next phase of her life with Nesta and their daughters. Their
apartment, located in a safe neighborhood, was warm and well-equipped.
Nesta was generous and companionable. Emily was
not ungrateful.


"It's better," she said laconically. "I can't say it's nirvana."
Emily had had enough on her hands with one four-year-old
in her charge. Two was more than twice the trouble. She called
me more often now, and not only because she possessed her
own phone.

[p. <i>219</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00232&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Monday:</i> Razi swallowed some powder that might be
detergent or poison or anything, and the writing on the
box is in Farsi. I can't get her mother on the phone. What
should I do?


<i>Tuesday:</i> God forgive me. I smacked Inez today, and it
felt so good I didn't want to stop. I locked myself in the
bathroom so I wouldn't kill her. I need to talk to you.


<i>Wednesday:</i> Thank you for talking to me yesterday. I'm
calm today. But you said something I didn't quite understand,
and I can't remember what it is. Will you call me
back today?


<i>Wednesday:</i> Never mind, don't call. I'll just handle this
myself.


<i>Thursday:</i> Thank you so much for calling back yesterday.
I'm sorry I screamed at you. I want to run away. Can't
you give me some medication? I would like to talk to you
today about this, if possible.


The truth is that there were no effective antidepressants on the
market at that time. Her physician prescribed a low dose of Valium,
which seemed to take the edge off her most brutal moods.


I wasn't hating her at this point, but I was extremely disillusioned.
I had assumed that sharing an apartment would help
her immensely. Instead, she was more depressed and irritable
than before. Staying home all day was a stark contrast to street
life. If she had once been too much on the move, she was now
unbearably sedentary. With two screaming kids, it was impossible
to read or talk on the phone. She found herself watching
television and snacking.


The high point of her day was watching reruns of Rod Serling's
<i>Night Gallery</i>. On one occasion she left a phone message

[p. <i>220</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00233&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As often as Emily longed to run away, her greatest fear was
losing her daughter. Grace and I had discussed this from the
beginning. No one would have been shocked if she had ended
up bruising one of the kids. Knowing her own potential, how
ever, she was determined always to call me before she lost con
trol. To have placed Inez in foster care preventively would have
been the more violent alternative.


"You're disappointed that her situation has not brought
more relief," Grace counseled. "It's obvious you've never been
a housewife, Deb. It has driven many a woman nuts." Rates of
depression, smoking, and obesity are higher for housewives
than for women who do not stay home, Grace pointed out. I
learned later that many homeless women who decide to get off
the street gain twenty to twenty five pounds during their first
year in residence. Grace predicted things would improve when
the girls started school. This turned out to be true.


It was during first grade that Inez began asking about her fa
ther. This caused Emily a lot of pain. She had stopped loving
Enrique, but she had not yet stopped hating him. What should
she tell her daughter?


I invited them to talk together in my office.


<i>Inez:</i> "Why can't we see or call him?"


<i>Emily:</i> "His wife doesn't want us to. You see, he hadn't
really told her about us. They had been separated a
long time, but then they decided to get back together."


<i>Inez:</i> "Is she a witch or something, Mom?"



[p. <i>221</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00234&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Inez</i> "Will we get a new daddy?"


<i>Emily:</i> "I don't know. The important thing is that we're a
family. I will always love you. That's forever. And
Nesta and Razi love you, too."


I spent a lot of time feeling exasperated with Emily. Occasionally,
I was dazzled by her constancy and clarity. I watched
Emily and Inez cuddle and talk, and I imagined wonderful
things for this mother and daughter.


"Emily, I was just thinking what a lucky mom you are to
have Inez for a daughter. She's so smart. She asked those questions
in a lovely way. Is it OK for her to ask you again some
time if she needs to?"


"Inez can ask me anything anytime. And she knows I like to
talk, talk, talk."


"Inez, how are you feeling now?"


"Good."


"You're a lucky girl to have this mom."


"Do we get a gold star for being a great team or what?"


"You do! I'm proud to know you."


And the truth is, I was.


With both children in school, Emily went to work at a diner.
There she met Jimmy, a good looking Vietnam veteran. She
was thrilled when he flirted with her, and chastened when he

[p. <i>222</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00235&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emily had gained twelve pounds as a "housewife," and when
she began to diet, she gained eight more. She had struggled with
her weight in high school, nearly always feeling unattractive, out
of proportion, even freakish. The day Jimmy spoke to her, she
went into "high diet gear." She brought home meatloaf and potatoes
for Nesta and the kids, and sat at the table eating an
orange. Her mood waxed euphoric as she watched her body
shrink. People started describing her as "delicate" and "waiflike."
It was hard to get my mind around it: a former street person
struggling to look like a waif to attract a man.


"It's a good rule of thumb, Deb, that no sector of the populace
is any less crazy than the rest," said Grace.


I understood this, and appreciated Emily's resolve, even as I
challenged her starvation diet.


"Women are crazy to do this, of course!" Emily agreed.
"But I am grateful to Jimmy, because he is my motivation."


Jimmy did something for her that I would be unable to do:
put her on a diet and crack the whip. This undoubtedly spoke
to her longing to be disciplined by a caring father or mother.
Some therapists try (and generally fail) to motivate an end to
their patients' compulsive eating. Others, sensitive to the inordinate
emphasis on thinness placed on women by the culture,
back away from weight issues altogether. What psychotherapy
can and ought to do is to keep in motion a conversation about
symptomatic eating: its origins, its ups and downs, its overt and
hidden satisfactions.


Emily agreed to talk about eating. She could identify the
month and the year when she started dieting. It started with a
group of girlfriends who would dare each other to starve all

[p. <i>223</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00236&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We worked on eating and body image for several months,
during which Emily reported a recurring nightmare. She was
on her way somewhere—sometimes to school, sometimes to
work or to my office—and she had to walk across "some disgusting
thing." The substance could be dirt, feces, vomit, or
some combination of the three, but it always assumed a square
or rectangular shape, "like a mat." She had no associations at
first. Mine ran along the lines of her former homelessness and
the squalid places she had slept. The word "mat" occurred
with increasing frequency until I finally asked her to say everything
she could about "mat." The word meant nothing in particular,
she said. It was just an ordinary object. Except that it
was the name of her father's brother. This man—an alcoholic
and ne'er-do-well who lived on and off with Emily's grandmother
—had groped her a couple of times when she was in
high school. Emily tossed it off, contrasting it with what the
minister had done. After all, Matt had only grabbed her breasts
a couple of times and stuck his hands down her pants. When
she told him to cut it out, he did. Consciously, it was no big
deal. He had neither threatened nor pursued her, and she did
not lose a friend in the process.


Nonetheless, he was her uncle, and she a fatherless child.


"Can you tell me more about this man and your feelings
about him?" I asked.


She remembered being curious about him at first, wondering
if he could tell her things about her father, even hoping he
might take an interest in her. But he seemed to regard her only
as a nuisance, blocking his view of the television, and always
eating.

[p. <i>224</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00237&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"He called me the little blimp, and stuff like that. I think I
was surprised he wanted to lay a hand on me."


That turned out. to be the year her weight shot out of con
trol. She ate whole loaves of sliced bread and cans of chocolate
frosting. Her grandmother saw her bursting out of her
clothes and had a fit. After Gram outlawed bingeing, Emily
started cutting her arms and legs with a razor.


Emily had always believed she became depressed because
she was fat. She had never seen it the other way around: that
she got fat because she was depressed. And she had never
linked this behavior to the "disgusting Matt." Consciously,
Emily considered their interactions insignificant. Her dream
life suggested otherwise. There was still a mess at her feet,
blocking access to any number of desirable things: education,
earning a living, getting help.


I asked if she had told her grandmother about Matt. Emily
reminded me that the incident occurred in the 1960s, before
people openly discussed such topics. There was no <i>Oprah</i>.
There was no teaching kids about "good and bad touch."


"Again, this may sound weird to you, but I would not have
known how to tell Gram, even if I wanted to. It was like there
were no words to say it, believe it or not."


I believed it! I had spent seven years getting a Ph.D. in clini
cal psychology without hearing the phrase "sexual abuse" or
the word "incest." Research has since shown that approximately
one girl in six has unwanted sexual contact with an adult
before she turns eighteen. This pervasive phenomenon—in
volving mostly female children and male perpetrators—was
something society would not allow itself to know until the
women's movement broke the code of silence. Within two
years of media exposure, people were already complaining they

[p. <i>225</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00238&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Working on these issues in therapy did not cure Emily's eating
disorder overnight. She was now accustomed to allowing
her body to speak for her. She quickly regained the twenty
"Jimmy pounds" she had lost. The extra weight made her feel
more distant from him, less enamored and vulnerable. Another
reason she gained the weight quickly is that Nesta had caught
her purging and shamed her. Emily took extra pains to hide her
behavior, but several months after her bulimia had started, the
toilet backed up. Nesta said if she didn't stop, they might need
to reconsider living together.


Emily was not one for ultimatums, and she swiftly informed
Nesta that the street people she knew were kinder and wiser
than 90 percent of the people who lived in houses. She would
leave whenever Nesta wanted her to.


These reports made me nervous that a call would come
from Emily very soon saying she had indeed decamped.


"That sexist bitch is not going to call me disgusting," said
Emily. "I mean I like her a lot, and I love her kid almost like my
own, but I will not be called disgusting. ..."


The concept of transference does not apply only to the therapist-patient
relationship. Emily was allowing Nesta to stand in
for all the other people who had abandoned her—the foster
parents, the minister, and Enrique, too. A lot of people had become
fed up with Emily, and she was finally getting the chance
to talk back. I pointed out that Nesta obviously cared deeply for
Emily—that she felt the behavior was disgusting, not Emily
herself. And she wouldn't have this reaction to Nesta if her
words didn't ring true. Emily believed herself to be disgusting.
And this, I said, was what we had to change. She was a good and

[p. <i>226</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00239&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"When you say nice stuff to me, my first thought is to say,
‘Cut it out. You're just jerking me around.’"


"And the second?"


"My second thought is: Don't stop. I love kindness. I remember
the first day I came here and you called me ‘a strong
woman.’ Christ, it made me want to live and make you proud
of me."


Emily stopped vomiting to control her weight within
months of our working on it. She mourned this part of her
symptom as one does the loss of a particularly helpful friend.
It had allowed her to soothe herself without gaining more
weight than she could handle. Other thoughts nonetheless won
the day: She did not want her daughter to become obsessed
with food as she had been. And she was determined not to let
her abusers win, by leaving so foul a trace.


There were stretches of time, months perhaps, when my relationship
with Emily felt easy, collaborative. By the third or
fourth year, I no longer thought of her as a child left on my
doorstep. In the second year, she even raised the fee on her
own to ten dollars an hour, and later to twenty.


A new countertransference challenge arose when her former
landlord finally returned her security deposit of two hundred
dollars. Emily had been complaining about being broke
and having to forgo five-dollar arch supports for her aching
feet, never mind Christmas gifts. When the check came, she
proceeded to spend one hundred fifty dollars on a designer
dress for Inez, and forty on Barbie clothes. That left ten dollars

[p. <i>227</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00240&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Her improvidence infuriated me. I was offering therapy at
next-to-nothing and buying my clothes in thrift stores. Not so,
Barbie! Initially, I tried to convince Emily that she would be
better off dealing with necessities first, but my unsolicited financial
advice only made her feel she should keep quiet about
such things. I soon realized that my role as therapist was not to
teach thrift but to help her question the choices that kept her in
a bind. In the early years, she had deflected such questions. As
time went on, she was able to think critically about her use of
money. She came to realize that a part of her desired financial
turmoil.


"I am so used to it," she said disarmingly. "I wouldn't recognize
myself if my bills were paid up. It wouldn't be <i>me</i>, if that
makes any sense."


It did, of course, make plenty of sense. Living on the edge
was so familiar that she could not possibly feel at home without
some sense of external menace. It was easier to fight the
electric company than the voices in her head that said, "You're
lazy, you're a nuisance, and you don't deserve the good things
you have."


This is the area where we focused years of our work. As for
money, the only challenge I could actually leverage concerned
her payment of me. She often fell months behind, but always
eventually paid up.


Six years after Emily came to see me, I considered leaving
Philadelphia for a new professional opportunity. The idea of

[p. <i>228</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00241&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Of pros or cons?" Grace asked over cappuccino. Emily
was doing better, and I was, too. Grace and I had met weekly
for the first two years, but then tapered off. Although it had
been months since our last meeting, I wanted to tell her about
my Boston dilemma. Moving would mean not seeing my
friends as often, but it would mean leaving my patients for
good. Each one would face a difficult transition, but Emily
might find it devastating to lose our relationship. I was the one
person in her adult life who had cared for her continuously.


Grace took a strong stand. It would be difficult for Emily,
yes, and she might have a crisis over it. But there were ways to
prepare patients for such events. I could invite Emily to interview
two or three potential successors and even try a few sessions
with each of them. If I stayed behind for Emily, I would
surely resent her.


"No one is indispensable, Deborah. Not even you or me!"


I did not move to Boston, but not because of Emily. The
change I really needed was a good, long vacation. I made plans
to visit a friend abroad, and began telling patients the dates of
my holiday.


Emily was remarkably calm. She wanted to know where I
was going, and I told her.


She was doing well. She was driving a school van by day and
fixing cars on weekends. Inez was thriving. She was a lively ten
year-old, a fine student who was speaking very passable Spanish.


"Inez talks on the phone, earns money doing chores for the
lady upstairs, and sits and counts her bucks at night. She's even
loaned me money for groceries a couple times. Sometimes I look
at her and have to think: ‘Where did this child come from?’"

[p. <i>229</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00242&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emily said she was looking forward to three weeks without.
therapy. She needed time to get things done around the house.
She wrote down the number of the person covering for me and
borrowed a book from my shelf to have "something of you to
hold on to." This was what we always did when I went away.


I was busy packing when Emily phoned the following
morning. She was so sorry and ashamed. She had had a couple
of beers and was feeling sorry for herself. She was so miserable
about her life that she had downed a bottle of aspirin before
calling me.


I sent Emily to the emergency room and finished packing. I
hated her with great equanimity. She was my patient and
I would always do the right thing for her. But she was still
Emily: damaged, demanding, and maybe borderline Emily,
who could not bear separation. I was not about to give anyone
the power to ruin my holiday, however. This is why God made
emergency rooms, Grace would have said.


We were able to have a session before my plane left. Emily
said she had been calm about my going away until that morning.
Nesta was away for the weekend and Inez was spending
the day with her girlfriend. All she could think of was: What if
the plane crashed? What if she never saw me again? What if I
fell in love and decided to stay there? How would she live?


Emily had felt suicidal off and on during the six years I had
known her (she was now thirty-one years old), but this was her
first actual gesture since her teen years. Why now? It's true that
I was going away for a week longer than I had in years past.
Did that alone explain it? Or had she somehow intuited over
the previous months that my leaving her for good had been a
real possibility?


There was another, more cogent factor. I. had overlooked an
important anniversary in her life. Inez was ten years old—

[p. <i>230</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00243&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was in that emergency session that she spilled the truth
about her mother's death. Her mother had overdosed on
painkillers the week Emily was sent away, and she left a suicide
note. Her grandmother could not bear to tell ten-year-old
Emily the truth, saying instead that the death was caused by
heart failure. The older woman considered this the whitest of
lies: All deaths involve the stopping of the heart. When she
told Emily the truth five years later, she recommended her own
spin: People look down on suicides, she said. Don't tell anyone.
It's no one's business, anyway.


Emily had revealed other painful and mortifying facts about
her life. Why had she failed to tell me this one? It was, very
obviously, the most wounding truth of all. It meant that she,
Emily, was the kind of person that everyone, even a mother,
could toss aside. Her mother's overdose followed not only
years of depression but also continual threats of suicide.


"My mother used to say stuff like ‘Some day I'll just put my
head in the oven.’ She would talk as if I wasn't in the room, but
I was standing right there.’"


I wondered how she understood these words as a child. "I
believed she could do something awful. I didn't know you
could smother yourself with gas fumes. I thought she meant
she would put her head in and cook it like meat. It pisses me
off to think she would scare a kid like that! At that time I
wasn't pissed off, I was just freaked. I would do anything, say
anything, be good as gold, promise to take care of her forever,
just so she wouldn't put her head in the oven."

[p. <i>231</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00244&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I asked how her mother's mother died. Emily picked her lip
for what seemed like minutes before saying she had died when
her mom was just six. "Of ‘heart failure."’


Emily spliced this fact together with other things her grandmother
had told her, and realized something she had never
been able to acknowledge—that she came from not one but
two generations of maternal suicide.


Now that she herself had a young child, she could not imagine
how a mother could do such a thing. She had never threatened
to hurt herself or run away in earshot of her daughter.
She was embarrassed about her own overdose, but said it was
just a stunt. There were only twelve pills in the bottle, and she
had made herself vomit before she even phoned me. Nothing
on earth, she realized, could make her do to her child what her
mother had done to her.


Twelve is far below the minimum lethal dosage of aspirin, as
we both knew very well. Nonetheless, I said, it should not be
taken lightly. Perhaps she was trying, precisely, to understand
how her mother could do such a thing. Emily had done this as
a way of comprehending her own mother's incredible choice.
That was the sense I made of her gesture, and I asked for her
thoughts.


She said the pieces were beginning to fit together, and she
wanted to write about it in her journal. While I was away,
she would check in with the person covering for me at least twice
a week. Could she perhaps have my phone number in Tunisia?


No, I said, that would not be possible.


It was time to stop. I reassured her I had every intention of
coming back. She squeezed my hand and wished me a good trip.


I had a wonderful time away.

[p. <i>232</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00245&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emily was relieved to see me on my return. As promised, she
had phoned the person covering for me, "just to touch base."
In the ensuing six months, she did a lot of reflecting on why
she had kept her mother's self-inflicted death a secret. It was a
way of protecting her mother, she realized.


"My mom was a saint" was one of the first things she had
said in therapy. Idealized parents often turn out to be abusive
or seriously neglectful. Children (and adults) wanting desperately
to believe that someone has loved them—that they are
not the descendants of a bad race—produce a gilded picture of
a parent and frame it for the world.


What does it do to a girl to grow up believing that any day,
her mother might kill herself? Children blame themselves for
all kinds of things, for parental quarrels, for illness, and, certainly,
tor divorce when it occurs. The suicide note was lost,
and we could only guess what her last thoughts of Emily may
have been. We do know that Emily spent her young life consoling
her mother when upset, and acting brave when she lay in
the dark crying. Perhaps as damaging as the mothers actual
death was the strain of living every day—as another patient put
it "on red alert." Losing her mother through suicide meant
that Emily could never believe anyone would stay attached to
her. Furthermore, anyone who promised to do so incurred her
wrath, precisely because they aroused hope.


Months later Emily was able to say how much she had de-
spised me—the one person she had trusted not to abandon
her—for going away when she needed me there.


Emily told me she had been "messed up" by her grand
mother's tendency to let everybody off the hook. Gram had insisted
that her mother was a tragic figure who died for love of
her man. Likewise, said Emily, Gram had preferred to say that
Emily's father was a sensitive guy whose own sadistic father

[p. <i>233</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00246&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Within weeks of my return, Emily began to express anger at
the various protagonists in her early life. Yes, her parents and
her uncle and Greg had had their own troubles, but they
seemed in various ways to get off "scot free." Her parents had
never been held accountable for their behavior, nor had her
uncle. And Reverend Greg? He was given a humanitarian
award, married a beautiful woman with four daughters, and
moved to Australia!


"Scot free!" said Emily. She felt she was left behind to live a
life of payment for their misdeeds.


"It's like in that TV show, <i>Night Gallery</i>," she said. "Do you
remember me telling you about the sin eater?"


I did remember her mentioning it. Now I invited her to describe
the episode.


This is the <i>Night Gallery</i> story as Emily remembered it: Each
village in an unnamed country of a bygone era has its sin eater.
When someone in the village dies, the corpse is laid out on a
bier with bread, meat, and sweets on his chest that absorb his
sins so his soul can go to heaven. The sin eater (always a poor
person living on the fringes of the village) has the job of eating
the food off the corpse, taking the sins on himself. In this
episode, there is a famine in the land. A woman sends her son
to act as sin eater at a funeral so he will not starve. In so doing,
the child becomes an outcast; he cannot marry, and with no
son of his own, he will have no one to take on his sins.


"The buck stopped with him. Is that sickening? Imagine
eating food off a rotting corpse. Maybe you had to see the
show."


"It really speaks to you, this story. You feel that, you—"

[p. <i>234</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00247&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"—ate all the crap they dished out: my mother's suicide, my
father's drug addiction and womanizing, my pervert uncle's
child-incest sins. No wonder I feel so goddamned bad. When I
piss off Inez, she tells me about it! I was put through God-knows-what
hell, and none of them has to hear about it. I have
to have their misery and their voices in my head forever. <i>I'm</i> the
sin eater."


She had found a metaphor for herself, deeply resonant.
Emily felt poisoned by her past. She had taken in good things
from her family, of course, but also their madness, pain, and
just plain evil. She sometimes wanted to purge herself of "all
things family." That, she said, was where the bulimia came in.
When she vomited, she had a wonderful sensation of relief.
The "bad" was out for a while. Sometimes she imagined "one
great vomit" that would free her completely.


In later years, she was able to cobble together a more balanced
image of her mother. She was neither saint nor evil incarnate.
And while her own mother had died when she was
only six, she had held out until Emily was ten—almost twice as
long. And whereas she had been left alone with an alcoholic father,
she made sure to leave Emily in the loving hands of
Gram. Emily speculated that her mother's depression worsened
after Emily started first grade, since that had been about
the same time in her life that her own mother had died.


It was around this time that Emily spoke to me about a new
drug she had heard of called Prozac. She had taken Tofranil as
a teenager, but it proved useless. The drug gave her dry mouth
and other side effects, but did nothing for her mood. Prozac
was being touted as a miracle drug—an antidepressant that actually
elevated mood and had only minor side effects.


I had read Peter Kramer's <i>Listening to Prozac</i>, and I was impressed.
Emily struggled with depression each day. I saw no

[p. <i>235</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00248&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was one side effect that Emily found immensely vexing,
and she never let me forget it. While taking any antidepressant,
she noticed a marked decrease in libido. I was surprised at
the magnitude of her annoyance. Just because she didn't have a
partner didn't mean she wanted to feel "neutered," she said.


"Who convinced America that having no sex drive was a
‘minor’ side effect? I mean, what is <i>wrong</i> with people?"


Sexuality became the focus of years seven to nine of her
treatment. Emily spent a number of sessions complaining
about Nesta's censorious comments about her gay friends.


"‘Homosexuality is ‘an a-BOM-mee NAY-shun!"’ Emily
would say, mocking her roommate. I wondered if Emily were
starting to question her own heterosexuality.


Emily had had crushes on female teachers and had done
some adolescent experimentation with other girls. Her adult
sexual encounters, however, had been only with men. She
seemed to enjoy sex a lot, and could still speak fondly of her
passionate nights with Enrique. Sometimes he had joked about
a threesome, but she scoffed at the idea. Secretly, she said, it
might have been nice.


"Does that make me a lesbian?"

[p. <i>236</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00249&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emily was still attracted to men, but she had been treated so
badly by so many of them, she could barely stand the thought
of trying again.


Emily loved women. She figured it would make life easier to
sleep with the people she naturally enjoyed. She began spending
more time with a lesbian friend from the mothers' group
she'd attended years earlier. They made friends with others
who frequented Giovanni's Room, Philadelphia's most established
gay-and-lesbian bookstore. Was Emily going to come
out as a lesbian?


In a word, yes.


Her unequivocal support of other people's gay relationships
masked enormous ambivalence about her own desires, however.
She was attracted to women, and nearly all of her sexual
fantasies had been about women. Some of these fantasies were
about watching two women make love; sometimes she herself
was part of the scene.


There were only two obstacles to her trying a lesbian ro
mance, she said.


"First of all, I can't understand the idea of being two things. If
I'm attracted to men, how could I also be attracted to women?"


"What: do you mean, how could you be? You are attracted to
both."


"Yes, but how <i>could</i> I be?"


"Aren't some people bisexual?"


"Well, not me. I only want to be one thing."


"OK. Because being ‘one thing’ would be—"


"—better. <i>Easier</i>. It means you know who you are, you
know what to tell people."


This was a complicated matter, certainly not made simpler
by the political arguments she heard from various quarters.
Nesta assured her that as long as she was attracted to men, she

[p. <i>237</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00250&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You said there were two problems with having a woman
partner. What's the second?"


"The second problem is that it disgusts me. The idea of being
with a real woman. I don't think I can do it."


Emily had come to realize that as much as images of
women's bodies aroused her, she could not imagine having
physical contact with an actual woman.


It came down to this: It's OK to love men, but I don't. I love
women, but I don't desire them, except in fantasy. Moreover, I
cannot bear ambiguity: I want to be <i>one thing</i>.


If there is any Freudian idea that has marked Western psychology
indelibly, it is that human sexuality is never "one
thing"—never a "natural" or unified masculinity or femininity.
It was early on in Freud's career when he became influenced
by Wilhelm Fliess's theory that everyone is born with a bisexual
disposition. Freud's own terminology became more radical
over time: He claimed that childhood sexuality was "polymorphously
perverse." In the case of "Little Hans," for example,
Freud pointed out that five-year-old Hans had erotic strivings
toward not only his mother but also his father, and, in fact,
fantasized getting pregnant by the father and giving birth
anally. Voyeurism, exhibitionism, sadism, masochism—sexual
urges in all their variants are present in what is sometimes
called the "overinclusive" sexuality of children. Children start
off wanting not "one thing" but, in a sense, everything and
everyone. Civilization, by way of the family, encourages the
expression of some urges and the repression or sublimation
of others. The process through which the polymorphously
sexual child becomes a "normal" heterosexual or homosexual
adult, Freud called the Oedipus complex. Many lay people,

[p. <i>238</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00251&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the positive Oedipus complex, a child desires exclusive
possession of the cross-sex parent and longs to displace the
other parent. But each child also desires the same-sex parent
and longs to displace the other. Freud changed his mind about
certain things in the course of his career, but never this one. In
his <i>Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</i>, he wrote:


[A]ll human beings are capable of making a homosexual
object-choice, and have in fact made one in their unconscious
.... Thus from the point of view of psycho-analysis,
the exclusive sexual interest felt by men for women is
also a problem that needs elucidating and is not a self-evident
fact.


Although Freud did not say so explicitly, we might think of
heterosexuals as those for whom the positive Oedipus complex
dominates and homosexuals as those for whom the negative
Oedipus complex dominates.


In a 1935 letter to a mother concerned about her son's sexuality,
Freud replied:


Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to
be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified
as an illness.... Many highly respected individuals of
ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several
of the greatest men among them (Plato, Michelangelo,
Leonardo da Vinci, etc.). It is a great injustice to persecute
homosexuality as a crime—and a cruelty, too.

[p. <i>239</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00252&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Most unfortunately, however, Freud's successors elected to dismantle
his Oedipal model and its ethic. The American Psychiatric
Association classified homosexuality as a pathological
condition until 1973.


Most, although not all, American analysts have changed
with the times—becoming more open to "nontraditional" sexual
relationships. Books on sexuality by psychoanalysts who are
themselves gay or lesbian have done a great deal to de-pathologize
homosexuality. Some practitioners, such as feminist Kim
Chernin, go so far as to suggest that the ultimate aim of psychoanalytic
treatment might be the restoration of the patient's
"full bisexuality."


Emily realized that Nesta's criticism of homosexuality as an
abomination hit a nerve. Emily herself worried that same-sex
love was "unnatural" and once speculated that her attraction to
women was a punishment for some crime (unknown) leveled
by a vengeful God (in whom she didn't believe).


We worked through these matters painstakingly, separating
clotted questions, fantasies, and beliefs. First there were the
practical present-day concerns she had about her own safety,
and that of Inez. If she were to start dating women, would
they become victims of hate crimes? Would Inez be mocked at
school? Would Inez turn against men? The simple articulation
of these questions brought some relief, and talking to gay
friends with kids helped even more. "Inez has such a strong
mind of her own," Emily concluded. "She gets along fine with
the boys and men in our life. As for safety—I guess we've
made it through worse stuff than homophobia."


On the "middle shelf" (Emily's phrase) were memories of
Gram and Gram's values.


"My grandmother and her friends shared a hairdresser for
fifteen years. He knew how to fuss over them, Maurice did, but

[p. <i>240</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00253&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emily's reminiscence ended in one short, sad statement: "If
Gram were alive, I could not date women."


I wondered if the converse were true. Did not dating women
keep Gram alive in some way? I raised the question with Emily.


"Yeah. It's like I keep her alive by thinking she's watching me
and deciding what I can or can't do."


There was no telling what Gram would have thought of homosexuality
if she were living now, Emily realized. We talked
about the possibility of keeping her love alive, without living in
fear of her judgments.


There was a "third shelf" to Emily's fear of loving women,
and that one contained thoughts and feelings about her
mother. There were times when her mother forgot to kiss her
good-night, or did so perfunctorily because she was drunk or
high. Emily would "pay her back" by refusing to kiss her on the
nights she did want affection. After her death, the memory of
having denied her mother kisses haunted Emily.


"It was the worst part about her dying. When I thought of
how I used to send her away, hurting her feelings on purpose, I
just wanted to puke. Nothing I have done in my life made me
feel as guilty as sending her away."


Emily had told me many times that the idea of kissing another
woman "disgusted" her. That is, it evoked the same physical
sensation as rejecting her mother did. Loving another
woman seemed impossible, perhaps, because its unconscious
meaning was a permanent replacement—an absolute rejection
of her mother.

[p. <i>241</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00254&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As we worked through these feelings, Emily felt the taboo
on her desire give way. She came in one day with a dream she
couldn't possibly tell me. It was the most embarrassing thing
imaginable. She had dreamed of making love with me.


"I don't wanna gross you out. I mean, I'm sure you're
straight, and you've never wandered around like an idiot saying,
‘I wonder what I am. I wonder what I am.’"


Grace had commented early on about the erotic side of
Emily's transference to me. Feeling like "a guy on a date" with
me revealed more than her saucy humor, although this did not
need to be interpreted right away.


Emily was relieved that I could listen so matter-of-factly to
her dream. I reassured her that sexual feelings for therapists,
while never to be acted out, were acceptable, interesting, and
useful to our work.


My comfort with her sexual feelings for me seemed to grant
Emily permission to accept her desire for other women. She
returned to her fantasies about me only near the end of our
work together.


"I always thought you would be the perfect partner. Everyone
wants someone like you who listens, who is generous, and
pretty, and smart. But I was thinking the other day that—no offense
—I feel that way because I don't really know you. If I did,
I might think you were a pain in the ass like everybody else."


I couldn't have said it better.


More attention to her sexual feelings led her to describe a
fear of being bitten during oral sex. Many of her erotic fan
tasies were absolutely ruined by this particular image. She had
enjoyed oral sex with her male partners, and had no actual
memory of being bitten or biting. Her lone association was another
memory related to her mother. Her mother had tried to
nurse Emily, but weaned her abruptly—so the family lore
went—because she was a biter. The guilt Emily felt about

[p. <i>242</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00255&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After many months of work on these issues, and after reading
many books on coming out, Emily had sex with a woman.
We were eight years into our work when she began a serious relationship
with Amy. Amy was six years younger, a college
graduate who had grown up with liberal parents and who
found Emily fascinating. She saw Emily as a street-wise
woman, someone instinctively political. Amy convinced Emily
to take some community college courses. Emily got Amy to
loosen up and apologize less.


"We're good for each other, I think. But the main thing, I
have to say, is the sex. It's the best. Enrique, you know, would
say, ‘Not tonight; I'm so tired.’ Amy is always hot to trot. She is
amazing. We were both late for work the other day. Ask me if I
cared!"


Emily announced that while she might be "technically" bisexual,
she was, as far as the world was concerned, henceforth
and for all intents and purposes, a lesbian. And proud indeed.


Inez was eleven when Amy came on the scene, and, predictably,
she threw some tantrums. By thirteen, Inez had made
her point of view clear to her mother, and Emily quoted Inez
to me:


"<i>God</i>, Mother, she's so <i>white</i>. Did you see her eating french
fries with a fork? I think it's cool you're a lesbian, and Amy is a
nice woman; she's just a <i>geek</i> is all I'm saying."


"Inez sounds OK, like a normal kid, doesn't she, Dr. L?"


"Totally," I said.


Things soon turned around between Inez and Amy; they actually
became close after the three of them started sharing an

[p. <i>243</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00256&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Amy and Inez pled guilty, and the session was lighthearted.
Emily told me the following week that she had mostly wanted
me to meet her partner and to see Inez all grown up.


And then she cried, like someone leaving a friend at a train
station, like someone saying good-bye for good. She said, "I
can't bear sometimes to think of how thankful I am to you. I
was looking at Amy, who has been so good to me, and looking
at Inez, this healthy human being, and thinking: ‘This did not
have to be! In fact, I could be dead, I could have AIDS, my
little girl could be dead. What if we had not found that shelter?
What if Margie had been sick that day?’ I know very well that
I've worked hard, but you have, too. I will always be thankful to
you, Dr. L, and I will think of you every day as long as I live."


Emily was not ready to stop therapy; she was not even suggesting
it. But she apparently needed to punctuate our work in
this way. It was a comma, not a full stop. Certain questions had
been answered. Yes, she could raise a child who was competent
and self-respecting. Yes, she could find an emotional home in
the world.


Emily and Amy lived together for five years. What broke
them up, predictably, was the question of more children. Emily
felt she had used up every bit of her luck raising one child who
had turned out OK. She was not about to tempt fate. Amy, for
her part, could not imagine living life without children of her
own. They remained close friends, even after Amy found another
partner.

[p. <i>244</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00257&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

An interesting thing happened as Emily mourned this important
relationship: She did not revert to bingeing in order to
put space between Amy and her. This had been the quintessential
porcupine symptom, in my view. Emily used her pounds as
quills, deploying them to keep people at bay, retracting them to
get close. Perhaps, by the age of thirty-six, she was tired of using
her body in that way. She had developed better coping
stratagems, including one that we associate with another kind
of pointed quill: Emily had begun to write.


She wrote in a journal, she wrote and rewrote papers for her
courses, and she even submitted a piece to a local magazine.


A copy of <i>Street News</i>—a New York City newspaper created
and distributed by homeless people—fell into her hands. Emily
was thrilled to read it. She showed me an Ann Landers—type
column in the paper called "Ask Homey." The column offered
answers to frequently asked questions about homelessness.


"I could do that! Why couldn't Philadelphia have a paper
like that? There are thousands of people living on the street
here."


No such paper materialized, but Emily continued to hone
her skills.


She also continued to date, but didn't get deeply involved
with anyone. She was absorbed with her studies, and adored
her teachers. She was making a reasonable income as a car mechanic.
Emily was a woman on the move. She decided that romance
would come when it would—or not. She could imagine
falling in love again, but she was not about to fall apart without
it. A single life would not be a tragedy, she said. The only disaster
in life would be to find yourself stuck with someone you
didn't really love. At the moment, she had a full agenda and a
daughter who still needed raising.

Emily was reading more each year, and had a habit of relating
to her life every book she touched. No theme ever resonated
more with her, however, than that of the sin eater. It pulled
together her symptoms (bulimia and compulsive eating); her
pain's history (the sins of the fathers and mothers); her experience
of herself as performing a service (containing the distress
of others); and her own personal aesthetic, for she loved the
macabre. The image was both abject and noble, repulsive and essential,
an identity "meant to be," yet one she could take upon
herself to change.


Sin eating was more than that: it was a bit of original theory
she used in order to understand a widespread social phenomenon.
After she read about the epidemic of earing disorders in
our country—a trend that was catching on in Europe and even
India—she fulminated:


"Women eat because it's what we did in our families. We had
all their shit stuffed down our throats. How many fat girls are
sin eaters?"


It was a question worth asking.


There was another story going through my mind at this
point, also a story about funeral rites: that of Antigone.


The daughter of Jocasta and Oedipus, Antigone breaks the
civil law by performing a funeral rite for her fallen brother, a
traitor. She is imprisoned by her uncle, the king, and hangs her
self in jail. Scholars from Hegel and Kierkegaard to Freud and
Lacan have commented on Antigone from points of view
philosophical, psychological, ethical. The obvious is always
overlooked: Antigone repeats her mother's act. Jocasta also
dies by her own hand, and also by hanging.


Emily's mother, like Antigone, followed the path of her own
mother in suicide. Emily's most brilliant gift to her child was

One day during Emily's final year of therapy, a delayed Amtrak
train caused me to miss our appointment. I had no way of
contacting her, and I felt awful imagining her at my door,
growing worried, getting angry, storming home. Surely, I
thought, this will not trigger a crisis, although it might throw
her off for a week or two.


As soon as the train pulled into the station, I phoned Emily
and was shocked to find her warm and equable. Of course,
she said, there was a chance something bad had happened to
me. It was much more likely, however, that I had been delayed
by an emergency with another patient and would call as soon
as I was able.


I hung up the phone and needed to sit down for a few minutes.
It is at times like this that therapists feel the earth move.
It's not when the big revelations tumble out, or even the times
when the patient effuses gratitude. The most satisfying moments
are these seemingly mundane occasions that make one
feel a person's molecules have been somehow rearranged for
the better. I felt that all the time, patience, skill, compassion,
and money I had put. toward the healing of Emily had reached
her, and not only reached her but settled into a kind of emotional
bedrock. Whereas in the beginning she had to contact
me every day just to confirm that I knew her, and whereas
when I went away for three weeks she had not been able to
imagine my return, she was now capable of bearing an absence
completely unanticipated and unexplained. She was prepared
to believe that others were holding her in their thoughts
even when they were not present to prove it, even when they
failed her.

I sat in Thirtieth Street Station across from the hot-pretzel
stand and loved the feeling of the oak bench under my hands.
The tall deco lamps had never burned more brightly. It was so
good to be home.


Emily began to think more and more about moving to a part
of the country closer to Inez, who was now in college. She
started making plans to move to California, where she had
made contacts through her activist friends. They offered to put
her up and help her find work. It was during a discussion of
her plans that she chose to evaluate her progress.


"How did therapy help me? I'm alive, first of all. No, more
than that: I don't feel like a walking disaster any more. I feel like
a person with good and bad points. And that I know how to
love somebody."


"You made remarkable changes!" I said.


"Well, let's not flip overboard. I still smoke. I don't have a
girlfriend. Sometimes I wonder if deep down you're disappointed
in me. But who can say one person gets an A-minus or
a C-plus in therapy?"


I didn't even bother pointing out that she had cut her smoking
in half.


"‘Disappointed?’ Emily, therapy doesn't make people perfect.
Do you remember what we decided about <i>change</i> last
year—that everybody wants to feel they have learned to work
and love as well as or better than their parents?"


"Yeah. We said my mother held out for me almost twice as
long as her mom did for her. And I guess it's extremely cool
that I gave Inez the chance to have a mom for life."

[p. <i>248</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00261&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"And not just a warm body," I added, "but a mom able to
listen and help her without getting in her way too much.
You've given her the example of someone who can make her
own life good, by going back to school and having friends.
You've accomplished as much healing in one generation as
some families do in five!"


Working with Emily in those final years was easy and untraumatic.
And our termination felt right as well. Winnicott
compares the leaving of the "good enough" therapist to the
leaving behind of the transitional object or blanket. Once so
essential to psychic safety, the blanket becomes irrelevant. It is
not destroyed or eaten but, as Winnicott says, simply set aside.


Emily left Philadelphia on a rainy day in March. She sent cards
from various addresses, letting me know she was doing well.
My pleasure in her flourishing made certain things easier to
bear—especially the death of Grace, who did not outlive us all,
as I had hoped. I miss her all the time.


How do we judge the outcome of a therapy that spans one
decade and a half? There are therapists who would find the
outcome of my work wanting since the patient did not end up
in a loving marriage or partnership. Despite the vast and rang
ing contributions made to world cultures by unmarried people,
a married-is-better prejudice endures. Single women and men
are pitied or scorned as immature, damaged, or selfish. Luckily,
no one with this view was Emily's therapist. I was able to
honor her desires, her choices, as I had those of other patients,
whether to cohabit, marry, or neither.


The question of the value of marriage or constant closeness
returns us to Schopenhauer's parable of the porcupines, which
ends as follows:

[p. <i>249</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00262&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Wer jedoch viel eigene, innere Wrme hat, bleibt lieber aus der
Gesellschaft weg, um keine Beschwerde zu geben, noch zu empfangen</i>.


Those with a great deal of internal warmth preferred to stay
apart from the group, and so caused and encountered the
least trouble.


Emily was someone who had cultivated that elusive "internal
warmth," allowing her both to love and to stand apart.


To choose solitude freely, to love and engage fully—both
are capacities to be desired.


Herein lies the work of the talking cure.
