Great Doctor, are you savant or charlatan?


<b>Abraham Bijur to Sigmund Freud</b>


<i>The Boston medical establishment, meaning the Harvard medical</i>
establishment, of which McLean was a part, did not leap to embrace
Freudianism. This was somewhat ironic, given that Harvard
doctors had played a key role in bringing Sigmund Freud's ideas
to the United States. It was philosopher and psychologist (and putative
McLean patient) William James who twigged onto Freud's
work and discussed his ideas in his famous Gifford Lectures of
1901-1902, later published as <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>.
And McLean historian Silvia Sutton notes that Harvard neurologist
James J. Putnam-the same Putnam who admitted Stanley McCormick
to McLean--published the first paper in English on the
dinical use of psychoanalysis in 1906 and "put Freud on the

It was Putnam and Clark University president G. Stanley Hall
who invited Freud, Jung, and Ernest Jones to Worcester, Massachusetts,
to deliver a series of lectures at the university's twentieth-anniversary
celebration in 1909. The event quickly acquired
mythic proportions. Even the political agitator Emma Goldman,
who had heard Freud speak in Vienna, attended the lectures; she
had once operated an ice-cream parlor in Worcester with two anarchist
colleagues. Freud himself called it "the first official recognition
of psychoanalysis." It also proved to be Freud's only North
American visit; to have appeared in the famous group photograph
taken after the sessions was tantamount to immortality in the psychoanalytic
pantheon. McLean was represented by F. Lyman
Wells, a young assistant in pathological psychiatry, who told Hall
he was entirely unimpressed. (James, too, was underwhelmed by
Freud; "a man obsessed with fixed ideas," he reported.) Thomas
Bond, a third-generation McLean psychiatrist, remembers his
grandfather Earl telling him of his decision not to go to Worcester.
"He thought Freud had no relevance to what they were doing
at the asylum, and in a way he was right," his grandson said. Many
McLean patients, then and now, were psychotically disturbed and
deemed to be beyond the reach of Freud's intellectual "talk
therapy." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_3058');">[note]</a><div id="_note_3058" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">* In 1928, Freud described his feelings about psychotic patients in a letter to Istvan Hollos: "I do
not like these patients.... I am annoyed with them.... I feel them to be so far distant from
me and from everything human. A curious sort of intolerance, which surely makes me unfit to
be a psychiatrist."</div>


Freud's inroads into the psychiatric establishment came slowly.
The first psychoanalyst hired by Harvard's Massachusetts General

<i>Packard might have been entitled to his healthy skepticism over the</i>
usefulness of Freud's methods because just a few years before, he
had admitted one of Freud's most famous patients, Dr. Horace
Frink, into McLean. Frink occupies an unusual place in the history
of psychotherapy; his was possibly the most famous disastrously
botched analysis in the annals of Freudianism. A graduate
of the Cornell Medical School, Frink pursued a brief surgical career
before turning to psychiatry. Soon he became one of the first
in a line of American ephebes who Freud hoped would proselytize
his new science in the United States--"the most brilliant and
promising of the young Americans," Freud called him. In 1911,
Frink cofounded the New York Psychoanalytic Society with Abraham
Brill and two other doctors, and he was unanimously elected
its president in 1913. Five years later, Frink published a landmark
study, <i>Morbid Fears and Compulsions;</i> forty years after its publication
and twenty years after the author's death, Karl Menninger
hailed it as "one of the clearest and best written expositions of
psychodynamics." Not only was Frink smart, he was also a Gentile,
which pleased Freud, who fretted constantly that psychoanalysis
was attracting only Jews. An added plus was Frink's access
to money via his attractive (married) mistress and patient, the
comely Warburg family heiress Anjelika "Angie" Bijur, whom
Freud encouraged the (married) Frink to wed.

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Horace Frink presented himself to Freud in person for
the first time in the spring of 1921, he was in trouble. He had been
experiencing occasional depressions for thirteen years and suffered
from "toxic headaches," which could be relieved only by extended
periods of relaxation. In Vienna, he was giddy, sleeping
only a few hours a night and savoring the Austrian capital's heady
nightlife in between his $10-an-hour sessions with "the master" in
his office at 19 Berggasse. "I was very happy, and more talkative
and full of fun than ever before in my life," Frink reported. Yet he
also admitted to experiencing a "sense of unreality and an inability
to form mental pictures."


A cynic, or a realist, might suggest that Frink's biggest problem
was that he had started making love to his own patient, Madame
Bijur. Aside from the obvious ethical concerns--Bijur had been his
patient since 1912--there were complications. Horace's own wife
Doris realized that he was unhappy in their marriage and was willing
to grant him a divorce. But Anjelika's husband Abraham
proved recalcitrant. Angie herself journeyed to Vienna in the
spring of 1921, and Freud encouraged the two lovers to pursue
their sexual destiny. As Madame Bijur later explained to the ubiquitous
Adolf Meyer: "When I saw Freud, he advised my getting a
divorce because of my own incomplete existence... and because
if I threw Dr. F[rink] over now he would never again try to come
back to normality and probably develop into a homosexual
though in a highly disguised way."


Freud was alluding to Frink's purported unconscious homosexuality.
Although Frink was alternately promiscuous and sexually
equivocal--he once complained that Anjelika looked "queer, like a
man, like a pig"--he is not known to have engaged in homosexual
relationships.


In a letter to Anjelika's husband's analyst, Freud explained his
conduct: "I simply read my patient's mind and so I found out that
[Frink] loved Mrs. B., wanted her ardently and lacked the courage
to confess it to himself.... I thought it the good right of every
human being to strive for sexual gratification and tender love if he

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What ensued was worthy of a Georges Feydeau farce. Freud
suggested that the two lovers confront the cuckolded husband,
Abraham, in Paris and implore him to release his wife from her
marital vows. All this came as a shock to Abraham, who thought
his marriage might be saved. He had made love with Angie only a
few days before and had just received a pair of $5,000 pearl studs
from her as a token of her affection. Enraged, Mr. Bijur steamed
back to New York and threatened a major scandal. He wrote Freud
a long letter, which he intended to publish as a full-page advertisement
in the New York press:


Dr. Freud:


Recently I am informed by the participants, two patients presented
themselves to you, a man and a woman, and made it clear that on
your judgment depended whether they had a right to marry one another
or not. The man is at present married to another woman, and
the father of two children by her, and bound in honor not to take advantage
of his confidential position toward his patients and their immediate
relatives. The woman he now wants to marry was his patient.
He says you sanction his divorcing his wife and marrying his patient,
but yet you have never seen the wife and learned to judge her feelings,
interests and real wishes.


The woman, this man's patient, is my wife.... How can you know
you are just to me; how can you give a judgment that ruins a man's
home and happiness, without at least knowing the victim so as to see
if he is worthy of the punishment?


...Great Doctor, are you savant or charlatan?


Luckily for Freud, Abraham died of cancer before he could publish
the letter, which was forwarded to Vienna by Mr. Bijur's analyst.
Freud responded tartly that the letter was silly and crafted to
appeal to America's easily manipulated public opinion. But in fact,
Freud was very worried about negative publicity, as he had every

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

May I suggest to you that your idea Mrs. Bijur had lost part of her
beauty may be turned into her having lost part of her money. If so I
am sure she will recover her attraction. Your complaint that you cannot
grasp your homosexuality implies that you are not yet aware of
your phantasy of making me a rich man. If matters turn out all right
let us change the imaginary gift into a real contribution to the psychoanalytic
fund.


Dr. Silas Warner, who wrote a scholarly article on the "therapeutic
disaster" that was the Freud-Frink relationship, notes that
"the question has to be raised whether it was not Freud's fantasy
that he would become a rich man from Mrs. Bijur's becoming
Mrs. Frink, and making a substantial contribution to 'the psychoanalytic
fund.'"


The therapeutic disaster begat a romantic disaster. Horace Frink
and Anjelika Bijur did marry, but what Dr. Freud had joined together,
it turned out, could easily be put asunder. With Freud having
declared his analysis complete, Frink returned to the United
States, where his depression and anxieties continued to haunt him.

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As Bijur proceeded with her divorce plans--this time from
Frink--her husband became suicidal. He took an overdose of the
barbiturates Veronal and Luminal, which his wife interpreted as a
ploy to win back her affection. If so, it failed. She continued to
plan their trip back to Paris for the purpose of annulling their
French marriage. Ten days later, just before their ship was to sail,
Frink deliberately cut the ulnar artery in the bend of his elbow.
"The blood spurting out made an astonishingly loud noise," he reported,
and it woke the male nurse sleeping in the room with him.
Luckily, Frink was boarding with his old friend, Dr. Swepson
Brooks, whose prompt intervention saved his life. Brooks and Bijur
decided to commit Frink to McLean.


Shortly after Frink's arrival, Superintendent Frederick Packard--
the man who would express a healthy skepticism concerning
Freud's methods a few years later--wrote to Meyer that Frink's
condition seemed to be improving. Frink had been doing some
thinking, as well:


He is very bitter against Freud, he says that Freud does not understand
psychoses, that the field of psychoanalysis is limited to psychoneu-roses,
that Freud himself knew this and never should have attempted
to treat him when he was in a psychotic condition and that his treatment
and advice was all harmful and detrimental to his best interests.

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Frink stayed at McLean for about five months and recovered
nicely. He appeared at his own divorce proceedings after his release
in 1925. He moved first to upstate New York and then to
Chapel Hill, North Carolina, supporting his two children with
money provided by his divorce decree and income from the few
patients that he saw. "From the time of his release [from McLean]
in April 1925 until a week before his death in 1936, he served as single
parent to my brother John and myself, during which time he
had no manic episodes," his daughter Helen wrote me. Suddenly,
after eleven years of mental health, Horace Frink relapsed into catastrophic
nostalgia for his bygone years. Reminiscing with his
daughter over a watercolor of the Paris Opera House, he was assailed
by the memory of his heady days with Anjelika Bijur.
"Angie was radiant in a velvet cloak," he told Helen. "We stood
looking over Paris. She turned to me and said, 'Horace, with your
brains and my money, we can have the world.'" The next day he
checked himself into Pine Bluffs Sanitarium in Southern Pines,
North Carolina, and a week later he was dead of heart disease at
age fifty-three. A packet of love letters was found next to his bed.
No psychiatrist would dare say it, but Horace Frink had died of a
broken heart.


Not long before his death, Helen asked her father what message
she should give to Sigmund Freud, if she ever met him. Frink's answer:
"Tell him he was a great man even if he did invent psychoanalysis."


<i>Another well-known Freud analysand who became a familiar face at</i>
McLean was the editor, poet, and art collector Scofield Thayer.


Almost unknown today, Thayer was a brilliant, well-born literary
and artistic entrepreneur who took over the editorship of <i>The
Dial</i> during the brief period, from 1920 to 1925, when it could
claim to be America's preeminent literary magazine. Thayer's <i>Dial</i>

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Poetically handsome ("strikingly pale, with coal-black hair,
black eyes veiled and flashing, and lips that curved like those of
Lord Byron" is <i>Dial</i> editor Alyse Gregory's overheated description
of her employer and sometime love interest) and properly prepared
at Milton Academy, Harvard, and Magdalen College, Oxford,
Thayer was "too wealthy to have to work for a living and too
interested in the arts to want to increase his inheritance by engaging
in business," according to one chronicler. The Thayers were
prominent in Worcester, Massachusetts, a thriving mill city at the
turn of the century. Scofield's father owned several textile factories;
his uncle Edward was nationally famous for his composition
"Casey at the Bat." Thayer even had the right enemies; Gertrude
Stein hated him for refusing to publish her poetry. He was an intimate
and early promoter of E.E. Cummings, who penned a classical
"Epithalamion" for Scofield's wedding to Elaine Eliot Orr and

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As a youth, Thayer suffered from an unspecified nervous disorder
and visited the eminent Manhattan psychotherapist Pierce
Clark between twenty and thirty times a month. Like Horace
Frink, Thayer had the resources and the will to travel to The
Source. In 1920, he confided to his partner Watson that he hoped
to travel to Vienna and become a patient of Freud's: "I am extremely
eager to lay before him my troubles." After an exchange
of letters, Freud accepted him as a patient the following year:

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I am sorry I cannot get you fresh, your having gone through a long,
unsuccessful treatment with another man is surely no advantage; yet
let us hope that the incompetency of the analyst was for something in
the matter, and that I will be able to justify your expectations.... Let
me say in concluding that I feel very sympathetic about the determination
you express to get out of your inhibitions or whatever it may
be. The man who suffers deeply has a good chance to recover by
analysis.


For a writer, Thayer left very little record of the time he spent
with Freud. At times, when the analysis was going well, he talked
of remaining in Vienna "indefinitely." At times it proceeded
poorly. In a letter to his friend Alyse Gregory, Thayer wrote,


Speaking of the doctor [she had mentioned Freud] I might mention
that he and I thanks to our "good" recent dreams and rather agreeable
recent remarks of his own are to each other somewhat reconciled. We
talked things over from the practical point of view yesterday and he
now gives on record his feeling that we are making some advances and
is hoping that in time we may get somewhere.


Thayer's life in Vienna clearly revolved around Freud. In one
letter, he recounted bringing a Chagall watercolor he was thinking
of buying to Freud for his approval, which was granted. Eighteen
months into his analysis, like a bolt from the blue, Thayer announced
that Freud has agreed to write for <i>The Dial:</i> "I have obtained
from Freud an article," he wrote to New York editor
Kenneth Burke, "about 30 pages in length, elucidating a church
account of the selling of a man's soul to the devil in Austria in the
17th century. I consider this a scoop. As in all Freud's writings, so
here also, there are, of course, passages in which 'details' are
mentioned."


Thayer was talking about sexually explicit details, and he left it
to his New York--based colleague to determine whether Freud's
work was suited for the Yankee audience. Whatever they decided,

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Not for the first time, Freud had cut himself a good deal.
Thayer agreed to pay Freud the unusually high fee of two cents a
word if the article was accepted. Thayer was paying for what we today
would call third serial rights; Freud had already sold the same
article to the German magazine <i>Imago</i> and to the <i>International
Psycho-Analytic Journal</i>. If <i>The Dial</i> rushed the piece into print, they
would beat out the <i>Journal by</i> a month, hence Scofield's "scoop."
For reasons unknown, <i>The Dial's</i> New York editors rejected the
article.


Thayer remained in Vienna for more than two years, savoring
the cultural high life. He befriended the writer Arthur Schnitzler
and seemed to spend almost every evening at the opera or symphony
and added to his astonishing art collection. It is unclear
why he ended his analysis, and even his comments on Freud are
maddeningly inconsistent. "When I leave Vienna, I shall, after
two years forced compression, be chock full of the Great Man," he
wrote to Gregory, his lifelong friend with whom he constantly
flirted in his letters. (After his analysis, he tried to lure her to Europe
to spend the summer with him, "having in view the possibility
of surveying the Unconscious.") Thayer knew that his slavish
deference to Freud muddled his own efforts at self-understanding.
"I follow Freud's gestures seeking dreams as does a dog who, when
his master throws, leaps forward and away for the stone," he wrote
in a note to himself. "And in this case (as often with the dog) one
does not know but that the hand was empty."


Thayer started to break down in the summer of 1925, which he
spent at his Edgartown home on Martha's Vineyard. He was cultivating
a bizarre feud with Philadelphia's renowned art collector
Dr. Albert Barnes, who was competing with Scofield for the masterpieces
flowing from the brushes of Picasso, Georges Braque,
Matisse, and Fernand Léger. Thayer asked his friend Watson to

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thayer stayed at McLean twice but became better known as an
occasional visitor. He was so rich that he did not need to stay in a
mental hospital or sanitarium for very long. For almost sixty years
Thayer and his two male nurses became familiar figures at Butler
Hospital in Worcester, at the Craig House sanitarium in Beacon,
New York, as well as the St. Regis and Biltmore hotels in New York
City, the Hotel Beau Rivage at Ouchy-Lausanne (where Stanley
and Katharine McCormick had their wedding reception), or the
Grand in Venice. McLean doctors remember Thayer dropping by
Proctor Hall, one the hospital's geriatric units, for occasional
work-ups and suggestions of new approaches for dealing with his
dementia. After a consultation involving a promising new drug or
the therapeutic regimen of the moment, the trio would disappear
back to Florida or to Edgartown or to a luxury hotel.


By way of life commentary, Thayer left thousands of short, undated
notes narrating virtually all aspects of his life. They are articulate
and occasionally insightful but suffused with the terrible
random anger that presumably dragged Thayer's "normal" behavior
into madness. He wrote detailed descriptions of his wife's sex
organs and devoted several hundred scraps of paper to what reads
like a homoerotic fixation on a friend in Bermuda. In one notebook,
he jotted down the following entries, in order:

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He who has known masturbation can never be satisfied with marriage.


When the penis enter the vagina--note the position of said vagina--to
the girl it's all dark meat.


Publish edited Gibbon.


The Latin ablative absolute is alone worth the whole Greek language.


When Thayer died in 1982, neither the <i>New York Times</i> nor the
<i>Boston Globe</i> published an obituary of the man who had shepherded
so many crucial European and American artists and writers
into the literary canon. For public consumption, Thayer had
been out of circulation since 1926. An only child whose daughter
Nancy had been legally adopted by Cummings, he had no living
relatives at the time of his death. His fabulous art collection went
to New York's Metropolitan Museum--a stinging blow to the
Worcester Art Museum, where it had "temporarily" resided for almost
fifty years. (Thayer's will dated back to the 1920s, when the
relative positions of the Worcester and New York museums were
not so disparate as in 1982.) His writing, letters, and notes ended
up at Yale's Beinecke Rare Book Library, where I found this tiny,
penciled memorandum among his effects:


<i>I have not loved the world<br />
Nor the world me</i>.


<i>Until the late 1960s, McLean had a celebrity patient named Carl</i>
Liebman. Unlike other celebrity patients such as Robert Lowell or
Ray Charles, Liebman was a psychiatric celebrity. Over the span
of a half-century, he had been attended by almost every major figure
in European and American psychiatry--Sigmund Freud, Otto
Rank, Eugen Bleuler, Ruth Mack Brunswick, Manfred Sakel, Abraham
Brill--and received every form of treatment known to <i>homo</i>

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Born at the turn of the century, Liebman was the only son of a
wealthy New York beer magnate, Julius Liebman, one of the
Brooklyn-based brewers of the Rheingold label. "His personality
was always, already as a boy, different from that of most children,"
according to his Park Avenue physician Dr. Leopold Stieglitz,
who added: "He did not readily take part in sports and athletic exercises,
was if anything, afraid of doing things such as climbing
trees. His mother at times tried to overcome this disinclination on
his part by twitting him and then the boy would give in rather
reluctantly."


In 1918, Carl Liebman went off to Yale, where he ran track, was a
private in the precursor of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps,
and lived in a single room for three out of four years. Stieglitz reported
that his New Haven stay was not a happy one. "He was
called a 'fairy' by the boys and acknowledged to me that he enjoyed
seeing the nude bodies of the boys in the swimming pool
and occasionally had dreams of an erotic nature in connection
with these boys," he wrote. "He particularly enjoyed wearing a
jock strap and seeing the boys when they wore a jock strap." In
later analyses, Liebman would report that he experienced sexual
excitement at the sight of a jockstrap as early as age twelve. During
adolescence, he developed obsessional fears about the safety of
his sperm, which he called "spermanimalcules," worrying that by
ejaculating them, he was committing genocide. After Liebman
graduated, Stieglitz referred him to his Upper East Side colleague,
Dr. Pierce Clark--Scofield Thayer's doctor--who contributed a preliminary
diagnosis of fetishism. Clark proved to be the first stop
in Carl Liebman's Grand Tour of world psychiatry.


After a brief analysis with Clark, Liebman took off for Europe,
supposedly to pursue his career as an artist. In Zurich, he quickly
came under the influence of Oskar Pfister, a Swiss Protestant minister,
lay analyst, and close friend of Freud. Pfister in turn handed
him off to Dr. Eugen Bleuler, head of Zurich's prestigious
Burgholzli Psychiatric Clinic and a celebrity headshrinker favored
by transatlantic Yanks. ("A great imbecile," his patient Zelda

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Do not worry about your young American," Freud wrote to
Pfister, "the man can be helped." Freud met with Liebman's parents,
Julius and Marie, and fretted about their role in their son's
analysis: "They seem very willing to make sacrifices, which generally
points to a bad prognosis." The analysis itself proceeded in
fits and starts. In August 1925, Freud wrote to Pfister, "As for your
young hopeful, I think you should let him go to his ruin." But
just two months later, he changed his mind. "I began feeling sorry
for the poor lad," he wrote to Pfister. "I had a change of heart."
Freud confided to the parents that there were two good reasons
for not continuing his sessions with their son. For one thing, Carl
needed years of work, and Freud, who feared he was experiencing
a recurrence of his oral cancer, worried that he might not live to
finish the case. Also, he was concerned that Liebman's condition
might worsen. "My third and last motive, that I wanted to spare
myself a terrible amount of trouble, I kept to myself," Freud
wrote.


Freud continued to see Carl Liebman for five more years while
his patient was pursuing graduate work at the University of Vienna.
He chronicled his relationship with the wealthy young
American in letters to Pfister:


With our lad... things are going very strangely.... I was again very
near the point of giving him up, but there is something touching
about him which deters me from doing so; the threat of breaking off
the treatment has made him gentle and amenable again, with the result

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tomorrow I am sending [Liebman], who has been here since August 1,
on holiday until October 1. I must tell you about him, there have
been many changes in his case. His intolerableness has been successfully
overcome, I have actually grown fond of him, and he seems to
reciprocate this. After dreadful difficulties, some pieces of the secret
history of his development have been laid bare, and the effect, as was
corroborated by relatives who saw him during the holidays, has been
very favorable.... On the other hand it is undeniable that there is a
great deal about him that is alarming, as if he were on the way to passing
from obsessional neurosis to paranoia.... I propose to leave aside
the academic question of diagnosis and go on working with the living
material. (September 14, 1926)


[Liebman] has not yet given up his childish reactions to the influence
of authority, and it is that that makes him so difficult to treat. I am
not wasting time on the question of correct diagnosis; he certainly has
plenty of schizophrenic traits.... the lad is a severe ordeal. I am trying
hard to get him to deliberately resist his fetishistic masturbation to
enable him to corroborate for himself all that I have discerned about
the nature of the fetish, but he will not believe that such abstinence
will lead to this and is essential for the progress of the treatment. On
the other hand I feel a great deal of sympathy for him, and cannot
make up my mind to send him away and risk a disastrous outcome.
(April 11,1927)


In 1928, in a letter to Marie Liebman, Freud ventured a diagnosis:
"I have no right to keep from you that the diagnosis in your
son's case is Paranoid Schizophrenia." He admitted that "such a
diagnosis means little and does not help penetrate the uncertainty
about his future. Even Jean-Jacques] Rousseau was such a case,

By interviewing Liebman's doctors at McLean, Lynn culled
many droll tidbits about the five-year-long, failed analysis. (Observing
McLean guidelines, Lynn identified Liebman with the
pseudonymic initials "A.B.") During his meetings with Freud,
Liebman remembered the great doctor's chow dog seated quietly
at his master's feet. Freud generally smoked a cigar, waving it in
the air to punctuate his speech. (Other patients reported that
Freud lit cigars to celebrate diagnostic insights.) Freud never offered
Liebman a cigar, which the patient interpreted as a rejection
of his manhood. In sum, a bad experience for all concerned.


Like Thayer and Frink, Liebman was not a successful patient of
Dr. Freud. After his brief acquaintance with Dr. Brunswick, Liebman
journeyed to Paris for a few sessions with the celebrated Dr.
Otto Rank, who first hypothesized on "birth trauma." Soon after-wards
he returned to New York City, traveling steerage and arriving
with $150 in his pocket. He lived alone in the Mills Hotel and
sent occasional postcards to his family. Seeking financial independence
from his parents, he took driving lessons in order to become
a cabdriver and washed cars at night to pay his way. But he
soon ended up back in the parental ambit, accepting a small allowance
from his father plus the use of a car. He started driving

Upon admission to McLean, Liebman and his family joined in
a ghoulish debate over whether he should reenter analysis inside
the hospital. In 1935, McLean was pushing a precursor of milieu
therapy, placing their patients in a salubrious, comfortable, non-threatening
environment and hoping for the best. Carl wanted
more psychoanalysis, but his mother argued no. "If Drs. Pfister,
Freud, Ruth Mack Brunswick, Brill and Nunberg have not helped

But in a ten-page, handwritten cri de coeur addressed to his parents
from the hospital, Liebman protested his forced incarceration
("a police arrest") and his inability to engage in "self-analysis," or
any kind of analysis, at McLean:


Practically, I am under constant surveillance. The door must be ajar,
and always constantly there are people in the corridor.... In the morning
I do a few exercises in the gym, then I go to the clay-modelling
room, by way of occupational therapy. At 11 o'clock a shower with
pulse-taking and other hokum under guard (with a nurse). I am permitted
to walk about a dozen times around the yard. In the afternoon
I am permitted to return to the pottery or play billiards with my usually
amiable nurse. None of this is difficult; it is not even compulsory,
but it is inane. It is what my doctors are pleased to call an ordered existence.
I am living in a vacuum.


Psychiatrists who analyzed Liebman always mentioned his intelligence
and his ability to articulate his dilemmas, even if he
seemed incapable of solving them. In this first letter from
McLean, Carl correctly predicted a long stay:


I am here as long as the doctors "see fit."... My condition here will
be a vicious circle. It will be continually worse. The doctors will not
release me now and presumably they will not release me later-and not
for many years. When I am released it will be too late and in addition
the people in whose recognition of modest achievements I might have
taken pleasure will be dead. Prof. Freud will be dead-perhaps you will
be dead.

Almost immediately, Carl's father wrote back, explaining the
family's motivation for the forced commitment.


Dear Carl,


You may not have appreciated our heartache and worry for you while
you were home, but it was there all the time. We felt that in spite of
trying to fit in with all your wishes your being at home did not keep
you from becoming increasingly ill. You yourself often complained
that you felt as if you were standing on your head and could not control
yourself. You know as well as we that should you have lost control
you would have been forced into a state institution where your chance
of helpful medical treatment can not be compared with McLean. It
was difficult for us to make this decision and we did not consult you
because we knew that we could not get you to agree--since having had
analysis for so many years--you did not believe in psychiatry.


Even the analysts Doctors Freud, Mack Brunswick, Brill and Nunberg
felt that analysis could no longer help you, having tried it for
over nine years, and the ones consulted here insisted it was only fair
to give you medical treatment. Whatever you may think about us, we
have considered your welfare above our own.


Carl contemptuously dismissed the McLean routine as "eggnogs,
shower-baths and occupational 'therapy.'" But in fact, the
hospital had many cures in mind for him. Within months of Liebman's
arrival, Dr. Manfred Joshua Sakel passed through McLean
and met with him, among others. Not surprisingly, Liebman's parents
authorized Sakel to perform his innovative insulin coma
therapy on Carl. There is no evidence that it accomplished much.
Nurses' notes indicate that Liebman remained paranoid. Around
Christmas time in 1935, a nurse took him shopping in nearby Waverley
Square.


On going out into the street, patient kept walking around looking behind
him. Stopping several times to look behind him and to stare into
space. Patient on seeing anyone coming down the sidewalk would

Carl also attempted a feeble "escape" that year. He attacked a
fellow patient in 1943. In 1948, he made a supervised visit to his
parents in New York. The following year, psychiatry unveiled its
latest panacea for Carl's suffering. Yet another doctor from New
York's Upper East Side traipsed up to McLean in 1949 to examine
the disturbed patient. As always with doctors, Liebman impressed
him with his general articulateness and mastery of certain conversational
subjects. "My recommendations that topectomy be performed
rather than a lobotomy were based on the patient's
apparent intellectual preservation and the desirability of maintaining
as much intellectual function as possible," this doctor wrote.
Liebman underwent a topectomy, performed by the man who had
invented the procedure, in the operating room at McLean.


Just a year later, another New York doctor traveled northwards
from Craig House, a pricey psychiatric sanitarium, to interview
Carl. "I took the opportunity of asking him whether he considered
his illness a neurosis or a psychosis and I used those words,"
Dr. Jonathan Slocum reported to McLean's superintendent Dr.
Franklin Wood. "His answer was that he was not qualified to say,
but that he believed that the diagnosis of 'Paranoid schizophrenia
was probably correct.'" Slocum continued:


I am certain in my own mind that the one thing this man must not
have is freedom. I believe firmly that his greatest unhappiness comes
not from his being restricted, but from his conflict. I have not been
asked for a recommendation, but I would say that he should go on as
is and if he becomes unmanageable, that a deep lobotomy should be
considered, because he possesses <i>[sic]</i> a great threat to those around
him.

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The radical lobotomy was never performed.


Carl Liebman's condition never improved. But he did become
better known. Although the first analysts trained primarily in
Freudian methods showed up at McLean in the late 1930s, it was
not until the centennial of Freud's birth--1956, when his face appeared
on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine--that virtually every man
and woman entering psychiatry were steeped in Freudian teachings.
The New York and Boston Psychoanalytic Institutes, which
certified "genuine" Freudian analysts, reigned supreme. The top
spots in academic psychiatry were reserved for the men and few
women who had undergone a multiyear training analysis with an
Institute-certified doctor. Small wonder that Carl Liebman became
a celebrity at McLean.


Liebman stories abound, such as his greeting doctors on the
manicured pathways with the salutation "I am my father's penis."
That greeting ended when one interlocutor countered with "Good
morning, Mr. Penis." In his old age, Liebman had substituted a
relatively common hand-washing fetish for the more exotic jock-strap
fixation of his youth. "He thought he was tainted with a sexually
transmitted disease, and if he could, he would get a hold of
surgical tape and bind his hands," recalls Dr. Paul Dinsmore, who
administered Upham while Liebman was there. "Then he would
get contractions, which was a shame, because he was a talented
artist. He could have had more privileges, but when he got off the
grounds he would go down to Corbett's drugstore and get more
surgical tape to bind his hands."


By the 1960s, Liebman was just another debilitated old man
serving out his sentence at McLean. Nurse Constance Holian remembers
him as unsociable but popular among the dotty Upham
crowd. He was famous as the Man Who Knew Freud, but he was
hardly an advertisement for the achievements of talk therapy: "We
used to joke that Freud didn't do him much good," she recalls.
