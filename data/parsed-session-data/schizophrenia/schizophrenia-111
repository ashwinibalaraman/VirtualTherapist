<b>DR:</b> So now we just do our, you know, usual kind of thing.
<b>PT:</b> That'll pick me up from way over here?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think so.  I think so.
<b>PT:</b> All right, great.
<b>DR:</b> So what's [INAUDIBLE] with it?
<b>PT:</b> Um, today?  Since I've seen you?
<b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.
<b>PT:</b> I've been doing good somewhat in some ways and, and bad in others.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I have a little memory problem.  Um, I lost my dentures, uh, I got them, um, just about a month ago, two months maybe ago, and I've lost them already, um, I, I fell.
<b>DR:</b> Really gone?
<b>PT:</b> Gone, I looked through the whole house, everything, every garbage, every, everywhere.  The garbage hadn't gone out.
<b>DR:</b> Where, where would they go?
<b>PT:</b> Have no idea.  Have no idea.  Have no idea.  I was eating, I took them, I should've been having them in my mouth.  I took them out because they weren't, weren't really comfortable, so I took them out set them down on the table near my platter, and that's the last time I remember having them, and I haven't seen them since.  I've rambled through [INAUDIBLE] and —
<b>DR:</b> Wow, that's horrible.
<b>PT:</b> In the house, and I have to go through the same process again which I go to next, next week, next Tuesday.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> Um, it won't be so hard because they just make impressions now because they did everything.  Um, they, they pulled all the cavities, filled all —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Pulled all the bad teeth, filled the cavities in —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> All they got to do is make me, I'm saying all they have to do, because she's the one —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> You know, and she's a very good doctor, and she cares —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> About her patients, so she's going to do it for me again.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And of course just for a fee, but not as much as the first, um, time around.
<b>DR:</b> That's a bummer.
<b>PT:</b> But I'd rather have that than not, what I have now.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, so I'm a participant.  I have to drive to [DEIDENTIFIED] or catch the bus or the train.
<b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.
<b>PT:</b> Because I'm going through, you know, [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm here at [DEIDENTIFIED] —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And you guys have treat me real well, um, I feel better.  I'm feeling good about myself.  I feel like a spirit has hit me, uh, lately, um, my husband and I was doing really bad.  I mean yell and screaming, him running out of the house in the car, and run down the street and come back and park in the lot and come in.  Now, it's like he's more verbal.  He wasn't verbal before with me.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I have to pull it out of him.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I thought it was me that was doing, um, bad —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Always depressed, you know, he didn't like me.  He don't care about me anymore.  He, he has someone else that he's seeing, um, and it was because I was walking around all day in pajamas and, and hair going one way or another, um, hygiene not as good as it should be.  Um, just everything, no, no, no feeling like doing, going out to see anyone, didn't want anyone to come to the house, take, unhook the phone, um, wouldn't talk to anyone.  Until people came to the house to see if I was all right, and that's how I lived before I came here.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, off and on, off and on, it, it would come over me, and then just like it came over me it would leave me, uh, I was on the medication so, um, after I thought it was the medication I should say, it started to relieve itself, um, after you prescribed the, um, the 4 or 5 medications I'm, I'm taking now.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, before I couldn't, um, but I feel since I have somebody to talk to that, that knows what I'm going through, um, they kind of can guide me, not, not, not, take me, carry me, just guide me, and I'll find my own way, and, and I have that, and I think since I've been here, I've been more productive, and, and a lot of, a lot of people, for a lot of people, counseling.  I'm doing what you're doing —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> To people.  Sister in my family is a substance abuse person —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I've been counseling her, and my husband said to me, "You know, you counsel everybody."  I said, "You know why because I'm going to [DEIDENTIFIED] and that's how they do me, so I see where it helps," and I see where it's helped her, and she relies on me when she, who backslides, if she, she has, she's actually one time so far, but you don't give up on them I found out, and that's how I feel about myself coming here.  I don't give up; sometimes I don't want to come.  I don't want to talk.  I just come, but once I get here, it's like something comes over me and says, you know I feel good now, I, I feel good.  I'm glad I came, you know, I go home, uh, I get up and start doing things, and, and just things, active things, not just sitting there watching the boob tube.  You know, I'm not a couch potato, and I would either do one or the other, um, go in bedroom and put my pajamas on and get in bed, pull the covers over my head and, um, take my medicine, and just, just sometimes go out, but as that, as the medicine started to work on me, um, it got better.  Now, I don't do that.  I'm up, I was up this morning at, at 5:00 got off the bed.
<b>DR:</b> Wow, how come so early?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I just got up.  I felt good.
<b>DR:</b> Hum.
<b>PT:</b> I went in the bathroom, showered, brushed my teeth and —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, my husband got up, he has an appointment every morning —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> So he gets up about 6:00.  He goes, "Why didn't you wake me up?"  I said, "Oh was I in the bathroom that long?"  Because I was just in there, you know, just rinsing and —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, you know, thinking and, and being, being feeling good that, that I was up —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because I'm hearing so many people are leaving us, and you know the sad thing about [DEIDENTIFIED], and you know, I'm thinking about all those things, and I'm not letting them depress me.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I'm trying not to let them depress me.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, and I'm, I'm, I think I'm doing a pretty job, but you know, some things you just have to go with, go with the flow, and it'll soon get easier, as, well for me it does, as time passes it passes.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I feel much better, um, I take my medicine as prescribed, and I don't abuse it.  I, um, have a counselor that I see here, a therapist I would say, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED], who is extremely all, he, he's awesome.  He, he, he brings me from 0-100 on a scale of, I should say on a scale of 1-10, you know, I'm a 10 when I'm with him, you know, because he, he, he kind, kind of holds my hand like we're walking down this path, and he's holding my hand, and I'm, I'm walking along with him and we're talking and we're jiving, and we're, you know, not thinking about those bad things or those sad things or, and you know that's how I feel when I leave here.  I take it home and give it to my husband.  I take it home and give it to him —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And says to me, "[PATIENT NAME] you ought to write a book."  I said, "You feel like, I sound that good that I, you think I could write a book?"  He said, "Oh yeah, oh yeah."
<b>DR:</b> So, so you're really getting along better —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was not getting along, we were not getting along at all.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Yelling, screaming, in my face with his finger, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And now it's in his face, well, well not with my finger but —
<b>DR:</b> There was a concern about him spending too much?
<b>PT:</b> Spending [INAUDIBLE].  He slowed down because I really got angry, I mean so angry that I wouldn't give him the time of day with the check book.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Or, or anything.  I took care of finances —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I paid the bills.  If there was a late bill, if, if I was late on something or I missed something, I took care of it.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> He does nothing.  He did nothing, but now he wants to get involved.  He wants to see what it's like —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> When there's a, a phone call from someone when he doesn't know who it is, if he doesn't recognize the number, he won't talk.  He'll give me the phone, and let me handle the situation, whatever the situation may be, good or bad.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because he doesn't want to, um, let himself be known or how he is.  Well he'll say, "Here [PATIENT NAME] you take it," and asks me talk, talk to them, you know.  Um, he has that much faith in me, and, um, I'm just going to keep doing it, and show him that, you know, I'm no push around no more —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not going to be pushed around by nobody.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I was just telling him, we lost a lot food, um, when we had a, a, um, the, the lights went out in [DEIDENTIFIED] and stayed out for oh about 24 hours, I guess.  Everything was spoiled, everything, everything was spoiled, even in my deep freezer.  I said to him, "You know I'm going to write a letter to somebody" —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And tell them I lost all this food, as hard as times are I have to throw it away.  Being that my husband's a veteran I can go to the, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] and buy food.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And my food there is a lot cheaper, food there is a lot, lot cheaper.  Like a T—bone, $5, okay.  A Porterhouse, $5, $6, you know.  You won't find that in the grocery, in the regular grocery store, you're going to pay $11, $12.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I was getting twice, twice the food, and I would save it because you never know when you're going to have to stay in or you just save it for a rainy day —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Put it like that.  I'm not hoarding.  I'm just putting away for a rainy day.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I think that's what everybody should do because you never know.  You might have to give some to somebody else that need it.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Or, or, or whatever, you know, I have gone to the soup, not the soup kitchen, but to the pantry.  I have gotten food from there, so what, so when need I can give back to them.  I said, "You know I have some in my freezer, here I'm going to pack you a bag and give it to you, and you take it home and do whatever you want to do with it."  I just did that to my mom, anybody I, you know, it doesn't have to be my mom, it could be anybody, and my heart went out to her, and I felt so good after I did it.  I was like, you know, go ahead girl [LAUGHING], and you have brought me a long way by suggesting what I should, how I should take my medication, um, when, what time of day more or less.  Um, if I take certain medications at night I sleep better, you know, or, or take it when I go to bed, not take it an hour before I go to bed, but take it as I have a glass of water on my night stand, and once I wake up in the morning, that's why I'm up so early, early to bed, early to rise, makes a man health, wealthy, and wise [LAUGHING].  That's what they tell, that's what they told me.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum, um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, um, I, I, I remember it, so I must believe in it, so here I am.  I have a lot of issues with my health right now, and, um, I'm going through that day by day.
<b>DR:</b> What, what's, uh, going on right now?
<b>PT:</b> The issue is one, the biggest one that's of my concern is the hepatitis C.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I have a doctor that I go to, uh, right now I'm not on any medication.  The first time I went through the, um, uh, interferon it really, it knocked me out.  I couldn't take it.  I had to stop.  My count went up, uh, I can't explain it that well, but my count went up rather than down.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> First, the first time around it, it dropped from, uh, 1 million to a half a million, whatever, you know —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, the count may be.  The next time I went, it was starting to go back up again, and that's not good, or it wasn't moving, it was staying at that level, so and I was being, I was getting sick, and, uh, I was feeling bad, and, um, I just couldn't do it, and I told them I wasn't, I was taking them, but I was taking the medication, but I wasn't, uh, complying, compliance I guess the word is, at the time when —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> How, and, you know, I took it when I felt like, okay I feel okay now I can take it —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I, I know, and it wouldn't be so bad, when I feeling bad I wouldn't take another to feel worse, you know, another shot or the other pills that I was taking, so I couldn't do it, but he said we'll try again, we'll try again.  It's never too late, as long as I'm walking on this earth, it's never too late, and I've invested, uh, some time into studying about herbs, and, and, and I know that certain ones you cannot mix, um, um, um, a pharmaceutical medication, so a tea or something, uh, is good for anybody —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Like vodka, vodka is an herb, you know, all things like that I, I participate in.  I, I drink my, my vitamin drink in the morning, and before you put any food in your stomach I do that, and I feel I'm keeping myself healthy until I go back again because I'm going to try it again.  I'm, I'm never going to give up.  Uh, I'm going to try it again.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And as far as my methadone, which you know I'm on.  Um, they're detoxing me.  I decided I wanted to detox.  I feel strong enough right now that I may be able to do that, and I'm doing it.
<b>DR:</b> Right, you go, last you said you go down to like 2 mg —
<b>PT:</b> 2 mg a —
<b>DR:</b> Per week.
<b>PT:</b> Per week, and they, what did was they said that I did not have methadone in my system when they took my urine once —
<b>DR:</b> Hum.
<b>PT:</b> And they monitored me, and I —
<b>DR:</b> You're getting down pretty low.
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no, no, no, no I was on my regular treatment plan —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> All right, but they didn't see any methadone in my system, in my urine.  I go, "Maybe the lab made a mistake because you know I drink everyday if I don't drink I feel," they —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Said there was no meth, they could have said cocaine.  They didn't find any other illusive drugs or —
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>PT:</b> So they said no, no on the cocaine, no methadone in my system.  I, I, I flipped out.  I flipped out because I did not drink my, I mean I drank my methadone —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> When I'm supposed to drink it, maybe a little later sometimes in the morning, maybe some a little early, but the never exact time.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I don't have no exact time.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And to tell me that, and to say I had 30 bottles and the state came in and saw that they would be reprimanded.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, but who's right, who's wrong.  Humans, beings are, are mistakable, um, somebody made a mistake down the line somewhere —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because I know in my heart, in my soul that I drank, and I, I had that methadone in my system.  I said, "It's in my bones.  I, I should be on front board up here, uh, patient of the month [LAUGHING] because I have been doing that well with my 30, or 28 bottles" —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Twenty—eight bottles, and they took them down, they took me down to once a week I have to go, go in now, but I'm not complaining.  I'm doing what I have to do.  It's a pleasure to go in.  I, I, I had more, uh, um, time to, at home, maybe I had too much time at home, maybe I should be going twice a week, may once a week.  This way it, it makes me stronger in other ways, you know, um, and the group said that I tend, I attend to sometimes, I couldn't attend because I wasn't going but once a month, so, so be it.  I'll do what I have to do to, uh, make myself even better at [AGE] [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Sounds good.
<b>PT:</b> Sounds good.  All right, well it is good.  I think it's good, and you guys have done wonders for me.  I'm glad you exist for people out there like me.  The people that don't abuse after they get on the program, you know, this program or, and, and come in, I must say I sometimes, I feel, I feel, I feel when I'm sleeping it's, it's a little difficult to put my sleep away and then say I got to go here, you know, that's like a priority to me, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> That's my, that's my pacifier sometimes, but it's only for about an hour or two, you know, just to get a little nap because of the medication maybe or because of my sugar's going down and I'm diabetic.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, you know, with all that I should be laying it out, I should be sitting like this somewhere, you know, all slumped over the chair, um, not that I should be but some people do because they have probably given up or they just feel bad, but thank God I don't feel bad.  I feel good, and I feel bad when I miss seeing you guys, um, because I'm thinking things that, well maybe they won't see me again because I missed an appointment.  I'm really scared, um, I, I need these people you know.  I, I need [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  I need, um, [NAME OTHER], and, and to even think that makes me, um, afraid, and it makes me afraid to think too that one day I'm going off the methadone, and I'm going to hurt because I've been, I was clean once for 10 years.  I was clean.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I was, I was using drugs with, I was injecting.  Second time around after 10 years, um, someone started snorting and I started snorting and next thing I know I was still snorting and still snorting.  I never went back to the needle, never, never intravenous again, but just the snorting alone was, you know, it was too, it, I was doing it, but I never overdosed, never greedy, greedy.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And coming here helps me to keep myself clean.  You have been one of the best fine doctors.  I know I got you first when I first started this program, then I lost you, and then I found you again over here at [DEIDENTIFIED].  They told me you had left and went to [DEIDENTIFIED].  I was like, "Oh no," and here I am again.  You just can't get rid of me [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> That's true.
<b>PT:</b> Do you remember that?  The very first time?
<b>DR:</b> No, I do remember that —
<b>PT:</b> You do remember that.
<b>DR:</b> When you were going [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] yeah, yeah, and I got, um, who did I get?  I can't quite remember who I got, but whoever it was, was doing the receptionist said, "I saw, I saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] today."  You know, she used to tell me I saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], uh, you know he's doing, I said, " How is he?"  "Oh, he's doing good he's in [DEIDENTIFIED], you know."
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> She knew that, you know —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> That there was, there was reading of the minds —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Between us, you know, um, when you tell me to do something, I did it, not because I'm, I'm, I'm scared, but I, I knew you knew what you were doing and what you said I should do because it would help me.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I appreciate it.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, indeed.
<b>DR:</b> I think that you're due for meds, uh, prescriptions, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I am.
<b>DR:</b> Now, are you doing the three month, through the mail.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I am.  Only thing I can't get for three months is, um, gee, um, Alprazolam and the, um —
<b>DR:</b> Ambien.
<b>PT:</b> Ambien, right.  I can, I can get 1 refill on them, but the other 1s I can get 3 refills.  I think the most you can get is 3 refills, so I'm do for all of them.  I called yesterday to see.
<b>DR:</b> But do you, do you get, uh, but you get three months at a time on the other 1s?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah three months at a time, so I don't have to get it for three months.
<b>DR:</b> You, you, you, do it through the mail or you do it locally.
<b>PT:</b> Do it through the mail because —
<b>DR:</b> But they won't do three months on the Ambien or that Alprazolam.
<b>PT:</b> I have to pay for it, and I don't have the, um, I don't have the money.
<b>DR:</b> So those we do locally.
<b>PT:</b> We do locally, well, we do one locally just in case it doesn't get to them on time because they, they take, they sit and they kind of send it in a month's time, but if you don't get your prescription in on time they take their time.  They have a lot of other people.
<b>DR:</b> Well what we —
<b>PT:</b> I mean this place is in [DEIDENTIFIED].  You usually give me one just in case they don't get it to me in the mail or it gets stolen, lost, or whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Well, we could do it, we could to those two locally, and we could do the others, the other ones through the mail.  You want to do it that way?
<b>PT:</b> Um, and get them through the mail because if I bought all of them through, I just get one, one, one supply —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> One month's supply locally of each 1 of those, just 1.
<b>DR:</b> Those 2.
<b>PT:</b> Just those 2 and the other 1s I get, um, one refill and, uh, and, and a prescription.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so let me, let me do that.  All right, I'm just writing scripts on the sheet, so.
