Suicide is a form of murder--premeditated murder. It isn't
something you do the first time you think of doing it. It
takes getting used to. And you need the means, the opportunity,
the motive. A successful suicide demands good organization
and a cool head, both of which are usually
incompatible with the suicidal state of mind.


It's important to cultivate detachment. One way to do
this is to practice imagining yourself dead, or in the process
of dying. If there's a window, you must imagine your
body falling out the window. If there's a knife, you must
imagine the knife piercing your skin. If there's a train coming,
you must imagine your torso flattened under its
wheels. These exercises are necessary to achieving the
proper distance.


The motive is paramount. Without a strong motive, you're
sunk.


My motives were weak: an American-history paper I
didn't want to write and the question I'd asked months earlier,
Why not kill myself? Dead, I wouldn't have to write the
paper. Nor would I have to keep debating the question.


The debate was wearing me out. Once you've posed that
question, it won't go away. I think many people kill themselves

Anything I thought or did was immediately drawn into
the debate. Made a stupid remark--why not kill myself?
Missed the bus--better put an end to it all. Even the good
got in there. I liked that movie--maybe I shouldn't kill
myself.


Actually, it was only part of myself I wanted to kill: the
part that wanted to kill herself, that dragged me into the
suicide debate and made every window, kitchen implement,
and subway station a rehearsal for tragedy.


I didn't figure this out, though, until after I'd swallowed
the fifty aspirin.


I had a boyfriend named Johnny who wrote me love
poems--good ones. I called him up, said I was going to kill
myself, left the phone off the hook, took my fifty aspirin,
and realized it was a mistake. Then I went out to get some
milk, which my mother had asked me to do before I took
the aspirin.


Johnny called the police. They went to my house and
told my mother what I'd done. She turned up in the A&P; on
Mass. Ave. just as I was about to pass out over the meat
counter.


As I walked the five blocks to the A&P; I was gripped by
humiliation and regret. I'd made a mistake and I was going
to die because of it. Perhaps I even deserved to die because
of it. I began to cry about my death. For a moment, I felt
compassion for myself and all the unhappiness I contained.
Then things started to blur and whiz. By the time I reached
the store, the world had been reduced to a narrow, throbbing

Having my stomach pumped brought me around. They
took a long tube and put it slowly up my nose and down the
back of my throat. That was like being choked to death.
Then they began to pump. That was like having blood
drawn on a massive scale--the suction, the sense of tissue
collapsing and touching itself in a way it shouldn't, the
nausea as all that was inside was pulled out. It was a good
deterrent. Next time, I decided, I certainly wouldn't take
aspirin.


But when they were done, I wondered if there would be
a next time. I felt good. I wasn't dead, yet something was
dead. Perhaps I'd managed my peculiar objective of partial
suicide. I was lighter, airier than I'd been in years.


My airiness lasted for months. I did some of my homework.
I stopped seeing Johnny and took up with my English
teacher, who wrote even better poems, though not to me. I
went to New York with him, he took me to the Frick to see
the Vermeers.


The only odd thing was that suddenly I was a vegetarian.


I associated meat with suicide, because of passing out at
the meat counter. But I knew there was more to it.


The meat was bruised, bleeding, and imprisoned in a tight
wrapping. And, though I had a six-month respite from thinking
about it, so was I.
