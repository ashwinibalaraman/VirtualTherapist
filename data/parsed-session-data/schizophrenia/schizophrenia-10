BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: Client 1325-017. Client 1325-017. Interview number 5. Interview number 5. Interview number 5. (inaudible) counselor. (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Yeah, I know. There's something I need to talk about; that I should really talk about so....
COUNSELOR: This interview is recorded on the long side. It makes a difference in the way it sounds. It's recorded on the long side. (inaudible) recorded on the sunny (ph) 0:00:52.7
PATIENT: Well, anyhow, as I've said, I was raised in this really pure town (inaudible) 
COUNSELOR: Yes. 
PATIENT: And, you know, I haven't had sexual relationship before marriage. I'm sure my mother thought it was worse than murder or something. Everything's (inaudible) and like it was really kind of traumatic for me the first time so (inaudible) guy....
COUNSELOR: First (inaudible)
PATIENT: Yeah and you know, I really I feel like...I'm...I think I really...I know I really honestly enjoy it and everything but I think there are a lot of inhibitions and stuff left over and....
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 
PATIENT: What?
COUNSELOR: It's not surprising. 0:01:48.7
PATIENT: Yeah. And that kind of came out with this other guy (inaudible) Yeah. Well it seems to be at least a semi-ongoing thing, you know, but he was saying that I'm really very self conscious and of course, I have no way to compare that. I....(overlapping voices) a lot of people are. And I guess it really, really scares me that....you know, just again this feeling of sexual inadequacy (inaudible) and I don't know....I'm just kind of afraid that it's the kind of thing that just could be mocked. You know, that he could talk to other people about everything and it's just...it seems like....I don't know it just seems like a disaster, you know? 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible) potential disaster. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Oh, yeah. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you know you do enjoy it (inaudible) maybe kind of compared to other people, other girls I mean, you have to be "broken in".
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Like, you know, maybe you know just do appear inhibited like that compared to other girls. That's kind of really troubling you, I think. You're feeling maybe like you're (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Yeah. And like, you know, I don't doubt myself that I enjoy it but I just have a felling that other people doubt I enjoy it and that really bothers me. 
COUNSELOR: Why would you want...what....what...on what basis would you think that other people doubt that you enjoy it? 
PATIENT: Well, I guess if I (inaudible) like I've never had an orgasm and, I don't know....just seems like something shameful or something, you know?
COUNSELOR: It's something shameful to have an orgasm?
PATIENT: No, not to. 0:03:58.8
COUNSELOR: You feel like there's something wrong with you....
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Sexually because you haven't had an orgasm.
PATIENT: Yeah, I just feel really inadequate. 
COUNSELOR: Am I capable of it?
PATIENT: Yeah and.....
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) full enjoy it.
PATIENT: Yeah. Oh, I...I have real doubts about whether I'm capable of it. I guess I'm really kind of, you know, I kind of find it humiliating or something. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Well, that there's something wrong with me. 
COUNSELOR: Like you know you're different than other girls. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I know I'm not frigid, you know. I know I enjoy it and I really...I know I really need it. But I don't know...I'm just...you know, I'm really afraid of...well, I guess it comes down to afraid of what other people are going to say, you know? Like it's kind of a disgrace to have.....
COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's kind of the other side of it. It's like you wonder if there is something wrong with you (inaudible) you know you're not frigid. Am I....can I have an orgasm or why can't I? (inaudible) What's he going to think about me? Would he say something to other people? (inaudible) people (inaudible) that Helen is frigid.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Helen is sexually na�ve. It just doesn't (inaudible) it's all about. It really worries you. 
PATIENT: Yeah, it does. And I really doubt that he's the kind of person who'll run around screaming off the rooftops, you know? But it's not just...not just another (inaudible) you know, it's kind of like I'm hung up about my hang ups and self conscious about my self consciousness and.... 0:05:58.2
COUNSELOR: Yeah, well, it's one thing...you know, you're hung up about it and wondering if you're hung up about it but [then is it going to get also kind of] (ph) hung up about it becoming known that you're hung up. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like, on the one hand you feel like well, you can say to yourself he's not the kind of guy who would say something to other people; you really worry that he will.
PATIENT: Yeah. I really don't know him that well. 
COUNSELOR: Just kind of like that other guy said something to someone else (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) I just kind of implicitly trusted him, you know, not....I didn't even think in terms of having to trust him at that point, it just seemed like the kind thing that was, you know, kind of understood. And all of a sudden it wasn't...it was like a real personality defect. So you know, like...I'm beginning to get more and more afraid of being known sexually because of this and yet I know that....I know for myself and I really can't just abstain, you know, constantly because.....
COUNSELOR: Is when you say you're getting afraid....you mean like you're getting afraid like you'll be afraid to go to bed with someone because of what he'll think about you?
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: It's probably the worse thing you can do. I mean is to worry about it.
PATIENT: Yeah, I know. I don't know how to not worry about it. 
COUNSELOR: And do you think that women have orgasms all the time (inaudible)?
PATIENT: I don't know. I know....you know, I know people who have; I know people who haven't. I guess I just don't know what men expect (inaudible). 0:08:00.8
COUNSELOR: Kind of like you don't know what they expect; kind of feel (inaudible) just afraid if you (inaudible) their expectations. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: You really feel like you won't; it's really....almost certain. 
PATIENT: Yeah. (long pause 0:08:16.4 to 0:08:48.5) I just don't know what to do about that (inaudible) 
COUNSELOR: Did this...was this came from when you slept with him last week (overlapping voices) 
PATIENT: Yeah, well, I have several times.
COUNSELOR: Several times, what? Slept with him?
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: And what has he said to you? I mean what...what I'm saying is where does this come from?
PATIENT: Well, I know....you know, I know he enjoys it. There's no doubt about that. But like you know, he said that I was very self conscious and I hadn't realized...
COUNSELOR: He was talking specifically about in bed?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Well, I think just generally too, you know, which is, of course, true. But that was this specific instance. 0:09:43.8
COUNSELOR: When he said that to you (inaudible) really, really self conscious or just (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Well, I just felt kind of humiliated. 
COUNSELOR: You mean like you're not normal (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: You're sexually pumped up. 0:10:06.0
PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I know I am, you know. But I also know I....
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 
PATIENT: What?
COUNSELOR: What do you mean you know you are?
PATIENT: Oh, I know I'm sexually fucked up. 
COUNSELOR: How are you sexually fucked up? 
PATIENT: Well, you know, it's just...it's kind of a confusion with really enjoying it and yet you know, having certain fears left. 
COUNSELOR: What are the fears about?
PATIENT: Well, I guess of my own inadequacy really. And inhibitions (inaudible0
COUNSELOR: What are you feeling? Can you say more about the inhibitions?
PATIENT: Well, I guess I'm...I'm kind of afraid to do very much in play (ph). You know, relatively passed the rule. 
COUNSELOR: What?
PATIENT: Why? I don't know why. I guess just from the whole thing left over from, you know, being a child and having the kind of mother I did. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible)
PATIENT: Yeah, she's really, really crazy. 
COUNSELOR: But when you say (inaudible) inhibitions, it's like you feel kind of like you just have to be passive...is it because you don't feel like this....is it because like you feel like that's....I'm having a hard time trying to try to put my hand (ph) on it....it's....you say you're largely passive, I'm wondering are you largely passive because that you don't know what....you don't feel like doing anything else? Or are you afraid to do something else? Do you see the distinction? 
PATIENT: I'm not, you know...I really....I don't know. I really don't know whether it's just fear or what. I mean I really don't.
COUNSELOR: I mean you're afraid to be more active? Just on..... 0:12:16.5
PATIENT: I don't know....
COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel like it's there in you.
PATIENT: I think it's probably a fear (inaudible). But you know, it might be just the fear thing that makes me not feel. 
COUNSELOR: Yes. It cuts off when you try to....something you could light up inside of you if you were a (inaudible). 
PATIENT: Yeah sometimes I have a feeling that I feel less physically than I used to (inaudible) I don't really know for sure. 13:01 Because like, you know, the first time I (inaudible) very much at all. I you know, I just felt like I was going to explode for about two days, you know. And then with this guy....
COUNSELOR: Which guy?
PATIENT: This one last spring. 
COUNSELOR: Last spring.
PATIENT: Maybe it was just kind of basic insecurity that was there all the time, you know, where I knew there was nothing. I knew in my head, not the way I felt that there was nothing (inaudible) thing and that he was judging me in terms of a lot of other experience and a lot of other...you know, that I was.....
COUNSELOR: You were being compared against some other girls. 
PATIENT: Yeah. And that his....well, you know, he's got his own hang ups about sex and so you know, he really....he judges a lot about girls in terms of that, you know. And I guess I just felt like there were just expectations that I wasn't sure I could fill, you know? And then I, you know, this other guy....I felt like it would just be a good thing, you know, to have a relationship with somebody that I could care about; at least....you know, I just feel like if I waited around for a white knight, you know, I would be bitter and withered, you know? And it would be a really incredibly na�ve thing to do and I guess, you know, with this person is even less of an emotional stake on both of our parts, you know? Because...probably because I'm really afraid to trust anybody right now and he's not sure about where he stands...you know, he enjoys a lot of women and he's just not ready to commit himself either, of course, you know and so there is like a pretty casual thing and I guess I really don't know quite how he feels and I am really afraid, you know?
COUNSELOR: You're really afraid....?
PATIENT: Of, you know, the kind of judgments that he would make. 0:15:12.1
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like, you know, you're not intensely involved with him but it still really is important what he thinks about you; what he thinks about you and what he must be thinking about you and enjoys other women. God, does he think I'm really lousy in comparison with other women?
PATIENT: Yeah, well, that's probably (ph) it. 0:15:42.0 And I guess that's just the kind of risk that I'm...you know, one of the risks I'm most afraid of taking. I don't know quite why...I think maybe it's just a social thing that you should be....you know, why it's such an ego thing....got, you know, your own sexual adequacy. I think it's just a whole....well, I don't know a whole culture (inaudible) 
COUNSELOR: Whatever it comes from it sure feels (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) feel like...I mean (inaudible) 
PATIENT: I feel like it's just, you know, a total failure as woman to not, you know, respond completely. 
COUNSELOR: To mean....to not be totally responsive (inaudible) have an orgasm.
PATIENT: You know when a good part of my identity is involved with being a woman, it's really (inaudible) 
COUNSELOR: It's kind of a (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) seems like you're depressed. (inaudible) 
PATIENT: I guess it does, you know. I guess it's kind of ironic that I really do enjoy it and everything and yet, you know, if I could just say I don't enjoy it and just totally avoid men, that would be one thing. But you know, having a certain level of need myself, you know, and...
COUNSELOR: It's like...it's a weird thing because it's a weird thing....I guess it's a hard thing for you it's because it would be one thing if you could make that decision...that sex isn't my thing. Okay. but it's like you (inaudible) but you just feel like you don't have it in the right way; that's it s half ass version or something like that. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Well, like I know...I know that I have that need, you know, and I know that I can definitely respond up to a certain point but...... (long pause 0:18:04.7 to 0:18:25.6) 
COUNSELOR: You just don't know what you are sexually. You ever...maybe that's what I'm kind of sensing here that you're just...you can't figure it out. It's like you know I think I am sexually inadequate but I think I'm sexual too. All I can sense is I'm just not...I'm just not the kind of like a real woman like I'd really like to be. (long pause 0:18:45.4 to 0:18:59.5)
PATIENT: I guess that fear of being judged and really, you know....is a real threat and I'm thinking about what might be potential relationship because I....I guess....I maybe part of this is just, you know, there is....well, I'm just kind of afraid maybe that I'm being used, you know. I kind of hate that word because I'm kind of using him too; at least at this point but....
COUNSELOR: What was the first part before the being used? (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Oh, well, the...this kind of fear could really threaten what could be a potential relationship because it makes me run away. 
COUNSELOR: Fear about....fear about sex?
PATIENT: Oh, fear of the way he's judging me.
COUNSELOR: I see. It's kind of like you feel like you must be judging me....you're judging me sexually and I'm just really nervous probably (inaudible) dry and be...and you know, and it's like I know I'm looking through...you know, I know what's really important for me is a relationship. I don't know if I can have it with him but, you know, maybe see what happens but...but it's like the cards are stacked against me because I'm just sexually inadequate. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of a combination, you know...fear of inadequacy and also fear of being used (inaudible) you know, that...I don't know. I keep thinking (inaudible) it's no big thing. I can hack it after the last time but I'm not sure. 0:21:18.9
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like it doesn't seem as big and intense but it seems kind of pointing (ph) and potentially hurting and it could shake you up. 
PATIENT: Yeah. I just don't want any more confirmation when it comes to fears.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you know, it's like you have that fear inside you that you are inadequate; that you can't...incapable of being in a relationship. If he were to say those things to you, it could really just throw you. 
PATIENT: Yeah, it really would. 0:21:52.3
COUNSELOR: It would be kind of like putting a period at the end of those fears. 
PATIENT: [Seventy-five dots] (ph)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible)
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: You're really frightened (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Yeah. (long pause 0:22:14.8 to 0:22:28.6) I think that...you know, that's just the basis of everything. It's just fear of being judged by other people who aren't' particularly (inaudible) Like another problem is...and I talked to this professor the other day about the alternatives and he really, you know, he really thinks I'm PhD potential and all this, but he's going to try to find me a job at the lab school here where I could...it was a really beautiful, kind thing for him to do where I could teach there and work more slowly on the PhD ting which is a really ideal situation but there's a big problem which I can't really tell him...you know, that's of this guy that lives in Europe, you know, will be back here next year. I really...you know, it sounds like such an insipid thing. This whole thing is just so childish but it really...it's really there. I've got to handle it and....
COUNSELOR: You mean he'll be back and you.....
PATIENT: I'm just...I just...I'm really afraid of seeing him around. (overlapping voices) 
COUNSELOR: Afraid of seeing him just in the same street (inaudible) bring it all back. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Because I got a letter from him day before yesterday, I guess and I realized that emotionally I'm just still totally involved with him (overlapping voices) 
COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) 
PATIENT: Yeah. You know, it's kind of a...I think, you know, like no person has the right to either keep me here or drive me away, you know, where the opportunities...if that really came through would definitely be the best...the best kind of alternative I could have. You know, teaching and having the option of, you know, do everything but yet, this one person is a real threat. You know, I know it's ridiculous but I just know how my feelings are. 0:24:37.8
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) could...seeing him could really [erupt you inside] (ph) 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible)
PATIENT: (inaudible) I just don't think I could do it again. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) want you to go to Idaho? Or just (inaudible)
PATIENT: No, no, no. That really wasn't. I hadn't really thought of it, like until I got that letter and started thinking, you know, and start....and just suddenly remembered that he'd be back. I'd really forgotten when I talked to that professor, I'd really forgotten about that aspect at all. 
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like...teaching at the lab school is kind of like well, in a way you could have your feet in two places. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: But would seeing him completely shake you so that...you know, off your feet.
PATIENT: I couldn't....yeah, yeah. 0:25:48.8
COUNSELOR: Like what happened during the summer.
PATIENT: Yeah. I...I don't know I kind of doubt that it would but I keep thinking in the back of my mind...well, you know, part of it is...it is kind of ridiculous but I'm really almost afraid that he'll think that I'm sticking around just to see him again next year, you know.....just definitely not what I'm doing and it kind of takes the legitimacy out of the solutions that I've come to (inaudible) I guess, too, you know about this thing of being judged and having other people who don't know me judge me from what he said. It doesn't, you know, it doesn't totally terrify me because I know that other people know me and like me and everything and I don't think they would let that kind of thing get in the way of their own feelings, you know, and that's kind of in the back of my head too but I don't know. It's just a fear of (inaudible) 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you (inaudible) I mean it's like there's so many questions about yourself; so many kind of [bad thoughts] (ph) and it's kind of...it's so easy for them being treated (inaudible) kind of feel like you could get lost in it. If this guy really judged you...like you couldn't have relationship because you were sexually active; couldn't have a relationship because you're just inadequate, you know, generally. You're not capable of seeing this guy. 
PATIENT: You know I'm not. I really kind of feel guilty for even having feelings because I know their so adolescent, you know. And I hate myself for being 13 at such an advanced age. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of....yeah but that's what you're (inaudible) like you feel like you have to kind of go back and (inaudible) do what other people kind of supposedly got over. 
PATIENT: (overlapping voices) relive all this. Yeah. Because I know that....just from what I went through over the summer and fall that just pretending that things are really okay.... you know pretending that other people and even to myself, as much as I can, but that doesn't work. (overlapping voices) they're not okay. (long pause 0:28:47.0 to 0:29:01.8)
COUNSELOR: Kind of right now, it's like.....it's a little like you can see all these possibilities....how you can really...the [way you're] (ph) shaking and how you can really just have the ground pulled out under you.
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Like you feel very precarious and fragile, in a way. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: You're (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Yeah, I'm, you know, I'm really much better than I was and [in fact] (ph) there...I kind of have a stake in my (inaudible) before but I...I'm afraid....yeah
COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) it's like, you know, you feel like you're just starting to get on your feet and you're feet are (inaudible) and it can really be easy for you to fall. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: And pushed down to the ground. 0:29:48.1
PATIENT: Yeah, it's kind of like other people aren't possibly capable of knowing why I'm doing the things I'm doing and so they'll...you know, they'll kind of judge me unfairly maybe, in a way. And I know that that shouldn't really bother me because I should know more than I am doing but...I'm just so out of direct (inaudible) it's really disgusting (ph).
COUNSELOR: What other people think about you...it's like you don't feel like, you know, you have that strong belief inside yourself and it's like you really do....it is terribly important to you what other people think about you. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Like it's important what this guy thinks about you is; it's important what he thinks sexually about you because you doubt all those things inside yourself. 
PATIENT: Yeah. You know, I know there's no way I can not doubt it because you know, you have to kind of verify conclusions you experience (inaudible) You can't ever possibly know how you like people except by [the way they do that] (ph) So....
COUNSELOR: That's really scary. 
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. 
COUNSELOR: That's kind of a way of somehow getting some kind of affirmation inside (inaudible) can really disrupt (inaudible) you are (inaudible) (long pause 0:31:36.0 to 0:31:47.6)
PATIENT: Yeah, at the same time, I really hate having people just not tell me the truth because that's just so patronizing to me. I would much, much, much rather know the truth than just be kidded along and..... 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, the truth is...it's a nice thing but it can (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Yeah. Mostly my friends just...and my father say that if people really knew the truth about what other people often think of them, they'd all just go jump off a wall, you know. But yet I really...you know, I have this compulsion to face what I am in terms of what other people think, you know, and I have people just kind of pat me on the head. 0:33:03.3
COUNSELOR: I bet you're afraid of it too. 
PATIENT: Sure. 
COUNSELOR: You have like...I mean I could....I kind of sense in a way now that you're...you are kind of feeling your potential for shakiness and your shakiness right now. It's like you feel like potentially you could really be shaken.
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) now it kind of makes you feel very shaky right now. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Yeah. Sometimes I feel like, you know, okay if I'm eventually going to crack which is...I have certainly considered the possibility. I might as well let nature take its course, you know? Go ahead and do it. So.... (overlapping voices) 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible)
PATIENT: Yeah but I was reading an article one time in Psychology Today where the guy was saying that schizophrenics should really not be drugged, they should just be let alone because it's their way of coping and when they come out of it, you know, if they're left alone to cope with it the only way they know how, when they come out of it they're really kind of strongly reconstructed, you know? 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 
PATIENT: Well, I feel like, in a way, you know, I don't think I'm totally schizophrenic because I still function, you know, and I don't...I haven't created a totally false reality. I think that...I feel like if I...like if I just started taking tranquilizers or whatever....that is just a real crutch which is never going to get me....you know, I have to kind of live through all this because if I once really live through it, then if I make it I'll be okay. 0:35:06.5
COUNSELOR: Kind of scared you might not make it but....
PATIENT: But if I don't then okay....
COUNSELOR: You show some kind of (overlapping voices) you might make it. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: I guess it was easy for you to think about it....you felt it more last time we talked (inaudible) there.
PATIENT: Yeah. Well, yeah, in a way...no...at that moment it's just like the first feeling of life being worth it all...that I have for so long.
COUNSELOR: Renewal (overlapping voices) 
PATIENT: Yeah. You know, that it was....and that's not gone and I don't feel like I'm necessarily regressing; it's just I haven't gotten to that point (inaudible). You know, having to face the next things. You know, like I don't even think that life is totally hopeless if I am sexually inadequate....I don't know. I don't think that I think that (inaudible) sometime (inaudible) (long pause 0:36:18.9 to 0:37:03.3) I guess times up.
