<b>DR:</b> More importantly -
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> How have you been?
<b>PT:</b> Fine.
<b>DR:</b> Good, good.  Any, any problems or concerns since we last talked?
<b>PT:</b> Nothing I can think of, can you?
<b>DR:</b> How are things going at work?
<b>PT:</b> Same.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?  I mean, I know a little while ago you'd been thinking about, kind of changes there, if there was anything you could do different, is there?
<b>PT:</b> No, pretty much nothing has opened up so -
<b>DR:</b> Is that right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Is that, is that the state of the economy impacting that, or is it just the nature -
<b>PT:</b> Just the nature -
<b>DR:</b> Of it overall?
<b>PT:</b> The, of the organization -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> People stay in their jobs, and they just stay there -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, how, how do you feel like you're doing with your job currently?
<b>PT:</b> Good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I got a three, three rating, which is the highest you can get -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, good.
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> Okay, okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I get a little raise -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, that always helps to a degree.  I understand -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Job satisfaction doesn't directly associate with what they're paying you, but, ah, I mean, is it, is it the situation where, do you look forward to going to work, is it, not quite that good?
<b>PT:</b> Not really.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah [LAUGHING] -
<b>DR:</b> No, I understand, I mean, a lot of people that feel that way.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Are there things, are there people there, or things within it that you do enjoy, or interactions that you, that are positive?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, with the staff and that sort of thing, um, the residents, um, when, when they follow directions, that makes you feel better.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Some of them just going and doing their own thing all the time, but -
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> It's nice to see them excel a little bit once in a while.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  No, I understand that they get, the population where sometimes that's part of it, is that it's, you, you got to kind of measure success on a smaller scale sometimes, but -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know.  What are you staying busy with outside of work?
<b>PT:</b> Well, let's see, I had a friend that he is making some plans to buy some buildings, and I went with him to look at some, but he's, uh, um, he's, uh, making plans for things he doesn't have money for, too.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And he prays that God will provide him with all those things, and money always, kind of an asset that you need to buy things with so, I spent some time with him, but, um, it was in the mornings, and I have to get my rest.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  Are you, um, h, how do you feel, any, any changes in kind of your sense of how you're tolerating the medicines?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, fine.
<b>DR:</b> You think that you're doing okay with that yet?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Any, any at all, kind of, flashes or periods of breakthrough symptoms at all, intrusive thoughts or anything that kind of seems unusual, or -
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, okay, good.  Do, do you think things, you know, I mean, are, no real -
<b>CG:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Nothing that you've noticed of concern, or -
<b>CG:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Good, I mean, I know we talked about this last time, and it's been quite a while since now, we've made changes in terms of things, but I guess I just continue to be encouraged by, um, his -
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, the only time, that one time you maybe weren't getting your rest, and he was  describing it as a little bit excited, and that you said that it was just maybe a little bit too much on you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> So, I think you have to back off then -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Just to make sure you get your rest, and -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Don't get drawn into something that -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Is going to keep you up at night, you know, [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, no, and you're right, and I think again in, the reality is that sure, with illness, I think it's even more important to be aware of that, but I think truly from just that broader sense of feeling decent and feeling well, that, really -
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> It applies to all of us, and, and, uh, you know, it's, we, we, uh, I think the older we get, the less we tolerate those disruptions, too, from even a non kind of medical perspective, too.  So, I think it's somehow, the, the good news is we correspondently increase our wisdom to be able to look at it and say, boy, I got to get back and just take care of myself and get back into a routine.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Do you, do you, are you using that lorazepam at all at bedtime these days?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I think I've used it once this year.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, wow, you're really not needing at this point for -
<b>PT:</b> Usually, um, I'll take my medicine about after nine to 10:00, depending on what I have to do at work, yet, and I take the, um, ah, the TriCor at the same time, and sometimes I take some ibuprofen.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And usually by the time I get home, we watch a little TV or something, and I'm ready to go to -
<b>DR:</b> Are you?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's fine, that's good.  Um, I'm looking back, I think, um, May, so, May we got the labs back that, did, did they go over these with you at all?  Did [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] go over them with you?
<b>PT:</b> Not too much, no.
<b>DR:</b> Your, your May, so, your May, what, [DATE] is when you, you had your lipid panel done -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Your triglycerides are 104, which is good, we think less that 150, um, your total cholesterol was just barely over normal range.  You know, 125-200 is normal, and that you were 206.  Um, your HDL cholesterol was good, good, was quite good at 57,um, which is the good cholesterol and you want that one to be, um, above 40, you're well above that, and your, your LDL cholesterol, which is the bad cholesterol is 128 and they want it to be at least, ah, less than 130.  And, and I think it goes back to February, when we checked your blood sugar, and that was fine.
<b>PT:</b> It was 70, wasn't it?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, exactly.  So, really, so, that's great, I mean, that is.  I, again, I, you know, I, I would, uh, the, the, the range that you're in terms of your cholesterol panel I'm certainly, ah, not [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in terms of managing that, but they're, it sounds like the TriCor is doing what it needs to do, and again if your, do, have you really made any modifications in terms of your eating habits related to the -
<b>PT:</b> Somewhat, yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I don't, don't eat out just a whole lot.
<b>DR:</b> Um -
<b>CG:</b> Try to eat healthy [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and, and I think that's it, that's part of the big thing, is that it's probably hardest, the, the eating out is one of the harder things in terms of controlling that, um, but again, you know, your labs look good, and it doesn't sound like you really need to make any, any more significant modifications than what you're doing.  Are you getting exercise these days?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I am.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Are you doing, are you doing anything with martial arts at this point, or are you -
<b>PT:</b> Not just a lot, but I, I still, it seems like every night I have to do something.
<b>DR:</b> Really.
<b>PT:</b> And I, yeah -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It's, uh, something that keeps me happy.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, no, I, I think that's great, I mean, I think again it's, um, I guess even, you know, we, we certainly encourage exercise is a whole mind, body experience, and I realize, kind of, that, that, that's the whole concept, even in martial arts, obviously so, yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I've got some weights in the basement, and I don't, I don't push for a lot of weight at my age, but I'll, I'll pick em up with one hand.  I've got about 70 pounds on there.  I pick up the barbells, one hand, and pull it up a few times.
<b>DR:</b> Not a lot of weight, sure.
<b>PT:</b> Not a lot of weight -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Most, most people I know aren't lifting 70 pounds with one hand, but I understand that it may be changed from where you've been at in terms of the, the, the peak of your condition, but that's great.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I did uh, get a total body gym -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, wow -
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?  So, are you using that or do you like the free weights?
<b>PT:</b> I, I like both of them -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  Well, I think that's great, and again, I think, you know, even in terms of the kind of bone density, from a general health prospective, you know, really it is, it's, the, the, probably the, uh, the degree of repetition, uh, is far better than, um, than, you know, trying to go for, for just total weights so, I think that's great.  And like you said, as we age, that's the healthier way to do doing it anyway so -
<b>PT:</b> That's more sensible.  There are some people that can work at different things, and they seem to grow muscles naturally -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But I just soon be nice and chiseled and that's it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, no, I, I agree, there is a certain point I think that being practical with, what, what is good and sustainable for your health.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> How, how is you, your, I, I know you're having, kind of, some arthritis, and some pain, is that reasonably controlled?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Once in a while I take Tramadol, not very often.  I usually take ibuprofen.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Then if I, if I hurt real bad, at first I'll take two, and if that doesn't do anything, I think I'll go to three, maybe four.  That, that's just once a day, though.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Last night I got by with two.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I just take em so -
<b>DR:</b> No, I think that's, I, think that again, that those are reasonable if you're not needing to take em regularly, and, and, again there are certainly more creative options if, if you need em, but I think if that gets you adequate control, great.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Any, any concerns you have about the treatment, or symptoms, or questions, or -
<b>PT:</b> Um, it's been told to me that the let's see, what's the name of that , Well, Wellbutrin -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Is supposed to give you energy.  It doesn't give, [LAUGHING], energy.
<b>DR:</b> Um, that's, that's, uh, that's the marketing department of the people that make Wellbutrin would like you to know that it gives you energy, and they sold it on that basis for quite, quite some time.  Um, the, um, a, the, um, the, it's just not, what it won't do is it doesn't generally make people tired or worn out.  Um, and if  you take it right before bedtime, sometimes it will cause a little bit of insomnia, um, but, it's really, it's not a energizing medicine.  I think, you know, again from the aspects of managing things like mood, lot's of times people that have depressive symptoms will report feeling like their energy is low, but there are lot's of reason people have low energy.  And so, I think that again, you know, even the sedating antidepressants, if they treat depression properly, people report an increase in energy so, I think that's, that's, I think some, some, whoever heard that, heard the, the message that they wanted to, for people to hear.  Um, really I think that, the probably more appropriate way to describe it is, it's not a sedating medicine.  Um, but I'm, yeah, it's really not something that's going to have people up, moving and running around.  You know, I think that again, and the, the Zyprexa does have a degree of, you know, of fatigue to it, um, uh, there is not question about that.  How much of that's a factor versus it's hard to say, but, um, I guess, I, I don't, um, well, they're really not very many medicines that are really good at giving people energy.  I think decent -
<b>PT:</b> I can buy some of that stuff up there, uh, vitamin stores, but I don't think that stuff is good for you.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's not and, it's not, and again, the, the problem is, is that, there, there is, there is truly, there is a different standard for prescription medicines and herbal medicines, and the, uh, herbal medicines are, they can say a lot, they can, they can claim a lot more, um, then you ever could with a prescription medicine, and they don't have to necessarily have studied research to back it up.  And so, and most of things that they're trying to do in giving you energy, they're either doing it with things like, caffeine is about the main thing now, but they're doing it with just, um, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, kind of a local.  It's a stimulant like product, and most people what the generally get with it is they don't really feel like it's a, a true energy.  It might be more of a wakefulness, um, but, but the, the line that sometimes gets crossed for people, they felt kind of jittery or uncomfortable, or on edge and, and, um, boy, I think of it as also as some of those, some of those kind of things in higher dosages, um, you know, do have potential for, you know, for things like psychosis, and making psychosis worse, and things like that.  I think they're a bad idea, independent to -
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> I do, too.
<b>DR:</b> I don't think they do enough of anything, but they can sure calm the world right now with the, you know, my, my big thing I always tell people is look, if you find something and somebody is telling you it'll do that is,  you know, they, they almost always got an 800 number.  Call the company and ask them to send you a copy of the research that they did to support the claims that they're making.  And  if they can send you some research that shows they did a decent study, and they, they showed some benefit, well, then maybe there is some validity  to be considered there.  But most of them, what you get is, you know, these results not typical or, you know, well, we've got reports of people who say this, and problem is you can find reports from people who say anything, many -
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Of them reports that people that say things have invested financial interest in saying that it did something for them, and, you know, it's just a, again, and I, you know, the, the corollary to this, since I certainly, you know, believe that as a general rule -
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Eating well, you know, and, and healthy intake, in terms of vitamins and things like that, water intake and that stuff, it all is helpful.  Um, you know, a solid night's sleep, exercise regimen, those kind of things are, are helpful, um, but, uh, like you said, but I don't expect the Wellbutrin would to be anything that could, at least, leave you feeling energized.  I think it can treat depression, it can prevent recurrence of depression.
<b>PT:</b> I notice that, you know, I take it at 5:00 in the afternoon, and once in the morning, when I get up -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But I, I think, if I, if I don't, sometimes I've forgotten to take it, I notice a difference.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> I notice a difference from when he started taking it seemed to help his mood.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it sure does.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Sure does.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and that's why -
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] giant, but just enough to feel better.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Nothing artificial just, kind of -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Help you from getting those lows.
<b>DR:</b> So, they've done it, and they've done a, you know, nice job of study, they've done some studies where they've given antidepressants to people without any depression, and they don't get high, they don't  get anything different from it, they just, they get the same side effect profile everybody else would get.  But, one of the things well, I like about the Wellbutrin is it generally, it has a good side effect profile, but that, that's part is saying it won't make you tired, or sedated, or drowsy.  Um, there are some studies where they, where they've looked at in terms of attention deficit disorder, even though it's not an FDA approval for that, and they've shown that it, that, that it can actually treat and help to a degree with that.  And at the same time, it's, it's understandable that if  you skip a dose, that you may notice a difference without it, but, like you said, the other side of it is, is that taking it doesn't leave you feeling like, you know, I'm, I'm, I've been doing laps around the room, or I've got, you know -
<b>PT:</b> I've noticed one thing that I can sure, think pretty sure, but, but when I, uh, uh, manage a med [INAUDIBLE], I'm usually -
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> In there, and, uh, and I stop for a second, and think, I got to get a person their pills so, they're off of that, and they I'll do this over here.  It keeps me busy all night.
<b>DR:</b> Good, good.
<b>PT:</b> And a, if the nurse wants to ask a question, she'll ask me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, okay, well, that's a pretty good indication, too, I guess, of where you're at, and how you're functioning cause you're right.  That's they know who's on, on their game.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> I wouldn't change anything.  I, I think it's fine, I think, again, you get in any patterns where there is any sleep disruptions use that Ativan that hopefully you've got in the cabinet somewhere, where you can put your hands on it -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, but I, but I think it's great if you don't need it, then, then don't bother with it.  Stay regular with your, your follow-up, otherwise for kind of routine medical things, and, um, and really, lab wise, I, there is nothing I, in this time frame then that I would worry about repeating.  From my perspective, the, um, you know, the, the cholesterol thing, I realize you're taking the TriCor so, you know, you're really having that managed and checked.  So, probably there is, even though I'm interested in knowing where it at, where it's at, and what it's going on, I, I know that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is, is even more invested in it, in terms of the, um, you know, probably the only thing that I think of that he might not consider otherwise routine screening, given your age, health and how well you're doing, might be just that once a year, knowing what your blood sugar is, just because of the Zyprexa.  Um, and I think that's that is just good screening people, even if they're not having weight issues or changes, which clearly you're not, um,  can, still with these medicines a small percentage of people can see with potential to see their blood sugar go up.  What we think, though we don't have great long term data, is we think, that, when people have been on it as long as you have, and doing as well as you have, with or without seeing those changes that it's, you know, probably, statistically you, you're far less likely than the person that's just stated on it.  So,  think that's encouraging, too, but it's, it's too easy to test you.  You'll have blood drawn at certain intervals, anyways, it's too deep, in and out to just know what it is, so, that we don't ever miss anything in that regard.  But, but again that would be something at this point that we would do, do next year.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So, you know, no offense, but I don't want to see you for four months.
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> That's all right with you?
<b>PT:</b> That's all right.  I've lost some weight.
<b>DR:</b> I was going to say, I mean, you look good, like I said you look like you're, you're in good shape in terms of it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I suspect that, what that, what that probably means is that even your labs are probably better than they were.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  Yeah, I weighed like 190 some, and now on the official scales I'm down to 180, 182 and a quarter, or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> What do you attribute that to?
<b>PT:</b> Busyness [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Plenty of walking.
<b>DR:</b> I think, you know again, walking, I, I  realized that your, your far more athletic than just walking, but at the same time, but walking is such a sustainable, kind of healthy thing to do for people so, no I think that's great.  And people can see big differences in terms of weight, just with, uh, with just regular, you know attention to it so -
<b>PT:</b> I've had lesser craving to eat.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  And I think that really does feed into it's self too, and, and I think, the other thing is that, the things that people kind of look, and go, you know what, I probably know that's not very good for me, but I'm tempted a bit by it when people aren't staying on a regular exercise regimen.  I think sometimes it's a little bit easier and say I'm doing these other things for myself, you know, that's one more reason not to do that, but, but life is too short not to eat some of this stuff that's not so -
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Not so good for us, either so, and -
<b>PT:</b> Like a Burger King sometimes -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's right, it really is.  It's all about moderation, I mean that, you know, all through the year can we debate is butter better than margarine, you know, what about these chemicals that hey add to diet soda, uh, the reality is, it's really every time this do the study, they just find that it takes extreme dosages to be a problem, and you're probably fine eating butter or margarine, if you don't eat a bunch of either of one of em.  Uh, I think the same things goes for whatever you want to substitute for sugar, it's, you know, it's, none of them are probably that problematic for you if  you're not having mega doses.  But when they give a rat eight times the amount that we're supposed to be drinking in a day and they get cancer, what, what do you do with that, um, but -
<b>PT:</b> I, I don't, I don't think sometimes, like, unless you drank the stuff, and drank it, drank everyday, that could case you problems, but -
<b>DR:</b> No, and I agree, I think, like you said, healthy stuff, like just staying regular, or at least having some water, um, is -
<b>PT:</b> I drink a lot of water.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, I know, and I know you've said, and I think that's great.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Refills are exactly the way you're taking em sir.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> The, the Wellbutrin is there, the Zyprexa is there, and I know you don't need me to refill that lorazepam -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And, uh, like I said, we will plan on seeing you in the fall.  Please sooner, if there is anything that you need.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And I know you're good, but I think, that hopefully the clinics going to get up and run, and we're going to go to the reminder call system, um -
<b>CG:</b> Oh?
<b>DR:</b> By the fall, um, so that it may be computerized, I don't know for sure all the details of it, but I think we'll have that up and running by then so -
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Don't be surprised if they give you call, I don't know if, I don't know if, I don't know what all the HIPAA laws are for calling people for that stuff -
<b>CG:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes the ones we get at our house says, you know, uh, somebody in this household has an appointment tomorrow -
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING] I just kind of chuckle, well, well that's helpful, you know -
<b>PT:</b> Somebody has something.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right, exactly, I'm thinking, you know, is it me, my wife, fortunately, you know, there aren't that many -
<b>PT:</b> Calls from the company that I have no idea who they were.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right, exactly.  If you just laugh at how far we've gone for anonymity, but, uh -
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> I don't know what ours will say, but I supposed it will show up the day before so, anyway, all right.  Well, good to see you both.  Like I said -
<b>PT:</b> Good to see you, too.
<b>DR:</b> Any concerns, any problems you just pick up the phone.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I'll see you in October of the fall.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>CG:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Take care you guys, bye-bye.
<b>PT:</b> Bye-bye.
