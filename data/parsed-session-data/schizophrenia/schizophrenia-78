<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  When you're at work, are you able to focus and concentrate pretty well?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Have you been worrying about things much lately?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, well I just, uh, sort of either need [NAME OTHER] to move back in with me or to get a, a girlfriend or lady to live with me, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Because you've been lonely or -
<b>PT:</b> Lonely and, uh, help financially.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's hard living by yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Was [NAME OTHER] helping out with the rent and expenses?
<b>PT:</b> A little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Are you talking with her or thinking about having her move back in or you looking at other options?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And is she interested in moving back in or -
<b>PT:</b> Uh, she might, she just doesn't know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Where is she now?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> Is she in [DEIDENTIFIED] or is she in [DEIDENTIFIED] or -
<b>PT:</b> She, she's in this, uh, little town in between [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED].  It's called [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I've heard of it, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Does she like it up there?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, does she have family up there, or how'd she find that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  Say I don't know how people would find a small town like that otherwise.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, have you been feeling anxious much lately or not too much?
<b>PT:</b> Not too much.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And what are you doing for fun these days, for enjoyment?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, well I went up like, last week and visited [NAME OTHER] and, uh, um -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's, and you had a good time visiting her?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  What is there to do in [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Are there movie theaters or -
<b>PT:</b> Well I just stayed at her apartment.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  And, uh, let's see [PATIENT NAME], in terms of medication, any side effects or problems from either the Loxitane or the Paxil?
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And do you use the hydroxyzine for sleep much anymore?
<b>PT:</b> Not too often.
<b>DR:</b> How often would you guess, once every week, or month, or few months?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I haven't been using it much lately.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you just haven't needed it for a while.  You think it's been a few months maybe since you needed it?
<b>PT:</b> Maybe a couple months.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  But the others, the Paxil and Loxitane, you take every day pretty much?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And [PATIENT NAME], everybody, just about everybody, misses an occasional dose, they forget or something comes up.  How often would you estimate you miss a dose?  Is it once a week, once a month, or less than that?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think I do.
<b>DR:</b> You're pretty good about remembering almost always then?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  Good for you.  Um, what about stress level right now?  Is anything particularly stressful?
<b>PT:</b> Well, um, you know, my, my car is getting real old -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh, um, I don't know, I talked to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] about this and he kind of feels the same way about my brothers as I do but, um, you know, they're both millionaires and stuff and, uh, they could help me out but they don't and, um, I, it, it just sort of bothers me and, uh, um, my, my sister [NAME OTHER] thinks highly of my brothers.  I, I don't at all.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I don't, I don't think much of them and I, I think they're very greedy and selfish and, um, I think, uh, my brother [NAME OTHER] especially, he, uh, you know, like, um, money isn't evil but the love for money is evil and he has a love for money and that's just how he is.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you have much contact with your brothers these days?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You, they don't call you and you don't call that much?
<b>PT:</b> No, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Do you see them like, at holidays or anything or not even then much?
<b>PT:</b> Well, um, the only chance I'd be seeing them is, uh, um, you know, if, if that, uh, has to go to court, if I have to go to court in [DEIDENTIFIED], but I, uh, would tell my sister that I'm, I'm not interested in seeing them, even if she wants to.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Are they back in, in [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Is that where they live?
<b>PT:</b> No.  They live in [DEIDENTIFIED], but -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> You know, it's about a two hour drive to see them but, I wouldn't want to see them.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  And [PATIENT NAME], do you know if that whole situation is going to court or what's happening?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well the detective said that the lady is probably going to settle out of court.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So hopefully you won't have to go back and testify or anything then.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good, less stress for you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do you know if you're going to be able to recover any of the money that she got or do you know that yet?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I, I think so.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good.
<b>PT:</b> There's a good chance.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's good to hear.  That would help you out, I'm sure, to have some of that back.  [COUGHING].  Okay, any other stresses right now?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I don't know.  I'm not sure.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  [PATIENT NAME], I haven't asked you this question for a while, but, um, I, I think I know the answer, do you hear any voices that other people don't hear recently?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Didn't think so.  Okay.  Or do you feel unsafe, like people are following you or going to harm you, do you ever feel that way?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I guess we all can, at times, feel a little concerned, but it's not something that you worry about frequently or -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you feel like people talk about you behind your back often or -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Um, okay.  Okay.  So it sounds like overall you're feeling pretty good most of the time?  Is that true?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It sounds like the main stress right now is financial and relationship, just being lonely and being kind of squeezed financially, is that correct?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah.  Well, I know financially it's a, it's a hard time for a lot of people.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Just the economy and the way it is and all and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And like, you're on a, kind of a fixed income with your job too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, it makes it kind of tough.  Do you have enough to get by each month or -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good.  Okay.  I know some folks that are, uh, not able to maintain their house payments, their rent and having to find other housing or something so.  Is there anything else going on, [PATIENT NAME], that I didn't ask you about do you think is important to talk about?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, no.  I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So if you kept feeling the way you do now for the next few months, would you be pretty happy with the way things are going overall?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess so.  I just, I get bored some of the time, but I just, I just -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Get bored.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  How do you pass the time when you're home alone like in the evenings?  What do you like to do?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  A lot of times I just go to bed early.
<b>DR:</b> How early do you go to bed?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, sometimes 8:00.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, do you have any hobbies, [PATIENT NAME], or anything you like to do while, you know, when you're home?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not really.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I was thinking what kind of hobbies, some people enjoy reading or sometimes doing puzzles, we do jigsaw puzzles sometimes or some people like video games, uh, or compu, you know, internet, surfing on the computer.  Do any of those things interest you, or not really?
<b>PT:</b> Not really.  No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> Is there anything you'd like to do if you had the opportunities, you know, things you've always thought about doing or -
<b>PT:</b> I'm not sure.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe not.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Hm.  Well, yeah, it, it would be nice if you had someone just to share things with, wouldn't it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It makes, it makes life more pleasant and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Enjoyable.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well it's nice when the other one would come home from work.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Going in to see her.
<b>DR:</b> Now [PATIENT NAME], I'm trying to remember because I've forgotten, why was she moved out or -
<b>PT:</b> Um, to live closer to her daughter and son.
<b>DR:</b> I understand.  Who are, who live up the [DEIDENTIFIED] area?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Her son is living with her now.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> So, I told them, both of them could move into my house if they wanted to.
<b>DR:</b> How old is her son?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, early 30s.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.  Okay.  Do you know him pretty well?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And he's a pretty good guy?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Does he work?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, when he can get a job, he works.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, like construction or something.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I was just wondering how the job market is different even in [DEIDENTIFIED] than it is in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I didn't know if he'd be able to find a job or, and [NAME OTHER], is she working?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She's a nanny.
<b>DR:</b> A nanny?  Okay.  Well that's something that people always need wherever you live, I guess -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So she could find some work as a nanny.  Well, what do you think of the chances that she'll move down?  Do you know yet or is it too early to tell?
<b>PT:</b> I'm not sure.  Her lease is up in October.
<b>DR:</b> Hers is?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now tell me, remind me of something, I'm not sure if I'm remembering this correctly, but weren't there times when she would, could get pretty angry and be pretty abusive to you too?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  That was the down side, I think, of having her there.  She could be pretty mean to you sometimes.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> She kind of has gotten better.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good.  I hope that happens, she moves back up, she can maintain that -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Improvement then because that's, I mean it's nice to have someone around, but it's not nice if they're, you know, not treating you well or abuse.  That just gets to be pretty hard after a while.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, [PATIENT NAME], anything else that you want to talk about today?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know.  Just, sort of that my, um, sister and my brother kind of trash me on, um, uh, that I overspent so much and really compared to the money that my brothers received, I, I didn't really spend all that much money.  You know, I could have spent less, but it was nothing, you know, super ridiculous and, but, they kind of trash me over that and, uh, my, uh, my brother kind of acts and has treated me in the past and everything, like I'm a fool and I, I kind of really feel like he's a fool, really.  You know, because he has a love for money and he's, he's so sick about it and he's probably miserable now because the stock market is down so far, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Well, a lot of people, uh, really got hit hard in the stock market and the people that really depended on it, it really -
<b>PT:</b> You know, that's what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said.  He said that there's, past month there's been people who are billionaires or millionaires who have committed suicide because, not because they don't have any money any more, but because of all the money they lost.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But, I mean, that's, uh, like, a spiritual and a, a sickness having a love for money.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Some people it becomes everything to them -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> In their mind and that's all that they care about, which is really sad to me.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, but there are some people that really get out of balance in their lives.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, the good thing is [PATIENT NAME], you haven't.  There are also people who go, you know, we can also go to the other extreme where, you know, we, uh, we don't value money at all and, and can, I know people that have really gotten hurt in their lives because they had money and then they didn't and they didn't have enough to even support themselves or take care of themselves.  So I think, as with most things in life, a balanced approach is usually the best.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Where we're not attached to money, but we don't, not wasteful with it either so -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If we can find somewhere in the middle we're pro, we're usually doing okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, um, any other, there are people that can get a, addicted or attached to just about anything in life -
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> Money or status or material things but, um, it doesn't make them happy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And I think for those people sometimes they just have to learn that that's not what brings them happy, that's -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And find the things that really are important to them in their lives.  So but [PATIENT NAME], it seems like for you, you do a pretty good job of, you know, looking at what makes you happy in life and what kind of things are important to you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And I think that's the important thing and the other thing is we can't change other people, you know, even if we know things like that money, you know, attachment to money is unhealthy, we can't make other people see that or understand it.  They have to learn it for themselves.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, like if your brother were miserable because he was addicted to money, that's a lesson that probably he'll have to figure out.  You -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You could tell him that, but he wouldn't probably listen to you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So.  Okay.  Well anything else you can think of that you wanted to talk about today?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, should we check back maybe in a month or so again, just to make sure things are going okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Let's see.  That will put us in the middle of February.  And remind me, is there a day of the week that works best for you?
<b>PT:</b> Um, maybe Thursday would be good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, we could do Thursday the [DATE] is one option.  And I've got a time -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> It's late afternoon or 2:00 or 3:00, 4:00, something good for you?
<b>PT:</b> Three is good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  How about if we do 3:00 on the [DATE]?  Is that okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Here, [PATIENT NAME], there you are.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And as always, if you need anything before then, just give me a call, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Well thank you doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Okay [PATIENT NAME], been good seeing you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Have a good month.
<b>PT:</b> All righty.  I'll see you.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Good bye.
