Trapped between unwashed, unidentified
bodies in the darkened hall. Trying not to
breathe, keeping my arms pulled in close, feet
shuffling forward, eyes not daring to leave the ground.
Snarling starts further down, and I retreat further
into myself, careful not to make any contact
with anyone, not to aggravate the already
unbearable. Unattached voices heard
throughout the length of the line-up:
"Get the fuck off my foot!"
"Quit shoving, or I'll shove you into
next week!"
The line is restless, hungry for food or action.
"Don't throw your goddamn butt on the floor, I
got bare feet —"
"You're stupid enough not to wear
shoes, that's your problem."
"Gimme some room, you fuckin' assholes."
The line wavers back and forth, towards and

[p. <i>2</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I didn't touch you. I touch you, you'd know it."


"Get off my back!"


The kitchen door is still shut. Someone kicks it,
hard. Harsh laughter. I talk to the closed door, begging
it to open: when the line-up explodes, I will be
caught, unable to move, unable to protect myself.


Sixty or seventy bodies crushed together, smells of
dried vomit and urine, rotting armpits, sour wine and
beer at the back of my tongue, coating my throat. I
breathe through my mouth. I'm getting dizzy from the
heat, the weight of their anger. Another kick aimed at
the door.


"What the fuck's taking so long?"


"You'd think they were really trying to cook
something in there."


Someone is shoved hard. Everyone responds by
jerking forward.


"Open the goddamn door, Jack!"


More shoving. I can barely turn my head. I see an
old man crouched like a trapped animal, holding his
fork like a switchblade, jabbing at the fellow turned to
face him.


"I didn't touch you, you fucking maniac, put that
stupid thing down!"


The old man doesn't move a muscle; his face is
twisted with fear and hatred. From the kitchen comes a
shout: "Get back, I'm opening the door!" The old
man is forgotten, overwhelmed as everyone pushes

[p. <i>3</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A man and woman stand behind the serving table.
He has a smug, knowing expression; she just looks
tired. He dumps food on the first plate:


"I catch the son of a bitch that kicked my door, it's the
last thing he'll ever kick. Got that Andy?" Andy turns
away with a muttered "Fuck off, you fucking asshole."


Pushed forward slowly, each advance marked by the
man's individualized insults, heard clearly from where I
am, tangled somewhere in the middle of the line-up.


"Dennis, you start to sing and you'll never eat in this
dining room again."


Move up one space.


"What did ya steal today? Don't lie to me, you little
shit... get out of my way!"


Move up.


"Can't you even hold your plate up properly? Jesus!"


Shuffle forward.


"Don't you ever take a bath? Shit, you stink worse
than Bong over there."


Move up one. I can see into the kitchen now, a little
light.


"Hey Momma! Gonna put on some more fat? The
only place left is your toes, but you'll never see them
anyway, right?"


Closer, not sure I want to be.


"Alice, you finally crawled down? Tell your drunken
roommate she's got ten minutes to get here, or she's
shit outta luck again."

[p. <i>4</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Me. Holding out my plate, hating this, preferring to
imagine crashing it down on the table, shattering it
(though it's the unbreakable kind), turning my back,
walking intact through the remaining line-up.


"Hi, Pat." He lifts cutlets with his fingers, examining
them for something. I wait for my insult, uncertain as
to how I'll respond.


"Aw, this one you cooked right. One out of seventy!
You're getting better, Haddie. Pat, there's a jelly roll for
dessert." He gestures to the radiator beside him on top
of which sits a plate of crumbling cake, sliced thin. No
insult, he smiles, friendly. I back away, confused.


I turn into the dining room and stand, paralysed. It's
so crowded. Every table seems jammed with people. A
chair screeches against the wooden floor; someone is
leaving. Pushed from behind, I head towards the vacant
spot. I push the abandoned dirty plate to one side, put
mine down and sit. An old man opposite me removes
his upper and lower dentures, puts them in his shirt
pocket and starts forking potatoes into his rubbery
mouth.


Next to me, a middle-aged woman sniffs at her
food, muttering suspiciously. The man opposite her
tries to take her plate. She slashes at him with her fork
till he withdraws back to his own food. A tiny old lady
stands by the boarded-up fireplace, her dish resting on
the mantel, almost level to her head. She eats in delicate
motions, dabbing at her lips with a rag from an
old blouse.


At the next table, a man pours tea over his plate,

[p. <i>5</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

No conversation, no laughter, no sound except the
scraping of forks and knives, the scraping of chairs on
wood, the noise of open mouths chewing, the grumbling
of protesting bowels, upset stomachs, the hacking
of tar-filled lungs, the ugly wet whoosh of spitting.


Supper time at the boarding house.


This is where they sent me.


This is where they said I belong.

I lived the first eighteen years of my life in
circumstances that paralleled too closely what I
was facing now. Deeply disturbed by what I saw
around me, unable to clearly distinguish between reality
and delusion, I saw my presence in this boarding
house as evidence of a malevolent hand at work,
orchestrating my destruction. Alone in my third-floor
room, unable to shut out the thuds, shouts, occasional
screams and the maniacal giggling that went on for
hours at a time, the beginnings and this end of my life
merged to leave me a captive of memories and feelings
I thought I'd successfully left behind me.


I learned fear long before I learned anything else. In
our family home, we breathed it, ate it and slept with it
alive in our beds. We were six victims — a mother and
five children — totally dependent and viciously

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Beatings were the most consistent feature of our
lives. There were beatings for not learning to walk fast
enough, beatings for crying in a crib, beatings for not
eating enough or for eating too much. Beatings for
poor grades, a broken dish, an unmade bed, a scuffed
shoe. Sometimes beatings just for standing too close
when the impulse moved him. Beatings always accompanied
by a verbal violence even more brutal.


It was his vacation time. He'd been home for four
days now, counting the weekend. Things had been bad
enough before that — beatings almost every night,
with either us or our mother bearing the brunt of his
rage. There was no let-up in the tension we felt; in
fact, it seemed that things were more dangerous than
they'd ever been.


The five of us shared the same room, with a bed
against each wall and a crib for the boy. We kept very
still, listening for the sounds of the house. We hadn't
eaten that day, and it was now close to supper time.
He'd refused to buy groceries — punishment for some
wrong someone had done. The night before he'd yelled
that bread soaked in skim milk was plenty for "goddamn
brats," and that was what we'd eaten when he'd
yelled us out of bed close to midnight. Still, we preferred
hunger to the looming fight over groceries.


We heard her bedroom door open, heard her in the
bathroom. I held my breath, hoping my mother would
just go back to her room, but I heard her footsteps along
the hall, past our room. I was cringing inside. She wasn't

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For some nights now, I had taken to lifting the
butcher knife out of the kitchen drawer just before
bedtime, slipping it under my pillow, then putting it
back in the morning. Each night, I stayed awake as
long as I could, which at eight years old wasn't as long
as it seemed, listening for the sound of the doorknob
turning. I knew he hated us enough to kill us in our
beds. I would play through scenes in my head, trying
to steel myself for the moment when I would need
every ounce of desperate courage I could muster. I
didn't feel courageous, especially when I pictured
myself creeping up on him while he was throttling one
of my sisters, pictured him turning just in time to catch
me coming at him.


Now, as a steady rain pelted against the window, I
missed the knife, and the illusion of protection it gave.


We heard her ask when he was going to stop blackmailing
her with our hunger. Silence. She raised her
voice a little: "Mike, I asked you when you're going to
get the groceries?" His muffled voice came back. Probably
he was facing the back of the couch, warning her
to get back to her room. She didn't. Her voice now
had a hysterical quality to it; she was not going to back
off. I tried to wish myself out of existence. The fear,
the waiting, was unbearable.


"Goddamn it, I told you to get in your room! You're
going to start listening, you bitch, and right now!"


We heard the shrill screeching of the couch as he
jumped up, then her screams began, and continued,

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Furniture was crashing to the floor. We moved as
one to the door, opening it, crowding together in the
doorway. He had her by the hair, her long red hair, and
he was pulling her after him into the kitchen. She
caught at the chair and table legs as she was dragged
past them. He was beating her about the head with his
other fist. Now he was in the hall, dragging her past us,
her hands tearing at the one that gripped her hair. He
kicked open the bathroom door. It slammed back
against the wall. Our mother clutched at the doorjamb
while his fist beat down harder, abruptly cutting off her
shrieks of terror. He rammed her head into the toilet
bowl, holding her down; the sputtering, choking
sounds had a nightmare quality. He let her head out for
an instant. She vomited as soon as her head cleared the
water, then he pushed her down again, and again.


"Mike, stop, you're killing me!"


We heard that so clearly. It cut through our crying,
our pleading. He picked her up and threw her in the
tub; her head made a hollow sound as it struck the
bottom. He turned on the shower, and in seconds
steam rose and covered her. He turned. We ran back to
the room, slamming the door and pressing our bodies
against it. He thudded past, not stopping.


We went back to our beds. Some of us tried to sleep

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The door opened — too softly to be him — and
there she was, very pale except for the ugly bruises
covering the right side of her face.


"Put on your coats, we're leaving."


All of us, even the boy, were ready in scant seconds,
not even stopping to wonder where we were going,
just grateful that finally we would all be safe. We crept
through the kitchen and out the back door, careful not
to alert the monster on the couch. Our mother had no
more words for us; she just led us in a raggedy line
down the street.


We walked for a long time. There was a song popular
on the radio then, "A Place in the Sun," and I kept
humming the words quietly to myself as we trudged
on. The streets of the suburb were almost deserted; we
passed few people on our strange parade.


As the night wore on, I began to suspect we were
walking in circles, but I said nothing. We came to a
park, one of the boring kind with no swings or slides,
only benches, and we scattered ourselves around, glad
to rest for a while. I watched my mother from the corner
of my eye, suspecting the truth: there was nowhere
for us to go, no one to run to. I heard her mumble
something, and watched as she rose and picked up the
boy, who was dead on his feet, to carry him. We
followed her, and soon realized she was taking us back
home. All of us walked very slowly.

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When we reached the house, she tried the side door
and found it locked, so she took us around, into the
backyard.


"Please, just lie down on the grass, try your best to
sleep."


There was a terrible weariness, a worse defeat, in her
voice. We lay down with no protest. The ground was
rough and damp from the earlier rain. She took off her
coat and laid it down for the boy to sleep on.


We were quiet enough that we heard him unlock
the back door, heard him open it just enough to let us
know it was open.


Then silence again.


Our mother's voice was filled with pain, and
something else I could not recognize.


"All right children, get up. We're going back in."

Someone was at my door, calling and
knocking to rouse me. I jerked out of bed,
where I had spent a restless night anticipating this
interview. Finding my glasses safely stashed on the window
ledge, I yelled out I'd be right there. I combed my
hair in frantic strokes, noticing how my hand shook. I
opened the door to the welfare worker, an impatient,
well-dressed woman about my own age who clutched
an expensive-looking briefcase.


"P-please come in," I stuttered, finally faced with
the reality I'd been dreaming about.

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Not introducing herself, she followed me into my
room, pointedly looking around for a chair. I reddened,
gestured apologetically to the bed. For a week
now I had been sleeping on top of the blanket to avoid
seeing the bugs I was sure ate through the mattress
every night, so the bed looked made, though crumpled.
The stains and cigarette burns seemed to stand
out more than usual. She pursed her lips, staring at the
bed for long seconds, then gingerly lowered herself,
keeping the briefcase on her knees, snapping it open,
pulling out forms and a pen.


I sat as far away from her as I could manage at the
head of the narrow, metal-framed bed against one flat
pillow, my knees drawn up almost to my chest. I was
already intimidated, already feeling blameworthy for
my surroundings.


"Your complete name, please."


A rush of preliminary questions, answered
automatically.


"Married?"


"Separated."


"Children?"


"No."


"Why were you hospitalized?"


"Depression."


"How long were you hospitalized?"


"Three months, eleven days."


"Was this your first hospitalization?"


"No."


She talked like the form read.

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Please list all your hospitalizations, last to first, with
dates."


I noticed I was actually wringing my hands, her
refusal to make eye-contact, her palpable disapproval
rocking me. I was certain it could only escalate.


"I, I have trouble with time, with dates. I've been in
about seven times."


"Approximate dates!" she snapped.


I stumbled through, making up those I could not
recall. Anything to keep her hand moving, her voice
— accusatory and chilling — silent. She catalogued my
failures, she wrote them down.


"Have you ever worked?"


"Yes, of course. Four years, in Montreal, as a group-home
mother."


"Name of employer?"


Nothing had moved so fast for days. Her barrage of
questions left me breathless. Before I could think, could
add something that would speak of me, the person, she
was rising, energetically brushing the back of her dress
where it had come into contact with the blanket.


"Fine." I was looking at the back of her head as she
hurried out of the room. "Your cheque should be here
within the week." And she was gone, leaving a trail of
perfume.


I stood there, motionless, for some time, staring after
her. I had counted on being recognized as different,
being assured that this was the wrong place for me.


Time passed. I crept down to the second-floor
washroom and stared at my reflection in the cloudy

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I spend hours piling bricks upon bricks,
first in front of the thin plywood door, floor to
ceiling, then against the wall facing me while my
mind drifts in a fugue state, playing endless variations
on unformed ideas. I can feel the texture of each imaginary
brick, each slowly blistering fingertip.


I don't stop, don't come back to vulnerable plaster,
except when I leave the room to use the second-floor
bathroom, an ugly precursor to the rest of the house. I
haven't extinguished the bare bulb in my room since I
moved into the house. Now I'm afraid it will burn out,
leave me alone in the dark, at the mercy of scurrying
things.


I try desperately not to think, not to feel, but there
are memories and questions I can't block. The frustration
of looking for a sheltered place to live. Being
turned away from two women's residences because
they'd already reached their quota of ex-psychiatric
patients. Not knowing where else to look on my scant
income. The nurse looking up a phone number, calling.

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Hello. I'm calling for a young woman who will
shortly be discharged from our hospital ward. She
needs a place to stay, and I was wondering if you had
any empty beds?" She was smiling so happily as she
turned to me, glad to have found me a place.


"He does have an empty bed. You can move in on
the thirtieth." I keep seeing that smile, feeling her
warmth.


I also remember before that — flashes of brightly lit
corridors, medicinal smells, glimpses of faces.


The hospital's occupational therapy room was a
jumble of craft materials and tools: leather, wool,
needles, paints, posters and scissors. It was a small
room, easily crowded by the tranquillized patients as
they were herded up from the psychiatric ward. Some
were drawing, others breaking bits of tile and gluing
them onto ashtray forms. Some were just staring
blankly ahead, oblivious of where they were.


The twenty-four-hour constant-observation staff
assigned to me, my "constant," would ease off her
watch in here, feeling, I suppose, that it was a contained,
safe place, with other staff available to keep an
eye on me. Making my way to the supply cabinet was
not hard or a cause for suspicion, though my heart beat
loudly enough to give me away. In one box, I had
noticed before, was a large, vicious-looking pair of scissors,
just waiting for someone like me. I poked around
with one hand while the other lifted the scissors, jamming
them deep inside my housecoat pocket. I was
sure, as I made my way back to the table, that some

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A half hour later, back in my room on the ward, I
went to the small table by the bed and, keeping my
back to the constant, managed to extract the scissors
from my pocket and hide them beneath the few items I
had salvaged from my former life. My escape route
intact, I already felt better, almost light-headed. I was
cheerfully friendly to the woman whose job it was to
stay within inches of me, instead of glaring at her
resentfully as had been my practice. I even experienced
a brief flash of guilt, thinking, if I succeeded, she might
lose her job.


Since there was no telling when the missing scissors
might be reported, I knew I had to act that night or lose
the opportunity. I hoped that my night constant would
be a sleeper; they varied from painfully conscientious to
those who snored so loudly our roles were reversed and
I ended up watching them, unable to sleep.


I'd had this one before: she always looked as though
she'd already done a twenty-four-hour shift before
coming to me. She sat by the door, about five feet
from my bed, in order to take advantage of the hall
light. On her lap was a pile of <i>True Romance</i> magazines.
I feigned sleep, hoping to encourage her to drop off,
and ran through my options behind closed eyelids as I
listened to paper rustle. Every half hour or so, the floor
nurse would click her way down the hall, into each

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What's the matter, dear?"


"It's okay, I just remembered something I'd like to
write down."


I got out of bed and, with my back to her, rummaged
around in the table drawer, managing once
again to get the scissors into my pocket. I closed the
drawer and turned to face her, looking a little puzzled.


"Now I've forgotten what I wanted to write down
... well, it'll come back to me. I'll just sit up for a few
minutes."


She smiled, hiding her annoyance that I was awake
and thereby requiring her attentiveness. I perched on
my bed, facing away from her, looking out the window
into the night. I stayed motionless until I heard the
pages turning again.


My movements masked by darkness, I got the scissors
out of my pocket, and, clutching the handles in
both hands, pushed the tip hard just over my navel. I
closed my eyes, trying to regulate my breathing, trying
to find the inner strength to break through the barrier
of flesh that kept me chained to hospitals, to life. I
pushed steadily harder, getting cold, very cold. I was
no longer aware whether I had succeeded or not. My
mind was already far, far away. There was a pulsing
noise from somewhere.

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I heard her voice, the floor nurse's voice. It seemed
to come from a distance, and yet was close. I twisted
my head to the side — my body was rigid and non-responsive
— and saw her standing inches from the
foot of my bed.


"Pat, what are you doing?"


I heard, again from a distance, the magazine drop to
the floor, the legs of the constant's chair scrape back.


Not now, I thought wearily.


"Even if you were able to stab yourself before I
could reach you, Pat, this is a hospital, filled with doctors,
operating rooms.... You wouldn't die, you'd
only cause yourself unnecessary pain. Please, give it to
me."


I couldn't speak. I was still somewhere else, though
anger, shame and frustration were bringing me back far
too fast. Her hands were on mine now, prying my fingers
from the scissors.


They gave me pills to sleep. My psychiatrist was
woken up at home, my constant changed.


All that determination to keep me alive.


Now, surrounded by the imagined brick walls in my
boarding house room, it all made sense. Why I hadn't
been able to get better, in spite of taking the pills they
prescribed and attending the mind-numbing out-
patient programs, in spite of the three months in the
Toronto hospital. Why, when I'd started, just started,
to feel there were still possibilities, that was abruptly
ripped out of my life the moment I walked into this
house. Of course, there would be more sadistic

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The welfare worker's indifference collapsed the last
thin hope I'd held like a shield between me and an
escalating certainty that I was precisely where I was
meant to be. A week had already passed in this third-floor
room, I'd left only for meals and to use the bathroom,
hating the need to risk myself in the hallway, or
on the darkened flight of stairs, dreading coming face
to face with any other tenants.


I was struggling to define for myself what was real
and what was not, moving closer and closer to the realization
that what I had tried to dismiss as delusion was
in fact true. I no longer made any effort to remind
myself that, each time I got sick, I would feel the same
foreboding, this surrounding awareness that the usually
benign God I believed in had become a very different
entity, manifesting many of the worst features of my
own father. The knowledge that this was a patently
Freudian twist has generally enabled me to argue
against the evidence, but now, alone, I had no
arguments left. And I was certain that in this metamorphosis,
God was single-mindedly obsessed with
my personal abasement and destruction.


I was so certain of who was behind my being here
that I never thought of just walking out, although it
was doubtful anyone would have even noticed I was
gone. There were no guards, no locks on the front
door. One phone call would have taken me back to

There was little comfort for me in that room during
the first long week, except for the knowledge that I'd
fought a good fight against impressive odds in the
eleven years since my first hospitalization; I'd made a
difference in the lives of some people, done some
good. If I could only have felt assured that dying
wouldn't bring an eternity of damnation, I wouldn't
have feared it or regretted the ending.


There was no day or night for me that first week. I
lived in waking dreams and nightmares, a very private
madness in a house where madness was the norm.

In the years following my first hospitalization
and my first explorations into myself, I
determined to become someone I could live with,
if not, in the words of the therapist, someone I could
love. My first efforts were based on my blanket acceptance
that I wasn't a very good person, and that I
should change those parts of myself that could be
changed. I hadn't yet realized that I'd simply internalized
all the verbal assaults that characterized the
first eighteen years of my life.

The way I chose to effect change was not the most
constructive or safe method. I self-prescribed judicious
amounts of LSD daily for over a year, not for partying
with my peers, but to take me on solitary excursions
into myself, to force an opening up, a sensitization that
I felt would reduce the selfishness and destructiveness
that were the main elements of my character.


I experienced a mish-mash of revelations about
myself, my motivations and my continuing depression,
culled from psychology texts, psychotherapy sessions,
anti-psychiatry tracts and my own drug-induced
insights. Although I believed at the time that I possessed
all the awareness I needed to make conscious
decisions and choices in my life, in retrospect there
were a lot of gaps. But my experiences as a student
activist helped me to decide that fighting for change
when change was needed, standing up for people who
were nervous about the consequences of standing up
for themselves, helped me to expiate a lot of the guilt I
carried, guilt shared by most abused children, for not
preventing the violence the six of us had suffered.
Going head to head with a college administrator or
professor over an issue helped me rework my self-image
from that of a cowardly individual into a person
who simply wouldn't take abuse from anyone, no matter
what their position. I felt I was saved from feeling
arrogant or superior about this because of the absence
of altruistic motives. I also enjoyed the complexities of
politics, compromise, even professorial mind-games. I
came to realize that having some cause or some issue I

I'd never felt crazy. The depression was too obviously
a justified reaction to reality for me to get
worried about my sanity. Even my frequent and imaginative
suicide attempts were a logical result of bad
beginnings. People get used to chronic health problems.
I felt I could simply work around mine, at least
till this last year; the year all the rules changed.
