Suddenly there appeared a new patient She was rushed
down from surgery. She had tried to commit suicide. As a
result a tracheotomy had to be performed so she could
breathe. She was also assigned to Dr. Schoen.


I felt little jealousy here, for which I was thankful. This

When this patient had quieted down somewhat I approached
her with the usual question. "What brings you to
the psychiatric ward?"


"I tried to commit suicide," she answered.


"Why did you try to do this?"


"I was in love with an intern, and he threw me over for
another nurse."


"Oh," I said knowingly, "sex is part of your problem too."


"No, sex isn't," she exclaimed, "because I have been
getting plenty of sex with this boy, you see."


"Couldn't you win him back?" I asked naÃ¯vely.


"He wants nothing to do with me now. He won't even
come to see how sick I am."


"You really don't seem sick enough to be here."


"Dr. Schoen seems to think that I am."


"Dr. Schoen thinks everyone is sick in this world but
himself."


"I rather like him," the new patient said.


"He's really the best doctor in the hospital. He gets all
the patients where shock or insulin is not required."


"I don't want any shock or insulin treatments, and, anyway,
I intend to finish killing myself as soon as I can get out
of this place."


"You're the third nurse who has been in this ward, and
there have been two doctors in the clinic."


"Where did you see the doctors?"


"At occupational therapy and at the dances. I rather fell
in love with one of the doctors. He paid me attention for a
while, but when he became ready for discharge he didn't
seem to remember me at all. We both had Dr. Schoen for
our doctor, and we both talked to Dr. Schoen about the
other. Anyone who is a friend of Dr. Schoen is a friend of
mine."


"Same here," the patient said.


It was time for lunch.

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048387-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After lunch I did not see the new patient. Already missing
her somewhat, I busied myself crocheting another triangular
rug. Tiring of this, I decided to spend the remainder
of the afternoon at painting the forest of trees in which I
seemed to be lost.


I had hardly begun to paint, when one of the attendants
came to me and asked whether I had seen the new patient.
I told her that I had been with this patient earlier in the
day, but that I had not seen her since lunch.


Suddenly I was aware of a frantic searching on the part
of the attendants. They were searching for the new patient,
who had been missing since lunch.


Dr. Schoen entered the ward, looking disturbed, then
hastened out again. Several hours passed. The attendants
were in a huddle on one side of the ward.


Dr. Schoen entered the ward again, clutching the new
patient by the arm. It seemed that he was always leading
disobedient patients back into the ward. He hurried this one
to solitary confinement.


"What happened?" I asked of one of the attendants.


"She stole the keys from the supervisor and unlocked the
door. They found her back in her dormitory room. She had
a whole package of razor blades. She was going to make another
suicide attempt."


"But I had talked with her all morning. She did not tell
me anything about that," I mused, and continued, "Oh, yes,
she did say that as soon as she was free she would make another
attempt."


"She won't get another chance," the attendant said. "She
won't get out again until she is cured."


The next day Dr. Schoen came to tell me that it was time
for me to be placed in another ward. Perhaps my behavior
had indeed made him aware that I was on the mend.
