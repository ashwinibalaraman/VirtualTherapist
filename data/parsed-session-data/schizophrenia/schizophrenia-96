<i>I</i>t's late August and the day is sunny and warm.
A cool breeze blows gently across my face and it feels
good. It's only a ten minute walk to the Gloucester Station,
but Ma and her friend walk so slowly it seems we'll never
get there. It's an hour's train ride from Gloucester to
Boston where my new residence--St. Therese's Home for
Girls--is located. I'm really looking forward to a new
environment. I wonder what St. Therese's will be like and
if the Sisters who run it will be kind. Maybe the place will
be gloomy and I won't like it. From the train we take a
street car. I'm still anticipating St. Therese's when we stop.
I can't believe what I see.


On the side of the road are beautiful homes that look like
estates of the wealthy. Carefully manicured lawns encircle
each house and huge, tall elms line the street. Across the
road is a large graceful pond. It reminds me of a picture
postcard. Can one of these houses be the "Home"? When
the conductor shouts, "St. Therese's!" I'm overjoyed.
Right now life seems really good to me.


St. Therese's is just as beautiful inside as it appears from
the outside. Ma and her friend speak to each other quietly

The first staff person I come to know at St. Therese's is
the Sister Superior, Sister Clara. She's so cheerful. We all
want to be with her; her infectious smile and enthusiasm
make us feel good. All the girls respect her; she's dedicated
to her work and involved with each of us personally. Sister
Clara's a disciplinarian, but for me in a new way--she's
firm but also fair. I don't fear her and can only marvel
at--and be grateful for--the difference between her and
Pa. Most important, I discover Sister Clara sincerely loves
all the girls--and I come to love her too. My memories of
her are with me even today, strong, clear, and nourishing.


Fifteen girls are living at the Home, most either
orphaned or from broken homes. We are all of high school
age and upon graduation are not allowed to remain. I make
close friends with two of the girls almost immediately and
get along very well with most of the others. A sense of
camaraderie exists among us, and we enjoy the usual
boarding school pranks, like throwing someone in the
shower fully clothed. At night, Sister Clara goes from
room to room wishing us a goodnight and dousing us with
Holy Water as we lie under the covers giggling.

Our daily routine is very relaxed. We begin with a
mandatory Mass at 6:30 A.M. After breakfast each girl
makes her bed, straightens out her room, and completes a
chore such as cleaning a bathroom or helping prepare
meals. The worst part of preparing meals is peeling potatoes.
No matter how much we clean them Sister always
finds a spot we missed. I often wonder why potatoes are
such an important part of our diet!


In good weather, we spend our leisure time outside,
playing croquet or badminton. There are picnic tables set
up where we can have our lunch. The grounds are spacious
with secluded spots where we can sit quietly. During
bad weather we spend our time in a recreation room
on the top floor, listening to music on the phonograph,
sitting around, sewing, talking. During the school
months, the recreation room is used as a study hall where,
after supper, we all sit quietly, doing our homework. All
of our time is spent either at the Home or at school--
we are allowed to go into town only when absolutely
necessary. Though the rules are strict, I'm happy at St.
Therese's.


At St. Therese's I attend St. Mary's Academy, a private
girls' school whose students come primarily from middle
class Catholic families. I really enjoy St. Mary's, and make
friends with Sister Nicky, my English teacher. Sister
Nicky is a tiny woman in her early thirties with a big heart
and a warm smile. Pa gave me a love of literature; Sister
Nicky helps my interest blossom. Under her influence I
begin reading the works of Shakespeare, Shelley, and
Emily Dickinson. Sister becomes my confidante, and our
friendship continues after I leave the Academy. Five years
after my departure, I lose contact with Sister Nicky--I
miss her terribly, for she was my best friend.

But I don't do well academically at the Academy, and
the Sisters at St. Therese's are disappointed, especially Sister
Clara. She feels that I have special abilities and don't
work up to my potential. Though I enjoy St. Therese's I do
miss Ma and Pa. I also miss my few friends back in
Gloucester. Yet, I don't want to return to Gloucester--all
I think of is how unhappy I'd been there. Sister Clara gives
me permission to work part-time at Presbyterian Hospital
as a nurse's aide and my work there, together with school,
keeps me busy, giving me less time to brood. My first job!
Trying to fulfill its requirements shows me how immature
I really am.


At the end of my junior year at the Academy, Pa
requests that I come home to visit. Things go smoothly,
but the old fears are still there and I know they always will
be. When I'm preparing to return to St. Therese's, Pa
speaks to me, "We wish you were home again. Won't you
come back and live here again?" I'm still afraid of Pa and
his question has the force of an order. But I know my
mind. Still it takes all my courage to say no. I see Pa
standing beside me with his head bowed. He's crying--
and trying not to. I don't know what to do. He seems
weak--I don't know him that way. Then I feel compassion
for him, and sorrow. I'm tempted to change my mind. My
feelings are very strong and I don't know why I don't alter
my decision. But I return to St. Therese's after only two
weeks at home.


A few weeks later, Sister Clara informs me that Pa won't
pay my board any longer. She suggests that I return home.
I'm stunned! I didn't realize how badly Pa wanted me
home. I thought both Ma and Pa were resigned to the fact
that I wouldn't return. During my two years at St.
Therese's I've visited Gloucester only a few times, and Ma

My job at the Presbyterian Hospital doesn't go well and
I don't stay too long. I enjoy the work and the nurses are
helpful but I'm frequently depressed, and those episodes,
which last longer and longer, interfere with my work. I'm
absent for days at a time and many times, while at work, I
have to leave because I can't do the work assigned to me.
All I want to do is lie in bed and sleep. I lose weight and
suffer from persistent colds. I feel very sorry for myself; it
seems that nobody cares what I do and that I have no roots.
At seventeen I feel totally unprepared for the task of supporting
myself. The supervisor at the hospital finally suggests
that I leave the job and see a social worker at the
public welfare agency in Boston. I relent.


When I meet Mrs. Lancaster, the social worker at the
agency, I have no job, no money, and lots of self-pity. I
expect her to perform miracles and give me instant happiness,
but her simple kindness proves enough. Mrs. Lancaster
arranges for me to live at the Weston Street Home,
a residence for indigent women. Most of the women there
are mothers with babies who are waiting for apartments.
The Weston Street Home is an unpleasant brick building
located in one of the poorest neighborhoods of Boston. It
has very large rooms with faded grey walls and brown
metal stairs with iron banisters. Meals are served in a

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At Weston Street, I meet Ginny, an eighteen year old
with long blond hair and blue eyes. Ginny always has a
smile on her face even when things are going badly for her.
We become friends.


One afternoon, Ginny and I go for a walk in the park.
The summer sun feels good as we walk along, chattering
nonstop. We're both disillusioned with Weston Street, and
it doesn't take much talking for us to decide to leave the
Home and take a trip to New York. At that time it was
unheard of that teenagers, especially girls, would hitchhike,
particularly out of state. Ginny and I are implusive
when we decide to go--all common sense is outweighed
by the excitement such a trip promises.


At six P.M. we get a ride with a truck driver who agrees
to take us as far as he's going--New York. We travel all
night, singing songs at the top of our voices. My depression
leaves; I feel free and happy. Putting my past behind
me, I don't give one thought to what I'll do when we reach
New York. I just don't care.


By morning, tired and hungry, we have passed the outskirts
of New York and, unknowingly, bypassed the city
as well. The truck lets us off and we start to walk along the
highway. We come to a dirt road and follow it for about a
mile. When it ends, we are left speechless. We gaze across
a valley filled with every shade of green imaginable, all
blended beautifully. The grass is a velvet plane and the
mountains lie serenely around us. It's the most beautiful

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We stand awhile in awe of the view before heading back
to the highway. A car stops and two state troopers get out.
We become very confused and have difficulty answering
their questions. But they're friendly enough and take us
back to the police barracks and feed us. We calm down, so
that when the trooper arrests us for hitchhiking and
vagrancy and takes us to the local police station, we aren't
even upset.


The police station is relatively small with three spotless
cells. Ginny and I are placed in the same cell so that we
won't be frightened. We sing songs until early morning,
stopping only for refreshments or to tell each other jokes.
I'm not worried about anything. We're living just for the
moment, making the most of a bad situation.


Later that day we're released and given train tickets to
Boston. The train ride is uneventful, but I feel the old
depression coming back again. The elation of the previous
two days has left me and I feel confused by my past actions.
I'm also worried about what I'll do when I get to Boston.


I go back to the Weston Street Home, but during the
week my depression becomes more severe. My head feels
as if a tight band is wrapped around it, and my body is so
leaden that it becomes difficult to move. I spend most of
my time lying on my bed either daydreaming or crying.
How useless everything is. I no longer feel a part of the life
around me and the more isolated I feel the more I isolate
myself. My appetite's gone and I have no interest in anything,
not even in reading which has always been a pleasant
way of escaping my sadness. There's nothing more for me
to do. In despair, I try to take my life, setting my clothes

Mrs. Lancaster is alarmed at my condition. In her office
I mention the fire I set to my clothes. I just want to cry, I'm
so unhappy--but I'm also so tired and deadened, that I
can't even feel my face as my own, and tears are in some
distant place.


"Marie, tell me what's wrong," she asks, her eyes
searching for an answer.


I remain silent, drooped into the chair.


"Marie, I think you'll have to go to the hospital ...
you're sick and need help."


Mrs. Lancaster's words come to me, but they're empty
and they make no sense. I can't imagine what a hospital can
do for someone like me since I'm not physically sick. But
Mrs. Lancaster is so insistent that I decide to follow her to
the hospital a block away.
