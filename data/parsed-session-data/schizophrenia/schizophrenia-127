No.


Nonononononon....


"Your brother...."


"JESUS...."


"...writes a damn good...."


"...you scared me...."


"...letter. Wish he'd send <i>me</i> one. I never get letters."


I jumped, jolted back into the present by my skinny friend Stan.
He'd materialized out of the darkness, my backpack in hand like a
peace offering.


"Jesus. How'd you know I was here?"

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I looked everywhere else. I had to give you back your letters.
Plus I come here all the time. Thought you might, too."


"Here" was somewhere I used to go when I was a student: the
bleachers out by the football field. Ironic that I'd barely ever gone to
a football game there, but I loved the mystery after the game, the
trampled grass and the crisp air, the darkness that high up, the fantasy
of meeting up with a lonely, sensitive football jock looking for
love. (It never happened. I guess that's why they call it a fantasy.)
From the top row of seats, you had a 360-degree view of the entire
campus, of Sherman, of the world. Tim had told me he used to
come here as well, but he wasn't here now, and he hadn't been anywhere
in Baker Hall, the closest dorm, where Tim and I had both
lived, in separate rooms.


I'd gone there after my swimming pool fight with Stan. The main
doors had combination locks on them, but a student held one open
for me. It was surprisingly easy to get into; it continually amazed me
how easy it was to get into <i>any</i> building on campus. No wonder they
had break-ins.


No wonder people got raped.


I'd wandered up to Tim's second-floor dorm room, the one he
had thrown an alarm clock out of, just to hear the sound of glass
breaking, when he had his breakdown. But it was one of the few
things that <i>was</i> locked; I couldn't get in, to look for my brother there.
After I took a little tour of duty—past the three different dorm
rooms I'd had, past the phone booth where I got the news of Tim's
breakdown—I headed out to the stadium for a final good-bye. It was
near the parking lot where I'd stowed my rental car, close enough for
a quick getaway. Since it looked as if no fantasy jock was going to
show up to offer me his bed for the night, I'd grab a cheap motel
room and head back early in the morning, to the reality of my

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If I didn't <i>see</i> Tim missing, he <i>wasn't</i> missing.


And all I'd given up was one day, one crazy, jam-packed day when
I'd begun to experience life as a "twinless twin," as if twenty-eight
years of history had never even existed.


No brother, no fantasy jock, just little bobble-headed Stan,
reminding me I was breathing; and I was sitting there, and my heart
was still pumping in the present, not just the past, and life was really
going on, on a cool October night.


For once, I would apologize first.


"Listen, I'm sorry I snapped—"


"Don't worry, I understand."


"How could you? Some stranger goes off on you for no reason."


"And sometimes I wake up mean. I get it. No big whoop."


All was forgiven, so easily.


Oh Youth and Beauty....


"The letters...." Crunched down next to me, he opened the
backpack and took out a handful, then paused, lost in his own memories
of a stranger's letters.


"I've never read anything more beautiful. They should teach a
class here on 'em."


"‘Yeah,'Warning Signs of Going Nuts 101.’ Mandatory, like P.E."


"I was never very good at P.E., were you?"


"Disaster."


"My legs were so skinny in those shorts. Dodgeball. Ugh. And
taking showers with everybody...."


We both paused, lost in another set of memories. The night

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We could see our breath.


"Thanks for bringing them back. I didn't really mean to throw
them at you. They might be all I have left of him. That sounded
melodramatic, didn't it? I'd've tracked you down somehow, gotten
them before I left. Thanks for bringing them back," I said, standing
up, looking out over the campus.


"This is what he saw, the night he went crazy. I think it must be
close to that anniversary, when it happened. Somewhere around
now, 'round Halloween. Seven years ago. He started yelling and
crying and went crazy. Or maybe he'd already gone. He was just
making the announcement."


A figure just like me, same shape, same soft Texas accent, opening
his dorm room window and yelling out, except we were too
nervous. He didn't yell; I knew that much. He wanted to, he tried,
but it just came out a whisper. I knew that much without having
been there. People talked about it in the days afterward; everyone
had heard by then, but no one actually <i>heard</i>, heard him make noise,
heard the things he had said.


Just as I thought, it was a whimper, not a bang.


"I really did think he might have come back here, you know? Get
some crazy idea in his head, come back to the past. Me, too. Go a
little crazy, run away from the present, come back to the past. But it
was stupid. He's not here, or he'd show himself. What's the point of
hiding if nobody finds you? What's the point of cutting your wrist if
there's nobody to get back at and let them <i>know</i> you're getting back
at them?"


This kid, the night air, was bringing out all the truth in me, that I
didn't have anybody else to tell, now that Tim was gone.

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Maybe I just wanted to run away from really looking for him,
delay finding out for sure that...if..."


That he was dead?


I don't know.


"Ugh," I said, shaking it all away, "I've gotta get back home, look
for him there. He's not here."


"That's what I came to tell you. I know where he is."


<i>"What?"</i>


Stan, who'd been quiet for so long, was now almost busting with
pride at his discovery. "Mo Ranch. The Guadalupe River. That's
where he is. I figured it out from the letters. It's six hours, we take
turns driving, we get there before sun up. Road Trip! We'll stop for
snacks."


I laughed, even though it wasn't funny.


"You've gone as crazy as I have."


"I'm serious. I think that's where he is. It's all he talks about in
the letters. It's like they're clues, they're all there. I know clues. I
read every Nancy Drew there was. Twice." He looked at me, almost
begging. "You sleep. I'll drive. We'll stop at Dairy Queens and get
iced tea."


No.


The insanity had to stop somewhere.


After everything else I'd done today, I was not about to get in a
car with some kid who wanted to be Stanley Kowalski and drive all
night long. One wild-goose trip per lifetime was enough.


It's like he read my mind.


"Please. Just...you can't get back to New York tonight. What else
are ya gonna do? Sleep? Wait around? I've got this weird feeling
about this. It's where <i>I'd</i> go, if I was him."


Was it really that crazy? Mo Ranch is probably where I should

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Okay, I could rationalize that part of it, a trip to Mo Ranch. I'd
always wanted to see it; now I could, with or without my brother. It
would be the road trip I'd never taken in college, that my friends and
I had always weenied out on at the last minute, after the initial rush
to hop in a car and go to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. It would be
like reliving my past, only fixing it, making it better.


But none of those would-be trips involved a twenty-year-old kid
I had just met, that I'd so easily let in on the mysteries and intimacies
of twins, of breakdowns, of best friends who got hurt. Where
did Stan fit into this: what did <i>he</i> want? Earlier, at dinner, it was perfectly
innocent: he'd said he really needed help figuring out what to
do when he graduated. Should he go to grad school, or straight to
New York? Could he really make it as an actor? How hard was it
to find an apartment there? What kinds of jobs could you get? How
much did it cost to live, if his parents would even let him go there.
All the practical, how-to stuff I wish somebody had answered for me
when I first moved there.


All well and good, if more appropriate for dinner conversation, or
a college seminar with a bunch of other students, than suitable for
an all-night drive, alone, in the dark.


Maybe he didn't know what he really wanted from me any more
than I knew what I wanted from him. Was he really just somebody
to drive, to talk to, to keep me awake? An aspiring actor, a captive,
willing audience for six hours? Or was there something else I was
unwilling, or too uncomfortable, to admit? Something like this had

I closed my eyes, so I wouldn't see it.


If I didn't see it, it wasn't there.


I'm not even sure what "it" was.


"You win. What do we do now?"


"We go to the river."
