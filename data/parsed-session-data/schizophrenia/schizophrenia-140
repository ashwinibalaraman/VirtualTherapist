<b>A</b>FTER I was robbed of my letter and several
pages of my history, Mr. Nuckles
kept me confined in my cell and would
not let me out. He left the place for a
few days, and, as I have already stated,
I was left in the keeping of young Massingale.
He and an old man by the name of Steadmire
came in one day to clean up the cell, which it is

Soon after I had been placed there, Davis, or
Dr. Friday as I called him, would come into my

Mr. Thomas Nee Smith was a singular case. He
said he went deranged on purpose. He was quite
a young man, lived in Culman County, had a wife
and one child, and was raised in Culman County,
originally Winston. His father and eldest brother
had joined the Federal army during the war. His
father died in a hospital in Nashville, Tennessee.
He had a brother in the asylum, and also a sister
had been there, but was then at home still insane.
He was brought there some time after I went
there. Was put in the eighth ward, where they
put all maniacs. He had an open countenance
and was a good-looking man. He heard some one
call me “parson” and told me he was a Methodist,

Next night he told me he would not be alive in
the morning, that he was determined to butt his

I never felt so sorry for a man as I did when
they locked him in his cell. He cried for his dear
little wife and child and old widowed mother. It
was heart-rending to hear his cries. One day
while we were in the hall he took hold of the iron
door or grate at the west end and would have been
out in a minute if I had not called for help. He
had to be locked in his cell nearly all the time to
prevent his escape. He came very near breaking
out the grate of the wash-room by punching it
with a bench. He got hold of a hammer one day
and wanted a young man to go with him to the
attendants' room and knock Mr. Jones in the head
while he was asleep, get his keys, and make his
escape. His whole time was taken up devising
plans of escape. Poor man! he had sinned against
God and his own body, and no wonder he was in
trouble.


Mr. Hall, the wardmaster of the fifth ward,
was a very nice man, and I think a member of the
Baptist Church. He lived near by the asylum,
and on our walks we passed his house. He had

When I first went to the hospital, Mr. Parish,
one of the patients, formed quite a friendship for
me. My health was very poor and I could not
eat one half my rations. He complained of not
