<font size="4"><b>Crisis Intervention</b></font>

Many questions have been raised about the role of
school psychologists in crisis intervention (i.e., strategies
to use in a crisis) over the last two decades.
Poland and Pitcher (1992) emphasized the need for
schools to be prepared for violence that might come
from outside the school, such as a violent act committed
by a disturbed adult. The highly publicized
school shootings that occurred in the mid-to-late
1990s, including the mass murders at Columbine
High School, highlight the fact that school safety is an
inside job requiring a commitment first of all from
students, as the majority of the recent violent acts at
schools have been committed by student perpetrators.
There has been an increased level of emphasis on
crisis training for school psychologists in recent years
(Poland &amp; colleagues, 2002) and the National Association
of School Psychologists (NASP) has provided
leadership at both the state and national level.


NASP formed the National Emergency Assistance
Team (NEAT) in 1996 with an emphasis on advocacy,
training, and emergency mobile response. The team
received a great deal of publicity for providing on-site
assistance following school shootings in locations
such as Paducah, Jonesboro, Littleton, Springfield,
and El Cajon.


NASP also formed very strong alliances with the
National Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA)
and the U.S. Department of Education. NOVA is best
known for its Community Response Teams that are
sent when requested to communities that have experienced
a crisis, whether it is the result of a violent act
or a natural disaster.


Many workshops have been conducted at both the
state and national levels to increase both the skills and
confidence of school psychologists to respond to a crisis.
A number of state school psychology associations
(e.g., Florida, Georgia, Colorado, and California) have
formed their own crisis teams. NASP is also currently
working on training standards for crisis intervention.


After Columbine the U.S. Department of Education
developed Project SERV (School Emergency Response
to Violence). Project SERV has provided both
short- and long-term assistance to schools after a crisis,
including sending members of the NEAT for initial
assistance as well as providing funds through grants
to hire additional counselors and to create prevention
programs.


School psychologists are skilled in conducting
processing sessions or debriefing for faculty and
students after a tragedy. Poland and colleagues (2002)
emphasized the importance of these skills for school
psychologists and the reality that one processing
model will not fit every situation; therefore, adaptations
often need to be made. There have been a number
of research studies on the effectiveness of processing
interventions, and, although participants overwhelmingly
reported that they were beneficial, the research
has not consistently demonstrated benefits.


STATISTICS AND SCHOOL CRISES


The final report of the Safe School Initiative from the
U.S. Secret Service and the Department of Education
(Vossekuil &amp; colleagues, 2002), emphasized that:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• The number of violent deaths on school grounds
has decreased, and the average for the past 10
years has been 33 deaths per year.
</p>

years has been 33 deaths per year.


• Schools are the safest place for children.


• More than 99% of youth homicides occur in the
home, neighborhood, or community.



[p. <i>128</i>]

• The majority of school shootings committed
by student perpetrators were motivated by
revenge and planned over a long period of time,
and friends were told of the school shooters'
homicidal plans.


CRISIS PLANNING


The September 11, 2001, attacks also have many
significant implications for crisis planning in the
schools. School administrators have made significant
improvements in crisis planning in recent years and
there is a wealth of materials available to assist them.


<b>School Psychologist's
Role in Crisis Planning</b>


School psychologists can play a key role in crisis
planning to not only assist schools to manage the
waves of emotionality following a crisis but also the
police, medical workers, media personnel, and parents
who rush to a school after a crisis. Poland and
McCormick (2000) outlined roles for support personnel
that vary from architect of the crisis plan to consultant,
and from direct service provider to those
directly affected. They also indicated that prevention
programs should reduce bullying and increase student
reporting of weapons and violent threats on campus.


A THEORETICAL
FRAMEWORK FOR CRISIS PLANNING


School crisis planning is a broad area, and starting
with a theoretical model is essential. Caplan (1964)
developed a well-known model that emphasizes three
levels of crisis intervention. This framework has been
expanded with regard to the schools and encompasses
all areas of crisis planning (Pitcher &amp; Poland, 1992).
Schools must develop crisis plans at all three of the
following levels:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. <i>Primary prevention</i> consists of activities
devoted to preventing a crisis from occurring. A
few examples are conflict resolution, gun safety,
safe driving, suicide prevention programs, and
training school personnel in first aid and CPR.
School psychologists are in a key position to
initiate prevention programs that reduce leading
causes of death.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. <i>Secondary intervention</i> includes steps taken in
the immediate aftermath of a crisis to minimize
effects and escalation. Examples are evacuating
students to a safe place away from danger and
reopening the school as quickly as possible after
a crisis.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. <i>Tertiary intervention</i> involves providing longterm
follow-up assistance to those who have
experienced a severe crisis. Examples are monitoring
and supporting the friends of a suicide
victim for a year after the suicide and adding
support personnel such as counselors after a
school shooting. Research has clarified that
adolescents in particular who have been traumatized
are increasingly at risk for substance
abuse, reckless behavior, and suicide.

and supporting the friends of a suicide
victim for a year after the suicide and adding
support personnel such as counselors after a
school shooting. Research has clarified that
adolescents in particular who have been traumatized
are increasingly at risk for substance
abuse, reckless behavior, and suicide.


School personnel often view crisis intervention as
having only one level, secondary intervention. For
example, at a high school tragedy in which an assistant
principal was shot by a student during lunch in
the cafeteria, students and staff members described in
great detail their thoughts and actions in the immediate
aftermath of the shooting. However, the critical
need for additional assistance for faculty and students,
and the importance of prevention activities designed
to reduce the incidence of weapons at school were
initially met with some resistance. The crisis had presented
an excellent opportunity to create prevention
programs and develop crisis teams designed to
improve the school's ability to respond to such events.
All schools experience some type of crisis event.
When a crisis occurs at a school, the school administrators
should review with a critical eye how the event
was handled, carefully noting what worked and what
did not work. Schools should anticipate any additional
types of crises that might occur and formulate plans to
deal with them, and it is especially important today
that schools not be left out of homeland security planning.
Schools must work closely with local and state
authorities and must take added security measures
when the national threat level increases.


ORGANIZING CRISIS TEAMS


Schools must look at their own resources and then
use one of the following three options as teams are
organized:

[p. <i>129</i>]

1. A building team in which every member works
in the same building. The advantages are that
team members are acquainted with each other
and they can easily meet to review crisis plans.
This approach works well when a school is large
enough to have campus personnel in key positions
(e.g., nurse, counselor, psychologist, and
security).


2. A district team in which all members are
employed by the school district, but they are
located in various buildings throughout the district.
This arrangement makes communication
and crisis planning more difficult than in a
building approach. A counselor or nurse may
need to cover several locations, and the psychologist
may need to be called from the central
office. It is important that the team include a
representative from each high school, because
statistics clearly indicate that after a crisis, high
school students are more at risk for violent,
suicidal, and accidental deaths.


3. A combination district and community team in
which some team members are district employees
and others (e.g., medical personnel, mental
health workers, or police officers) are employed
by community agencies. This format is more
difficult to organize, but it is essential in many
small and rural school districts in order to
develop a comprehensive plan. A school district
should never be in the position of establishing
relations with outside agencies <i>after</i> a crisis has
occurred.


Planning meetings should be scheduled and should
include representatives from all the agencies that will
be involved. Some schools have been frustrated by a
lack of response from community agencies; however,
it is important to note that involvement in the planning
process between local and state agencies and schools
has improved since 9/11/2001. Brock and Poland
(2002) discussed the difference between a centralized
and an on-site team. School or building teams are in
the best position to work on prevention, and centralized
or district teams can assist with intervention after
a crisis has occurred.


<b>Crisis Team Size and Membership</b>


The purpose of a crisis team is to incorporate sufficient
staff to delegate duties because it is impossible
for one administrator to do everything that is needed
in the aftermath of a crisis. There are school districts
with 20-member teams and 200-page crisis plans. But,
plans that are so lengthy that school personnel will not
review them on a regular basis are virtually useless.
The question of team size is an administrative as well
as commonsense one. Pitcher and Poland (1992) recommended
a team size of five to eight that includes:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Medical liaison
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Security liaison
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Parent liaison
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
4. Counseling liaison
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
5. Administrative liaison
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


1. Medical liaison


2. Security liaison


3. Parent liaison


4. Counseling liaison


5. Administrative liaison


This would result in a team of five, and these
liaisons could designate additional school staff
members to assist them. The addition of a media liaison
and a campus or staff liaison would be useful, but
the building principal may prefer to carry out these
duties rather than delegate them to someone else.


COPING WITH A DEATH OR TRAGEDY


Poland and McCormick (1999) cited governmental
figures that indicate that the number of deaths for
young people is at or near an all-time high. The leading
causes of death for children are, in order, accident,
homicide, and suicide. School personnel, especially
counselors, need to be aware of the developmental
stages of understanding death. The principal must verify
the death has occurred and then notify the faculty
through either a calling tree or faculty meeting, keeping
in mind the importance of giving school personnel
the opportunity to work through their own issues
about death and loss before having to assist their
students. If it is not possible to use either of these
notification methods, then the teachers should be
given hand-delivered memorandums that include specific
information as well as ideas about how to assist
their students. Teachers often appreciate having an
actual script written out for them, and Poland and
Poland (2004) developed a lesson plan that can be
used after a crisis. Pitcher and Poland (1992) developed
a tip sheet for teachers dealing with death. They
recommend an in-service training session designed
to empower teachers to help students by supporting
the expression of a range of emotions. Teachers can
provide various beneficial classroom activities for

[p. <i>130</i>]

• Geographic proximity, which is based on
physical distance of a person in relation to a
tragedy


• Social proximity, which is the degree of relationship
one has to the victim


• Population factors, which relate to the crisis
history of each individual and whether each
individual has experienced losses of significant
others in his or her life


• Psychological proximity, which is the degree
of identification an individual has to the crisis
incident or victim


School personnel, and especially teachers, need to
be informed about the circles of vulnerability as well
as the common reactions that children have to a
tragedy or crisis. Common reactions appear below:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Fears and worry about the future
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Regression academically and behaviorally
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Nightmares and sleeping difficulties
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Vulnerability to depression, substance abuse,
reckless behavior, and suicide, particularly in
adolescents

</table>

SUICIDE INTERVENTION


National interest in youth suicide prevention has
escalated as a result of the Surgeon General's Call to
Action to Prevent Suicide (U.S. Public Health
Service, 1999), and national suicide prevention strategies
have been developed that are to be implemented
by 2005. The Call to Action stressed three key components
of the study of the problem of suicide: awareness,
intervention, and methodology.


Suicide remains very rare for elementary children,
but suicidal thoughts and actions are very common for
adolescents. Bearman and Moody (2004) reported the
following for adolescents:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• 4% attempted suicide last year (2003).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• 20% knew a friend who attempted suicide last
year.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• 60% reported knowing an adolescent who
attempted suicide previously.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Social networks exert powerful influences on
adolescents; isolated adolescents who experience
peer conflict and lack of connection to
school are most at risk.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


• 4% attempted suicide last year (2003).


• 20% knew a friend who attempted suicide last
year.


• 60% reported knowing an adolescent who
attempted suicide previously.


• Social networks exert powerful influences on
adolescents; isolated adolescents who experience
peer conflict and lack of connection to
school are most at risk.


Recent research emphasizes that the suicide rate
for 10- to 14-year-old students has increased more
than 100% in the last decade, with the suicide rate for
older adolescents remaining more constant.


Schools have been slow in addressing the problem
of youth suicide, and a national grassroots parent effort
is helping schools and communities to increase prevention
efforts. One organization that is making a difference
is Yellow Ribbon, founded by suicide survivors.
Poland and McCormick (1999) documented that few
schools have training in suicide prevention or a plan
in place, and they cited a growing number of cases
in which schools have been subjected to lawsuits
after the suicide of a student. The key issue is not
whether the school somehow caused the suicide, but
whether the school failed to take reasonable steps to
prevent it. Schools have a responsibility to have prevention
programs in place, to foresee that a student who
is threatening suicide is at risk, to take steps to supervise
that student, and to obtain counseling assistance.
School personnel must also notify parents whenever
they have reason to believe that a student is suicidal.


All school personnel who interact with students
must be taught the warning signs of suicide and
empowered to follow procedures to alert the appropriate
personnel and get assistance for a suicidal student.
School psychologists and counselors are the logical
personnel to assess the severity level. It is very important
that these personnel receive training on how to
interact with suicidal students and what questions to
ask. No-harm contracts have been found to be a
promising intervention in the schools. School psychologists
are encouraged to have students sign such
a contract, which provides suicidal students with an
alternative to suicide and stresses the importance of
getting adult help and using local crisis hotlines. The
assessment of suicidal severity can be compressed to
three levels after direct inquiry.


1. <i>Low risk:</i> A student with suicidal thoughts but
no plan now to die by suicide, and with no
history of a suicide attempt.


2. <i>Medium risk</i>: A student with a history of a suicide
attempt but no plan now, or a student with

[p. <i>131</i>]

3. <i>High risk</i>: A student with a history of a suicide
attempt and a plan to die by suicide. A student
assessed at this level should be supervised constantly,
until he or she is turned over to parents
or authorities.


Regardless of a student's level of severity, the
student's parents must be notified, unless there is a
history of parental neglect, in which case protective
services would be called.


Parents have occasionally been uncooperative
and minimized the suicidal ideation or actions of their
child. In this situation, school personnel must be firm
in their insistence that counseling assistance is necessary.
Parents have become angry with school personnel
during this notification process and have tried to forbid
them from interacting with their child again. This
situation is covered in Texas by legislation stating that
under the circumstance of suicide, personnel such as
physicians, psychologists, and counselors need not
obtain parental permission to work with a minor. When
parents refuse to get emotional assistance for a suicidal
child, a referral should be made to the local child protective
services agency. It is absolutely essential that
the appropriate school personnel follow up and provide
emotional support, regardless of what the parents
do. Parents should be asked to sign an emergency notification
form that indicates they were informed of the
suicidal ideation and or actions of their child.


The most common factors in youth suicide are
depression, substance abuse, conduct problems, recklessness,
and gun availability. Young people almost
always tell their friends about their suicidal plans,
and, unfortunately, their friends do not always take
their threats seriously or solicit assistance from adults.
Because 60% of male and 47% of female youth suicides
involve guns (Poland and Lieberman, 2002),
many professionals believe that reducing gun access
to troubled youth is the single most critical factor to
reducing youth suicides. A number of schools have
started to screen depressed and suicidal students. The
Signs of Suicide (SOS) program, sponsored by NASP
and the National Association of Secondary School
Principals, has two primary components. The first is a
30-minute video that students view to increase their
awareness of suicide warning signs and to empower
students to prevent suicide through notification to
adults and local and national crisis hot lines when they
or their friends are suicidal. The second component
involves having students and or their parents fill out
a short questionnaire designed to assess depression
and suicide. Poland and Lieberman (2004) emphasized
that the SOS program has been used in some
form in more than 1,500 schools with students in the
8th through 12th grades, with very promising results.
It is particularly noteworthy that the SOS program has
been found to increase adult help-seeking behavior.
This promising program needs to be used by more
schools, but there still is much denial of the problem
of youth suicide; many schools do not want to take the
time away from academics to implement the program,
and there is also a modest cost involved.


Schools must have carefully developed postvention
plans in place for use after a suicide occurs.
These guidelines are very important to prevent suicide
contagion because adolescents are particularly susceptible.
Poland and Lieberman (2004) summarized
the literature about suicide contagion, which particularly
emphasizes that sensationalized media coverage
contributes to the contagion. They defined contagion
as more suicides than are to be expected in a specific
geographical location. The American Association of
Suicidology (AAS) published (1998) school postvention
guidelines that include the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Don't dismiss school or encourage funeral
attendance during school hours.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Don't hold a large-scale school assembly or
dedicate a memorial to the deceased.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>

and do contact the family of the deceased.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Do emphasize that no one is to blame for the
suicide.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Do emphasize that help is available, that suicide
is preventable, and that everyone has a role to
play in prevention.

NATIONAL TRAGEDIES


Many children in America viewed the extensive
and graphic television news coverage of shocking
school shootings, such as that at Columbine and the
9/11/2001 attack. School officials should anticipate
increases in feelings of fear for student safety in their
school subsequent to such an event. Such incidents
can present a "teachable moment" because students
are more open to discussion about the incidents and
are more open to constructive input from adults. The
following are key points:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Conduct faculty meetings to prepare for discussion
of the tragedy with students.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Make sure classroom discussions are focused on
how to make schools safer rather than on glamorizing
the perpetrators.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• The 9/11/01 attack especially demonstrated the
necessity of classroom discussions on diversity
so that all Arab-Americans and Muslims were
not blamed.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Young children should view very little, if any,
television coverage, and it should be emphasized
that the tragedy is far away, when that
is the case. Secondary students could view
the coverage but not constantly, and the most
important point is for the teacher to turn off the
coverage and lead classroom activities to
process the event.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Recognize that children of different ages are at
different developmental levels, with elementary
children in particular needing reassurance of
their personal safety. Middle and high school
students will have strong opinions about the
tragedy, a greater understanding of the finality
of death, and concrete suggestions about what
needs to be done.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Children look to adults to see how they are
responding. Adults should remain calm and
let students know that they have permission
for a range of emotions. Poland and Poland
(2004) stressed the importance of helping
parents and teachers cope first so they will be
better able to assist children. Younger children
especially need to express emotions though
play and artwork.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Children's questions should be addressed, and
they should be told the truth in age-appropriate

been comfortable venting strong emotions, and

School crisis literature can be divided into the
periods before and after the shooting at Columbine
High School on April 20, 1999. There is no doubt that
school crisis planning has improved post-Columbine,
with dramatic improvements in school and police
cooperation and a greater presence of police at school.
Additional developments have been the implementation
of zero tolerance policies for weapons and
violence in almost all schools, and many schools
have developed threat assessment teams that often
involve school psychologists. School psychologists
are increasingly asked to make an assessment of
whether or not a particular student is capable of
violence, but many school psychologists have not
been trained to make such an assessment. Poland and
McCormick (1999) outlined the following important
crisis lessons for school personnel:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Recognize that it could happen to you.

Crisis planning in schools has perhaps never been
so important as today in the aftermath of 9/11/2001.
All schools need a carefully developed crisis plan and
a commitment from both staff and students. School
administrators need to coordinate their crisis planning
efforts with local, state, and national homeland security
initiatives and must carefully review the excellent body
of literature available on the topic of school crisis.
School psychologists need to be represented in all areas
of crisis planning, including prevention activities.
