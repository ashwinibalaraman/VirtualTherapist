TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:
______________________________________________________________________________
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
PATIENT: I guess I'm just supposed to start off.
COUNSELOR: Does that make you uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Yeah, I guess, I don't know.
COUNSELOR: When you say the word "start?"
PATIENT: Yeah, kind of. Maybe it's just a good thing to each time how to figure out how I felt, you know, like after the last time. And it was really, you know, quite a big difference, like, I felt better than I have in six months, you know.
0:00:35.7
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And then I really began thinking about it, and I wondered if the - you know, it was a very supportive kind of thing but I kept wondering why - whether it was - you know, whether I was reacting to just something external that was said or whether I was really responding to something myself.
COUNSELOR: Something of your own?
PATIENT: Yeah, and, like, you know, I was thinking about what affected me the most, and it was really like kind of little, offhand remarks like, "I agree with you" or "I believe that too."
(Crosstalk)
PATIENT: You know, and I wonder whether that's really the right - whether (inaudible at 0:01:18.4).
COUNSELOR: Whether what?
PATIENT: Whether that's, you know, the most strengthening thing.
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like (inaudible at 0:01:27.7) emote strength something (ph) for you is to be able to have that, not from an external thing but from inside yourself.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: To feel strengthened from something you know, not from something someone else knows or thinks.
PATIENT: Yeah. Well actually, it did - it really worked that way, though, because I really - you know, I really do feel like much more that gradually - you know, the more I think, the more conclusions I come to that - you know, that there are certain things I really, really do believe. And that happened last night when I was talking to somebody about teaching and everything.
0:02:05.1
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And it just really came clear just while I was talking that, you know, what I really think is ultimately the most important thing is, you know, not the product but the effort, the sincerity, you know, the human expression behind it, you know. And I was saying that if a blind person made a rug with, you know, the colors not matching, the shape not perfect that, you know, I would respect that achievement much more than something that came out of a factory, which, you know, made it very - I just kind of made it very clear to myself that I really had to get out of this university bag.
COUNSELOR: Meaning so that you could have some kind of meaningful expression?
PATIENT: Yeah, I - that's the thing, I just hear, you know, the emphasis is of course on kind technical perfection, you know, writing monographs. And that's just not what I consider to be the most important thing at all. So, you know, it makes me much more sure about leaving and trying other things. And, you know, gradually, you know, just kind of every day those things are coming clear.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, you mean this kind of a feeling more and more like every day you can kind of - in the last couple of days you can kind of sense in yourself, my God, these really - there really are important things I believe and they really seem clear and more meaningful to me.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And they kind of - they're like a light in the darkness in a way.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah, I really feel just like I can handle things again, you know. And it was kind of a coincidence I think of, you know, starting to talk with you and also just other things kind of falling into place all at once. It's really strange that things like that happen, you know.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And - but I was just wondering, you know, about, you know, how much real strong effect these sessions would have if what I'm responded to is just a kind of personal conversation.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know, which to me is really the most important thing.
0:04:23.0
COUNSELOR: Now you just confused me by saying that.
PATIENT: Well, no, it is - I mean, you know, right at the moment it is the most important thing. You know, I wouldn't really want it to be any other way. I'd probably kind of give up on it if it weren't that, you know, kind of very empathetic feeling that I get. But I wonder ultimately, you know, am I really finding out about myself or am I just getting king of external, positive reinforcement thing.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I think I am. I really think I am because...
COUNSELOR: Think you're what?
PATIENT: No, I think I am, you know, realizing things. I really felt that after, you know, last - I really felt happy for the first time in a month. It was unbelievable (ph).
COUNSELOR: You mean after last time?
PATIENT: Yeah, Tuesday.
COUNSELOR: I guess, you know, I feel very torn about that too. (Inaudible at 0:05:11.9) I felt kind of bad about saying those things. I usually don't say those things.
PATIENT: But it really - I felt really much better.
COUNSELOR: I mean, because I kind of feel that, you know, maybe in a way, my saying those things can help you to feel and kind of crystallize that they are important and good things.
PATIENT: Yeah.
0:05:36.3
COUNSELOR: But I kind of feel torn about it because ultimately, that importance should come from you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And it will be all the more yours if it comes from you.
PATIENT: Yeah, I know, but it kind of it, though, just in talking with other people. You know, it's very strange how I've had really kind of crucial talks with about three or four people just in the last couple of days. And, you know, and I really could feel myself responding to it. You know, I really could - you know, I really, really did believe in what I was saying at that point. And I don't feel that kind of despair feeling anymore.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like the words had a clarity and they kind of rang true, you know, almost kind of like a clear day in a way.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know, it's like some of the morass of the despair and the cloudiness have disappeared I sense you're saying.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: And kind of the clearness of what lies ahead or what's important to you to do in your life was there, and it kind of gave you a sense of...
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Being whole (ph).
PATIENT: Well, yeah, it's not exactly euphoria.
COUNSELOR: No.
PATIENT: Because I really am aware of, you know, of leaving school and what that's going to mean. It really is kind of terrifying. But, you know, I feel like there are at least chances there, you know.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
0:07:01.7
PATIENT: You know, I feel kind of excited about it, which is certainly more than I feel here, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it gives you a sense of hope (inaudible at 0:07:12.5).
PATIENT: Yeah, so anyhow, that's kind of what happened in the last couple of days. I don't know.
COUNSELOR: And how you feel (inaudible at 0:07:28.0)?
PATIENT: You know, I felt really good, at first I was a little bit scared that this was just this little temporary thing, you know.
COUNSELOR: Was a kind of (inaudible at 0:07:37.9)?
PATIENT: Yeah, but it really hasn't, at least so far, you know, it's only been two days, so I've really, you know - I don't know again whether it's just a matter of coincidence with a lot of things happening outside of this, which is kind of made things gel again.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I really sense you're saying it feels good, and it feels like (inaudible at 0:08:00.2) that feeling sort of good inside, but that I don't know how to trust it.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
COUSELOR: It's like, is there a fear of it slipping away?
PATIENT: Yeah, I mean, there's just, you know, the knowledge of how I react to things and how I really can't control my emotions. And if I could somehow find some source of self-control, you know, that would be probably the ultimate thing that I could really gain from something like this.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You look like you're feeling nervous (ph) (inaudible at 0:08:40.3).
PATIENT: Not really.
COUNSELOR: And my saying that disturbs you?
PATIENT: Well, I guess a little. I guess if I feel nervous it's mainly because like, I'm not quite sure what to, you know, say.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and you feel funny about - okay now, what do I do type of feeling. (Inaudible at 0:09:19.8) I don't want to tell you that because I think that you're feeling the most (inaudible at 0:09:29.9) feels most present to you is this is really - and you're the one who knows that best.
0:09:40.7
PATIENT: Yeah, ultimately, I am the one who has to know it best, you know. You know, I guess I really - in a way, I think in a way the reason I react to, you know, certain kinds of things which really are personal strengths is that, you know, I really kind of detest complacency, you know. And, you know, maybe I'm just trying to avoid that.
COUNSELOR: I'm not sure I'm understanding what you're saying mean.
PATIENT: Like people who are very easy with what they believe, you know. I mean, there's never any doubts. You know, it would be perfect to find some kind of meaning where you're always kind of readjusting things, but yet, where you always have something to kind of hang on to ultimately too.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Yeah, but where - that's all second person (inaudible at 0:10:36.5), you, where are you? I mean, the (inaudible at 0:10:40.2).
PATIENT: Well, I'm very doubtful (inaudible at 0:10:44.3).
COUNSELOR: Say more because I'm seeing a...
PATIENT: Well, I think, you know, I question too much, you know, everything is too relative.
COUNSELOR: What you mean is that you think you take life too seriously in a sense and...
PATIENT: Yeah, I think it's...
COUNSELOR: And take on more meaning and you kind of wish you could be more relaxed about things.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that's - that was definitely one thing. Because, you know, generally, I'm really not a gloomy person like I'm showing (inaudible at 0:11:23.5) here. But I've been tending to kind of go in that direction right now, which is something I definitely don't want to do.
COUNSELOR: And, you know, so is the feeling there like you want to be able to not have things really throw you, I mean, that you could kind of feel a sense of inner strength enough that you can take it, well, that happened but...
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I mean, I still believe in myself.
PATIENT: Yeah, sure.
COUNSELOR: And what I believe in.
PATIENT: Yeah, because I have this really - like, I was saying, when I thought back about the last three years, you know, I know I really do have this capacity to change, which is good but it's also bad for me because it's this constant kind of flux thing, you know.
COUNSELOR: What do you mean?
PATIENT: Well...
0:12:13.2
COUNSELOR: What's the flux like?
PATIENT: Well, you know, it's, you know, never feeling that I've really kind of defined myself, you know. And that I really am too flexible with people, people can affect me much too greatly, I really take very seriously what they say and then readjust my own values. I'm doing that less lately definitely.
COUNSELOR: Is what you're saying, though, there that you feel like you're not enough inside and you're too moldable?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: By what happens and what people think about you?
PATIENT: Yeah, I know I am.
COUNSELOR: And kind of like when someone rejects you?
PATIENT: Then I reject myself.
COUNSELOR: It's - you know, you're really rejected - it's like all the things that are important to you, or you kind of say, maybe they shouldn't be important to me?
PATIENT: Yeah, so I assume...
(Crosstalk)
PATIENT: Pardon?
COUNSELOR: Like being vulnerable.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I kind of always assume that they must be right, you know.
COUNSELOR: Well, why do you assume that?
PATIENT: I don't know, you know, I guess just this inferiority thing, you know, that other people somehow see things more clearly and objectively, and they're more rational, realistic than I am. And, you know, I don't want to be ridiculously na�ve about myself, you know.
0:13:38.0
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. And you tend to believe what people think about you is the truth because - kind of feel like you sure as hell don't know what the truth is about yourself. I mean, it's like they're more important to you in a way than you are to yourself?
PATIENT: Yeah. I think it's a really great thing to be a people person, you know. But I think it can also be really self-destructive, you know, to be that totally involved with other people that you (inaudible at 0:14:18.0) there's nothing of you left, you know. Well, see, I think a lot of this really I did get from my parents because my mother especially, maybe I mentioned it, somehow believe that the best thing she could do for her children was to criticize them rather than support them, you know.
And to point out their faults so that they would always be aware of it, you know, and improve themselves. You know, and I just kind of grew up with this, just unconsciously, you know, in my mind. And so I always assumed criticism was - you know, was really kind of - you know, not - I didn't even look at the motivations that made other people critical - made other people rejecting.
COUNSELOR: It was your fault?
PATIENT: Yeah, always was my fault, always. And so then I - you know, somehow I felt the most kind of noble thing to do was to go and then rectify the situation, you know. And if that means changing myself, then I really run into difficulty.
0:15:20.0
COUNSELOR: Something I can't quite put my hand on, it's kind of complicated because it's like you really feel like you have to improve yourself, kind of what other people say about that (inaudible at 0:15:40.7) was kind of criteria. And it's like you just don't have your own criteria in a way.
PATIENT: Well, I am finally kind of developing.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's what I heard you saying last time was, like, you know, the things that were important to you. I also heard you saying, well, maybe they shouldn't be.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Maybe I'm wrong. (Inaudible at 0:16:01.8).
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, definitely about that kind of thing. I feel - one thing I do feel really sure about is that, you know, the way I would respond in a professional situation would be on a very personal level, you know. I'm really quite sure that I don't belong in school at least at this level. But, you know, when it comes to personal relationships, (inaudible at 0:16:30.9) I'm way too flexible.
COUNSELOR: How?
PATIENT: Well, I really look at how people - how I think people are responding to me.
COUNSELOR: Do you find, like, in personal relationships, do you find, like, that you're always looking to them for signs of what they're thinking about you?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, I'm sure I do that. I'm sure I kind of keep reading into things whether I've made it or not with them, you know, which is kind of totally - like, I guess maybe I mentioned that kind of bad experience with that guy who told me that he was - you know, his reactions to me were really kind of geared on pity.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that really kind of - well, I - you know, talked to him last night and it turned out that I've just been - I've mistaken the whole thing and misunderstood it. You know, that he meant pity in the best sense, you know, of - he meant really much more kind of compassionate, I think, you know. And, you know, I'll just pick out something like that and then just generalize. I really over generalize.
0:17:46.8
COUNSELOR: You mean it's, like, pick out something that can be critical of you?
PATIENT: Yeah, and then...
COUNSELOR: Or might not be but you see it that way, and really take it as a reflection...
PATIENT: Of a whole attitude, you know.
COUNSELOR: And a reflection of yourself too.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. You know, what I took from that remark, which, you know, had not been intended that way, was that I was just - I was a pitiable creature, you know, which meant therefore, that, you know, I really had kind of no dignity, you know.
COUNSELOR: Despicable?
PATIENT: Yeah, and this is really what I do constantly is generalize. It makes me kind of a manic depressive person because either it's the absolutely right or totally desperate. And I have to get more realistic about that.
COUNSELOR: Well, what's more realistic to you?
PATIENT: Well, you know, having enough awareness of not looking for panaceas. You know, like, I think, like, maybe I'm reacting to this getting out of school thing because, you know, all this is just going to solve all my problems, you know. (Inaudible at 0:18:58.9) fine, I'll really find myself because, you know, always in danger of doing that.
COUNSELOR: Putting all your eggs in...
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: The basket there may not be the thing...
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:19:10.2).
PATIENT: Yeah, I always kind of gear things on (inaudible at 0:19:14.2), you know, and I don't just kind of take things as they come.
0:19:20.8
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I don't really know, you know, what else to say.
COUNSELOR: Now having said that, what else is there?
PATIENT: You mean...
COUNSELOR: If it's making you feel uncomfortable (inaudible at 0:20:08.1).
PATIENT: Well, you know, I guess I feel like I've kind of come to some dead ends, you know, talking about things, you know, and, you know, kind of in general.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds like kind of - I don't know, I just get the sense, you know, you may not be asking for it directly, but I kind of get the sense, like, well, here it is, here's the outline of it and that's what I want to do, that's what I want to change is the way I am period and then a question mark.
PATIENT: Yeah, it's probably a very childish thing, you know, just to be looking for answers. I don't know, I think I'm just tired of problems right now. You know, I am looking for solutions, this is kind of a problem solving effort.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And does it make you feel uncomfortable that I don't give you the answers?
PATIENT: Well, you know, on a rational level I know that that's not how it should be or how it can be (inaudible at 0:21:48.3) an emotional level, you know, what if I just - it would be delightful if I just walked out with everything in front of me, you know, mapped out.
COUNSELOR: Here's the outline, that's the input, now here's the output.
PATIENT: I really can't quite pin down, you know, the reasons for having felt really good at the end of the last session. You know, like I said, it may have been just the little incidental things, which made it seem like, you know, this personal thing. But it did feel more substantial than that.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Well, I guess kind of - did it feel more substantial to you because it's just the - whatever caused it, it made you feel like you just knew more inside what you wanted.
PATIENT: Yeah, or...
COUNSELOR: Things that are important to you.
PATIENT: Yeah, not even that as much as that, you know, the rightist and kind of the goodest thing to be is just what I most am, you know.
0:23:02.1
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but - and, like, you could really sense that you could be that I take it. I mean, you have - yeah, that's it, it's kind of like you have more of a sense walking out you could kind of feel those facets of you more.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: The sense that you could be that way.
PATIENT: Yeah, and not in terms of thinking about the other - well, letting, you know, the outer world letting you be. But just that, you know, I have no other choice. I have to be, you know, what I most am, you know. And that's really kind of why I broke off, you know, the relationship with my family completely, you know, they don't have my address or anything. Because there had been a big scene over the summer, and it involved this guy that I'd gone with. Somebody called up my mother and given her this feeling that I'd been running around with a sex fiend and a drug addict, which was not that close to the truth but it was not that far either, you know.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And, you know, I knew that I had really, really loved this person not because he was those things, you know, which they thought would be some kind of, you know, terribly immature awe of somebody who was that free. And that they were really afraid for what this was going to be doing to me. But just because I knew him very well, I knew him completely. And, you know, so I began - I went through this, you know, a couple of days where I really didn't know, you know, what, you know, what the hell I'd done. You know, I thought, well, gee, it was wrong, you know, to have cared that way. You know, my feelings were wrong. You know, my family always has this power to do this. And then, you know, I...
COUNSELOR: They told you that your feelings were wrong or...
PATIENT: Yeah, I mean, they just kind of implied it.
0:24:46.9
COUNSELOR: You're talking about the scene now?
PATIENT: Yeah, it was just kind of implied in the whole thing, that how could I have had such judgment? How could this have happened, bla, bla, bla, you know? It was like a catastrophe, what a tragedy a - you know, family disgrace or something. And, you know, I realized that, you know, I realized that I really had felt best. I've been the most self expressive person, you know, the happiest when I was with that guy. And that my family had no right to impose those values on me at that point, you know.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And that if a family relationship meant that I was just constantly going to be kind of punished and made to feel guilty I did that made me feel happy, then it would just - there was just no point in even trying to explain anything. And that's kind of the way I felt, you know, when I walked out was that I, you know - and, you know, whatever makes me feel happy is what I have to do.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And then, you know, then I felt that made me feel much better. You know, there is no right or wrong.
COUNSELOR: You mean that what you made you feel much better is that - this was kind of being able to say to your family, look, I mean, this is me and this got brought in me, and it's not wrong that happened.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It happened.
PATIENT: Yeah. Well, that never really did come out, you know, when I think about it. I never really did say that, all I did was just react and rebel. And...
COUNSELOR: But that felt good?
0:26:26.7
PATIENT: Well, it was scary because I just knew that I wouldn't be seeing them for a long time, but it did - I felt good when I came back that I had all that freedom. But then what scared me was that I had the freedom but I had no control. You know, that I had total freedom to work things out, but it was hitting me that all of a sudden that things weren't working out at all, and that I just wasn't handling things and I wasn't directing...
COUNSELOR: You were just falling into this pit in a way?
PATIENT: Yeah
COUNSELOR: Kind of on your own but totally failing.
PATIENT: Yeah, and, you know, I definitely didn't see any alternative in going back to the - you know, to what my family projected for me, you know, is the right kind of life. That was not (inaudible at 0:27:13.5) at all. It was just like, you know, the reason I'm here is to become more aware of what I can kind of realistically plan for.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. I'm still - I'm back on what you were saying a couple of minutes ago when you were talking about this guy who brought out (inaudible at 0:27:39.9) the most self-expressive things in you, things that made you feel most alive and most yourself. And as you were saying that, I - are those things him or are those things you?
PATIENT: Well, that's a good question. I think that a lot of it was me. It was a lot of the things that I began feeling in Eastern Europe, you know, when I was away from any kinds of, you know, kind of prohibitions, you know, that my family had put on me. And that was really a very, very difficult time the first year because then I was just totally na�ve, and I was just confronted with all kinds of things. I was confronted with people smoking pot, you know. And my roommate who was very promiscuous sexually and everything, that was just the first time I ever really lived with it and that was really a hassle.
And then by the second year, you know, I could really accept it. And then after that, I kind of started looking at myself, you know. I started seeing a virtue in it. And so, you know, when I came back here it was really a very straight place compared to what I'd thought of it as being. And this guy was just like a breath of fresh air because - you know, I would never have responded to him if it hadn't been, you know, things in myself that I could see some kind of...
0:29:09.2
COUNSELOR: Well, what do mean, "this guy was like a breath of fresh air?"
PATIENT: Because he was very - you know, very free, kind of anti-intellectual in certain ways, you know. He's not - by no means unintelligent and he is going on with an academic thing quite seriously. But, you know, he's the opposite end of a pedant, he's just a very kind of spontaneous person, very physically active. You know, he kind of makes the most out of every moment. And that's what I really love. That was, you know, where I was in Eastern Europe. I just - I hated sitting still. I just love moving and doing things constantly.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And that was the kind of person he was. And, you know, that's why I responded to him. So it was, you know, things in myself that made me respond to him, you know. I never would have been interested in him, you know, if I hadn't been.
COUNSELOR: I guess what you're saying - is it something like that's - you know, like, in Africa I started to kind of realize all this potential and how I could be.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: And how I could live (inaudible at 0:30:17.7) feel very good. And when I got here, it's like they were just starting to be born, do you know what I mean?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: When I got here, it's, like, they all became thrust - that he was the source for bringing them out of you kind of...
PATIENT: Yeah, in a way he was, like, the only kind of agent that could have, you know.
0:30:45.7
COUNSELOR: And kind of, they all became - they were yours but they weren't yours to do with what you wanted. I mean, it was he who could bring them out.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And...
PATIENT: Because, you know, I can't autonomously be an expressive person. You're only an expressive person in relation to other people. And when other people simply don't respond to, you know - you just finally stop bothering.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, did he respond that much to you?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, sure, at first he did, yeah, definitely. But, you know, like when I was in college, you know, I was just totally, totally in love [ph], but I always kind of, you know, felt like there were so many parts of me that nobody cared to recognize. And so all I did was resent it, I never did anything about it. I never just went out and did something wild. I just felt like, you just don't know me, and I kind of hated people for not bothering to find out.
And, of course, there was no external sign that they (inaudible at 0:31:59.5) bother, you know, like, a very close friend that I developed in the Peace Corps, she's a very good friend of mine now. And she told me that when she first saw me she thought I was one of the blah-est looking people she'd ever seen.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And I knew that inside I wasn't a bla person. And, you know, it was, like, in the Peace Corps that I was kind of un-bla, things started coming out. And then coming back to this environment was like going back to the same kind of college thing where those things couldn't be recognized. And so I just kind of felt - well, I didn't really fall back into that, but I just - I felt kind of excluded in certain ways.
COUNSELOR: Fall back into that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: But didn't, you know, in part because you found someone who prevented you from falling back into that bla way of being.
PATIENT: Yeah, and the closest I came to falling back into it was after he left, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, that was the thing, I mean, I didn't finish saying, like, I was getting the feeling that you started realizing these things in yourself, and then kind of like he became a stimulus for them. It was, like, when you got rejected by him it was like the things weren't in you in a way (inaudible at 0:33:19.5).
PATIENT: Yeah, and...
COUNSELOR: And it's kind of (inaudible at 0:33:21.3), it's not only what - you know, there was nothing to bring them out but had been rejected in a way.
PATIENT: Yeah. But, like, my first reaction was to kind of desperately try to prove to myself that it really was me too, you know, which was to keep terribly busy and constantly run around. And then gradually, you know, and things of course kind of leveled off. And that just frantic energy just was kind of gone. Then that's when I just kind of got this desperate feeling that it really wasn't in me after all, you know. And I couldn't kind of maintain the strength that I felt that I had at a calm level.
0:34:01.1
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: It always - I was always, you know, madly trying to prove to myself that it really was there. It wasn't just the kind of quiet knowledge that it was, you know. And which I think I really am kind of closer to at this point now.
COUNSELOR: Kind of like (inaudible at 0:34:20.7) it's not happening overnight but maybe you could slowly feel a taking shape (inaudible at 0:34:30.6).
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:34:33.5) joyous, it's not bad.
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it's not. It's not joyous at all. It's a kind of solid...
(Crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's, like, it's happening slow but it feels there.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, definitely it feels substantial. And that's why I guess I mean that I felt better, you know, than I have in six months. And I guess in a way in that relationship I did get kind of complacent, and just kind of assumed things, just kind of react without ever really thinking.
COUNSELOR: What do you mean?
PATIENT: I know that sounds really hard, but, you know, with this person I guess I was just so totally kind of took things for granted.
COUNSELOR: What kinds of things did you take for granted?
PATIENT: That the way I was acting was something acceptable. You know, like, I never was really questioning my behavior at all because I was just totally into this relationship. And then, you know - so I wasn't really acting - I wasn't really being very deep about myself at that point, I was just being kind of totally non-introspective, which was very good for me. It was, like, the first time in my life that I hadn't just sat there and brooded, you know.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
0:35:49.1
PATIENT: But at the same time, I wasn't really establishing a very solid self-understanding of what was going on with me in that relationship either, you know. And, you know, I wasn't being very careful in that way. So that when the bottom fell out, I went right out with it.
COUNSELOR: And you had nothing to hold on to?
PATIENT: Uh-huh, because I had just kind of forgotten about myself. It was just kind of a feeling, you know, that I'm reacting to I guess. I really don't think I'll make that mistake again in another relationship.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kind of get the sense that you feel like you feel like you almost lost yourself with that - losing that relationship.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, it really did for a while, and that's when I went through this kind of panicky reaction.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: That's what I meant, I wasn't doing it - I was doing it to prove to other people, you know, that I was okay and to prove to myself that I was still going to make it, you know. And I just kind of emotionally exhausted myself in the effort, you know.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And then when things went down to a really kind of normal level, because this guy really does lead a kind of super active life, you know. And when I went back - you know, when I had to go back to being - well, I am kind of more refined than he is, and kind of not able to just drown myself in the moment like he does. And I consider that something really wrong, that because life wasn't going at this frenetic pace anymore that it was all over, you know. I wasn't kind of recognizing that I am basically, you know, a very active person, but a still a more gentle kind of person than he is.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
0:37:52.0
PATIENT: Because I saw all those kind of aggressive qualities as strengths.
COUNSELOR: In him?
PATIENT: Yeah, and therefore, strength because, you know, this was just like perfection. And, you know, that's just not my behavior.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds like it wasn't perfection, I mean, he didn't - it sounds like (inaudible at 0:38:15.6) or I don't know, it sounds like he just didn't care for you in a way that was really important.
PATIENT: Um-hmm, yeah, I was - yeah, I was pretty much supposed to model my behavior after his and it's never going to work. And because I came kind of close to being, you know, the kind of person he really totally responded to, I tried to be completely that person, which kind of left me in the lurch in the end. Because the kind of girl that he can really become involved with is kind of equally obnoxious, you know, I mean, she's as aggressive as he is. She - you know, just very, very independent with him. And I'm not that way, you know, so my rights in the relationship really weren't respected at all, and I really did get kind of used in a lot of ways.
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:39:15.9) too.
PATIENT: Yeah, and so, you know, I know it was really a bad thing and that's it. More and more I know it was a bad thing in general.
COUNSELOR: Kind of like in retrospect it seems like it was a bad thing, but it's sure as hell hard to see it as a bad thing while you were in...
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. You know, in many, many ways it was not a bad thing at all because the things that, you know, I experienced with him were really good, solid, happy feelings. And it's just a matter of not copying the situation to try to get out of, but to try to understand what really elicits that on a really substantial kind of basis.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: You know, and I think that gradually, it's getting closer to that. And I guess it was the same kind of resentment that there was no kind of stimulus to bring me out afterwards. And what I didn't recognize is that I can't depend on a stimulus, you know, that I have...
COUNSELOR: That's kind (inaudible at 0:40:24.4) when I said it sounds like you put - put it on him to be the stimulus for bringing you out. And...
0:40:37.1
PATIENT: Well, I didn't think at the time, you know, and I would be very independent. And for a long time I really was because I knew how I could just get totally drowned in a thing. But the minute the threat occurred, that's when I just became totally subservient, you know, because I - you know, it was worse to lose him than it was just to lose myself at that point.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Because he - because so much of yourself depended on him in a way?
PATIENT: Yeah, I hadn't really found other kind of sources of happiness.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, when you said that, like, in a relationship (inaudible at 0:41:10.3) was the point when you kind of started to realize that he didn't want you really, did...
PATIENT: That's when - yeah, that's when it became pliable. Before, when I hadn't felt that threatened, you know, then I could maintain and that was kind of cool thing, which is exactly what he wanted, you know, because he really does run from anything very tight.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:41:38.6) when you cool, sense this (inaudible at 0:41:45.2).
PATIENT: Well, gee, I don't know. I haven't thought about that. Maybe I do. Yeah, I guess in a way I really do resent, you know, the big emphasis on being cool because I know I'm not. And it's all just strain to have to be.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And it's a funny thing because I respect other people who are, but...
COUNSELOR: What do you mean by "cool?" Do you mean, like, a distant, hard (inaudible at 0:42:21.3)?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose in a way it's hard, I don't mean really like that. But kind of - well, serenely independent, you know, kind of non-involved.
COUNSELOR: And that's not your way?
PATIENT: No, it's definitely not. It would be easier, I guess for me if it were, but at the same time, you know - like, I really do resent the fact that women who don't - I don't think really, really deeply care that much about their husbands are the ones that men respond to because they're not obligated, it's not an imposition on them to be responsible either, you know, or not ultimately responsible.
0:43:15.8
COUNSELOR: I'm not sure I know what you're saying.
PATIENT: Well, you know, I think that men really like - they value aggressive, independent, self-assertive, self-sustaining, individual women now, you know, where a hundred years ago they really wanted a, you know, a housewife type.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And in a way I kind of - I resent that value because it would be so hard for me to...
COUNSELOR: To be...
PATIENT: To be that...
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:43:46.3), that's not the type of person you are.
PATIENT: No, but at the same time I know I really should be, for myself as well, you know, not...
COUNSELOR: Well, yeah, but it sounds - I guess we talked about this last time, it sounds like you should be would make it easier, but is that really what I want? I mean, I sense that's a kind of conflict for you.
PATIENT: Yeah, well, I think it is more than just making it easier, it's, you know, making me more kind of integral person, more truly self-expressive person.
COUNSELOR: Well, yeah, you can stand on your own two feet.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And not exist because you lean on someone else.
PATIENT: Yeah. It's kind of interesting, I was reading that article about Jane Goodall, you know, who did the experiments with the chimpan - or not - she (inaudible at 0:44:35.0) observations of chimpanzee' behavior in Africa. And she raised her baby there for two or three years I think. And she really modeled a lot of her own child rearing habits on the way the chimpanzees raised their young. And she found that the chimpanzees who - there was one mother chimpanzee who really kind of shoved her kid out of the nest thing, wound up with a really neurotic baby, you know, that would cling to her constantly, would never let go of her fur or anything.
And the one who was constantly hugging her baby, you know, the child was very free and independent and interested, and very curious and unafraid of its environment and everything. And I think, you know, what I really have to do is just get over that terribly protective...
0:45:23.1
COUNSELOR: The need to cling (inaudible at 0:45:23.8).
PATIENT: Yeah, you know, that this, you know, family who in a way kind of - you know, it was protective in a restrictive way, but not supportive, you know, either, you know, which makes the child unafraid (inaudible at 0:45:43.9). And I have to find, you know, internal, you know, support at this point.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, yeah, but primary to what you're saying about the relationship with this guy, it sounds like - at least, maybe I heard it wrong. You didn't cling until the threat of losing him became very real for you?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It's, like, when you were feeling secure in your relationship...
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:46:08.5) the relationship had a solidity didn't.
PATIENT: No, I'm not sure whether I really kind of consciously didn't or unconsciously didn't. I think a little bit of both, you know, I think in a way I was kind of consciously trying to prove myself, you know. And that I could really manage quite nicely without him, jus this kind of an ego trip thing. And then unconsciously I think I really was at that point afraid, you know, of a really intense thing. And then when it became an intense thing, you know, then I really had trouble readjusting. I kind of wonder if it would be more productive in these things if there were things that I should become more aware of kind of watching for, you know.
0:47:08.7
COUNSELOR: Well, yeah, you see, I mean, one thing that struck me is you have this very intellectual rational type of approach with respect to yourself. You know, I should (inaudible at 0:47:27.7) what I should watch for is really important, things that I can understand. I guess it's - you know, all that kind of watching and trying to understand things, you kind of can - it - I'm not sure exactly how to say this but it's kind of like you do that, I sense at the expense of really letting yourself experience what your feelings are about the things.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that's probably true, you know, like, I always kind of reacted against, you know, what people - people kind of assumed that since I was intellectualizing about things, I never really felt them. And that, you know, is definitely not the case. I really do intensely feel things and I know that. And it would be - it definitely would be a much - it would be really hell if I didn't learn to express them differently.
COUNSELOR: You see, but, you know, like the thing was - see, that's hard for me - I don't, you know - you said, like, you said earlier, you know, a person who just is emotionally uncontrollable or something, a phrase like that. And it's - you know, I don't get impression at all.
PATIENT: I know, people don't.
0:48:55.5
COUNSELOR: From what you're saying. And, you know, maybe that's the problem in a sense insofar as you can really have your emotions inside, but you can only do so much when your emotions are inside. And, you know, (inaudible at 0:49:17.2) problem in that it's, like, how to express those things with people.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Which, this is (inaudible at 0:49:25.8) way of - a long roundabout way, but see, like, the things you should watch for - at least for me the most important things to talk about really - you know, really just how you're feeling in the present. I could be right, you know, hearing that this minute. And to kind of be able to really experience what those feelings are. Not necessarily talk about them very rationally.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:49:57.2) really feeling lost.
PATIENT: Yeah, I - well, you know...
COUNSELOR: It feels like - if that's what you're feeling now.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, if there were, you know, some kind of - well, I hate to say (inaudible at 0:50:07.7) is more of a kind of technique, you know. But I really - like, I can describe how that kind of total despair was. It was, like, one night I walked in the dining room and turned the light on, and the whole thing was just hideous. It was, like, well, you know, here I go again, but, like, (inaudible at 0:50:30.5) thing nausea where nothing makes any sense, nothing, not the things you're looking at. The light makes no sense, nothing. And that was kind of the feeling of when I was really kind of cracking last summer of this walking on a treadmill.
You know, I mean, there are real kind of physiological feelings. It's a thing in my stomach, which is like a knot. You know, this thing - like, you know, I'll just putter around, there's nothing I can really do. I'll start something then I'll just quit, you know, or I'll wind up just going off and visiting a friend, you know.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And it's that kind of total kind of chaotic behavior, you know, that is the kind of most intense feeling that comes out in this despair thing, you know. And I can say why the despair, but it's really very difficult for me to kind of - you know, to kind of really pinpoint what it is.
COUNSELOR: What the feeling is.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You mean it's...
PATIENT: It might be very good if I really started trying.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean, as far as, you know, well, there are many kind of techniques or something, I mean, that - you know, this may sound very simple (ph), sometimes you just kind of have to sit there and rather than feel a compulsion to say something...
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And get some words out about something, kind of really just to listen inside to where you are.
PATIENT: Yeah, I have a problem doing that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, because I sense - I mean, you talk very, very quickly. Like, it's very important for you to always being saying something.
PATIENT: Yeah, I know. I just - yeah, I'm a very verbal person.
0:52:16.3
COUNSELOR: And, you know, I sometimes feel like when you're talking maybe you're leaving yourself behind in a way.
PATIENT: Yeah, well, it does sometimes really happen where I kind of crystallize something that way and then I really believe it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: You know, the minute I - I sometimes think that - you know, I don't say that I don't feel until I talk, but sometimes I don't think I really experienced until I talk. I don't know other ways to experience.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, well, it's not - you know, it's - I mean, the thing is, it's not like talking (inaudible at 0:52:48.8) that much.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It's not like talking or not talking, different kinds of talking.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: I guess is what I'm saying. And, you know, sometimes to really get the words to really describe and really evoke how you're feeling, it's not - sometimes you don't even know and just kind of have to relax and not - and let yourself, you know, kind of focus and feel what really feels most real for you, at any - at a moment in time.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah, well, this is (inaudible at 0:53:32.8) very academic thing, but if I can, you know, feel the distinctions or sense the distinctions between feeling and experiencing, and then intellectualizing, you know. If I can kind of express myself on all three of those levels at however many intervals there in between, you know.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: I think I just missed the middle point.
COUNSELOR: You missed what?
PATIENT: I think I missed that middle point of just - of experience - you know, like, I feel kind of brutal forces, you know, kind of really primitive things.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I just go right immediately intellectualize about them.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, is that kind of a feeling sometimes like, you have to do that to tuck them away or...
PATIENT: I guess yeah, to handle them.
COUNSELOR: To shut them off?
PATIENT: Yeah, to handle them, yeah, to get them into something, you know, in a kind of box that is contained, otherwise, I think it would all just explode.
COUNSELOR: It's kind of, like, when you can really feel things, it's really not to be trusted, and your feelings aren't to be trusted?
0:54:37.8
PATIENT: Yeah, that's probably true. Yeah, I do definitely go off the deep end when I feel despair, it means suicide immediately, you know, there's no other possibility of just living it out.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, so kind of, like, when you don't try to put things in a box and intellectualize things or whatever, because you better contain them because they could really be up-heaving.
PATIENT: A volcano underneath.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Which makes me look to other people as a very kind of cold, rational person, you know, that's what I mean that everybody thinks, you know, when I'm on the brink of <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> or something, of catatonia or something like that, you know, and, you know, totally self-sufficient and controlled.
COUNSELOR: You know, maybe - you know, maybe it's kind of important for you to kind of realize, you know, that feelings aren't so bad if you let them out.
PATIENT: Yeah, I know.
COUNSELOR: And express them.
PATIENT: I can know that rationally, but I can't feel that with my family, you know. If I watched a sad movie on TV, I had to go in the bathroom afterwards and cry and then go in my room, not let them see me because it was just, like, a mocking thing, you know, oh, you're feeling, this is ridiculous, you know.
COUNSELOR: Like, you're not allowed to have feelings.
PATIENT: Yeah, that was really true. And I was, you know, to use behavior (inaudible at 0:56:03.0) and positively reinforced for intellectualizing about it. My father got really excited when I talked about him in kind of academic terms, you know, that's just the way he operates. And I can see that now as a real problem on his part, but I can't really get out of...
COUNSELOR: Kind of like you see the effect it's had on you, that it's had that effect on you.
PATIENT: Yeah, and it's really hard to get out of it. And that would be a really good thing.
COUNSELOR: Well, we have to stop.
PATIENT: Yeah, okay.
