Mental illness affects people in different ways. It can creep up insidiously in the
form of deepening depression, undiagnosed and untreated, enveloping the
individual in a fog of despair and feelings of worthlessness.


Conversely it can appear seemingly out of the blue as happened in my case when
puerperal psychosis struck after the birth of a much wanted second child when I
was twenty-eight years old.


I was full of energy and joy for the first five days after the birth. With hindsight I
would say that I was euphoric, or hypomanic, but at the time this condition was not
recognised by the professionals involved in prenatal and postnatal care. I had been
extremely fit all through the pregnancy and worked three mornings a week as a
remedial reading teacher, as well as representing junior teachers throughout Wales
for my professional union, the National Union of Teachers (NUT). This involved
regular committee meetings in London and chairing a conference of young teachers
in Wales when six months pregnant. I appeared to be in a stable marriage, had a
gorgeous toddler of 21 months, excellent childcare and the option to continue to
teach part-time while developing a long-term interest in equal opportunities within
the NUT.


So what went wrong and why did it happen to me? I asked this question many
times over as this nameless illness took over my whole existence, wrecking
relationships and friendships, almost robbing me of my children and home, and
leaving me with a job at a time of full employment, but without a career.


On the sixth day after the birth I had to go to the supermarket to stock up the
cupboard supplies, which had run down in the time that I had been in hospital. I
set off for the nearest town aware that something was wrong and that I was feeling
distant from all that was happening around me. I put this down to the tiredness that
one feels after childbirth, as I had no close family support. Also, there was a
requirement to resume the normal role of a married woman in the mid-1960s; we
were expected to run a home and rear children without any lowering of standards,
while at the same time get the satisfaction from either full- or part-time work where
one knew one's skills and training would be used. Perhaps I wanted too much too
quickly.


In the supermarket things went from bad to worse and I was aware of taking
things from the shelves without knowing what they were or what I needed. I managed
to struggle back to the car, drove home and was put to bed. I ceased to eat or drink
and stopped talking to anyone. All seemed hopeless and pointless and I didn't want
to live.


I was admitted to the local psychiatric hospital under the Mental Health Act and
treated with a variety of drugs. No one gave me a diagnosis, no one gave me any

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I continued to have episode after episode of this mystery illness that had no
diagnosis, my confidence was shattered and at one point I was suicidal. To be told
to ‘pull yourself together’ or ‘think what you are doing to your family’ pushed me
further into depression. Some friends disappeared, my marriage ended and my
career as a teacher was jeopardised. Bizarre behaviour during the manic phases of
the illness was almost impossible to explain once I was stable again and apologies
were seldom accepted.


The turning point came with a change of psychiatrist after I had rejected the
system of meaningless three-monthly appointments with the repeated series of
questions asked by the original consultant. This had in no way given me the answers
that I needed or the diagnosis that should have been my right. The system also
appeared paternalistic. I was not allowed to ask questions, handle my own
medication in an informed way or move towards the smallest form of self-management.
I opted out of the system and became a ‘non-complier’. It seemed to
work for me for a time but, with hindsight, as a working single parent I was ‘up in
an airplane without a parachute’.


A summons from the new psychiatrist who took over my care and was irritated
by the cavalier way in which I ignored appointments brought me to heel. Via his
secretary he warned me that if I ignored the next appointment he would cross me
off his list. Then, when I needed his help, and as he said ‘I would surely need his
help again’, he would not be available.


Mutinous at this ultimatum, I nevertheless grudgingly kept the appointment
and from that first unpromising meeting my life was turned round. I was given the
correct diagnosis of manic depression, not schizophrenia, and put on the appropriate
medication, lithium. The diagnosis (not label) gave me back normality and ensured
that I tailored my lifestyle in such a way as to avoid stressful situations and people.
I took regular exercise and ate and drank sensibly. To my wail of ‘can't I even drink
red wine?’ came the reply, ‘just be sensible’. No paternalism there.

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My two children gave me tremendous support, handling my occasional attacks of
mania with great maturity all through their adolescence. My son dealt with
psychiatrists and hospital admissions without the help of a twenty-four-hour crisis
line or appointed keyworker. When he went to university, my daughter coped with
one attack while taking her A-level exams. Both my children had a healthy semi-detached
attitude to my manic depressive bouts, dealing with any problem as it arose
but getting on with their lives in the knowledge that I had a superb professional
working with me towards my managing the illness effectively, as I ultimately learnt to
do. They never looked on themselves as ‘carers’, they just cared enough to let me
manage the illness effectively on my own.


The psychiatrist who turned the illness around for me was consistently overworked
but still prepared to give an hour or more of his time to patients at crucial stages of
their illness when the need to talk was paramount and would not fit into a ten minute
slot every three months. An impending crisis would be dealt with, initially in my case,
by a short voluntary admission and later by self-medication and a few days off from
school. Time spent talking to me and identifying trigger factors paid off in the long-term
as I no longer needed expensive hospital treatment or regular out-patient
appointments. Diagnosis, self-management and a balanced partnership forged from
mutual respect returned me to a normal life.


After thirty years as a primary school teacher I am now a part-time lecturer in
mental illness to professionals, have worked as a lay assessor for the Social Services
Inspectorate at the Welsh Office and set up the Manic Depression Wales Office. You
could call me the ultimate late developer.


Most importantly I have a full and enjoyable life secure in the knowledge that I am
able to manage this major psychotic illness effectively on my own. As Bob Hoskins
said in the BT advertisement, ‘It's good to talk.’ In my case talking to the right
professional at the right time was a life saver.


Manic depression is a serious mental health problem involving extreme swings of mood
(highs and lows). Manic depression is also known as bipolar affective disorder. Both
men and women of any age from adolescence onwards and from any social or ethnic
background can develop manic depression. One in a hundred people will be affected by
manic depression at some time in their life.

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It often first occurs when work, study, family or emotional pressures are at their
greatest. In women it can also be triggered by childbirth or during the menopause.


The illness is episodic (occurs in phases). It is possible to remain well for long
periods of time. Typically the key to coping with manic depression is an early
diagnosis and acceptance of the condition. From this point, a person can take up
self-management, health care, therapy and medication as appropriate. Medication
is frequently prescribed, most commonly a mood stabiliser such as lithium. Talking
treatments such as cognitive—behavioural therapy (CBT) can also be useful, although
this may be difficult to access through the NHS. Severe or untreated episodes of
manic depression can be very damaging for individuals and their friends and
families.


Although much progress has been made in understanding manic depression and
how to manage it, research has not led to a consensus on either the cause or cure. Some
research suggests that there is, if not a known genetic link, then certainly an inherited
predisposition to developing manic depression. We also know that stressful life events
often precede an episode of mania or depression.


<i>Self-management</i>


Self-management is one way of coping with manic depression; it is not the answer, but
it can play a powerful role in the management of the illness. Research has shown that
self-management is an invaluable part of stabilising the condition. The self-management
training programme is built on the following principle: ‘People with manic depression
can become the experts on their own mental health.’ A key resource is the personal
experience and knowledge that each person brings to the course.


The Manic Depression Fellowship's self-management training programme was
written by people who themselves have a diagnosis of manic depression, and is
continuously improved and up-dated to reflect feedback and information from the
course participants about their particular experiences. The facilitators who deliver the
programme also have a diagnosis of manic depression, and have learned to use self-management
effectively.


The self-management training programme is user led and run. The programme
aims to help participants to develop new strategies, monitor their mood states, link
thoughts, feelings and behaviours, and to become alert to mood variations. Facilitators
act as role models for participants, demonstrating and sharing the personal experiences
and knowledge that have allowed them to gain confidence in taking control of their own
lives. Self-management involves learning to recognise early triggers and warning signs
of an episode and devising an action plan to prevent or minimise severe mood swings.
Perry and co-workers (1999) found that improved social function and performance in

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The Manic Depression Fellowship's self-management training programme is based
on the following assumptions:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• hope: people with manic depression are not ‘ill’ all of the time. They stay ‘well’
for long periods of time and are able to do what they want with their lives
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• personal responsibility: self-management is the process of taking control of
one's life through acknowledging personal responsibility. Users can become
active agents in managing their lives rather than passive recipients of treatment
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• self-advocacy: this is having belief in oneself, knowing one's rights, getting the
facts, planning a strategy, gathering support, targeting one's efforts, expressing
oneself clearly and being assertive. The self-management training programme
is built on the following principle: people with manic depression can become
the experts on their own mental health
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• education: the need for knowledge is broad, for example, from informing
oneself about medication, to looking at lifestyle, careers and leisure activities.

</table>

• education: the need for knowledge is broad, for example, from informing

The course is delivered over six weekly sessions of two-and-a-half hours each or a
residential weekend, incorporating a mixture of presentations, discussions and
participatory exercises.


The Manic Depression Fellowship chooses to use two images to illustrate the
connections between the components of a self-management training programme. The
image of a jigsaw is used to show that self-management consists of many techniques.
Each person may decide not only how many pieces there are but also which are the
appropriate ones to use.


The other image is a set of traffic lights. We are drawing on the analogy between the
three colours of traffic signals and the range of mood swings a person may experience.


The green light is associated with the times when life is going well and mood swings
are within an acceptable range. The amber light is associated with an increase in the
severity of mood swings, and an urgent need to take steps to limit this increase. Life is
becoming difficult. The red light is associated with danger, in our case an uncontrolled
mood swing and its consequences. Life has become impossible and we are no longer in
control. The aim of the course is to enable people to learn to keep the lights at green as
much as possible.


To date, over 160 men and women with manic depression have completed the
programme. Early findings reveal that although participants on the programme are
generally very positive about self-management, they lack confidence in the current mental
health system. Our research shows that it takes on average ten years to make an accurate
diagnosis of manic depression. Participants feel community psychiatric nurses and

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Suicide rates for manic depression are higher than for other psychiatric risk groups,
and it is extremely positive that participants on the self-management training programme
experience fewer suicidal thoughts or wishes after they have completed the programme.
This finding sends a clear message to the mental health system and policy-making
bodies that self-management adds an important dimension to conventional methods of
treatment.


Many members of the Manic Depression Fellowship with a diagnosis of manic
depression are finding that a good quality of life is usually possible with effective self-management.
Here are a selection of comments made by participants:
<blockquote>
<p>
‘I feel more in control of my psychiatrist, he found that my advanced directive was
the highest level of insight he had ever come across in a patient’
</p>
<p>
‘It's spring, I'm normally in hospital now’
</p>
<p>
‘Everyone had some constructive input to make and it was wonderful to be able to
draw upon the combined wealth of experience of the participants. There was a
common purpose — to keep well and get well’
</p>

Through a user-led approach the Manic Depression Fellowship is enabling
individuals to become empowered and take control over their own lives, which in turn
appears to be leading to greater social inclusion.

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Life as a child was happy and secure, but I may have acquired a psychological
vulnerability to depression during my first decade. My mother recently reminded me
of her own teenage depression, when she moved from under the umbrella of school
into the world of work.


Our family moved around the country as my father's career progressed. I was put up
a year at school at the age of seven, which I took completely in my stride at the time, soon
rising to the top of my new class. I attended four schools up to secondary level. It was
hard to make and keep friends, or to learn social confidence, but safe in the bosom of the
family I was happily unaware of this.


At the age of twelve I moved into a class of thirteen-going-on-fourteen year olds, all
of whom seemed to be interested in horses, clothes, pop music or boys, none of which
ever appealed to me as a teenager (going into a pub, let alone listening to pop music or
fancying boys, seemed to approximate to depravity in my parents' eyes).


I became socially withdrawn. I used to walk from class to class with my nose buried in
a book. I had periods that I characterised to myself as my grey days and I knew I wasn't
happy. At the age of fifteen I had a nice collection of mosses and liverworts, but no friends.


The sixth form at a new school was a happy time, but not long enough to allow me
to complete my developmental tasks. To my amazement I was offered a place to read
Natural Sciences at Cambridge. I had never been away from home for more than a few
days until then and homesickness set in rapidly.


I can't remember how my difficulties were picked up. An appointment with the
university counselling service was arranged for me, and I also acquired some
antidepressants via my new GP. The chaplain and his family offered support. At the
appointed hour I slunk fearfully to the counselling service building, scanning the
street to ensure there were no familiar faces (some chance). To my horror, the counsellor's
verdict was that I should see a psychiatrist within the week. I was overcome with shame
and inadequacy. I knew nothing of depression or mental illness.


I yielded to the overwhelming yearning to seek refuge at the chaplain's house for a
little while — an open invitation I had been careful never to take up. I needed people.
When the door was opened I dissolved into wordless, silent sobs.


I was moved immediately to the chaplain's home and soon gave up all pretence of
work. What's it like, seeing a psychiatrist for the first time? For many people this would
be akin to a major life event, something to be faced with trepidation, but by then I was
so far withdrawn inwardly that I don't retrospectively associate any fear or anxiety with
the event.

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the way back from the second appointment the psychiatrist phoned to say that I
should be admitted to some sort of psychiatric unit in the town. By the time I got back
to the chaplain's house, my bag had been packed and I was expected to go.


In fact I stayed only two nights, because the next day my tutor phoned my parents
who collected me, and so I returned to Sheffield.


The lack of follow-up was disastrous. I would like to think it would not happen
today. I should have transferred to the student health services in Sheffield, but my
elderly GP referred me as a private patient to an adult psychiatrist. Two months after my
return, I had a job as a laboratory technician at Bassett's Liquorice Allsorts, deep in
working class Sheffield. I took a long time to settle. The other women realised how
scared I was and generously provided a fair amount of mothering. I learned as much
about life from Bassett's as I did at Cambridge and am grateful for the acceptance and
friendship I found there.


The evening before I went back to college again, I sat on my mother's knee and wept.
She even said I didn't have to go if I didn't want to, but I said I must.


This time I stayed the course. I saw the psychiatrist every week for what would be
termed supportive psychotherapy for the three undergraduate years. I had a brief,
inadequate trial of antidepressants; stopping them after my mother caught sight of
the tablet bottle in my room. I signed up to do a PhD on river snails in Cambridge
and I changed to one of the three graduate colleges. I no longer saw the psychiatrist,
discovered men and gradually grew up. For the first time I started to question seriously
what I was going to do with my life and a chance meeting set me exploring the path
of medicine.


I lived in an eccentric but wonderful mixed house (in which I met my husband-to-be
just before finals) and was altogether purposeful and happy.


In 1985, within six months, there were three major life events, four if the onset of a
further depressive illness is included. Paradoxically this last came first, my fiancée
recognising changes during a skiing holiday in January. In February we started living
together for the first time in our own house in another city, and I became a senior house
officer in psychiatry. In June we got married. I didn't feel recovered from the depression
until October. Again, this episode was unreported and untreated, although not
unrecognised at work, but as usual it was too little, too late. No one knew my premorbid
self — another occupational hazard for the mobile junior doctor. I felt weak and
ashamed to be depressed again, particularly having knowingly gone into the job, and
just tried not to draw attention to myself.

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had met my psychiatrist socially on my return to Cambridge. She was delighted to
see me and hugged me on hearing that I was coming back to do medicine. We remain
in touch, and on occasion I have sounded out her opinion on relevant matters. As I
recall, our conclusion concerning my application for a junior psychiatry post was to try
it and see —fair enough.


Life events in 1987 clustered thick and fact. February: move to London, start registrar
jobs, twin pregnancy. May: final specialist exams for both. I pass, he failed. June: the first
routine ultrasound scan reveals the twins. Elation followed by a sense of immense fatigue
sweeps over me, grandparents to be (first time on both sides) rhapsodic. July: depressed,
I weep in front of the GP at an antenatal check, I am signed off for eight weeks before my
maternity leave starts — but no further intervention. August: and I am in the psychiatrist's
chair literally when I go to see our Professor, Anthony Clare, to ask for his support in my
application for part-time senior registrar training. Halfway through he suddenly leans
forward and says ‘You look strained... how <i>are</i> you?’ Like others before and since, he
commented that I was totally different from my usual self, and on hearing that this had
happened before, advised me to get myself referred to a psychiatrist (impressive: acute
and effective). November: the twins are born, at almost forty weeks.


1988 by comparison was tranquil. I started working five sessions a week as a senior
registrar from October 1988.


I discovered I was pregnant again in April 1989: three sons in two years. The twins
were still in nappies.


Three months later I got depressed. This time I was started on amitriptyline, which
worked. I didn't have time off, and started my maternity leave at thirty-eight weeks. I
remember cycling up to the Angel Islington without stopping in the forty-first week of
pregnancy. I was always in a hurry. Was I high? I took no notice of the first contractions
and had just bathed the twins a few hours later when my waters broke.


After the birth I went back to the psychiatrist, with relief She saw me weekly, but,
even so, it was hard to keep going. If I could somehow make it to the watershed of about
3.00 pm, the rest of the day was relatively tolerable. But then the clouds came down.


I knew the psychiatrist would be away for several weeks in the summer holidays. At
the penultimate appointment, the word admission was mentioned, in the context of
brief respite, a last resort.


Two days later in August 1990, I was admitted to the acute psychiatric unit at a
London teaching hospital under the care of a different psychiatrist. I was discharged
almost six months later.

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Depression is a common and severe disorder, with serious consequences
for the individual, those around him or her and wider society. Women are
twice as likely to suffer from depression as men. Depressive symptoms
may be more common in disadvantaged people, but depression can affect
people from all sections of society, including the health professions. This
account of lifelong episodic depression describes the damaging effects of
depression on the education, career and relationships of a young woman,
training to be a doctor. It also provides a remarkable account of resilience
to adversity, of how the effects of depression can be reduced and sometimes
overcome.


Depression causes major personal turmoil and reduces quality of
life. It can contribute to the breakdown of marriages and families, and
in depressed mothers may sometimes delay the development of their
children. It is difficult to comment on the health of someone without
having met her, but in this account the author appears to describe the
‘classical’ symptoms of depression.


Depression has many causes, ranging from genetic predisposition to
the effects of childhood trauma. Among other causative factors, the author
describes the history of depression in her mother, the adverse effects of
moving house on her childhood friendships and the untoward effects of
high academic expectation. Most people believe that pregnancy and
childbirth should be times of contented fulfillment, but she gives an
unblinkered account of depressive episodes arising during pregnancy
and after delivery — times in which depressive symptoms are actually
rather common. She also describes the difficulties of mothering three
young children, while simultaneously attempting to progress through
her medical career. These causes can be counterbalanced by factors that
act to increase personal resilience, and she also gives a clear account of the
beneficial and protective effects of shared student accommodation,
supportive intimate relationships and paid employment.


Once established, depression usually recurs and sometimes seems to
develop a life of its own, independent of good or bad circumstances,
beneficial or disruptive life changes. In this account, prolonged periods

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Stigma and discrimination make people who might be suffering from
depression reluctant to seek treatment, and the recognition and treatment
of depression by doctors and other health professionals can be poor. The
author reports the difficulty in disclosing her health problems to even
presumably sympathetic work colleagues.


This account describes the effects of recurring depression in a
professional, married mother. How would a man have coped, if affected
by this recurring and unpredictable condition? Although there is
considerable overlap in the types of depressive symptoms experienced by
men or women, male depression is rather more associated with
restlessness, irritability and aggression, alcohol consumption and
‘workaholism’. These behavioural manifestations of depression in men
can lead to friction with partners and work colleagues, resulting in marital
breakdown and unemployment. Men are at greater risk of suicide, but are
less likely than women to present for help, or have their underlying
depression recognised, and are also less likely to persist with treatment.


Depression is nasty and brutish, but not short. Most patients will
experience recurring episodes of illness, but with treatment these can be
shortened and many can be prevented. Public attitudes to depression
have altered over the past decade, but more work is required to reduce
misunderstanding and prejudice.

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In my childhood, I experienced a great deal of anxiety and depression but I did
not have a name for these experiences. I was born the middle child of nine children to
an alcoholic father and a mother who gambled and suffered from depression herself.


Because of suffering physical, mental, emotional and spiritual abuse, I began to
run away from home at the early age of nine. I was detained in remand homes,
approved schools, and borstal training institutes, going on to a young offenders institute
by the age of seventeen. I had begun to shoplift from the age of about six, to provide
basic needs for myself and my family. This was encouraged and so became a way of
life for me. I began to self-harm when I was twelve or thirteen. The only
acknowledgment of my problems was when I was treated with chlorpromazine at the
age of thirteen and I was told this was because I was high spirited.


I experienced suicidal feelings when I was about fifteen and the GP referred me
to a psychiatric unit in my home-town of Glasgow. After a short time there I was
transferred to a larger hospital and detained in a locked ward, owing to self-harming
behaviour. Within a week, I was discharged. My next admission to a psychiatric
unit was after the death of my younger brother, when I made a suicide attempt at
the borstal institution. I remained in that unit for six weeks and received no
medication or therapy.


When I was nineteen and training to be a nurse, I once again felt suicidal and took
my first overdose. This occurred on numerous further occasions and I was diagnosed
as being a psychopath but offered no help in dealing with my problems. All I
understood from this diagnosis was that I was some kind of murderer and feared the
day I would indeed murder someone. It meant to me that I was someone without
feelings and I felt very mixed up about it because I knew that I did have feelings.


It was inevitable that I was attracted into a very dysfunctional relationship with a
man and had a child with him. He was an alcoholic and, about that time, I began to
drink heavily too. I suffered much abuse within this relationship and finally left after
three years in fear that my child would also suffer if I stayed. I continued to drink
heavily every night.


At twenty-four, I married into another dysfunctional relationship and had four more
children, as well as two miscarriages and a second abortion. I had stopped self-harming
and was able to raise my children for a number of years, though still drinking every night.

As my drinking worsened, I began to experience the trauma of delirium tremens,
whenever I tried to stop drinking. Shaking, violent sweating, vomiting and terrible
fears were common symptoms to me. Hangovers made daily functioning difficult,
sometimes impossible.


I was not aware that I was an alcoholic, even though all of my family, except for my
mother, were. In 1986, when my father died, I began to question myself about my
drinking. I saw my GP who referred me to a consultant psychiatrist specialising in
alcoholism. He asked about my drinking and told me that I was severely depressed.


Although about that time I joined a fellowship, which used the twelve-step
programme, in the hope of dealing with my drinking problem, I ignored the consultant's
advice about my being severely depressed because I did not believe this to be true.


Unable to stop drinking for more than a few months at a time, I finally began to
feel the full force of my illness in 1991. I could no longer cope with life as I had been
doing. I felt that I was unable to go on for another day. It was at this point that I took
myself back to the consultant and asked for help. I was sectioned under the Mental
Health Act because I felt suicidal. It was explained to me that I was severely depressed
but I still found that hard to believe. After spending five months in the hospital, I
began to realise that the way I was feeling was known as depression. I could see no
reason to live, I had lost any sense of feeling that I had had before. More importantly
to me, I no longer cared about my life or my children. Everything seemed pointless
and I had no motivation left for anything. Food became increasingly difficult to eat.
Sometimes I would only eat at the insistence of others.


From that day to this I have had a great struggle to stop drinking. It is now just
over one year since I wanted to drink alcohol, the longest I've ever been without it. My
marriage ended and I now live alone with my children. Self-harming and suicidal
thoughts and attempts have been a pattern of behaviour for me since I was first admitted
to hospital in 1991.


I experience depression of varying degrees, which does not respond very well to
antidepressants. I suffer nightmares, and often find it difficult to get through the day. I
have little appetite and my sleep is poor. I take sleeping medication.


Last year I spent some time working with a clinical psychologist. I am now in the
process ofbeing assessed to receive treatment in the form of intensive group psychotherapy.

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The author's description of her struggles against depression and
addiction makes disturbing reading and she gives a moving account
of both childhood deprivation and the difficulties that often accompany
it. Unfortunately the pattern she describes is not uncommon, especially
where, as in her case, her father was alcoholic and her mother
depressed. Children of alcoholics have more than their share of
insecurity, and if the other parent is depressed this doubles the
problem. Rutter and Smith (1995) have emphasised the influences of
family and environment in causing difficulties for children in their
development.


Added to this is the effect of institutions. In trying to escape from an
abusive home, she found herself detained in the often impersonal
environment of the juvenile offenders' system. Her low self-esteem, self-harm
and suicidal feelings are all too understandable in the light of these
earlier experiences.


People who have experienced this kind of childhood may develop
many different patterns of disturbance. In this case it has been mainly
depression, self-harm and alcoholism, but in other cases bulimia, drug
misuse or psychosis may occur, and the suicide rate is higher than in the
rest of the population. Relationships are particularly difficult, and in some
people relationships are impossible because of the complete inability to
trust an intimate partner. She describes her first relationship as abusive
and her second as dysfunctional. The second lasted considerably longer,
and may have been viable only for as long as she was drinking (in itself a
dysfunctional factor). It may be significant that this marriage ended when
she gave up alcohol.


Taking control of her life was a very important step forward, and the
joining of the twelve-step programme seems to have begun to break the
cycle of drinking and lack of control, and given her time to think.


In the past year, with abstinence from alcohol and help from the clinical
psychologist, she appears to have made real progress. The proposed group
psychotherapy is again a hopeful factor, and will help her if she can get it.
Although she says the antidepressants do not help very much, they seem

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She is a survivor in the best sense of the word, and she has done well to
have a marriage that lasted some years, and to be able to raise her family of
five children. She is clearly more vulnerable than most people, and future
stress could lead to depression or a relapse into alcoholism. However, she
has considerable strengths, and has survived many past stresses without
collapsing, and with support and help she may well remain stable and
free of addiction.


On my unit at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, dealing specifically with
people who self-harm, we see many patients, both male and female, who
have had negative childhood experiences and whose current pattern of
behaviour includes self-harm, suicidal attempts, bulimia, drug and
alcohol misuse, low self-esteem, self-hatred, depression and relationship
problems (Crowe &amp; Bunclark, 2000). This is a group of patients who up
to now have had less help than other general psychiatric patients, although
their problems of adjustment may be just as great. Motivational difficulties
and ambivalence towards treatment make them ‘difficult to help’, and
their need for a dependent relationship can make it sometimes
problematic to treat them in psychotherapy.


There are, however, some hopeful signs, and mese include the development
of some effective treatment approaches, such as dialectical behavioural therapy
(Linehan, 1993), cognitive therapy (Salkovskis <i>et al</i>, 1990) and the use of
‘emergency cards’ for accident and emergency attendance. Community health
teams are developing strategies to help abuse survivors and self-harmers, and
family therapy can help both the patients and their partners and children to
understand the problems and cope with them.


In those who have suffered sexual abuse, it is probably best not to go
into too much detail in therapy, but preferable to ‘reclaim the self’ and to
work on self-esteem in the here and now (Crowe &amp; Dare, 1998).


So, although nothing can be done to change the past, survivors of all
kinds of childhood abuse can often overcome the after-effects and live
more healthy and satisfying lives with the help of therapy.

It was seventeenth June 1999. I was in Dublin and I'd just missed the band
I'd been sent to review for a magazine. I was drunk and stoned, as I had been
for some weeks. Friends were worried. Apparently I'd been talking to my
computer and it had been talking back. But as far as I was concerned life was
cool. I'd split up with an alcoholic double my age and he'd stopped berating
me on the mobile phone thirty times a day. My work as a journalist and as a
DJ was in recovery and I was in Dublin.


Although I did not know it, I was acting strangely. Drawing postcards at
the bar, proudly emptying my Gucci handbag of its contents, lining up the
cosmetics for all to view. More people than usual asked me if I had any
drugs to sell. In the morning I took a cab to the airport. I lost an unrequired
passport and my ticket. They wouldn't let me on the plane. I thought I had
to save the world, I ran between the bureau de change and the departure
board tallying up random numbers from departures and writing them down
on bureau de change slips.


When this didn't work I began to pick up bits of rubbish from the floor;
I thought they were clues left for me by the London art underworld. I
thought I was a living sculpture/installation and started a performance next
to the security desk. The police arrived and took me for questioning. Before
long I was in an ambulance. At the hospital I thought I was doing a royal
visit and mistook the admission form for a death certificate. Excellent, I
thought, only I could get away with a fake death.


Having gone to look for a smoking room I fell on an exit and left. I walked
for a few hours and found my way back to Dublin. There I made enquiries
about my passport. Nothing. Later I met a guy in a funny suit, Brian. We went
for a milkshake. He turned out to be rotten, weird and full of lies. Over the
next week, like a magpie he had taken my jewellery and my clothes.


He persuaded me to stay in Ireland for the summer solstice. I thought it
might make a good story. He'd told me of some parties happening and to be
honest it sounded like a good break. My life had been hectic for a long time.
He'd told me he was a singer, and I said I'd manage him.


So together, armed with staffs made from sticks and lumps of amethyst,
we roamed the countryside, often getting in trouble. One night I found
myself in a Jacuzzi, the next I'd be in a farmer's bed. We'd get thrown out

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I don't remember arriving at St Brendan's psychiatric ward. It was a sad
place for about fourteen women. I tried to escape once but failed. I made
one friend. My dad flew over immediately; my mum followed a week later.
My main concern was getting back to my home in London's Clerkenwell. I
was helping to organise a street festival. It took another week and a half to get
out of St Brendan's. People rang me, including the ex. He'd just written a
book and dedicated it to me, which added to the stress.


I was transferred to Ealing Hospital's John Connolly Ward. I was there
for five weeks. I saw people slit their wrists and fights, but generally it was
OK. After that I moved back to my parents' house, where I still am.


I'm better now. I came off the haloperidol at Christmas. I'm in drugs
counselling and I don't go out every night. I've been temping a bit but I
hope to get back into writing. The depression after hospital was horrendous;
the side-effects of the drugs were also intolerable. I'm thinking about
training as a mental health worker.

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Born in 1952, third of five boys. Father, Bernard, studied chemistry before wartime RAF
then civil aviation as pilot. Mother, Fioni Llewellyn, dancing and elocution teacher before
wartime WRAF then housewife.


Family moved from West Drayton to Scotland when I was five, following Dad's job.
Here I went to local schools, doing very well until senior secondary. I began failing exams
and losing interest. I hated Greenock High from day one.


By age sixteen I occasionally had a drink, filched from parents' sitting room. Regularly
smoking too. First pubs around seventeen — very convivial.


Mum was warm and comforting, but no pushover. Dad was strict and I was mainly afraid
of him. He was kind, too. His punishments were severe, but rarely physical. His work took him
away from home for several days at a time, and I usually dreaded him coming home.


I left home at eighteen with six O-Levels and a Higher in English, Dad having found
me a temporary job and digs in London.


In my twenties, my social life revolved around pubs or parties. The latter always made
me nervous and I would usually drink excessively.


I never settled. I shared flats with friends — successfully at first. I worked as a van driver,
labourer, arborist (I enjoyed that particularly) and in 1979 began fourteen years as a
motorcycle messenger.


Age twenty-one I tried marijuana. By twenty-five I was smoking it daily and protecting
my supply. This habit continued until 1996. I tried other drugs, that is LSD, cocaine and
speed. Of these I liked LSD and used it periodically, but not frequently until around 1993.


Looking back, I was in some kind of trouble by 1980. Around then I stopped going to
parties. I was getting what I now think were panic attacks — no breathlessness but a very
sudden, deep feeling of fear, inadequacy, uselessness right in the middle of a party or pub
gathering, usually when there were many people around. Around this time I started
drinking at home, with or without company. I was working only enough hours to pay the
rent and drink and drug bills — two to three days a week.


In 1980 I was supposed to be saving for the ‘trip of a lifetime’, a year's working holiday
in Australia, but I was too lethargic to earn enough even for the ticket. Eventually, my
brother Patrick, who lived in Tasmania, bought it and I went out in 1981 with my leaving
pay packet and ninety pounds for the bike.


I worked hard as a driller's mate but I found myself alone at weekends and drank
heavily.

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After six months I was able to leave Tasmania with enough money to buy a car. I went to
Southport, New South Wales, to meet a co-worker from the drilling job.


Eventually, I started work as a wood-chipping plant operator in Brisbane. I learned that
being in a different country did not change my attitudes. I was still unmotivated, and if
there were any problems with machinery I would make little effort to get it going but
simply close down the shift and go home.


I returned from Australia in late 1982 and got back to work as a courier. I lived with a
friend near Bermondsey. In March 1983 I got into trouble with a pub landlord who, after
much provocation, bashed me with a cut-down cue, causing the loss of my left eye. Drink
was involved, in that I wouldn't have been so loud-mouthed without it.


It didn't occur to me, even after the ‘eye’ incident, dial I had a drink problem. Depression,
sure. Anxiety, perhaps.


A year after losing my eye I was back to work on bikes but nothing much had changed.
I shared flats with people but I was morose unless drinking and not good company. I was
asked to move on a few times. I fell back into working only sufficient time to maintain my
minimum lifestyle of cigarettes, drink and marijuana. I began to ‘get into’ computer games
- my fourth drug, as I came to think of it later. Where I had no (nor any longer sought)
relationships, the interactive screen became substitute.


Following a letter to my parents, I was introduced to the Tavistock Clinic for Human
Relations.


Around 1987 I went to the weekly group for two years and found it a waste of time. I was
living near Beckenham at the time. I got beaten up at a party about a mile from home,
which is where I found myself the next morning, bruised, bloody and with no recollection
of what had happened. I discovered later that I'd upset an ex-para. I decided to take three
months away from alcohol, just to make sure that I could. I did.


I moved a couple more times, winding up in a bedsit in Streatham, a slightly dingy,
damp place, but it was mine; I paid the rent and felt secure for the first time in years. At first,
I used the (very) local pub, but they took away the pin-table and pool table. This also took
away my people-buffers so I stopped going. I was in a cycle of drink, dope, work and
computer games, which never really ended until I got to rehab in January 1996.


As my fortieth birthday approached (9th January, 1992), I decided that my present to
myself and my family would be to take a year away from alcohol. Although I didn't think
that it was my primary problem, it sure was something I needed to look at. I cut out dope
at the same time, but that only lasted three weeks. I wasn't particularly aware of any changes.
I still wasn't going out unless I had to, although I would very occasionally meet an old
friend in a pub; I'd drink tonic or coke.

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I bought a car, an old banger, early in this ‘dry’ period. The idea was that, because one
of my excuses for not visiting folk was dodgy weather and my growing fear of death by
motorcycle, the car would give me freedom. I took it on a trip to Scotland, visiting relatives,
but only used it twice more in London. I just didn't like going out.


In October, I promised myself that I could have a drink following New Year's Eve,
which I duly did, very moderately. I then waited the remaining nine days before letting
myself see if I could drink ‘like a gentleman’. Within a month I was back in the same old
pattern. I went to see my GP about what turned out to be thrush. I asked for a psychiatric
assessment. He suspected diabetes and sent me to hospital for tests.


I persisted with requests for a psychiatric assessment and was eventually referred. I paid
myself to take ten weeks off work to attend the Drink Crisis Centre four days a week, where
I learned a great deal about the mechanics of alcohol abuse, but didn't apply the lifestyle
information provided. I also went to one-to-one counselling, which I didn't find of any use.


In April 1994 I left work. I was so distracted with my ‘problems’ all the time that I was
convinced I'd have an accident. Probably would have. I left work with a clean license.
The psychiatrist referred me to the Addiction Clinic to stop smoking, which I did for
eighteen months, only taking it up again when I was admitted to hospital for a six-week
detox. While there, I had my first meaningful contact with AA.


I went to have ten months of rehabilitation. I liked the groups and didn't mind the
numbers of people and general mayhem too much. I had to go to at least three AA
meetings a week and frequently went to more. I went to an open learning centre and
taught myself to use Microsoft programs such as Word, Access and Excel. I became a
volunteer assistant trainer and stayed with the open learning centre for some time.


The rehabilitation staff were true to their word and found me my current flat, in
Battersea. I took the plunge into the world of work again. This period was a time of hope.
I never missed the alcohol or dope. I learned much about myself and people in general. In
January 1998 I took the job of IT tutor with the group who ran the open learning centre,
knowing that I would be virtually no better off financially, but believing that it would lead
to better things.


I became disaffected at work -I didn't see eye-to-eye with my immediate boss and
hated the commercial aspects of the job. I became depressed again. By May I was smoking
dope and by June was drinking. I hung onto the job until September, when our section
was closed down. I went back into hospital, stopped drinking and attended a day group
three times a week. In January I drank again and had to leave. I've been muddling along
since then.

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

These very personal and honest accounts by two people whose lives
have been radically changed by their use of different substances are
fascinating reading. They are a timely reminder to me and I hope to
anyone who reads them of aspects of substance use disorders that are
easy to forget.


In the treatment services where I work there is often a conspiracy
between many of the service users, the doctors, nurses and others who
try to help them and (possibly crucially) those who plan and pay for the
services. This conspiracy is that substance misuse problems are easy to
treat and that the individuals' problems are somehow trivial. The
substance users themselves believe this because they genuinely want to
be better and want to have a problem that can be solved after a few
months of treatment. After all who wouldn't? The individuals who
provide treatment want their treatments to work quickly and well. They
may confuse harm reduction interventions such as the provision of
clean needles and quick detoxification treatments with a permanent
cure. The harm reduction interventions are valuable and needed but
they must not be confused with the complex and long-term process of
achieving permanent abstinence. The system that plans and pays for
services wants to provide interventions that are cost-effective and wants
brief treatments to work well.


Long-term or intensive interventions are expensive and difficult to
deliver. The account of the way alcohol has dominated Keith's life
should persuade us all to accept what a long-term and severe problem
an addiction can be. Probably the only treatment philosophy that
completely accepts this is the alcoholics and narcotics anonymous one.
As an approach it has many critics and faults but its acknowledgement
of the long-term nature of addiction needs hearing.


These accounts of lives changed by substance misuse are profoundly
personal. They demonstrate how addiction problems penetrate to the
deepest regions of an individual's inner experience and to their contacts
with the outside world, their work, their relationships and their identity.
Randy's account of her drug-induced psychotic illness and the changes
it induced in her personality and behaviour illustrates this graphically.

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The link between these accounts is the use of substances. In other
ways they offer very different experiences of the problems. Substance
misuse may present people with a variety of problems from acute periods
of psychiatric illness as illustrated by Randy's account or the long daily
grind of alcohol dependence as illustrated by Keith's.


Neither account says much about the treatment system.
Detoxification or an in-patient admission is a small part of the experience
of the illness. Doctors, nurses and drug workers can, arrogantly, believe
that their intervention in the life of an addicted individual is the most
important one. We all forget people's daily struggle with their illness,
which goes on when they are not in the clinic or on the ward. Even
detoxification, which appears a defining event in the course of an illness
while it is happening, may seem trivial in the life of an individual living
with an addiction problem.


Treatment is only a small part of the experience of an individual
struggling to become and remain abstinent from drugs. Almost all of
the work is done by those individuals themselves. They resist or succumb
to cravings, deal with daily withdrawal symptoms and learn to
understand the triggers that make them relapse. Many deal with
disabling psychiatric symptoms that accompany their misuse of
substances. At its best, treatment must enhance substance users' own
strengths and enable them to use their own abilities to support their
recovery. It is about providing people with psychological and
pharmacological tools that they can put to good effect. Plainly, we are
unable to solve their problems for them.


Perhaps the most important lesson to gain from these accounts is to
listen to our patients. They grow to know and understand their
addictions better than us and can usually tell us how to plan their care.
We can learn how to develop services more sensitively so that they will
be appropriate to users at different stages in the course of their illness.
Our patients will also remind us to be humble and to acknowledge the
huge power and pervasiveness of addiction.

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My contribution to this book is a big secret -because I work in a psychological field directly with patients and,
unknown to my employers or my friends, I have an obsessive—compulsive disorder (OCD). Only my partner
knows about my condition.


In OCD the sufferer experiences anxiety - often very severe - caused by irrational intrusive thoughts
(‘Obsessions’) that he or she is driven to allay through the performance of rituals (‘compulsions’).


<i>OCD and me</i>


I had a strict Catholic home-life, and was a boarder at convent school from the age of seven. In those days (and I
am ‘mature’ now) convents really were severe. My OCD has a strong moral/religious tinge, with powerful feelings
of guilt and shame, which, though I am no longer a Catholic, I'm sure have come from that influence.


From about aged eight, I developed worries with rituals. All of these, or their remnants, have remained or
spasmodically returned over the years, and I've never been really free of them. Mainly, these were: first, at eight, a
terrible fear of leaving the attic light on at home and harming my parents by wasting their money; so I kept
climbing up to re-check; from about nine, a terror of committing a mortal sin -for which, we were taught, I
would go to hell for eternity unless I got it forgiven before I died (which could be at any moment); also around
nine, a ‘Lady Macbeth’ need to wash my hands and body excessively, one of my most persistent problems; and at
about fourteen fears around sex. I knew virtually nothing about sex, and had understood from our teacher that the
slightest momentary sexual thought was a mortal sin. That single statement terrified me, and was the only
Catholic teaching on sex that I received at school. I also had a horror of toilets -with long phases of avoiding
public toilets altogether, reducing my work and social opportunities; a fear of hurting others through poisons or
chemicals, or bits of food that had gone bad; a dread of harming anyone by what I might say or write. In my
profession, this has entailed my spending extra time (unpaid) in re-checking my own written work.


As a child I tried to ask some grown-ups for help about these things, but they did not understand and I felt so
ashamed that I stopped telling anyone ever again.


<i>What interventions have helped and what have not?</i>


As a young student, I cracked-up. I could not stop washing and I found myself in an old, asylum-type mental
hospital as a voluntary patient. Medication was then crude, and ECT ruled (although I never had it). I was the
only OCD patient, and received ‘chats’ plus intensive chlorpromazine, which confined me to bed, with boils,

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After that, I tried various therapies, for example I spent twelve years under a Freudian psychoanalyst, without success.


Eventually, in 1989, I embarked on behavioural therapy in which people with OCD undergo intensive,
repeated ‘exposure’ to their feared situations without performing rituals, until their anxiety becomes negligible.
This comprised my being an NHS in-patient at a specialist unit, a luxurious environment compared with my
asylum experience of many years before. But the regime was purely behavioural, harshly ignoring patients'
feelings and thoughts. Nevertheless, after nine weeks I left, greatly improved.


However, ten years later, following a stressful period, I relapsed. Seemingly, behavioural therapy trains our will
to stop doing rituals, but it doesn't necessarily cure the residual irrational belief in the need to do them.


Then I discovered BTSTEPS (a telephone based system of behavioural therapy for OCD), provided by
therapists from the same unit in London, on the NHS and with no admission to hospital. It also includes
cognitive therapy (which works with the thoughts/beliefs) if needed to reduce residual irrational beliefs.


The availability of the BTSTEPS' telephone therapist especially helped me. My first therapist, assisted
administratively by his wife, was warm, accepting and so good for my self-esteem that I have, for example,
resumed much more ambitious professional work. Later, a different therapist helped my beliefs through cognitive
therapy. An excellent course that improved me greatly.


Very recently I have been severely ill physically. Following that, my OCD has partially worsened again. Maybe
a further BTSTEPS course is on my horizon.


<i>Conclusion</i>


For me, the worst part of OCD is the secrecy. I hide my illness, for work and social reasons. So, apart from my
partner (God bless him), I avoid close friendships as I can't be open in them.


From my experience, behavioural plus cognitive therapies seem currently the best OCD treatment, but they
don't cure it. They merely make the fears manageable, through an ongoing effort of will (and courage) on the
behaviour and thoughts. Any let-up can produce a relapse. But today there is help.

Daisy's account illustrates important aspects of OCD and how current
self-help methods can help individuals to overcome the problems without
ever having to see a therapist face-to-face. Her most recent (and successful)
self-treatment was guided mostly by a computer system called BTSTEPS,
from which she sought advice at intervals, accessing the computer by
phoning from home (BT refers to behaviour therapy, not a UK phone
company). More on that later.


The first point Daisy makes is how important she has found it since
childhood to keep her OCD secret from friends and employers, so only her
partner knows about her problem. She says she feels she must conceal her
difficulties because she works with patients in a psychological field. Such
shame is a major issue for people who have OCD or other mental health
problems. It explains why most people with anxiety and depressive disorders
who are identified in the community do not get treatment for their problem.
Many employers look askance at job applicants who have a mental health
record, and a record of that kind could sound the death knell for a political
career. Reporters ferret around searching for evidence of‘instability’ with
which to damn candidates, though in fact mild OCD is perfectly compatible
with making an excellent contribution to public life.


Daisy had been distressed by her OCD for decades before she sought
help using behavioural psychotherapy. More public discussion about OCD
and other anxiety disorders would reduce the stigma associated with them
and encourage people to come for help earlier. Getting effective help
early reduces the seriousness of the illness.


The dreaded worries that Daisy writes about so vividly are typical of
OCD. Her thoughts revolved around themes of harming others or herself
unless she carried out particular rituals, including checking and washing,
and avoided contaminating situations and substances. Also classic was
the severity of Daisy's problem — hours of washing and repeated in-patient
admissions. Fortunately she managed to continue working and to have a
partner. Many sufferers lose their jobs and families owing to OCD. They
may spend much of their days and nights engaged in endless and pointless
washing and/or checking, or just sitting in a chair immobile because
getting up from there would start hours of interminable rituals, and they
would be unable to do anything else.


Daisy describes past abortive attempts at treatment, including medication
and twelve years of‘Freudian psychoanalysis’ until she finally improved for

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>BTSTEPS</i>


Daisy's experience with BTSTEPS needs further explanation. She lived
far from the specialist service and never saw a therapist face-to-face. The
first therapist screened her in a phone interview to check that she could
use BTSTEPS. Once found to be suitable, she was posted a self-help
manual and an ID number to phone BTSTEP's computer-guidance
system from the comfort of her home at any time of the day or night. By
pressing keys on her telephone keypad she decided which of 800 different
voice files of individually tailored advice the computer would play for her
to hear.


A central observation of Daisy's is that she stays well by doing relapse
prevention exercises involving exposure and ritual prevention homework
—by facing things she would rather avoid and ‘working on beliefs’, meaning
facing them and the feared consequences of doing so instead of avoiding
them.


Daisy's experience shows that people with OCD can today treat
themselves successfully without having to see a therapist face-to-face. They
can self-treat from home by telephoning for brief advice from a live clinician
and phoning for much longer guidance from an interactive-voice-response
computer system such as BTSTEPS (see Organisations that can Help).

I was happy as a kid. I don't remember it but I have been
told it and can see it in the eyes of the little girl in our
photo albums. Yet with hindsight, an obsessive
personality was formed very early and the seeds of my
anorexia sown at a preciously young age.


On my ninth birthday, I blamed myself for having a
second slice of my favourite chocolate biscuit cake when
I'd caught another sick bug. I remember the absolute
terror of vomiting that gripped me. Away from home I
wouldn't eat strangers' food.


I had problems sleeping too. By the age of nine or
ten, I'd developed a belief that in any environment not
entirely familiar to me, it was not safe to eat or sleep.
Eating would make me physically sick and that was the
worst thing that could happen to me.


I was a high achiever. Not only that, but in
comparison with my naughty little sister, I was also the
‘good girl’ of the family, for which I earned praise,
approval and pride. Being anorexic involves striving to
achieve a state of purity and self-control that far exceeds
what others do and pushes you to extreme limits.
Paradoxically, in trying to be the supremely golden girl
you accidentally make yourself the child from hell.


At the age of eight we moved house and I changed
school, moving into a class of girls a year older than me.
For the first year I was teased about being younger and
brighter than the others, who in their jealousy taunted
me that I smelt and picked my nose.


The greatest blow came when I was a year or so older
and Mum became gradually ill with a chronic and
debilitating neurological condition that crept up on the
family and dealt us several years of trauma. The illness
created an uncertain future in which she could at any
time live or die. With Mum in and out of hospital, I
took over the role of mother in the house and appeared
to cope admirably with cooking, shopping, cleaning
and washing, making sure that all was operating as
normally as possible. In many ways I was being forced
to grow up far ahead of my years and my resistance to
that shows clearly in my anorexia, which was my way of
‘growing down’ at the same time.


I was managing to achieve near stability, through
consistently undereating myself, and overeating under
the supervision of Mum. I was able to go about school
life apparently normally.


My hope was that I would go to university and fit in
so well that weight issues simply vanished. However,
already things were slipping out of anyone's control
and I was obviously ill. I remember the horror of first
seeing the sign on my psychiatrist's door and registering
its significance. He helped me to work with my Mum
to restore some weight so that I was in relatively good
physical shape -although at seventeen I still had not
undergone puberty. We acknowledged the trauma of
Mum's illness and hoped that it was consigned to
history and bundled me off.

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was an anorexic hell. I lasted just over a term. With
regret but also relief I accepted time out and began a brief
period of day care. With Mum's help the weight went
back on, but in my head I had never really connected myself
with the other girls I saw struggling to come to terms with
weight-gain and fighting their illnesses. Family therapy
proved disastrous and so Mum and Dad were not unhappy
with the idea of my returning to university.


So I began again, but nothing had really changed.
Indeed, if anything, my behaviour had become even
further estranged from that of my fellow students.
Somehow I managed to sit my first year exams and did
remarkably well, but it was only a matter of time before
I had to give up a second time.


My family's patience was wearing thin. My sister
could no longer even bear to be in the same room as me
and treated me with absolute contempt. Mum and Dad
rowed about the control Mum tried to impose. It is with
tremendous guilt that I recall all that I have put the
family through.


Life at home was becoming unbearable for all. As my
weight slipped away from me, Mum and Dad tried
increasingly desperately to feed me and I rejected them
more and more. I behaved like a frightened, wild animal
and on several occasions threw platefuls of food around
the kitchen, which had become our battleground. In
desperation one day Mum and I sat in the waiting room
of our GP's surgery and begged for a hospital bed for me.

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I developed eating problems at the age of nineteen when I was at college. I do not intend
to dwell on the various causal factors in detail, but suffice to say that during the summer
of 1976 I went from being a happy teenager to a neurotic, socially withdrawn, desperately
unhappy individual.


I had been weight training for four years, and had built up to around 12st 81b. I was
very strong and, although not all muscle, I certainly was not fat. I never really worried
about food, except to eat fairly healthily, but basically ate whatever I wanted.


During the summer of 1976 I decided to loose some body fat as I had a desire to
become really muscular. I did feel this pressure to be as attractive as possible to the
opposite sex, and so I decided to follow a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates.
At the same time I ‘upped’ my training, and started to work
out every day.


At first I felt much better; I could ‘pose’ in the mirror and
see muscle fibres standing out to attention. My confidence
increased and I drew admiring stares. I selected carefully,
but was still fairly relaxed about food. However, after about
six weeks I noticed that I no longer had this elated feeling.
Instead I became more anxious. Every time I looked in the
mirror, and saw this muscular body, I felt frightened of losing control and losing my
‘new’ body. I also increasingly dwelt on what food I had eaten or was about to eat. These
thoughts permeated my waking day, and started to affect my behaviour.


At first I became distracted for odd moments. Gradually, however, as the anxiety took
hold, these periods increased. I would sit in lectures (I was at teacher training college)
and just couldn't concentrate. Lecturers would ask if I was OK. Of course I said yes. At
this point I realised that my eating and training had become a problem.


Apart from this distraction element, I was becoming obsessive. I had to train. If I missed
a workout I became desperately anxious and thought I would become fat again. I found
that I shied away from social activities as they might make me miss a workout. I also became
increasingly anxious about the food I was eating. I worried if I was forced to eat something
different. I would sit at the table, trying to work out how many calories I was eating. Of
course, while I was doing this, I took no part in conversation, and people, good friends,
asked me if I felt OK — I did feel embarrassed and knew that what I was doing was making
me unhappy, but felt completely unable to help myself. I believed this was the price to pay
for a more muscular body.


On several occasions friends would invite me out, but I found these occasions very
stressful, as I would agonise over menus and felt I was an embarrassment to the others
there. I can remember virtually leaving meals if they came with butter or a sauce, or
sending food back.

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My increasingly bizarre behaviour around food led to me gradually withdrawing
from social situations where food was involved. I spent an increasing amount of time on
my own, and only then felt safe and in control. I preferred to eat alone. Although I was in
a poor financial state, buying my own food was preferable to eating with others, with all
the anxieties and problems it brought.


I did have a girlfriend, but saw very little of her. She obviously knew I was ‘funny’
about food, but never questioned me about it, apart from saying that ‘all this training and
dieting is making you boring’. I knew again that my behaviour and refusal to eat in
public affected our relationship in that we never went out for a meal (except on very rare
occasions and that led me to being stressed all day). Also, my preoccupation with food
mentally and physically exhausted me — I had no energy for anything. I did play the
guitar, but I found that this was merely a distraction to kill time between meals.


After six months I was in the grip of an eating disorder. I could only eat small amounts
of food (although I still exercised obsessively) and spent all my time either on my own or,
when I was in the company of others, I might just as well have been on my own. I became
a food bore! All I would talk about was food, calories and exercise. I was unkind to
people I felt didn't measure up to my idea of physical perfection. This was not me; I
became another person, sullen and withdrawn. The only relief I got was either when I
was asleep or when I was out running or weight-training. For a few moments I would be
relaxed and able to think. However, sooner or later, all my anxieties about what to eat and
how much would descend like a dark cloud.


Although I found socialising around food stressful, I also avoided going out with
friends because I couldn't wear smart well-fitting clothes. I could only wear certain
items of clothing that felt loose, nothing that hugged the body. The result was I looked
like a tramp. Certainly I couldn't have made myself more unattractive.


After a year I was virtually a recluse, venturing out only to lectures or to train. People
stopped asking me if I was OK — they stopped caring. Did they know I had an eating
disorder? Probably, but this was the mid-1970s and most people would not have been
familiar with eating problems.


My recovery took many years because I felt scared of admitting my problems to
anyone, because of fear of being labelled ‘mentally ill’. I found that most areas of my life
had become ritualised, and breaking these compulsions (i.e., exercising or eating certain
products) difficult and stressful. I did find certain activities such as playing the guitar,
which boosted my self-esteem, helped, and this instrument was largely responsible for
my recovery. I began to find that when people complimented me on my music, then all
my fears and thoughts about food and my body melted away. In retrospect my eating
problems and ‘fear of food’ were simply hiding my anxieties and insecurities around
‘me’ as a person. I always felt unworthy and perhaps to a large extent this was down to my

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I also believe that, in addition, I am by nature obsessive—compulsive: I tend to become
obsessive about things. For example, as a small child, I cried if models I made were not
perfect. I possess an incredible amount of will-power, be it in my studies, diet or exercise.
I think that I became ‘high’ on achieving things others couldn't.


Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't exercised or dieted all
those years ago, would I still have developed ‘fear of food’? It is impossible to say, except
that I believe that the dieting acted as a ‘trigger’ to a whole host of feelings and anxieties.
Perhaps if I had drunk alcohol (I am teetotal) then that would have had a similar effect.


Losing my fear of food, in a way, was like losing part of me. I found a big void in my life
that I have now managed to fill with other activities, but it was hard to give it up.


Is someone a schizophrenic or do they have schizophrenia?
Are they a diabetic or a person with diabetes? We try to make
sense of a complex world by drawing conclusions based on
limited information. As a result, we often describe someone
as though they are their illness. It is as if we know all about
them as a person just by knowing their diagnosis. A medical
diagnosis does carry valuable information about what
problems someone is likely to have and what treatment they
need. However, the stereotype we attach to a particular illness
is not only based on medical facts, but also on personal experiences and sometimes
misunderstanding and fear.


What mental picture do you have when you think of someone with an eating disorder?
You may know the symptoms that point to a diagnosis of either anorexia nervosa or bulimia
nervosa, the two most common eating disorders. You will also be influenced by your own
experiences. You may have had an eating disorder yourself, or have met someone with such
an illness. You may also have gained information from the media, family, friends and
colleagues. Our personal stereotypes are a mixture of all these ingredients, but there is a
danger that some of our views are mistaken.


The attitudes and beliefs that lead to the stigmatisation of a mental illness are often
based upon fear. Unlike many physical illnesses, mental illness can affect fundamental
aspects of an individual's personality and behaviour. Sufferers may appear to behave
irrationally and unpredictably. A natural response is to fear what we do not understand.

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What can be even more frightening about people with mental illness is that we might
become like them. We have all looked in a mirror and wished we could change something
about our appearance. Many of us diet to try and lose weight or exercise to improve our
physique. If that wish to mould our bodies became all consuming would we become like
them? We can protect ourselves from this fear by stereotyping people with eating disorders.
It is more comforting to see them as so different from ourselves that we have nothing in
common.


By stereotyping and stigmatising mental illness we strip somoeone of their individuality.
A person with an eating disorder becomes an ‘anorexic’ or a ‘bulimic’, endowed with all
our personal prejudices. These two accounts make it hard to hold such a view. Behind the
starvation and vomiting and exercising is a person struggling to get out. There is someone
with thoughts and feelings who might be like us.


<i>The consequences of stigma</i>


Our personal stereotypes of mental illness may have a basis in fact. Anorexia nervosa is
more common in certain groups, including young Western women in the higher social
classes. The author of ‘Growing up’ would fit into this group. However, there is a danger
that such models blinker us to the possibility of eating disorders occurring in other cultures
and social groups.


This difficulty in recognising an eating disorder that does not conform to expectations
delayed her diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. She had to struggle against the wider views of
society and her own attitudes and fears.


<i>Gender</i>


The author of ‘Eating disorders in men’ has shame about admitting to his illness was
compounded by his gender. When groups of men and women with eating disorders are
questioned there are differences between them, which are reflected in the two accounts.
More often, men have been overweight and may have been teased or bullied for this at
school. By contrast, women have more commonly been at a normal weight before their
illness, but think they are overweight. Men will often focus on body shape rather than
weight. Like the second author, they may pursue a masculine ideal of muscularity. Eating
disorders in men are more common in groups in which athleticism and fitness are valued,
such as army recruits and body-builders. However, at the heart of the eating disorders, the
similarites between men and women are greater than the differences.

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>The heart of the illness</i>


Both authors describe how their illness served an emotional role. For both of them the
eating disorder became a protection against difficult feelings. He initally found a sense of
achievement in the changes in his body, which reduced his feelings of inadequacy. Then a
fear of regaining weight led to his rituals of exercising and starvation. More exercise in an
attempt to build bigger muscles instead led to his body consuming itself for the energy it
needed. However, the emotional pain in stopping was too great to bear and his weight
continued to fall. She found that starvation brought an emotional numbness. It allowed
her to resist growing up, bringing her physical and emotional development to a halt.


We all have to find ways of coping with difficult and painful feelings and to adapt to the
changes that growing up brings. An eating disorder may seem to be the answer to this
problem, but one that is physically dangerous and brings an emotional pain of its own.
However, the way out sometimes appears more painful than living with anorexia or bulimia
nervosa.


<i>Conclusions</i>


Personal experiences are an important way of tackling stigma. These two accounts of life
with an eating disorder are made more effective by their emotional impact. We quickly lose
the idea that eating disorders are all about starving and vomiting; at their heart they are
more to do with difficult and painful feelings. The difference between an ‘anorexic’ and
someone with anorexia nervosa is whether that person is their illness or has that illness.
That is also something that these two people struggled with. Recovering from an eating
disorder required them both to see their illness not as a part of them, but as something they
wanted to be rid of As these accounts vividly describe, that can be a long and painful fight.


More people than ever before are entering higher education, including
significant numbers of people from backgrounds not traditionally
associated with pursuing further education. These include students from
socio-economically disadvantaged communities, ethnic minorities and
from overseas developing countries; and people with physical and
psychological disabilities who previously might not have managed
independently in a competitive academic environment. There are students
entering colleges and universities who are the first members of their family
to pursue higher education.

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although higher education holds out the prospect of significant opportunity, it also
involves a set of challenges that may highlight any vulnerability. Existing emotional
difficulties and psychological disability may hinder the student's transition to independence
and academic achievement, but the stresses of student life may also trigger the emergence
of mental health problems for the first time. Although the student years are viewed as
carefree and self-indulgent by many who have not experienced higher education, and
indeed by some whose memories of college life are distorted by the rosy glow of
retrospection, it is widely recognised that college students face significant challenges.


Students face a complex set of psychological challenges, for which their previous
experiences of family, school and home life may have equipped them to a differing extent.
Most students enter higher education in their late teens, and are still grappling with the
psychological tasks of late adolescence. These include:

academic development

The freedoms resulting from leaving home and school are associated with both
challenges and risks. Self-confidence and self-esteem are key factors influencing a young
person's decisions about the balance between conformity and independence. Psychiatric
disorders, including eating disorders, may be maladaptive expressions of insecurity and
the need for admiration, self-control and mastery.

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mature students may have the advantage of greater life experience than those who enter
college straight from school, but may also face particular financial hardships, the added
difficulties associated with supporting others (particularly children), and specific challenges
to social integration. Mature students may feel less accomplished intellectually and
physically too.


A different set of difficulties may be experienced by foreign students, especially those who are
refugees from their own countries. Many foreign students will be struggling with adjustment to
an unfamiliar language and culture, but refugees may also be suffering psychological reactions
to traumas and losses experienced at home prior to escaping to the relative security of the host
country. Fortunately, in most college communities the essential acceptance and humanitarianism
of fellow students is much more likely to lead to empathic support and concerted efforts to
integrate the refugee student.


The facilities in most universities and colleges for students with physical disabilities
have improved in recent years, but they may face continuing limitations on access to certain
institutions and courses; and physically disabled students must still deal with
incomprehension and prejudice in some academic staff and student peers.


Much less progress has been made towards integrating students with problems of
mental ill health. The potential stresses of higher education may not be adequately
recognised by either the student with a psychiatric illness or the family and professional
staff who support them, until a relapse is precipitated. Indeed, there has been a tendency to
view higher education as a part of rehabilitation for students recovering from a mental
illness. Although the opportunities for study and social integration may be fulfilling and
productive, these students are likely to require sensitive support and continuity of their
mental health care if they do relapse, and the associated interruption to or termination of
studies is to be avoided. For students with existing mental health problems, the transition
from home to college needs to be planned carefully, with active anticipatory liaison between
home and college GPs and mental health services. Vacations, and interruptions to the
programme of study resulting from further illness, require additional liaison as the student
moves backwards and forwards between home and college.


For students who develop a mental illness after starting higher education, systems need
to be in place for identifying emerging problems, providing support and counselling, and
allowing the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness.


Both accounts highlight some relevant themes. Insecurity in childhood may be
associated with low self-esteem and lack of confidence; and, in the competitive environment
of college, this may lead to a sense of inadequacy and unfavourable comparison of self with
others. Second, underlying insecurities are heightened by the perceived loss of family,
childhood friends and the familiar context of home and school, as well as the unfamiliarity
of college life.


In addressing the mental health problems experienced by students in higher education,
academic staff with pastoral responsibilities, college counsellors, GPs and mental health

Eating disorders are illnesses that are generally believed to
affect women, not men. However, with more men now
contacting the Eating Disorders Association (EDA) than in
the past, this has raised the question of what treatment and
services are available for them. The EDA commissioned a
review of specialist health care provision for men with eating
disorders and published the results in February 2000 (EDA,
2000<i>a</i>).


The research aimed to gauge the incidence and prevalence
of eating disorders among men in the UK, based on existing information,
and to establish how specialist services provide for the needs of men with an
eating disorder.


The EDA has long been concerned that investigation into the particular
area of male eating disorder service provision has not been undertaken,
principally because most people with an eating disorder are women. Nicky
Bryant, former Chief Executive of the EDA, explains, ‘As the instigators and
publishers of the key documents on the purchase and provision of treatment
services for eating disorders, we felt it was vital that a group representing
about 10% of the population with an eating disorder should have their
specific needs identified.’ (EDA, 2000<i>b</i>) Although professionals are not
surprised to see men with an eating disorder, they do need to respond
appropriately and effectively to the differing needs and expectations of this
group.


The overall findings identified a number of issues.

<i>Routes into the disorder</i>


As there is less cultural endorsement for slimming among men, the onset of
the eating disorder usually has a specific trigger, for example:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• avoiding childhood bullying or teasing for being overweight
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• body-building or exercise
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• specific occupations, including athletics, dance and horse racing
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• concern of body shape and muscles in men (rather than body
weight, as in women).
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


• avoiding childhood bullying or teasing for being overweight


• body-building or exercise


• specific occupations, including athletics, dance and horse racing


• concern of body shape and muscles in men (rather than body
weight, as in women).


Men with a personal experience of an eating disorder were interviewed
in the course of preparing the report and they raised a number of issues.
The majority reported that their eating disorder had started in their school
years when they were overweight and called names. Several reported being
severely overweight in their younger years for reasons to do with low self-esteem
and crises at home, and difficulties in coming to terms with the
situation. For example, one man had been ten stone at ten years and was put
on a ‘diet’ by the school. This led to him eating on his own and being teased.


The particular pressures in the gay male community to have the ‘body
beautiful’ and ‘be slim in order to get a partner’ were mentioned by the four
gay men interviewed. ‘The scene can be a real meat market.’ One of the men
talked about the difficulties he had in coming to terms with his sexuality as
a Christian and felt this had been a trigger for his eating disorder. The other
gay men talked about the conflicts they had experienced when younger. It
was felt to be a bigger problem in the gay male community than has been
acknowledged, and among some men ‘throwing up’ as a weight control
measure had become a normal way of life.

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One man commented, ‘Most men turn to alcohol and drugs as a method
for coping but for some men an eating disorder is a way of coping with life
stresses.’ Four of the older men had experienced episodes of eating disorders
throughout their lives, in relation to the loss of a partner, a relationship
breakdown, a change of job, the stress of writing a PhD and so on.


Men also experienced particular difficulties discussing their illness with
their peers. One young man commented, ‘It is more difficult to come
forward, you cannot admit to your feelings in a macho culture; people
think you are weak and you fear that you are going to lose respect from your
friends.’


The men were asked about their good and bad experiences of care and
identified issues including easy access to sympathetic professionals who
did not moralise but knew about eating disorders and could provide
specialist help.


Some of the men had received a very prompt response from their GP;
for example, it was a GP who identified that there was a problem with one
of the young men when he saw him in town and referred him to a child
psychiatrist. More commonly there was a lack of recognition by the GP of
the problem or the severity of it, and this led to a delay in getting specialist
help. GPs were seen as crucial, both because they often dealt with the men
on an ongoing basis and because they had the power to make appropriate
referrals and also to issue medical certificates. A number of the men reported
that it was beneficial if the GP took a broader view of life issues, rather that
just dealing with weight issues and doling out medication.


Two of the men had been involved with EDA self-help groups. Others
had either not considered them, because they wanted to put the disorder
behind them, did not know about groups in their area or were wary about
them, for example thinking they might be the only man in the group.


The gay men highlighted the importance of having a visible gay male
contact. One man reported that his partner had helped him a lot. Only one
had experienced any service particularly aimed at men (the men's self-help
group in Newcastle). He reported this as providing useful social support
and reducing the isolation of the disorder. He now keeps in touch with
another member of the group between sessions.

It started with my glasses. We were standing in the hallway, Pauline facing
me with her back to the glass panelled street door. I forget why we were
there, but everything else is firmly implanted in my memory. She stared
at my face in a curious but strangely concentrated way. Then a smile
spread across her own lovely features, and she pointed.


I couldn't make out what she was on about. Had I got a dirty mark on
my face? I turned to look at myself in the hall mirror. No, the same
somewhat dishevelled and perpetually worried expression stared back at
me — no dirty mark or anything unusual.


By this time Pauline was convulsed with laughter. It was good to hear
her laugh. Life, these days, did not often promote such spontaneous
hilarity. Her Alzheimer's had changed so many things — for both of us.


‘Look.’ Her speech was already reduced mainly to single words and
sometimes even these needed a room full of interpreters to understand.
But the ‘look’ and the pointed finger actually touching my glasses now
made it quite clear that it had something to do with my spectacles. I took
them off, inspected them myself and then found Pauline looking deeply
into my eyes, Years ago intimate eye to eye contact like that would have
brought all sorts of notions into my mind that were best not pursued in
narrow hallways. But these things had long since disappeared from our
repertoire of togetherness.


We both examined the glasses still held lightly in my hand. Pauline
touched them again but then lost interest. As I raised them to my face, I
saw the door panel reflected in their curved surface, but, still none the
wiser, I put them on again.


Then Pauline pointed at my glasses again and laughed once more.
‘Peoples’ she said. ‘Litde peoples.’ Two words! Suddenly I understood.
She could see her own silhouette framed by the doorway and miniaturised
on the reflective surface of my glasses. I laughed with her and tried to
explain what she was seeing.


I always tried to explain the things that Alzheimer's prevented her
from sorting out for herself. We held many a one-sided conversation. I
learned to construct short, simple, one topic sentences that Pauline seemed
to understand -some of the time anyway. But I could never be quite sure.


Pauline, like most people in the early stages of dementia, was a great
actor and was able to put on a performance of which any graduate from
RADA would be proud. By acting the part of ‘Pauline — a woman who
had control of all her faculties’, she had, so far, been able to hide from the
casual observer most of the confusions that enveloped and tormented her.

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Over the following days the reflections in my glasses stayed a source of
amused fascination for her. We had many a giggle over them. We usually
both tried to make light of the muddles in which Pauline increasingly
found herself Laughter is a great equaliser. Laughter healed the wound
and the memory of it was soon forgotten — in Pauline's mind at least.
Painful memories seemed to last longer with her.


The reflections in my glasses continued to amuse for only those initial
few days. Slowly amusement changed to concern, the concern to worry,
and then to fear. Sometimes this fear evolved into shear, unadulterated
terror. If I came near her she became frightened, not of me but of those
reflections. Her hand shot out and she tore the glasses from my face and
hurled them across the room. This happened not just once but every time
I went near her. I am lost without my glasses, but I quickly learned to
remove them every time she got within grabbing distance. At least we
were then both in the same blurred and confusing surroundings.


I thought of non-reflective lenses. Were there such things? The
optician told me over the telephone that there were coatings that would
reduce reflections. Come and see our samples. Not as easy as that. We
lived in a village, a twenty-four mile round trip away from the optician
and making arrangements for Pauline's care while I went took a few days
to organise. I did eventually see the sample lenses but by this time Pauline's
fear of reflections had transferred to other things. And life became more
difficult — for both of us.


Mirrors caused panic, their surfaces and inner depths containing
inexplicable terrors for her. I took them all down and stored them in the
spare bedroom. I covered the mirror on the bathroom cabinet with paper.
I stuck it down with masking tape that I planned to lift when I shaved.
But as Pauline followed me everywhere, I was rarely in the bathroom
alone, so I learned to shave ‘blind’ — less bother.


But all kinds of objects hold reflections.


Framed photographs and paintings behind glass had to be removed
and stored. The spare room quickly became an Aladdin's cave of glitter

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Pauline saw reflections everywhere. The TV screen, the shiny plastic
of the toaster and kettle held equal terrors for her. The light reflecting
from the polished wood dining table caused apprehension. I caught her
peering suspiciously at the far less shiny Formica surface of the kitchen
table. It couldn't be trusted to stay that way. It was almost as though she
found some masochistic pleasure in seeking out new reflective surfaces so
that she could first get into a state about them, and then test my ingenuity
in disguising the reflection in some way. Mercifully, for me, as reflections
multiplied around the home, her interest in my glasses subsided. At least
I could see what I was doing as I experimented by coating objects with
Windolene, allowing the resulting chalky surface to dull any chance of it
becoming another object of terror.


Strangely, there was one source of reflection that didn't trouble her, in
fact it became a friend. This was the large square mirror screwed to the
wall between two wardrobes and above a chest of drawers in the run of
fitted furniture in her bedroom.


Pauline stood for hours in front of it talking to the person she saw
reflected there. It was this person who became her friend. The friend was
constant, always there, looked at Pauline, talked with her when Pauline
talked, but had the decency to keep her mouth shut when Pauline wanted
silence. She could share a good joke too. She laughed when Pauline
laughed but when Pauline was sad and cried, she shed a tear as well.
When Pauline wanted to sit quietly on the end of her bed, her friend kept
vigil with her too. If Pauline became animated, her friend reflected the
mood but when this turned to rage at what was happening to her, her
friend instinctively understood and they ranted in unison. When Pauline
wanted to get closer to whisper feminine confidences, her friend
responded and also leant forward for the intimate exchange. They
touched. They held out their hands to each other, fingertip against
fingertip. I was forever wiping the evidence of these physical intimacies
from the mirror's surface.


I should explain one apparent contradiction. Pauline could barely
put two words together that made sense and yet she had these enormously

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

How long? This question frequently crossed
my mind after my husband and I began to
care for my mother.


She had managed to stay in her own home
in Birmingham for five years after my father
died, but eventually her increasing dementia
made this impossible. When she flooded her
bathroom one night we brought her to stay
with us in London, without considering the
long-term implications. Nearly eight years
later, she has just died aged ninety-two.


I am an only child and if we had known
that the caring would go on for so long, the
task might have seemed too daunting. Her
repetitive questions and never having the
house to ourselves all came as a shock.


Soon I had a desperate feeling of being
trapped. As she could not be left alone
overnight, impromptu get-aways became a
thing of the past. Holidays had to be planned
in conjunction with arrangements for her to
be looked after. Suddenly we were even more
restricted than when our children were small,
particularly as my parents had always been
willing babysitters.


To face caring long-term, it is certainly
essential to keep life as ‘normal’ as possible.
As I work from home as a freelance journalist,
at least I did not have to give up my job.


At first we could leave her alone for an
hour or two, though we took the precaution
of having a safety tap put on the gas cooker.
Later came disturbed nights (solved by a
sleeping syrup) and wet beds (ditto by pads).
Fortunately she never wandered out. Indeed,
for the last three years she scarcely even tried
to get out of her chair.

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Our GP arranged for regular ‘respite’ stays
in a special Alzheimer's unit — two weeks
every three months. We could not have
survived without them and my mother hardly
knew the difference.


For several years she was sufficiently ‘with
it’ to attend a centre run by Alzheimer's
Concern Ealing at weekends -a change of
scene for her and a break for us.


Initially she was at her most disturbed and
disturbing in the evenings. Just when it was
time to relax in front of the TV or read a
newspaper, we got a constant barrage of
‘~Where am I?’, ‘Where are you, Gillian?’ and
‘I want to go home.’


No matter how close anybody was sitting
and no matter how much we tried to talk to
her, the droning repetition went on and on,
impossible to ignore. But we were lucky that
she expressed her frustration and anxiety only
in words and never became violent, as some
people with Alzheimer's do.


As her mental health declined, so the daily
routine changed. At first, having been a very
active person, she was constantly asking for
something to do but could only manage
simple tasks like peeling potatoes or washingup.
Though we have a dishwasher I used to
leave a few dishes for her to do. Life became
easier all round when she began to doze off
more.


In her last year, when she could do
nothing for herself, feeding took up the most
time. Though she ate painfully slowly, she
always enjoyed her food. Was this the only
joy left in her life, I wondered? As
conversation was virtually nil by this stage, I
overcame the boredom by reading as I
spooned it in.


People often asked if I found it distressing
to see her getting more and more confused.
Of course I hated losing my lively mother and
no longer being able to have a sensible
conversation with her. But you just have to
get on with the task.


Seeing the funny side is important. One
day I found her chatting to herself in a mirror.
‘I don't know who that lady is but she won't
stop talking to me,’ she complained.


Naturally there were plenty of times when
her slowness and stupidity were so irritating
that I felt like hitting her (actually I only
shouted). But even when she no longer really
knew who we were, I believe she still sensed
familiarity and love. Surely this must have
been a comfort to her.


It is a great consolation to me that we were
able to cope at home right to her peaceful
end. Our three grown-up children were
always willing sitters though I tried not to
impinge on their social life too often as I
would have hated them to regard their
grandmother as a burden. In fact I think they
would have been shocked had I ever
suggested putting her in a home.


But the caring would have been
impossible without my husband, who not
only helped me but was prepared to look
after her himself when I was away. In the last
months he would often pop into her room
to give her a Smartie. When he rattled the
tube she opened her mouth. We knew her
life was fading when she even lost interest
in that.

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I find it very difficult to write
my thoughts on these two
moving accounts of living
with Alzheimer's disease. I
have read and re-read them
many times, and they
remind me of so many people whom I have met while working in old age psychiatry. Yet they're both unique and real.


I found it illuminating, but painful, to read Philip's vivid reflections on caring for his wife. He brings to life the
reality of living with dementia. What it highlighted for me, as a doctor working with families affected by Alzheimer's,
is the way that, as a professional, I can walk away, but as the husband of a woman suffering from Alzheimer's, he cannot.
He is living with the dementia, just as she is. The dementia affects him as well as his wife: it is always there, through
laughter as well as tears, touching every part of their lives. His account confronts me with the reasons why we try, in old
age psychiatry services, to work with couples, families and friends rather than individuals. The illness doesn't affect
individuals in isolation, and to try to treat them as ‘islands’ would be inappropriate: ‘no man (or woman) is an island,
entire of itself’ (Devotions upon Emergent Occasions XVII, John Donne, 1571—1631).


In a different way Gillian makes the same point, as she describes how she and her husband, with support from their
three adult children, coped with caring for her mother as her Alzheimer's progressed. The illness affected the whole
family. They were all involved in it and had views on it. In some ways this makes the work of a professional trying to
help the family more difficult, as the needs of different family members may conflict. As a professional I can join the
family in their struggles to try to find the best ways of coping; different families will choose different ways and our job
is to present the options and support their chosen route, which may or may not be the route that we ourselves would
have chosen.


I salute Philip's inventiveness: the little things he did in order to try and help his wife make sense of her surroundings.
These little things are the ones that make a difference, the things that professionals learn from carers, not from courses,
books or lectures, but which we might be privileged enough to pass on to someone else in a similar situation. These too
are the things that carers can share with one another when they get the opportunity at carers' meetings and support
groups.


Another theme, which Gillian draws out, is that of the remaining joys or pleasures in life. She describes how her
mother enjoyed eating when all else seemed to be gone. Philip's wife found an empathic companion in the mirror.


Gillian cared for her mother until she died and describes that as a great consolation to her. Some carers are unable
to struggle on until the end, and their decision too must be supported and understood: just because their loved-one
goes into care doesn't mean that the relationship is over or that caring has ceased, it just continues differently. Gillian's
philosophy is ‘you just have to get on with the task’. Some people can, but some people can't, and whatever their
circumstances we have to try to help them through. They can still be the carer, even if their relative lives in a nursing
home. They can still care, even when they can no longer bear to see what their loved one has become. Sometimes I think
that not being there is harder than being there.


I can't write more. These pieces speak for themselves, and for the many people I've met in my work so far.


‘Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never seem to know for whom
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.’

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My illness began in the summer of 1992. One particular day stands out in my memory.
I had been to see an Andy Goldsworthy exhibition at Lancaster University with some
friends. As we drove along the sea front afterwards, Steve put on a Jimi Hendrix tape at
full volume. Nick saw my distress at the loud music and put his hand on my shoulder
to console me. It didn't work. I reached over the back of the passenger seat and punched
Steve hard in the back of the head shouting "TURN THE BLOODY MUSIC OFF; I
HATE IT". He screamed out in response "THERE'S NO NEED TO HIT ME".
Then I started a kind of intense sobbing and wailing. John stopped the car and we all
went for a walk on the beach. The rest of the lads started messing about, drawing
around each others' shadows in the sand and taking photos. The loud music became a
big deal to me. I felt very emotionally sensitive, as if I were missing a few layers of skin.
I was also suffering from mild psychosis.


Shortly after I spent a weekend at the WOMAD world music festival at Morecambe.
I became taken over by everything in it; I talked to the musicians and stall holders, and
even strangers in the street, about the music. I totally immersed myself in the experience.
Although extremely hard-up at the time, I spent lots of money on weird and wonderful
ethnic instruments and extra concerts. At the campsite I was in my element. I played the
didgeridoo, the harmonica and the guitar, jamming into the night.


When the weekend was over, I began to form ideas about a new regime for teaching
music; this preoccupation became an obsession, and subsequently a manifestation of
the mania that I displayed in the first phase of my illness. I made copious notes and
diagrams on a system of teaching that I believed could teach anybody how to play
music. I distilled the playing of musical instruments into three categories: plucking,
striking and blowing. Then I proposed simple rhythms to be played in a group, using
my techniques. Next I recorded a tape of myself playing various instruments in rhythms
that started off simply and became more intricate.


Around this time I had introduced myself to a local drumming teacher and music
therapist. I talked to him at length on the phone and even hand-delivered a copy of the
tape to his house very late at night. He confessed to me a few years later that he was very
wary of me as he believed me to be a fanatic. He was right; I was on a mission.


A week later it was my university summer ball and The Pogues were headlining. I
arrived wearing an old charity shop brown suit with a stripy Russian sailor's top and I
carried an old cardboard suitcase containing dozens of copies of my tapes, a military

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One night I was listening to the radio because I couldn't sleep. After about an hour it
hit me. All of what I was hearing on the radio I was meant to hear; it was being said for
me to hear; to help me. All the radio presenters knew my condition and were steering
their conversations in such a way as to give me guidance.


Five hours later I was travelling on a train on my own, when reality came back with a
great thud. Of course the radio didn't broadcast just for me, the presenters didn't know
I existed. What I had experienced that night I can only describe as ‘positive paranoia’. I
believed everything was for me, not that everyone was after me, as in regular paranoia.
Although dysfunctional, this delusory state must be similar to, say, a Buddhist monk
who can only see the good in people. When the folly of this thinking hit me I began to
cry — right there on the train, with all those people watching. All I could think was ‘fuck,
I'm ill’. It was then that I decided things had to change.


I saw a doctor the same day. I told him that I didn't know what was real anymore and
that I knew I was ill and needed someone to understand me. I said I thought I was going
insane. After all, I always was a touch histrionic. He told me that what I was experiencing
at that moment was very common and it didn't mean that I was going insane. He said
that I was, in medical terms ‘hypomanic’; in plain English I was on the cusp of a'nervous
breakdown. Still on the cusp, mind. He told me I had the symptoms of extreme anxiety
and unspecified psychosis. He said that the fact that I knew I was ill was a good sign. He
prescribed me a few doses of temazepam: a tranquilliser that helps your mind to slow
down and allows you to sleep. He told me to return in three days and he would think
about dealing with the psychosis. He told me not to worry too much, ‘I think we've
caught this thing in time and we can nip it in the bud.’


Unfortunately, however, the doctor was wrong. It did get worse and two days later I
was admitted under my own volition to the local psychiatric hospital.
