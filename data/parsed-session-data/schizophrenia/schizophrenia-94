BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So we're talking about problems with mood and that and uh, mood fluctuations.
<b>PT:</b> Well, the thing is after I saw you, remember I felt a little better and then the nurse came and woke me up on Monday.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And what a whiner she was -
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> Because she wouldn't even let me have coffee I said, "Can I at least have a cigarette?"  And then she say "I got asthma" like everybody I know has got asthma, you know, I have COPD and then I don't, she was telling me someone was going to help me over, I can't clean my apartment I have to have the locksmith, he's going to call me today to get those locks in and then I got to get a handyman, they locked everything I can't get the kitchen, the air conditioner's important to save the boxes are by the window, everything's all over there's garbage everywhere, and I'm just, and then I was, she said she was going to send someone over and nobody ever came over to help me put the boxes away.  Then I just can't, I don't know how I'm going to get the laundry up the stairs, most of it's to give away because there's like a 150 pounds of it which I know that they stepped all over and everything and I wanted to wash it before I gave it away.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so did the nurse come to visit you -
<b>PT:</b> And so then I was worse after I saw mother again and she's screaming at me as usually and she asks me questions about what is going on and then I don't want to hear it, I don't want to hear it I can't take it anymore, whenever something happens to me the more often it is the more she can't take it, it's all stressing her out but she starts by asking me a question and then she's like, "I can't hear it, I can't take it, I can't take it anymore."
<b>DR:</b> So did the nurse come to visit you at home?
<b>PT:</b> All she did was take my vitals.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't need someone to come take my vitals I got doctors.
<b>DR:</b> Right we need a little more -
<b>PT:</b> Especially in the morning, of course my blood pressure is low, I just woke up and I wasn't stressed out when I woke up because I'm taking that Geodon now at night to help me sleep even more and my trazodone's on a higher dose, I is, at least I was only taking 150 mg and sometimes I take 300 or 450 mg.
<b>DR:</b> All right, you know you got that letter from the pain clinic, right?  That they're going to dismiss you out of the -
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, I didn't get a letter but I don't care.
<b>DR:</b> So you're not going back there anymore?  So was it [DEIDENTIFIED] or something?
<b>PT:</b> Because you know what?  I have prescriptions for my pain medicine, the Norco and OxyContin, at home -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I think they took them again, they took, they take things then they, they take things they put them back, they take them again and they stole two of my good suitcases and I even know what was in them.  I don't want them looking or anything else because until I'm going to see what's going on until I get these locks in again both of them and -
<b>DR:</b> Right, that's, when the nurse comes I want you to talk to the nurse about it.
<b>PT:</b> She doesn't, she doesn't want to talk, I was smoking a cigarette, I had a seat, she could have sat even though I can't even walk through there.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> They blocked every way to get into the kitchen and I'm falling all over the place.  I know there's cameras in there.  Every time I wake up or go out and come home I, I notice every single thing they do.  And I don't know what their obsession is, I don't know, they're psychotic.  I don't know what their sick obsession is, I don't know if they, they think I'm going to go crazy if they want me to commit suicide or what.  I, I don't know what, what, why their doing it.  I got to get the air conditioner in but she said she was going to send a social worker in to help me pack it because I was so depressed and everything's so much worse and I got to get a handyman over but nobody can do anything until I get stuff out of the way.  And I don't know what, they told me what people are coming over to do, to talk to me, she came over, she didn't even want to talk, I, I thought she knew what was going on and I said something about my leg being burned and she, she didn't even want to know what was going on, she didn't know anything, she didn't come over to talk.
<b>DR:</b> What did she come over to do?
<b>PT:</b> Just to take my vitals and said she was going to send a social worker over -
<b>DR:</b> Social worker, that's good.
<b>PT:</b> But no, that's been two weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Well you need to call her and say where's the social worker.  You need to call and say you'd like that social worker, because I think that's what you really need at home and I think that would be best for you.
<b>PT:</b> Well I don't need a nurse like that.  God, I don't want any, everybody I know that parties, go to bars, smokes pot, smokes cracks, smokes cigarettes, share inhalers, I give my son inhalers all my life so he doesn't have to go to the doctors, I give half of my inhalers because I don't use them all the time.
<b>DR:</b> How's your pain level doing?
<b>PT:</b> It's been pretty bad.  I want to talk to you about my medicine -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because not only am I getting, next week, I'm going to start seeing you every two weeks for a while because of what's going on, I just can't take it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so go on.
<b>PT:</b> So, this is the problem I'm having now, I was wondering if I just didn't give the 10 mg for the time if I should get 7 of the 20s per day because I can't get tired because I fall apart, I have to like just take the medication and go to bed.
<b>DR:</b> You're talking about the Ritalin here?
<b>PT:</b> I can't slowly get tired because I just break down and then I take Ritalin and I'm up all night.
<b>DR:</b> So how about the SR though, you're taking some Ritalin SR.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, 5 but those 10 mg don't seem to do much.
<b>DR:</b> You know again my thought would be what would happen if we took you off that stuff to see how you are without it?
<b>PT:</b> Without Ritalin?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I've been off of it, I've been off of it a couple times.  I've been down to such a low dose, that's one of the reasons I had emergency to see you last time.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Was because I have such a low dose.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, you think -
<b>PT:</b> But I can't get out of bed when I don't have it if I'm on too low of a dose.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Especially now, this is the worse possible time I could be without it.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I mean this is really the worst possible time to be without it because I can't get out of bed and I've stayed not taking any and just because I've been so depressed with it I just wanted to stay in bed and I can't get out of bed if I don't take them.
<b>DR:</b> You still have your Geodon, right?  Twice a day?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I take them both at night.
<b>DR:</b> You got your Lamictal.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Got some refills on that too, got your trazodone to sleep, are you taking your Norco?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, helps for my headaches more than anything, I wanted to tell you this for the longest time forever since I've known you since I've known my orthopedic which has been about the same time when [DEIDENTIFIED] was here, I've been taking Robaxin and chlorzoxazone, what I do is I take chlorzoxazone don't make me that tired it doesn't work as well I take it during the day and I take two at a time sometimes.  The Robaxin is a lot stronger and I take it in the evening and before I go to bed because it makes me tired and it relaxes me a lot better at night.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, you don't have any suicidal thoughts do you?
<b>PT:</b> Just small ones occasionally, not like I did a couple weeks ago when I saw you nothing like that, as long as I stay in touch with you because I don't have anyone else to talk to right now  -
<b>DR:</b> No thoughts of -
<b>PT:</b> Cause my son is just, cause he thinks he knows everything and I [INAUDIBLE] don't talk about anything you don't know anything about.
<b>DR:</b> All right you don't have any thoughts of hurting anyone, do you?  No?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, of course I do!
<b>DR:</b> Like who?
<b>PT:</b> These people!  I'm going to order a knife and I'm going to superglue it to my hand and then if they try to take it out of my hand and I wake up, I'm just going to start slashing.
<b>DR:</b> I don't think anyone's coming in, are they?
<b>PT:</b> Yes they are.
<b>DR:</b> Have you seen them?
<b>PT:</b> Because I know from everything that's misplaced and everything they take out, I'm not walking in my sleep because when I know what I do when I walk in my sleep I always end up leaving food around for some reason I go in the refrigerator and there's food all over the place.  I'm too depressed to even start cleaning myself because I've gotten so bad.  I, everything I buy I, I have to rebuy and rebuy and they take stuff and the other stuff I buy I have to take them out of the box, take all the cellophane off of it like the fan I bought or they'll just take the whole box with them.  I had brand new sheets and they burned them, I know because it was by the foot, I know for a fact that it, oh and then they left crack paraphernalia but they left these rocks that I put in my purse, then they took them out and I know they weren't crack, first of all one was a good size and you wouldn't leave a piece like that out.  I think they took my Ritalin and melted it down.
<b>DR:</b> So you found some crack in your place?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, there was chore on the ground and there was these rocks but they didn't smell like crack at all so I think they melted down some Ritalin and wanted me to find it think they were doing crack and some burnt chore.  And this is not in my head, I mean they took my underwear again for God's sake and I, I can't, until I get these locks I really can't buy anything.  I can't wait to the get the laundry tomorrow I hope, but I really can't buy anything unless I have to have it, I've spent so much money, I spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars buying the same stuff over and over again.  And cleaning supplies are expensive, I must have had six drills stolen, Black and Decker drills stolen.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if they got in through the front door since it wasn't double sided, I'm thinking they got some kind of magnet.
<b>DR:</b> How about getting some roommates, ever think of that?
<b>PT:</b> I just moved here and I really like it -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> It's not that, I'd be fine, I love the apartment and I was really happy, I was looking forward to get these locks put in and I love the apartment and I, I called the guy, he going to call me back later today and as see, as soon as he can get over and put these other locks in again.  My mother gave me the money.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm praying that they work because then I'll be okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay so are you saying you need more of the Ritalin?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh I do because I forgot, the reason I do is because they didn't um, they only gave me like 12 days worth, that's all they had.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And then the other one, well then I didn't have that many of them and I was taking a bunch of the other ones.
<b>DR:</b> So how many would you like?
<b>PT:</b> Well I think I figure I might as well get a month if they have that but I'm going to see you in two weeks anyway.
<b>DR:</b> Right but how many are you asking for of the 10s?
<b>PT:</b> Well, of the 10s?  I was thinking of just saying, taking one more 20s and not many 10s.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well those are just sustained release ones.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But you're already on a high dose of that.  You're taking 5 a day.
<b>PT:</b> Well the 10 mg don't seem like they, they're that strong for me to take in the evening.
<b>DR:</b> You have your Effexor and your Geodon and your Lamictal, trazodone, Chantix, Parafon Forte.  Is it just that you low of energy or is that you -
<b>PT:</b> It's both, it's mentally and physically.  When my mother has me do something it's always, I was so stressed out that day, I was up at 6:00 in the morning paying my bills and I didn't even get everything done and then I had a check her MasterCard because some stuff that was ordered got on her charge card and she's blaming me for it when I had nothing to do with it, well you know she blames me for everything.  Everything is my fault I do it all on purpose and I'm a liar and whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> She's like, "All right, I finally believe you, all right I finally believe you."  She said she believed me then she said she didn't, now she believes me again about what's going on because my phone bill one month was $300, next month it was $800 and I don't make that many calls.
<b>DR:</b> Right, that's a lot of calls.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So the only thing you need today is some Ritalin, is that right?
<b>PT:</b> No because I won't see you for two weeks so I need the Valium, the chlorzoxazone, the Robaxin and the OxyContin, those will be filled next week.  The Robaxin and OxyContin -
<b>DR:</b> The Valium we gave you on the 29th of May -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah well I've taken extra of those because of the stress.
<b>DR:</b> So how many are you taking?
<b>PT:</b> Six a day.
<b>DR:</b> And Parafon Forte you're taking how many?
<b>PT:</b> Three a day, sometimes I take two, sometimes I take four.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, you do have a refill on that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah I do, but then I take the OxyContin next week and the Robaxin 750 I take in the evening and at night before bed.  Those work a lot better it's just that they make me tired, I can't take those during the day.  I've been taking most of these for the longest time like that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, we'll get you some more Valium, so you need Valium and what else do you need today?
<b>PT:</b> I need the Ritalin.
<b>DR:</b> Okay now on the [DATE] you filled that, right?
<b>PT:</b> But I didn't get them all, do you want to see the bottle?
<b>DR:</b> How many did you get, yeah show me what you got.
<b>PT:</b> I took the last ones today.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they only gave you 70.  Wonder why, they run out of them or what happened?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I'm going to go to Walgreens they always have them.  The pen's running out.
<b>DR:</b> Okay well I'm going to fill that for you.  Do you have the regular ones?
<b>PT:</b> No because I was taking um, more of those because I don't know.  I just felt like I needed a higher dose because every time I get more depressed if I take more I'm not as depressed.  If I start crying or something then I'll want to take more  10 mg.  I'm tired of crying myself to bed, I did that for years I cried myself to bed.  I'm just, sometimes I want to stay up -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because I, I want to stay up to see if they're going to come over.
<b>DR:</b> Well you need to get some sleep.
<b>PT:</b> I do, I sleep during the day then.  I slept all day, not yesterday the day before I slept all day.  They have different ones at [DEIDENTIFIED] then they have at Walgreens.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> You ever take pictures of these people?
<b>PT:</b> You know what, I'm wondering, I need my computer up to get, I cannot for the life of me I don't know where these cameras are.  But every time I put stuff away or I hid stuff that I want they take it and like throw it on my bed or put it right next to my bed or my [INAUDIBLE] it's we found it, you know?  It's like they're playing games, they're just playing games.  And I, if there's cameras I don't want them to see me crying then I think they will do it even more.  I don't think they've been doing it as much this last week.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's good.
<b>PT:</b> I wrote a letter to them, I said thanks for putting some jeans and shorts back, I said what the hell's wrong with you for this and that then I said thanks for putting some jeans and shorts back.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> And so it's like they know I know now that I know that they're in there, you know?
<b>DR:</b> Sure.  That's for you.
<b>PT:</b> For some reason there's um, for some reason I just don't think they've been coming in here that often.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe they're going away now.
<b>PT:</b> I think they're getting tired of it because you know what?  See if I start packing my stuff, they've messed that stuff up so bad I don't think I can do anymore.  When I start packing my stuff in the closets and stuff I think that's when they're going to start again so I'm waiting to get the locks in before I do it.  Oh, I need the OxyContin and the Robaxin for next week.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you do?
<b>PT:</b> I don't remember when you gave me those other OxyContin but evidently I didn't need them.  On the knock -
<b>DR:</b> So what kind of OxyContin do you need now?
<b>PT:</b> Well I, oh, uh, I see when the do, what I'm taking now we'll talk about that another time.
<b>DR:</b> Which is what?
<b>PT:</b> The 50 mg twice a day.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, now where are you getting the Robaxin from?
<b>PT:</b> Walgreens, I get both of them there.
<b>DR:</b> Who wrote your last Robaxin script?
<b>PT:</b> All my pain doctors have wrote them.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.  How much Robaxin where you taking?
<b>PT:</b> A t.i.d.  750.  I mean the chlorzoxazone is weak compared to those but they don't make me tired so if I need them during the day I take one or two.  It's like I need the Ritalin but then I need some to off set some of the stress.  It's just how it works for me.  Sometimes I'm not as stressed on it but with what's going on I've been a lot more stressed.  I mean after they burned my leg -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Then I freaked out.  You can tell it was with a lighter look at how it's up and down, this was all charred in here, these were blisters.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah it seems like it's healing.
<b>PT:</b> It is healing.  I started scratching it.  It was black, it was just charred.  These were just little blisters.  I mean how sick is that?  After that happened I had a, just freaked out.  All the phone numbers that I had and now I don't have any phone numbers at all.  I'm going to have them hold on to these at the pharmacy because otherwise I don't want them to get a hold of them.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, don't lose them, if you lose them I cannot replace these.
<b>PT:</b> No, I know I going to, to have them leave them at the pharmacy definitely.  Do I have refills on everything else?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you should.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm supposed to call the nurse up?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, tell her that you want to see the social worker.  Have the social worker come to visit you.
<b>PT:</b> Well she said she was sending someone over and no one ever came and it's been two weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Right, yeah we'll pick this up late -
