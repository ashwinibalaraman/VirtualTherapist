<b><i>W</i></b>hen I was eighteen my parents were faced with a problem:
what to do with a sullen, disorganized daughter
who had failed to graduate high school and who had returned
home to Washington, D.C., wrists bandaged, from an extended
stay with her boyfriend's mother in Indianapolis. They took me in
tow to the psychiatrist I'd been seeing off and on through my high
school years, who recommended that I spend some time in a
"therapeutic environment." He suggested Austen Riggs, a hospital
in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where patients--none of them too
sick, he reassured us--were free to come and go, and where I
might spend some months away from the immediate source of my
confusion, the boyfriend and his mother.


I stayed at Riggs for three years, one as an inpatient, two as an
outpatient, living in apartments with various roommates. These
were years I should have been in college, and they were so empty
and aimless that when I remember Riggs now, my mind pans
around the corridors of the big comfortable patient residence, the

[p. <i>4</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Riggs was an anachronistic institution even then. (I often wonder
what it's like there now; the patients are a lot sicker, I'm told, and
they stay for shorter periods of time.) The population was very
young, very bored. A few middle-aged people were there, but we
younger ones tended to avoid them. They looked baggy and
defeated, truly sad in a way we sensed had more to do with life than
diagnostic categories. Years later, when I actually went to college, I
read <i>The Magic Mountain</i> in a seminar, and I felt I had a certain
advantage over the other students. How well my Riggs experience
prepared me to understand the convalescent languors of the tuberculosis
patients, reclining on their deck chairs, blankets draped over
their knees, eves fixed on the middle distance. Now, whenever I see
one of those chairs, the white-painted wooden Adirondack type that
seem to show up in soft-focus lithographs on the walls of so many
doctors' offices, I feel a familiar jelly-limbed ennui.


My suicidal gesture had been feeble, a few swipes with a pair
of nail scissors. I knew when I arrived at Riggs that I was quite sane

[p. <i>5</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I arrived excited; going to Riggs was the fulfillment of an adolescent
fantasy. The status of mental patient would invest me with significance.
The frantic little act that landed me there had been my
entr√©e to a process; life would work on me in this particularly colorful
way, and who knew what might happen? Riggs had a special
interest for me because by coincidence I had spent some time hanging
around there at age fifteen, when I visited the home of my friend
Caroline, whose father was the financial manager of the institution.
We had seen the movie <i>David and Lisa</i>, a tearjerker about a love
affair between two adolescent mental patients, and we were smitten
with the romance of madness. I think we believed that if we cultivated
dissociation we would become as beautiful as Lisa: Our complexions
would turn luminous, our faces grow expressive hollows,
our hair lie flat and glossy. We spent our days edging cautiously
around the grounds, taking drags on shared cigarettes and muttering
"a touch can kill," hoping to be noticed by the patients, drawn into
their glamorous orbit by the magic of proximity. The patients frustrated
us by staying indoors, their windows open to the July breezes,
playing "Mockingbird" on their stereos. We heard this song constantly,
from multiple windows under which we passed, and for us
its refrain became the perverse anthem of mental illness:


<i>Mock, yeah!</i>


<i>Ing, yeah!</i>


<i>Bird, yeah!</i>


<i>Yeah, yeah!</i>


<i>Mock-ing-bird!</i>

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When the psychiatrist in Washington recommended that I be
sent to Riggs, I quivered inwardly, afraid to blow it all by showing
my pleasure, and the moment I got home and free of my parents I
called Caroline long-distance." Guess what?" I whispered. "Guess
where I'm going?" Caroline was going to college, but I was going
to Riggs, and I knew by the envy in her voice that I had doubletrumped her.


At community meetings patients sat cross-legged on couches, or lay
sprawled on the carpet, and were encouraged to ventilate their feelings
by the nurses and a small, round-eyed man named Richard, a
nondoctor whose function I couldn't understand at first, a kind of
professional gadfly and controversialist. Years later I found a category
for him; he was a protofacilitator, perhaps the first of his kind to
emerge from the fledgling family-systems school of psychiatry.


These meetings, meals, and therapy sessions were the only real
structure of our days. We were assigned tasks, called "work-jobs," in
the mornings, but most patients slept through the hour reserved for
them. It felt a little gratuitous to spend an hour sponging down baseboards
when that hour was being charged to one's account. The
issues of work-jobs and DNR, or day-night reversal (this was the late
1960s, and already we were using acronyms--Riggs was both
anachronistic and ahead of its time) were the staples of discussion at
community meetings--not so much discussion, really, as nagging
and resistance. The nurses and the protofacilitator kept after us.
Why couldn't we take pride in our environment? Could we get to
the bottom of this, please? The patients sank deeper into silence and
into the contorted positions young bodies assume in shamed repose.


The essential passivity of life at Riggs, a life lived to be examined
in therapy, worked against the staff's attempts to get us to clean up

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Not all of us were normal late adolescents. Some were seriously
depressed, not just sluggish. Some were harmlessly odd, like L, a
lapsed seminarian who carried on a constant internal debate about
the supremacy of the papacy. He would emerge from his room to
keep a running score on the blackboard above the mailboxes--L 24,
Pope 17. Some of the elderly outpatients seemed beyond hope. The
parameters of their worlds shrank as they aged; their compulsiveness
stiffened. Never quite accepted by the townspeople, they shuffled up
and down Main Street, stopping for the lunch special at the drugstore,
ducking into the library for a nap.


A few patients were mad. I recall two in the early days of my stay
there; one somehow got her hands on an antique cannon, fiddled
with it to make it operational, and fired it out her bedroom window.
She also pulled a gun on her therapist, made him plead for his life.
The other, a young man who could have doubled for Charles

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Still, making allowance for the effects of idleness and boredom,
I think most Riggs patients were much like people in the outside
world. Graduate students, for example, don't seem much saner as a
group, or even much happier. The striking difference between Riggs
patients and comparable young people living outside was that Riggs
patients were richer. I believe I came from the least wealthy family
of any patient while I was there.


My mother delivered me to Riggs. She spent the first night with
me in the local guest house. We were shown into our room, with
its flounced twin beds and space heater, its view of Stockbridge's
famous Main Street, the one painted by Norman Rockwell. She
closed the door and took her flask from her purse. "I guess the
sun's over the yardarm," she said.


The next morning was frosty and bright; we said our farewells in
the parking lot of the therapy building, and she alarmed me by bursting
into tears, very uncharacteristic behavior. "Goodbye, my dear,"
she said, and clutched me. The sun bounced off the lenses of her
dark glasses and blazed in car windshields. I remember staring over
her shoulder blankly, eager to see her go, eager to get started.


I was led from office to office in the warren of small rooms in
the basement of the therapy building, tested and interviewed by
five or six of the psychiatrists on staff. I was given the standard
Wechsler intelligence quotient test for adults. (What is the Koran?
What does the following quotation mean: "A single swallow does
not a summer make?" Assemble these blocks so that the result
exactly reproduces the pattern in this booklet. Tell me a story that
explains this picture--a boy stands at the head of the stairs, a broken

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When my diagnostic workup was complete, I became the subject
of a full-dress staff conference in which my prognosis was discussed
and my treatment plan drawn up. I think I may have been
the last patient at Riggs to be brought into her own conference.
The custom was dropped, probably because it had an unenlightened,
nineteenth-century feel about it.


I remember entering that room, led in by a nurse, shown to a
chair at the head of a polished oval table that seemed to me the size
of a fishing boat. The nurse withdrew. Seated there, looking down
the rows of faces that looked back inquiringly into mine, I was visited
with an impulse to say, "Perhaps you gentlemen were wondering
why I called you all together today." That made me smirk inappropriately.
"Emily," said one of the doctors, "I'm interested in this
detached feeling you described in your interview--that floating, disengaged
sensation. Are you feeling that way right now?"


"I guess I am," I said, and I lifted my lowered eyes to hazard a
smile at the assembled doctors. They smiled back encouragingly,
and at that moment I felt a desolate certainty that now there
would be no backing out. Now I had left home for good.


I was a hog for attention and welcomed nearly any kind, but the
doctors' questions, the nurses' charting of my moods and actions,
all this had the feel of the speculum about it.


Within a few months, though, the staff's vigilance had dissipated,
and I took my place among the other patients, lounging on the leather
sofas in the entrance hall, ashtray balanced on my knee, running my

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was assigned to a therapist, a research psychologist. I learned
later that I was only his second clinical patient. He was a man in his
middle thirties, amiable, earnest, eager. He had a spade-shaped,
high-cheekboned, luminous face--a beautiful face, really--that sat
at an odd angle to his neck, a disc facing up rather than out, and he
stood rocked forward on his toes, his shoulders so hunched they
were nearly level with his ears. My adolescent sensors instantly registered
something alien and slightly goony in his aspect, and I never
fully accepted him. Now I understand him better; experience has
provided me with a context into which I can place him. He came
from the Bronx, a <i>yeshiva bucher</i> from a Yiddish-speaking household.
When I think of him now, I put a yarmulke on his balding
head and append Hassidic curls to his temples, and I see his face as
a throwback to visionary and ecstatic ancestors.


I was retested a year after I arrived, and my IQ had declined significantly--how much,
my therapist wouldn't tell me. He would
only say the test results were "disappointing." My diagnosis was
altered. Now my anxiety neurosis had become a "schizoid personality
disorder with borderline trends." This is a bad diagnosis, and an
insulting one, I've been told since, but at the time I rather liked the
sound of "borderline trends." It made me think of a stylish flourish,
an extra, like piping on a jacket or whitewall tires on a car.


Apathy wasted us. I had been a failure as a student, but I had
always read voraciously. At Riggs I stopped. We lost our normal adolescent
interest in sex--for the most part, at least. We hung out in

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Many of us got worse rather than better, and for some, getting
worse was dangerous. By the time some patients ran out of money,
and this was bound to happen eventually, even to the multimillion-dollar
trust-funders, their parents and doctors had come to view
them as too debilitated to go back into the world. Instead they
moved on to state institutions, where sometimes they stayed for life.


Toward the end of my first year as a Riggs patient, my therapist
became inappropriately attached to me. Our meetings were
charged with feeling, and every session seemed to end in an
epiphany. But it was Dr. S's eyes that beaded with tears, not mine.
My parents, we acknowledged in therapy, had rejected and abandoned me.
I had known this for years, but pretended it was a revelation
because I found his emotion too gratifying not to play on. At the
same time, I felt itchy and uncomfortable, instantly sated with his
love, made queasy by it. I'm not sure whether this was because I felt
myself to be in bad faith or whether I was unaccustomed to this kind
of moony empathy, this cherishing pity. I was not the kind of young
girl a lot of men fell in love with. And I always felt that the object of

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Thank you," I would say as we paused at the door of his office at
the end of an hour. "No, thank <i>you</i>," Dr. S said. I had opened up the
world of feeling for him, he told me. The years of charts and statistics
and rat mazes were over for him now. We began to take walks on
autumn days. Dr. S taught me to drive and accompanied me when
I took my driving test. I taught him to smoke cigarettes.


Around the time Dr. S's wife was due to deliver a baby, I became
an outpatient. Dr. S began to appear at my door. One evening we
drank a lot of wine, he and my roommate and I, and we all took a
tipsy walk after dinner. Dr. S put his arm around my waist. This was
the first physical contact between us, and the only, but it changed
things unalterably. I woke the next morning charged with a theatrical
anger and teased by doubts about its legitimacy.


In therapy I remained mostly silent after this incident, and
glared. Dr. S became frantic. He told me one day that he had spent
the morning weeping in his parked car on a farm road in Lenox, one
of the routes we often took on our drives. Hearing this confession
puffed me up with scorn like a blowfish. I was thrilled and enraged.
Inwardly, I felt some alarm at this reaction; it seemed partly out of
my control. My disgust at Dr. S had something to do with the way
his clammy feelings for me entwined with professional ambition--
at my second staff conference he presented our work together as a
new way of doing therapy in which the therapist makes himself vulnerable,
fully embraces his own transference, drops his therapeutic
distance. A triumph, except for my unfortunate deterioration, documented
in testing. But that was easily finessed with the familiar psychoanalytic
rationalization that explains an increase in symptoms as

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was witnessing the final collapse of adult authority, and my
anger was a cover for fear. But it also served to conceal a kind of
sexual frustration. I think my semiconscious thought process went
something like this: If I'm going to do something so extreme and
destructive as to have an affair with my married therapist, I want
him to be so powerful, so seductive, that my culpability is washed
away. I want his passion to overwhelm me and leave me blameless.
But Dr. S's feeling for me was more emotional than sexual,
more tender than passionate. I could feel a smug slackness in the
arm that encircled my waist, tentativeness in his dangling fingers
as they brushed against my hip, and it made me mad. I never fully
acknowledged this to myself at the time. But let me give my former
self the highly qualified credit she deserves; my self-suspicion
was like a thready, persistent extra pulse.


I began an unsystematic search for a new therapist, approaching
doctors who looked sympathetic and explaining guardedly that I felt
I would do better with somebody more experienced than Dr. S. The
answer was always the same: This is an issue to be worked out in
therapy.


The new director arrived, startling us all with his appearance. He
was tall and bony, with a comic villain's brilliantined black hair
and a waist that seemed to begin six inches below his lantern jaw.
He wore cowboy boots and string ties, and he brought with him a
bevy of beautiful psychotic young girls from the hospital he had
directed in Washington, D.C. He was a swashbuckler, a florid,

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But those girls! They were like a team of NBA all-stars trooping
in to watch a junior college practice. They quickly showed us their
tricks: One inserted needles in the pupils of her eyes; another plastered
her face with chalky makeup and walked around the Inn with
her eyes closed and arms extended, a Kabuki somnambulist. A third
became a member of my therapy group (Subgroup C), and she
enlivened the proceedings by screaming at unpredictable intervals,
full-throated operatic screams that lasted for fifteen seconds. The
arrival of these girls precipitated an avalanche of competitive upsets
among the patients, and the nurses had their hands full for a few
months. Then these patients, too, "settled in," being human as well
as mad.


Dr. Leslie Farber came to Riggs with the new administration. He
was an old friend of the director, who lured him with promises of
time to spend on his writing. I first saw him when he visited our
community meeting, which began with the usual nagging by the
nurses and Richard about the work-jobs left undone, the unwholesome
hour at which most of the inpatients had gone to bed, followed
by the usual silence and then the dribble of patient complaints. Sue
M, the lanky Floridian, wanted to know why scrambled eggs could
not be substituted for the food offered at every meal, not just break-fast.
Howard Z, a new patient housed in the east wing of the Inn,
complained that trucks making early morning deliveries to the
kitchen were waking him.


Diana D spoke next, from her cross-legged position on the
floor, leaning forward from the waist, arching her neck and gesturing

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"We're listening, Diana," said Richard. "We want to hear what
you have to say."


Diana hesitated. "It's the outpatients," she said. "The outpatients
are making me depressed. Especially John Haviland. I wish
he didn't have to come into the Inn. I wish he didn't have to eat
with us. He's so depressing, the way he eats." John Haviland, wearing
a soiled windbreaker, looked up from the piano bench by the
window. He was a little man with a built-up shoe. He was often
the object of imitations by the late-night crew in the patient
kitchen; stuffing a roll of toilet paper down the front of one's pants
and locking one knee helped to evoke his off-center lumpiness
and his fractured gait. "When they're around, the older ones, I
feel like that's how I'm going to end up, and I don't want to have
to look at that. I don't really think I should have to."


I had been stealing looks at Dr. Farber, who sat quietly in the
wing chair by the fireplace. I had noted that he was slightlyplump,
balding, and middle-aged, with an elfin-Semitic face and
an air of masculine elegance that none of his constituent physical
parts accounted for. (Later I learned from him how he felt about
his embodiment: "a fat little Jewish dentist," he said, quoting a former patient.)
In the silence after Diana's remarks, I slid my eyes in
his direction again and saw on his face an unmistakable expression
of shocked contempt. His eyebrows were arched, his lip
curled, his nostrils distended.

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This look jolted me. I knew instantly that Dr. Farber was a different
kind of being from the other therapists. His was not the
neutral watchfulness I had become so used to; he judged, and
revealed his judgment. This was striking enough, but it was really
just the first layer of my reaction. I also sensed, if obscurely, that
he was a person whose way of looking at the world--unlike that of
any therapist I had encountered--was integrated with, and undetachable
from, his self.


I learned later that Dr. Farber was well known not only in psychoanalytic
circles but in the wider intellectual world as well. He
was a maverick, humane and cultivated, who challenged his colleagues
to confront what the science of psychology had refused to
acknowledge--the inextinguishable presence of will in human
behavior.


In one of his essays Dr. Farber compared the psychoanalyst to
Kierkegaard's "systematizer," a man who has spent decades building
a splendid mansion, a great multistoried edifice with wings
flung out in every direction. But when the man has finally completed
his dream house, he settles contentedly into a shack next
door. In Dr. Farber's view, the house of psychoanalysis was
impressive but unfit for human habitation.


Dr. Farber's face, its expression that afternoon, was a life lesson
for me, the first I had received since I willingly immured myself at
Riggs, a very dense, impacted lesson that I would spend years
absorbing and have yet to learn completely.


I made an appointment with Dr. Farber immediately, and once
seated in his office I wasted no time in blurting out the story of Dr.
S and the driving lessons and the baby Mrs. S had just given birth to
and the arm around my waist and his tears. I felt some terror as I
spoke; Dr. Farber's dour expression was not encouraging. He heard

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Next Dr. Farber startled me by asking what I thought of Washington,
D.C. He had just come from there, he said, and he had
noticed a Washington address in my file. I stalled, floundered.
What could this question mean? Finally I said that I liked Washington,
although it was kind of a weird city. He nodded gravely. It
<i>is</i> kind of weird, and I like it too, he said. He added that he was
having some trouble adjusting to Stockbridge. Did anybody actually
work around here, or were the townspeople all models for
Norman Rockwell? I laughed explosively. A joke!


We went on to talk about other subjects. Poetry: Did I like John
Crowe Ransom, a special enthusiasm of his? Yes, I did, I replied,
although I had never read or heard of John Crowe Ransom. Dr. Farber
stubbed out his Camel and propelled himself headlong out of
his chair so abruptly that for a moment I feared he was having a
seizure. He rummaged in one of the cardboard boxes that surrounded
his desk--he was still unpacking his library--and drew out
a book. He tossed it to me, and I caught it two-handed. Take it, he
said. You can return it when you come back to talk to me next week.
He moved to the door and opened it. What about therapy? I asked,
rising from my seat. Do without therapy for a while, he said, ushering
me out. Just come back next week and we'll talk.


My father was understandably outraged when he learned that I
had gone without therapy for three weeks. Just talking, he shouted

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I read the Ransom anxiously, preparing myself to be quizzed,
but when I awkwardly rose from my chair in Dr. Farber's office to
hand back the book--even the simplest physical transactions
between patient and therapist made me self-conscious--Dr. Farber
took it, opened and leafed through it, reading passages aloud
in his fine deep voice, smiling, shaking his head in confounded
admiration. "The curse of hell upon the sleek upstart," he read,
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>That got the Captain finally on his back<br />
And took the red red vitals of his heart<br />
And made the kites to whet their beaks clack clack</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>
(I copy these lines from the same Vintage paperback Dr. Farber
threw at me more than thirty years ago, one of many books he lent
me and that I never returned.) Involuntarily, in a burst of delight,
I clapped my hands and repeated "clack clack." I blushed. Dr.
Farber smiled his odd, wounded smile, and we lapsed into a long,
for me unnerving, appreciative silence.


<i>That got the Captain finally on his back<br />
And took the red red vitals of his heart<br />
And made the kites to whet their beaks clack clack</i>.


I was desperately eager to please Dr. Farber, but the open-endedness
of our arrangement made me so anxious that my conversational
timing was thrown off. I sensed that he was wavering in his
refusal to accept me as a patient, that I was being auditioned, and the
more urgently I wished to pass this obscure test, the more clumsy
and aggressive my efforts to win him became. Too shy and fearful of
rejection to plead, I sometimes veered off into truculence, imposed
my own attention-demanding silences. I wanted to talk about Dr. S,
my parents, myself. So we talked about these things, but in a novel
kind of way. I told him the particulars of the mess that had precipitated

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Did I like Joanne Woodward? This one came from far left
field. Did I? I asked myself, and rummaged frantically in the
underused opinion-forming sector of my mind. Finding no ready-made
response, I asked myself what movies I had seen in which
Joanne Woodward appeared. I knew I'd seen some, but my memory
was clouded and roiled with anxiety. I called up an image of
Joanne Woodward's face. Yes, I said. It's her face I like. It's plain
and handsome at the same time. It's very direct. Yes, said Dr. Farber,
with gratifying emphasis. That's the thing about her, all right.
And we went on to talk about Joanne Woodward movies, a few of
which, now that I had relaxed, bobbed up naturally onto the surface
of my recollection.


Thus does the despairer appear before us to ask that most
extraordinary and truly diabolical question--especially when
addressed to a psychotherapist--"is there any good in talking?"

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This passage comes from Dr. Farber's essay "Despair and the
Life of Suicide," and it describes exactly the experience of therapy--
or friendship; for him the two were inseparable--with Dr. Farber.
"The real world of discourse"--this is where we are all free to live
when we live outside of systems, but I had lived inside one for a long
time. Years of psychotherapy had made me smoothly practiced at
collapsing into my components, exposing them for convenient
inspection on cue. I had learned to "assume the position" so automatically
that Dr. Farber's requirement that I come to our talks as
pulled together as possible--ready to exercise judgment, to make
distinctions, to listen and respond, to view myself first as a moral and
then a psychological being, most important, to tell the truth; to
accept the high value he placed on tact, empathy, intellectual substance,
wit--all this bewildered me at first. It bewildered me later
too. In fact, it bewilders me now all over again, having lived for nearly

The patient or friend in this passage is in despair, for Dr. Farber
a very specific state, which he vividly describes and carefully documents
as a drastic spiritual condition that presents its sufferer with an
opportunity for redemption at the same time that it provides "fertile
soil" for the "intrigues" of suicide." What bothers me when I read
this passage is a nagging sense that, at least while I was a patient at
Riggs, I never was the patient or friend of whom Dr. Farber speaks
here. "[D]espair seems to afflict only those whose relation to life is a
serious and potentially responsible one," he remarks later in his
essay. I hope I was "potentially responsible," but I don't believe I was
"serious" in the way Dr. Farber's hypothetical friend was serious.
Despair was not my condition; neediness was. In fact, from my perspective
now, in middle age, the story of my attachment to Dr. Farber
would seem drawn more likely from the annals of primatology
than from philosophy or theology (the latter was Dr. Farber's real
stomping ground). It seems plain to me now that while I felt the
purest and most ardent admiration for him that I had ever felt for
anybody, I was also an unprotected young female trying to find
refuge in the care of a "silverback," a dominant male.


Dr. Farber was extremely sedentary; his idea of exercise was to fumble
energetically for his lighter when it fell between the cushions of
his red leather chair. Now that he and his family had moved to the
country, his wife persuaded him to buy a bike and ride it to Riggs in
the morning. He fell off the bicycle almost immediately, cracked a
rib and broke an arm.


He sat uncomfortably upright, twisted to shield his injured right
side from collisions with the arm of his chair, lighting his innumerable

The next week he greeted me with warmth. His arm was still
in a sling, but he looked much better. At the end of the hour he
announced almost casually that a space had opened up and he
would, after all, be able to take me on as a patient.


Dr. Farber insisted that I have a final, civil talk with Dr. S. I
protested that I was too angry at Dr. S to speak to him. Dr. Farber
suggested that I consider the connection between guilt and anger.
I countered with genuine indignation that Dr. S was far more
guilty than I. Dr. Farber allowed that, and observed that the
greater guilt did not completely mitigate the lesser. I made the
appointment and spent an hour with Dr. S. I think he cried, and I
do remember walking into his office with the sullen air of a child
forced by adults to apologize. Now I want to say to my former self:
You didn't need to apologize, you dolt! You needed to ask to see
the baby pictures, and to say good-bye.


I had come to view guilt as a noxious psychic by-product, something
to be gotten rid of in the interest of health. It took me a while to grasp
that Dr. Farber's idea was different: For him guilt was real. It was a
moral state rather than a psychological condition.


Dr. Farber's attitude toward me was never the "unconditional
positive regard" with which therapists are charged to view their
patients. His regard was highly qualified and partial, and it was as
real as rock.

I studied for and passed my GED certification. I took a few night
classes at the local community college. I began to read again,
mostly books lent to me by Dr. Farber--Goncharov's <i>Oblomov</i>
(appropriate for me), Martin Buber's <i>I and Thou</i>, which I still fail
to appreciate, poems by Randall Jarrell and Phillip Larkin. I got a
summer job in the kitchen of a summer camp. "Girl, we've got to
teach you to <i>work</i>," said the cook, and I quit after a few weeks.


I also began to get myself in trouble with alcohol and bad companions.
When night fell we could be found at the Stockbridge Inn,
known to regulars as Simmy's, drinking beer and waiting to be
picked up. Simmy's was full of local characters, pool-players laid off
from their jobs at G.E., reprobates thrown out of their houses by
their wives, glumly stewing at the bar, low-life freeriders on the sexual
revolution, buying us drinks and dragging a <i>carpe diem</i> line.


I became promiscuous, and I confessed my promiscuity to Dr.
Farber. I think I told him about every encounter. His response was
surprisingly muted. Again? he would say. Once he called me a
"female jerk." He got truly angry only when the man in question was
married.


Why did I behave that way? I can think of psychoanalytic explanations:
Perhaps I was "acting out" the unconscious feelings that Dr.
S's seductiveness had aroused in me, or, more likely, punishing
myself for having rejected him and having won Dr. Farber as a protector.
I can think of obvious explanations: I was bored, and getting
picked up was fun.


I tried out my hypotheses on Dr. Farber. His response was to cut
me off. "I'm not interested in that," he would say. His approach, as
always, seemed to steer a slalom course around the causal markers I
had put in place. Instead he turned the discussion to my drinking
and to drinking in general. We talked about the coarsening of feeling,

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I carry that around with me still, and also the "female jerk"
remark. One negative, one positive--both were his gifts of confirmation.


Then I got pregnant, not by one of my Simmy's pickups but as a
result of a brief re-encounter with another patient who had been
my boyfriend for a summer.


I had skipped a period, felt sick in the mornings, but I refused
to acknowledge my condition until one of the nurses, a local
woman with a pungent sense of humor, whacked me on the rear
as I stood serving myself in the Riggs dining room and made a
remark about eating for two. Then I panicked.


A Pittsfield gynecologist confirmed my condition. There are
certain circumstances in which bringing a pregnancy to term may
not be advisable, he told me. Do what you can do on your own,
and call me in two weeks if you haven't had any luck. Perhaps
they can help you at Riggs. I wonder now why I didn't take this as
a veiled and provisional assurance that he would give me an abortion
(then illegal). That was surely what he meant. Instead, I put
emphasis on his instruction to "do what I could."


When Dr. Farber asked me if I wanted my parents told, I said
<i>no</i>. I did tell two of my inpatient friends about the pregnancy,
though, and soon everybody knew. The director barged into Dr.
Farber's office and demanded that my parents be called immediately.
The institution would be liable, he insisted, for anything

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Farber reported to me that the director had suggested a
therapeutic abortion. This would require Dr. Farber's assent and
his signature on a document attesting to my unfitness to bear and
raise a child. Dr. Farber explained his refusal carefully; he could
not arrange the abortion because he could not agree with such a
statement. I nodded, barely listening. He had raised my hopes and
dashed them, but I felt no resentment, no reaction except an
acceleration of panic.


I spent a week on the phone, following leads, being scolded
long-distance by abortion activists for my past failure to get involved
in the issue. Finally I was instructed to dial a New York number, to
wait until the phone was picked up and to give my number and area
code to the silent person at the end of the line, then to wait for a call.
I followed these instructions; the phone rang and a deep, emphysematous
male voice told me to be at the Port Authority bus terminal
at a certain date and time the following week, standing next to the
third phone booth at the Forty-second Street entrance. I was to bring
six hundred dollars in cash.


I got the money from the ex-boyfriend, and the two friends in
whom I had confided drove me to New York. I waited at the designated
place until I was approached by a little man in a green
suede cap, who beckoned me out of the terminal and into the
back of a limousine, where I was soon joined by an engaged couple
from Teaneck, New Jersey. We were all blindfolded and driven
to some place in the Bronx (my friends, I learned later, were

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then it was my turn to follow the little man up the back stairs, to
shake hands solemnly with "Dr. Adams," to lie down on my back on
a linoleum table in a kitchen furnished as sparely as a stage set while
five or six radios blared, all tuned to different stations, a crude wall of
sound. It was over soon, and I was given pads and an envelope full of
antibiotics and allowed to go.


I was delighted to see my friends waiting for me at the end of
the block, waving and jumping. They had spent the time eating a
late lunch at a nearby Chinese restaurant, and they had saved me
an eggroll.


Later that evening I stood dialing Dr. Farber's Stockbridge number,
up to my wobbly ankles in sawdust in the back of a West Village
bar and steakhouse, full of brandy alexanders and Demerol.
Dr. Farber's wife answered and handed the phone immediately to
Dr. Farber. "You're all right?" he said. I heard his wife whisper
"Thank God!" in the background. Years later, when I got to know
her well, she told me that Dr. Farber had spent hours that day in
acute anxiety, pacing back and forth in his study.


I launched into a description of my experience, but he cut me
off. "Tell me later. You really feel all right?" I feel <i>fine</i>, I said, and I
did. I was celebrating my passage through a rite; my friends were
treating me with respect and solicitude; the adventure had ended
safely and I was high as a kite. At the end of the conversation I said
something like "You're really a great guy!" or perhaps "I love you!"
I don't remember.

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Many of the things Dr. Farber said have acted on me much later
with a "time-release" effect. It was many years after his death when I
finally understood his refusal to endorse a therapeutic abortion for
me. At the time I had dismissed it, if I thought about it at all, as adult
boilerplate, the kind of carefully worded refusal every adolescent
recognizes. Now I realized <i>he really meant it</i>. He did not refuse to
sign this statement because of a legalistic moral scrupulousness; he
refused because he believed I was able, even then, to bear and raise
a child.


I'm retrospectively relieved that I had an abortion. I cannot
imagine myself in one of my many chaotic apartments, feeding and
rocking and changing a baby. Apparently Dr. Farber could, though,
and perhaps he was right. But whether or not he was right doesn't
matter; what does is his faith in me, which took me more than
twenty years to appreciate, or perhaps to accept.


Was Dr. Farber acting out of an antiabortion agenda? He was,
after all, a religious man, a private and nonobservant but passionate
believer. Was his refusal to endorse a therapeutic abortion an attempt
to influence me? No. He was an anti-ideologue and no manipulator.
He took the crisis of my pregnancy far more seriously than I did; he
understood it as a true dilemma, and he showed a respect for me that
I perhaps did not deserve by allowing it to be mine.


Have I found myself, now that I am older and the mother of a living
child, capable of guilt about that abortion? Not really. I find I
can't advance very far along the path of speculation about alternative
fates for that dead fetus without backing up in confusion. The
voice of the conceptus is too faint, too garbled and muted by the distance
of time and the crosscutting static of possibility for me to hear
it clearly. He is no more apparent to me than Dr. Farber's God.

I am just as needy now as I was then. But perhaps by now I've
also become the serious friend--the person capable of despair--
of whom Dr. Farber wrote. This is the question that continues to
haunt me: What would Dr. Farber make of me now? How would
he judge the person I've become?
