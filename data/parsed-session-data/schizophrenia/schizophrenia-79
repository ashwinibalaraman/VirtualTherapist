BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> And thank you very much for -
<b>PT:</b> You're welcome.
<b>DR:</b> Um, agreeing to do that.  So you mentioned being under stress, but also that you've been able to get through it.  How have you been managing with that?
<b>PT:</b> Well -
<b>DR:</b> What kinds of, uh, supports are helpful when it comes to getting through stressful times?
<b>PT:</b> The support of family and friends.
<b>DR:</b> That's excellent.  I liked your card by the way.
<b>PT:</b> Oh -
<b>DR:</b> Your holiday card, that was wonderful.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, thank you.
<b>DR:</b> With the little house on it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's so nice.  How did the holidays go?
<b>PT:</b> Pretty, pretty good.  I got a little sick on Christmas Eve.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Got paranoid and everything.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But, uh, I got, you know, I got over it.
<b>DR:</b> What was the situation?  Was it was when you were with a group of people, or in church?
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, it was with my family.  But there's, my brother's in-laws, this certain family, they're real loud and, and I don't particularly like them.  And I try to be nice to them, and I just felt like they don't like me, and, I don't know, just, it just gets me paranoid when I'm around them.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes it seems kind of overwhelming with all the noise, and so many people laughing, and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> A lot going on.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But, uh -
<b>DR:</b> How did you cope with that that evening, did you end up going to a different room, or talking with someone who [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> Well, we left.  And then I just went home and took my medicine and went to bed.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  Okay.  Sometimes knowing when, okay, I've had enough socializing for one night.  That's a good way to go.  And I also sense as though you didn't let them ruin the evening for you, it's just you were, might of stayed a little longer if they weren't there, but it, it made a good, this was a good time to, to get some distance and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Be able to go home and get some rest.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You did it, good job.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I had a nice time up until the end.  It just seems like that happens with me.  When I'm saying good-bye to people I get paranoid.  I think they're saying go home, you, you know, you, we don't like you, goo, goo, good riddance.  I get all these negative ideas in my head.
<b>DR:</b> And you're such a likable person.  I don't think you're seeing what other people do.  But sometimes I think it might be hard to, you know, to distinguish.  Sometimes you're telling yourself to go home because you're ready, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And it's not that, that you don't like you, it's just, I'm not liking this situation anymore, I'm ready to go.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So it's probably really how you're feeling, but, you know, it's got to be hard to, when you're tired at the end of a long day, and a night of socializing, and so many people talking, and so many things going on, I bet it's hard to, to remember, I'm actually going because I really want to go.  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know?
<b>PT:</b> I bounced back, and I went, went down my sister's on Christmas Day, down the shore, and we had a real nice time.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's wonderful.  Whereabouts?  Where do you go?
<b>PT:</b> She has a place in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> That's a beautiful town.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And I like it at the holidays.  It's peaceful.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The ocean is still beautiful.
<b>PT:</b> It was neat.  Me and my boyfriend, we walked on the boardwalk, and another couple came by and they said Merry Christmas, and it was just -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's nice.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was cute.
<b>DR:</b> And you've been dating him for a little while now.
<b>PT:</b> I got engaged, did I tell you?
<b>DR:</b> I was wondering about that beautiful ring.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Congratulations.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he, on [DATE] he -
<b>DR:</b> That's fantastic.
<b>PT:</b> He took me to this jewelry store, and I, you know, didn't know why we were going or anything -
<b>DR:</b> Wow.  I like a man who asks a woman for her opinion.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I like what you chose, it's beautiful.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Some nights it's really sparkly.
<b>DR:</b> You know what's a good trick for that is, um, a little bit of toothpaste and toothbrush.  It's amazing how that'll shine up a diamond.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Just a little tiny bit abrasive, and it gets, you know, you have like, um, little, uh, spaces in the ring where the light glints through it, it get that in there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Wow, that's fantastic.  Have you two picked a date yet?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Because, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> See, I was married in a Catholic church, and we have to get an annulment, uh, before I can get married in the Catholic church again.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So that might take a year, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  But you know what steps to take.
<b>PT:</b> But we're not in any hurry.
<b>DR:</b> That's, yeah.  You don't have to be in a hurry.  It sounds like you're enjoying each others company.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You've got a lifelong commitment, and -
<b>PT:</b> He's very good to me.
<b>DR:</b> That's wonderful.  How did you two meet?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, over at [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> I, I, um, went after him, actually.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's great.
<b>PT:</b> And -
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes you just have a hunch.
<b>PT:</b> And I said, you know, "Maybe we can go out for coffee."  And then -
<b>DR:</b> Wonderful.
<b>PT:</b> It took a few months, but then it happened.
<b>DR:</b> That's really exciting.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And your hunch was right.  I mean, it sounds like -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> He was looking for a committed relationship also.  Wow.
<b>PT:</b> I don't think he knew it in the beginning.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But clearly it got through.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we've been going together almost four years now.
<b>DR:</b> That's so exciting.  How does he get along with your son?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, they don't have too much contact, but it's congenial.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> I think it's better that we're not getting married right away, because I want [NAME OTHER] to be a little bit older, and, you know, more on his way.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Because he's got some transitions coming up.  He's probably looking at high school in a couple years, right?
<b>PT:</b> College.  He's a [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> He's a [DEIDENTIFIED] in high school already?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> This is what happened.  I think you and I have worked together for about 10 years.  I can't believe it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> That's why I'm under so much stress, because he's, like, he won't go to school in the morning, and I'm hollering for him.  You know, every morning is a big struggle.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.  Whoa, he's not a morning person, is he?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I tell him if he goes to college he better take late classes.
<b>DR:</b> Well, he could.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> At least he would be able to choose that way.  But, you're right, I mean, the high school there, they have their hours and that's it.  Wow.  Well, it, does it look like he's going to be able to graduate?
<b>PT:</b> Hopefully.
<b>DR:</b> He's okay?  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He had mono, uh, in September; he was out for three weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, poor kid.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.  So it has been a stressful end of 2008 for you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, 2009 I think is getting off to a good start.  Does he have a way to make up the work that he missed when he was ill?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, yeah, he didn't really make it up, they kind of let him slide.
<b>DR:</b> From what I understand, he's pretty smart.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So I bet he kept up, you know, in terms of understanding the classes and all.  But, yeah, I mean I think you will feel more like you can kind of take a deep breath, and it'll feel like he's more on his way -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know, to his adult career once he's in college.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Like, if he doesn't go to college that's, like, on him.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But for me, I have to get him through high school, you know, because that's, like, the minimum.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Of course you want to do every, okay, this is [PHYSICIAN NAME], resuming conversation on [DATE] with [PATIENT NAME].  Um, thank you very much for bearing with me while I changed the batteries.  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> No problem.
<b>DR:</b> I'll toss those away.  It really sounds as though you've got him, you know, in a position for success, you know, as much as you can help him get to school in the morning, and he got through the bout with mono, and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know, I see what you're saying, just a few more months, you know.  Does he have summer plans yet?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He probably is going down the shore, like, senior week.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know.  But he doesn't have a, he quit his job about a month ago, so he has to find another job.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  What was he doing?
<b>PT:</b> Dishwashing.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b> And he wanted to be busboy, and he was supposed to move up, but they never did, and I guess he got discouraged, and he was getting sick and everything.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, exactly.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know, it might have been not good for him, you know, around all those germs on the dinnerware and stuff, you know, that he was washing.
<b>DR:</b> It could well be.  And I have a feeling that if he's looking in the summer, there's a lot of summer work available, you know, Jersey shore and the resorts, and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's true.
<b>DR:</b> And that kind of thing.  So if, if he was kind of feeling like he was at a dead end at the other place, it's probably a good thing he took a stand.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And they can't take the experience away from him.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And he can also say, you know, "I was ready to move up to busboy; they weren't making good on it.  I got ill."  There's nothing that reflects badly on him about that at all.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So.  Well, it sounds like you're on the right track in so many ways.  How's you medications supply holding up?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, about that -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I ran out of Geodon.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And she told me I shouldn't have ran out.
<b>DR:</b> I'll -
<b>PT:</b> And, um, Geodon I ran out of.  And when I went to the pharmacy -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> A couple weeks ago, they said that they didn't have a new order for clozapine.  So they -
<b>DR:</b> That certainly shouldn't be the case either.
<b>PT:</b> And then when I went for trazadone last week, they said they didn't have an order for that.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  I'm going to update everything.  Because the last time I did it, I did it with, um, multiple refills on each.  But this being '09, maybe it just makes sense to go ahead and send them a whole fresh sheet.  I'm going to send some information over to, uh, to the [DEIDENTIFIED] today.  So let me be sure that I get everything, uh, ordered properly, and also I'll get you whatever samples I have.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I know you're taking the Geodon, 60 mg, twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  And you take that with food.  Okay.  And your blood counts are fantastic, so no problem there with the clozapine.  And the clozapine is currently the 300 mg at 8:00 PM, right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Perfect.  And Synthroid is still 100 mcg.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> The trazodone is still 50 mg at bedtime.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Um, the Seroquel -
<b>PT:</b> Twenty five at bedtime.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you've really tapered way back on that.  That's great.  Um, the lithium is 300 mg, 1 in the morning, and 2 at bedtime.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Um, and the Effexor XR, that is, that's a total of 225?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Very good.  And you could use samples of Effexor, Seroquel and Geodon, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, sounds good.  I think the Effexor has gone generic, too, and hopefully the price should be coming down pretty soon as well.  So let me see what I can find in terms of the samples.
<b>PT:</b> Seroquel I might have enough at home.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I have, like, 100 mg, and then I cut them up into 4.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That you're able to do that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Because I know those aren't especially large pills, so that's great that you can do that.  And I'll take a look at my supply over here.  That is so exciting, engaged.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Very romantic.  All right.  Let's see, Effexor.  I'm going to see if there's a few things for you.  [INAUDIBLE] 75s.  Maybe I'll look in here.  I'd like to maybe look in here, because this drawer was stuck.  There it [INAUDIBLE].  And Geodon 60 like before.  Did you ever hear of that old radio show Fibber McGee and Molly?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> They would always have these sound effects.  Uh, they would say, "Don't go in my closet, there are too many things in that closet."  They would open the closet and everything would come falling out.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  It sounds like my closet.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, it sounds like all of my closets, too.
<b>PT:</b> I have boxes up in my bedroom closet, and they always come flying down at me.
<b>DR:</b> There needs to be a better system.  You figure with [INAUDIBLE] or something.  Okay.  Yes, I knew I had some Geodon 60 in here.  Let's see what I've got.  So you take 40s and 20s as well?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Or not.  Yeah, you can always combine them.  Okay, good.  Found some Seroquel 25s.
<b>PT:</b> And I was supposed to see you next Thursday.  Should I tell them to cancel it?
<b>DR:</b> Um, let me think.  We probably could, but if you'd like to, you know, keep it, that would be okay with me.  Is this Seroquel?  Okay, oh, good, good.  I've got more Seroquel, this is great.  I've got 50s, so that's a little bit easier for you to cut in half.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Great.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Will I have enough Geodon?
<b>DR:</b> What's that?
<b>PT:</b> Will there be enough Geodon?
<b>DR:</b> I'm going to make sure that we get enough.  And that way you can have the flexibility about whether you want to keep that appointment.  Okay.  I'm going to look in one more drawer, too.  I think I've got more.  [INAUDIBLE].  Okay.  I'll get you a bag for everything, too.  Uh, yes, I have more Effexor for you also.  They stopped sampling, so I made sure that I put a whole bunch aside, so this is great.  Okay.  Oops.  Okay.  So I'm going to get a bag and go back to the sample closet for Geodon, and you'll be in good shape.  Let me go ahead and shut this just since, uh, we're leaving the room.  Thank you so much.
<b>PT:</b> You're welcome, doc.
