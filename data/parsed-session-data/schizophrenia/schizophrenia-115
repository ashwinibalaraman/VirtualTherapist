My brother bought me a whole, whole bunch of tea I said I needed, they didn't charge me for that, like it was, uh, not, $8.15 for a box of Lipton Tea.  [NAME OTHER], my brother's wife got it for about $2.50 at Costco.  So she got me a lot of tea.  Tomorrow I go over there and paint a wall, paint it the second coat of a wall my, my brother's house because —
<b>DR:</b> What about food [PATIENT NAME]?  You look like you're still losing weight.
<b>PT:</b> Well, maybe I am.  I don't know.  The cigarettes, cigarettes and coffee.
<b>DR:</b> Why don't you go weight yourself?  Let's see what you weigh.
<b>PT:</b> [COUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Cigarettes, coffee, and tea, that doesn't give you much weight here.  Well, look at that.

<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> She was married and had two, two kids, right?
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.  Yeah, I got to help my brother out.  He's been taking care of me since dad died.  He's been doing my taxes.  I'm helping them out by fixing up his house.  Worse thing about it was that, um, he, he redid his kitchen, his small kitchen, you know my brother's house is [INAUDIBLE] ants over there.  After all the work of a new countertop in this kitchen, goddamn ants hanging over there.  He's got two dogs, two cats, two children, has a mortgage.  He's overweight like you —
<b>DR:</b> What's your, uh, height?
<b>PT:</b> 6'1".  And he's, uh, my other brother's is going to the mainland [PHYSICIAN NAME] in the second week of August, [NAME OTHER], the farmer on the big island.  He's going to the big island.  I'll never see him again.  Called him up and said, "When you leaving?"  He quit his job, his, [NAME OTHER] gave my brother, uh, I was in the Air Force with —
<b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.
<b>PT:</b> He's going to the mainland forever.  I won't see him again, in, never in my life.
<b>DR:</b> Why?  The mainland is not, you could go to the mainland.
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't have the money —
<b>DR:</b> How often did you go visit him on the big island?  You hardly ever visited him.
<b>PT:</b> I was there for his wedding.
<b>DR:</b> And how long ago was that?
<b>PT:</b> I don't have time for a visit.  I don't have the money or the time.  I can't afford to visit.  Besides, when I was in the Merchant Marine, I got my fill of the outer islands.  I saw [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'm not going to travel again.  I don't like traveling.  I like comic books.
<b>DR:</b> Comic books.
<b>PT:</b> You know, uh, [NAME OTHER], my Chinese manager who got promoted?  He's a traveller.  He went to China to visit his, uh, relatives in there.  Care for mother, so he's not at the club anymore.
<b>DR:</b> So what did you do for the [DATE], [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Read a book, stayed indoors, watched the fireworks from my window.  Yeah, my apartment is like, you know, that English novel "A Room with a View."
<b>DR:</b> Oh, good.
<b>PT:</b> So, when I'm not reading —
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> I look out the window.  I don't watch TV anymore.
<b>DR:</b> What do you have a view of?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, downtown.
<b>DR:</b> So you saw the [DEIDENTIFIED] fireworks?
<b>PT:</b> I saw some fireworks.  They had one firework that it was like a, a red light that slowly drifted down.  Something like out of "The War of the Worlds'.  So it was a good fire, fire, uh, firework thing.  I read a book.  I've been reading books all this time.  I can't have that Time magazine, can I?
<b>DR:</b> Which one?
<b>PT:</b> Outside.
<b>DR:</b> I have to look at the date.  If it's old, yeah —
<b>PT:</b> It's not old.
<b>DR:</b> If it's brand new, no —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't watch TV —
<b>DR:</b> But I can save it for you.  When it gets old, you can have it.
<b>PT:</b> I do a lot of reading [PHYSICIAN NAME].  I'm trying to get smart.  You know, trying to educate myself.
<b>DR:</b> Well, [PATIENT NAME] look, you have very few friends; you're not dating, what about picking up your social life here?
<b>PT:</b> You mean instead of becoming a recluse like Howard Hughes?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I got to figure out, my friend [NAME OTHER], that's smart?  I hate this guy.  [NAME OTHER], Filipino guy.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Well, that, that guy is smart as a tack, man.  He's smarter than I am.  That's why I hate him.  He's married, came to the club, worked, does a real good job.  He seconds as a, as a janitor and busboy —
<b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.
<b>PT:</b> While, I'm mopping, setting the tables, he's doing the other work.  This Filipino saved my ass from all the drugs that I, that used to be in the club.  They came in, this is, this is a period of two and a half years I think since I've been working, they work hard, they're enthusiastic, their friendly, they take care of their own, they're easy going.  So I'm still, still hanging in there.  I —
<b>DR:</b> So any of them have any sisters for you?
<b>PT:</b> No.  [DATE] —
<b>DR:</b> What do you mean no?  Did you ask?
<b>PT:</b> No.  [DATE] coming up will be 25 years with the Army, 25 freaking years working that damn job, $4.13 an hour to $12.44.  You're not prejudice, are you?  You're not prejudice against other races, are you?
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> Against Blacks, Mexicans, or anything —
<b>DR:</b> No, no —
<b>PT:</b> No —
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> No other class, no other class of, uh, race?
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> Not prejudice against?
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not prejudice either, but, you know, this thought keeps occurring to me in my life, you know my thought, you know [NAME OTHER]?  He's had a purpose filled life.  That's one I want to have.  I want, I want to be an achievement, you know, do achievements.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I suggested taking that course, [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> I read it last night, most of my credits are in political science and history, the, uh, economics professor is an oriental person, [NAME OTHER].  I know [NAME OTHER], who is a political science teacher.  He's a tall, skinny guy like me.  He's from Israel, and, uh, another woman professor, a new woman professor of political science.
<b>DR:</b> Well, nowadays the economy is the big problem.  You could —
<b>PT:</b> That's —
<b>DR:</b> Actually, uh —
<b>PT:</b> Economics is too —
<b>DR:</b> You could get a lot out of an —
<b>PT:</b> Eco, eco —
<b>DR:</b> Economy, uh, course.
<b>PT:</b> Economics is too hard.  I can't handle that.  I don't have the brains for that.  I thought I had the brains for scientific endeavors, you know, scientific reading —
<b>DR:</b> But —
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] —
<b>DR:</b> But you, you have the brains for political science, right?
<b>PT:</b> Hm, I don't have that much brains.  If I was smart, if I was smart as [NAME OTHER], I possibly, uh, be tempted, the medication is good, there us no problem —
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] look, you wrote the, you wrote the papers.  All your dad did was type them.  I mean you're, you're smart.
<b>PT:</b> I'm a reader, that's what I am.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you read —
<b>PT:</b> I'm a voracious reader.
<b>DR:</b> That's right, that's great.
<b>PT:</b> You know, in fact I was reading the newspaper right before I came here.  I read the newspaper, books my brother gave me, magazines, that's all I do now, is just read damn things, trying to get smart, you know, trying to improve my life.
<b>DR:</b> Do you —
<b>PT:</b> I don't go to Starbucks, uh,  Sam Goody, I bought those movies, DVDs, and I don't go the [DEIDENTIFIED] on [DEIDENTIFIED], I cleaned them out of their half priced comics.  I don't go there anymore.  I don't go to [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED], that comic store, which is overpriced, and I don't go to [DEIDENTIFIED], the one on [DEIDENTIFIED], that's overpriced.
<b>DR:</b> All right, but since your dad passed away, and your mom passed away, you know, you've been pretty lonely, you know, you've been —
<b>PT:</b> Uh —
<b>DR:</b> Calling here every, almost every day, right?  And —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah —
<b>DR:</b> I'm thinking, you know, it's time for you to make some friends, you know, it's, uh —
<b>PT:</b> Even [NAME OTHER] won't talk to me.  I call him up all the time.  He's just like me.  He's by himself.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you need to make friends who want to talk to you, want to, you know spend time with you.
<b>PT:</b> I have this nagging suspicion I'm going to get popped again at the club, you know, get into a fight with somebody else.  I'm nervous.  Every time I go to the club —
<b>DR:</b> You're not using drugs anymore, why would you get popped?
<b>PT:</b> Uh —
<b>DR:</b> Come on.
<b>PT:</b> Get into two fistfights with my brother and the Puerto Rican guy, that's, that's one of the reasons why I smoke.
<b>DR:</b> Do you ever go to those smoking classes?
<b>PT:</b> That's why I called up.  I wanted the Wellbutrin.  I only got one bottle.
<b>DR:</b> I don't have any samples, I could write you a prescription.
<b>PT:</b> And I have to pay for it?
<b>DR:</b> It's covered by your insurance, [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> Huh?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Would I have to pay for it, that's what I'm asking.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, it's covered by your insurance.
<b>PT:</b> But if I go to the store, I'm going to have to pay them, right?
<b>DR:</b> Maybe 10 bucks, 5 bucks, uh —
<b>PT:</b> For how many bottles?
<b>DR:</b> A whole month's worth.
<b>PT:</b> Well maybe I'll do that, write me a prescription, and I —
<b>DR:</b> Well, uh, what about the talk show?
<b>PT:</b> What about talk show?
<b>DR:</b> Do you ever feel, still got that feeling?
<b>PT:</b> I hear, I heard the word game on the radio a lot, but that's music.
<b>DR:</b> So no more, no more of that stuff?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So are you getting along at work?  I mean, are you getting, I know you, I mean you might get in trouble if you start getting mouthy.
<b>PT:</b> Agitated?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> No, I made the decision, like last night, my two co—workers, [NAME OTHER], the tall Mexican guy who's a retired Air Force, yeah he has five children.  He's a talk tall Mexican guy, he's an old man, and this Filipino guy named [NAME OTHER], who, who got a DUI.  He's younger than I am.  I was there, I told my brother last night about this, I was there, those fucking guys were bitching like mad, "You know what, I'll fucking do this, for goddamn, how come nobody else is," they started bitching I just walked away from them, because I'm under the impression that, by myself, if I want to go to the comic store, or if I want to buy milk, I'm going to have to work now.  I don't have mommy and daddy behind me now.
<b>DR:</b> You taking your Zyprexa?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Every night, you swear?
<b>PT:</b> Every, every morning.
<b>DR:</b> Every morning, you swear?
<b>PT:</b> It's, it's time I need some more, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You swear now?
<b>PT:</b> I swear, I swear, on my god's honor.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I stay on my medication, so please —
<b>DR:</b> Why do you take it in the morning?  It's, it's good, it's good —
<b>PT:</b> I take my —
<b>DR:</b> Better at night.
<b>PT:</b> I take my cholesterol pill at night.  I have two medications —
<b>DR:</b> Well, you should take it at night.  It'll help you sleep.
<b>PT:</b> I don't have any problem sleeping.
<b>DR:</b> Does this, it doesn't make you sleepy during the day?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You're sure?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> So my, you know, [PHYSICIAN NAME], if I were you, being overweight as you are, I don't mean to embarrass you, or insult you, but the only thing I would say to you would be start walking.  One of the reasons I'm so skinny and lean is because I exercise at the club.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you've lost a lot of weight since your parents passed away, and I don't like it because it means you're not eating.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm not eating the right foods.  I get the crap from the Army, that's about it, plus I don't go out to eat.  I've been living on tea, milk, coffee, and cigarettes.  Write me that prescription for Wellbutrin.  I could use it.  And, [PHYSICIAN NAME] another thing, you know, uh, I, I would like to finish my comic collection before I start school, if that's possible.  What do you think about that?
<b>DR:</b> Fine.
<b>PT:</b> I've been, I have, uh, I bought another box, $12.95, which was, which was a rip—off, and I still go to [DEIDENTIFIED].  That's they only store that I'm going to be going to from now on.  Because the other [DEIDENTIFIED], I cleaned them out, half priced comics, got some good issues.  It's right close, it's right close down the street from where you are, and it's a lifesaver, man.  It's a freaking lifesaver.  If I didn't do comics, I'd be in dire straights.  I wouldn't have nothing to do with myself, probably would've continued drug use, or alcoholism.  There is, uh, my next—door neighbor is this Japanese guy, got laid off, he drinks.  I find, I'll find his wine bottles in the, uh, refuse place.  So I'm enjoying my life.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So remember, how much do you smoke, now?
<b>PT:</b> A pack a day.
<b>DR:</b> You know, try to cut back to a half a pack a day while you're taking one pill of the Wellbutrin in the morning.  When you get to a half a pack a day, and you've been taking one pill of Wellbutrin, then go cold turkey.  At the same exact time you to cold turkey, take two pills of Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b> So one while you smoke, two when you stop.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> All right, I got it.
<b>DR:</b> But you have to stop, [PATIENT NAME], you can't just keep on taking, the, uh, the medicine and smoking.
<b>PT:</b> One when you smoke, two when you stop, right?
<b>DR:</b> But you have to go from one whole pack to half pack —
<b>PT:</b> One when you stop —
<b>DR:</b> It's easy to stop —
<b>PT:</b> One —
<b>DR:</b> It's easy to stop when you're smoking less.
<b>PT:</b> I have the gum, and I have one bottle of Wellbutrin, and the last bottle that you gave me substitute for, uh —
<b>DR:</b> You shouldn't take more than a few, you know, maybe a two weeks to get to a half pack.  Just go, you know what I said, tell people is cut their, their pack in half.  Just cut it in half, you know, just cut the cigarettes in half —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then smoke the half, the, the filtered part.
<b>PT:</b> I'm blowing my money on cigarettes.
<b>DR:</b> You're blowing your money on cigarettes.  That's right, you are.
<b>PT:</b> One when you, one when you puff, two when you stop, right.
<b>DR:</b> Right, but you have to go from a whole pack to a half pack when you stop.
<b>PT:</b> If I buy this, they're going to give me directions, right?
<b>DR:</b> It's a, it's just what I told you.
<b>PT:</b> One, one when you puff, then two when you stop.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> You know I still have the, uh, the last piece of paper that you gave me for Wellbutrin, too, is that still valid?
<b>DR:</b> I don't know that was a long time ago.  Use this one.
<b>PT:</b> So medication is good, reading books that I should've read in high school.  I'm trying to turn into my father.  That's all my father did, all he did was read, do crosswords, and drink scotch at night.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but he was a smoker when he was younger, right?
<b>PT:</b> He stopped he never did that.
<b>DR:</b> Well, look at what it did to him when he was older.  It killed him.
<b>PT:</b> Pulmonary fibrosis —
<b>DR:</b> That's right.
<b>PT:</b> Abscess, and stroke.
<b>DR:</b> That's right, so I'm telling you, [PATIENT NAME], you got to stop smoking.
<b>PT:</b> You know, uh, I have to say that my life is going like, maybe 85% well, and 50% bad since my parents died.
<b>DR:</b> Well, the one area that is really lacking is your socialization.
<b>PT:</b> Well, whatever, it doesn't matter to me.
<b>DR:</b> Well —
<b>PT:</b> I'm a busy person, I collect comics books —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but —
<b>PT:</b> As a hobby.
<b>DR:</b> You know you call here every day because you're lonely, and I, I, you know, I think if you had a friend, you know, you wouldn't be lonely.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not lonely, [PHYSICIAN NAME], I need advice.  You got to figure it out, what I want to do with my life.  I'm getting old, man.  I'm [AGE] this year.  You know I'm thinking finish my comics up, even though, what do you call that word where it's over and done with, finito?  You get reprints for free over there, you know that?  Reprints are cheap.  They're $2.00 a piece.  I bought Kirby the last three times I was there.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> Jack Kirby, he's dead now.  He's my favorite artist.  Reprint comics, you know, the originals, the originals are about 10-12 bucks a piece, but reprints are $2.00, they're cheap.  So the last three visits that I went over there I got 25, 27, 81 comics, three times in a row, 25, 27, 27 comics for about 40 bucks a piece.
<b>DR:</b> Do they look like the real thing?
<b>PT:</b> They're in good, they're good condition, but I already got them.  I order from [DEIDENTIFIED] and that, the, uh, there are issues in the box; I have a lot of comic books now.  So school is going to cost money, if I attempt to go.  It's a remote possibility.  You should, you don't think I should change my major, do you?  I mean —
<b>DR:</b> It would be nice if you took something different.
<b>PT:</b> Anthropology —
<b>DR:</b> That would be fun.
<b>PT:</b> Sociology, psychology, political science, economics, those are the social sciences in my field group.  Sociology, psychology, economics, political science, and the other one.
<b>DR:</b> Well, why don't you take something different?  Take, uh, sociology —
<b>PT:</b> There is, I need 17, you know I dropped out right before I had to declare a major, back in '96.  Seventeen classes to go in Political Science, for a Political Science degree.  I dropped out right before I had to declare a major.  So I have the, uh, catalog.  I can peruse the, uh, names and dates, but you're talking a lot of money for school, man.  Five hundred bucks a, a class.
<b>DR:</b> That's nothing compared to how much you spend on cigarettes —
<b>PT:</b> And they're —
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] —
<b>PT:</b> And they're moving to [DEIDENTIFIED], man.
<b>DR:</b> Is that right?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] has got a new compass in [DEIDENTIFIED], you think I want to drive all the way out to [DEIDENTIFIED] to go to school?  I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> So go to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> What happened to your cheeks, man, look they're all red.  Both of your cheeks by your eyes are red.  You know when I was younger, and I was in the Air Force, and when I was a young person, I had sex.  You know the worst thing, I think I, uh, did in my life, as far as, uh, things that go in my life was to, uh, get out of the Air Force early.  I got an honorable, I got an honorable discharge, fully qualified when I was young, just because of that girl I knew, [NAME OTHER], she wrote me a Dear John letter back when I was [AGE].  I was in love.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I shouldn't have got out.  I could've painted curbs and got my stripes.  So the sergeant, [NAME OTHER], is going to Colorado, man.  So I called him up, he's the one that punched me in the nose, I called him up and I said, "Come over to my apartment, man, and grab some videos before you go."  I'll give him those books that I read.  There is nothing else I can give him.  I don't have that many possessions.  You know, my brother, [NAME OTHER], he's the one who works for the paper.  He did rather well in his life.  He has a family, a house, good profession.  So it's like two males against three females.  They're the only family that I have, now.  So I'm trying to equal the balance.  You get two children, and plus they're boys, that's real good.  I like boys, man, they're, they're smart.  Who else has children?  Somebody else has children.  You know you has a son?  Uh, who knows?  I don't see the old [DEIDENTIFIED] people anymore.  I don't call them up, [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER].  I called [NAME OTHER] one day, he didn't want to talk to me.  He's a, uh, friend of my father.  So I'm out of [DEIDENTIFIED] for good, I'm out of [DEIDENTIFIED] for good.
<b>DR:</b> What you call them up for?
<b>PT:</b> I wanted to talk to him.  I was lonely, man.
<b>DR:</b> Ah, uh, you just, you just said —
<b>PT:</b> He's a nice guy.  I grew up with him.  He used to play —
<b>DR:</b> You're lonely.
<b>PT:</b> The old, uh, banjo at the parties, and the dead end street in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I —
<b>DR:</b> Well, how about, how about you, you know, go into NA?
<b>PT:</b> What's that, Narcotics Anonymous?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't take narcotics anymore.
<b>DR:</b> I know, that's for people who don't take it anymore, and they get together, and they become friends.  They could, they could become your friends.
<b>PT:</b> I don't need that.  I'm not taking narcotics.
<b>DR:</b> No, but you used to, and these, these people don't either.  They're, that's they're goal in life, is to —
<b>PT:</b> No, no —
<b>DR:</b> Stay clean and sober.
<b>PT:</b> I'm never, I'm not an alcoholic, I'm not a narcotics user anymore.  I don't do that.  I drink coffee —
<b>DR:</b> No, but you need —
<b>PT:</b> I smoke.
<b>DR:</b> But you need friends.
<b>PT:</b> You know I think, for example, when I put my tip money in the bank before I came here, there was a beautiful Filipino chick talking to me.  I mean this chick, she was small, she's a small girl, but she's was at a bank.  But she's good looking.  No, I don't take, I don't take drugs no more.
<b>DR:</b> So what happened?
<b>PT:</b> Put my money in the bank and left.
<b>DR:</b> You didn't talk with her?
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't see her that often.  She's a beautiful Filipino, real nice, real good looking.
<b>DR:</b> So why don't you ask for her number or something?
<b>PT:</b> Takes time, takes time and effort like my comics.  It takes time, effort, and money to do that.  You know, when that girl [NAME OTHER] was here, I spent two weeks with her, took time off from the Army, and my car was in good condition back then.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but that's what you have now, [PATIENT NAME], you have plenty of time, and it would be nice if you made some friends.
<b>PT:</b> You know [PHYSICIAN NAME], I'm weary of, uh, getting, getting together with a woman because I, you know, I hate to say this, but I got a Dear John when I was in the Air Force, came home, and the girl that I was planning to marry, had gotten married to somebody else.  And, uh, I, I'm not to say that I, I don't mean to this, but, you know, a broken heart is a broken heart, but that's for, that kind of reasoning is for idiots.  You know, if you're, if you're lonely because of a broken heart, you'll never get it together with anyone else.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I know, but how long ago was that, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, 22 years ago.
<b>DR:</b> So you still haven't got over it yet?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I don't believe in love and all that crap.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, [PATIENT NAME] you need to get some friends.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I have friends at the club.  Not close friends.
<b>DR:</b> I know, you need somebody you can talk to —
<b>PT:</b> I got you.
<b>DR:</b> Can hang out with go to a movie —
<b>PT:</b> I come to you, I come to you, talk to you, man.
<b>DR:</b> But you can't call me every night, [PATIENT NAME], you got to, you got to —
<b>PT:</b> What are your hours over here, 9:00 to 10:00?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So why did you increase your hours?
<b>DR:</b> I'm here doing all the paperwork.
<b>PT:</b> What about her outside?
<b>DR:</b> Oh, she's gone by 6:00.  You need to make some friends.
<b>PT:</b> You know, [PHYSICIAN NAME] I get the weirdest feeling that, if I don't shape up, stop smoking, start working, I don't work, right?  If I don't stop smoking, if I don't take care of my car, if I don't clean my apartment, I don't want to be like the guys you see up the street when you're driving home.  You know, uh, where I live, [DEIDENTIFIED], when I go over there at night to buy cigarettes, prostitutes, homeless at the apartment complex that I live at, I'm not saying they're, they, they hang around the halls, but you see them on the street.  [COUGHING].  White people with heavy beards, long, matted hair, sleeping on bench corners.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] as long as you come here, take your medicine, you know, stick with your brother, you know, [NAME OTHER], that, that won't happen to you.  I'm saying your life can be improved, even better than it is now if you had, if you had some friends, and I think at Narcotics Anonymous, you know —
<b>PT:</b> Ah —
<b>DR:</b> It's like a brotherhood.  They'll accept you, and you, you have some good friends.  You could tell them, "Hey, I haven't used that stuff in many, many years," and they'll say —
<b>PT:</b> Twenty years, man.
<b>DR:</b> Twenty years, and they'll accept you —
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no —
<b>DR:</b> Like a brother.
<b>PT:</b> I don't need that, man, I don't take drugs anymore, I, it's a long time ago —
<b>DR:</b> I'm just talking that to make friends, [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> One thing about it is I don't get depressed, you know?
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I don't get depressed.  I get nervous, that's the reason I smoke.  Well, one of the reasons I smoke is because I like cigarettes still, and I like to drink a lot of coffee, I like to drink a lot of tea, and I like to drink a lot of soda.  I like caffeine, it's got me wired.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and that's —
<b>PT:</b> That's probably why I'm not eating that much because I'm still, still wired.
<b>DR:</b> I know.  It's no good.
<b>PT:</b> You know, my brother [NAME OTHER] smokes, and my brother [NAME OTHER] still smokes.
<b>DR:</b> How about you going, and walking, and, you know, meeting some, you know, other people?
<b>PT:</b> The most you can do at that apartment complex is to say, is to have a small con, a small quip with somebody riding in the elevator.  I figure I'm good enough looking, get a job, no mental problems, right, where I would pick and choose.  I'm not saying, I'm not saying bad things, but there's some good looking chicks at the apartment complex.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> But you have to admit that people are busy with their own lives.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> They have jobs, school, right?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but there's a lot of lonely people out there, [PATIENT NAME], if you just, happy as heck to, to make your acquaintance.
<b>PT:</b> Is that right?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, all right.  Let me get you your —
<b>PT:</b> It's a time, it's a time, uh, constriction.  You have to work.  You have to read.  You have to go to school.  You have to eat.  You have to watch, I don't watch TV anymore, so screw that, man.  I'm sick of watching TV.  Do you still watch TV?
<b>DR:</b> Very little.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, man, what a waste of life that was.  Do you remember the Mike Douglas show?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, a long time ago.
<b>PT:</b> That's all my father did was read.  It's a lot more enjoyable.  I read three books, the latest one, before my brother leaves, Orson Wells, 630 pages.  What a waste of life that was, watching TV all the time.  My father alive, no wonder he got sick.  You know I have a big TV.  It's about the size of that, a little bit larger.  Big, big, uh, wooden case it's in, I'm not going to sit in home after I work, and watch that stupid thing.  Even the news, my parents died, I need to operate.  I have to operate if I'm going to have anything, a healthy and fulfilled life.
<b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.
<b>PT:</b> You know what I mean?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Staying in that apartment, smoking, and reading, reading the newspaper, books, I guess you're right.  I need a social life.  But it's hard, it's a hard road to take, man.  You want to talk to people, complete strangers?  I'm not the only one.  There's lonely, how many people in my apartment complex like myself —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well —
<b>PT:</b> So —
<b>DR:</b> But it you meet them, then I'm sure they'd be happy.
<b>PT:</b> You know that homosexual friend of mine, he's dead.  He drank himself to death.  My brother's friend, [NAME OTHER], a Puerto Rican guy, his son committed suicide over a woman.  The guy that hit me in the nose —
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> He cracked his head on a windshield, he lost a tooth in another fight.  I think he's dead, I don't know —
<b>DR:</b> All right, [PATIENT NAME], let's get you your medicine, huh?
<b>PT:</b> A lot of it, a lot of those pills.
