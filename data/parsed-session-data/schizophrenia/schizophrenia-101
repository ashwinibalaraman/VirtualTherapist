<b>N</b><i>OW YOU ARE ALL ALONE, except for us.... No one at home
wants you back. There has been a death in your family,
Kenny; it is you. In the big city, you can jump from buildings
so high they touch the sky. Imagine the mess you'll make when
you hit the street. Climb a tall building, Kenny. Then fly and
die. We'll help ... we'll help ... we'll help. No one else cares.
We'll help</i>.


Cowering in my seat on the train, I believed that the
voices were right, that I was hurtling toward my death in a
place I did not know. Though New York City was only two
hours from New Haven by train, I had never been there.
There was some talk in our family of visiting New York during
the summer of 1964 to attend the World's Fair, and I
remember being cautiously excited at the prospect--wanting
to go, yet afraid to venture forth--but somehow our
plans were changed. Instead, we traveled to Pittsburgh to see

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I buried my head in the help-wanted section of the New
York newspaper that my father had handed me before he left.
Employment agencies offered all sorts of publishing jobs,
including some for beginners. I circled the names of several
agencies, planning to visit them first thing the next morning.
And then a curious thing happened: Though the voices were
still jabbering at me, for the first time in a long while I felt a
sense of hope. Something about making plans helped me get
hold of myself, giving me courage to meet the challenges that
lay immediately ahead.


Nothing, however, had prepared me for Grand Central
Station. The main concourse, one of the grandest rooms ever
built in America--120 feet wide, 375 feet long--was surmounted
by a vaulted ceiling studded with electric stars.
Against one wall, a Kodak exhibit showed a picture of happy
children celebrating the holidays in a warm family setting.
How very different this scene was from the dismal time our
family had just spent "celebrating" the holidays, pretending
that ours was a normal, happy family.


Loudspeakers blared. People rushed to catch departing
trains and meet arriving passengers. The redcap who had
helped me with my luggage asked if I needed a cab. "I don't
have money for a cab," I said.


He looked at me, probably dismissing any chance for a
tip, and said, "See that word strike on the front page of your

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'd reserved a room at the YMCA Sloane House on West
Thirty-fourth Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues,
eight streets south and many blocks west of Grand Central.
"You're not gonna be able to tote all this stuff by yourself,"
said the redcap. He directed me to a locker, where I stored
the trunk, inserting enough coins in the slot to buy time
until the following afternoon. Above the roar of the people,
trains, loudspeakers, the voices in my head shouted to be
heard. <i>Little boy swallowed up by the big city, they said. Lost,
lost, you're losing it, Kenny. This is your crypt. You will lie here
when you die</i>. I found myself paralyzed by fear and confusion.
I looked about the concourse. Which way was out?


There I stood--a teenager six feet tall, 150 pounds, wearing
pants that were too short and carrying a worn suitcase. I
looked very much alone and exposed. A man approached. He
reminded me of one of my junior high school teachers: tall,
slim, in his early thirties. When he spoke, his voice was soft.
"You look lost," the man said. He had a nice smile. "Are you
waiting for someone?" When I said no, he asked if I needed a
place to sleep. I told him I'd reserved a room at Sloane House.
His smile faded momentarily, but then he said that he knew
Sloane House well. It was where he had stayed when he first
came to New York. His name was Ted, he said, and he shared
an apartment with roommates at Forty-third and Eighth.
"You'll have to come by for a visit sometime," Ted said, and
then offered to accompany me to the Y so that I wouldn't get
lost. I couldn't believe my luck in meeting this helpful
stranger. Together, we left the station and walked out into a
light rain.

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The glistening streets were bustling with people. Cars
whizzed by; drivers beeped their horns. All around there
was noise and movement, yet I found myself strangely
unafraid. For a boy who'd been too frightened to venture out
to the mailbox at home, I was easily navigating the city ...
and in broad daylight. There was safety for me in the city's
anonymity. I walked with a jaunty step.


At the Y, the man at the desk greeted Ted like an old
friend. I signed in, got a key, and carried my suitcase to my
room. The door opened onto a space hardly bigger than a
closet. It held a small bed, dresser, mirror, and sink (which I
soon learned not to use because it reeked of urine, a result of
previous occupants' reluctance to visit the hall bathroom
when nature called). The room was overheated, the windows
painted shut. But I was not alarmed. I had a room, a friend,
hope for a job.


Ted had invited me to join him at a nearby diner--his
treat--to celebrate my first day in New York. I quickly
returned to the lobby, where he was waiting. We had coffee
and a toasted bagel spread with cream cheese, a treat so
exotic to a small-town boy that it might as well have been
pâté de foie gras. I told Ted that I planned to look for a job
the following morning, but I made an appointment to meet
him in the afternoon near the lockers at Grand Central so he
could help me retrieve my trunk.


That night, I couldn't sleep. The voices had made themselves
at home in my new surroundings and quickly busied
themselves devising new ways for me to destroy myself: In
the big city, jumping from a skyscraper quickly replaced
hanging from a tall tree as the suicide method of choice.
Attempting to impose order on the chaos of my disordered

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Monday morning, with the subways and buses not running,
I walked to the first of three employment agencies
listed in the classifieds. The woman at the reception desk dismissed
me quickly because, she told me, I needed a high
school diploma. At the second agency, I added a year to my
age and a diploma to my credentials. <i>Liar</i>, chided the voices.
<i>Shame on you. Don't you know that lying is a sin?</i>


The lie worked. There was an opening for a copyboy at
Fairchild Publications, said the woman who interviewed me.
She would set up an appointment for later that week.


"Why can't I go today?" I asked.


"You'll have to walk down to Twelfth Street and Fifth
Avenue," she said. "That's miles away."


"That's okay, I don't mind walking," I said.


At Fairchild, publishers of <i>Women's Wear Daily</i>, I was
directed to the personnel office. I filled out an application,
was interviewed by a friendly woman in a blue suit, and
toured the maze of offices with another copyboy. People
were talking on the phone, clacking away at their typewriters,
taking a break for yet another cup of coffee. My job
would be to route mail to staff mailboxes. I returned to personnel,
where the nice woman said that she'd been impressed
by my willingness to hike two miles downtown for an interview.
She hired me for the princely sum of sixty-five dollars
a week, starting the following morning.


I was elated and couldn't wait to share my good news
with my new friend.

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You're late," Ted said when I met him at the lockers.


"I'm sorry," I said, "but wait till you hear why. I just
walked up here from my new job!"


He looked at me long and silently. It seemed to me that he
was not pleased. Eventually, he said, "Well, let's get your
trunk back to the Y. Then you can join me for lunch." I was
eager to return to the Y so I could update my residential tenant
card to reflect my new employment status.


At the diner, we were joined in the booth by another
man. "This is Nick, a friend from the neighborhood," Ted
said.


Nick was younger than Ted--in his twenties, I guessed--
but he looked worn out. His skin was swarthy, and there
were dark circles under his eyes, which seemed lifeless. His
hair was thick and matted. Nick held out his hand and
smiled, revealing yellow teeth. There was a diseased smell to
his breath.


"Sorry," I said to Ted, stammering an excuse. "I forgot
that I have to go back to the agency and pay them their fee.
Maybe we can get together another time." Hurriedly, I
backed out of the diner. The story about going back to the
agency was true, but the reason for my leaving was to
quickly put distance between Nick and me. I sensed something
ominous about the man. It would be a while before I
found out just how right I was.


My first few months in New York went reasonably well. Once
or twice, I visited the Showcase Theater--the alleged reason
for my coming to the city--but soon discovered that the
writing program was a scam. I was given a few assignments
having to do with the use of verbs--silly stuff that I was still

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My job offered no such respite. <i>Take a walk, Kenny. Find
a good building to jump from. You've got the time. Let's see
what buildings are available in the neighborhood</i>. As a copyboy,
I could (and did) wander off for long periods without
being missed. Sometimes, I would go to Schrafft's, a corner
restaurant with marble floors, cloth-covered tables, a large
counter, a case displaying chocolates for sale, and waitresses
with crisp uniforms and starched white hats who created a
wonderful feeling of calm and quiet. Every so often, I'd run
into Ted there. He had some business in the area, he'd
explain. Ted made a point of being available, and I generally
was pleased to see him. For some reason, the voices never
seized on Ted, never told me he was wicked or out to hurt
me. I felt safe with him.


Ted and I might have a soda and sandwich at the counter.
We'd talk for a while--about how the job was going, what I
was planning to do that evening (stay in my room or go to
the library on nights when it was open late). Eventually, I'd
head back to the office, where I might drop off mail at the
desks of publisher James Brady or film critic Rex Reed. Since
the job demanded little interaction with other staff members,
nobody commented on my long absences.


To my surprise, after a couple of months on the job, I was
offered the position of editorial assistant at <i>Men's Wear</i> magazine,
another Fairchild publication. This new job involved

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And so I'd leave, letting my mind wander off into the
world of the voices for several hours every day while my
body remained at my desk. In my chaotic state, thoughts
often came and went, and I could not catch them. Thoughts
about dying and about how I would be mourned. Thoughts
about destroying the voices. The work on my desk didn't
engage me the way my favorite books had done. The next
thing I knew, the managing editor was standing over me,
saying, "Haven't you finished that job yet?" or, holding a set
of galleys in his hand, "You clearly didn't proofread this
thoroughly." I was making more and more errors. The editor
warned me several times to shape up, but my mental turmoil
prevented me from heeding those warnings. His was the outside
world, and I was increasingly living in a world of inner
demons. I found it impossible to concentrate on any one
thing for more than a few minutes. My career as an editorial
assistant turned out to be short-lived. I had lasted in the real
world of work a little more than six months. I was laid off
and given a generous four weeks' severance pay.


Losing the job meant losing whatever structure I had
managed to impose on my life. And now I was also losing the
salary on which I depended. Although I continued to receive
a monthly allowance from my father, it wasn't enough to
cover room and board. Nor did I feel that I could call home

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The fact that I'm here today is a sign of some greater
power working in my life, I believe, since I'm now aware that
one in thirteen schizophrenics do heed the instructions of
their alien spirits to end their own lives. Many's the time that
I came so close to being part of that awful statistic and
stopped or was prevented by others from destroying myself.


One day toward the end of August 1966, when I was
down to my last few dollars (and terrified that I would be
evicted from my room for not paying the rent), I walked out
on the street, where once again--by incredible chance, I
thought--I happened to meet Ted outside the Y. "You look
awful," he said. It may have been weeks since I had changed
my clothes. My shirt was missing buttons; my pants hung on
my slight frame. I didn't remember the last time I had eaten.


"I don't have money to do laundry," I said, as if that were
the most troubling aspect of my situation. We went to lunch
(Ted's treat again; I ate ravenously), then he gave me a handful
of change for the washing machine. "Clean yourself up,
kid," he said, "and I'll take you to dinner. Wear those jeans
that I like--the white ones that are a little tight on you. And
comb your hair."


I did as instructed, arriving at "our diner" at seven. By
now, I knew many of the regulars by sight. They were not

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ted greeted me. Nick nodded briefly, then got right to the
point. "Do you owe Sloane House rent?"


"No, I'm paid up through tomorrow."


"Do you have any money?"


"No." I had spent all of my allowance. If I moved out of
the Y without leaving a forwarding address and my dad sent
me money, any mail directed to me would be marked RETURN
TO SENDER. I realized that I had probably received my last
check from home.


"Teddy found you, and he's taken a liking to you," Nick
said. "Do you like him?"


"Yes, I do," I said truthfully.


"Ted wants you to have sex with him," said Nick. "Is that
okay with you?"


To understand my answer, it's important to take you
where I was at that time. Since I'd been fired, my fear of
strangers had returned and, with it, my isolation. Once again,
I had taken to spending entire days and nights in my room,
the walls closing in on me, with no Grandma to bring me a
hot supper and make sure I ate it. My sole companions were
the voices, and they only reinforced my sense of defeat. In
this state, the thought of any contact with a friendly human
being seemed to offer some vague relief. As I saw it then, I
had but two choices: phone my father and tell him I had
failed or go with Ted. With great reluctance, I chose the latter.


I looked my friend Ted straight in the eyes. He was waiting
for my answer. Turning away, I whispered, "Yes."

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Nick then set forth the terms of my "employment."


"Understand, you work for me now," he said. "Teddy will
give you a place to live, and he will feed and clothe you.
Teddy gets you first because he recruited you. I'll have you
when I'm in the mood. And then there are the customers--
older men who like young boys. We call them chickenhawks.
It's your job to keep them happy. I'll handle all appointments
and financial arrangements. You bring any tips and gifts to
me, and I'll give you some of what you bring in if I hear
you're worth rewarding. Clear?"


I must have nodded, because Nick rose and walked out
into the early night. Ted and I ate dinner in silence. Then we
went to the Y, picked up my luggage, and took a cab to Ted's
apartment, where we had sex. "You're one of the boys of
Eighth Avenue now," Ted told me, his arms wrapped around
me as he drifted off. But I did not sleep, and not just because
my voices ranted at me without pause. <i>What would your
priest think of you now? What would Grandma say if she could
see her little Kenny? ... So you came to the big city to be a
tramp, a male queer whore. Well, aren't you proud that you've
accomplished that! Dirty boy, you really deserve to die. Die, die,
die</i>.


In a very real sense, a part of me had just done that.


And so I entered the world of the male hustler, a world
that revolved around "dates," mostly meetings with middle-aged
and older men at a hotel or apartment--all of them prearranged
and prepaid. Less often, I would join other boys at
one of the bars along Eighth Avenue where we were known
and protected.


Eighth Avenue from Thirty-fourth to Forty-eighth Streets
was dotted with triple XXX theaters that featured pornographic

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As a new acquisition, I was in great demand. Still, whenever
my date was over, late night or early morning, I
returned "home," where Ted was waiting. He expected our
relationship to continue on a sex-on-demand basis, meaning
every night, and was visibly upset when I told him, one
night, that I couldn't do that and handle all the other men. It
was part of our bargain, he said. He had made many sacrifices
for me, he reminded me. He had clothed and fed me.
Since meeting me, he had sent his other roommates away. All
of that was true, but to my own amazement I stood my

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A few days later, he told me that Nick wanted to see me at
his place. I was nervous as I headed for Greenwich Village
late that afternoon. I thought Nick was going to tell me off
but good for defying Ted, and I wasn't sure how I'd respond.
By the time I reached the four-story brownstone where Nick
lived, I was in a state of near panic.


My first impression of Nick's apartment was that it was
elegant--high ceilings, brick walls, working fireplace--and
that it was clean, a surprise given that its owner always
looked as if he could use a good scrubbing. Nick was a night
creature. If he hadn't existed in the real world, he's the kind
of demon that my schizophrenic mind would have created. I
stared at him now. He was not wearing a shirt, and I noticed
that, like an animal, he had dark hair covering both chest
and back. Feeling revulsion, I stepped back into the hallway.


"Come on in, Kenny."


I reentered, and Nick closed the door behind me.


"The time has come for me to have the boy they're all raving
about," he said, pulling me toward him. He kissed me,
putting his tongue in my mouth. I gagged. I was prey in the
hands of the predator.


<i>"Be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour."</i> In that
instant, I heard Grandma's voice and grasped the true meaning
of the Scripture she had quoted me in what now seemed
a lifetime ago. For surely, Nick was the devil. It followed,
then, that letting him devour me would be an unpardonable
sin.


I thought, <i>I'd rather go out and kill myself than do this</i>.

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I told Nick I had to wash up and would join him afterward.
As he went into the bedroom, I made for the front
door, opened it, and bolted down the stairs and into the
street. I ran like a marathoner, pausing only to catch my
breath. All night long, I alternately ran and staggered, not
knowing where I was headed or what I was going to do. I
stopped and stared into restaurants, looking at the food and
the people inside. I did not sleep or eat. Sometime the next
day, I found my way to the entrance of the main library at
Fifth Avenue and Fortieth Street. I went inside. My feet
ached. My shoes--the same ones I had worn when I left
home--had holes in the soles. I remember wishing I could
take off the shoes and soothe my feet against the cool marble
floors. Among the stacks, I found a book about World War II
and took it to a table in the wood-paneled main reading
room, where I alternately read and dozed until a guard gently
nudged me and told me the library was closing.


Back outside the entrance, I was startled by the pair of
large marble lions that stand guard before the building.
<i>"Your adversary, as a roaring lion, walketh about ..."</i> Superimposed
on the lion's visage I saw Nick's face surrounded by
a mane of matted hair. The sight of the library lions usually
comforted me, but in my frenzied state I feared the wrath of
the Nick-lions. I was convinced that Nick and Ted were out
hunting for me and that, if they caught me, I'd be forced to
do the unthinkable. I saw Nick's face on every person who
passed, and I trembled with terror.


My only way out was to heed the voices. Walking the
streets in the darkening city, I searched for a building to
jump from. <i>This is the time to find the building ... the building
that touches the sky ... and you can jump. That's the way to do</i>

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What business do you have here? Who are you going to
see?" When I couldn't come up with an answer, I was turned
away by the security guard at the Empire State Building.
Disheveled and muttering to myself, I didn't look like the
kind of person you want roaming around any place you're
guarding. Other buildings, other doormen ... again and
again, I was stopped and turned away. Heading west, I managed
to gain entry to several buildings that were unsecured
and unguarded, but when I reached the top floor, I found
access to the roof barred.


Finally, my search led to a building where, after walking
countless steps from the ground floor to the top, I located a
door that swung open to the roof. I had made it! Edging to
the building's western perimeter, I looked down on a huge
parking lot filled with postal trucks. Beyond the lot was an
elevated highway where cars sped past one another in
opposing directions, their headlights forming patterns of ribbons
on the roadway. The scene was dizzying. I lowered
myself to the tar surface of the roof, crawled to a space at the
corner where I would be sheltered on two sides, and slept till
dawn.


The hours that followed are hazy in my memory. I must
have paced the roof. I know that at some point I sat on the
edge of the building, my feet dangling over the side, and
looked down, trying to decide the best spot to hit the
ground. As I was plotting my death, I was unaware that the
buildings around me, buildings even taller than the one I

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I can only imagine the horror they felt when they saw me
perched precariously at the building's rim, how they called
to one another to verify what they were seeing, and how
they then phoned for help. "Hurry! It's an emergency!
There's a guy on the roof of the building across the way, and
he looks like he's going to jump!"


Suddenly, the roof filled with a large cast of characters--
police, firefighters, ambulance workers, voices--all bent on
assaulting me. <i>Look at all the people, my voices were saying.
They're here to push you over if you don't do it yourself. Coward.
Do it now</i>. At the same time, the police officers attacked
me with <i>their</i> questions: "How did you get up here? Did
somebody let you in? How long have you been here? <i>Why</i>
are you here?"


Bombarded by sound and confusion, I stood like a deer
caught in headlights, unable to move or make a sound.


"Stop yelling at him and he may answer you." The
speaker, a man in a regular business suit, took command.
The outside voices quieted down.


"Why are you here, son?" the speaker asked me in a normal,
conversational voice.


"I'm here because I want to die."


"Why do you want to die?"


"I'm being commanded to jump off this building."


"By whom?"


"The voices are telling me to do it. They're telling me not
to wait. If I don't do it myself, they will follow me to hell. I

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Get him!" shouted one of the police officers.


"Stand still," said the man in the suit firmly. I didn't
know if he was speaking to me or to the officer. We both
stopped.


"Go away," I said, pleading with everyone. "I don't want
your help."


"Would you like the voices to stop without your having
to die?" asked the man in the suit.


The circle of men seemed to be getting closer and closer to
me. The voices were telling me, <i>See how they're drawing
nearer? Be careful, Kenny. They're going to push you over.
They're going to do your job for you. Do it yourself, do it now</i>.
Perception or reality? In my mind's eye, I saw the circle closing
in, and I drew back again.


"Wait," said the speaker. "I can help you. There is medicine
that can make the voices go away. Would you like that?
Come with me. Let's leave the building together, just the two
of us. Let's go get rid of the voices." Slowly, he began walking
toward me.


I let him take my hand and lead me to the door, not
because of the promise of relief from the voices, but because
I felt too confused and too worn out to make decisions. This
is a common feeling in schizophrenia, one that I would experience
many more times over the years. There was nothing

sedative and tranquilizer. I felt wobbly. The dosage was so
high, I couldn't stand or speak. It was like being a living potted
plant, one that wants to spread and grow but is kept in
its place by careful pruning. I think I was given a shot every
four hours. My lips became very thick, as if they were growing
a second or third layer of skin. They were dry and
started to crack.


All of this did not happen in a day, of course. I lost track
of just how long I remained in this hospital. I lost track of
everything. For a time, I even lost track of the voices. They
were as sedated as I.


And then they came back with a vengeance.
