BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> How are you?
<b>PT:</b> How you doing?
<b>DR:</b> Hanging in there?
<b>PT:</b> Trying.
<b>DR:</b> Is your wife coming?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's in the bathroom, my daughter can just sit out there.
<b>DR:</b> You sure you don't want her to join?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if she'd be uncomfortable about it or what.
<b>DR:</b> Ask her.  Okay, should we wait for your wife?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we could.  I just, do you got the paperwork about what happened with the disability.
<b>DR:</b> You were in Isreal and somehow you got it back?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I faxed them, I faxed them because I got that issue coming up again, short term.
<b>DR:</b> What's the issue now?
<b>PT:</b> It's just, last time I was working, I just couldn't keep together as far as what I had to do.  I got to a point, I forgot one person died, believe it or not, because I had a busy weekend.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And that created quite a bit of problems for me.
<b>DR:</b> What was the problem, how did it -
<b>PT:</b> A combination of stress and I just got to the point, I couldn't, I just couldn't do it.  Thirty eight years then all of the sudden it's just, it's coming apart.
<b>DR:</b> What do you attribute it to?
<b>PT:</b> I couldn't even tell you.  It's just probably I was so worried about just trying to do -
<b>DR:</b> Where you anxious?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, definitely.
<b>DR:</b> Mood wise, now?
<b>PT:</b> It's, it changes but it's been okay with what you have me taking but I take [INAUDIBLE] later in the afternoon around three o'clock and it starts like this and then by the time, you know, if I'm out for a while with something, by the time when she gets home it's just like -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I saw you on [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> At that point your mood was low, you were 6 out of 10, fifty or sixty percent of the time sad, you were irritable, you were anxious, your appetite was good, you were exercising some, you were sleeping fine, self esteem was low.  You had a full cardiac work up, that was negative.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> You had some passive suicidal thoughts, don't plan to hurt yourself.  Your libido was kind of low, your sex drive was low.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> We switched you over to Vivactil.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Correct?  Are you on that now?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're taking two?  What is it, 20 mg?
<b>PT:</b> Two of the 10's, right, and then Wellbutrin.
<b>DR:</b> Now are you off the Effexor?
<b>PT:</b> Definitely.
<b>DR:</b> Did you have trouble getting off it?
<b>PT:</b> I guess the only thing I can equate it to is like when you stop smoking after you've been smoking for a long time.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Just like I was really irritated and jittery.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Hi, come on back.
<b>CG:</b> Hi, okay. 
<b>DR:</b> Do you want your daughter to join us or no?
<b>CG:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> She just came with you for a day in the city?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we're going to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, nice.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so just to review a little bit for your wife, back in October his mood was lower, he really had some suicidal thoughts, he was, you know, not at his best.  He was quite irritable and anxious, sad much of the time.  We switched him over from the Effexor to Vivactil then and we maintained the Lamictal at 200, the Wellbutrin at 200, correct?
<b>CG:</b> I think the Lamictal was one and a half
<b>PT:</b> Back in the beginning but we cut back to one tablet which is 200, before it was 300.
<b>CG:</b> Right, so you said Lamictal 200.
<b>DR:</b> So currently you're on how much?
<b>CG:</b> Currently, 200.
<b>DR:</b> 200.
<b>CG:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And you're on Wellbutrin 200.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>CG:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> You're on 0.5 mg of Ativan if you need it.
<b>PT:</b> If I need it.  It's only if I need it.
<b>DR:</b> Have you needed it much?
<b>PT:</b> The past couple days.
<b>DR:</b> But generally no?
<b>PT:</b> Generally no overall.
<b>DR:</b> Because without work there's not, not as much stress.
<b>CG:</b> Well and when we spoke to you, you said -
<b>DR:</b> Get rid of everything that -
<b>CG:</b> The changes.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>CG:</b> You know, let's just wait till this all clears, no alcohol.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so let's, because I don't have in the chart what happened, so after we met in October.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Something changed, you became a bit toxic, right, when was that?
<b>CG:</b> Well, I guess it was like the last week of it.
<b>DR:</b> So about six weeks ago.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's when I started making mistakes at work.
<b>DR:</b> And this was as we were tapering off the Effexor or as we were starting the Vivactil?
<b>CG:</b> No, he had been tapered off the Effexor for at least a week and a half.
<b>DR:</b> And the Vivactil was on and do we think Vivactil has helped?
<b>CG:</b> Well, initially I thought the Vivactil helped.  He was on 30 mg at that time.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>CG:</b> Initially, it looked like things were going okay and then I don't know what happened, I just started hearing things that he was saying and doing that he had made mistakes at work and they had -
<b>DR:</b> You know what I thought it was eventually, I thought you were using too much of the Ativan.  Were you drinking at all?
<b>PT:</b> Just if I had something, it was at night, you know, for dinner but I wasn't like out binge drinking or anything like that.
<b>CG:</b> Oh, no, he was -
<b>DR:</b> Not much alcohol.
<b>CG:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> But you were popping more of the Ativan?
<b>CG:</b> No, I don't think he was because you cautioned him about that, so I think, I think when we spoke to you on the phone when we were at that crisis point, you felt that it may have been the Vivactil, moving it down to 20 seemed to be the thing that helped him within a few days.
<b>DR:</b> So it may have been what we call the anticholinergic effects of Vivactil.  Vivactil can do that, it doesn't usually do that.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> And you know, many people are on much higher doses but going down seemed to be better for you so we have to assume now.
<b>CG:</b> And at that time, if you were taking any of the antianxiety thing, it was only 0.25 once a day, if you were even taking -
<b>PT:</b> No, I was taking one tablet, so that was 0.5.
<b>CG:</b> Okay, so that was -
<b>PT:</b> And I would take it in the morning.
<b>CG:</b> 0.5, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you got into this state and is that the state that got you into trouble at work or since then -
<b>PT:</b> They had to talk to me twice because two weekends that I was on in a row that it was busy then all of the sudden it just got messed up.  I just couldn't keep up with the work.  I was forgetting things.
<b>DR:</b> In a cognitive, your thinking wasn't, it wasn't an emotional problem?
<b>PT:</b> A combination.
<b>DR:</b> Were you anxious?
<b>PT:</b> I was getting upset, extremely anxious and then the worst thing was the second weekend that I worked, right before the primary told me to get out, that's when I was busy and I took, somebody died and I was like in the middle of four things that I was trying to accomplish, I took the information and started making up a file, put it down in an area to where everybody has access to the file, I didn't write the name on the board and I completely, it was just like my mind flushed, completely forgot it.  They asked me the name, you know, when I came in on Monday, I couldn't even tell them because I just, it was like it never happened, so out of that, I had the regional marketing manager, I had to sit down with him and then we got into this discussion about I can be terminated because of it and then the second time it happened, I just wanted to get the heck out of there, I've had it. 
<b>DR:</b> And your primary doc worked out the disability.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he put down for going back possibly on the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> Do you want to go back or do you -
<b>PT:</b> You know, I'd just assume, that's it.
<b>DR:</b> You're tired.
<b>CG:</b> He had a meltdown on Sunday.
<b>DR:</b> But now we're out of those side effects, now we're talking about something different.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, what happened on, so after all that and we pulled back on the Vivactil.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And you went on disability, did things get better?
<b>PT:</b> Partially.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, I think that the cognitive changes were quite diminished after several days.
<b>DR:</b> Does he have any now?
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, off and on, off and on and I don't know -
<b>DR:</b> What kind of cognitive problem?
<b>CG:</b> Well, like he'll ask me the same question often and I don't, you know, like sometimes it's during the same day, sometimes it's the follow day.  I don't know that, I mean I guess you're the judge of it, is that a cognitive problem, it's not the same type of cognitive problem.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have memory problems, is it hard to remember things?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I guess I do repeat myself but I'm not aware of it.
<b>DR:</b> Are you anxious much of the time?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What are you anxious about?  You don't have work to worry about.
<b>PT:</b> Just in general, I don't know why.  If I go out in public, when I tried to do a little shopping for Christmas, I was okay for a while, then I started to break out in a sweat and I realized I had to get back home, so basically that's it, I went back home.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, why, was there danger?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Did you feel like it was dangerous out there?
<b>PT:</b> I just felt like it was closing in.
<b>DR:</b> Have you had any panic attacks?
<b>PT:</b> Define panic attack?
<b>DR:</b> Panic attack is all the sudden out of nowhere you feel like you're going to die.  Crushing in your chest, sweat in your palms, can't catch your breath.
<b>PT:</b> I had chest pain, I just had another episode.
<b>CG:</b> That was Sunday, he had -
<b>DR:</b> So he's getting more panic attacks and that can explain much of this, right, if you get into a panic state, you can't think.
<b>CG:</b> Right and you know what, I think that we've discussed this before about how, you know, sometimes when he starts in that mode and he becomes a magnet for negativity and how we have, our daughter has fortunately had three college acceptance letters so we know that's happening, it's the concern that our baby is leaving, is the concern that he's on disability and he doesn't know how he would pay for this, is the concern that he's worked his entire life and although he gets extremely panicky about the fact that he would ever have to return to that particular environment, I mean these are the things that are like dwelling distractions in his head and I don't know whether the cognitive changes or more anxiety panic that's preventing him from concentrating on what's being said -
<b>DR:</b> It sounds like anxiety.  I mean it sounds like he's really nervous about -
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, it's like, it's like a multitude of life changing things.
<b>PT:</b> And the more I get into it, then the torticollis really kicks in.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I suspect one of the problems I had is with the torticollis and my head starts turning.   A lot of the stuff I have to do is either handwriting, you know, I've got to file and start things or doing work on a computer to generate everything, that's when I start making clerical mistakes because my eyes jump back like this and then they kind of jump the other way so it's just, it seems like a multitude.
<b>CG:</b> But, you know, in addition to that, I mean I do have to say that, and this has never been verbalized even between the two of us, but you know, it was four and a half years ago that I had a life threatening illness and truthfully there has been a decline, although it was subtle initially because I think I was still trying to process that, but in his business he does deal with people who die of cancer and I was noticing that the more often he had to deal with families who had a member die of cancer that it was becoming more and more difficult for him and I guess, you know, if it was a female and she was fairly young, it was even more difficult, although he never really verbalized it, it was just something that I observed and I never really started putting two and two together myself until fairly recently and then this past Sunday, he was so distraught.
<b>DR:</b> Over what?
<b>CG:</b> And we had to, I'm not really even sure.
<b>DR:</b> Let him tell me, what happened?
<b>PT:</b> I started thinking about things at work, I was really agitated because I've got to make a decision about it I guess, whether I go back or take the disability and just start from there.
<b>DR:</b> You don't have to decide yet.
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm just trying to keep it in the short term.  I don't know, I couldn't tell you, it's probably like four or five different things jumping in and out of my head and it just started to snowball and I don't know if you remember but I'd sleep until about eleven o'clock, get up, it would take me a couple of hours just to get situated and think about trying to do something.  That project that I have that I work on in the garage, I was only approaching it for about a half hour to forty minutes, then I just couldn't do it anymore.  I went back in the house or went out, went and got a cup of coffee and a paper, come back read it and then by that time she's home, my daughter has been home and goes out for what she's got to do and that's how I live.  
<b>CG:</b> But in particular on Sunday.
<b>DR:</b> What happened Sunday?
<b>PT:</b> I absolutely don't remember that much, I've got to tell you and it goes like this, somebody will, you know, she'll ask me about something.
<b>DR:</b> Well, hold on, she said something big happened Sunday, do the best you can, don't ask her.
<b>PT:</b> I just started -
<b>DR:</b> No, no, don't look at her, tell me what happened Sunday.
<b>PT:</b> I know I was upset and I would just sit there and start crying.  I think that's when I had this severe pain right in here, almost like somebody stabbed me, then I was worried about the college expenses for my daughter, even though, good kid, she got, you know, some scholarship offered by each, all three.
<b>DR:</b> Right, what happened, in what way did you unravel on Sunday, I'm not -
<b>PT:</b> I have a hard time focusing, I just sit down and start thinking about things.  I get agitated, you know
<b>DR:</b> So all of the sudden out of nowhere?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just start thinking about something.  I think I have this still eating me about work because I know if I go back and something else happens, that's it, I'm out of there and that's -
<b>DR:</b> So how long did it last, this agitated state he was in?
<b>CG:</b> Well, the agitated state I guess began like hours before the final meltdown and it began with like a pain in his chest.
<b>PT:</b> It was almost like a bubble started hurting right here and it wouldn't go away.
<b>CG:</b> And he does have GERD so I mean, you know, it could have been partially some of that but then we went to that -
<b>DR:</b> Were you feeling like you were going to die?  Were you short of breath?
<b>PT:</b> I'd say a little bit but if I think about dying, sometimes when I'm alone towards the night, I just get these thoughts, you know, well hit [AGE] what's next and being in the business -
<b>DR:</b> I'm talking about just this event though -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's more prominent on Sunday I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I just hit a cycle.
<b>DR:</b> And then what happened?
<b>CG:</b> Well then, you know, we bought a Christmas tree, we came home, I looked at him and I knew something was wrong and he walked into the living room and he like just control himself and then I sat down and I spoke with him about too much, except how he was feeling physically and physically in pain but he had kept holding his arm and I was trying to figure out was this a cardiac thing but it didn't seem like it was and so I know you had said last time we spoke, no Xanax and he hadn't had any at that time and then -
<b>PT:</b> I felt like I calmed down.
<b>CG:</b> And I set the timer for twenty minutes because I thought by twenty minutes something should change and it did begin to level out a little bit and then I asked him why he wanted me to, you know, that he brought up the thing about the gun and he just said because these mood swings and I just don't know what's happening to me, I just don't want it to be here -
<b>DR:</b> And that was just that day or you stayed suicidal?
<b>PT:</b> I've had thoughts for a while.
<b>DR:</b> How long?
<b>PT:</b> A few months.
<b>DR:</b> So really since we went off the Effexor.  It sounds like the Vivactil has not covered what we lost on the Effexor.
<b>PT:</b> How long ago was the Effexor dose cut off?
<b>DR:</b> It was two months ago.
<b>CG:</b> Well last time, doctor, yeah, so the weaning program and so -
<b>DR:</b> So you've become more suicidal.  It sounds like you've become more depressed, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Would you say you're sad much of the time?
<b>PT:</b> Plenty of time.
<b>DR:</b> And you're anxious for sure.  What's your appetite like?
<b>PT:</b> I've never had a problem with that.  I mean if I was doing something, during the day now I could forget to eat at noon, you know, one o'clock.  Sometimes I'll make something around two or three.
<b>DR:</b> Are you losing weight?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, pretty much.  I mean I'd watch TV downstairs, fall asleep around one o'clock in the morning, I'd get up about two, go up to bed, I could fall back asleep.
<b>DR:</b> Do you wake up in the early hours of the morning?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel really bad in the morning, are you at your worst in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I feel dragging until I get some coffee.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And then I start thinking about the day.
<b>DR:</b> Are you able to concentrate okay or you're easily distracted?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm distracted with stupid things.
<b>DR:</b> Is it hard to make decisions?
<b>PT:</b> I hate to tell her because of all she's going through.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel kind of guilty?  Self esteem is pretty low?  Are you able to get pleasure from anything?
<b>PT:</b> Watching my daughter's swim meets.
<b>DR:</b> Is it hard to anticipate pleasure, to think that's going to be fun?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I always try and sit someplace where I can hold my head so I don't start shaking.
<b>DR:</b> Are you getting worse?
<b>PT:</b> It goes in phases, like right now I guess the Botox has kicked in and it's not really that bad but around my birthday, we were with a bunch of people and I kind of like Japanese and so does my daughter, how many people?  And these are all people I know that I'm really close with.
<b>CG:</b> About ten, twelve people.
<b>PT:</b> I was constantly forcing myself to look back and really became self conscious.
<b>CG:</b> Now can I ask a question about like the peaks and valleys of the Vivactil?  I was noticing that between three and six in the afternoon, a very low point and then he was able to pick himself up, right [PATIENT NAME] or were you just pretending because you didn't want to bother me?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> A lot of people get in situations, a lot of people get those afternoon dips.  Are things worse for you in the wintertime when the days are short?
<b>PT:</b> Again, she would think so, that might have something to do -
<b>DR:</b> Well, Christmas', was Christmas this year -
<b>PT:</b> It sucks.
<b>CG:</b> You know what and that's what I said to you.
<b>DR:</b> But most years it's -
<b>PT:</b> I can't even get to put up the tree and trees in the summer, I've got to try and bring it in and stuff -
<b>CG:</b> I mean his childhood Christmas was never good and that was one of the things I was trying to ask him about on Sunday, do you think that some of this was precipitated by the fact that we were out buying the Christmas tree and that we know we don't really have a lot of funds for Christmas this year and that you had always overcompensated for Christmas because in your family there never was anything wonderful and ever since you were working on your own, you always overcompensated, I know that from your nieces and was that part of what caused, I don't know and I mean -
<b>DR:</b> You're looking too much for, you know, psychological reasons -
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Those aren't that important.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> His brain is not functioning the way it should.  All those things are relevant on some level but their relevant to everyone, everyone has got psychodynamic issues.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> His brain is not working, it's really, he's stuck in a depressive state and we've got to get him out of it.  I suspect that the Vivactil at the 30 was too anticholinergic and so we had to pull you below a dose, below the threshold that you need for the depression and so you've been uncovered, you're at quite a low Wellbutrin dose and too low a Vivactil dose.  Now Vivactil is in a class of medicine called tricyclic antidepressants.  The good thing about tricyclics, the reason we choose it is they have norepinephrine, they increase norepinephrine and we've always found that norepinephrine is your medicine.  The Effexor at the high dose has norepinephrine; I mean it's what we need.  The problem with it is you had more side effects.  I mean the Vivactil, the tricyclics, they're much stronger than the new meds but they have more side effects.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And the side effects are the anticholinergic side effects, you know, cognitive, there's some dry mouth, there's sedation, there's -
<b>PT:</b> I have cottonmouth.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Even so, I'd like, I need to get one of these medicines on board at a dose that's going to tamp down his depressive illness so I'd like to trade within the tricyclic class to something that's less anticholinergic, something that we can push the dose a little better.  Have you ever heard of Nortriptyline or Desipramine?
<b>PT:</b> I never have.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> Nortriptyline, yes, I was on Nortriptyline.
<b>DR:</b> Well, Nortriptyline is a good medicine.  One of the good things about Nortriptyline is we can check a blood level.   If you're not doing well, we can check a blood level and the blood level tells us if you're at the right dose. 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> It's the only antidepressant that we know what the dose, what dose, what blood level gets you better, so I'll trade the Vivactil for Nortriptyline.  I think we should get rid of Wellbutrin at this point.  Do you think Wellbutrin is helping?
<b>PT:</b> Truthfully, I don't think anything to me has been helping. 
<b>DR:</b> It can give you some dry mouth and you're at too low a dose for it to be -
<b>CG:</b> I don't really think it's -
<b>DR:</b> And it's not a big, it's not a big, for someone as depressed as you are, so Wellbutrin goes in the garbage.  We keep the Lamictal because you've not been unstable, you've been depressed, you know, even though it seems like unstable, like moodiness, it's irritability.
<b>CG:</b> You know what, he forgot his Lamictal on Saturday night.
<b>DR:</b> Really.
<b>CG:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> That Sunday, that's enough, I've seen that frequently.
<b>CG:</b> That's what I said to him.  He said but do you think because I'm only, it was only that one day -
<b>DR:</b> Immediate.
<b>CG:</b> I forgot it one day?
<b>DR:</b> It happens that next day.
<b>PT:</b> Does it?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, absolutely, I've seen that at least five times, people miss their Lamictal, they crash.  Lamictal is a decent antidepressant and a mood stabilizer.
<b>CG:</b> And a stabilizer, that's what I thought and he said oh I don't think so because I had forgotten it other times and I said other times you were on a little bit of a higher dose and you were more stable.
<b>DR:</b> So you don't want to forget the Lamictal.  I want to add another mood stabilizer from a different class.  It's indicated for bipolar but the class of medicine is actually an antipsychotic, it's, you know, it was originally for <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span>.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Now it's become a very good medicine for mood stability and especially for depression and also I have one guy on it who does jaw clenching and he, we took him off it once for whatever reason and he started jaw clenching again and then we put him back on it and he stopped.  It was a beautiful cure of his clenching. So I wonder, yeah, I mean that's what I'm thinking, I'm wondering if maybe it'll help, because your neck, your torticollis is related to a balance of inputs, of neurologic inputs, right, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, it's a balance of inputs that's off that, you know, sets it off and maybe this could help reestablish a better equilibrium there.  I know for this guy it was really striking because it's not, no one, you know, knows that it does that but it really seemed to work.  It clearly worked for him because we did on, off, on, off and whenever he was on, the jaw clenching went away and, you know, so anyway, the problem with this medicine, this class of medicine, there are two problems and, you know, there's a risk in this class of medicine of promoting diabetes.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, that could be a problem.
<b>DR:</b> Now we don't know enough about it at this point and at this point, and we suspect that much a longer term risk and it may be related to weight.
<b>PT:</b> And the reason why that bothers me is because my grandmother had diabetes, she ended up dying of a stroke. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, we know that we definitely don't want you to have diabetes and we'll definitely follow your blood sugars and make sure you don't get it but at this point, we've got to balance our short term issues and long term issues.
<b>CG:</b> We'll take the risk benefit.  I have a monitor at home.
<b>DR:</b> At least short term we will.
<b>CG:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And so for the next three to six months to a year, who cares, let's just get your brain in the right zone and then we'll worry about the rest of it.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> We'll get this calmed down.
<b>CG:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And the other issue, there's potentially long term movement problems, not something that we worry about much with this medicine.
<b>PT:</b> Like what kind of movement.
<b>DR:</b> Well the older class of antipsychotics, people would get something called tardive dyskinesia where they would move their mouth.  This was after long exposure, you know, twenty to thirty years.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And we've seen people like that, you know, schizophrenics frequently get it.
<b>CG:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And they would be exposed to these types of medicines at decent doses for decades.  We don't think that's going to be a big issue.
<b>CG:</b> Plus they'd also be on other things.
<b>DR:</b> That's right but, no, but we're pretty sure that -
<b>CG:</b> That was the one that caused it.
<b>DR:</b> These types of medicines, so we don't use it for nothing, we don't use it if you don't need it.  My sense of you is that you need it at this point, you know, that we need bigger guns to rope in your mood disorder, you're really not in a good place.  I'm duty bound to warn you about these things, I don't think they're a big deal.
<b>PT:</b> No, I understand.
<b>DR:</b> And I really, if I think these issues were more than one or two percent, I wouldn't prescribe these medicines, these are very minor low issues, at least for short term treatments.  The bigger issue is for longer term treatments and so certainly after a few months, if you're doing well, we'll try to pull you off it and switch you to something different or get you off it fully, okay?
<b>PT:</b> But that's the route I have to go?
<b>DR:</b> At this point, we need, we've kind of maxed out on these classes of medicine, you know, we've given you good strong antidepressants, we've given you decent anticonvulsants, we're really missing this other class of medicine for someone with such a dysregulated mood problem that we really are duty bound to try this class of medicine.  Have you heard of Zyprexa?  It's like Zyprexa.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Have you heard of Zyprexa?
<b>PT:</b> I've never heard of it.
<b>DR:</b> It's, you know, they started out for schizophrenics, for psychotic people, and then it became clear that they work very nicely for people with mood disorders.  All right, so -
<b>PT:</b> Does that help with like if I get agitated?
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Or if I get mouthy?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, because that's been a problem.
<b>DR:</b> In fact it can be magic for those things sometimes.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm still able to do my little project?
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so number one, first we have to get you off the Vivactil on to the Nortriptyline, so Vivactil 10 mg starting tomorrow and 10 mg, let's say times one week then stop.  Two is, Nortriptyline 25 mg times one week, 50 mg times three days, so do that at night, it's sedating, it'll help you sleep.
<b>CG:</b> And that starts tomorrow also?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Number three, stop Wellbutrin.  Four is begin this drug called Abilify.  Let me see if I have some samples.  And I also would like to go back to an antianxiety medicine; I think you really need it.  
<b>CG:</b> What are you upset about that you can't even say?  It's just this whole thing about being sick?
<b>PT:</b> It feels like it's snowballing.
<b>CG:</b> But the good news is that [PHYSICIAN NAME] knows what's going on and has the ability to help you rectify that, right?
<b>PT:</b> Well, it's hard -
<b>DR:</b> It's hard for him to take comfort when he's in such a state like this but we'll get you out of it, we'll get you out of it.  All right, 50 mg times three days.
<b>CG:</b> So Abilify is the one that could increase the blood sugar?
<b>DR:</b> Do you have a good prescription plan?
<b>PT:</b> It's not bad, you know better.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, we seem pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Just a copay because this stuff is really pricey?
<b>CG:</b> Abilify?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Is it more than Botox?
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> I get Botox every quarter.
<b>DR:</b> If you have coverage, it's okay.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, yeah, we have coverage, we have coverage. 
<b>DR:</b> I'm bringing you up slowly and then do you use Klonopin at all or just Xanax and Ativan?
<b>PT:</b> Xanax, well whatever that's called, Lorazepam.
<b>DR:</b> That's Ativan.
<b>CG:</b> That you were taking because I had that from -
<b>PT:</b> Well that's the prescription I was getting too, Lorazepam.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, no, I was giving him that.
<b>CG:</b> Oh, oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> I think he needs to get back on that, at least until you're feeling better.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So use that as needed, okay.
<b>CG:</b> 0.25 or 0.5?
<b>DR:</b> 0.5.
<b>CG:</b> 0.5.
<b>DR:</b> Do you use any of the Provigil?
<b>PT:</b> Provigil?
<b>CG:</b> No, we never did, we, you know, that was one that gave you a caffeine zap.
<b>PT:</b> Oh that, yeah.  I only used the one sample and I think you had told us that -
<b>CG:</b> It probably wasn't covered.
<b>PT:</b> That would be an insurance problem.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, he'll caffeinated himself.
<b>DR:</b> All right and continue the Lamictal.
<b>CG:</b> At what dose?
<b>DR:</b> 200.
<b>CG:</b> 200, that's what you're doing right now, right [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Tell me if that's clear to you.
<b>PT:</b> I don't have my glasses.  
<b>DR:</b> Let me see, I may have samples.  
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> And you know, it's going to help you more than it did.
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't have to be exact.
<b>NR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] the pharmacist [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I'm aware of the interaction, they need to talk to.
<b>NR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right, I said 2 mg blah, blah, blah, because I thought I was going to give you a lot of 2's.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But what I'm actually doing to do is give you a week of 2's, right, so you have three days of the 2 and then after that.
<b>CG:</b> I'll double the 2?
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>CG:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> I'm giving you some 5's.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So instead of the 4, you'll use 5 for those days, right, and then so this once can be 5, this one can be 7, right, because you have a 5 and a 2.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then skip the 8, then it'll be 10 mg and then here are the 10's.
<b>CG:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.  So the dose we're winding up on is 10?
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.  What' the time of day to take that?
<b>DR:</b> Night, night is fine so if there are any side effects you just sleep.  So here are the 5's.
<b>CG:</b> Okay, all right.
<b>DR:</b> Vivactil is off.
<b>CG:</b> What we will wind up with is 100 on the Nortriptyline, 10 on the Abilify and 200 on the Lamictal?
<b>DR:</b> Correct.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Nortriptyline comes in 25's.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Which I'm giving you.  Do you need other prescriptions?
<b>CG:</b> You know what, maybe give us one for the Lamictal, I'm not really sure.
