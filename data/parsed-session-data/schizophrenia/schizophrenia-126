<b>W</b>alking away from Gerry Hinkle, I felt like a ghost. On
campus when I shouldn't be, roaming there until I was set free,
my past resolved. Except it was Tim's past I was trying to resolve, his
past I was trying to make give up its secrets. But maybe I was getting
close; Tim had called his old professor. Another breadcrumb on the
trail, I thought, as I was almost bowled over by a giant tractor tire—
then another, and another—being rolled across my path.


A giant breadcrumb.


The giant tires of the Sig Tau Tire Roll.


I remember Porky talking about that rite of passage, the thing that
separated the Sig Tau men—Porky's fraternity, then Tim's—from the
rest of us, long before we started school there. Each frat had its own
activity; the Betas did something with bricks, another group did

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My friends and I laughed at them, although we reverently moved
to the fringes to let the festivities pass us by.


We made fun but still moved aside to let them pass us by.


Tim's Tire Roll was one of the strongest memories I have, even
though I wasn't there to witness it.


Can you have memories of things you didn't see?


I do.


This is what I saw, in my mind, from Tim's Tire Roll:


As the tires (six, seven feet in diameter, at least) were rolled by the
pledge class deep into a forest, senior members of the frat egged on
the pledges and jeered at their lack of strength and stamina. Girlfriends
dotted the route with water and wet towels. Somebody
started a chorus of "Ninety-nine Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
Harvey Wallbangers, the "theme drink" Tim's pledge year, were
mixed and passed out in the hot sun.


It was all in fun, all that sweaty, dear love of comrades. Except that
laughing and joking and sweating and swearing and drinking turned
to silence and pain, at least for Tim. The boys—for they <i>were</i> boys,
not men, no matter what anyone said, or what they themselves
wanted to believe—crossed a bridge, the final one of many on their
journey. (And I'm not just being metaphoric: they crossed a bridge,
a real one, made of brick and stone and concrete.) To celebrate, the

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Rob, a swimmer, and one of the actives mixing drinks, also
wanted to splash in the water. (Rob: handsome, chlorine-blond,
watery-eyed, even when he was away from the pool.) He wanted to
prove to someone—Tim?—what a stud he was. He dove off the
bridge, not seeing that the water wasn't deep enough for a graceful
entrance, or exit. He didn't <i>see</i>, period.


They thought his back and neck were broken.


I wondered how he kept from drowning, if he felt pain, what final
thoughts flashed through his mind. Did he think he was going to
drown, this man/boy who had spent most of his life in the water?
And what thoughts came to the other frat boys: should they call an
emergency meeting to decide what story to tell the authorities, each
boy wrestling with his conscience about how to tell it? Was there just
one story to tell, or many? Mark Schumann always recorded the Tire
Roll; did he have film of the accident, like the Zapruder film? Was it
like <i>A Separate Peace</i>, was there a Gene to shake his unspoken love
Phineas off a tree limb and headfirst into the shallow water? Would
a tribunal be called? Would the boys go off to war and come back
shell-shocked, only then ready to tell the real story?


Would someone die at the end of the book?


No, none of those things would or did happen. This wasn't <i>A Separate
Peace</i>, but something far more real and disappointing; more bad
luck around water and the Powers twins. A boy, clowning around for
attention, clowning around to attract a loved one, jumped off a
bridge.


Rob was lucky. In reality, he just broke his ankle and compressed
two lower vertebrae. After time in a hospital and at home, he was

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I remember Tim saying, with the concern you only hear in a
lover's voice, that Rob was going to hurt himself because he had
come back too early.


I remember seeing them from afar: Tim teaching Rob to walk
again, supporting his back as Rob inched forward on a cane. I saw
them from the expanse of lawn in front of Luckett Hall, the yellow
stucco monolith Tim lived in his first two years at school. I stood back
and kept quiet; I somehow knew this was a special meeting, a first, or
maybe last time, for them to talk and explore, and me not to intrude.


How quickly they moved, for two people who were learning to
walk anew.


Not long ago, I had my own late-night, drunken phone call with
Rob, out of the blue, to finally ask that same question that had
obsessed me all those years ago: Did you fuck my brother? (Too
many drinks, too many memories, too much sadness, and directory
assistance—a lethal combination, if you haven't figured that out by
now.) I asked it a little more politely than that, but that was the
bottom line, after some warm-up that was equally weird.


"Uh... I'm trying to reach Rob."


"This is he."


Now what? Did you fuck my brother and leave town? Is that what
made him go nuts?


"Rob, I don't know if you remember me," I began but stopped.
How many conversations would I start this way before I found my
brother?

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"It's Kim Powers, from AC. Tim's brother."


"Jesus.Wow. Uh...how are you?" His tone switched from excited
to guarded, as if it had suddenly hit him why would he be getting a
call from someone he had last seen nearly ten years earlier, and barely
knew then.


"This is gonna sound weird, I know, but...could you have made
the Olympics?"


"What?"


"That's what Tim always thought, if you hadn't hurt your back.
That's what he was so proud of, that he knew someone who might
have made the Olympics." What I didn't say, what broke my heart:
that he wasn't proud of himself, and had to take pride in other
people.


"God. I don't know... I mean, sure, it was my fantasy, it's everybody
's fantasy, I probably lied and said I could, but... I knew I
couldn't. I wasn't fast enough."


Now he was lost to the past, as I was most of the time; I could
hear it in his voice.


He was swimming again.


"I didn't want it enough. I was too lazy. I don't know what I
wanted." I could almost hear him shake his head to knock the
memory away, knock the water out of his ears. "I'm on a swim team
here, a gay swim team."


"Is your back okay?"


"It's fine, but that's not what kept me from the Olympics. I never
could have gotten there, with or without jumping off a bridge."


"When you fell...."


"I jumped. Period. I was drunk. I was showing off. Water and
drinking, it doesn't mix. Take my word for it."


"Were you showing off for Tim?"

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Tim? No... Lee Ridge. Remember him? That diver? He was
always saying divers were better than swimmers."


I heard him move the phone away, talk to someone else.


"I'm married. To a man. Charley. Did I tell you that?"


"Oh, God, no. I mean, congratulations."


"Everybody's flipping out. Two guys don't get married in
Michigan every day. Two <i>schoolteachers</i>."


"My mom was a schoolteacher." Where did that come from? It
was the only thing I could think to say.


Until this, my A-bomb:


"Are you in touch with Tim?"


"I haven't even talked to him since school. I wrote him once or
twice, but he never...."


"Did you ever have sex with him?"


<i>Jesus,</i> Kim.


"Jesus." That's what Rob said, too.


"I'm sorry, I can't believe I just said that."


He should've hung up on me—<i>I</i> would've hung up on me—
but he answered anyway. "We sort of rubbed each other's
crotches. I came. I don't know if he did. We never talked about
it." There was a pause. "Now <i>I'm</i> the one who can't believe I said
that."


We talked about it, we talked about other Sig Tau men who were
gay, or at least had sex with other Sig Tau men.


I got angry that they were all doing each other, and I was the only
stupid fag on campus who was bearing the cross of actually <i>saying</i> I
did it.

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What was I supposed to do now?


Call everybody Tim had ever known?


Ask all of them if they had had sex with Tim, if that's what made
him go nuts?


Only to find out he was nothing special to all of them, just like
he had been nothing special to Gerry Hinkle, who hadn't kept his
papers, or Rob, who hadn't even been showing off for Tim, but
someone else?


Maybe I should call Rob again.


"Hey, is my brother there? Starting what he never finished?"


Another giant tire almost ran me down, shaking me out of my
reverie. A quick "Sorry" from one of the SigTau boys and a giggle—
old guy, get out of the way—and they were gone.


They were gone, and so was my brother, and so was I, lost to the
past as I stood on the sidewalk like a bump on a log, trying to figure
out what to do next.


I might as well climb to the top of the Student Union Building
(the SUB) and yell "Olly olly oxen free" through a bullhorn at the
top of my lungs, see if that smoked Tim out.


My phone calls weren't working.


My talking to old teachers wasn't working.


The top of the building....


That might work.


That's where the Sig Tau "archives" was, one of a row of closets all
the Greek societies had on the second floor, for storing their archives.


Archives.


More like beer cans.


Kegs.


Maybe Tim was there, hiding out, reliving the past, like I was.


I went up two flights of stairs, past the row of doors with their

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thank God for decals.


I saw one of an armadillo on one of the doors and knew I had
found the right place.


The armadillo, the unofficial Sig Tau mascot, the icon of Texas
roadkill.


The door wasn't even locked.


It was a closet full of rickety metal shelves crammed with black
binders and boxes, poster board cutouts and felt banners, like something
from Vacation Bible School.


Those binders, the minutes of their meetings over the years. Tim
had been corresponding secretary for the frat, the keeper of their
weekly newsletter. I fingered my way across a helter-skelter row of
black binders to the one that had his year labeled on the outside and
opened it, to be engulfed by his trademark doodles, the odd little
caricatures he began drawing in high school for special friends, the
familiar bluish/purple ink on sheets of Ditto paper he wrote on in
longhand, never typed.


Those papers, my madeleine.


It was like I could smell him.


He had been here, in a way.


I flipped through the newsletters, familiar names going in and out
of sight....


"Sir?"


I whirled around.


A security guard.


<i>"Sir?"</i>


He couldn't be talking to me; I was only twenty-eight years old.


"Sir?"

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He <i>was</i> talking to me.


"Can I see your I.D.?"


"Uh, oh... I used to be a student here...in Sig Tau.... I was
just looking at some old stuff...."


I wasn't a Sig Tau, but he didn't have to know that.


"I'm sorry. Campus security and all. We've had some break-ins."


"Sorry...the door was open. You know...old times."


I should have asked him if he had seen another stranger wandering
around, someone who looked almost just like me, but I
didn't.


He ushered me out of the room and closed the door, barring it in
case I changed my mind. I walked away and made it outside, where
I sat on a stone bench that circled an old tree.


Make a plan.


Keep from going more crazy.


Find Tim.


That was a plan.


What had made Tim go crazy, when he was here, at this very same
place? The frat, all those guys piled in together; that was part of what
made him go crazy, the Homecoming carnival and its ghosts, its red
and gold balloons.


The frat made him go crazy, the Big Boys on Campus with whom
he was probably falling in love, but not admitting it, under the guise
of hazings and keg parties and cookouts on the beach.


Maybe Tim couldn't face that, not yet.


When Tim finally did quit the frat—"commit Greek suicide," as
he jokingly called it—he signed off the final set of minutes he wrote
as recording secretary with the name The Ghost of Young Tim.


Our junior year, that's what he had started becoming to me, as he
began disappearing bit by bit: the Ghost of Young Tim.

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I sat on that stone bench outside the SUB, I forced myself to
stay focused on our junior year, after he quit the frat; the year when
everything changed, when the events, good and bad, that primed the
breakdown were to take place. It was a year that could be traced from
love to love, threat to threat, despair to despair.


That year, a girl fell in love with Tim, and another boy tried to kill
himself because of it.


Another boy fell in love with me and then tried to kill me when
I said I didn't love him back.


Our best friend was raped.


And Tim and I would separate yet again, without him even
knowing it.


I was lost to the spell of it, then and now...autumn, this place,
Tim's spirit. I <i>felt</i> it. I felt <i>him</i>. He was <i>here</i>. Things were taking on
their own momentum, and my body raced forward, as much as my
mind. The smallest twitch of thought...where is he? where would
he go next?...and my feet followed, taking me from the flagstone
bench where I sat to the large auditorium of Ida Green, the theater
building, where we had spent so much of our time.


I flung open the door to the theatre....


...it banged into the wall behind it...


...and a high-pitched voice exploded on stage, at exactly the
same time.


"We've had this date from the beginning!"


Stanley and Blanche were going at it.


Stanley—all 118 pounds of him in Stanley's requisite red silk
pajamas, with the hint of a milk mustache left over from lunch—was
shaking a Valkyrie Blanche, six feet tall if she was an inch. And
strangely unmoving. Literally. She was stiff as a board, unbending as
he shook her, and then I saw she <i>was</i> a board, or almost. A mannequin.

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He was using a dressmaker's mannequin from the costume shop as
his scene partner.


"Oh, God...sorry... I was just... I didn't mean to interrupt."


"Please. Interrupt," said the Stanley. "I was just practicing. In
acting class they say I have to work on ‘owning the stage.’"


"They used to say that to me, too."


I smiled at him.


He smiled back.


It was our secret.


"But between us, I don't think anything's gonna make this scene
work. Maybe I need a real girl. I guess that's what Tennessee Williams
meant."


"I'm not so sure."


We smiled again. This kid was smarter than I had been back then.


I made my way down the black linoleum steps of the auditorium,
past the orange seats to the stage, where I had spent so many lonely,
obsessed Saturday afternoons myself, practicing when the rest of the
campus was off watching a football game. How desperate I had been
to be in <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i> my sophomore year, thinking me
as Stanley was the perfect way to deconstruct that old chestnut. You
want hunky Marlon Brando in a tight T-shirt? Try a skinny geek
instead, who can't see without his glasses, and see the play anew. Fortunately,
no one agreed with me. I ran the light board instead, a likely
fate for my new friend Stanley, on stage now. He could have been
me, almost a decade earlier: skinny, geeky, glasses-wearing, desperate
to impress any older alumni who might come wandering through.
Desperate for sex, if only someone would make the offer, or take
him up on it.


Maybe I was just thinking about me.


I might not have starred in <i>Streetcar</i> all those years ago, but I finally

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I used to think I did.


I played Rosencrantz, on stage for nearly the whole play; Tim played
Osric, who came on only in the last few minutes, to clean up the
mess. ("That's what makes this one a tragedy," he would later write.)
Until then, Tim held court in the greenroom a flight below the
stage, dabbling in theater but never really serious about it, making
the best friends of his life. The friends who would soon make him
go crazy. Carrie, whom he nicknamed Toujours, an <i>homage</i> to the
French classes we struggled through, was Ophelia, lounging in a
padded vinyl chair, her heavy black Elizabethan gown incongruous
against her flirtations and cigarettes. Roy Simmons, Tim's new best
friend now that Rob was at home, recuperating from his jump off
the bridge, was a spear carrier and shared Carrie with Tim; they were
the <i>Jules et Jim</i> of Elsinore.


Tim fell in love with Carrie, as she would later, I think, with him.


Selmore Haines, my black boyfriend, was the Player King; Kent
Johnson, the department's star, was a brilliant Hamlet (angry that he
didn't get a lead, but the only actor haunting enough to pull off the
relatively small part of Hamlet).


Michael Ditmore, a fat, bearded English major, played Polonius
and also fell in love with Carrie.


He wrote a much-publicized poem about her betrayal of him

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Peyton Place, while I was acting my guts out a floor above, completely
unaware, and having the best time of my life.


In my gold velvet costume, just like the golden leaves outside.


Michael Ditmore's poem, "The History of Suicide," told the exact
time and place at which he tried to buy a gun to kill himself, only to
be saved by the "much talked about Kent Johnson." Yes, ma'am, real
names and everything. (Same thing for me. It happened; fuck 'em, let
'em come after me. I've got the truth, and a missing brother, on my
side. What do they have, besides some adolescent hurt feelings?)
Michael wrote of Carrie and Tim, "But she has no idea yet that he is
homosexual.... I would say her name out loud but for libel laws."


The show continued; few of us knew of the suicide attempt until
the poem came out in the campus literary magazine that spring.
Carrie's friends refused to let her read it, as if protecting her from a
bad review. Ironically, a prose piece Tim wrote about first love was in
that same issue, as well as a poem from the boy whose offer of love
I refused. God, we were a literary bunch; if we couldn't kill ourselves
or someone else, we'd just write about it.


After the play's Friday night opening, I laid my head on a long
makeup table, too exhausted to move. I had literally given all I had
to give, as clichéd and college-melodramatic as that sounds; my
autumn-gold costume was soaked through with sweat, the velvet wet
to the touch. I radiated heat. I had to focus myself like a drunk, like
I had seen my father do on so many occasions, close my eyes
between each thought, each breath, just to get to the next one.
"Okay. Come on now. You can do it. Atta boy."


I finally pulled myself together and went to the cast party at Dub's
house, a crumbling old Victorian just off-campus. Selmore and I

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later that night, still unaware of Michael Ditmore's dark night of
the soul, Selmore and I, Tim, Roy, and Gil, who would later become
Tim's first lover, left the party and wound our way to our dorms. In
my mind, we were like the celebrants in <i>The Seventh Seal,</i> led by a
hooded man carrying a sickle. Only he wasn't a symbol of Death,
but of Triumphant Youth. We were a silhouette, a tableau, moving
across the lawn, our tennis shoes damp with buttons of early-morning
dew.


We passed a small stucco building—the old YMCA, turned into
a teacher-training lab—that was surrounded by a fence. Electrical
poles carried heavy wires to antennas on top of the building; looped
coils of barbed wire topped the fence. I fantasized that it was some
sort of control center for the college, a power plant whose constant
electrical hum was the white noise behind our studies.


My hair bristled as I walked near it.


In my imagination, a guard was stationed inside, watching monitors
where he could zero in on suspicious activity. That night, he
zeroed in on the five of us: frozen on his screen in a reverse image,
our background dark, our expressions time-exposure silver. Tim and
Roy would photograph the most vibrantly, with their high spirits
and blond hair; their auras would center the photograph emotionally.
The guard was impressed with the silvery beauty of that image and
wished there had been moments like that for him when he was a
young man, before he put on weight and had a wife, and three kids
in diapers.


But the beauty turned ugly. The guard blew the picture up a
thousand times and saw something almost imperceptible to the human

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tim wanted to be able to recall dew on his feet, to never have
them dry; he wanted that night to last forever.


I wanted it to end, pissed off that he was drunk like our father,
pissed off that he was so clearly gay but wouldn't come out like I
had—and suffered because of it—pissed off that my feet were wet.


He loved me so much, and I treated him like shit.


He wasn't the only one.


Several months after <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,</i> a boy named
Brian fell in love with me. He'd seen my performance, had seen me
in my gold tights, and he still fell in love with me. I didn't return his
love, so he wrote a poem about it, cursing me, as Michael Ditmore
had cursed Tim.


Brian came to my fourth-floor room in Baker Hall, the first time
I had ever seen him break away from his Dean Hall premed crowd.
He was a big guy; stocky, a little straight-laced, a little bumbling. He
haltingly told me he was gay; I was the big fag on campus; I was the
first stop everybody made, when they finally figured it out about
themselves. Brian hung around me the next week or so, and one
night nervously asked me to meet him up in his lab, high above the
Moody Science Building pine trees. I went, perhaps suspecting what
was going to be said, but almost more excited about my first trip into
those hallowed halls. Just as the subterranean world of the theater
was mysterious to so many others, this world of test tubes and lab
coats was <i>terra nova</i> to me.


As far as I knew, they were cloning humans in there.


After showing me some of his work, clumsily rushing through the

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He is the only person in my life whose gift of love I did not
return.


He began rattling one of the animal cages, knocking the rat inside
to a corner. The rat's eyes widened; he was as scared as I was. For a
split second, I thought Brian was going to kill the rat, or me—stab
me with one of his medical instruments, make me drink poison,
push me off the fourth-floor balcony outside, and claim it was an
accident.


But he did none of those.


He just wrote a poem about it, without using my name, but
telling the entire campus of the exact time and place at which his
world blew apart, and how he would always hate the person who
caused it.


Me.


If I knew differently, if I thought Brian might be reading these
pages today, I would beg his forgiveness. I would say I was just as
mean to my beloved brother, so he shouldn't feel alone. But forgive-
ness isn't possible; Brian is dead, an early casualty of AIDS.


I beg his forgiveness anyway.


Had I actually said any of that aloud?


Silence from the Stanley, staring at me in shock.


That must mean I had.

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He spoke first, this stranger who didn't know me from Adam, who
made me feel like I was looking back at myself.


"Are you okay?"


"Not really. My brother's missing. I thought he might be here. A
lot of stuff happened to him here." I took a breath and plunked
myself down on the lip of the stage, the whole day finally catching
up with me. "Maybe I'm just hungry. I haven't eaten much today."


"You wanna...should I get the nurse's office or security or
something? Are you <i>okay?</i>"


He didn't know what to do.


Neither did I, except to look embarrassed.


"Come on, I think you should eat a little bit. I'll take you to
Slater's, get some food. Some iced tea with lots of sugar," the Stanley
said. "That always makes me feel better."


"Me, too."


He took his red pajama top off from over his regular school
clothes and draped it over the mannequin's torso, then led the way
out, like the doctor carting Blanche off at the end of the play. I whispered
under my breath, not sure I even meant for him to hear, her
famous last line, "I have always depended on the kindness of
strangers."


He did hear it.


"I can't believe you just said that. I love that line. It's so true. You
think anybody'd notice if I switched it to Stanley instead of
Blanche?"


It was about six P.M. by now; Slater's, the cafeteria where I had
started off my search at AC, was in full swing. The Stanley stuck two

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I love crushed ice, don't you? It's so much better for my teeth
than regular ice cubes. I've always gotta be chewing on something,
and the crushed ice is mushier."


He handed me my iced tea, then popped the top off a bottle of
baby aspirin he pulled out of his pocket.


"Hope you like orange. They re a little chalky, but I prefer 'em...
you can take up to six at a time without dying. I know. I've tried," he
said, rolling his eyes. "You just get a little...sleepy. Sometimes you
don't really need aspirin, just...the <i>idea</i> of aspirin. That's why I take
the baby ones."


I had fallen down the Rabbit Hole.


"Now we need food. You shouldn't take aspirin on an empty
stomach. Even baby ones." He continued his running commentary,
as he walked me through the cafeteria line that was still so familiar,
from seven, eight, nine, ten years ago. "It's Saturday night. That means
steak or shrimp, but you can't get both, or seconds, when they serve
nice food like that. Well, most people can't. I can. The cafeteria ladies
like me."


With that, he winked at one of them.


She winked back.


Food tray in hand, he led the way to the glass-enclosed patio
called the Loggia, off the main part of the cafeteria. I could have
predicted it: it was where I had eaten so many meals, the automatic
beeline my artsy, outsider friends and I always made to get away
from the din of the jocks and the frat boys in the main part of the
cafeteria.


Moving, cutting up his food, eating, he never stopped chattering
away. Whether he was just naturally talkative or nervous—I would

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Whatcha think about my Stanley? Don't answer, I know... I
shoulda done Blanche."


Oz.


"That was a joke."


He put on a pair of glasses, which magnified his eyes about a million
times.


"I didn't think Stanley wears glasses...the script doesn't say, it just
says the red pj's...so I couldn't see when I was doing the scene.
Could you tell?"


Never-Never Land.


"Would you mind doing something, even if it sounds kinda
weird?"


"Weird hasn't really been a problem for me today."


"Could you call me Stanley? I wanna see if it helps me find my
character. I need all the help I can get."


"Let's make it Stan. You just need a little help."

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I love Saturday nights. There's so much...magic to do. You know
that song? From <i>Pippin?</i> I auditioned with it once. I shoulda sung the
grandma's song instead. I was flat the whole time. Dub had me do
props instead. I'm big on props."


Stan shoveled down a steak, covered with A-1 sauce; I had the
fried shrimp. That, or the baby aspirin with an iced-tea chaser had
helped; I was feeling better, even if I was no closer to finding Tim.
It had been about eighteen hours since I'd first gotten the call yesterday
morning that he was missing, eight hours or so today since I'd
flown from New York to Texas. Since I'd been here, I'd called home
at least half a dozen times to check for messages from Tim; there
were none. I'd called his apartment just as often, holding my breath
for a pickup, but none came.


Finally, I had called Jess, still out of town, and confessed my insane
notion that Tim might be at Austin College and oh, by the way, so
was I. Jess hung up, more furious at me than scared for Tim.


At least a hang-up was better than nothing at all.


I stared at Stan, lost in his youth, his innocence, his need to
impress, even with silliness. He was better looking than I'd thought
at first; his face was fuller, set off by a red flush on his cheeks that
hadn't diminished. At first, I'd thought it was adrenaline from the
<i>Streetcar</i> scene; it wasn't,just the adrenaline of being twenty years old.
Don't grow up, I wanted to warn him; there are only hang-ups on
the phone and pissed-off boyfriends and missing people in the "real
world," on the other side of college. Saturday nights, yeah, they're
great, "magic to do" and all...but there's always the Sunday
morning after. The morning after....


"What?" he asked.

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Nothing."


"No, what? You're thinking how weird this is, right, you just meet
this kid and now you're eating with him. It's okay, you can leave, I
didn't mean to..."


"No, I was thinking how this is the exact same table I was sitting
at when I found out my best friend was raped. Back when we were
all your age."


Now he was the one who stared.


"Tim being gone...going nuts... I think it has something to do
with that. She was in plays, too."


On that particular Sunday morning, our friend Sarah came to
brunch late. She bypassed our usual table in the Loggia to sit with a
group of girls from her dorm. Not the fun girls, as she was, but the
tough ones, the ones who abided by the rules and told on people,
the ones we suspected were lesbians. It was as if they were her honor
guard, preceding her in a V-shaped motorcade, protecting her.


She set her tray down, then came over to Tim.


"I need to talk to you after lunch. <i>Real bad</i>." (Not "really bad," not
"really badly," but "real bad." How I will never forget those words,
never forget the searching in her large, liquid eyes as she said them,
as long as I live.) Tim asked if something was wrong. She just
repeated, with eyes that were already round and now got rounder,
"I just <i>really</i> need to talk to you."


Several girls, in the past, have asked Tim to save them, to be with
them. He could barely save himself, but they didn't know that: he
was sensitive, he was certainly more fun than most of the redneck
boys they dated, and he wasn't a threat, sexually, even though I think

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This time, it was too late for Tim to save Sarah.


The call never even came.


That Sunday morning, in the cafeteria, she said she was going to
one of the music rooms to play piano and sing with Casey. I was
included in the glance, but not the invitation.


Sarah, who'd spent that first, inaugural summer with Tim at Mo
Ranch, was short. She had an oval face framed by a fashionable, short
haircut, freckles, and expressive, bottomless eyes. She introduced us
to so many things: Reuben sandwiches, homeopathy, decency. Early
on, when our nosy friend David kept bugging her about what her
parents "did," she yelled at him, "My father died when I was two. He
doesn't <i>do</i> anything. He <i>isn't</i>." She told us about her mother and
aunt, who lived in the same town but hadn't spoken in years. I once
spent a Saturday night in the student lounge rubbing her forearm, as
she told me how much she enjoyed <i>feeling</i>, what a tactile person she
was. When the curly-headed David went through his trauma about
my gayness and we "divided up the property" of our shared dorm
room, she came over for a date with him but seemed more interested
in helping me and Selmore settle into a quiet Saturday night.

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I loved her.


So did Tim.


After brunch, he went off to find her, and I went off into my day,
this Sunday "morning after" that I somehow knew was shaky around
the edges.


That night at dinner, our little band gathered again in the glass-enclosed
Loggia, the second table in from the door. The Loggia held
about twenty tables and was implicitly reserved for the fringe, the
artists and outsiders of the school, like us. From it—although this
isn't why we sat there—you could view a particular Austin College
tradition: frat boys being pulled out, through an adjoining glass
hallway, and thrown into an outdoor fountain on their birthdays.


Happy birthday—wet, like you came into the world.


I was always afraid the stunt would get out of hand, that one of
them would cut himself to shreds, falling into a plateglass door, or
wall of glass.


I was always afraid of how much blood I might have to witness,
sitting there.


On this particular Sunday, a frat boy had a birthday. He was chased
through the Loggia, whose narrow passageway was already jammed
with books and backpacks. Games of chase don't get more sophisticated
as you get older, they get simpler: just run and catch. But the
running becomes clumsier, for even the most athletic twenty-year-old
is no match for that same child, ethereal and weightless, at seven.


The running got clumsy that night.


After tolerating several of the frat boys running through the
Loggia, I picked up my tray and slammed it back down on the table.
The moment was unpremeditated; the tray became an extension of
the nerve synapses that clicked my arms into action, the arm that had
been broken and mended in the fourth grade, that I was always afraid

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They were wrong.


I was standing up to run away from a secret.


Tim had released it, as the Sphinx did before crumbling, just
moments before I threw my fit.


He had just told us, "Sarah was raped last night."


Tim's best friend had been destroyed.


<i>That</i> was the moment of his breakdown; only the need to see the
look in my eyes when he told us, to pass some sort of challenge on
to me, kept him from going home right then and there, instead of
months later.


I couldn't accept what I had just been told. I could only yell at
everyone, and know, as they did, that they were the wrong people to
yell at, that the right person to yell at would never be caught, that
the only release was hysteria and running away.


I ran into the Music and Art Building, home to the muses, across
the promenade from the Loggia.


Maybe I ran there because I remembered Sarah saying she was
going to play piano and sing with Casey. Maybe I needed man's
impulse toward something higher, like art, at that moment. Maybe I
needed to be alone, away from frat boys, away from the possibility of
broken glass, away from rapists. I needed the solitude of that

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tom Luck was on the first floor, getting a drink from a water
fountain. He was the leader of the flock, the spiritual guide to Tim's
fraternity. He wanted to become a priest, as they all did, but was the
only one of those guilt-motivated Presbyterians and Episcopalians
who actually did it. He succored me, even then.


I said, "Something horrible has happened."


He said, "I know."


I must have said the words "Sarah" and "rape," but I don't
remember. Tom took over, and I let go. I told him everything
through my salty tears: I cried for the anguish I knew Tim felt, and
I cried for Sarah and the very specific terror she must have felt (a
terror I have never come close to feeling, even now).


Shelly Tappa, ethereal hippie daughter of Dick Tappa, campus
music teacher and band leader (an'-a-one-an'-a-two) came out of
the bathroom by the water fountain; she knew about music, and
pain. She might not have known what happened—she didn't know
me—but she hugged me anyway, brushing the hair off my face and
soothing my brow. We never did introduce ourselves, although we
shared embarrassed smiles after that. (Days later, I dreamed that I
married her on a wonderful old train going through the Swiss Alps.
I was strong and manly; we were embarking on a wonderful life
together, blessed by her father, who led the band at our wedding, in
love with our youth. I swore to her every fidelity, every hope.) She
and Tom gave me the courage to go on, as I exhausted my tears and
went up to Sarah.


She and Casey had been playing piano and singing upstairs; I must
have heard them. I have often wondered, in the years since, if they
heard me downstairs; they didn't seem surprised when I came in.

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We were all very quiet.


Somewhere, maybe then, maybe later, I heard the few details: a
black man had come in through her unlocked door and told her he
would kill her if she made any noise. She wasn't wearing her contacts
and couldn't see him. He left behind a footprint in the flower
bed outside her window.


Sarah recovered, although she's never returned to campus in the
many years since she graduated. I have wondered, at times, if her
husband holds her with the thought that nothing will ever hurt her
again; I hope he holds her with all the love he can, as I did that
Sunday evening.


Whenever I started missing the "old" Sarah, I realized it was really
Tim, the Tim who had always been safe, whose friends didn't get
raped, that I missed most of all. I cry for his pain and do everything
I can to keep from running back to the Music and Art Building, even
though it wouldn't do any good. Art and music, I believe, are gifts of
the gods, but the gods are gone right now. Their songs and their
paintings are creations I cannot understand, while my brother is still
missing.


Jesus wept.


So did I.


Could you blame us?

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You need some more aspirin. Maybe the real stuff this time. And
some more iced tea. That'll do the trick."


My new, old friend Stan to the rescue yet again, making me laugh
with his blunt simplicity. With his belief that problems could be
fixed, with something as simple as a beverage, when I knew they
couldn't.


"If I have anymore I'll float away."


"Then let's go for a swim. That's what I do to clear my head.
C'mon."


"Right after you eat? Is that safe?"


"Hasn't hurt me yet. I do it all the time. Plus if I stay here, I'll keep
eating. I'm getting fat. Don't think <i>that'll</i> work for Stanley. Get me
<i>away</i> from the desserts."


He weighed 118 pounds, soaking wet.


With shoes on.


Heavy shoes.


I shoveled a last fried shrimp into my mouth and let myself be led
away, once again.


Being led away was easier than thinking. I was tired of thinking,
of doing, of remembering. I wanted somebody else to take over, and
right now, the Stanley was the only candidate. ("Are ye able?" said
the Master. "Yes," said Stan, at the same time I said "No.")


Outside, it was already dark, about seven o'clock on a cool fall
night. We approached the '60s-looking "nautatorium," where Stan
took me toward the locker rooms, the smell of chlorine guiding
our way.


We were getting closer to swimming.


Maybe we were getting closer to Tim.

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the days that followed Sarah's rape, Tim and I, unbeknownst to
each other, both went to John Ruff, head of campus security, to
express our outrage. Tim blamed "them" for the rape, asked if they
had even thought of calling Sarah's mother, to offer a lame apology
or some sort of restitution. They jumped on his suggestion as if it
would erase everything that had happened. I just yelled; John Ruff
defended and explained. The only officer on duty that night had
been a fat, goofy kid, a Keystone Kop; he couldn't have done anything,
anyway.


I was, once again, a missile without a target.


Tim made an appointment to see Howard Starr, the dean of
students—a weasly man, I thought, capable of tapping phones,
despite his well-cut suits and gold bracelets. In my fevered brain, he
was the secret police. Years later, Tim told me about his meeting with
Howard; I forgot whatever he told me, preferring my own version
of the scene, although I don't think I was far off. In front of Howard's
massive, marbled desk, polished daily to a high gloss sheen by his
slavish secretary, Tim sits in a high-backed green leather chair, its
worn leather tacked down by brass studs that are imprinted with
whorls of black gold. Tim nervously picks at the studs and gets a
chewed-off, bloody fingernail underneath one of them, one that
another troublemaker had already managed to pry up. Tim joins that
legacy of troublemakers, of rabble-rousers.


It's fun to imagine that Tim told Howard Starr to go fuck himself,
but I think it's just that, imagination. I think, instead, Tim was
put in the place Howard wanted him in, shaking and bleeding in a
leather chair. It was but a short walk from there to his second-floor
dorm room, a floor down from mine in Baker Hall, from which Tim
looked out and saw the school for what it was, and started screaming
for our father to come rescue him.

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Stan tossed a baggy pair of blue checked swim trunks at me.


"Here. Wear these. They were my dad's."


At his locker, Stan had pulled out two bathing suits: a little red
Speedo, still damp from other swims, and a baggier pair of trunks.


"Sometimes I wear 'em. It connects me, ya know? You need connection.
I think maybe if I swim a mile in his trunks, it'll help me
like him more."


Maybe all fathers wore the same pair, because they were remarkably
like the baggy swim trunks my own father had worn, that I had
absconded with on a trip back home, in my "shabby chic" period. I
had gone through a period in college of taking a bunch of his old
clothes, from the '40s camel's hair coat he had, to a pale orange
jumpsuit he wore when he went hunting. I didn't think the clothes
would help me like him more; I just thought they would make me
look more "bohemian."


Stan discreetly stepped behind a locker to shimmy out of his
clothes and into his Speedo. I had the feeling he stepped behind the
locker even when he was by himself, to shield his own eyes from his
naked body.


I stuck the knapsack of Tim's letters that I had been carrying
around in his locker and got rid of the bathing suit as well. How
could I tell Stan I had barely been swimming since the first grade,
that summer of swimming lessons that ended in a car wreck? That I
was afraid all swimming would end in a car wreck, or a broken arm,
or a broken leg? How could I tell him a grown man was afraid of
the water, because of what happened to him as a kid? Maybe I could
pretend a dip in the pool was the shower I hadn't taken this
morning, and that would pave the way out of my fear. I wasn't afraid

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Stan stepped out from his changing space and reached in his
locker for a snorkeling mask, the kind that stuck a few inches out
from your face. "Gotta wear these over my glasses, or I'll knock
myself out on the walls. I did once. They had to fish me out. Six
Eyes," he said, rolling just two of them at himself. "You're not
dressed."


He said it like a question.


"You take the first lap. I'll...uh, do it in a minute."


He shrugged and headed to the pool; I followed, remembering
how the soles of my feet used to prune up as I tiptoed over tiny
damp tiles that formed a red-and-gold kangaroo, the school's mascot.


Stan dipped his mask in the pool, swished the water around, then
dove, perfectly, into the pool. The water pulled down his Speedo, just
an inch or two. A flash of surprisingly shapely ass, of tight white skin.
He sliced through the water with incredible ease and power, for
someone so frail.


He was so skinny, he looked like an old man.


But he looked like a kid, too.


He looked like Oscar the Ghost, who was said to haunt the old
YMCA building on campus, that had been turned into a theater-in-the-round.
From the first time I heard the legend, I created a story
around it, that Oscar was a swimmer who could have been a little
boy or an old man. I imagined that a wood platform of a stage had
literally been built over the pool, trapping the live person who was
swimming there. The underwater lights were on, and Oscar was too
hypnotized by the beauty of his underwater world to realize what
was going on in the real world above him. Maybe he was happier

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now, it was Stan, not Oscar, who pulled up to the tiled edge of
the pool, and raised his mask to the top of his head. His glasses
underneath were all steamed up, dotted with drops of water.


"Whatcha waitin' for? Get dressed and come on in."


"Uh... I haven't really been swimming in a long time. I'm sorta
rusty. 'Sides, I can't see without my glasses."


I wasn't about to tell someone who weighed 118 pounds—119,
now that he was wet—that I was afraid of the water.


"Wear my mask. It'll come back in no time. C'mon...it feels
great...just what you need...."


He reached his skinny little hand out and touched my skin. "See,
the water's warm. Heated. It feels good."


He looked like a skeleton trying to pull me in.


"You can just float. I'll start ya easy. What are you waiting for?
<i>Come on</i>."


It's exactly what I had said to Tim, begging him to follow me out
of the womb.


<i>"NO."</i>


I yelled it and pulled back, plopping onto the hard wet tiles.


Stan finally stopped trying. "Sorry. You okay?"


"Yeah. Fine."


Fine, except for the fact that I had just freaked out when a friendly
kid tried to get me to go for a swim.


Fine, except for the fact that this kid, a complete stranger, seemed
to have a crystal ball back to my birth.

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wasn't mad at him; I was mad at Tim, for not coming out first,
as planned.


I was mad at Tim for disappearing and leaving me alone.


I stomped back to the locker room, slipping just a little bit on the
tiles. I heard skinny little Stan pull himself up after me; I could visualize
his wet footprints, like footprints from the Invisible Man, left
behind him.


"What? What did I do? I was just trying to—"


"Nothing. I...it's not you...it's just...this is bullshit. What am
I doing swimming with a kid in a red Speedo when my brother's
missing? Trying to play like I'm eighteen again? I'm hanging out in
a pool and he's somewhere probably bleeding to death. This is
insane."


Nuts.


This whole fucking thing was nuts.


"I'm sorry. I just thought...maybe you need a little R&R;, a
break from whatever—"


"Maybe you just need to shut up...and I need to get back home.
What am I doing here?"


"You're looking for your brother. It makes sense, from everything
you've said. I'll help."


"‘Help,’ right. A complete stranger. Guess that shows how many
people really wanna help."


No, Kim, it shows how many people you'll <i>let</i> help. Or won't.
You're pissing and moaning, but you won't let anybody else in. You
never have.


I yanked my knapsack of letters out of the locker.


"Here. Ya wanna help?" I tossed the knapsack at Stan. "'I present
them to you with a box of aspirin tablets.'" Those were Blanche's
words, tossed at the brute Stanley as she turned over her papers on

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

These were my papers, on the lost Tim Powers.


"Read 'em and weep. Better yet, read 'em, take two <i>baby</i> aspirin,
since you're so big on it, and call me in the morning."


He stood there, speechless, shivering in his Speedo, clutching my
knapsack, looking on in shock at this ogre who had turned on him
for no apparent reason.


And like so many fights with Tim, I wouldn't let myself be the
first to say I'm sorry. I wouldn't be the first to say it wasn't Tim, or
Stan, that I was yelling at—I was yelling at myself, for being such an
idiot. For letting life become such a mess. For getting on a plane to
Texas, when I should have stayed home. For not knowing what else
to do.


Now we were <i>both</i> missing.


"You wanna find him? Be my guest. Have at 'em."


I waved at the letters Stan now held and left.


I would not look back.


But I couldn't look anywhere else, except back to the day Tim
had his breakdown, seven years earlier, in the fall of our senior year
in college, when he'd gone swimming for the last time.


I'd avoided it long enough; there was nowhere else to turn.


Oh, yes, as Stanley would say, we've had this date from the
beginning.
