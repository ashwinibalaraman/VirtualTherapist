They said I was mad; and I said they were
mad, and, damn them, they outvoted me.

Sanity a trick of agreement.

The persons hitherto reckoned as mad, you
see, became normal last night at eleven,
accordant with Reason in its newest phase.
And more, if the matter be rightly regarded,
it's patent that, at the aforementioned hour,
the sane folks, so called, began forthwith to
rave.

<i>Peer Gynt</i>


Mental patients are rejects from home, school, work,
and society at large. Their behavior is inappropriate
or inconvenient and occasionally dangerous. When others find them
intolerable, their isolation makes them less able to resist hospitalization,
especially if they are poor, members of an ethnic minority,
physically disabled, old, or young. Louise Wilson's description of the
forced admission of her problem son, "Kicking, Screaming, and
Cursing," and Dr. Viscott's chronicle of the hospitalization of a
normal teenage boy following a family dispute, "Conspiracy against
the Weak," demonstrate the vulnerability of the young. But even the

Hospitalization shields the community from a person in the guise
of protecting him from himself: "Surely it is better that silly claptrap
or obscenities or outbursts against the people whom normally a
patient loves the most be poured out before doctors and nurses than
before neighbors," concludes mental hygienist Edith Stern. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_2994');">[note]</a><div id="_note_2994" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1Stern, 1968, p. 41.</div>According to psychologist Kent Miller, "Mental health agencies are
increasingly charged with the responsibility of dealing with irritating,
troublesome people in the community--reflecting a conflict that has
existed over time but has not been clearly recognized." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_3302');">[note]</a><div id="_note_3302" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">2Miller, 1976, p. 12.</div> Former state
mental hospital superintendent William Sheeley admits that many
inmates simply are not emotionally disturbed: "For years the
community has sent us people with little or no mental illness, but with
limited ability to compete in the world ... unreconstructible Peter
Pans ... old people ... and naughty folk." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_3671');">[note]</a><div id="_note_3671" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">3Sheeley, 1959, p. 28.</div> Psychologist Walter
Fisher's account ("Staff Has Spoken!") of the way a mental hospital
disposes of a couple who ignore community norms supports
Sheeley's viewpoint.


Surely it is a violation of civil liberties to force people into
treatment who are merely eccentric or dangerous only to <i>themselves</i>.
Unconscious people and people too gravely disabled to function or to
seek aid can and should be treated as medical emergencies in general
hospitals, unless and until they protest that they do not want help. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_4247');">[note]</a><div id="_note_4247" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">4Szasz, 1966, p. 92.</div>Individuals less severely disabled yet unable to care for themselves,
and incompetents, may be placed under guardianship after judicial
review, but they needn't be hospitalized in a mental institution. After
all, forced treatment can reinforce the very helplessness it is meant to
avoid. Mental hospital administrator Willard Larson finds that
psychiatrists in particular are "... seriously underestimating the
degree of responsibility that psychiatric patients will assume, and in

[p. <i>5</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Given the extreme case of the suicidal person, the wise course
seems to be to offer assistance in overcoming the crisis, but not to
enforce hospital dependency. If a person is determined to kill himself,
he can do so after, if not during his hospitalization, even with the
most understanding and intensive care. Ernest Hemingway, whose
hospitalization A. E. Hotchner describes in "Admission Struggle,"
committed suicide in spite of coerced treatment.


Some people who are dangerous to themselves are also unintentionally
dangerous to others, for example, people who persistently
forget to shut off their cooking. Such people can be restrained by
informal warnings or by civil proceedings that compel them to find
new lodgings, with nursing care if necessary. Similarly, heads of
households who harm family members by precipitously impoverishing
themselves can be placed under guardianship; children
are under the automatic guardianship of their parents. Civil remedies
protect the community reasonably well without entailing involuntary
hospitalization. A cautious approach is called for in these instances,
particularly since dangerousness is often exaggerated or even entirely
concocted. For instance, a San Francisco geriatric screening team
making "... home visits discovered in practically every instance....
family feuds, neighborhood feuds, one relative wanting to get rid of
another elderly relative by stating the person was dangerous and so
on...." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_6864');">[note]</a><div id="_note_6864" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">6Petris Committee, 1967, p. 23.</div>


People have learned that commitment requires evidence of
dangerousness; when they want to commit someone, they frequently
invent plausible grounds:
<blockquote>
<p>
In one case, persons representing themselves as spokesmen for an
ethnically oriented social and political action group accompanied a
patient to the admitting room of the hospital to assure her
admission to a locked ward; they contended that she had thrown
her newborn infant into a trash can on the street. Because of the
nature of her behavior, and the social pressure, the patient was
accepted for direct admission to the ICU [intensive care unit,

Bronx Psychiatric Center]. We later learned that the story was pure
fabrication. The community had defined the patient as a nuisance,
and it wanted to make sure that she stayed in the hospital. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_7892');">[note]</a><div id="_note_7892" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">7Rachlin, 1975, p. 190, bracketed

What should be done about the deliberately and criminally
dangerous, as well as the "chomosomally deficient" and other
"unintentional" offenders who try to derive benefit from their crimes,
and individuals who have fits of "insane" temper? The community
has a right to protect itself from those whose violent or threatening
behavior constitutes a clear danger. Isn't society best protected
when arsonists are not psychiatrically labeled "pyromaniac,"
but are made responsible for their acts in the criminal justice system,
with its procedural protections and due process? Psychologist Al
Siebert persuasively argues, "Calling someone ‘sick’ because of how
he acts merely excuses us from responsibility for what we do to him. It
would be more honest to say, ‘We're locking you up because we don't
like what you're doing.’ We can and should take action against
someone who has lost control of himself and is intruding into the lives
and minds of others." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_9716');">[note]</a><div id="_note_9716" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">11Siebert, 1968, p. 16.</div>


Honesty should replace the hypocrisy of the advice given in a
popular guide for attendants: "The idea that a patient is ill is a far
better reason to give him for his detention than that he is too
troublesome, dangerous, or foolish to be abroad." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_10024');">[note]</a><div id="_note_10024" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">12Arco, 1967, p. 14.</div> Seymour Krim
perceptively enlarges on this theme in "The Insanity Bit, (I)." All
too common is the position of sociologist Don Martindale, who,
together with psychiatric social worker Edith Martindale, suggest
that "... in all transitional situations borderline between mental
illness and outright criminality, the most humane response is almost
always to opt for involuntary hospitalization for treatment, rather
than to send the individual to prison. This permits the offender to

Sociologist Thomas Scheff points out the negative results of the
sickness approach: "When a residual rule-breaker organizes his
behavior within the framework of mental disorder, and when his
organization is validated by others, particularly prestigeful others
such as physicians, he is ‘hooked’ and will proceed on a career of
chronic deviance." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_11196');">[note]</a><div id="_note_11196" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">14Scheff, 1966, p. 88.</div> Further, "... hospitalization confirms for the
patient the idea that he is out of control," according to analyst John
Schimel. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_11370');">[note]</a><div id="_note_11370" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">15Benziger, 1976, p. 101.</div> In "A Sorting Problem," it is Police Sergeant Sykora who
asks the key question about hospitalizing people: "Is a law being
broken?" The law certainly allows a decided leeway for the just
prosecution of menaces and extreme nuisances, while studies indicate
that inmates and former inmates are less dangerous than people in the
population at large." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_11771');">[note]</a><div id="_note_11771" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">16Miller, 1976, pp. 59-65.</div> With its safeguards, the criminal approach to
disruptive behavior would probably lead to only a modest possible
increase in jailing and imprisonment, but to much less hospitalization,
since people not convicted of a crime would not be hospitalized.


After extensive study a legislative health committee in California
concluded: "What is required is a voluntary system for providing
prompt and appropriate assistance to citizens suffering from mental
disorders without any loss of liberty; and an involuntary system for
identifying and separating dangerous persons from the community,
with full due process of law, and providing them with such treatment
and custody as may be required." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_12526');">[note]</a><div id="_note_12526" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">17<i>Dilemma</i>, 1967, pp. 19-20.</div> Such arrangements are far from
being accomplished. Mental hospitals historically have served, and
now serve in large part, as short-stay jailhouses for noncriminals. As
early as 1839 an anonymous writer recognized that "the inmates of an
... asylum are in point of fact in a prison." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_12871');">[note]</a><div id="_note_12871" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">l8Anon., 1839, p. 16.</div> Mental hospital
psychiatrist Maurice Grimes refers to "... state hospitals and other

Some social scientists go so far as to contend, "The situation of the
hospital inmate is certainly less extreme than that of his counterpart
in a concentration camp, but the difference is neither qualitative nor
decisive." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_13429');">[note]</a><div id="_note_13429" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">21Rosenberg <i>et al.,</i> 1964, p. 162.</div> Ironically, a psychiatric nursing text defines an inmate's

The Soviet use of mental hospitals for political repression
illustrates the larger theme that people in conflict, people who don't
like or can't control each other, turn to the mental hospital. The
practice has been widespread. The Nazis, for instance, sent political
opponents to mental hospitals, <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_14714');">[note]</a><div id="_note_14714" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">25Prittie, 1964, pp. 33-34.</div> and eventually murdered 275,000
inmates. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_14806');">[note]</a><div id="_note_14806" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">26Wertham, 1966, p. 158.</div> The Chinese communists have brainwashing centers called

political dissenters by railroading them into mental hospitals, to be
"sorted out" as in the case of Valery Tarsis in "The Start of the Way of
the Cross." In the United States, Ezra Pound was hospitalized instead
of being tried for treason. Charles Olson describes a visit to the poet
in "Kavka and Pound." Also in the United States, officials have identified
intergrationists as the "lunatic fringe" by sending them to
mental hospitals. In the selection by Dr. Coles, "A Need to Disrupt
the Lives of Others," a hospital psychiatrist tries to convince a young
black civil rights worker that his activities are part of a personal
pathology.


Contrary to reality, every inmate is told that he is a sick patient who
needs medical healing: "...based on force and fraud, and justified by
‘medical necessity,’ the prime purpose of [institutional] psychiatric
treatments--whether utilizing drugs, electricity, surgery, or confinement,
especially if imposed on unconsenting clients--is to authenticate
the subject as a ‘patient,’ the psychiatrist as a ‘doctor,’ and the
intervention as a form of ‘treatment.’" <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_16150');">[note]</a><div id="_note_16150" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">28Szasz, 1971a, p. 64, bracketed word
added.</div> Witness the deceit abetted by
police coercion in the admission of a depressed woman in Jeffrey
Solomon's "Force and Fraud," and staff subversion of commitment
hearings in Al Siebert's "Too Mentally Ill." Institutional psychiatrists
will even resort to inventing guardianship requirements to ensure
admission or frustrate release: "If it is a relative who refuses to sign a
petition, he is told that he must sign a statement of release and assume
responsibility for the patient, although legally there is no such
requirement. When faced with this instruction, very often the relative
will reconsider and sign the petition." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_16850');">[note]</a><div id="_note_16850" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">29Rock <i>et al.,</i> 1968, p. 139.</div>


Mental hospital fraud is pervasive and apparently universal. A
British psychologist-inmate reports that "On admission, patients

Is the force and fraud justified? Certainly not for the small number
of inmates who are admitted because of medical-neurological
problems. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_18316');">[note]</a><div id="_note_18316" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">32Peszke, 1975, p. 33.</div> They could be diagnosed and treated voluntarily in <i>real</i>
hospitals and clinics. For the majority of inmates who simply have
problems in living that make them intolerable to others and
sometimes to themselves, medical quarantine is unfairly and
illogically applied to a nebulous, contrived "mental illness"
(examined by Dr. Thomas Szasz in <i>The Manufacture of Madness</i> <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_18745');">[note]</a><div id="_note_18745" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">33Szasz, 1970.</div>).
People in distress must be offered voluntary care only. Compulsory
institutionalization should not force anyone innocent of crime into
the official status of deviant.

1: Kicking, Screaming and Cursing
[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Fourteen-year-old Tony wore dirty clothes, gobbled his
food, fought with his brothers and sisters, cursed, and
disobeyed his parents--though he got along with the maid, Hanna.
He punched his brother in the nose when mocked with, "Tony goes to
the psychiatrist! Tony goes to the psychiatrist!" Tony had in fact been
sent to a number of psychiatrists--he had already quit the last, Dr.
Collins--who saw varying degrees of "illness" in the boy.


Is Tony merely a rebellious, disruptive boy, or is he "paranoid
schizophrenic," as he is eventually labeled? His mother takes pains to
characterize his babyhood and childhood as hectic and troubled and
emphasizes his early differentness and intractability. She also writes
that while he was at home, he thought his food was being poisoned,
but makes no connection with the fact that she and her husband,
Jack, had secretly put tranquilizers into his milk.


They finally find a mental hospital for juveniles that pleases them,
"The School," and force Tony in. He stays at The School for three
years, but the hopeful "straightening out," to use the mother's
expression, does not take place. See the excerpt in the Release section
for the outcome.


I HAD never known that the great metropolitan dailes are filled with
advertisements for special schools. Of course, they all sound equally
attractive and competent. I began to pore over them. I called several
on the telephone and had to rule out the first few because they would
not even consider taking a child who would not come willingly. But

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We visited several of the schools and were very discouraged. To
begin with, the physical environments were shocking. Some of these
places were so poor and barren they would make a normal person feel
depressed.


I remember one which sounded most promising when I talked to
the director on the telephone. He was a well-spoken man with a
doctorate and was a specialist in the psychology of the emotionally
disturbed adolescent. His school occupied a piece of acreage carved
out of second-growth woods and sumac scrub on a main highway. He
and his wife lived in a small frame house, and about fifty feet away
were the students' quarters, in a long frame building shaped like a
railway car. It was divided into cubicles much like a boarding kennel,
clean, well-heated and bare.


Outside there was a basketball net nailed to a tree and a very small
pond "where they can skate when it freezes over," we were told.


"What else is there for recreation?" we asked.


"Oh, we take nature walks, we drive into town."


The town through which we passed consisted of four or five blocks
of stores and a shabby movie theater. I couldn't imagine what the
boys could do after they got there.


"We have a psychiatrist who comes over on Thursdays," the
director said. "And of course the curriculum is college preparatory. I
teach and I have a well-qualified assistant. We have some very fine
students here."


"And the fee?" Jack inquired. He was merely filling the silence,
because I knew he would have never left Tony here. I wondered what
kind of parents possibly could have done so.


"Five hundred dollars a month," was the reply. "All inclusive."


Jack said we would think it over and have Tony's doctor get in
touch with him.


"I do want to add one thing," the man said. "Whether or not you
decide to send your son to my school, I must advise you to send him
somewhere. Don't try to keep him at home."


He was really decent; undoubtedly, given funds, he could have set
up something much better. He was surely aware of how disgracefully
inadequate his facilities were. But it only showed how desperate the
need is and that people in desperate need settle for almost anything.


"You can see for yourselves that your boy isn't improving at home.

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"That's true."


"And it is simply not fair to the other children. Take the boy away
before irreparable damage is done. That's my most candid advice to
you."


We thanked him and drove away. His admonitions made a great
deal more sense to me than what I had been hearing from Dr. Collins
about endurance.


<i>Or did it only make more sense because it offered me an easy way
out, because it was what I wanted to be told?</i>


Now events picked up momentum. What had been a very gradual
descent, with interludes of apparently slight improvement, now
suddenly became that steep-pitched slide. The gentle springtime was
ominous. There was no Dr. Collins to run to via the telephone in
emergencies. So often his advice had been useless or impossible to
carry out; still it had been something, a willing ear, an encouraging
word. Now Jack and I alone, or rather Hanna and I during the day,
had to hold the fort. And fort it was, an armed encampment.


Tony would come home from school and sit in front of the
television. For the first time his work fell off; his interim report card
was the first poor one in a lifetime of A's. But instead of studying, he
sat in front of the television, brooding rather than seeing.


No one dared come into the room. When one of the other children
ventured in, there would be a shout of rage: <i>Get the hell out of here!</i>
And they got out, because there was nothing I could do except to beg
them to keep away from Tony. And they knew there was nothing I
could do.


He no longer came to the table to eat with the family. He waited
until we were all finished and then helped himself in the refrigerator.
He refused to touch any food that I had prepared or handled; even a
bakery cake, if my hand had untied the string. Not until years later
did we hear he was afraid his food was being poisoned.


We were floundering. I found myself, in my desperation,
quarreling with Jack.


"Will you find a place for him, get him out of this house? What kind
of father can watch his family die by inches like this? You're a doctor.
Can't you do something, anything?"


It was most unfair, because Jack was as helpless and frightened
as I.


Then at last we came to the place I shall call The School. I do not

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was a welcoming place. Despite all our apprehensions and
overwhelming sense of defeat as we sat in the waiting room, we felt
that instantly.


Memory plays strange tricks. I don't know what made me think,
while we waited there, of the day we had been married. How the
world had glittered that day! If you loved each other and worked
hard, if you were loyal and honest, life would reward you. It is just as
well we could not have known the strange places to which life would
bring us.


I looked secretly at the other faces in the waiting room. There was a
handsome young couple with a look of security and position. Surely
they never expected to be sitting here! Then an older couple, gray,
shabby and genteel, she in a clean cotton dress and worn gloves;
apparently life had not been easy for them, and you could tell they
were bewildered, as if to ask why the extra burden had been put upon
them.


Finally we were directed to a pleasant man, the psychiatric social
worker who would listen to our story. He had already gone over the
papers on his desk, the history of Tony sent by Dr. Collins.


We shook hands. "Our doctors have gone over all this," he told us,
indicating the papers. "If you are still interested after we have
answered all your questions, I believe we will accept Tony. He seems
to be a child we might help."


And he explained, "We do not accept psychotic children here. Only
the emotionally disturbed, those with behavior problems. We offer a
tightly structured environment, with highly individual attention. The
ratio of staff to students is three to one."


We sat there carefully listening and yet not really considering. We
had already made up our minds. This was the place. There was an
unmistakable warmth about the comfortable brick ivy-covered
houses which lay scattered over the enormous meadows and sheltered
behind old trees. At a bend in the driveway we had seen a pond where
boys could swim in the summer and skate in the winter; from where
we now sat we could hear cries from a ballfield across the lane. The
slap of tennis balls came from the courts just below the windows.

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"... no one is ever left alone to sink into depression or get into
trouble. Every minute is accounted for, between study and
recreation. The staff people work in conjunction with whatever
psychiatrist is attending any particular boy."


"What is the average length of stay?" Jack inquired.


"Anywhere from one to three years. It's hard to give an average. By
the time we are through with them, which is by the time they have
completed the high-school course, they are ready to go to college or to
work or to whatever place in life the individual is fitted for."


Hope, irrepressible, began rising inside me again. "In other words,
most of the boys really turn out well?"


"Yes, I would say so. You may wonder what it is we do. No magic, I
assure you. But you see, by taking the boy out of the home where the
whole family is so emotionally involved, and raising him in the care of
impartial, trained people, we can inculcate a whole new set of living
habits. It is a conditioning process which no parent, however skilled,
devoted or intelligent could possibly effect."


That made sense.


"And so often at home these children resist psychotherapy. Here
there is no choice about going. It is part of the weekly routine, like
meals, basketball practice or math class. I note here that Tony has not
seen his psychiatrist for the past few months."


"No, we have not been able to make him go. We're really in a pretty
bad situation at home."


A sympathetic nod. "I can imagine. It can be rough on the family.
What does Tony think about coming here? You've discussed it with
him, of course?"


"Well, one doesn't <i>discuss</i> anything with Tony at this point. We
told him, we informed him, that we were looking into this as a
possibility. And he has flatly refused to have anything to do with it."


"He won't come?"


"No, I really don't know what we're going to do," Jack said, "if we
can't persuade him."


"I suppose he will have to be brought forcibly."


"I suppose so. My brother, maybe," Jack said. There was a
miserable silence, thinking about that, and then Jack asked, "May we
discuss the fee?'


"Oh yes. It is high. It has to be, for what we give. The fee is six
hundred dollars a month."


It did not mean a thing to me at that moment. If he had said six

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They were to make room for Tony the following week. That was
the longest week in my life. I literally counted the hours. The tension
in our house built up so that it seemed surely something, someone,
might burst open.


Yet the very night before we were to go, Jack would have changed
his mind. Neither of us could sleep. We sat up late, whispering. Jack
wanted reassurance, desperately. "Are we doing the right thing,
Louise? Should we try longer?"


I threw up my hands. "How can we ask it of ourselves? Or of the
children?


"I don't know. And yet--we have to give Tony every chance. We
owe it to him."


"Jack, maybe they'll help him at The School. I feel so strongly that
they will. We aren't doing a thing for him here."


"That's true."


We took Tony in the morning. Quietly, so that he would not hear
and suspect, Russell [Jack's brother] and another man, the only
other one who knew our story, parked their car down at the end of the
driveway and entered by the back door, which had been left open for
them.


Tony had to be taken bodily from his room, kicking, screaming,
and most terrible of all, cursing Jack and me for putting him out of his
home. Jane and the twins had already left for school and mercifully
were spared the scene. Hanna hid in the kitchen, wringing her hands.
The two men got Tony into the back seat of the car between them;
Jack drove. I drove the second car alone with all the luggage.


And so Tony left home.


I suppose we were all, in a sense, numb that day. But The School
held forth such hopes to us. Though I had not figured out how, I truly
believed that somehow they would know something no one else had
known. I believed that in a year or two Tony would be straightened
out; that he would come home and go to school and live with the
family in peace. If I had known how it was to be I would surely not
have been able to get through that day as steadily as I did.


I drove the car two hundred miles, to The School. I met the staff
and said the ordinary things. I knew what the right behavior must be.
I knew I must manage for Jack's sake. Also, I must confess I had some

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We came home, exhausted and emptied. We sat down to dinner
with our children. It was the first, sane, quiet dinner hour in years.


The children talked of their own affairs; not a word about their
brother was said. They were so young, and surely they could not
understand the whole truth of what had happened. Yet I knew that
they were aware that something deeply moving had taken place, and
tactfully were trying to help their father and mother.


When we had almost finished dessert, Jack spoke. "We are all
thinking of Tony tonight. He's in a good place, a school where they
will help him get over his troubles. After a while," he said smiling at
the three still faces, "he will be coming back to us."


There was no comment and presently they all excused themselves
to do their homework. Right afterward Jack and I went to our room
and fell asleep.


It was at least a week later that I really understood what had
happened. I was driving one forenoon toward the shopping center
and there ahead of me on Maple Avenue I saw a boy. The shape and
walk were so familiar that I thought absently: what is Tony doing out
of school? Then I remembered; blind with tears, I had to stop the car.
At last I knew my heart was broken.


Soon after, Tony wrote us a letter beseeching us to take him home.
Jack answered it carefully. Very lovingly, he explained why it would
be best for him to stay where he was for the time being. Tony's
answering letter was a tirade of furious threats and hatred. Then no
more letters came; there was silence.

2: Conspiracy Against the Weak
[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A family argument turns into a wrestling match that
ends with seventeen-year-old Peter being sent to a
psychiatric ward by ambulance. Despite efforts of Dr. Viscott, his
supervisor Jerry Gelb, and fellow resident Bert Feinstein, "research"
ensnares Peter, and face-saving maneuvers prolong the teenager's
stay.


SOME OF the admissions to Bamberg 5 were ridiculous. They often
resulted from people losing control and picking on the most
vulnerable member of their family, labeling him sick and sending him
to the hospital as a human sacrifice to solve everyone else's problems.


Anyhow that was the way it seemed with Peter Atkins. Peter was
seventeen and had growing pains. He was continually arguing with
his mother over the proper length of his hair, fighting with his father
over the use of the family car, and battling with his younger brother
over anything at all. His brother also fought with his parents just
about as frequently.


One evening, all the other members of the family formally declared
war on Peter. Peter and his brother were fighting over the ownership
of a particular sports jacket Peter planned to wear on a date that
night. Father wasn't sure Peter should have the car since he hadn't cut
the lawn as he had promised. Nor had he cut his hair, so mother also
joined the fun.


Understandably Peter felt outnumbered. Father called in a next-door

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Blade told the family, "That's not like Peter I know. Something
has changed. He may be having an emotional break." Another reason
why I love surgeons--at times like this they all seem to act like a Back
Passage.


Peter grabbed the disputed sports jacket and headed for the door.
Dr. Blade shouted, "Don't let him out." Father and brother pounced
on him and held him down. While he was being held down on the
Oriental rug in the entrance hall, he started to cry, something he
hadn't done in years. That stopped them. At Dr. Blade's suggestion
(prompted by his guilt?) Peter was taken by ambulance to Bamberg 5.
By ambulance! Can you believe that? I wanted to ask Mr. Atkins
when Peter arrived why he didn't have a police escort. I'm sure Atkins
would have told me that Dr. Blade didn't think of it. Would someone
please check if Blue Cross covers police escorts?


I had no choice but to admit Peter overnight because the situation
at home was so overheated. I opened our session by saying "I've
already heard your father's, your mother's, and your brother's side of
the story--all at once. If you've been through what they put me
through you probably could use a vacation from them." Peter looked
clobbered but he managed to smile. After Peter told me his story I
said, "Well, this is the mistake of the century. When do you want to go
home? How's tomorrow morning?"


"Home?" he said, startled. "I can go home?"


"Sure, there's nothing wrong with you," I said, getting up from my
chair. "Want a pizza?"


Peter stared at me disbelievingly, but eventually managed to put
away two pizzas at Primo's Pizza down the street. He liked them
large, with extra cheese and without anchovies. Peter, after all, was a
growing boy. We talked and cleared the air. By the time we got back
to the ward Peter at least felt someone understood him. He was
completely relaxed, although somewhat thirsty. Helen Doran, who
adored adolescents, gave him a quart of milk, which he gulped down
from the cardboard container in one swig, in classic locker-room-after-winning-the-big-game
style. Peter asked for some cookies to
wash down the milk.


"It's great to see a normal kid on the ward for a change," said

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Carol Downs, the psychiatric social worker, appeared on the ward.
It was nine thirty. Why is she here? I wondered. "I was asked to speak
with you about the Atkins family," said Carol. "I would like to see the
Atkinses and evaluate each family member individually and then
together as a family unit later. It's a new program in the social service
department. We'll be seeing the family of each new patient as well as
the patient from the time of admission. We'll follow them through the
hospitalization all the way to discharge and in follow-up visits after
discharge."


"Sure, but you'd better hurry, Carol, because this kid is going to be
discharged tomorrow so he can make Saturday morning baseball
practice."


"You can't do that without a formal presentation!" Carol
protested. "This is a new program. My supervisor and the head of the
psychiatric social worker training program will be at the presentation.
It's important. I've been assigned to the case. We need a
minimum of fifteen case studies to meet the requirements of the
grant."


"Well, you'll have to evaluate the Atkinses on an outpatient basis."


"No, I can't. We need at least one week in the hospital to determine
an emotional baseline."


"Well, this patient isn't going to be here a week. So he isn't suitable.
And I think your study is unscientific." (I shouldn't have said that.)


"Well, he can't be discharged without a workup," Carol said.
"That's <i>standard operating procedure."</i> Carol was pulling protocol
and at a loose end in her cardigan. Here it was a warm May night and
she was still wearing a sweater!


"This kid shouldn't have been admitted." I practically shouted. "I
won't compound one error by making another. I'm writing an order
to discharge him tomorrow."


I did.


The next morning I told Bert what was going on and left the
hospital at nine. Tough luck, Bert, having duty on a weekend as
beautiful as this.


When I came in on Monday I found Peter Atkins waiting for me at
the nurses' station.


"What the hell are you doing here?" I asked.

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"They changed your order."


"Can I see you?" said Bert, who apparently was also waiting for me
to appear. "It's about this case."


"Come on, Peter, you're going to sit in on this."


"Good for you, David," called out Jackie Rose as we walked to my
office. "Let the kid know what's happening."


Bert sat in my chair. I sat on the desk. Peter sat in the patient's
chair.


"Carol Downs," Bert began, his chair squeaking like crazy, "called
her supervisor, who called Dr. Noyes, and Dr. Noyes rescinded your
order."


"On what authority?" I demanded, forgetting Bert was on my side.


"He made up some bullshit about it being too impulsive a decision
and that an adequate evaluation was not possible in that short a
time."


"Maybe not enough time for Noyes to evaluate an adolescent,
because no adolescent I know would talk to that authoritarian son of
a bitch."


"We got along just great," Peter said. "You guys have the same
bullshit here that I get at home."


"The kid's got a point," Bert said. "Did you have breakfast?" he
asked, inviting Peter to join him in the coffee shop. <i>Everyone</i> could
tell Peter was OK.


I walked by Dr. Noyes' office and asked to see him. Field Marshall
von Noyes happened to be free. As a matter of fact, his secretary said
he <i>wanted</i> to see me.


"Ah, yes," Dr. Noyes began, "I hear there was some sort of
misunderstanding this weekend. You know Dr. Michael Blade, the
surgeon, don't you? A fine man. A fine surgeon, and one of the most
respected people on the medical school staff. An excellent teacher--
excellent. Well, when one of our own, so to speak, sends us a patient, I
think we owe it to him to give the patient as professional a workup as
we know how, don't you? We must not act impulsively. It's not only
bad practice, but it gives the department a bad name. Also, there is a
departmental study for which, according to the descriptions of the
case I have received, this boy and family would be excellent
candidates. I'd like to see that we get a good baseline of family-patient
interaction for the study. You do agree, don't you?"


"No, I--"


"Are you so confident of what you casually observed about this

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"He was evaluated," I said.


"By you." Noyes stated.


"Yes, by me. This boy was--"


"I am quite familiar with his story. I spoke with the head of social
service."


"But she didn't see the patient!"


"No, but Miss Downs saw the family."


"Do you mean that a decision based on the firsthand experience of
a resident trained in your program with a patient is going to be
overruled by people who never saw the patient? That's the craziest
thing I ever heard of."


"That patient must be evaluated before discharge," Noyes said,
restating his position. "And Dr. Viscott, if you have any comments or
opinions you will keep them to yourself. We don't want to appear
anti-research."


I called Jerry Gelb as soon as I got out of Noyes' office. You can't
win an argument against Noyes, and I was afraid that if I tried he'd
hold it against me and be vindictive enough to ruin my references.


Jerry was sympathetic to my argument. He saw Peter Atkins,
agreed with me, and was willing to sign a discharge order. Peter
Atkins left; Carol Downs called her supervisor; and M. Austin Noyes
called Jerry and me in on the carpet.


"What do you have to say, Dr. Viscott?"


"I don't think he needs to say anything," said Jerry. "I saw the
Atkins boy. I read the admission note. I know Dr. Viscott, and I trust
his judgment. The standard I used, Austin, was simple. I asked
myself, if the boy were my private patient would I keep him in the
hospital. The answer was I would not. I didn't think the boy even
needed an appointment for a follow-up visit. To keep him in the
hospital unjustifiably would only have given him more ammunition
to use against his parents and make it more difficult for him to come
to terms with them later on."


"I think the boy should stay here, Jerry," Noyes repeated. "I said as
much."


"But you didn't talk with him," Jerry pointed out.

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I'm planning to see him on Wednesday. I have a meeting with the
Planning Committee for the new mental health center on Mondays."


Noyes had not been terribly active treating patients for several
years. He rarely saw patients as far as I could tell. He was an
administrative psychiatrist, a political. He wrote a lot of articles,
enjoyed an excellent reputation and was involved in a lot of
departmental infighting. He arranged university appointments for
the people he liked and was active in the politics and planning of
community mental health facilities. He often carried blueprints with
him to conferences. It got to the point where I felt I was taking a
graduate course in architecture. I suspected he saw the Governor
more frequently than he saw any patient, especially an adolescent
patient like Peter.


No one in the department really seemed to like Dr. Noyes, and
many psychiatrists, supposedly even some grown-up psychoanalysts,
were afraid of him. Amazing. Or maybe not, if you had certain
ambitions.


M. Austin Noyes stopped and looked at both of us, as if he
expected us to understand how much more important his appointment
was than this trivial matter.


"Wednesday's a long time for a kid who wants to be out playing
baseball," I said.


"Young people are remarkably resilient, Dr. Viscott. A few days in
the hospital will not be as upsetting to him as you think. And certainly
not as disruptive as the rebellion I'd have between this department
and social services and the department of surgery. You've made Dr.
Blade appear like an ass."


I kept my big mouth shut for a change, and walked out with Jerry.
Jerry sighed. "I was sure you were going to say something." He was
almost right.

3: Where They Can Force People to Stay
[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Dakin Williams received a phone call from his
frightened brother Tennessee in Florida, he went out
to join him immediately and suggested that the playwright enter a
hospital. They flew to St. Louis the same night, and Tennessee
checked into Barnes Hospital a day later. He tried to walk out when
the staff took away the sedatives and liquor he had been using
regularly, but Dakin quickly arranged to have him sedated and
committed to the hospital's psychiatric division. Dakin didn't tell him
that he could leave after ten days. Tennessee ended up staying two
months. Furious, he later had Dakin's power of attorney rescinded,
and he adjusted his will so that his brother would get nothing.


Dakin tells of visiting his brother on the evening of his admission to
Barnes Hospital and the aftermath.


"I WENT by that evening and he was sitting up in the Queeney Tower.
He had his bottle of booze and his bag of pills, and he looked like he
had the world by the tail. Everything was fine. But the hospital was
just making routine tests. The next day they came to some
conclusions about him. They took away the booze and the pills.
Tennessee did what he always does--he started to walk out. I'd sent
him a big bouquet of flowers in hopes of getting a nice welcome, but
he was furious with me. The doctor was there--a neurologist--and he
was going to just let him walk out. So I said to myself, ‘Good God,
I've got him this far, I'm not going to let him leave if I can help it.’ I got

"I didn't see him for three days because he was so infuriated. He
also had three convulsions coming off the Doriden. He nearly died.
The doctors said so. I was there every day except when he would get
angry at me. Then I'd stay away for two or three days to pacify him.
After a while he became very friendly and very much himself. I hadn't
seen him that way in several years; I'd almost forgotten what it was
like. Y'know what one of the doctors told him? ‘Tennessee, if you play
ball with us, you'll write better than you ever wrote in your life.’ That
was very clever, I thought, motivating him like that. After that first
month he stayed in voluntarily the second month. He could've gotten
out in ten days if he had known his legal rights, but I didn't tell him."

4: The Kidnapping
[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Earl Long had served as governor of Louisiana from
1939 to 1940 and 1948 to 1952. He was nearing the end
of his third term in 1959 when he unsuccessfully tried to stay in office
in spite of a state law prohibiting consecutive terms. "Feeling his
power slip away, the governor upbraided first a House committee
and then a joint session. Pausing only to sip bourbon from a soft-drink
bottle, he loosed a stream of profanity and invective that
appalled his listeners," read his obituary in <i>The New York Times</i> on
September 6, 1960.


A few days after that performance, following a night of bargaining
at the Executive Mansion that involved both doctors and politicians,
Long was heavily sedated and flown in a National Guard plane to
Galveston, Texas, where his wife committed him to a mental hospital.
There he was diagnosed "paranoid schizophrenic." He implored her
to sign him out. She did, on the condition that he submit to
psychiatric treatment in Louisiana. But Long stalked out of
Louisiana's Oshner Foundation Hospital the day after he entered and
sped toward Baton Rouge, in a state police car. Mrs. Long had a
commitment order drawn up. As the governor approached the state
capital, he was seized and placed in Mandeville State Hospital. His
aides engineered his release nine days later by calling a meeting of the
Long-controlled State Hospital Board, which fined Mandeville's two
chief administrators and replaced them with men who certified the
governor sane. As Allen Ginsberg has written, "Sanity a trick of
agreement."


"THEY MISLED me. The reason I was feeling so poorly at the last
Legislature was I had kept on postponing an operation that I was to

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Then when they got me to the plane the bonecrushers strapped me
to the stretcher and a doctor stuck me through the britches with a
needle. My wife and nephew promised they would come right down
to Oshner next day to see me. But the plane flew me to Galveston, and
my sweet little wife hasn't shown up yet, neither my little nephew.
When the plane landed me at that airport, there, they told me I was
going to a rest house, where I was promised a double bed and quiet.
The doctors gave me pills to make me sleep. First I took them one by
one, then by the papercupful. Then I got to chunkin' them in there by
the wad. While I was in that condition, they got me to sign a thing that
I wouldn't sue them for kidnapping. I went contrary to what my
lawyers would have wanted....


"They snatched me out without even enough clothes on me to cover
up a red bug and a week after I arrived in Texas I was enjoying the
same wardrobe. They put me in a room with the door open and crazy
people walking in and out all night; one of them thought it was the
toilet....


"Then, this Corner here. Wasn't he a nice judge to commit me to
Mandeville when I come back? We been on opposite sides in politics
as long as I remember, but if the position had been reversed, I might
have given him a break. And Bankston, the superintendent, a man I
appointed myself, could have left me out, but he wouldn't. But I got
out, all right. I put <i>him</i> out and <i>got</i> out."

Reacting to the sadness and anger in her life, Janet Gotkin
slashed her wrists time and again. After a failed suicide
attempt at the first series of hospitals to which she was sent, she feels
that her doctor had "... said, in effect, ‘If you continue to act in
accordance with your deepest feelings, we will send you away to a
state institution. If you stop acting on the truth of your despair, we
will give you your freedom.’" Like the mental hospital inmate who
protests, "I am not crying because I am crazy, but because I am sad," <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_57363');">[note]</a><div id="_note_57363" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1Dembo and Hanfmann, 1935, p. 383.</div>Gotkin refuses to consider herself sick. She understands the threat of
indefinite institutionalization and alienation in the sickness label:
"Maybe I am sick, but if it is a sickness, it has become me, and I am no
longer like the rest of the people I knew and know. My world is
hounded by mental hospitals, doctors, drugs, and shock treatments.
These people who say they want to help me have turned me into--
into--an outsider. I have never been so alone in my life."


This selection takes place in the doctor's office, three days after
Janet has slashed her wrists in his office, and prior to her first
hospitalization. When her father asks the psychiatrist what the
verdict is, he's expressing the widespread belief that psychiatrists
have the right to pass judgment.


MY PARENTS and I had our final interview with Dr. Berman three days
later. We huddled in our circle of easy chairs while the doctor sat
ensconced behind his fortresslike desk. The scene was eerily
reminiscent of our first meeting; only this time my sentence would no
doubt be stiffer. The crime had been greater.

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Well, what's the verdict?" my father asked numbly.


"She must, of course, be hospitalized as soon as possible. I have
tried to help her," Dr. Berman said gravely. "But, as you can see," he
added, gesturing toward my still-bandaged wrists, "she has been most
unresponsive and uncooperative."


"Of course," my parents mumbled. It was almost automatic, their
agreement.


If Dr. Berman, from his heights of professional wisdom, had
prescribed joining a chain gang to "cure" my illness, I think my
parents might have consented. Would the doctor do anything to hurt
their daughter? Didn't the doctor know best? Wasn't the psychiatrist
privy to information about his patient that the lay person couldn't
begin to understand? This wasn't a matter of choice; it was a question
of a sick person and a doctor's informed diagnosis and prescription.
Wasn't it?


Of course.


My parents must have had their doubts about putting me in a
hospital; just as they must have had their doubts about the wisdom of
my five-times-a-week psychoanalysis. But they respected achievement
and professional expertise. To have admitted their doubts
would have been to open a chink in the iron edifice of psychiatric
ominiscience. Then what would they do? Flounder and drown. And I
might still be in pain and confusion and distress. Love might say,
"Don't lock her up"; but what did love know? The expert said, "Lock
her up." The doctor had to know best. The doctor always knew best. I
was sick. I was mentally ill. I needed "help."


They were desolate, inconsolable, so deep in their own pain and
self-doubt they barely saw me at all. Horrified by the depth of my
despair, unable to face the implications of my misery, they wallowed
in guilt and helplessness, gratefully embracing Dr. Berman's
considered professional judgment.


No one asked me what I wanted to do, if anything; where I wanted
to go, if anywhere.


The unanimous opinion was that my opinion, if I had one, was
worthless. The moment I lifted my hand against myself, the instant I
violated the suicide taboo, I relinquished all rights to speak in my own
behalf.


No one questioned for an instant the assumption that my violence
against myself was irrational and "sick." No one asked, for even a
moment, if that act of desperate self-destruction could have been a

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Berman hid his anger under the cloak of objective psychiatric
evaluation and sent me away with a smirk and a sigh of relief.


"I don't know if I can do it," he said vaguely, "but I'll try to get her
on the emergency list at Oceanville Hospital. There's usually a three-month
wait, but ..."


My parents looked waxen, miserable, melted small from the
tensions of the situation. They looked at me, their looks filled with
pleas for understanding, reassurance, forgiveness. I couldn't blame
them, but I couldn't support them in their decision, either. We were
all on our own.


I listened to them making plans for my life. They were terrified, I
realized, by the single physical fact of the cuts on my wrists.


"Haven't they ever wanted to hurt themselves?" I wondered.
"Everyone does, sometime or other. The only difference is, I <i>did</i> it."


They were so terrified they wanted to get me put away quickly so
they wouldn't have to face their own madness and violence as it was
mirrored on my arms.


My mother and father wanted me to feel glad again--they loved
me. But they could not cope with the explicitness of my desperation.
They thought I would get help in the hospital. They were innocents;
they had no real reason for believing otherwise.


Dr. Berman, on the other hand, was speaking of other things when
he assured my parents I would get the help I so urgently needed.
When I emerged from the hospital, I would no longer cut my wrists; I
would be helped. Subliminally, if not consciously, my parents must
have understood his message and been glad. Glad for me; but glad for
themselves.


The interview was over. Dr. Berman shook hands with me. I
watched his eyes darting covertly back to my forbidden wrists. He
looked guilty, as if he was afraid his mama was going to discover him
looking at dirty pictures.


That weekend my father received a call. Dr. Berman had worked
with speed and efficiency; his influence had never served him better.
Two weeks later he was through with me and the threat of blood on
the carpets forever.


I entered Oceanville Hospital, Belville, New York, in Spring, 1962.
My career as a full-fledged mental patient had begun.

6: The Letdown
[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mrs. Lorenz and husband Cleve take rooms for
themselves on a psychiatric ward in preparation for
the transfer from another hospital of their nineteen-year-old son,
Ken, who is "obsessive-compulsive." Her overconfidence in
"research" gradually changes into a feeling of being caught up in
something terrible. See the Treatment section for the continuation of
her account.


WE HAD driven through the lovely grounds of that immense and
imposing center built like a city in itself. We had pulled up before a
towering building and climbed out, two tense, tired people, our spirits
clinging to the tail end of a star. Inside, we gazed about as we waited
for an elevator. The huge lobby, bright, bustling, modern, seemed
symbolic of all mankind's struggle for light, for knowledge. Men and
women in spanking white coats walked briskly about, some of them
in earnest conversation, others obliviously reading a "paper" that was
perhaps the summation of months or years of digging, exploring.


Researchers are a unique breed, in the main a dedicated, selfless
lot. Their intellectual curiosity gives them vitality, an air of promise
that shines forth like a beacon, exuding a hopefulness, an air of
expectation to which the most heavyhearted must respond. We were
to meet and talk with many of these men, and always their effect was
to renew our faith that, given enough time, tools, and money, there
was almost no problem that could not be solved. That faith has not
diminished, and we certainly felt it strongly then.


We took the elevator to the third floor and pushed through

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The head nurse greeted us with cordial reserve and introduced us to
other members of the staff. We had learned by now that several
families were participating in the project, and I looked forward to
meeting them. Here, like Ken, we would not be alone in our strange
environment. There would be other families who shared the common
denominator of a son's or daughter's mental illness. I looked forward
to good companionship with people whose mutual problems should
make for a mutually satisfying communal living experience. For me
this was of real concern.


But no family member was visible, to my vague disquiet. The unit,
except for the nursing staff, was quiet. Too quiet. Where was
everyone?


The head nurse left to make arrangements for bringing our
belongings up. Two aides pushing a huge supply cart appeared, and
Cleve went out with them to help. Since no room was assigned to us as
yet, our things were to be stored in one of the sleeping rooms until our
return the following week. It proved to be a starkly forbidding, tiled
room, which, the nurse hastily explained, had originally been built as
a seclusion room for highly disturbed patients; in this project it would
be used as a bedroom. I cringed as the nurse turned a key in the lock,
securing the door.


She then showed us about the unit, pointing out the family dining
and living areas, the play and all-purpose room, treatment room for
physical ailments, and the small kitchen used for evening snacks. A
newness and brightness prevailed, almost blotting out the grim tiled
bedroom.


"I'd like to show you a typical family bedroom," she said, knocking
gently on a door.


A small, wan, tired-looking man appeared, brightening at sight of
us. "You're the new family. Welcome!" The greeting was sincere and
warm; already a kinship of sorts was established.


At the nurse's, "May we show the folks your room?" he cordially
invited us in. We saw a spacious, tastefully appointed room, painted a
cheerful yellow, with attractive contemporary furnishings, and cozy
with personal belongings. It might have been a room in a modern new

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I hope Mrs. Daly will be up before you leave. She's down at the
beauty shop with our daughter Linda."


Back in the large, comfortable living room, I gathered from talk
among some of the nurses and attendants, that only a short while
before our arrival Linda had been involved in a violent incident in the
lobby. As Mr. Daly subdued her, she had struck him, knocking off his
glasses and breaking them. No doubt this explained his severe
headache.


While we were- still trying to take this in, Mrs. Daly and Linda
appeared, freshly coiffured from the beauty parlor. I was totally
unprepared for Linda's loveliness. I could only gaze at her,
confounded, trying to relate this tall blonde exquisite creature to the
incident just described. She was dainty; she was gracious; she had a
poise and a classic beauty that bordered on elegance ... until you
saw the vague glassiness of her eyes and the vacancy of her smile.
"How do you do," she murmured charmingly. And then oddly,
"Thank you very much!"


Mrs. Daly was lovely, too, in a small, blonde, eager way. She
welcomed us as warmly as her husband; we were drawn to her at once.
But never have I seen such dark circles as those that rimmed her eyes.
It was as if they had been drawn there, indelible reminders of some
long and terrible ordeal.


Next Molly, an exuberant eighteen-year-old girl, joined us,
walking in at her half-skipping little gait. She was a plump, rosily
attractive young person, who greeted us with winning enthusiasm.
Plumping down cozily beside us, she plucked a cigarette from a trim
plastic case, tapped it expertly on the arm of the chair, and chattered
amiably away ... about friends of hers who were patients in other
units and about practically everybody on the staff. Then she
branched off into everything from TV programs to marriage,
revealing an amusing mixture of sophistication and naivete.


"Wow, a man on the unit!" she laughed, demanding his vital
statistics when we told her about Ken. It all seemed so natural, so
everyday that I found myself thinking what a happy companion for
Ken she'd be.


At this point Mrs. Goodman, Molly's mother, came swooping
down on us. She was a distinguished-looking woman in her early

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And I did. "I'm glad to meet you, too," I said, meaning it.


She didn't hear; she was already plying us with personal questions,
mixed with a rain of incredible flattery. Totally bewildered and
acutely uncomfortable, I was rescued by the appearance of a
uniformed maid, wheeling a coffee cart; Mrs. Goodman sailed off
suddenly toward the refreshment tray.


Claire, the head nurse, had baked a batch of cookies as a special
treat. (Already we had been told to call the staff by their first names.)
Claire was a tall, rather gaunt, but immaculate person with auburn
hair, long-nosed, thin-lipped, exquisitely groomed, wearing street
dress rather than uniform. She seemed the perfect hostess as she
poured, and I looked happily about, feeling like the guest at a gay
afternoon party. The room with its modern decor was so
comfortable, so appealing; the group seemed to enjoy such a casual
camaraderie. What an environment for an ill person, I marveled.
What a change from the usual stark hospital atmosphere.


Audrey Prout, another young patient-member, joined us, a slim
attractive girl with a clean town-and-country look. Her mother
would not be arriving for a week or two, and in the interim Audrey
would be on her own. I wondered what was wrong with Audrey. As
with Molly, there was no distinct evidence of illness. An aloofness, a
reticence, yes, but illness? None that I could see. And I pondered on
the strangeness of this, the many faces of illness that, like the many
faces of human nature, are as varied and complex as the people
themselves.


As I regarded Audrey, this wholesome, well-built young woman, I
wondered about the problems, the circumstances that had brought
her to the institute. She appeared oblivious to our presence until
someone mentioned Ken; then, as Molly had done, she brightened
perceptibly. She warmed to us still more when she learned that we
came from her own state. We were mistaken about her reticence; she
had a refreshing candor that cut at once through the usual social
stiffness on first contact. This lack of inhibition is a characteristic that
often distinguishes the mentally ill from the normal, so-called. The
facade, the false veneer, is stripped away. If only one could retain the

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was to be a clinical meeting at three, and we waited with
interest for it to start. Precisely at five minutes of three, aides and
family members arranged the chairs to make an informal circle. By
three everyone was seated, chatting much as any group would.
Precisely on the hour, Dr. Cohane, the director, and Dr. Dimmock
walked in. We had not seen Dr. Cohane during the past six months,
and I was eager to greet him and thank him for our presence here
today. I waited for some sign of recognition as the group quieted and
the doctors sat down. Then I would go to him.


However, such terms as "patient-centered," "patient-directed,"
"objective professional stance" were not yet within my scope of
comprehension. Thus what ensued was completely baffling. Dr.
Cohane greeted no one. His expression was immobile, deadpan.
Once he peered about the room, and I tried to catch his eye. But a curt
nod to Cleve and me--evidently a major concession--discouraged
any further familiarity. Convinced that he recognized us, I waited for
the moment when we'd at least be officially welcomed into the
"family." I was not looking for special treatment, but a word of
acknowledgment, an introduction, seemed only civilized. But none
came, not from him or Dr. Dimmock or the head nurse Claire or the
social worker who'd interviewed us earlier. Not from anybody. The
climate felt so cool, so indifferent as to be apathetic. Nervously I
glanced at Cleve, wondering how he was reacting. He above all must
retain his enthusiasm. But Cleve's expression, too, was noncommittal,
as if he had caught the strange contagion.


Feeling hollow in the pit of my stomach, I sat as silent as the rest.
Why didn't somebody call the meeting to order? What in the world
could be holding things up? Surely they weren't waiting for Cleve or
me to speak! I looked at Dr. Cohane, half expecting some clue, but as
far as he was concerned we were not even there.


Silence can invite meditation, reflection. It can be calming,
tranquilizing, acting as water or sunshine to draw out roots of
thought, inviting them to blossom. But not this silence ... it was
harsh and cold, almost ominous. Everyone sat as rigid as zombies,
including the nurses, and I wondered about their being here. The
whole performance was so mystifying it was like being onstage in
some grotesque play. Its meaning escaped me.

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Occasionally there was movement. Once Mr. Daly changed
positions and lit a cigarette. So did Mrs. Daly. Now maybe someone
would speak. No one did, but there was a chain reaction; others began
to shift about in their chairs, to light cigarettes. Mrs. Goodman
nervously fingered her many-stranded pearls. But still no one spoke,
and the heavy tension was not relieved until Linda suddenly stood up.
All eyes followed her as she walked over to her father, asking in her
innocently appealing, childlike voice, "May I have a cigarette,
Daddy? Thank you very much," she added mechanically.


The eyes followed her as she strolled over to the full-length mirror,
where she stood in narcissistic contemplation, turning the better to
admire herself, lifting her arms, pirouetting, smiling, laughing
hollowly. It was sad and startling, this lovely creature lost in her own
dream world, but it furnished a form of weird relief.


Surely someone will call her back, I thought. But no one did. Then
all of a sudden she walked briskly to her seat, plunged her face in her
hands, and crouched there, locked away. The silence continued, the
long, long silence that began to beat as loud as a thunderous drum.
Speak up! Somebody, say something, I wanted to shout, and I looked
at Cleve, hoping he would speak, make some witty comment about
the silence ... anything. But Cleve sat as mute as the others. Then it
dawned on me: this must be their way of inviting relaxation, trying to
put people at ease. Naively I made myself more comfortable, sighing
audibly. This only turned all eyes in my direction, as if they expected
me now to speak.


Everything comes to an end eventually. It was Mr. Daly who
finally was the first to give up in what seemed like a grim game in
which everybody strove to outlast the others. He cleared his throat.
Choosing his words carefully, pacing them as slowly as if they were to
be held up for inspection by a board of censors, he announced: "Since
our guests will be joining us next week and Mrs. Prout will be coming
shortly, this might be as good a time as any to get the room situation
in shape."


Thank heaven, I thought, blissfully unaware that these innocent
words would precipitate a small-scale war. I listened intently,
wondering what rooms would be assigned to our family.


Mrs. Goodman promptly took up the cudgels. Fidgeting with her
jewelry, she declared her opposition to the proposed changes.
Moving two females back into one room instead of the two they now
occupied was unthinkable. "Why, with all Molly's clothes," she said,
her anxiety rising, "I wouldn't have room to turn around!"

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Claire's appraisal of the situation went unheeded. The ideas that
flew back and forth only agitated Mrs. Goodman further. She
repeated her earlier objections, injecting a note of suspicion.
Everyone was picking on her, the Dalys, the head nurse, everybody.
The Dalys, she insisted, would get what they wanted as usual. She, as
usual, would be left out in the cold. Evidently a few rooms were
favored over others. All but two had adjoining baths, and this, too,
seemed a factor in the heated exchange.


Since agreement seemed remote, the head nurse suggested forming
a committee to attempt to arrive at an equitable solution. And
directly after the meeting, the committee, composed of Mrs. Daly,
Mrs. Goodman, Audrey, and Cleve, adjourned to a near-by room.
Fifteen minutes later they filed out like a jury arrived at a verdict,
outwardly amicable over the decision, Mrs. Goodman apparently
appeased.


Arrangements began for the necessary moves. When shown the
room which would next week be ours, Cleve and I were pleased.
However, the room that now held our belongings, the room that had
chilled us on sight, had been assigned to Ken. The only compensating
factor was its private bathroom.


Then, as we were bidding good-bye to several people, somewhat
restored in spirit, a blood-curdling cry pierced the unit, followed by
sobbing, screaming, and moaning that made our blood run cold.
Tearing down the hall, face distorted, eyes blazing, hair disheveled,
and cursing loudly was a woman we did not recognize at first as Mrs.
Goodman.


"Dirty bitches, dirty bastards, they pushed me out of my room!"
Her voice broke; she gasped for breath, weirdly sucked in air, and
started to screech anew. The sound was so eerie I stood frozen, my
astonishment even greater than my horror. This woman was a
mother. Not a patient behaving in a psychotic manner ... a mother!


She stood there distraught, panting, hurling epithets, curses, and
vile oaths at everyone, the nurses and the staff, but mostly the Dalys,
accusing them of plotting against her. I expected that she would turn
on us next, since we and the Prouts were responsible for the change.
That we were by-passed did not lessen my fear. I was terrified,
speechless, and appalled by the fact that throughout all this the staff
members passed blandly by, seemingly unconcerned.


"Help her," I cried, when my dry tongue could get the words out.
"She's a very sick woman!" Nobody responded; with a little shrug

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then suddenly I remembered the private chat we had had with the
social worker the day we were being eased into the project by being
briefed on other members of the group. "Mrs. Goodman is
paranoiac," she'd said matter-of-factly, as if commenting on her
political affiliation. That's psychiatry for you, I'd thought, throwing
labels indiscriminately around, and I had dismissed it from my mind.
She must have been mistaken; this project was set up for emotionally
disturbed offspring, not parents.


Now all this rushed back with shocking impact. What is this,
anyway? I wondered where she fit into the picture. What sort of
"family" project is this? What are we getting into? I remembered, all
too soon, that Linda Daly's room was on one side of ours ... Mrs.
Goodman's on the other.


My first dismay and fright had turned into indignation and
apprehension so appalling that I dared not admit it to Cleve. He, too,
viewed this psychotic display with amazement and concern.


We drove home in silence. There was little to say. We dared not
even tell each other what we were thinking. I had an overwhelming
urge to escape, to quit, to get out before it was too late. But that was
preposterous. I had talked Cleve into it. The house was rented. David
[their younger son] was registered in a new school. Arrangements had
been made to take Ken out of the hospital. And last but far from least,
Cleve was on leave from his job.


Our bridges were burned. We had to go forward ... into what we
did not know. There was no turning back now.

7: Staff Has Spoken!
[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a book about the mental health system, psychologist Walter
Fisher, former assistant superintendent of Elgin State
Hospital in Illinois, and two of his associates tell how an incestuous
couple was committed to their hospital. All the members of the family
had consented to the sexual relationship. The father and daughter
were productive, working to support themselves and the mother. The
staff insisted that they were dangerous to themselves and needed
hospitalization.


A SOCIAL worker accidentally finds out about an incestuous situation
and investigates. He discovers that a man in his sixties has been
maintaining an incestuous relationship with his thirty-year-old
daughter for five years. The mother, father, and daughter have agreed
to the relationship. The social worker takes it upon himself to petition
for the commitment of father and daughter. As a result the father
loses his job and is committed; the daughter loses her job and is
committed; the mother, without any means of support, goes on
public aid. Eventually, the family lose their home, and the father and
daughter become institutionalized. Staff has spoken!

8: Admission Struggle
[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ernest Hemingway was unhappy because he couldn't
concentrate on his writing. When he became suicidal,
his wife and doctor convinced him to return to the psychiatric section
of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. During an earlier stay there, Hemingway
had told Hotchner that the doctors did not understand him:
"What these shock doctors don't know is about writers and such
things as remorse and contrition and what they do to them. They
should make all psychiatrists take a course in creative writing so
they'd know about writers." He said during hsi final hospitalization,
"Hotch, if I can't exist on my own terms, then existence is impossible.
Do you understand? That is how I've lived, and that is how I <i>must</i>
live--or not live." He killed himself shortly after he left the hospital.


AT ELEVEN o'clock Sunday morning, April 23rd, I received a call from
Ketchum [Idaho]. Ernest was in the Sun Valley Hospital under heavy
sedation, sodium amytal every three hours, nurses around the clock.


When Mary had come into the living room that morning, she had
found Ernest standing in the vestibule, where the gun rack was; he
was holding a shotgun in one hand, with the breech open; he had two
shells in his other hand. There was a note propped up on top of the
gun rack addressed to her. Mary knew that Vernon Lord was due to
come by to take Ernest's blood pressure, so she just tried to hold
Ernest's attention until he got there. She knew he had been terribly
depressed about his inability to write, but she had had no inkling that
his depression had driven him this far.


Ernest was calm and did not make a move to put the shells in the

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Vernon had already put in a call to the Mayo Clinic and I was asked
whether I would contact Dr. Renown and brief him on the situation.


Vernon phoned at four-thirty that afternoon. He reported that the
Mayo doctors were insisting that Ernest go to Rochester voluntarily
but that Ernest absolutely refused to go.


"I called Dr. Renown," I said, "and he was to call Mayo and then
call you."


"He has. He made all the Mayo arrangements and discussed
procedures, but I don't think he knows about this condition they've
imposed, that Ernest go of his own free will. Hell, he doesn't have any
<i>free</i> will! What are they talking about? I have my associate, Dr.
Ausley, helping me with Ernest, but we're fighting the clock. We don't
have proper facilities for this kind of thing and, Hotch, honest to
God, if we don't get him to the proper place, and <i>fast</i>, he is going to
kill himself for sure. It's only a question of time if he stays here, and
every hour it grows more possible. He says he can't write any more--
that's all he's talked to me about for weeks and weeks. Says there's
nothing to live for. Hotch, he won't ever write again. He can't. He's
given up. That's the motivation for doing away with himself. At least,
on the surface. And that's what I have to accept because I'm not
equipped to deal with anything beneath the surface. But that's strong
enough motivation as far as I'm concerned, and I can tell you I'm
worried sick. We've got him shot full of sodium amytal, but how long
can we keep him in that state? I can tell you it's a terrible
responsibility for a country doctor. It's not just that he's my friend,
but he's <i>Ernest Hemingway</i>. We've <i>got</i> to get him to Mayo."


For the rest of that day we phoned back and forth between New
York, Ketchum, Hollywood and Rochester, but the Mayo doctors
could not be induced to come to Ketchum or vary in any way from
their adamant policy that patients must enter the clinic voluntarily.

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The following day Mary phoned, terribly shaken. There had been a
nightmarish incident. Vernon had finally gotten Ernest to consent to
re-entering Mayo, and the charter plane had been summoned from
Hailey. Ernest said, however, that before he went there were some
things he had to get from the house. Vernon said he would send Mary
for them, but Ernest said they were things he had to get himself and he
would not go to Mayo without them. So Vernon reluctantly
consented, but first he called Don Anderson, who is six foot three and
over two hundred pounds, to come along. Vernon took the nurse and
Mary also.


They drove up to the house, the five of them, and Ernest started
toward the door, followed by Don, then the nurse, then Mary and
Vernon. Suddenly Ernest cut loose for the door, slammed it and
bolted it before Don could get there. Don raced around to the other
door, charged into the house and spotted Ernest at the gun rack,
holding a gun and ramming a shell into the chamber. Don hurled
himself at Ernest and knocked him down. There was a terrible
struggle over the gun. Vernon had to help. Luckily, the safety had
been on so it did not go off. Ernest was now back at the hospital, more
heavily drugged.


He was now saying he would not return to Mayo's, but Vernon was
keeping the plane at the Sun Valley airstrip in the hope that he could
change Ernest's mind. In the meantime, discussions were being held
with people at Menninger's.


The next morning Mary phoned to say that Ernest had suddenly
consented to go and the plane had just taken off for Rochester.
Vernon and Don Anderson had gone with him. Mary was just barely
holding herself together. She promised to have Vernon call as soon as
he got back.


It was after midnight when the call came through. Vernon said that
he had given Ernest a heavy sedation before taking off but that
shortly after they had become airborne, Ernest had made a strenuous
effort to get the door open and jump out of the plane. It had taken all
of Don's and Vernon's combined strength to get him away from the
door. Vernon had then given Ernest a large injection of sodium
amytal, and soon thereafter he had become drowsy.

Shortly afterward the small plane had begun to develop engine
trouble and had had to be landed at Casper, Wyoming. On leaving
the plane, Ernest had tried to walk into a moving propeller, but Don
had had him by the arm and pushed himself between Ernest and the
propeller, although in so doing Ernest had almost inadvertently
bumped Don into the whirling prop.


It had taken a couple of hours to repair the plane, but Ernest had
seemed quiet until they were on their way again; then over South
Dakota, having feigned sleep for an hour, he had made a second
attempt to jump out of the plane.


Mayo doctors were waiting for them when they landed in
Rochester, and Ernest, who was now docile and greeted the doctors
like old friends, was immediately taken to St. Mary's, where he was
placed in a special security section and put under constant
surveillance.


"You know the date?" I asked.


"The twenty-fifth, isn't it?"


"Yes, almost three months to the day since they discharged him."


"Not a very long cure, was it?"

9: The Insanity Bit (I)
[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Krim was taken to a mental hospital once when he was
in an unihibited, free-wheeling state and again after he
almost killed himself. He admits that he was immature and reckless at
the time but points out that he "was aware of the ‘daringness’ of my
every move; it represented at heart an existential <i>choice</i> rather than a
mindless discharge." He experiences mental hospitals as "isolation
chambers ... a roped-off side-street of modern existence, rife with as
many contradictions, half-truths and lousy architecture as life itself."


See the Release section for the second portion of Krim's narrative.


UNTIL THIS time of complete blast-off in seemingly every department
of human life, the idea of insanity was thought of as the most dreadful
thing that could happen to a person. Little was actually know about it
and the mind conjured up pictures of Bedlam, ninnies walking
around in a stupor, a living death that lasted until the poor damned
soul's body expired and peace tucked him or her away for eternal
keeps. But in this era of monumental need to re-think and re-define
almost every former presumption about existence--which has
inspired a bombing way of looking at what once were considered the
most unbudgeable rocks of reality--the locked door of insanity has
been shaken loose and shall yet be hurled wide open. Until one day
the prisoners of this definition will walk beside us sharing only the
insane plight of mortality itself, which makes quiet madmen of us all.


Every American family has its "psychotic" cousin or uncle; every
friend has wept, prayed, hoped (and finally slid into indifference) for

I was as wrong as you can be and still live to tell about it. In the
summer of 1955, when I was 33, the thousand unacknowledged
human (not literary) pressures in my being exploded. I ran
barefooted in the streets, spat at members of my family, exposed
myself, was almost bodily thrown out of the house of a Nobel Prize-winning
author [Ernest Hemingway], and believed God had ordained
me to act out every conceivable human impulse without an ounce of
hypocritical caution. I know today that my instinct was sound, but
my reasoning was self-deceptive. It was not God who ordained me,
but I who ordained God for my own understandable human
purposes. I needed an excuse to force some sort of balance between
my bulging inner life and my timid outer behavior, and I chose the
greatest and most comforting symbol of them all. He was my lance

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

From Bellevue I was soon transferred to a private laughing
academy in Westchester and given insulin-shock treatments. No deep
attempt was made to diagnose my "case"--except the superficial and
inaccurate judgment that I had "hallucinated." Factually, this was
not true; I did not have visual images of people or objects which were
not there; I merely believed, with the beautiful relief of absolute
justice which the soul of man finds when life becomes unbearable,
that God had given me the right and the duty to do everything openly
that I had secretly fantasied for years. But this distinction was not
gone into by my judges and indifferent captors. They did not have the
time, the patience, or even the interest because work in a flip-factory
is determined by mathematics: you must find a common
denominator of categorization and treatment in order to handle the
battalions of miscellaneous humanity that are marched past your
desk with high trumpets blowing in their minds.


Like all the other patients, I was considered beyond reasoning with
and was treated like a child; not brutally, but efficiently, firmly and
patronizingly. In the eyes of this enclosed world I had relinquished
my rights as an adult human being. The causes for my explosion were
not even superficially examined, nor was the cheek-pinching house
psychiatrist--with a fresh flower in the button hole of his fresh daily
suit--truly equipped to cope with it even if he had tried, which he did
not. Private sanitariums and state institutions, I realized much later,
were isolation chambers rather than hospitals in the usual sense;
mechanical "cures" such as the one I underwent in a setup of
unchallenged authority, like the Army or a humanitarian prison,
slowly brought 75 per cent of the inmates down to a more temporarily
modest view of reality. Within nine or ten weeks I too came down,
humbled, ashamed, willing to stand up before the class and repeat the
middle-class credo of limited expressiveness and the meaning of a
dollar in order to get my discharge.


In three months' time I was out, shaken, completely alone, living in

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My plan was to take the pills and slowly conk out in the full
bathtub, ultimately drowning like Thomas Heggen; if one missed
the other would work. I splurged on a beautiful death-room in a
modernistic hotel, one that included a bathroom with the biggest tub
in the house. But it was too small to fit my long body. The idea of not
being able to drown and of surviving the pills afterwards, perhaps to
become a burden or an invalid, began to scar what seemed like a
paradise of suicide. I went instead to a Polish bar in downtown
Newark, vaguely seeking the eternal anodynes of snatch and booze
while I mentally played with my fate.


I found the booze and saw a coarse, ignorant Polish girl do such a
life-giving, saucy, raucous folk-dance (on the small dance-floor to the
right of the bar) that I broke into loving sobs like prayers over my
drink. The sun of life blazed from her into my grateful heart. I went
back to the beautiful hotel-room, poured the pills down the toilet,
and went to sleep. The next morning I returned to Manhattan a
chastened man, shaking my head at how close I had come to nonbeing.


When I told my tale to Mr. Pipe, my psychologist, he speedily

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Once again I was on the human assembly-line: electric shock
clubbed my good brain into needless unconsciousness (and I walked
to my several executions like a brave little chappie instead of
questioning them) and unquestioned Old Testament authority ruled
our little club. Good-natured, but mostly cowlike and uneducated
male orderlies carried out the orders from above; and apart from the
mechanical treatment and the unimaginative grind of occupational
therapy, each patient was left completely on his or her bewildered
own, a sad and farcical sight when one considered the $125 per week
that their frightened families were paying.


I saw now that nine-tenths of the people I was quartered with were
not "insane" by any of the standards a normally intelligent person
would use: the majority had lost confidence in their own ability to
survive in the world outside, or their families were <i>afraid</i> of them and
had palmed them off on "experts," but positively no serious effort
was being made to equip them to become free and independent
adults. This was their birthright--beyond country and society,
indeed an almost religious obligation--but they were palliated with
pills or jolted with shock, their often honest rage echoed back to them
as a sign of their "illness." Some of them must have been "sick," you
say. I answer: Who can not be conceived as such in a world so

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I now began to fight persistently--but still with shakiness--for my
release; my life was my own: it did not belong to the clichés of the
salesman-aggressive, well-barbered, Jewish-refugee (my brother, my
enemy!) house psychiatrist or to my smiling, betweeded nonentity of
a psychologist, who paid me diplomatically inscrutable visits like a
Japanese ambassador. Even if I had been or if there were such a
reality as a "raving maniac"--which, perhaps childishly, I implore the
over-imaginative, zeitgeist-vulnerable reader to believe is an
impossible conception today--I would and should have fought for
my release. What the institution-spared layman does not realize is
that a sensitive and multiple-reacting human being remains the same
everywhere, including a sanitarium, and such an environment can
duplicate the injustice or vulgarity which drove your person there in
the first place. By this I mean that a mental hospital is not an asylum
or a sanctuary in the old-fashioned sense: it is just a roped-off side-street
of modern existence, rife with as many contradictions, half-truths
and lousy architecture as life itself.


Both of the sanitariums I was in were comparable to Grossinger's,
in that they took in only financially comfortable, conventionally
middle-class, non-intellectual people. By every human standard my
being there was life's sarcastic answer to whatever romantic ideas I
had about justice. Since the age of 19 I had deliberately led an
existence of experimentation, pursuit of truth, bohemianism, and
non-commercialism: fate's punishment for my green naivete was for
me to recover my supposed mental health in this atmosphere of

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I heard this second house-psychiatrist literally equate sanity
with the current cliches of adjustment and describe Greenwich
Village as a "psychotic community," I saw with sudden clarity that
<i>insanity</i> and <i>psychosis</i> can no longer be respected as meaningful
definitions--but are used by limited individuals in positions of social
power to describe ways of behaving and thinking that are alien,
threatening, and <i>obscure</i> to them. (A year later when I took a
psychiatrist friend of mine to the San Remo, she told me with a
straight face that it reminded her of the "admission ward in Bellevue,"
where she had interned. This was her analogy on the basis of accurate
but limited experience, that increasing chasm which separates
intelligent people from understanding each other. I realized with a
sense of almost incommunicable helplessness that the gap between
her and the well-know poet with whom I had had a beer at the Remo
two weeks before was tremendous, and that between these two poles
of intelligence the neutral person--who could see the logic of each--
was being mashed up with doubt and conflict. The poet was at home,
or at least the heat was off, there; while the psychiatrist felt alien and
had made a contemptuous psycho-sociological generalization. There
was little bond of shared values and therefore genuine communication
between both of these intelligent and honest human beings, each
of whom contributed to my life.)


To finish with my four months in the sanitarium, I argued and
reasoned for the basic right to the insecurity of freedom, and finally a
good friend did the dirty in-fighting of getting me out. Had I to do it
over again, I believe I would now have the guts to threaten such an
institution or psychologist with a law suit, ugly as such a procedure

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mine had hardened as a result of my experiences, and I realized it
was better to die out in the world if need be than be deprived of the
necessity to confront existence because of the cheap authority of a
lock and key. The majority of people who stay in mental institutions
for any length of time do not want to return to the uncertain
conditions outside the wall: which in our time spells out to
emotionally anarchic, multidimensional, brain-trying, anxiety-loaded,
and--O hear me mortality, from the Year One--ultimate
and divine life.

10: A Sorting Problem
[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In telling about bringing people to local mental hospitals,
Sergeant Sykora of the Cicero, Illinois, Police Department
hits on the key question: "Is a law being broken?"


WHEN SOMEONE turns to the police for help, his attitude is often that of
turning to his last resort. Other efforts have failed and finally the
police are brought into the picture. People who make such a choice
are usually desperate. Recently a woman who had gone for days
without sleep turned to the police for help. She had been kept awake
by her husband who had been beating her and threatening her life.
Finally she came to the station and signed a complaint on a minor
charge and he was arrested. The next day he was taken to a
psychiatrist for examination and found to be in need of treatment.


The sad thing about this case was the wife's reluctance to sign
charges against her husband. She did not want to be caught in the
middle between him and the law. Moreover, she did not want to have
to face him upon his release. Such a predicament often leads to
pressuring the police to act without the person himself becoming
openly involved.


In less serious situations, usually during a long weekend when the
husband and wife spend a lot of time together, the police are often
called to break up a quarrel and to lock up one of the mates. By the
next morning everyone cools off and charges are dropped.


The point of the above is that the police see people in settings not
often encountered by many mental health professionals. They are
seen in the home, the squadrol, jail and at hospital intake. In each

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In bringing people to the hospital we try to use as little force as
possible. Usually we try to talk to them in a calm, familiar way, telling
them they are going to see the doctor at the hospital.


When we bring someone into the hospital we are faced with several
problems. Upon bringing a person to the hospital we often find that
when he gets there he refuses to sign a voluntary admission form and
runs away. Also, even when he is kept for evaluation or other reasons,
he may be released shortly after we leave the hospital. A few hours
later we are again faced with bringing in the same person. This seems
to happen more frequently during the evening hours. The hospitals'
discharge policies are confusing to us.


While waiting to be seen at intake with a patient, sometimes for
over an hour, we are often called upon to restrain the patient. Even
with the best conditions, such tasks are often upsetting to others
watching in the waiting room. The public has not seen prior
management problems the police have had in bringing the person to
the hospital and do not realize the possible trouble which would
occur if the police did not use enough force to restrain the person. We
are then seen as being unjustly forceful. A special waiting area for
police would be appreciated.


Another set of problems arise when we are summoned to the house
where the caller is either using us or does not know what is wrong but
wants us to make a decision. For example, we are sometimes called
on to remove someone from the home merely because someone else is
angry with them, not because a law has been broken. A similarly
confusing problem occurs when someone exhibits some sort of
temper tantrum, seizure or other puzzling behavior. In these cases we
are faced with a sorting problem. Are such people physically ill,
mentally ill, or malingering?


To be sure, there are still problems in the community mental health
system; however, things have gotten better since the inception of
catchment areas. A few years back the police had no definite single
place to bring people and often ended up taking people from one
hospital to another before we found a place that would accept them.

11: The Start of the Way of the Cross
[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Because Tarsis's <i>The Bluebottle</i> (1962) was critical of
the Khrushchev regime, he was sent to Moscow's
Kashchenko mental hospital for seven months. Through Valentine
Almazov, the protagonist in his fictionalized autobiography, <i>Ward 7</i>,
expatriate Tarasis recounts his examination at a way station for
inmates, and his ambulance ride and admission to Kaschenko mental
hospital, which he nicknames Kanatchikov Villa.


In striking parallel to the Chekhov passage that Tarsis quotes at the
beginning of his selection, Sovietologist Peter Reddaway reports
what a psychiatrist said to Soviet dissident Vladimir Borisov's wife
when she protested that her husband was sane. The doctor replied,
"Maybe, but he was unlucky; he is down on our register. What may be
a system of opinions in a normal person is a sign of illness in your
husband."


"BUT THERE are hundreds of lunatics who are at
large, just because you are too ignorant to
recognise they are insane. Why should I and
these other wretches have to sit here instead of
them and be your scapegoats? Morally, you and
your assistant and the other scoundrels on your
staff are infinitely worse than we are--why are
we locked up and not you? Where's the logic of
it?"


"Neither logic nor morality have anything to
do with it. It's a matter of luck. If you've been
locked up you are inside, if you haven't you are

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Anton Chekov<br />
<i>Ward 6</i>


In the morning Almazov was examined by the head city psychiatrist,
exactly as a prisoner is examined by a magistrate. He was
brought to Dr. Yanushkevich's consulting room under guard. The
doctor made no attempt to treat him as a patient; illness was never
even mentioned. Pink and smug, he seemed to take his role as prosecutor
for granted. Valentine, now that he had got through the night,
was calmer and ready to face his way of the cross.


"What's the game, eh?--writing anti-Soviet letters to foreign
embassies?"


"Are you in the police? I thought that doctors at least were
exempt."


"That's no way to talk."


"I don't wish to talk to a policeman."


"You are wasting my time. They can sort you out at
Kanatchikov's." He called the guard. "Take him back."


"You are a poor interrogator, you haven't learned your job yet,"
Valentine put in as a parting shaft.


It was raining. The same woman doctor, who had been on duty the
night before, saw him to the ambulance. He was driven away under
the triple escort of another doctor and two medical students, part of
whose training consisted in acting as guards. One of them asked him
if he was quite comfortable.


Almazov was preoccupied with the notion, still new to him but for
which he was finding more and more corroborating evidence--that,
so far from being socialist, the system which had finally become
established in Russia was a particularly vicious form of fascism.


"You remind me," he replied indifferently, "of the executioner who
asks his victim: ‘May I trouble you?’"


The students exchanged glances but said nothing. As Valentine
was to discover later, mental patients had one important privilege.
On condition that they remained calm (if they became violent they

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

An hour after he arrived he was interviewed by the doctor in
charge, Lydia Kizyak, who was the medical head of the section.
Valentine immediately sensed in her the inhuman bureaucratic type
usually admired as "one hundred per cent Soviet." There was a silence
while they looked at each other as warily as two duellists.


Born in 1917, Lydia Kizyak was a worthy contemporary of the
Revolution. Having made her career by hook or crook, she clung to
her position and was terrified of losing it.


She loved power, it was her only passion; yet she was nervous as a
cat.


"Well, let's get on with it," she began briskly. "Tell me about your
illness, your family, your background ..."


I forbid you to play the fool with me," Almazov said with
deliberation. "I don't suppose you want a row, so we'd better agree on
our terms of reference."


She fidgeted in her chair and looked round anxiously. There was
no one else in the large interview room, but just then an orderly came
in with a paper for her to sign. She signed it hastily and told him to
deliver it and come straight back. Almazov gave her a withering
glance.


"This is the position. I don't regard you as a doctor. You call this a
hospital, I call it a prison to which, in a typically fascist way, I have
been sent without trial. So now, let's get everything straight. I am
your prisoner, you are my jailer, and there isn't going to be any
nonsense about my health or my relations, or about examination or
treatment. Is that understood?"


"We'll have to use compulsory methods."


"You can try."


"All right. We'll see."

12: Kavka and Pound
[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During World War II, Ezra Pound made over three
hundred radio broadcasts from Italy in which he
attacked the United States and "the world conspiracy of Jewish
bankers," assisting propaganda campaigns conducted for Radio
Roma. Near the end of the war he gave himself up to the invading
Americans, who placed him in a special cage made of airstrip steel in
the yard of the detention camp at Pisa. After a few weeks of exposure
to heat, dust, and moisture, Pound had hysterical fits of terror, and
the prison doctor moved him to a tent in the medical compound.
When Pound was brought back to the United States to stand trial for
treason, lawyer Julian Cornell argued that the poet needed mental
hospital treatment because of his experience at Pisa. Cornell was
actually trying to get Pound out of the Washington, D.C., jail without
risking denial of bail. He was also trying to delay the treason trial
so that the public pressure for severity might abate. The court
remanded Pound to Gallinger Hospital for "examination and
observation."


The three government psychiatrists and one defense-appointed
psychiatrist who examined Pound at Gallinger concluded that he was
"paranoid" and legally insane and as such not capable of consulting
with counsel in his defense. They added that Pound was "in need of
care in a mental hospital." The prosecution, though, suspected that
Pound was feigning insanity--in Nuremberg only three weeks earlier
Rudolf Hess had confessed to feigning amnesia--and pressed for a
jury trial on Pound's mental state. Pound was duly transferred to
Saint Elizabeths Hospital, a federal mental hospital in a suburb of
Washington, where he was consigned to the prison ward, maximum
security Howard Hall. A Dr. Jerome Kavka was in attendance.


At the insanity trial Superintendent Winfred Overholser of Saint
Elizabeths, the star government psychiatric examiner and witness,

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Pound was sent back to Saint Elizabeths until such time as he
would be fit to stand trial. His lawyer soon convinced Overholser to
transfer Pound from the prison ward to the Chestnut Ward. Since
Pound was supposedly incurably insane, unable to stand trial, and
according to the doctors not dangerous, his lawyer argued that the
poet should be released. He was refused. In 1958 poet Robert Frost
helped untangle the knot by appealing to presidential assistant
Sherman Adams and Attorney General William Rogers, and
retaining lawyer Thurman Arnold. Superintendent Overholser still
held that Pound was "permanently and incurably insane," but agreed
that he was not dangerous. He belatedly admitted that "confinement
can serve no therapeutic purpose." Judge Laws then dismissed the
indictment and Pound went free.


In this selection, poet-Charles Olson recalls a visit with Pound
shortly after he entered Saint Elizabeths. Pound complains about the
medical cross-examination by resident psychiatrist Kavka. He goes
on to give an example of his own medical scientism in the form of a
scurrilous attack on Jews. Olson reacts by thinking Pound a "fascist
bastard," but persists in the notion that Pound is "sick." The selection
illustrates some absurdities of hospitalization: Pound is placed in a
mental hospital instead of being tried for treason; Kavka persists in
analyzing Pound's mental state; Olson considers his colleague sick;
and Pound himself makes an attack on spurious medical grounds.


In 1956, toward the end of his hospital stay, Pound wrote with
some acuity: "Psychotherapical institutions, so far as is ascertainable,
are run on the supposition that nobody has any nerves, nobody has
any perceptions, and that none of the patients perserves any trace of
logical faculty, not necessarily for syllogisms and trains of thought,
but for immediate perception of cause and effect." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_129379');">[note]</a><div id="_note_129379" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1Gallup, 2:2, p. 320.</div> In what stands as

IN POUND I am confronted by the tragic Double of our day. He is the
demonstration of our duality. In language and form he is as forward,
as much the revolutionist as Lenin. But in social, economic and
political action he is as retrogressive as the Czar.


And then Pound jumped ahead to 1914 and Poland, and
something about they were wise enough to get out. Or he was, I
couldn't quite get it clear. (This date seemed to be important, for
Pound there took a swing at the doctor Kavka, whom, he said, thinks
that all my trouble starts there, 1914, Poland.) <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_130466');">[note]</a><div id="_note_130466" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗Dr. Jerome Kavka does not recall any particular reference to Poland by Pound
except in reference to Kavka's Polish origins on those occasions when Pound felt a
need to strike back at his questioner. Kavka does believe that Pound's bitterness over
the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and the resulting deaths of Gaudier and Hulme
had much to do with his later problems. (Conversation between Dr. Kavka and
Catherine Seelye, December 28, 1973.)</div>


I believe it was here too that Pound said, "I told Potocki, <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_131009');">[note]</a><div id="_note_131009" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">†Count Jerzy Potocki (1889-1961), Polish ambassador to the United States, 1936-1940.
Pound lunched with Potocki while in Washington in 1939.</div> is that
how you pronounce it? I said, Potostcki, and he went on, "I told him
not to trust England." (Familiar?)


Pound's complaint about the doctor served somehow to create the
gayety of the meeting, despite the anti-semitism which mixed itself
into it. For poor Kavka does seem to be scared to death of this Pound
business, and to be handling it in an absurd way because of his fear
and uncertainty. God knows it is causing Pound a good deal of what
I'm sure is unnecessary pain. He says Kavka keeps pounding
questions at him .... and punched his fist against the wall of his
other hand to illustrate the effect. He says he wakes up the following
morning exhausted from trying to think back and work out the
answers to his questions.


I tried to get him to take Kavka less seriously, telling Pound K is
frightened to death, not of him as so much, as of the fact it is the Ezra

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At this Pound says, I never knew a doctor less scientific. If they
want to examine me, why don't they give me some scientist, I
wouldn't mind. He merely acts like a goddamn bureaucrat. But this
intolerable questioning. Good god, what the hell, what the hell
difference does it make what I was reading in 1902! (At this point
Pound just continued to swear, and wondering if there was any "lady"
in the next cubicle, saying he wouldn't want to shock them, he jumps
up and looks around the corner, and finding none, continues to let it
rip.


"With ANTISEMITE spread all over the front page of PM, you
can't expect much else," he said, alluding to K, who was born Jonah
Kafka, and is now Jerome Kavka, <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_133046');">[note]</a><div id="_note_133046" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗Max Brod, in <i>Franz Kafka; Eine Biographie</i>, points out that Kavka is the correct
spelling of this name.</div> as he told me when I gave him
Pound's <i>Kulch and Cantos</i>--. (At that time K said, it hadn't made
any impression on EP when he had learned his name was Kafka.)


Pound then followed up, "The other doctor I didn't mind." He
meant Tiny, who had been in charge that one Sunday CC had visited.
Tiny Ziman. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_133500');">[note]</a><div id="_note_133500" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">†Dr. Edmund Ziman "was called Tiny because he was a very portly man resembling to
some extent one of his close personal friends, Zero Mostel. He had a great sense of
humor and was most articulate." Letter to Catherine Seelye from Jerome Kavka,

ceremonies in a night club, and had some experience with people. But
that K was just a kid. Told him I had tried to get Tiny to bring K and
me together informally. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_134009');">[note]</a><div id="_note_134009" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">††Olson invited Kavka to dinner on January 4, 1946 (the day of Olson's first visit

backed away from me. Probably K is also scared of that s.o.b.
Griffin,§ who is his boss.


Pound said, "They (meaning jews) were nice to me at the DDC <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_134480');">[note]</a><div id="_note_134480" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗∗DTC. Disciplinary Training Center, Mediterranean Theater of Operations USA,
near Pisa.</div>(jail?)."


"I guess the definition of a lunatic is a man surrounded by them."


He was quiet for a minute, working his forehead, when he started
out, talking down and away toward the window to his right and my
left: "There was a Jew, in London, Obermeyer, a doctor of
comparative.....of the endocrines, and I used to ask him what is

I record it, but here as elsewhere, it is impossible to give a true
impression. For at any given point, always, there is the presence of the
seriousness of the man. Even in his sickest and most evil moments. He
is always a man at work, examining, examining. Here, for example,
on the one hand he is attacking K as a Jew, when the truth is K is
making the mistakes of any young man, and Pound is god damned
well lucky it is K and not the monster Griffin who is questioning him,
is in charge. I could not help feeling during this whole line of Pound's,
how it was precisely the Jews around him here and in the DDC <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_136428');">[note]</a><div id="_note_136428" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗Ibid.</div> who
gave him some warmth and help, how it was through Tiny and K that
I had got drawers issued to him, how it was K who at least had the
curiosity to read his verse, and that K, in Chicago, when the
bookstores said, they wouldn't carry the books of a fascist, objected
and damn well told them that was the same as burning books, and
plain out and out fascist.

13: A Need to Disrupt the Lives of Others
[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Reverend Herbert Callender tried to put Mayor
Wagner of New York City under citizen's arrest for
permitting racial bias in the construction of city housing projects,
Callender was arrested and sent to Bellevue Hospital for "mental
observation" (<i>The New York Times</i>, July, 16, 1964, page 12).


Psychiatrist Robert Coles presents a similar case. He heard a
southern judge send a young black civil rights activist to a state
mental hospital for observation and evaluation of "possible
delinquent and sociopathic trends." The victim describes his
treatment, and Dr. Coles comments on the episode.


"IT'S QUITE a setup they've got. We protest our inability to vote, to go
into a movie or restaurant everyone else uses, and they call us crazy,
and send us away to be looked over by psychiatrists and psychologists
and social workers and all the rest of them. The questions I've had put
at me since I've been here! Were you a <i>loner</i> when you were a boy?
Did people consider you <i>rebellious?</i> Were you <i>popular</i> or <i>unpopular</i>
as a child? When you were younger did you have trouble <i>taking
orders</i> from your parents or your teachers? Did your mother
<i>discipline</i> you firmly, or did she more or less let you do as you please?
And on and on they go, one question after another, and none of them
very subtle.


"The guy doing the questioning told me he is a doctor, a
psychiatrist, and I asked him why he wasn't interested in <i>what</i> I've
done, and the <i>objective reasons</i> I've acted as I have. But he said he

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Soon you just slip into the whole scene. I mean, you stop noticing
all the assumptions a guy like that constantly makes, and you simply
try to answer him as best you can. And anyway, if you protest and tell
him off, tell him what you think is implicit in his questions and his
whole way of thinking, he's not going to take your argument
seriously; he's going to go after <i>you</i>--and call you ‘hostile’ and
‘defensive’ and full of ‘problems’ and all the rest. He as much as told
me so, that doctor did. He said a lot was going on inside my mind, and
until I found out what ‘really’ was prompting some of my ‘behavior,’
I'd probably continue what I've been doing. He told me he was going
to recommend to the court that I not be sent to jail. He said I needed
treatment--but he was worried that I would be ‘resistant’ to it, and
that would be ‘too bad’ for me, and later I would be sorry."


The youth then pointed out to me [Robert Coles] what I hope is
obvious: the smug, self-righteous arrogance he had met up with, the
pejorative use of psychiatric terminology, the limitless display of self-satisfaction
and condescension, the essentially illogical and
totalitarian nature of a mode of thought that claims to have the
authority to decide who has a right even to discuss certain matters,

14: Force and Fraud
[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the course of an absurd series of mix-ups and delays, a
suicidal woman becomes so angry that her depression
subsides.


CONCERN FOR the rights of the mentally ill has often taken the form of
social and legal action to release patients from mental hospitals. In
fact, the community mental health center movement is based on this
idea. However, prejudice against inpatient care and the limited
supply of hospital beds have distorted diagnosis and treatment. In
some communities it seems impossible to hospitalize a person unless
he tries to kill himself or another person in front of a worker at the
local receiving hospital.


Clearly it is time to extend the rights of the mentally ill to include
the right to hospitalization for psychiatric problems for those who
need it. Although the mental health professions have rightly been
opposed to long-term hospitalization as a custodial mechanism--
rather than a treatment modality--they must not abandon the whole
idea of hospitalization.


The following account of an attempt to get one patient admitted to
a mental hospital illustrates the insanity in the mental health system.
This incident, which is typical, took place in a ten-hour period
between 4 P.M. and 2 P.M. one weekday night in 1974 in a
metropolitan community of 1.2 million persons.


At 4 P.M. on Monday, Mrs. P called her caseworker, Mrs. L, at the
family service agency. She said she was depressed, had attempted
suicide three days earlier by taking barbiturates and alcohol, and saw

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Mrs. L arrived at Mrs. P's home, all the burners of the gas
stove were on and the windows were closed. She was greeted by a slap
across the face from Mrs. P followed by an embrace. It took five
hours to convince this acutely suicidal woman that, because no family
or friends were available to care for her, hospitalization was the
necessary form of treatment. Mrs. P finally agreed to hospitalization,
and with additional intervention by Mr. J, Mrs. Land Mrs. P went to
the hospital. Mr. J kept in touch with Mrs. L and supported her
efforts. After arranging for return transportation for Mrs. L, he left
for the hospital.


When Mr. J arrived at the hospital, Mrs. L informed him that no
beds were available, despite information to the contrary twenty
minutes earlier. He met with the resident psychiatrist who confirmed
that no beds were available and stated he believed Mrs. P definitely
required hospitalization because of the severity of her depression.


The director of social services, who was still at the hospital,
explained that the available beds had been taken by three unexpected
patients who had just been readmitted. She said that the only hope of
hospitalization was at the county hospital, which has both a crisis
intervention facility and an inpatient psychiatric institute. The other
private psychiatric hospital in the community was filled.


Mrs. P refused to go to the county hospital because she had had a
previous bad experience there. In an attempt to persuade her, Mr. J
and Mrs. L enlisted the aid of a private psychiatrist affiliated with the
hospital who agreed to talk with her. During the discussion between
Mr. J, Mrs. L, and the psychiatrist, it was obvious that the psychiatrist
thought Mrs. L was the patient. When this misunderstanding
was corrected, a hospital aide tried to lock the three in the
interviewing area.


The consultation and second psychiatric interview were unsuccessful.
Mrs. P still refused to go to the county hospital
voluntarily. The psychiatrist advised Mrs. L that Mrs. P would have
to be an involuntary admission and should be told that she would be
taken to the county hospital by the police if she continued to refuse.
When Mrs. P refused again, Mrs. L called the police.


However, an involuntary admission can be arranged on the basis of
an ex parte order only during the day. At night two physicians must

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although the police are not required to help transfer a patient to a
receiving facility, it was fortunate that three policemen were already
at the hospital with a patient they had apprehended on an ex parte
order. After Mr. J and Mrs. L pleaded with them, the police sergeant
agreed to take Mrs. P to the county hospital emergency room, ten
blocks away. A resident in psychiatry who knew someone at the
county hospital discovered that a staff bed was available and reserved
it for Mrs. P. The instructions were to go to the emergency room and
tell the admitting nurse the staff bed was reserved.


The policemen forcibly took Mrs. P to the emergency room. They
were not permitted to stay with her because they had no order from
the court and had to return to their prisoner at the private hospital.
After a thirty-minute wait in the emergency room, where there were a
variety of incidents including a woman trying to defecate into the
water fountain, Mr. J and Mrs. L were told that the psychiatric staff
could not do an intake on Mrs. P for over one hour until the crisis
clinic had closed. They were also told that no one knew anything
about a bed and that they should wait and be patient. Needless to say,
Mrs. P was quite agitated. However, signs everywhere indicated "We
Care."


Mr. J called the administrative nurse at the psychiatric clinic and
discovered that she knew of a waiting bed. She gave him directions
for walking through the labyrinth of halls, including an open surgical
area, to get to the crisis intervention center. On a bulletin board in the
waiting room, in full view of the public, was a list of the names and
appointment dates of patients as well as three memoranda listing
patients who were in an antipsychotic medication research project
and instructions to staff about these patients--an appalling violation
of patients' rights to confidentiality.


Mrs. P would not cooperate at all during the intake interview with
the social worker. The social worker then interviewed our counselor
and concluded that Mrs. P might be able to have a psychiatric
interview. While waiting for the psychiatrist, the counselor was asked
to respond to a long research schedule on behalf of Mrs. P. The
schedule had nothing to do with the evaluation, diagnosis, or
treatment of Mrs. P. While waiting for the psychiatrist, Mr. J and
Mrs. L also discovered that although a bed was arranged for through

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After a ten-minute psychiatric evaluation, the psychiatrist said he
did not believe that Mrs. P was a serious case. He thought her anger
had been sufficiently elevated to decrease her acute depression and
that she could go home, even though there were no supports for her.
Mr. J and Mrs. L were able to convince him that Mrs. P did indeed
need to be hospitalized. Of course, a potential patient rarely has
knowledgeable professionals to serve as advocates in the intake
process.


At 1:00 A.M. two male psychiatric aides came to take Mrs. P to the
psychiatric floor, along with a man in his underwear who had been
brought in by the police and one other admission. Mrs. P refused to
go and the aides were ready to put her in restraints. At first she said, "I
don't want to go with that guy in his underpants." She finally said,
"Oh, what the hell!" and left with the aides. After a painful night of
hospitalization and confirmation of her need for continued
hospitalization by three psychiatrists, she was released the next
morning. Before leaving the hospital, she called Mrs. L and said:
"When I get out of here and I get depressed, I am going to kill myself.
There's no help for me."


One can only conclude that the insanity of the system results indeed
in lowering the acute suicidal tendency. That is, in trying simply to get
admitted to the hospital, Mrs. P's anger was so aroused that it
lowered her depression. However, one cannot but believe that there is
a great need to reevaluate the way mental health services are
provided. At the planning level, mental health professionals must
look at how the mental health system works, and more important, at
how it does not work. Resources have to be developed to meet those
in a crisis. One knows of many cases in which a person has an
electrocardiogram during a routine medical examination and the
next day dies of a heart attack. Clearly, the heart attack was not
preventable. However, there are too many cases of people walking
into crisis centers, being given a couple of pills, walking out, and
killing themselves or someone else.


From the client's point of view, mental illness should not have to
beget more mental illness. As Mrs. P said as she walked through the
open surgical area: "I knew that if I was taken here, I would go crazy."
Surrounded, quite literally, by blood and guts, how can a depressed
person not feel this way?


Within the political perspective, those responsible for health care

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus the implications of this experience are clear. Mental health
professionals must take a closer look at resources to insure their
adequacy. However, in the short run, they must look at practices and
procedures with an eye to their impact on the users of service.
Delusional psychosis on the part of those responsible for the
maladministration of mental health services is not a permissible
defense.

15: Too Mentally Ill
[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Having taken his doctorate at the University of
Michigan, psychologist Siebert went to the Menninger
Foundation mental hospital under a fellowship. In his third-person
account, Siebert writes: "He discovered why it is that a person going
into ‘psychotherapy’ reduces his chances of getting better and, at the
request of the Menninger staff, tried to share his insights with them.
Four days later he found himself locked into the back ward of the
local Veterans Administration hospital. He was forced to take mind-dulling
drugs and the word was spread that he had become severely
mentally ill." Though loaded with Thorazine, Siebert soon "escaped."


Here he tells about the deceit that some staff members practice
when it is time for the inmate to go for a court hearing.


IN SOME psychiatric observation wards a person is not told he is being
committed until shortly before the time of his hearing. And then he
may only find out when he is called to the ward office and told to sign
a form which states that he knows about the hearing but does not
wish to attend. If he asks why the hearing is being held he is likely to
be told that the treatment he needs takes many months, is very
expensive, and that the hearing is merely a legal formality which must
be gone through in order to make the state (or federal) government
pay his total hospitalization costs.


It is rarely suggested to a person that he can be present at his
hearing if he wishes. If he asks to attend he may be told: it is such a
routine thing it isn't worth the trip (one court has been found to

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If, on the other hand, a judge asks why the person isn't present, the
judge hears a different story. Typical ones are: the patient desires
commitment and does not want to appear; the patient is so mentally
ill he would not understand what is happening; the patient is so
heavily drugged it would be harmful for him to be moved; the patient
is so disturbed and potentially violent he cannot be safely brought to
court; or the experience of hearing the psychiatric testimony would
cause the patient to become even more mentally ill.

16: Advantage of Force
[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Artaud had undergone treatment for drug addiction in
Switzerland in 1936. A year later, after he created a
ruckus by seeking refuge in a Jesuit college in Ireland, he was sent
back to France "in a state of high exaltation." Aboard ship, he
responded with a menacing gesture to two crew members who rudely
entered his cabin, and the ensuing fight culminated in his arrest.
Because of the Irish incident and the shipboard tumult, the
authorities at the port of Le Havre had him certified insane and
committed to a mental hospital.


For nine years Artaud was confined in institutions, including Villa-Evrard
from 1939 to 1943, where he became delirious in a ward for
drug addicts; and Rodez from 1943 to 1946, where he was given
electroshock. His friends managed to have him released in 1946, but,
thinking he needed watching, they sent him to the mental hospital at
Ivry. There he died of cancer in 1948.


In "The Patients and the Doctors," Artaud protests, "... I
consider/that it's up to the everlastingly sick me/to cure all
doctors/--born doctors by lack of sickness--/and not up to the
doctors ignorant of my dreadful/states of sickness/to impose their
insulintherapy on me,/their health for a worn out world." In the
powerful open letter to mental hospital superintendents that follows,
he disputes the concept of mental illness and decries doctors'
alienation from their captives.


LETTER TO THE MEDICAL DIRECTORS<br />
OF LUNATIC ASYLUMS


GENTLEMEN,


Law and Custom allow you the right to evaluate human minds.
You are supposed to exercise this sovereign, redoubtable jurisdiction

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697851-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We are not surprised to find you unequal to a task for which few are
preordained. But we vigorously protest against the right attributed to
certain men, narrowminded or not, to sanction their investigations
into the domain of the mind with sentences of life imprisonment.


And what imprisonment! We all know--no, it is not widely enough
known--that asylums, far from being <i>asylums</i>, are fearful jails, where
the inmates provide a source of free and useful manpower and where
brutality is the rule, all of which you tolerate. A mental asylum, under
cover of science and justice, is comparable to a barracks, a prison or a
slave colony.


We will not raise the question of arbitrary confinement. This will
save you the trouble of making hasty denials. But we categorically
state that a great number of your inmates, quite mad by official
definition, are also arbitrarily confined. We protest against any
interference with the free development of delirium. It is as legitimate,
as logical as any other sequence of human ideas or acts. The
repression of anti-social reactions is as chimerical as it is unacceptable
in principle. All individual acts are anti-social. Madmen, above
all, are individual victims of social dictatorship. In the name of
individuality which specifically belongs to man, we demand the
liberation of these people convicted of sensibility. For we tell you no
laws are powerful enough to lock up all men who think and act.


Without stressing the perfectly inspired nature of the
manifestations of certain madmen, in so far as we are capable of
appreciating them, we simply affirm that their concept of reality is
absolutely legitimate, as are all the acts resulting from it.


Try and remember <i>that</i> tomorrow morning during your rounds,
