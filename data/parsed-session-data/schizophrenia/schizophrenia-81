<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME] -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum?
<b>PT:</b> Can you prescribe me something that, my, my dick, I mean, I like to get a hard on, and I don't have the money for Viagra.
<b>DR:</b> You don't?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  I mean, I don't.  My insurance -
<b>DR:</b> Does Medicare cover that, or anything?
<b>PT:</b> No, no they don't pay.  Okay, and anyway with this I work 2 days a week, it takes me with Depakote and Geodon it takes me when I wake up a good hour to 2 hours just to sit up.  And sometimes, you know, I got to be to, when, when I work, I got to be at work at 10:00, so it's very difficult for me -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> For me to, uh, function, you know, just function.  So then, I mean, the Seroquel I love.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> The Seroquel doesn't do me no wrong.  That I take 100 during the day and 100 at night before I go to sleep because, uh, that's the only thing that puts me to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm fine with Seroquel, but if you can, is it possible that you can, because the nurse me told to ask you, at in the hospital because that's the only reason I go off of it.  You know, you know, I mean, I go off of it for, for a little while and she calls the hospital.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you get to keep that.
<b>PT:</b> But, uh, is there anyway we can work on something?  You can -
<b>DR:</b> Well, let's take a look and see what alls going on.  Um, so you're complaining of it's hard to get an erection -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Or it's hard to sustain it, or -
<b>PT:</b> Both of them.
<b>DR:</b> It's hard to ejaculate?
<b>PT:</b> It's, well, I, I never have sex, so it's, it's kind of hard -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> To ejaculate.
<b>DR:</b> Is that because your wife doesn't want to, or?
<b>PT:</b> Well, she never wants to.  You know, she's, uh, she's doesn't have any horny bone, horny things in her body.  You know, but I still like to get, I, you know, I, I love the feeling of, you know, being able to get a hard on and have an orgasm.  You know, I -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I'm, I'm addicted to that, and when I can't do it, it destroys me as a man.  You know.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have erections in the morning when you wake up?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes, not all the time, you know, I can't remember, but I remember having a hard on once or sometimes, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I can't say no.  I cannot tell you no, but yes, I remember there was a time.  You know, not every morning because it, in the morning I'm dead.  You know, in the morning, forget about it.  I mean, you know, I probably can take even a Viagra and nothing happens, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, you still on Depakote?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, sir, 1000 mg.
<b>DR:</b> A thousand mg -
<b>PT:</b> And, uh -
<b>DR:</b> You're taking Seroquel 100 at night right?
<b>PT:</b> A 100 in the morning and 100 at night.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> Twice a day.
<b>DR:</b> And Geodon 80 twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> Eighty, well, I'm, you told me I can take all the medication at nighttime [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So are you taking the 2 Geodons at night?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm taking the 2 Geodons.  You know, I, I usually take the Seroquel during the, the days that I'm not working.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know, in a day.  You know, but if I'm working I'll just, like, when I get home I take 100, then I before I go to bed, then I take another 100.  But I love Seroquel, you know, I love Seroquel.
<b>DR:</b> What do you like best about it?
<b>PT:</b> It's, uh, it relax, you know, I can't tell you that it gets you stoned because it doesn't -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But it, like, relaxes me.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, relax, it just a very good feeling.  You know, very, very good feeling I get.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, let's have you hop on the scale, see what you weight today.
<b>PT:</b> I think I gained some weight since the last time.  Wow!
<b>DR:</b> What's it say?
<b>PT:</b> Two ten.  What was I, 195 last time?
<b>DR:</b> You've gone up a little bit there I suppose.
<b>PT:</b> Holy cow!  That's because I've been eat, I've been eating.  In the hospital I ate like crazy.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, let's see.  Yeah -
<b>PT:</b> But you know, she has no reason to call the police on me in the hospital on.  You know, I, she could just say, "Take it", and I would take it to deal with [INAUDIBLE] thing.  You know, she minds because -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> This is where my problem started.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I told her that an alien came to me and told me a few things.  Told me she was my daughter, that she was also my wife, and there are a lot of things that -
<b>DR:</b> What kind of alien?
<b>PT:</b> Well, she looks like a human being.
<b>DR:</b> Alien from another planet.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, no.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> From a, from a, other side of the universe.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> A space opened up [PHYSICIAN NAME] -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And she walked in to my room.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> In the living room.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> This is, this is years ago, okay.  I've seen her one more time besides that time.  But sometimes she communicates with me, sometimes, not all the time.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, but she might just want to talk about aliens.  I tell her that they're going to destroy this world.  You know?
<b>DR:</b> That could be.  Although you know, there's a lot of asteroids and comets out there too.
<b>PT:</b> I know, but they, they tell, no, they believe that the human race is the garbage, the, the, we as humans are the worst that there is in a life form.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> That's what she says.  And she says that I have many daughters, you know, she says I have many daughters and they're all, she says I am the oldest.  The oldest that there is.  Okay, but I don't want to get into that.  You know, I don't want to get into that because that's not important.  All I know is when I tell her that, "Honey, after I die I'm going to come back and get you," you know.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, and you know, you can be with your family and everything else, you know.  She, she goes nuts on me [PHYSICIAN NAME].
<b>DR:</b> Right.  I might have some Viagra samples for you somewhere around.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I'll have to look and see where we got those.  Hold on just a second.
<b>PT:</b> You're going to give me some Seroquel today [PHYSICIAN NAME]?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, just, do you have Seroquel at home?
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm almost, I'm almost out.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well have a seat there, and let me see what I got.  Now, here's also is a patient voucher, it gets you something on the [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You have to mail this in.
<b>PT:</b> For Seroquel?  Thanks [PHYSICIAN NAME].  So are you going to -
<b>DR:</b> Let me see if I got anything here, I may have some.
<b>PT:</b> So you thinking of changing my medicine or, or my [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>DR:</b> Well, we'll talk about it.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> I mean, when I try to quit it, I'm almost breaking my jaw.  My teeth, I already cracked a couple.
<b>DR:</b> When you try to quit what?
<b>PT:</b> Depakote and Geodon.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Um, you know, I, I clench my teeth so bad that I've already broke 2, 2 teeth, and I don't have no money to fix them.
<b>DR:</b> So you get like a tight jaw?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I clench it.
<b>DR:</b> And when do you get that?
<b>PT:</b> All day long.
<b>DR:</b> When you quit taking the medicine?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Let's see.
<b>PT:</b> Oh thanks [PHYSICIAN NAME].  God knows I need it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, there's some for you, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay [PHYSICIAN NAME], thanks.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So you going to, you going to change it or no?
<b>DR:</b> Well, you're saying when you stop the medicine you get a tight jaw, not when you take it?
<b>PT:</b> Not tight jaw, I just keep, you know, what I'm talking about?
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And it goes away, but I always break a couple of tooth, but it's more important for me going under a medication that I can, that I can function if there is a medication out there.
<b>DR:</b> And you don't take anything for your heart, no nitrates -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No nitroglycerin -
<b>PT:</b> No, no.
<b>DR:</b> Nothing like that?
<b>PT:</b> No, no.  I'm, I'm healthy.  That, that they said, um, next time we do a blood test, uh, I want you to check my cholesterol because I remember -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> A long time ago when we did a blood test -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> The doctor told me, uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] -
<b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] usually, but she saw me once after I took the blood test.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And she said that my cholesterol was high.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, did you have any in the hospital?  Did they check your cholesterol?
<b>PT:</b> No, I told her to do that, but she said she can't do that.  She, she told me just do that after I, uh, uh, the next time I take a blood test, go for a blood test.  She just took the blood test, that's it.  Because I told, uh, the black lady -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Yes, uh-huh, yeah, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I told her, can she do that because I wanted to do that.  She said no.  I wish she would have done that because I want to see a doctor in case if I have high cholesterol.
<b>DR:</b> Well, who's your family doctor?
<b>PT:</b> I don't have one.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, you know, you did see, like, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], those guys.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay, okay.
<b>DR:</b> You can follow up with them.  They have an office on [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> All right, I'll just call 411.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So the, um, Seroquel, does that help you to relax at night?
<b>PT:</b> Very much.  I mean, it's the only that puts, if I don't take it -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Even when I stop taking -
<b>DR:</b> We'll say you could take 2 of these then at night if you want.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Even if I stop medication -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I always take the Seroquel.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Okay?  I, I, I have, I have never stopped taking Seroquel.  I always take it, and, uh, it, it really, it's a comfortable 8 hours sleep, you know, comfortable 8 to 10 hours sleep I get.  And I can't do that.  I mean, if I just take Depakote and Geodon I can't fall asleep.
<b>DR:</b> By the way, this thing says, expires [DATE].  They might still honor it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, you can try that.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> So we'll increase the Seroquel a little bit.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> That'll probably help you sleep and relax.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  So 200 mg at night.
<b>DR:</b> Two hundred mg each dose because you're only taking 100 once a day now?
<b>PT:</b> Twice a day.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you're taking it twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so let's, so take the 200 at bedtime.
<b>PT:</b> Just at bedtime?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and if you get nervous during the day you could take an extra 1 -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> During the day.  So we'll give you a little extra for that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So let me get you a different prescription for that one.

<b>DR:</b> I'm going to give you a different one.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  Thanks [PHYSICIAN NAME].  I love you.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, I love you too, okay.  So you're doing pretty well.
<b>PT:</b> I'm doing real well, you know, it just, she goes nuts when I, I mean, I try not talk about my daughter, you know, and my wife, or whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I want her to know that there are aliens, and there's lots -
<b>DR:</b> Well, what's the name of the alien?  Do you have one?
<b>PT:</b> Pardon me?
<b>DR:</b> Do you have a name for that alien?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] is her name.
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER], hm.
<b>PT:</b> I want, I want her to know that there is another side -

<b>DR:</b> It's like a parallel world?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, you know, and, and I, they say I am the one that's going to judge this planet.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I am the one that at the end -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> When I die I will judge this planet.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  That's kind of like what God does, isn't it?
<b>PT:</b> Well, whatever.  But that's what they're saying.  There's no one older than -
<b>DR:</b> Gotcha.
<b>PT:</b> They're saying I'm the oldest.  There's no one older.  And I know it sounds crazy, but she's beautiful.  Beautiful.
<b>DR:</b> Do you wish your wife was more like her?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, I mean, I mean listen [PHYSICIAN NAME], my wife is this mother of my son -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I will, I will never let her go.  Never let her go.  Okay, never.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Even if she divorces me, she's going to be with me after life.  Okay.  I will never let her go.
<b>DR:</b> Got you, are you, by the way, did you quit smoking?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> How much you smoking?
<b>PT:</b> Um, 2 packs a day.
<b>DR:</b> Uh -
<b>PT:</b> I quit for a while, you know, with the, the what was that?  Chantix?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's so easy.
<b>DR:</b> Do you want to try it again?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No?
<b>PT:</b> I enjoy smoking.
<b>DR:</b> You enjoy smoking, but you know, there's a lot of health risks in smoking.  Strokes, heart attacks [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> This is Depakote and Seroquel again.  I mean Geodon and Depakote.
<b>DR:</b> Well, this is what you were discharged from the hospital.  You were on the Geodon twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> The Seroquel we just increased that a little bit.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> So you're not changing my medication?
<b>DR:</b> Well, we're giving you just a little more Seroquel during the day.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  And the Depakote stays the same, and you got the Viagra now.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm stuck with Depakote and Geodon.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know what's nice about Geodon is it keeps your cholesterol under control.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, so stay with it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, the cholesterol tends not go up so much like it does with the Seroquel -
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Can sometimes cause that.
<b>PT:</b> That's the gray one, right?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, by the way, if you worry about your cholesterol, you should really be worried about your smoking because that's got more hazards [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I love smoking.  I don't mind dying.  I'm not, I -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> There's going to be a beautiful life when I -
<b>DR:</b> Then why are you worried about your cholesterol?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I just, yeah, you're right, why?  You're right, beacuse there's a beautiful life after -
<b>DR:</b> I mean, the biggest risk factor is your smoking.
<b>PT:</b> You're right.  Yeah, I don't worry about that.

<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> To want you -

<b>PT:</b> To kill your body because your body is your temple.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Okay?  Your body is your temple.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You don't do that to the body.
<b>DR:</b> Are you hearing any voices?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No, okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, if, if I, if I, if I didn't believe in that [PHYSICIAN NAME] I would be dead tonight.
<b>DR:</b> Got you.
<b>PT:</b> I would take all my medication, one shot if I didn't believe that the body is your temple.  You should respect and honor your body.
<b>DR:</b> Got you.  And so how is your sleep at night?  Can you -
<b>PT:</b> Pardon me?
<b>DR:</b> Do you get 8 hours of sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I get, I get good sleep.
<b>DR:</b> And how's your appetite?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it's pretty good, pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And that's why I gained.  I, you know, in the hospital I was eating like crazy, getting everybody elses food.
<b>DR:</b> Got you.  You're [AGE] now?
<b>PT:</b> I am, getting old.  Feel old.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Oh, that's okay.  You're doing pretty well actually.  Um, could lose a little bit of weight.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> Are you exercising?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I cramp up, you know, even I remember when I was having sex with her.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I get on, she doesn't, only position she knows is layback on her, just lay dead.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> And when I try to pump it -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum
<b>PT:</b> I cramp real bad.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  Where?
<b>PT:</b> Um, my legs, you know, my legs cramp up so bad that I can't, I can't even do it, so I can't have sex even if I tried.  Unless if she gets on top, you know, then I'm fine.
<b>DR:</b> So you're just out of shape.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm getting old, you know.  I mean, I was a great athlete once.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Greatest.  I was the greatest, All State, All Midwest, All American in high school.
<b>DR:</b> If you quit smoking that'll help your endurance.  It'll help your penis too.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to quit smoking.  I really like -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you know -
<b>PT:</b> I, I quit -
<b>DR:</b> That smoking affects the arteries in your penis too.
<b>PT:</b> I don't care.  I mean, [PHYSICIAN NAME] -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I thought you liked sex?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> What do you like better?  Sex or smoking?
<b>PT:</b> I, I like getting my hard on.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't have sex unless if I find a girlfriend, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Are you attractive to your wife?  What do you think?
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME], you want to know something?
<b>DR:</b> Hm?
<b>PT:</b> She bitches at me 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day.  I tell her when I'm on this medication I can't do much, [NAME OTHER].  Especially in the morning time.  She bitches about that.  Then I tell her, "You want me to stop taking it?"  She bitches about that.  And she bitches constantly no matter what I do, what I do.  You know, I mean, but she's a great mother.
<b>DR:</b> And I think the alien that visits you, that's just one of those reminders that your relationship could be perfected in other ways.
<b>PT:</b> No, listen [PHYSICIAN NAME].
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe I have mentioned it to her.  It's been 12 years -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And a couple of times I've been with my daughter.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, in the last 12 years, 12, no, I had 12, 13 years, I've mentioned it to her 3 times.
<b>DR:</b> Got you.
<b>PT:</b> Three times.  I mean, you know, I don't say this to anybody.  Okay?  I don't say this that the human race is going to be ended.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  I don't say that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because that's what's going to happen.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> We are the worst, I mean, they look at America -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> They're looking at America and they're saying, "Oh my God."
<b>DR:</b> There's always room for improvement.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I hope your relationship gets better too.
<b>PT:</b> I love you [PHYSICIAN NAME].
<b>DR:</b> Okay, love you too [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> But there's hope for humanity, though don't, don't worry about that.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Come on up this a way.
