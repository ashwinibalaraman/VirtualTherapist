This truth came home with bier and pall,<br />
I felt it when I sorrowed most:<br />
'T is better to have loved and lost,<br />
Than never to have loved at all.


--WHITTIER.


MY readers must not infer, from the preceding
chapter, that I was an <i>altogether</i> unhappy
girl; for, indeed, such was far from being the
fact. Few persons, I think, possessed a keener
sense of enjoyment, or had brighter hours, than
I, only they were not uniformly so--and unusual
gayety was too frequently followed by melancholy.
I was a passionate lover of music, as I am
still, and was strangely moved by it often to tears,
and at times, too, when such effect was embarrassing.
And, now, the slight knowledge of
it is a <i>real blessing</i>--acting as a sort of safety-valve
to repressed feeling, too deep, often, for
words. So, when my dark days come--for
they <i>do yet come,</i> sometimes--I strike a few
chords, and sing my useless regrets away. And
my attachments were strong and <i>lasting,</i> while
their <i>object</i> remained faithful, not longer.

I have but little reverence for traditions--
<i>simply</i> as <i>traditions</i>. Indeed, a phrenologist told
me once that, instead of a bump, there was a
reverential <i>depression</i> on my head. So, it is
not surprising, that my really sincere expressions,
directly opposite to cherished traditions,
sometimes jar upon sensitive ears, and cause
even looks of pained surprise from those whom
I would not willingly wound.


I do not readily forget! and I make no effort
to <i>forgive</i> injuries--"Let the dead rest."
Why, if the dead have willfully, cruelly
wronged us? Death is our common lot--and
there are sorrows to which, by comparison,
death is a blessing. I think, honestly, I used
to endeavor to shape my life, as regards my
dealings with my fellows, by the "golden rule,"
until forced by experience into changing the
wording (since the substance so often failed
me) to suit my own individuality. And I find
that, doing unto others, as others do, and have
done, unto me, works quite as satisfactorily--
and does <i>not</i> so often give one the heartache,
as the unexpected violation of the original
rule was wont to do. Those who <i>prefer</i> the old
path, however, need not be disturbed by my
departure. And, since faith is so beautiful, I
would be sorry to say one word to disturb any
one possessing it.

When I was married, I sincerely loved my
husband! And my children were my idols--
I almost worshiped them! And, until this
trouble came, I was happier, more contented,
than in all my previous life. I must say <i>trouble</i>,
yet it was not "domestic trouble!" I do not
<i>now,</i> and never <i>have,</i> held my husband responsible
for my affliction, in any <i>intentional</i> manner.
The "domestic trouble phase" was of
recent date. I am glad to have the memory
of a pleasant, comfortable, <i>peaceful home</i>--the
few years I was permitted to enjoy it. And
when comparing, as I am obliged truthfully to
do, my husband as he was <i>then</i> (thoughtful and
careful of my comfort ever), <i>with the man</i> who,
only a few months since, refused me even the
privilege of <i>seeing</i> our children, and brutally
bade me "go to the Knox county <i>poor-house</i> for
support," rather than into his house and the
society of our children, it is small wonder that
I feel I have but <i>recently</i> formed his real acquaintance--
and the fact that, for five years or
more, I thought my husband a <i>gentleman,</i> must
be sadly laid away among other kindred "delusions."
Why was I not, after such a heartless
repulse, driven back into the shadow--worse
than death--from which I had so recently
emerged? "It was not to be." The last <i>voluntary</i>
act of my life--before the blow came--was for

When fully awake, I recognized my condition!
For the second time within the year I
was <i>completely helpless</i> from "nervous prostration!"
And, startling as a flash of lightning
in a clear sky, came the <i>revelation,</i> This <i>"something,"</i>
that had been with me <i>all my life</i>,
walking by my side, invisible, but <i>felt</i> even in
my <i>happiest moments,</i> haunting me and threatening
to overwhelm me at some unexpected,
happy moment, had come! and it was <i>insanity!</i>


And <i>then</i> it was, as has so heartlessly been
said of me, "I deliberately folded my hands,
and announced my intention of being sick."
My hands <i>were</i> folded! my work taken <i>out</i> of
<i>them!</i> But it was not <i>I</i> did it! They were

I know I <i>once</i> had faith in His promises.
"Let not your hearts be troubled; ye believe
in God, believe also in me," was to my troubled,
but trusting soul, as "the shadow of a great
rock in a weary land." As I prepared myself
for church on the above-mentioned Sunday
morning, every breath was a prayer for help
or comfort. But no comfort came! The sermon,
and walk home, seemed a confused and
troubled dream! Until just as we reached
home, my little son, whom I had taken with
me, stepped forward to open the gate, and said,

Does any <i>mother</i> doubt that I <i>love</i> my children?
I was with them such a <i>little while!</i>
And I think I can recall more of their sweet,

"This is truth, the poet sings,
That a sorrow's crown of sorrows,
Is remembering happier things,"


I am glad <i>my</i> memory was <i>not</i> blotted out, my
memories are <i>not all bitter!</i> And yet, upon
this child's account, I am branded, upon the
hospital records, with a name worse than that
of murderess! It is shameful and cruel in the
extreme, that I am recorded "homicidal."
Suicidal I <i>was,</i> in thought and intention, for
years! But no thought of <i>murder</i> was in my
heart when attempting the deed that consigned
me to the "asylum for the insane." On the
contrary, it was an effort to <i>save</i> my child from
the fearful (possible) heritage of <i>insanity</i>!
And my desperation was intensified by cruel
insinuation, and vile, abusive taunts, from
those surrounding me, whose public professions
were of sympathy, but whose private acts were
those of <i>fiends!</i> I reasoned thus (for insane
persons <i>do</i> reason, sometimes fearfully to the
