<b>DR:</b> So tell me what's happening, [PATIENT NAME].  What's, what kind of difficulties you're having.
<b>PT:</b> I'm getting to be very homicidal.
<b>DR:</b> Um.  What's -
<b>PT:</b> I had a machete to this Mexican's knife, uh, his throat yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> What's that?
<b>PT:</b> I had a machete knife.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> To this Mexican's throat yesterday.  I was going to cut his head off and send it to his grandma.
<b>DR:</b> What's the matter?  What happened?
<b>PT:</b> He started on me.
<b>DR:</b> What, what was he -
<b>PT:</b> He started chucking rocks at me.  I was sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette.  He started running his mouth on my boy and I told him to shut the fuck up.
<b>DR:</b> Is he your neighbor or something?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's across the street from me.  I told him to shut the fuck up about my boy, who's, he -
<b>DR:</b> What was he saying?
<b>PT:</b> He said my boy was gay and stuff like that.  And that my boy was a slum landlord, and my boy was going to get jumped when he comes up there for his money and stuff.  And I was like, if you want to jump somebody, come and jump me, motherfucker.  And he was like, he said, "I got heat for niggers like you."  I said, oh, you want to bring a weapon in it.  And I went in the house, grabbed my machete and went across the street and put it to his throat.
<b>DR:</b> So what happened then?
<b>PT:</b> Cops were called.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And the cops told me to leave him alone.  They took him inside.
<b>DR:</b> They didn't press charges?
<b>PT:</b> No.  He was too scared to press charges on me.
<b>DR:</b> No, the police didn't press charges?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Before the cops got there, I told [NAME OTHER], that was his name, the Mexican.  I told him, I said -
<b>DR:</b> That sounds like an American name.
<b>PT:</b> I said if you, uh, well, his name's something else.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But they call him [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But, um, I told him if you press charges on me, when I get out, I'll burn your house down with your whole family in it.
<b>DR:</b> So you threatened him?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> So he, you scared him, or?
<b>PT:</b> I scared him, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So what -
<b>PT:</b> And I told the cops if they arrest me, they're going to arrest me for something better than what, what they came for.
<b>DR:</b> Um.  So when did this all happen?
<b>PT:</b> Yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> Your girlfriend was there?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And what did she say?
<b>PT:</b> She told me to calm down and get in the house.
<b>DR:</b> Um.  So you had any episodes like this before?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, long, long, long, long, long time ago.
<b>DR:</b> So you're getting a little manic?
<b>PT:</b> I'm getting very homicidal where I want to kill people.
<b>DR:</b> Where you're getting angry and paranoid and agitated?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Sounds like a manic episode to me.  Are you getting like a high, hyper, or?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping at night?
<b>PT:</b> Um, off and on.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> I sleep more during the daytime.  Like I said, I could sleep a whole day away, if not two days.
<b>DR:</b> So some days you sleep a lot, and some days you don't sleep at all?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you go through these mood swings?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Some days you're high, some days you're down?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um.  So you have anything else troubling you, like any, like voices lately?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So when was the last time you heard any voices?
<b>PT:</b> Like 7 or 8 years ago.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Used to get voices before?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But lately you haven't heard any voices?
<b>PT:</b> No.  And I tried to cut myself, too.
<b>DR:</b> When?
<b>PT:</b> Day before yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> So what was troubling you?
<b>PT:</b> Me and my girlfriend was fighting, and she broke up with me.
<b>DR:</b> She did?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> When?
<b>PT:</b> The day before yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> And then what happened?
<b>PT:</b> I went out, grabbed a knife, and was going to commit suicide because she broke up with me.
<b>DR:</b> Um, and then you, then what happened?  What stopped you?
<b>PT:</b> I cut my wrist.
<b>DR:</b> Let me see?  I don't see much of anything there.
<b>PT:</b> Not my wrist.  I meant, I went to cut myself there, because I was going to go around my whole hand, I was going to cut my whole hand off because they say that's not repairable.
<b>DR:</b> I don't even see it.
<b>PT:</b> Right there.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.  So made a small, uh, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> It's scarred.  But [NAME OTHER] hit me in the side of my head without me seeing her, and when she hit me I fell to the ground, and she got the knife off of me.
<b>DR:</b> She was there?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you, did you go to hospital or anything after that?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You, didn't ask you to go to the hospital?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Your girlfriend wasn't concerned?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, she wanted me to go.  She wanted me to go sign myself on 5, and I told her no.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> That I was fine.
<b>DR:</b> So your mood swings are up and down, back and forth?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And pretty radical, kind of homicidal, suicidal.
<b>PT:</b> Lately they have been homicidal more than anything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You think you should be in the hospital?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> If you're homicidal, that's not a good sign, again.
<b>PT:</b> I'd just be homicidal in the hospital, too.
<b>DR:</b> They can make some changes in your medication to adjust things to get you stable.  Be more stable and -
<b>PT:</b> I don't feel I need to be in the hospital, though.  As of right now.  I can write up a paper if you want me to, that if I feel any homicide thoughts or suicide thoughts I'll call crisis.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you've given you me your word that you'll, um, take action if there's things get worse in any way?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  That's good.  What about the Abilify?  You're not taking Abilify any more?
<b>PT:</b> No.  We quit the Abilify.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe we need to get back on that.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> It seems like you're getting worse since we started that.
<b>PT:</b> No.  The Abilify wasn't working.
<b>DR:</b> So you want to take something else, like something?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> For mood stabilizing.
<b>PT:</b> My brother takes Adderall, and he said when he takes his Adderall, he said he's more alert and up and ready to do something.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  But your problem is not that.  You are suicidal and homicidal.
<b>PT:</b> It's not always that.
<b>DR:</b> People commit suicide -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but my problem also is that I sleep the days away.  I don't want to do nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but people who are suicidal and homicidal cannot take Adderall.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> That can, makes them even more psychotic and more homicidal.
<b>PT:</b> What about Xanax?
<b>DR:</b> No.  That may not, uh, they're not going to cure your homicidal, suicidal mood swings.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You need a mood stabilizer.  That's what we need to get you on, a mood stabilizer.
<b>PT:</b> I thought the Prozac was a mood stabilizer.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's like, it's just an antidepressant.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> But sometimes, actually it doesn't work and actually can make it worse.  So which medication you haven't filled yet?
<b>PT:</b> The one that you prescribed me the last time.  Because I ain't got no way to fill it, because I don't drive.
<b>DR:</b> Um.  The Neurontin?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Have you already been on Depakote?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I don't want on that.  It made me gain too much weight.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Have you already been on Geodon?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Let's try that.  That's a good mood stabilizer.  It doesn't cause weight gain, it's good for, uh, mood stability.
<b>PT:</b> I lost weight.  I lost 17 pounds.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So I'll get you on, uh, Geodon as a mood stabilizer.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> Because it's also an antipsychotic.  It stops from many paranoia, racing thoughts, voices and mood swings.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> It gives you energy, also, a little bit.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> So you're back with your girlfriend?  Because I see you both together here, right?
<b>PT:</b> Um, we live together, but we're not back together.
<b>DR:</b> You're not to -
<b>PT:</b> I told her we'll get back together, we'll live as friends right now, but we'll get back together once I get on my medicine, the right medicine for me, I complete my anger management classes, I complete my parenting classes and I clear my name.
<b>DR:</b> So when is your, you're on probation right now?
<b>PT:</b> I'm on house arrest.
<b>DR:</b> House arrest.  Since when?
<b>PT:</b> I've been on house arrest.
<b>DR:</b> For how long?  A couple of months?
<b>PT:</b> I've been on it for 9 months, already, almost.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b> On the [DATE] of this month it will be 9 months.  I get off on [DATE] of this month.
<b>DR:</b> You're done?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And then I start 9 months on state parole.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  How old are you, [AGE]?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE].  I was put away since I was, like, [AGE], up until the age of [AGE].  And then from [AGE] up until the age of [AGE], I've been in and out of jail.
<b>DR:</b> In and out of jail?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um.  Do you have medical assistance?
<b>PT:</b> I have Gateway.
<b>DR:</b> They pay for your medications?
<b>PT:</b> All, except for like a buck or 2.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  So what's your daily routine now, besides being on house arrest?  What are, how do you?
<b>PT:</b> All I can really do is sit on my porch for air, and then I got digital cable, I watch TV.  I listen to the radio.  I fix up my apartment, and I'm trying to get a computer.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  You're in a shop, in a shopping mood?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  If, if, if I get a computer, I'm going to go for my GED online.  And then once I get my GED online, I'm going to work with handicapped adults.
<b>DR:</b> Um?
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to enroll in ITT Tech.
<b>DR:</b> You think you can do all that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I want to quit SSI.
<b>DR:</b> You think you can, uh, uh, get a job and function in a job like situation?
<b>PT:</b> I think I can, if it's handicapped adults.
<b>DR:</b> So, did you ever work in any kind of a workshop, or -
<b>PT:</b> Because, um, when I lived off [DEIDENTIFIED] before, I took care of my five neighbors, and they were older women.  I cleaned their house, I showered them, I made sure they took their medicine.  I fed them, I grocery shopped for them.  I did it all.
<b>DR:</b> So, when you're happy you do better?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And when you're depressed, you have no motivation, no energy to do things.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you have mood swings?
<b>PT:</b> Very much so.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> One minute I can be talking to you, and the next minute, not saying I would, but then next minute I could be tooken up this desk and throwing it through the window.
<b>DR:</b> So you can be happy one minute, and agitated next minute.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And down in the dumps another minute.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So mood is all over the map.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So, any, pro, anything kind of provokes these mood changes, or it come on their own?
<b>PT:</b> It just comes on its own, usually.  Like, if somebody says something that pisses me off.
<b>DR:</b> Even if somebody's not saying anything, do you get, still have these mood swings?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Especially if they're whispering, because I think they're whispering about me.
<b>DR:</b> So you think that people are talking about you, and -
<b>PT:</b> I always think people are out to get me and they're talking about me.
<b>DR:</b> So you have a lot of paranoia, and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You used to hear voices at one time?
<b>PT:</b> I used to, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So when was the last time you heard voices?  So a long time back, many years ago?
<b>PT:</b> A long time ago.  Like, 6 or 7 years ago.
<b>DR:</b> How old were you at the time?  Like [AGE], [AGE]?
<b>PT:</b> Something like that, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you've been in and out of the hospital, psychiatric hospital?
<b>PT:</b> Hospital, psych hospitals, 5th floor, boys' homes.
<b>DR:</b> When was the last, when was the last time you were in any psych hospitals?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't even remember.
<b>DR:</b> Anything recently?  In the last 6 months?
<b>PT:</b> No, not recently.  Not in the 6 months.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you're not eating well now?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Because my depression kicks in, then I don't want to eat at all.
<b>DR:</b> So you lost weight recently?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I lost 17 pounds within a week and a half.
<b>DR:</b> Um.  Are you able to read any books or anything you can enjoy?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Can you read and write well?
<b>PT:</b> I can read.  I can't write well.
<b>DR:</b> So what are your future plans?
<b>PT:</b> To work with handicapped adults.
<b>DR:</b> So when did you get into this mood to do that?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I seen it on TV and it looked like something I'd enjoy doing.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  Any alcohol or drugs now?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> What?
<b>PT:</b> I got drunk the other day, and I smoked marijuana.
<b>DR:</b> So then what happened then?  Probation, uh -
<b>PT:</b> I told my house arrest officer about it, and he's the one that told me to come up here today to go to counseling with [NAME OTHER].  And he said to make it a drug assessment, with drug and alcohol.  [DEIDENTIFIED] drug and alcohol, and see if they're going to put me in outpatient rehab or inpatient rehab.
<b>DR:</b> So, then, your probation officer knows about it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So he didn't violate you and put you back in jail?
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um.
<b>DR:</b> How come?
<b>PT:</b> Because I've been doing so good, he said.
<b>DR:</b> You are?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> How can you say that?  You're having all these problems with suicidal, homicidal.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't tell him about the suicidal and homicidal.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, uh, when did you get drunk?  Like at home or outside?
<b>PT:</b> I got drunk at home.
<b>DR:</b> So who brought the alcohol in home?
<b>PT:</b> My buddy, [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  And what about drugs?
<b>PT:</b> Same thing.
<b>DR:</b> Marijuana?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.  [NAME OTHER] brought it.
<b>DR:</b> So -
<b>PT:</b> And then this guy, [NAME OTHER], brought some, uh, crack over, but I wouldn't smoke it.  I smacked it out of his hand.
<b>DR:</b> Well, why do you, why do you allow people like that to come in?
<b>PT:</b> He ain't allowed to come back, because I don't smoke crack, I smoke weed.
<b>DR:</b> But even weed is a danger.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but Obama's making weed legal.
<b>DR:</b> I don't think, not for recreational use.  It's for medical use.  Not for people who want to get high on it.
<b>PT:</b> I don't see why he wouldn't.
<b>DR:</b> Because, uh, I don't think society would accept it.
<b>PT:</b> Why not?  Because you can make a lot of money off of weed.
<b>DR:</b> No, I don't think, um, he would stand another election and win if he makes that.  So you're into weed?  So your probation officer knows about it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm honest with him.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But honest doesn't mean that you're allowed to do that while you're on probation and -
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> So all this time he knows about it and didn't do anything about it?
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um.  I got warnings.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> Like, I think I got two written warnings, now.  "Next time," he said, "I'm going to have to put you in jail."
<b>DR:</b> So you're jeopardizing your freedom if you get high.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So what do you make of that?
<b>PT:</b> It's stupid.
<b>DR:</b> It's kind of, so the trends show how addicted you are, that you want to do that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And the, in the morning, I don't know what this is, but I used to smoke crack really bad.  And in the mornings, I started craving it, licking my lips and stuff, and I'd taste the crack on my lips.  But I haven't been smoking crack for 6, 7 years, now.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But I guess it's still an addiction.  Once you're addicted, you're always addicted to some substances, right?
<b>PT:</b> Same with my heroin addict.  I used to be a heroin addict, shooting up.  I crave heroine at times.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't give in on my cravings, though.
<b>DR:</b> But marijuana and alcohol, you do.
<b>PT:</b> Marijuana and alcohol is the, my weakness.
<b>DR:</b> So you're giving in to those weaknesses.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Especially if you have mental illness and you're taking medication, probably you stop -
<b>PT:</b> I haven't taken my medication because I've been drinking and smoking weed.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So it's not, uh, easy to treat somebody who's not taking their medication and drinking and using drugs.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I quit now.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you're not going to do that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm going to ask the lady, tomorrow, she'll put me in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you're going to go to drug and alcohol assessment, uh, clinic, and, uh, okay.  That's a good idea.  But I think you need to be on a mood stabilizer like Geodon.  It will keep you from having these paranoid thoughts, violent thoughts, homicidal, suicidal feelings, depressed feelings, and help you with your mood.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Any thoughts of hurting your family, or any thoughts of hurting your girlfriend, or ex girlfriend?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I told her I was going to snap her neck the one day.
<b>DR:</b> Um.  And what happened then?
<b>PT:</b> She called the cops on me.
<b>DR:</b> And?
<b>PT:</b> They asked me if I said that.  I said no.
<b>DR:</b> So they didn't believe her.
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um.
<b>DR:</b> But there's, you're still together?
<b>PT:</b> No, we ain't together.  We just live together.
<b>DR:</b> When?  That's the same, under the same roof.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  As friends.
<b>DR:</b> So you don't get into arguments and fights like you used to?
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um.
<b>DR:</b> So how long -
<b>PT:</b> So when I'm with her, she tries to control me.
<b>DR:</b> How long have you been together?
<b>PT:</b> She thinks she owns me when we're together.  We've been together 7 years.
<b>DR:</b> So, you think, you're going to end this and move on with your life?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  I'm moving down south once I get off of everything.  I'm moving to North Carolina.
<b>DR:</b> So who's there?
<b>PT:</b> Huh?  A buddy of mine.  He said if I come down there, he'll start me off.  He owns his own business, he'll start me off at 20 bucks an hour.
<b>DR:</b> So where were you in treatment before you came here?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> So how long were you in treatment at [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Since I was little.
<b>DR:</b> So they know you very well there?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So who was your doctor, psychiatrist, or?
<b>PT:</b> Doctor down there was [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  And I had [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] before.  And, um, psychologist was, uh, [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> So who was your therapist?
<b>PT:</b> That's what I mean, my therapist was [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> So they diagnosed you as bipolar or <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> or what?
<b>PT:</b> They just diagnosed me as bipolar and ADHD.
<b>DR:</b> When you were younger?
<b>PT:</b> They didn't, they didn't do what they were supposed to down there.  They didn't go through my whole thing, they didn't sit there and let me talk to them.  They'd give me a time limit.  Once my time was up, I had to leave, no matter if I was done talking or not.
<b>DR:</b> But a therapist takes you, gives you more time.  Almost 45 minutes to an hour or so.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Therapist gives me 45 minutes to an hour.
<b>DR:</b> Psychiatrists do too.  I think our doctors, 10, 15 minutes is the max they can give you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, you're going to take the Geodon if I prescribe it to you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Fine.  I think it might help you, it might be the cure -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> For your mood swings, your paranoia -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Your agitation.  Because the way it's going now, you're going to be in a big mess -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If you don't get this thing taken care of.
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] wasn't taking her medicine, either, at first.  Since she's been coming here -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> She's been getting her medicine, bringing it home, flushing it down the toilet.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So what's the point?
<b>PT:</b> I told her, what's the point of getting your medicine, then?  Just tell them you don't want to see the doctor no more.
<b>DR:</b> So why are you, why you and she wasting their, your time coming here, not taking medications, not doing anything we recommend?
<b>PT:</b> That's what I told her.  I said, "Why you wasting their time?"
<b>DR:</b> What is the game plan?  What is the plan?
<b>PT:</b> That's what I said.  "Why are you wasting their time?"
<b>DR:</b> I mean, yourself, too.  You're not taking medication, either, you said.
<b>PT:</b> I don't need, to haven't took mine for three days.
<b>DR:</b> Three days.  So you're more consistent, then?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She hasn't took hers since she's been here.  But she says she's going to start taking hers, because I told her if she don't, I'm, I'm out of the house, I'm leaving state and I'll never talk to her again.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean, but you broke up with her anyway, you're not part of her -
<b>PT:</b> No.  I'm her friend, though.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but -
<b>PT:</b> She wants me to stay her friend.  If she doesn't do what I tell her to do, then I won't be her friend.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you're trying to guide her, and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, let's try the Geodon.  Let me get you some samples.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Because definitely you need something more like a mood stabilizer and an anti-psychotic.
<b>PT:</b> All right.  And how many times a day do I take the Geodon?
<b>DR:</b> Forty mg twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> All right.  Is there a certain time of day?
<b>DR:</b> No, but they recommend you take in the morning and, uh, with food, and the evening with supper.  So they recommend to have it with breakfast and supper.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> That way it gets absorbed better, and -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Works better.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But if you're having any bad thoughts of wanting to hurt yourself or others, immediately seek hospitalization.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> And also go for the drug and alcohol assessment for them to put you in rehab.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You need it, because you don't want to jeopardize your freedom and, and going to jail and all that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> I'll see you back in 4 weeks, and see how it's going.
<b>PT:</b> You didn't give me my samples.
<b>DR:</b> And I, I looked for it.  They didn't have any 40 mg dose.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> So get the prescription.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Straight from the pharmacy.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> I'll see you in 4 weeks.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
