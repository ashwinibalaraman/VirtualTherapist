BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> And, you were telling me you want to sort out your medications today.  Have a seat.  Let me move this seat around so there is a little bit more comfortable.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And you can park your walker right there.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Have you been going to work?
<b>PT:</b> No.  They finally told me I have to stay back.
<b>DR:</b> You have to stay back?  How come?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I was crying.
<b>DR:</b> You were tired?
<b>PT:</b> I was crying.
<b>DR:</b> You were crying?  Why?
<b>PT:</b> Because, uh, my blood pressure went up.
<b>DR:</b> Your blood pressure was up?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Let me see if the, uh, if your primary doctor wrote anything in your chart about that.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I'm not sure who is, uh, who is knocking, but I want to see to have some privacy.  Yeah, it doesn't look like it's anybody who needs to come in right away.
<b>PT:</b> It's only me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, because we want a private place where we could meet.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] going to the hospital again.  It doesn't help me.  The medicine doesn't help.
<b>DR:</b> The medicine doesn't help?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> I, I thought that the Geodon was agreeing with you very well.
<b>PT:</b> No, it doesn't help, the doc, when the doctor won't give me new medicine.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.  Because they were looking at low blood pressure.
<b>PT:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You don't think so?
<b>PT:</b> Unless they operate on me.
<b>DR:</b> Well, let me see what they've been working with on that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> I'll review all medication with you.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I don't care.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, let's see.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] that don't help.  The doctor told me today.
<b>DR:</b> Because, when we decided on the Geodon -
<b>PT:</b> No, that don't help.  I don't want it.
<b>DR:</b> That was partly -
<b>PT:</b> I don't want it no more.  No -
<b>DR:</b> Well, we can certainly look at alternatives.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> There was a situation -
<b>PT:</b> I'm not taking it no more.
<b>DR:</b> Well, we'll see.  Because there was a situation that had -
<b>PT:</b> The doctor told me no.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  He said no?
<b>PT:</b> No.  No more.
<b>DR:</b> No more on the Geodon, exactly?
<b>PT:</b> It don't help me.  No.  I don't want it no more.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  What about the other ones we've tried?  This -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Does something stand out as better?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> All right, we can see.
<b>PT:</b> No, they don't help.
<b>DR:</b> We can see.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], they make me cry, they make me cry.
<b>DR:</b> You were doing well with it because you were taking it with food.
<b>PT:</b> No.  I don't want it no more.  Don't make me cry.  I'm going to [DEIDENTIFIED] I'm going to get a [INAUDIBLE].  I'm going to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> What about, okay, [PATIENT NAME], don't change the subject completely.  You know that Celexa, 10 mg, you can take it in the morning -
<b>PT:</b> But I don't want it.  I'm going to cry again.  I'm going to cry.
<b>DR:</b> You're feeling like having a break from everything aren't you?
<b>PT:</b> I am.  I want cut off.
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] no medicines.
<b>DR:</b> I would be willing to talk with your primary doctor about finding the right combination of things.
<b>PT:</b> No, the doctor will say no.  I'm going to [DEIDENTIFIED] this -
<b>DR:</b> Let me see.  Let me see what we've got going on.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want it no more.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And I know the doctor was looking at your nutrition.
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't want it no more.
<b>DR:</b> Your calicum.
<b>PT:</b> Don't make me cry.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I don't want to make you cry.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not going to take it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, I would be happy to talk with him about something that might sit, sit best with you.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] his medicines.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> He's looking at your thyroid too.  I see that.
<b>PT:</b> If only they could operate on me, I'd be fine, and they can't do that, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> They're talking about an operation?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sure?
<b>PT:</b> No, they're, oh, come on, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Can I tell you the good news?
<b>PT:</b> What?
<b>DR:</b> Listen to this.  This is your blood work from [DATE], so that's earlier this month.  It's fantastic.  Your cholesterol is 199, very good.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want, I don't want to make a change.
<b>DR:</b> We can certainly talk about it, but I will tell you that in terms of your metabolic status -
<b>PT:</b> I can't take [INAUDIBLE], no more.
<b>DR:</b> It's good.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, don't make me cry.  I don't want to cry, but I'll do it.
<b>DR:</b> Because we want to keep you at a minimum, you're just on 2 things, the Geodon, which is the main thing.
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't like it.
<b>DR:</b> And some of the Celexa.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], it makes me cry.  I told you that, you make me cry.
<b>DR:</b> Well, we'll put our heads together and we'll find something that works better, okay?  Let me just finish telling you, blood sugar, great, 92.
<b>PT:</b> I, I don't care.  I don't want no more medicines.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, cholesterol, good triglycerides, good thyroid.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And a good blood count.
<b>PT:</b> That don't help me no more.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum, calcium is back to normal, excellent.
<b>PT:</b> No.  I want to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Don't get me crying.  I'll cry all night.
<b>DR:</b> And your weight has been holding steady -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] again.
<b>DR:</b> For the last couple of years.
<b>PT:</b> No.  I will not have it.  [INAUDIBLE].  I'm going to tell [NAME OTHER] this.  I mean it, [INAUDIBLE] me crying.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you have every reason to celebrate.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to celebrate, low cholesterol, that don't help.
<b>DR:</b> You don't like the blood pressure?
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't want the blood pressure medicine.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, I don't see anything on here for blood pressure at this point.  That's odd.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't say blood pressure, I said for my, for my kidneys.
<b>DR:</b> For your kidneys?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Ah.
<b>PT:</b> The doctors say that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want you to make me cry.
<b>DR:</b> For your kidneys.
<b>PT:</b> You are going to have me crying again.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I don't want that to happen.
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to tell [NAME OTHER] this.  I mean it.
<b>DR:</b> You know what I think makes the most sense?  Is for me to talk with your primary doctor about exactly what's going on with your kidneys, and if there's anything that needs to be adjusted, we -
<b>PT:</b> I don't like this.
<b>DR:</b> No, it's okay.
<b>PT:</b> Now you've got me crying.
<b>DR:</b> We'll just all work together.  It's all right.  You're doing a great job explaining how you're feeling.  That's good.
<b>PT:</b> Going to have me crying, I'm going to tell [NAME OTHER], I don't like the cholesterol medicine.
<b>DR:</b> The cholesterol medicine?
<b>PT:</b> I don't like [INAUDIBLE].  I didn't say cholesterol, I said the kidney pill.
<b>DR:</b> The kidney pill.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I'm trying to figure out which one it is because I'm not seeing anything that I would usually think of for your kidneys.
<b>PT:</b> They said they're change it, they have to change it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> That's how come I want [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Ah-ha, I see it.  It's the oxybutynin, yes, the Ditropan.  I see what you're talking about.
<b>PT:</b> I don't like it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.
<b>PT:</b> We  have to do something.
<b>DR:</b> I'm going to talk to your doctor about that then.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'll tell [NAME OTHER] [INAUDIBLE] it's bothering me.
<b>DR:</b> I'll say that's bothering you, yeah.  I see what you're talking about.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] pills.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and you have the Zantac for the upset stomach.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Right, okay.  But, that's okay?
<b>PT:</b> That's okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  All right, now, sorry, it took me a few minutes to figure that out.  It was in a different section of the chart than I expected.
<b>PT:</b> I get upset every night.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's got to be really frustrating.
<b>PT:</b> I don't like that.
<b>DR:</b> Well, of course not.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Well, we will certainly work on that.  Now, aside from that, are you sleeping okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right, that's good.  So, at least that's under control.
<b>PT:</b> I do all right, I take milkshakes every night.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Good, and you're keeping your weight nice and steady.  That's excellent.  You're very petite, so your weight is just exactly right.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] cut down.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  Good.  Good.  You've been doing everything right.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yep, you have been doing all the right stuff.  That is for sure.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Okey dokey.  Yeah, I've been looking at your weight and your blood pressure measurements over the last couple of years -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Did you have a nice Easter?
<b>DR:</b> I did, thanks.  How about you?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] came out to see me [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's nice.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b> I got to call her, I called her yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> Now that the weather is nicer, it's easier to get around, but today is really hot.
<b>PT:</b> You know [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>DR:</b> What's that, hon?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, [DEIDENTIFIED], yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Even been up there?
<b>DR:</b> Yes, that's a beautiful setting.  That's where you spend most of your day, right?
<b>PT:</b> That's where I go.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's excellent.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] swimming pool.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I think [DEIDENTIFIED] is nicer than [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> What's that, hon?
<b>PT:</b> Any paper?
<b>DR:</b> Any extra paper?  I might be able to find you, what about, oh, look at these pictures.
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED].  You looking for a blank piece?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah, I'll, oh, here some.  How about this?  It's, it's a memo pad.  Would that be okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If I give you a couple pieces of that?  That would be fine.
<b>PT:</b> I, I need the lines.
<b>DR:</b> What's that, hon?
<b>PT:</b> I like the lines.
<b>DR:</b> Ah, here you go.  Well, thank you very, very much for talking with me today.  And we can, you know try to understand better about medicines, and how they work together, and how we talk about them.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, this is really, oh, you want a kind with lines?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Let me see if I can find you a blank one with lines.  Every so often, there's one left in the chart that still has lines on it.  Are you going to be writing a letter?
<b>PT:</b> I like the lines.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, let's see, every so often, yea, I found a blank one.
<b>PT:</b> With lines.
<b>DR:</b> There you go, my dear.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> How's that?  That's good.
<b>PT:</b> The lines.
<b>DR:</b> There are the lines.
<b>PT:</b> I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That's excellent.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] tablet.
<b>DR:</b> Well, this is the only kind I have.  Yeah, I don't have a tablet with me like, you know, where you can tear off the top.  I have some order sheets, but I don't think those would do you much good.
<b>PT:</b> I need a tablet.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't have a tablet.
<b>DR:</b> The only thing that's like a tablet is this little memo pad.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll take that.
<b>DR:</b> Would that be okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I need some lines here.
<b>DR:</b> I'll take some of these off.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> We'll split the difference.  Well, somebody took their own notes on it, so I want them to be sure that they have theirs.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Because that probably reminds them.  All right, I'll take a look.  Oh, it's locked.  So, I'll tell you what -
<b>PT:</b> I don't want that kind.
<b>DR:</b> Here's a tablet.
<b>PT:</b> Well -
<b>DR:</b> How about that?  See, it's perfect, and you can even lean on the back because it's nice and firm.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> It's got some cardboard back there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That's adorable.  Did you get that for Easter?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Bingo.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you won it in Bingo.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] down here.
<b>DR:</b> Ah, that's really nice.
<b>PT:</b> And this, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's a little change purse you can put on your, uh, on your keys.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That's very cheerful to look at that little smiley face change purse.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  My sister called me [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's so nice.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b> I had an accident.
<b>DR:</b> What happened?
<b>PT:</b> I had diarrhea when I came back.  I couldn't make it in time.
<b>DR:</b> When you came back from Easter?
<b>PT:</b> No, today.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, today.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You look great now, though.  It looks like you got all completely changed, and showered, and everything.
<b>PT:</b> That's why I didn't eat too much.  I can't eat certain food.  It goes through me.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  It looks like your gastroenterology doctor is looking into, you know, trying to find things that agree with you and help keep you, you know, with a calm stomach.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I almost got sick in the van, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> There's also a little tummy bug going around called Norovirus.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So, quite a few people, this is the [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED] and it looks like maybe this one, because look, here's one with the, all the, vegetables in the basket.  Isn't that nice?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I think that's an extra, so you could have that.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's the [DEIDENTIFIED].  Huh.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't see you a couple weeks ago.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, we haven't had a chance to catch up in a while.  It has been a couple of weeks.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, would you want to open the door for me?
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], he's too nice.  Called me Princess.  And the other one's nice, [NAME OTHER].  Do you know her?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know [NAME OTHER]?  That's my, that's my friend.
<b>DR:</b> That's a nice group of people.
<b>PT:</b> He won't talk to me.  He won't talk to me.
<b>DR:</b> Why not?
<b>PT:</b> Doesn't talk to me when you go out there.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> He won't talk with them.
<b>DR:</b> They're pretty friendly, I think.
<b>PT:</b> He won't talk to me.  I talk -
<b>DR:</b> They don't?
<b>PT:</b> No, they don't talk, they just walk on by.
<b>DR:</b> Could she be hard of hearing?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I fell.
<b>DR:</b> When was that?
<b>PT:</b> I imagine a couple months, weeks ago.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b> I don't [INAUDIBLE].  You know [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] and I lost my balance and [INAUDIBLE].  And I fell out in the hallway one time.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> You know, [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>DR:</b> Have you been feeling unsteady on your feet since then?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, um-hum.  My doctor -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, my goodness.
<b>PT:</b> And I hurt my elbow out in the hallway.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.  You're doing great with your range of motion now though.
<b>PT:</b> Will you tell the doctor that?
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> That I fell on my arm, [INAUDIBLE] and my back.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  How is it now?  Is it still hurting?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, my goodness.
<b>PT:</b> Can you tell the doctor that?  Put that in the book.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  Absolutely I will.
<b>PT:</b> He checked me and the hospital x-rayed my back and my arm.  [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum, yep.  It's all through [DEIDENTIFIED], that's true.
<b>PT:</b> And, obviously, at one time I had chest pain.
<b>DR:</b> When was the last time when you had any chest pain?
<b>PT:</b> Last, last, uh, Valentine's Day.
<b>DR:</b> Last Valentine's Day?  Just, uh, like 2 months ago in February?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And that's when your doctor checked you out with the heart tracing and everything, right?
<b>PT:</b> Why he do that for?
<b>DR:</b> He just wanted to make sure.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] because I didn't have no heart attack.  [INAUDIBLE] I ate two pot pies.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, two pot pies?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So maybe, um, your reflux kicked up a little bit, you know, the acid.  But, they still check the heart tracing, just to be absolutely sure, just to be on the safe side.
<b>PT:</b> I drink ginger ale.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, you, it was smart you got that checked out.
<b>PT:</b> Do you have any ginger ale?
<b>DR:</b> Meals?
<b>PT:</b> Ginger ale.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, ginger ale, I don't think so.  I haven't seen any food or drink in this office.
<b>PT:</b> That's all I can have.
<b>DR:</b> Would they have any out front if you wanted to ask?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You might, they might have some extra.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Oh yeah, like, yeah, I saw you get the milk shake supplements, that's very good.
<b>PT:</b> I don't like, I don't like that kind, yuck.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  What's your favorite flavor?
<b>PT:</b> I used to take strawberry, but not that stuff, yuck, it tastes like chalk.  [LAUGHING], it tastes like chalk.
<b>DR:</b> They could really improve the flavors on some of those.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].  Do you want a milk shake?
<b>DR:</b> I'm okay, thank you.  Thank you for asking though.
<b>PT:</b> I had a big cup of soda [INAUDIBLE] once in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?
<b>PT:</b> He bought me a soda.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's nice.  What kind of soda is your favorite?
<b>PT:</b> He bought me a Coke.
<b>DR:</b> A Coke?
<b>PT:</b> Diet.
<b>DR:</b> A Diet Coke?  Very good.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] chicken sandwich, because he gave me, I ate the last, he gave me, uh, [INAUDIBLE] [NAME OTHER], you know [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> How do you know [NAME OTHER], that name?
<b>DR:</b> I think just by, uh, by having worked here for so many years.
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], isn't his name [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> I think his name is [NAME OTHER], yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Well, he had [INAUDIBLE], so he gave me that.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's so nice.
<b>PT:</b> I like him.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's a good staff, it's a good group.
<b>PT:</b> He said, I'm his girl.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, [LAUGHING], that's nice.
<b>PT:</b> I like him.
<b>DR:</b> It's always nice to have somebody looking out for you.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] doctor, her and, uh, [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> How do you know [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> I think just through working here all these years.  Sooner or later, you cross paths with most people.
<b>PT:</b> How do you know [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> Just by working here.
<b>PT:</b> Is that his name [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> I don't know his last name, but I'm pretty sure it's [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Yep.
<b>PT:</b> I know him, [INAUDIBLE].  He works, he works here?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, for some years I think.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], I was telling, he drove me, yeah, he took me to the hospital.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, he took you to the hospital that time?
<b>PT:</b> I got a shower.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  So, you got some help with that.
<b>PT:</b> And he helped me.  [INAUDIBLE] helped me [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> He made a milk shake.  I got 2 now.
<b>DR:</b> Which ones?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], and another one.  I'll make sure I get [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You're very smart to keep on top of that.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I'll be able to work tomorrow.
<b>DR:</b> You may have had a brush with that virus.  A lot of people are having some of that.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  People are also noticing sometimes a little bit of congestion with it too.  Do you have any nose congestion?
<b>PT:</b> Well, yesterday, I talked to my sister, [NAME OTHER], take me to [DEIDENTIFIED] again.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> Got me a newspaper, [INAUDIBLE].  Have you ever been to the [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> What did you get there?
<b>DR:</b> I'm not sure.
<b>PT:</b> I got, next time I go I'll get the egg omlete with toast [INAUDIBLE] I'll bring it back here.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b> I'm going bowling.
<b>DR:</b> You're going bowling?
<b>PT:</b> Not tomorrow.
<b>DR:</b> No kidding?
<b>PT:</b> Not tomorrow.  Tomorrow is Tuesday.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Not Wednesday.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> When will I have blood work again?  Huh?
<b>DR:</b> What's that?
<b>PT:</b> When will I have blood work again?
<b>DR:</b> When will you have blood work again?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't need to be for a little while because you just had it at the beginning of this month, and it was fantastic.
<b>PT:</b> Well, this is all, this is all -
<b>DR:</b> Did you get all purple?
<b>PT:</b> All bruised.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry to hear that.
<b>PT:</b> They stuck me here twice.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> And this was bleeding so, and [NAME OTHER], you know [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], how do you know her?
<b>DR:</b> Just from working here all this time.  Most definitely.
<b>PT:</b> Well she, uh, who's [NAME OTHER]?  She works at night?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, she works on the night shift, I think.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's off today.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Is she working today?
<b>DR:</b> I don't think today, but I think she might be on tomorrow.
<b>PT:</b> Tomorrow.  I like her.  She stopped it from bleeding, that's why I, I call -
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> I'll call, I'll call, I'll call for [INAUDIBLE] paper towel.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Did you?
<b>PT:</b> It's black and blue.
<b>DR:</b> Is it still black and blue under there?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well, from the point of view from the Geodon, considering how good your blood test results look -
<b>PT:</b> Why am I always,  I'm always choking?
<b>DR:</b> I'm not, I'm not really sure.
<b>PT:</b> I can't have no sugar.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I can't have sugar?
<b>DR:</b> I don't know.  I know your doctors are, are arranging your medication and your diet pretty carefully, but I think you can have some.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] my throat.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], feel like I was going to throw up, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I think it's especially now that you might be having a little brush with that virus going around.
<b>PT:</b> My throat gets kind of dry.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> We could see if they have any more, you know, anything else for you to drink.  You know, there's that nice drinking fountain out front.
<b>PT:</b> I want ginger ale.
<b>DR:</b> Would you want some of that?  They might have ginger ale.  I think sugar free ginger ale would be especially good.
