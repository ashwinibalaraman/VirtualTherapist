BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so how are things?  You were in the hospital?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I went to the hospital, um, because I had so much worry on me about [NAME OTHER] because [NAME OTHER] for the past four years hasn't gotten in touch with me to talk to me about anything.  She's built up this hate and envy and jealousy against me because she says I have won all my life, things that are in my life that I've done and I've won and she hasn't done anything and she said this to me about, she said something to mama and daddy about this about a year ago, it's been building up since then and she's just really stressing me out because I've got all these things to think about.  She acts like she wants to kill me half the time.  Last time I went down to see her in [DEIDENTIFIED], she acted like she wanted to try to kill me because I wouldn't talk to her.  Well, I was all to myself and had a lot on my mind so I didn't talk to anybody but, anyhow, um, I consistently wrote her a letter, to tell her, to try to keep in touch with her, and she never answered any of them and I wrote her one just about two weeks ago, no I mean just about a week ago and she hasn't answered it.  So I'm dealing with her jealousies and her envious ways to make her mad and, um, I don't know why she don't love me.  And so, I went to the hospital and I found out many ways I could help her, you know, and I can think better in the hospital and I found out all these ways that I could help her, for me to see her and give her more attention because that's what she needs.  I just didn't give her any attention for the past four years so she got upset.  So I found, um, I started on them and one of them was writing her a letter and the other one is just calling her and, yknow, finding out things about her, saying the right things to her, yknow, and things like that, but, um, I don't know if it will work.  Hopefully, it will.  Nothing else has worked, but I don't know.  
<b>DR:</b> Are you hearing any voices?
<b>PT:</b> No, I haven't heard any voices.  And -
<b>DR:</b> When was the last time you heard voices?
<b>PT:</b> About twenty years ago.
<b>DR:</b> Twenty years ago?
<b>PT:</b> I just, I didn't hear, I heard people out in the hall.  I didn't hear, it was life, you know, I mean, it was just regular normal life, everyday conversation, they were just outside my hall and I thought I heard something, which I really did, but at the time I didn't know and, um, so I haven't heard voices in a long time and I don't really need, um, I think a lot about other people and what they say, you know, I can hear them talking, you know, saying things.
<b>DR:</b> Like what would they say?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, just their feelings towards me, or their feelings towards things that I've done.
<b>DR:</b> So you would hear their thoughts.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I would actually try to read into them and see what they thought about different things and - 
<b>DR:</b> So would they be talking to you?
<b>PT:</b> I just was thinking, well, this is just thinking about them.
<b>DR:</b> Thinking about their things?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Their feelings and thoughts?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you could actually sense what they were thinking?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> About you and you, and were feeling that they were thinking things about you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And how did that affect your behavior?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, it was okay because it was good thoughts.  Um, you know, nothing negative, positive things, it's always positive things coming through now instead of when I first got my chemical imbalance, I felt like, again, all the things that I thought about people and what they thought about me or whatever they thought, it was all negative.
<b>DR:</b> So what you were hearing in your head was the negative things that they were thinking about you?
<b>PT:</b> What I thought was, what I thought they would think about me.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But they actually said they didn't.  I talked with some and they, I told them, I said well do you think I'm a diseased person because I've got this chemical imbalance and do you think I'm weird, do you think I'm not normal and things like this matter and we talked about it and so they know now that, yknow, it's something they have to deal with, with me.  But I was going to tell you, I got depressed, I was so depressed that, um, I didn't feel like taking my life, I just felt like I needed a way out so that's why I went in the hospital.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I had all these confusing thoughts.
<b>DR:</b> Like what?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I mean, it's just, I don't know.  Um, my thoughts kept jumping from one thing to the other, but it didn't last for very long.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And then the next morning, it'd be the same way and, um, I just was all confused about what [NAME OTHER] was going to do and so I went in the hospital and they told me that she's got a problem, [PHYSICIAN NAME], I think she's got a chemical imbalance where's she's got combative, compulsive mood swings, mood behavior and, because she has symptoms like I had with the dizziness and confusion.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But she won't tell anybody and, um, I mean, I thought it was her glasses, that she needed glasses and she said well that helps a little, um, but she just didn't say anything more and so she still has these mood swings and everything and I can't get her to where she'll go to the doctor and, um, she would just, she's just moody and mean and all these things and I'm having to deal with that.  I mean she's throwing it all on me for the past four years.  She's throwing all these feelings and emotions on me and it's like a game and I just, it's so unreal, it's so contorted and I think she makes things up on the way and I think what it is in a nutshell is she wants to be higher, I mean she wants to do more than what I've ever done in my life.  She wants to be the one and so, you know, more to her, I'm happy for her.  You know, I think Christ should give her a chance to do anything she wants to do and, but if she does it the wrong way, she's going to have to pay and I'm afraid she will so I'm worried about that.  And so I pray, it's a spiritual thing now and so I go to God and he says that everything will work out, just give her time, she'll understand what she's doing to you and she'll change and I just have to wait for that time.  And going through, um, [NAME OTHER] wants me to fail because she succeeded, I mean because I succeeded so much and she wants me to fail and, um, oh God, just doing that or taking a lower part and seeing what her life is, she wants me to go through what she went through and it's going to be hard, I know it is.  I don't know how I'm going to stand it, but I mean we're working on, for the next year, to see if she can do any better.
<b>DR:</b> I noticed they got some slightly new medicines.  They've got Trilafon.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, do they?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Am I supposed to take that?
<b>DR:</b> It looks like you were on Geodon 80 in the morning, 160 at night, Inderal 10 mg twice daily, Lithium 450 mg twice daily, Xanax 0.5 at bedtime and Trilafon 4 mg twice daily.
<b>PT:</b> What's Trilafon?
<b>DR:</b> A nerve pill like Geodon?
<b>PT:</b> Oh.  I haven't - I'm taking a nerve pill?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they're nerve pills.
<b>PT:</b> I never had a nerve pill.
<b>DR:</b> You've been on those before, but I guess they put them on while you were in the hospital.
<b>PT:</b> They're always changing my medicine.
<b>DR:</b> Well, whatever, do you feel like what you're on now is working.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I didn't think I had any nervous problem in the beginning.  All I wanted to do was go in to get some help for [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, were those monitors being watched?  Were you concerned about the monitoring?
<b>PT:</b> This?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, I was trying to take it off of me at the house because things weren't going right and they were getting on my nerves, the people that were on the other side and, um, so I tried to take it off and the scissors opened up.  I had a pair of scissors.  
<b>DR:</b> Now is that the way that they can track you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's the way they track me down and I just want to be off of the thing because I didn't, I had everybody against me, it felt like that everybody - 
<b>DR:</b> Who's in charge of tracking you down?
<b>PT:</b> You know the, um, not the people in the area, but, um, the police officers they know me now because I have a friend that works over there, [NAME OTHER] and he works over at I guess it's the police department - 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Or something, a range or something, I don't know exactly where it is, but they know me, and they're good with me.  They'll come on and check with me first to see if I'm off the premises, they don't just come get me.  
<b>DR:</b> So we want to just keep, it looks like we can keep everything like you have it right now.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, it's just that I'm going through all these emotions that, I mean [NAME OTHER] won't let me help her, she won't accept my help.
<b>DR:</b> Where is [NAME OTHER] living?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] is living in [DEIDENTIFIED] still, so she's getting help, I mean, you know, she's got a whole bunch of people helping her.  And they're boosting her up and making her look good and while she's feeling good, you know, she's praying now and she's reading the bible more and she's just doing so much better.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> With these past few months, you know, she's got a high with Christ so maybe that's helping and, um, you know, I'm taking her load it seems like, yknow, having a bad year and I guess that's the way Christ wants it then that's the way it'll be, but I'm going through and it's just terrible.  Some things I'm scared of are like, my emotions swinging to the point where I might do something harmful to somebody and I might go to jail.  I mean, that scare's always in me.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  What would you do to harm somebody?
<b>PT:</b> I wouldn't do anything, [PHYSICIAN NAME], I really wouldn't, but here, lately I just, it doesn't work to get mad at people, you know, anger does not work, it don't solve anything.  You know, it's better to sit and talk it out and not get angry.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And there's so many things that I have to remember while I'm going through what I'm going through with [NAME OTHER] and if I forget one, I just can't remember everything.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I mean it's like I'm totally lost and instead of doing something and doing it well, I'm doing something poor so I don't try to help anybody.  You know, I'm a Christian and I help people with their problems and everything, but I'm getting to the point where things just don't make any sense anymore.  But, um, business, I don't have any and it's just spiritually this thing with [NAME OTHER] and daddy's going all the way with it and mama's going all the way with it and [NAME OTHER] is doing fine.
<b>DR:</b> She's doing fine?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, but no nausea, no headaches?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And you're still seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] for your liver problems?
<b>PT:</b> Um, yes, I am, but they're taking the care for Hepatitis B that that little black girl gave me, I could kill her for it.  I didn't mean that.  That's just something you say.
<b>DR:</b> Are they still giving you treatments?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What drug are they using?
<b>PT:</b> Pegasys, I believe it's called and Mirafenin, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Pegasys and - 
<b>PT:</b> Pegasys and? 
<b>DR:</b> Mucinex?
<b>PT:</b> That might be one.
<b>DR:</b> Copegus?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, all righty, so we'll keep everything psychiatric the way it is, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
