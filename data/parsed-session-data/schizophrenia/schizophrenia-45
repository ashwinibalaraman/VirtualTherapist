BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Alright, so tell me [PATIENT NAME] how you doing?
<b>PT:</b> Ah, I know my medicine did not run out but I’m not doin’ as well as I’d like. Um, I feel Paxil and Adderall have saved my life, however, um I need a decrease in Paxil because it’s pushing my <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> out and a decrease in Adderall because I’m way too mind stimulated. I do talk to myself. I even make hand motions to myself and I can’t even control myself with people and I have been doing wonderful on Zyprexa for years but 22.5, it’s like a knock out pill. It will knock me out and I can’t wake up and Adderall helps me wake up but I still love Adderall because it saved my life. My thought process was slow and not it’s a little sped up and I would like a decrease in both, all three to be honest.
<b>DR:</b> Well, the Paxil, the Adderall and the Zyprexa. Alright. You’re on a job interview is that why you’re dressed up like this. Where are you interviewing?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>DR:</b> And, what is that?
<b>PT:</b> It’s a base salary with commission. It’s ah, sales, inside sales.
<b>DR:</b> What do they sell, copy machines?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Copy machines.
<b>PT:</b> Something. Yeah, I gotta go research for my interview.
<b>DR:</b> Oh you have to research. Now, what’s going on that your mom needed this emergency appointment? Like what…
<b>PT:</b> I’m just not doing well like my Paxil and Adderall and Zyprexa are all too high.
<b>DR:</b> And what kind of symptoms are telling you that it’s too high?
<b>PT:</b> Talking to myself, not controlling myself in front of people, ah, my thoughts are being spread out, ah and all three are just…it’s too much for me to handle. I think we’ll decrease with a combination as to what you and I feel necessary.
<b>DR:</b> Alright. What’s your mom think is going on? Do you have an idea?
<b>PT:</b> She just knows I’m not doing well.
<b>DR:</b> Alright. Are you depressed?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. It’s too much medicine for me to handle.
<b>DR:</b> Alright.
<b>PT:</b> But Zyprexa the tremor took years to go away but it went away.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right, right. Do you feel suicidal at all?
<b>PT:</b> Not at all.
<b>DR:</b> No. Hearing things… you getting that double talking.
<b>PT:</b> Just word for word thinking, normal thinking but very content with my life with two job interviews. One’s an agency interview. Don’t really care about the money just want to live at home for a year - two and half years, reanalyze my career like I already told you and ah take it from there. Very happy with my automobile and ah that’s about it. I’ll show you a receipt. It’s a cost of life. I’ll go weigh myself real quick.
<b>DR:</b> How tall are you?
<b>PT:</b> 5’6” - 5’7”.
<b>DR:</b> $1,200 bucks.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I’m crazy.
<b>DR:</b> What is it, the rims?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> $1,200 for chrome rims?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How much do you weigh?
<b>PT:</b> 160
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] $1,200 for chrome rims.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they say MAZZI on them. I won it in AC
<b>DR:</b> Right. You won the money in Atlantic City. So what were you playing?
<b>PT:</b> Roulette. I played strategies but it ruined my face the next day. It blew up in my face. So no more AC.
<b>DR:</b> Does your mom know that you went to Atlantic City?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Were you drinking?
<b>PT:</b> Not at all. Haven’t drank in 6 months.
<b>DR:</b> You lost weight. In September you were 166. You’ve lost 6 lbs. You look like you lost some weight. 168 in August.
<b>PT:</b> It’s not about weight. 
<b>DR:</b> Hold on. You lost a lot of weight. You lost 10 lbs. That’s good. You taking the Zyprexa ?
<b>PT:</b> Of course.
<b>DR:</b> You haven’t missed any?
<b>PT:</b> Never, that’s my life depends on it. I don’t like people hearing me think.
<b>DR:</b> Alright. So, maybe we should bring mom back now.
<b>PT:</b> Before we adjust them. Alright, let me…
<b>DR:</b> No, I’ll get her, I’ll get her. [NAME OTHER] can you ask [NAME OTHER] to come back now please?You don’t look too bad to me.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you sir.
<b>DR:</b> I’ll tell mom when she comes in about the [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> You reminded me, I have to research the company. I’m a dumb ass. You reminded me.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you for reminding me. I have to research the company and we’ll take it from there, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Hi [NAME OTHER] How are you?
<b>CG:</b> Good.
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] your son’s agreed, I’m doing a marketing research program here so we’re tape recording the a…
<b>CG:</b> You’re doing what?
<b>DR:</b> Marketing research. Basically what it is is we’re doing market research on antidepressants, antipsychotic and ADD medications. So I had 4-5 patients agree to allow to tape record the sessions. His name won’t go on it it’s just they will type it up and then send it off to the company. He said it was okay. You have any issue with this?
<b>CG:</b> No, no.
<b>DR:</b> You sure?
<b>CG:</b> As long as his name doesn’t go in it.
<b>DR:</b> His name won’t go on it.
<b>CG:</b> Privacy something. He’s not thinking straight.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right. It’s all HIPAA compliant.
<b>CG:</b> That’s my only concern. I trust you. Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I needed somebody who had <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> and [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> I feel I’ve been doing good on 20 Zyprexa for years and it knocks me out and I can’t wake up.
<b>DR:</b> 22.5
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I feel 20 I’ve been doing good and I’d love the Paxil and Adderall cut. What’s your perception?
<b>CG:</b> I don’t know. Medicine is the thing…
<b>DR:</b> What’s going on that you needed to come in urgently?
<b>CG:</b> I thought you told me.
<b>PT:</b> I told him about the gambling, I told him how I have to be patient with the banks with overdrafts and I wrote a letter to the supervisor that the banks and companies can’t keep up with me. That I have 1-3 overdrafts but they charged 7 and I don’t like it and if I get the money back I do, I got you what - 622, but I’m negative 484, so the 140 I’m just going to use for gas and miscellaneous expenses and ah going to pay off my college loans ASAP.
<b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME]
<b>PT:</b> Did you tell him you went and cashed your 401K? Did you tell him everything.
<b>DR:</b> You cashed your 401K plan?
<b>PT:</b> I had an account number and a routing number.
<b>DR:</b> How much was in your 401K?
<b>PT:</b> Well it went all the way back down. I had $1,300 and it went all the way
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Alright.
<b>CG:</b> $2,000 in Atlantic City. Don’t you think that’s ridiculous?
<b>PT:</b> But I’m overall up $1,420.
<b>DR:</b> I have tremendous concern here.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I have tremendous concern.
<b>CG:</b> That’s why I brought him here. And everyday he’s charging close $200
<b>PT:</b> What!
<b>DR:</b> On credit cards?
<b>CG:</b> No. On his debit card.
<b>PT:</b> No I’m not.
<b>CG:</b> Because he has a loan from [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I haven’t been spending anything.
<b>DR:</b> Do you know if he’s been drinking?
<b>CG:</b> I don’t know, but you told me…
<b>PT:</b> I swear to God I have not been tempted to drink as long as I lived at home.
<b>CG:</b> Have you done any drugs?
<b>PT:</b> Never. I haven’t drank in 6 months and I’m proud of it. I’m sober and happy, thanks to the doctors...
<b>DR:</b> How much was in the 401L…in pay $927.
<b>PT:</b> 82
<b>CG:</b> Where did you…how did you win $1,800 something close to $2,000 in Atlantic City?
<b>PT:</b> Roulette. I’m an evil genius.
<b>CG:</b> He thinks he very smart with the money. [INAUDIBLE] Atlantic City is the way to make money, I wouldn’t be here.
<b>PT:</b> No more gambling. The next day the strategy blew up in my face the next day I lost 420 in a half hour. The strategy blew up in my face.
<b>DR:</b> You can’t win at Roulette.
<b>PT:</b> Well, you do have the advantage in Black Jack.
<b>DR:</b> I saw it, $1,200 for rims.
<b>CG:</b> $1,400 and then on top of that he gets $20 [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Well it’s a $100 for installation.
<b>CG:</b> I wouldn’t give $20 for my dinner.[INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> No it’s not.
<b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME] I have to let the doctor know what I think. You can tell me it’s wrong that’s okay no problem but you have to let me speak.
<b>PT:</b> I don’t think all three medicines are appropriate.
<b>DR:</b> Here’s what may be going on. One, we have to stop the Adderall. That stops today.
<b>PT:</b> COMPLETELY? That saved my life.
<b>DR:</b> How did it save your life?
<b>PT:</b> My thought process was…doosh….doosh…doosh
<b>CG:</b> Just take a look at all that I have.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right I glanced at those.
<b>CG:</b> Can I make a copy of those.
<b>DR:</b> He’s smoking more?
<b>CG:</b> Mmm Hmm.
<b>DR:</b> No, I have this.
<b>PT:</b> Check out the back paper what I wrote to the bank all the way back, flip it over.
<b>CG:</b> Writing to the banks and he’s doing things without asking us.
<b>PT:</b> I’ll read it to you.
<b>DR:</b> No, no, no, that’s okay. That’s alright.
<b>CG:</b> Stop stop.
<b>DR:</b> Ah, here’s what I believe okay. [PATIENT NAME] diagnosed with <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia2"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia3" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> but it looks like he may be having some manicform or manic type of behavior.
<b>CG:</b> He had that before.
<b>DR:</b> I think you’re at a point where you need to add a mood stabilizer to the Zyprexa. I think we can cut the Adderall to 
<b>PT:</b> To 5 or 7.5
<b>DR:</b> No, it’s a 5 unless [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Yeah it does.
<b>DR:</b> It does? Alright. We can cut it to 5 
<b>PT:</b> and then cut the Paxil…
<b>DR:</b> We can stop the Paxil but you have to add a mood stabilizer
<b>PT:</b> What about the Zyprexa?
<b>DR:</b> Stays the same.
<b>PT:</b> But it’s like it knocks me out.
<b>DR:</b> You have to keep it the same. I can’t…it is an anti-manic agent as well. It good in mania as well and you need to be on that. If I take that off or decrease it.
<b>PT:</b> Heh, I love Zyprexa. I would take 30-40 of Zyprexa but that’s not appropriate because it makes you eat and sleep 24/7.
<b>DR:</b> Ah, ah, I think you need an anti-manic agent. Once we start it, next time you come in I can look at something called Provigil during the day. Have you been on that?
<b>PT:</b> No never taken Provigil<b> </b> or Seroquel.
<b>DR:</b> The Adderall we’ll be able to stop and you can start Provigil.
<b>CG:</b> What is Provigil?
<b>DR:</b> Provigil<b> </b> is exactly for what [PATIENT NAME] is saying you’re overmedicated or fell overmedicated. He’s not but he feels lethargic, sedated, sluggish during the day.
<b>PT:</b> No. Not during the day just going to sleep. Zyprexa - - BOOM!
<b>DR:</b> So what’s the problem with that though?
<b>PT:</b> Alright, that’s no problem with that. Waking up is hard for me.
<b>DR:</b> Well that’s the point. The Provigil<b> </b> helps with daytime …
<b>PT:</b> Alright, I’m contradicting myself. When I take the Adderall I wake up like no time. The first thing I do is drop Adderall, water and then I do my thing.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But I love Paxil.
<b>DR:</b> Right, you want to stay on Paxil.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, how about we decrease it to…
<b>DR:</b> You can’t decrease the CR. You have to go to the regular Paxil to 5 mg.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But you’ll need a mood stabilizer.
<b>PT:</b> That’s 4 meds, that way too much doc.
<b>DR:</b> Then you can stop the Paxil.
<b>PT:</b> How about Paxil as 7 - 12?
<b>DR:</b> Paxil I can go to 5 mg.
<b>PT:</b> What CR?
<b>DR:</b> Regular, they don’t come, you can’t get…
<b>CG:</b> Then if it’s regular then he would have to take the generic.
<b>DR:</b> The generic. You can cut the CR into half.
<b>PT:</b> I’ve been doin’ that.
<b>DR:</b> We’ll order the 12.5 then you can cut them in half.
<b>PT:</b> Perfect.
<b>CG:</b> He should take half of that.
<b>DR:</b> He can go to half of a 12.5
<b>PT:</b> How about the Zyprexa we go to 20?
<b>DR:</b> No. That stays the same.
<b>CG:</b> Start listening to the doctor.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he right, he’s right, he’s right.
<b>DR:</b> No you leave that the same. He needs a mood stabilizer. He needs a mood stabilizer. No question.
<b>PT:</b> Paxil is the best mood stabilizer.
<b>DR:</b> No. Paxil is an antidepressant. It’s not a mood stabilizer.
<b>PT:</b> It’s an antischizophrenic too.
<b>DR:</b> No it’s not. It’s an antidepressant Paxil it has nothing to do with <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia3"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia4" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>.
<b>PT:</b> It says on the Web site Paxil for <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia3" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia4"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia5" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>.
<b>DR:</b> It does not, it’s not for <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia4" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia5"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia6" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>. Zyprexa is for <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia5" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia6"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia7" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>.
<b>PT:</b> I don’t think a fourth medicine will do me good.
<b>DR:</b> I think that what you’re demonstrating very clearly is manic behavior. If you were in your right mind you would never spend $1,200 on rims. You never, in a million years, you wouldn’t do it.
<b>PT:</b> But I want it.
<b>DR:</b> No. you would not do it. You know how I know that. You work too hard for your money.
<b>CG:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> To sit there and throw away $1,200 on a pair of chrome rims. If you were in your right mind you would never do it, I know, because when you were working all the times he was working. 
<b>PT:</b> I was saving.
<b>CG:</b> At that time it was like he was on this side.
<b>PT:</b> That was just a living at home situation.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>CG:</b> I had to force him. [PATIENT NAME] buy you lunch 3 times a week, you’re working with your guys [INAUDIBLE] He wouldn’t spend a dime. I got to save, I got to save, I got to save.
<b>PT:</b> I had a living at home syndrome, sure I had a living at home syndrome but I seriously had no more spending to do. I wanted to save to pay my college loans.
<b>CG:</b> You just told me you had been having that obsession and now he wants to put the radio system in the car.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>CG:</b> Before that it was the brake job. Shh. Two days ago. No this week he went and put the tinted windows in the car…spent how much money $300?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah $300.
<b>CG:</b> He’s everyday average charging $200.
<b>PT:</b> No way.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] I would recommend that we go on an anti-manic agent. I don’t think there is an option here you have to do it.
<b>CG:</b> You have no choice.
<b>DR:</b> No, really, there is no choice. And you know what I have very seldom laid down the law here with you, I really haven’t. I made suggestions, I poked, I prodded but today you have to do it. You don’t have a choice. You are going to run yourself into ruin, you’re going to destroy your credit rating, you’ve cashed out the Holy Grail, the Holy Grail is your 401K. You don’t touch your 401K plan until the day you’re ready to retire [INAUDIBLE]…unless you’re ready to retire you don’t touch your 401K or you get cancer and you need the money.
<b>CG:</b> Nobody touches it.
<b>DR:</b> Nobody touches 401k, never, ever, ever, ever, it doesn’t matter what’s going on in your world, unless you have cancer you don’t touch it.
<b>CG:</b> Anger is on the rise…
<b>PT:</b> No it’s not on the rise. Let me give you negative knowledge about 401k. People think it’s a retirement account. Wrong. You can borrow against it to pay for your house, car, college tuition.
<b>DR:</b> You never touch it.
<b>PT:</b> My dad told me that.
<b>DR:</b> What happens, you’re going to borrow against it you’ll never put the money back and then you have to pay and at the end of the year you’re going to have to pay all…
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> He already paid the federal tax on it.
<b>CG:</b> He didn’t tell us…I’m getting a statement in the mail, what’s going on.
<b>DR:</b> Let’s talk about medicine…
<b>CG:</b> He’s completely manic from what I have been reading, of course you would be the best judge…
<b>DR:</b> No, no, no, you’re correctI’m going to give you options. I think you’ve been on Depakote already, right?
<b>PT:</b> No I never tried that.
<b>DR:</b> Never been on Depakote. How about…
<b>PT:</b> You know 4 medicines is a lot?
<b>DR:</b> You don’t, first of all you’re on a tiny dose of Adderall.
<b>PT:</b> Tiny dose of Paxil.
<b>DR:</b> Tiny dose of Paxil. Adding a fourth medicine is absolutely necessary here. Have to do it.
<b>CG:</b> Adderall you just can’t stop boom, he has to wean himself.
<b>PT:</b> Well, Adderall saved my life, so did Paxil
<b>DR:</b> We can take 5 mg. It won’t make a difference.
<b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME] Listen to me you don’t take the medication the back door is open for crisis. I kid you not.
<b>PT:</b> But I’ve been doing so well on Zyprexa 20.
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> He’s ready to be admitted.
<b>CG:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Yes. Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Don’t you feel Zyprexa 20 is great why 22.5?
<b>DR:</b> Because every time we try dropping you by another couple mg you can compensate and don’t do well.
<b>PT:</b> So we are tying, what’s the fourth medicine?
<b>DR:</b> Here’s the options. There is some very good anti-manic agents with low side effects.
<b>CG:</b> Which one is that?
<b>DR:</b> I’ll give you the list here.
<b>CG:</b> No, no, You know best.
<b>DR:</b> Trileptal is very good.
<b>PT:</b> No. I hated that.
<b>CG:</b> You put him on Trileptal. It didn’t work.
<b>DR:</b> Lamictal.
<b>CG:</b> Which one?
<b>DR:</b> Lamictal. You know, that’s going to take too long to work. Ah, Depakote.
<b>CG:</b> What is that for?
<b>DR:</b> Is ah - come in - yes [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>PT:</b> How about Seroquel? I’ve heard good stories about that.
<b>DR:</b> The problem with Seroquel is you’re already on Zyprexa and it’s gonna knock you out even more.
<b>PT:</b> Alright, Depakote, small, small.
<b>CG:</b> When is the best time to take Depakote if that what you are…
<b>DR:</b> You can take it at bedtime.
<b>CG:</b> Night time.
<b>DR:</b> You’ll take it at night time. You could use a little in the morning or a little at dinner and then the rest at bedtime. We’ll start him at 750 mg.
<b>CG:</b> Oh, how much you start with, what is the starting dose.
<b>DR:</b> You go 20 mg per kilogram a day per body weight. He’s 160 lbs. that’s about 70 kilograms, so he can go up to 1400 mg. We’re going to 750. It’s a medium size dose.
<b>PT:</b> What the point of it?
<b>DR:</b> It’s going to slow you down.
<b>PT:</b> You’re right. 
<b>CG:</b> He’s very hyper. You’re ready to be admitted right now.
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] is it possible that someone could get me some Depakote? 
<b>CG:</b> Sure what do you want?
<b>DR:</b> A couple of boxes of 500 a couple boxes of 250. Thank you. This is a must. There’s no option here otherwise I would give you an option. You have to be on it.
<b>CG:</b> Doctor, from what I’m looking at here and reading about it and educating myself…[PATIENT NAME] stop, you are [PATIENT NAME] one step closer to a hospital everyday.
<b>PT:</b> My anger is not on the rise.
<b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME] stop, you are [PATIENT NAME] one step closer to a hospital everyday.
<b>PT:</b> That’s the last thing on my mind.
<b>CG:</b> You…
<b>PT:</b> Zyprexa makes you calm and collective and so does Adderall.
<b>CG:</b> You are extremely hyper and violent at the moment. That’s no other word for it. Doctor, he’s driving, and he’s driving and he’s driving.
<b>PT:</b> I pay my mom $5-6k doctor for miscellaneous stuff.
<b>CG:</b> He did he went and cashed his CD for $2,000.
<b>PT:</b> And I gave you $1,600.
<b>CG:</b> And what he did, he went back to the bank - let me speak I don’t want interruption from you. I told him I said put back the money along with my name What we are planning to do me and my husband if nothing else while we are alive and kicking it is his money we going to send it for his student loan---gamble money like crazy.
<b>DR:</b> You know [PATIENT NAME] is you don’t get under good control real quickly your parents are going to do something…come in thank you very much..you can put it right on the desk there perfect…Ah your parents are going to do something called financial conservatorship. Meaning, I’m going to advise your parents to pull all financial control away from you and…
<b>CG:</b> It’s what?
<b>DR:</b> Financial conservatorship. Basically means that you have to control his finances. Do you understand? I mean [PATIENT NAME] I think that what you’re doing is so risky.
<b>CG:</b> He writing these letters to the bank. I mean the bank might way okay let me just close your account. He wrote this yesterday. He just wrote on his own yesterday. He’s fighting for overdrafts for $245 within one week. He charging and charging.
<b>PT:</b> Will this bring my <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia6" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia7"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia8" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> out?
<b>DR:</b> This will help your <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia7" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia8"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia9" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>. This works great with the Zyprexa for <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia8" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia9"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span></span>. No it’s perfect . It’s like hand-in-glove. This will be very, very good.
<b>CG:</b> Are we going to start him with a dose of 500?
<b>DR:</b> 750
<b>CG:</b> That’s not too much.
<b>DR:</b> No. This is all I do all day for a living right.
<b>CG:</b> I’m sure. 
<b>PT:</b> It’s not going to make me go to the bathroom is it?
<b>DR:</b> No. it won’t give you urinary frequency. No you’ll be fine with this. This is very good medicine.
<b>PT:</b> I promise I’m saving for college loans.
<b>CG:</b> You are not.
<b>PT:</b> I will. My friends all hook up their cars.
<b>CG:</b> He’s just got an obsession with the car. Until his car is done he is not going to breath in peace. He has already decided.
<b>PT:</b> I hit a few curbs and it’s making noises my chrome rims. [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] He can take the whole thing at bedtime with the Zyprexa. It’s okay.
<b>CG:</b> At one time.
<b>DR:</b> Yes. I promise you it will be fine.
<b>CG:</b> I trust you.
<b>DR:</b> I promise you. I’ll write it down for you.
<b>PT:</b> I feel like such a loser on 4 medications.
<b>DR:</b> Well, we’ll get rid of the Adderall and we can look at getting rid of the Paxil also.
<b>PT:</b> Right now?
<b>DR:</b> No. Next time you come is. You’re on tiny, tiny doses of ah um.
<b>PT:</b> But Adderall and Paxil saved my life.
<b>DR:</b> I know but you’re only on tiny doses. This is a good medicine. Are you okay [NAME OTHER]
<b>CG:</b> Oh no no I’m fine.
<b>PT:</b> 4 medicines, I’m really that messed up huh?
<b>DR:</b> No, you’re not that messed up but you’re in the midst of a manic form break and I’m cutting the Paxil and I’m cutting the Adderall back and this is a great, great way…
<b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME], when the doctor says you’re cutting back I don’t want you to stop all of it. You mess with the medication it’s going to be on you! You wind up in crisis I am not going to see you again. That’s a given.
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME] asked me if I’m suicidal and I said I’ve never been this happy in life.
<b>DR:</b> You’re a little too happy is the problem.
<b>CG:</b> Exactly, you’re at the manic level. I’m dreading the, what’s you call it, the crashcart.
<b>PT:</b> With Paxil I’m happy.
<b>CG:</b> This is a crashcart that can come at any moment, right when reality hits.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME] reminded me that I have to research the company for my interviews.
<b>CG:</b> You better believe it he’s right, he’s absolutely right.
<b>PT:</b> I can’t go in there knowing nothing.
<b>CG:</b> Knowing nothing, well, he’s putting you on the right track.
<b>DR:</b> No urinary frequentization. See if you can read my.
<b>CG:</b> Adderall - 5 mg, Paxil - 6.25, Depakote - ER 750 bedtime.
<b>DR:</b> Alright, ah, in the Paxil CR they’ll tell you not to cut them in half but it’s okay at 12.5.
<b>CG:</b> But you had asked him to cut it.
<b>DR:</b> But now these are 12.5
<b>CG:</b> I know, I know.
<b>DR:</b> The 25’s
<b>CG:</b> I have some left.
<b>DR:</b> The 12.5’s?
<b>CG:</b> You can give me the prescription but I have some left.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>CG:</b> These will last for how much time?
<b>DR:</b> That’s 20 days worth.
<b>CG:</b> Oh, oh
<b>DR:</b> Can you make it in in 20 days? Come back to see me in about 2 ½ weeks.
<b>CG:</b> Yep, no problem or if you can give me some extra that would be nice.
<b>DR:</b> Want some extra?
<b>CG:</b> Save me a trip to the store that’s all. And if I don’t you know I’ll bring it back. I’ve done that before and I will do it again.
<b>DR:</b> Alright, here’s the Paxil...
<b>CG:</b> This medicine I keep with me
<b>PT:</b> I agree with everything you’re doing except adding that fourth medicine.
<b>CG:</b> Half meaning 
<b>DR:</b> Half the tablet. 
<b>PT:</b> I agree with everything you’re doing but adding a fourth.
<b>DR:</b> Can I have that Paxil back? [PATIENT NAME] I think it’s the smartest thing I’ve done here with you.
<b>PT:</b> Alright, how about we get rid of, well I need an antidepressant.
<b>DR:</b> I wrote for one but really you’re taking a half. They won’t fill for 30 pills.
<b>CG:</b> Doctor, what about the Zyprexa? [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Four medicines doctor? Plus Singulair and Vitamin C?
<b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME], start listening
<b>PT:</b> You really think I need four medicines. I kind of take it personally.
<b>CG:</b> What are you going to do not take the medication?
<b>PT:</b> Four medicines. I promise I’ll pay my college loans.
<b>CG:</b> Doctor, give him a reality dose. What happens?
<b>PT:</b> I promise I’ll pay my college loans.
<b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME] It’s all about you. Do you agree with me doctor? You are here to see the doctor.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], you are having what’s called mania and if you don’t get this under control, you will be in financial ruin
<b>CG:</b> He’s already in that.
<b>PT:</b> Overdrafts don’t effect your credit at [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> That’s not the point. The point is you’re spending money like it’s, it’s running…
<b>CG:</b> He’s giving money to other people. He went and give $150 to college mate.
<b>PT:</b> No I didn’t. I’m in denial, I’m in denial. I never did that. What do you want me to say mom?
<b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME] you should have given me that money, I would have put it towards the 401k.
<b>PT:</b> I wouldn’t give anyone $150. I lied and I told you that I never gave anyone $150. Did I ever give anyone money? I’m a nice chill, good kid who doesn’t let money come between friends.
<b>CG:</b> Talking of it to his friends and talking of it to his friends that’s no friends. Okay [PATIENT NAME] are you done? I want to speak with the doctor just for a minute please.
<b>DR:</b> Alright.
