<b>DR:</b>	So, how have you been [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm doing well.  You know, you have your up days and your low days.  I mean it's been well this whole experience, it's been, it's kind of I'm putting things in perspective.  I've been more open and honest with people because before all this happened, I've been, I was, you know, apprehensive to go to people and tell them what I was going through and I feel like it's sad, but it took such a traumatic experience as a suicide attempt to bring, you know, bring my depression out in the, I don't want to say the forefront, but a lot more people know what I'm going through, but it's kind of, I look at it as a blessing because now I'm honest with friends and I have like compatibility, I mean accountability, stuff like that.  So, it's been good, but as far as the depression goes, I mean I'm still, you know, I've felt well at points, felt good at points, but it's just I see it as I feel like I'm getting better, but nothing is, they've got me on that antiseizure medicine, so that's kind of been making me groggy.  So I don't know.  I can't really, I don't know.  I've been on Cymbalta, and I don't know with the Depakote that they have me on that I feel like, that I don't know if I'm being able to experience the full effect of that because the Depakote's making me feel kind of groggy.  So, I was on it for two days before I had my seizure and my parents came and visit in the center when I was out, and they said that, uh, I seemed very, you know, back to my old self, kind of more energy, lively I guess, and I don't know if that was as a result of the medication or just having seen my parents after all I've gone through because when they dropped me off, I was still a little groggy from all that Ativan.  I was still kind of delusional.
<b>DR:</b>	How much, how much medication did you took overdose?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, 28 mg.  So it was, they said a week's worth of the highest dose, and it wasn't like, I mean I feel like I've told this story so much, but it wasn't, I was thinking about when people have the suicide attempt.  I always think you have the letter written.  You have, you said your goodbyes to everybody and mine wasn't that at all.  It was like, it was a Sunday afternoon, feeling kind of low, really low.  My sister left for school and we were really close.  She was heading back to go back to Alabama, and we were having company over, and I was just feeling kind of, didn't feel too well, so I went upstairs and I had this, uh, the Ativan for if I had an anxiety attack 'cause I've had those at night.  You know, you'd get up short of breath and sometimes it'll happen for no reason.  Sometimes it'll happen for just dumb reasons like thinking about that I would never, I mean not like dumb reasons, but I would think about that what if I don't ever get married and then I kind of go in a whole tizzy about that, and before I know it, I'm just like short of breath and like panicking and it was bad, so the doctor gave me the Ativan just to take that, and that would kind of calm me down, and the Saturday night before I had taken some and I was like I like, I like how this feels 'cause it kind of, you know, loosens you up a little.  So that's why, so I'm laying in my room.  Room's a mess.  The lights are off, and I'm, I'm just going through this another way, and there's no other way to describe it, but it was like a real fucked up laundry list of, of reasons why I didn't matter.  Like I would try to justify it and—
<b>DR:</b>	All negative.
<b>PT:</b>	It was very negative.  It was like it spiraled out of control.  I'm like, in retrospect, it was like I was just so, the depression [INAUDIBLE] so much.  I didn't think about friends.  I didn't think about families.  I just thought about is that I felt like I just didn't matter, and it wouldn't, the way, I can't remember, really remember 'cause it was the ways in which I tried to justify it, I felt like I could counteract it.  And it was like my brother came to me after.  He was like well didn't you think of me or didn't you think of, I was like I really didn't, and it was just like, it's not like when you have your life flash before your eyes.  So I sat up there for about a half hour, had the bottle of pills in my hands, turned it up and got some water and, um, the last thought I remember in my head as I was walking down the stairs to get some alcohol out of the freezer, and luckily we didn't have any and I, that's the last thought I had remembered was walking down the stairs.  I blacked out.  Next thing I know I wake up in the hospital the next day.  In between that, my parents said I walked down.  I was very, you know, out of it.  My eyes were halfway open, and they were like what's wrong?  What's wrong and I wasn't telling them, and it took my mom putting me in front of the mirror and said what have you done?  I said I took a whole bottle of Ativan, you know.  Then they had the EMS and I still don't remember any of this.  It's just a recollection.  So, coming off of that, the psychologist in the hospital came up to me and asked me if I had the means to, would I do it again and I was still delusional.  I don't remember even that, and I said yes.  Well, now I can honestly say I would never do that again.  I didn't, so they said as a result of that, and also a time last summer I told my parents that, this is when all the depression and [INAUDIBLE] came to the forefront because I had, I was feeling very suicidal and I had tried taking a whole of Tylenol PM over the summer and nothing happened.  I just slept a lot and I kept that.  I didn't tell anybody.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, you didn't tell—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, this was your second attempt?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so this was technically my second attempt.  I think the first one my justification for that one was like I felt like I could, I felt that someone would find me or somebody find out in that way 'cause I didn't feel like, I didn't feel comfortable [INAUDIBLE] like I feel like killing myself.  I just was, I felt like I had to do something before that, and it was just, it's sad that I felt like that, but I just felt like that was the one reason that I thought, didn't really think my depression was real and I did something as a result of it.  That was my reasoning behind the first time, and because it was a second attempt and I had told that under still, you know, had a bunch of Ativan in my system.  I mean I woke up and my parents said I was just being really funny in the hospital and [INAUDIBLE] like that as opposed to just being [INAUDIBLE] cracking jokes and stuff like that the entire time.  So, I look at as a blessing 'cause a traumatic time that I was at least there for some laughs, but so then they put it in the [DEIDENTIFIED] and they started me on Cymbalta, and, uh, I was very, you know, I felt really good those first two days, and then I had my seizure and then they got me on Depakote and I've been, I felt good, but I still felt a little like groggy and tired and out of it.  I mean I got to like a good amount of sleep last night.  I'm going to hurt my job.  I do respite care for a guy with cerebral palsy, and he had his PT person was over there and they were working with him and I fell asleep.  When I was just kind of laying there on the bed while they were doing the PT stuff around the table and I was just like, so I mean I still not feel like I have the full amount of energy and I don't know if that's a result of the Depakote or not, but hopefully once I get the EEG and the MRI.  If that comes back that I'm narcoleptic, then, but I mean as far as the depression goes.  I mean yeah, I still feel depressed sometimes, but I feel like there's more good days than bad days.
<b>DR:</b>	If someone said what you've been depressed about, what would you say?
<b>PT:</b>	It's a lot self esteem.  That's, that's, I just feel, sometimes I just feel down and there's no reason for it, like I just feel like so negative, but a lot of it's just I'm very hard on myself and just don't feel like—
<b>DR:</b>	Any family history of depression?
<b>PT:</b>	I think my grandmother suffers with it.  I don't think she was diagnosed with it.
<b>DR:</b>	Not your mom, dad or your siblings?
<b>PT:</b>	None of my siblings.  Both siblings are ADD, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, they are?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they're both on Adderall.  My parents don't really suffer with depression, but my grandmother does or she, cause she was able to come to me and tell, but she didn't really go to a doctor about it or anything.  I tried to get her to, but she just says she, so and that's been kind of a blessing as a result of this.  We'll kind of be able to keep each other [INAUDIBLE] and we can come to each other and be very honest [INAUDIBLE] good relationship that we can talk to each other about stuff I had gone through, but I mean as far as, I mean I do feel like this whole experience with the suicide attempt has made me more open with people and that's really been almost therapeutic just to talk to some people.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, so and I'm not used to it, so it's not been easy.  It's been, it's been the toughest I'd say over the last month since all this happened since it's been about a month, it's been the most, I've grown the most and it's also been the hardest part of my life just because, you know, [INAUDIBLE] and you know, we've had all this prayer and support which has been wonderful, but I'm like, I'm not used to be the center of attention somewhere.  I mean [INAUDIBLE] laugh and stuff like that, but I'm not like the one at the party like going around.  I like to stick to my few friends and do that, but when you have everybody coming up to you like giving you hugs and kisses, it gets kind of old after a while.  It kind of overwhelms you and everybody's like, and then, um, you know, your friends you have to tell how you been.  Like well do you really want to know how I've been?  I've been kind of been shitty this past year, but, uh, I can talk to, but it's been good also that like because of what I've gone through, I can talk to other people and they can open up to me about stuff, and that's almost kind of a therapeutic thing, and I feel like my relationships with my friends have grown deeper and with family members have grown a lot deeper, but I don't know.  It's just, it's a process.  It's like I've got this goal of going back [INAUDIBLE] to school, but I mean if the Lord, if [INAUDIBLE] I'll go there.  I mean that's okay.  I mean I'm just kind of, you got to take it day by day almost.  I mean I don't want to get caught up in the long run and not touch on the short term.  But you know, that's how it is right now.  I mean and that whole situation I can even think about when the doctor told me I couldn't drive for six months, I was, I'm known for, cause I was mad at first.  I was like this is, but you know, I've accepted it and it's like I've always, I've told myself, you know, I mean there's nothing I can do about that.  I mean so there's no sense in just getting down about it.  I could get a little depressed and it's like, you know, but I mean I'm not going to let that one instance—
<b>DR:</b>	Stop you from [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, and overcome me almost.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean in six months.  In the grand scheme of things, six months is nothing.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And my dad told me, he kind of put it in perspective, he says you can make this the best six months of your life or the worst six months of your life.  I think it'll be—
<b>DR:</b>	Sounds like you have a good relationship with your dad and mom.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's been a great thing.  I have a great relationship.  We grew up military, so, um, it's not been that we're from the same, you know, lived in the same place and had a big network of friends.  So a lot of times when you're moving around [INAUDIBLE] when you first move to a place, your family's your closest, your friends.  So, we're all, we all get along really great, and it's my sister I consider my best friend, but my brother and I are equally close too.  So, it's just—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's so nice.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's good and most people, I mean we do fight.  I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It's a real family.  It's not like we're, you know, this perfect little family, but we get along really well and we know each other so well.  It's really, I'm blessed with that.
<b>DR:</b>	How is your sleep okay now?
<b>PT:</b>	It's been good.  It's been good.
<b>DR:</b>	How is your appetite?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, normal.  It's been good, but my, the sleep I think that I really do feel like because I was sleeping normal.  That first two nights, I slept fine, and also in the treatment center, my roommate snored like a chainsaw.  It was terrible.  So I had to, so I had to get up and move, but I mean I've been kind of just a little, just a little groggy and sleeping a little bit more with the Depakote.  I really do feel like that's the—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, Depakote makes you sleepy.
<b>PT:</b>	So, yeah, but other than that, it's been, I haven't like, you know, woken up in the middle of the night or anything that weird like that, but and almost oversleeping for work, but it's been fine.
<b>DR:</b>	So you had only one seizure.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, ma'am.  Yes ma'am.
<b>DR:</b>	When you were in hospital, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, ma'am.  I go Friday for the EEG and the MRI.
<b>DR:</b>	Where do you have to go for MRI?
<b>PT:</b>	I think [DEIDENTIFIED].  So it's going to be a fun Thursday night staying up for four hours.  I mean you can only sleep for four hours.  So probably just, it's going to be interesting, and my brother's got a soccer game that night, and then I'll just watch movies or watch TV or something, keep myself busy till three in the morning, which that'll be fine, but it'll be all right.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Let's see, so medication wise, they just started you on Cymbalta?
<b>PT:</b>	They started me on Cymbalta in the treatment center and then I was on—
