<b>B</b>ad things had always happened to us in connection with water
and swimming, even though they gave us so much joy. When
we were five, the same year Porky taught us to swim, Tim broke his
leg in a little plastic wading pool in our backyard. Our father had
placed the portable pool at the bottom of a swing set slide so we
could whoosh down its hot metal and into the water in the pool, still
frothy from the green rubber garden hose that had filled it up. But
Tim's knee had somehow buckled under him on the way down, or
when he hit the water, and he landed on it in a twisted position.


No one believed his pain, though, and that very same day, he was
forced to go on a family outing to the lake. In his agony, he wouldn't
play with me, running in and out of the ebbing tide. (Does a lake
have a tide? It does now, in my scrambled memory.) I made fun of

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tim's leg was broken, of course. I could have told them that.


I knew.


Twins know.


My father, who could be said to have been responsible for the
accident in the first place, even though he put the wading pool there
for our pleasure, proudly rigged a homemade wheelchair for Tim
out of a folding chair and a furniture hand truck from the store
where he worked and paraded him around our neighborhood as
grandly as he had wheeled us around in our double stroller when we
were first born.


Another time, when our mother was driving us home from
summer swimming lessons after the first or second grade, we were
in a wreck, our mother ramming our car into one that had stopped
suddenly in front of us. That morning in swim class, a hysterical
mother had made the teacher jump in to save her little girl, who was
straggling behind in the water. "My baby! My baby! She's
drowning!" She wasn't; she was just slow. Tim and I, entertainers at
an early age, had been doing imitations of that for our mother—at
least <i>she</i> hadn't been the one screaming and embarrassing us—when
metal slammed into metal.


In our wrecked car, with whiplash, she drove us to the emergency
ward. We were fine (terrified, guilty perhaps, but not hurt), but that
memory kept us both from swimming for many years afterward.


Whatever one of us did, the other did, too.


We both got scared of the water for a while and quit swimming,
connecting it in our minds to an inevitable disaster.


In the fourth grade, I broke my right arm jumping across a water-filled
drainage ditch at the end of our block, a contest with the

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Without a drop of water on me, I landed on the other side with
my right arm held straight out against the earth; I saw my forearm
literally fold in on itself at impact. I clamped my left arm on top of
the now-hinged right arm to flatten it out, then held both arms
tightly against my stomach as I walked the half block home, crying,
my eyes closed. Neighbors out on their porches asked if I needed
help. The other jumpers trailed behind me, too afraid to come up
close, as if they'd be blamed, but dogging me with questions
nonetheless: "You okay? What's wrong? You shouldn'ta put your arm
out like that."


Our mother—now the hysterical one, when I showed her how I
could bend my arm in three places—took me to the same doctor
who had swathed Tim's leg in gauze and warm plaster a few years
earlier. I still remember the warmth of getting that cast put on, the
wooziness from the pain shot the doctor gave me. Tim was the first
person to sign my cast, as I had been the first to sign his.


I sometimes even <i>think</i> I remember our birth: me, swimming
around in our mother's womb, then shooting out first—not because
of any great courage, but because Tim chickened out at the last
minute, a scaredy-cat of dry land <i>and</i> of leaving the comforting water
of the womb. "Come on out, it's great on shore," I call back, more to
convince myself than a statement of fact. I'd say anything to have
Tim follow me, even though I don't know what waits for us in the
outside world. Tim does, though, and that's why he wants to stay
inside; he's a lot smarter than I am, even in the womb. The heart

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He should have stayed in.


Twins know.


Hoping, praying Tim would answer his door in person even if he
wouldn't pick up the phone, I left Frank's office and took a cab to
the apartment where Tim was staying, his third in as many months.
Notice I don't say "his apartment": nothing connected to Tim was
his; everything was temporary, on loan, this apartment more than
others. He had moved from sublet to sublet during his two years in
New York, but something always happened, and he would burn yet
another bridge behind him while he found the next place to pitch
camp. I had found him the current apartment by going through my
address book and calling everyone I knew, ending with my friend
Liz, who needed a roommate—and whose last name began with W.
By the time I got to her, I'd reached the end of my patience with
Tim, and the end of the alphabet. When she said, "Now don't be
offended, but I have to ask: does he use drugs?" I almost laughed but
stifled myself; if I told the truth, he'd be homeless. "Oh, no ma'am,
he doesn't touch the devil's weed. Oh, yes ma'am, he's so blotto he
can barely stand up. But does anybody really think alcohol is a <i>drug?</i>"


The apartment was way up and over on the Upper East Side, huge
and fortresslike, with different wings branching out from a gigantic
concrete courtyard, like some militaristic, Fascist building from the
'30s. Big and anonymous, a perfect setting for Tim to disappear in

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A set of exterior stairs zigzagged up the outside stucco walls to
each floor, and I heaved up the four flights to his apartment, actually
welcoming the strain in my thighs because it gave me something to
focus on besides the buzz in my head, the ricocheting thoughts that
Tim was dead. "Twins know," I wrote earlier, but now I'm not so
sure. I knew he was gone, but not where. I thought he was dead and
didn't, at the same time. That's the other thing twins do, or don't:
they don't—they <i>can't</i>—think their other half is gone forever.


His metal door, at the top of the stairs, wasn't ominously open;
there were no scratches or gouges on it, no streaks of blood, as I'd
feared. I knocked softly at first, then pounded it with the side of my
palm, then the knuckles, then switched back to the side of my fist,
harder, deeper, madder. "Tim, come on. PLEASE. Open up. It's me.
It's alright. <i>Please</i>. Just open the door." There was still no answer.


I went back downstairs to see if the super could let me in; maybe
he'd seen my little show, seen how serious this was. But once I found
him, he insisted Tim didn't live there, more with sign language and
grunts than English. I tried to explain how Tim was the new roommate
of Liz W's, the girl in 43R—maybe he just hadn't met him
yet?—but he retaliated by showing me a black binder with tenants'
Polaroid pictures in it. Liz herself was so many generations removed
from the original tenant she wasn't even pictured; there was no way
Tim was in it. I went from zero to sixty in no time flat and yelled I'd
call the police if that's the only way I could get in.


He grunted some more.


I took that as his "go ahead."


At the nearest pay phone I could find, I dialed 911 for the first
time in my life.

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I want to report a possible missing person."


"Possible." That must mean I still had hope, even though I don't
think I did.


"Why do you think the person is missing, or in trouble? Has he
been sick, or depressed?"


"He has tried to kill himself before." Somehow I knew to be very
precise, very careful, not use contractions; I knew to take the operator's
lead and follow the same careful, calm, spelled-out script she
was reading. If I matched my rhythm to hers, maybe she'd help me
faster. I made my voice and words sound even and steady, even if my
heart wasn't.


"Yes, he has tried to kill himself before."


"Okay, good. That's what I needed to know. Now we can get to
work." <i>We</i> can get to work; she would make it a team effort. <i>He</i> has
tried to hurt himself before; that was the key that unlocked everything.
(And if he <i>hadn't</i> tried to hurt himself before—would she have
hung up on me?)


Get to work we did, this angel I envisioned as a big black woman,
the fat dangling from her upper arms belying the strength she called
on whenever she got a distress signal from a little white boy like me.
She told me to wait for the police, so I did, standing behind the
columns in front of the apartment complex, dreading what we'd find
once we got inside.


I had been in the apartment only once before. Tim had had some
kind of trouble with his contact lenses, his eyes had become infected,
and he'd missed work—again. I was taking him money—again—to
go to a doctor.

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The apartment was a mess, cramped and overheated. I had found
Tim there, crumpled like Pinocchio after his strings had been cut,just
as they had been cut when our father retrieved him from school and
carried him home the night of his breakdown, along with a single
green trash bag crammed with the few things worth keeping. Now I,
not my father, had been forced into the role of Gepetto, old before my
time, and Tim was the little wooden boy, knowing he'd done wrong.
His eyes were squinting, his face red and chapped, but whether it was
from crying or a broken thermostat, I didn't know. He was in his
closet of a bedroom, sitting on a lone mattress on the floor, piled high
with more green trash bags, his version of a suitcase ever since college.


He pulled himself up and tried to rush me out of the apartment
but, as if overcome by the heat, gave up and collapsed into a chair. I
had seen the mess; the damage was done; we might as well stay. I was
embarrassed for my friend Liz whose apartment this was, and she
wasn't even here to see the mess. I couldn't help but think she hadn't
been there in weeks, or she'd have already kicked him out, drugs or
no drugs. I had seen her wear velvet dresses and jaunty little hats
with pearls and gloves; a person who dressed like that surely couldn't
live in a dump like this.


Tim kept asking if I loved him, if I was mad at him.


The truth would have killed him.


It was killing me.


The job was too big. Restoring the apartment, restoring Tim. I
couldn't do either one of them anymore.


The police finally arrived. Sean was Irish, with a sort of "faith and
begorrah" accent, red hair,pale skin, and even paler bule eyes; Dave

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I assumed they'd have some sort of universal key to get us in, but
they were no better equipped than I was. They jiggled the doorknob,
peered around the balcony-like landing to see if there was a window
they could climb through, all the things I'd already tried.


Maybe <i>they</i> could force the super to let us in.


We trotted back to him and I repeated my story, to this man who
was so proud of his archaic Polaroids, his precious little black book.
But the police made no difference: the super didn't even <i>have</i> a key.
There were two locks on each door, and only the tenant had the
key to the top one. Tim's roommate Liz had one, but she was
nowhere to be found. We'd have to get a locksmith, and come back
the next day.


All four of us—the cops, the stupid super, <i>and</i> I—were shocked
when I said it didn't matter when we got in, because we'd still find
the same thing: nothing, or Tim's body.


I actually said that.


The police took me back to their station house. Sean asked if Tim
was having girlfriend problems. I played word games and said he
didn't have a girlfriend, worried they'd quit searching if they knew
he was gay, or I was. But no, they were sure he'd show up, he must
have had a fight with a friend or his boss, gone somewhere to sort

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They didn't get it: Tim was gone.


I knew.


Twins know.


What would the rest of the conjugation be? Twins <i>had</i> known?


Our mother—a tiny, high-strung woman of forty, her dark bangs cut
straight across her forehead like Joan of Arc's and already flecked
with gray—had discovered there were two children on the way just
a few weeks before we were born. We were so little, weighing only
three pounds each and folded in on each other, that the doctor had
thought she was carrying only one child with some sort of echoing
heartbeat.


Two babies, not one, so late in life, twelve years after her first child.


Maybe that's when, and why, she started going crazy, a school-teacher
whose life was already swarming with unruly kids.


Maybe that's when, and why, our father—a self-taught Yankee
transplanted to the South, with dreams of building a ranch house just
like the Ponderosa on <i>Bonanza</i>—started drinking.


Porky, already twelve when we were born, was given the perk of
naming us, to make up for the lack of attention he was getting. He
started work on our names with fierce concentration, in that last
stretch of weeks before we were born. But in the end, his choice was
easy: he would name us after his two best friends, both male, who
stood next to him in the marching band in which he played both
trombone and tuba: Kim, who had been named after Rudyard
Kipling's <i>Kim</i>, and Joe Bob, the default Texan, Southern Baptist

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In later years, after I learned the story of our naming and had forgiven
Porky for the curse of growing up in Texas with the name
Kim, I wondered how the left-out Joe Bob felt, when he first saw us:
did he know how narrowly he had missed out on becoming part of
the family legacy, or was that a surprise Porky had been planning but
never got to reveal?


Many years later, in our adult years, I made videos of some old
Super 8 home movies for Christmas presents for Tim and Porky. In
them, Tim and I rolled around in our cribs, two blobs of flesh in diapers;
Porky took one look at the babies on the screen and said it was
impossible to know which of us was which then. I took one look at
the blobs of flesh and said it was no trouble at all. I knew who I was.
So did Tim. I was the one on the right, Tim on the left.


Twins know.


Twins had known?


Have I said that already?


It was night by the time I got back home to Brooklyn. Jess, a theater
costume designer, was out of town on a job, as he so often seemed
to be in those days, during my moments of crisis with Tim. The only
thing to do was start returning the phone calls that had stacked up
during the day, answers—or not—to my SOS's. First, the easy ones:
" Dan M." who, according to Tim's Day-At-A-Glance was supposed
to have drinks with Tim that night. I'd called him earlier in the day

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

No shit, Sherlock.


My brother carries his belongings in trash bags, and you have nice
furniture, and a lover who's a doctor, to rub in his face.


No wonder he ran away.


"This is all my fault," Peter said again, almost wanting me to agree.


"No it's not," I said, even though I thought it was.


"If only I had... I should have known what was going on. I
should have stopped him."


"It's okay. Really." An exhalation of silent tears came out, that I
took back as quickly as I inhaled. "Where the fuck is he?"


"He needs help, Kim. He really does."


What I said: "I know."


What I <i>wanted</i> to say, but didn't, too afraid of offending someone:
"Tell me something I don't already know. You're supposed to be so
fucking smart, with your plays and everything, tell me something I
don't already the fuck know. ‘He needs help.’ Jesus."


Before I actually <i>did</i> say any of that, I got off the phone.


I had put off calling Porky until now; I always put off calling my
to-the-point older brother, holding down his fancy government job
in Washington, until I absolutely had to. But he wasn't home, so I

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Porky did call, an hour or so later, I finally let everything
come spilling out: "Tim is dead. I know it." And then, a weird P.S. to
follow that: "I hate him. I hate him!" I screamed and raged against
Tim, finally had the high school hissy fit that had been simmering
in wait for years and a day, this day: the abuse, the destruction, the
drinking, the being my brother's keeper. I knew the Bible said I was
supposed to do it, but I couldn't anymore.


Porky said he'd fly in tomorrow if necessary. And why wouldn't it
be? What was going to change? On the other hand, what was he
going to do? Help me search a city he hated, rarely visited, and
barely knew, even though his baby brothers lived there, struggling to
stay alive? It would be far easier if Tim were lost in Paris, a city Porky
loved and flew to at the drop of the hat, a city whose name was
stamped on every single inserted page of his bulging passport.


I hung up, now as pissed off at Porky as I was at Tim.


Pissed off at a dead person. You couldn't get much angrier than that.


Only to Jess, on the phone, did I confess my guiltiest secret: that I
had already prayed to God that Tim didn't feel any pain when he died.


Because dead was the only answer to where Tim was.


I couldn't make any more calls.

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I couldn't tell the story one more time.


I couldn't keep asking the same questions, and getting the same
answers: "No, I haven't seen him."


"No, I don't know where he is."


"No, but I'm sure he'll show up, he always does."


"No, he won't, not this time." That would be me talking.


But I couldn't not do <i>something</i>. A missing person's poster. I could
do that...and the minute I thought of it, the memory of a sad, desperate
family I had once seen came to me, frantically handing out
makeshift flyers with their little girl's picture on them, at a mall in
Texas. But instead of that poor white-trash family, now it would be
me handing the flyers out, white trash myself but trying to cover that
up. Instead of a cute little blond girl in a Sears photo on it, there
would be a twenty-eight-year-old man who used to be blond, curly
blond, when he was a laughing, happy baby. I have the pictures. I can
prove we used to be happy.


I went to my file cabinet for a picture and began sorting through
them: Tim in his many phases—bearded or clean-shaven; wearing
glasses or contact-lensed; playful or serious; artist, or young scholar,
in his atelier. But there was a problem: we were together in nearly all
of them. It was the twin curse; you don't even get a picture to call
your own. I'd have to cut them in two, like an angry divorcee banishing
any trace of the former husband, and take in just half to the
police.


In that assortment of old family photos, I could literally trace the
timeline, the history, that had brought us to this day.


The earliest: a picture of the three sons taken when Tim and I
were less than a year old; it went on our family Christmas card the
year we were born. Tim and I are propped up on either side of
Porky, on the couch in the living room. Centered by a creaky old air

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Click, the next picture: our third birthday, we're dressed identically,
on a lakeshore in Vermont, our father's country. An aunt has made
two cakes, both in the shape of little lambs who graze on pastures of
dyed green coconut. In separate high chairs, we coo and stroke the
lambs with our pudgy little fingers and smile for the cameras.


Click, our fourth birthday, back home in Texas: we're in color-coordinated
shorts and Banlon shirts, Tim's rust orange, mine
green, banging our fists into jelly bean cakes of our own design—
white-frosted cakes with multicolored jellybeans stuck in the
icing. I remember picking out the yellow and green jelly beans to
eat, and leaving the rest.


Click, our fifth birthday: we're climbing on an old army tank
memorial at Finch Park, where a nearby picnic table is covered with
a paper tablecloth—Batman that year—that's weighted down by
cupcakes and presents. Our kindergarten friends are there; the next

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Click, our seventh birthday: wait, there's no picture of that, but I'll
describe what it would have shown: me, with seven wasp stings
whelping my uncovered arms and legs, after I had gotten out of our
car when I wasn't supposed to and played in the bushes at the post
office the day of our birthday, while our mother was inside on an
errand.


That's the last picture she could have been in; she would be dead
by the time we reached our eighth birthday.


What pictures—without her—would come next?


Me, an eight-year-old four-eyes in thick black glasses, literally not
able to see anymore. I was terrified of having the school nurse come
in for routine eye checks; I faked being able to see the blackboard by
asking classmates, as long as possible, what was on it. By then, it had
become the nurse's witch hunt to get me into glasses. When I finally
got them, Tim did, too. Like I said, whatever one of us did, we both
did: we both went blind at the same time. Driving us home from
getting the glasses fitted, my father asked how I was adjusting to
them. This was my all-knowing answer, from my eight-year-old
mouth: "Now I can see far too well."


Daddy thought it was cute.


He didn't know I was just telling the truth.


What other pictures never got taken, that might help me find my
missing brother?


These pictures, to prove how much I loved him, how we once
depended on each other, shared everything: late at night, just before

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If I told that to Sean and Dave, would they look harder for Tim,
or run from me, recoiling in disgust and horror?


Or what if I had a picture of this, in a darker shade: Tim and me
playing our favorite made-up game, "Baggy Pants and the Electricity
Lady." One of us—and we would switch roles back and forth—
would put on a pair of our father's baggy pajamas and be the victim,
Baggy Pants; the other would put on one of our mother's night-gowns
and become the Electricity Lady, who threatened to electrocute
Baggy Pants with the long, thick electrical cord that hooked up
the air conditioner in our bedroom. The cord only reached so far,
but Baggy Pants naively, stupidly stayed within its perimeter, as the
Electricity Lady feinted and jabbed at him. Baggy Pants hopped
around, futilely trying to evade the cord, but the end was always the
same: he died, the second she touched him.


Where did two little boys get that, the idea of a woman always
trying to kill a man, and the man not putting up any fight to save his
life, two people whose very touch was lethal to each other? No
wonder I willed myself into going blind; I didn't want to see what
was going on between my parents.

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Or maybe this picture, never taken with a camera but seared into
my mind: our whole family, watching <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> on a big-screen
color TV set at the downtown furniture/appliance store
where our father worked. Dorothy and her friends are fighting off
sleep as they cross the field of poppies, when Tim wanders off and
finds a box of rat poison buried along a baseboard. He's a smart
boy—at six, he already knows that if he eats it, it will make him sick,
or even kill him—but he wants to try it anyway. He thinks he's
invincible, that nothing will happen to him. He picks up the box and
starts to empty the powder into his palm, just as our father walks by,
looking for him.


Years later, in telling me that story, Tim said he wanted to see if he
could survive it.


That's a photo I'm glad I'm not in, a picture of one of the twins,
finally, by himself: a little boy about to lick rat poison off his palm,
to prove he could survive death.


I gave up on the photos, both real and imagined, and was about to
slam the file cabinet shut when I saw the crumbling pages of Tim's
letters to me over the years. More than any pictures, I wondered if
they told where he was, held clues I might have missed, images that
never needed to be clues before.


I started looking through them—the paper of some so brittle it
broke off at my touch—for one in particular, from the summer just
before Tim's breakdown, the summer before he "went swimming."
It was after our junior year in college, 1978, when Tim spent the
summer in Texas at a theater called Mo Ranch our college was just
starting, and I worked at a bigwig professional theater in Williamstown,

We were twenty years old, and it was the first time we'd ever spent
longer than two weeks apart.

<i>Dar air is very thin, here on Der Magic Mountain. An hour ago I arrived
vith my valise packed in abundance vith mutton sandwich and borscht. The
feeling comes—vhere does it arrive from or vence?—that I may live here
through a Vorld Var and write a mastervork in my crabbed yet inimitable,
dialectical style. There are not many of us left. As you vell know, ve are a
dying class, my pale-cheeked bushkin. Herr Doktor Narramore showed me
my accommodations—very adequate and sanitary. Yet I am disturbed by der
thought of der many tuberculors who have died here. The crowd—flotsam
and jetsam of der Europe ve once knew—is interesting: a fading actress who
vas directed by Chekhov; her young protégée, a ninny of a girl doting on her
every word; an adventurer or two; the usual opportunists; and the like. Vell,
I must retire now. I have been here but an hour and yet it seems like an eternity.
My cough has returned. Vhat can that mean? The air is so thin</i>.


<i>Well, brother, it is both good and eighth-grade-paranoia bad today in the
natural splendor of San Antonio's Hill Country. Our classmate/leading lady

of the hard Hill Country earth: hey, kids, let's put on a show! We can use

<i>At one point this week, a small black child attending camp here came up
to me. His name was Brent, and he had the boyish good looks of a young
Poitier</i>.


<i>He asked, "Does you have any bruvahs or sistahs?"</i>


<i>I, whose boyish good looks have long since disappeared, answered, "I have
a brother named Kim. This is a letter I'm writing to him."</i>


<i>Brent, no doubt dazzled by the thought of long distance, asked, "Is he in
de army?</i>


<i>My answer was immediate, "No. He is an actor."</i>


<i>At times, you seem so far away that I, too, am dazzled by thoughts of
your long distance. Oh, Kim. I am so glad you are my brother. At the first
of the summer, you called me a "vicious monster." I realize now that that is
partially true. I've been far too self-indulgent over the past two years and am
responsible for most of my unhappiness, and possibly some of yours. As are
we all, I think, in the long run. Forgive me. I will not blame society or civilization;
it is not going to be that simple. Sometimes I wish for a complete
breakdown. It would be nice to fall completely apart and have someone else
put me back together. But luxuries like that don't come easily, and probably
many more problems would result</i>.


<i>I think these letters will be important in the long run. We decided upon
some sort of battle years ago. Today, I feel we reach discerning years. I think</i>

<i>I loves you, bruvah. Is you in de army?</i>


<i>Tim</i>


The scariest thing about that letter? Not the fact that we used to
love each other so much, my heart wants to break. Not the fact that
he wished for a nervous breakdown, and then had one. No. The
scariest thing is that I didn't have the slightest memory (this from a
boy who remembers everything) of calling him a "vicious monster."
After he moved to New York, and was drunk more often than not,
those words would always be at the tip of my tongue, ready to come
darting out. But then, in college? It must have been worse than I
remember.


"These letters will be important in the long run," he wrote. "We
decided upon some sort of battle years ago. Today, I feel we reach discerning
years." Tim stated our battle as a fact for the first time that
summer before the breakdown, but he could only do it through the
anonymity of long-distance pen and paper, not face-to-face. I couldn't
do it either way, but I knew it was there. And I didn't know why.


That was the biggest, saddest mystery of all, one I didn't know if
I was already too late to solve.


In a house where so little was acknowledged or said, we'd always
depended on family letters to find out the truth about things, beginning
with Porky's letters from our mother. When we were little, and
he was away at college—we were just starting grade school when he

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Whether it was Porky's room and the reminder of security it gave
us, or the connection to our mother through the letters, I don't know,
but Porky's bedroom became our safe place. We existed as we had in
the womb when we were there, unconscious of our elbows and
shoulders colliding into each other as we rolled into the middle of the
sagging bed. I found there what Tim later found in the water: my own
private world, a world suspended, a world of no cares or worries, of
happier times. We never dared leave the sanctuary of Porky's room
with his letters for fear we'd be found out; we wouldn't even talk in
there, afraid our whispers would alert the house to our trespasses.
Nothing could give us away, but nothing could keep us from coming
back, to try and keep our mother alive, at least in our memories. We
called her "Mama" as children, but after her death, we switched to
calling her "Mother," as if it were more respectful. "Mother" became
the sainthood name, "Our Mother" who art in heaven.

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In that room, in an often-stuck, water-warped drawer, Porky kept
mementos from "Mother's" life: a gold watch-pendant on a chain; a
ruby-encrusted bracelet; a necklace—clear glass beads that turned
yellow or turquoise or pink depending on how you held them to the
light—the most memorable pieces retrieved from her cornucopia of
costume jewelry. The day after she died, I walked around the neighborhood,
clutching a big fat purse filled with her jewelry. I showed
it to the neighbor ladies and said, "These could be yours if you play
your cards right." Where I picked up that phrase, or dared to use it,
at seven years old, I don't know; I was Dill, the little Truman Capote
of Woodleigh Drive.


In that same drawer, Porky also kept our mother's last grade book
from school, the school year not yet finished when she died; scattered
classroom pictures, our mother sporting a different hairstyle in
each one; and lying uncertainly on top, like an afterthought, the register
of guests from her funeral. Things purloined for remembrance
from a lifetime of artifacts, left there for safekeeping, or as a lure to
keep us coming back.


One night, our mother had some sort of spell and was laid out in
Porky's room, not able to make it to her own. Laid out there, or
sought it herself, like an animal seeking its final resting place before
it dies, knowing its time has come? The family doctor, Jim Wilson,
was sitting at the bedside, taking her pulse and asking her to count
backward from ten, to name the day, the current president. Porky
and our father were there, as Tim and I cowered in the hallway, the
adults too caught up in the emergency at hand to block our way.


It was never explained to us what had happened.


Our mother was crazy. One time, I saw her scream the "Divine
Apostle Paul" was telling her to beat my father with a frying pan,
which she did, as he raised his spindly arms over his head in defense.

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One of the final weeks before she died, Porky took us on a
weekend vacation, an escape from the betrayals and drunkenness of
our father, to the fantastic sounding Aquamarina Springs near San
Antonio. In our hotel room, we watched the Tony Curtis movie
<i>Houdini</i> (and I took in more about escape and death, and mothers
and sons) and saw make-believe mermaids underwater as we rode in
a glass-bottom boat. On our way back home, we ate in an A-frame-shaped
restaurant called Shangri-la, a concept of Utopia Porky
patiently explained to us, and made us think could be ours, as we
stirred sugar into our iced tea with long, swirl-handled silver spoons.


With Porky and our mother, we saw <i>Mary Poppins</i> on New Year's Eve
and emerged after midnight from a Dallas movie theater into a fog as
thick and mysterious as that on the streets of London we had just seen,
not knowing it would be the last movie we would ever see with her.


Soon after that, she whisked us away to the nearby town of Plano
to look at an apartment near her sister's giant, rambling farmhouse.
Tim and I bounced on a giant bed in a bedroom that had a beautiful
glass sculpture of grapes on a mirrored bureau. We wanted to
live there, just because the grapes were so pretty. Out of earshot of
the real estate agent, we were told never to tell our father about the
trip, that we might soon be living someplace else, without our father.


We didn't, and a week after that, our mother was dead.


I don't think Tim ever recovered.

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Enough already. Enough with the past. Enough with the dead
mother. Your brother is missing—now. <i>Do</i> something. Words on
paper, airy-fairy memories of sad childhoods—who the fuck didn't
have one?—aren't going to help. A poster; that's gonna help. More
calls, those'll help too.


Do something.


But there was nothing left to do, except try to figure out what had
brought us to this place.


That meant thinking.


That meant remembering.


And what I remembered—what I had tried to make myself forget all
day long, with my beautiful, poignant, feel-sorry-for-me memories—
was that this was all my fault.


"Why," you ask?


"I'll tell you," says the twin who tells everything.


Just a few weeks ago, I had gone out for drinks with a friend and
come back to find Tim in the apartment. Jess was out of town; Tim
had let himself in with his own key. He was drunk and delirious as
he struggled to sit up on the couch, mumbling the phrase, "Oh yes,
I have adapted all my life" over and over again.


From nowhere, he kept saying that phrase.


One of our rusty kitchen knives shook in his hands; I wrenched
it away so he couldn't finish the job he had so recently attempted,
cutting myself in the process when I grabbed the blade. When the
knife fell to the floor, he grabbed one of the beer bottles he had
brought with him and tried to smash it, so he could use the jagged
edge on his wrist, or maybe on me. As I tried to save his life, or mine,

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have never been so sad, so ready to die.


"Our mother, our mother...she left us..." He screamed about
that mysterious night neither one of us could forget, when she was
laid out in Porky's room, and a doctor tried to revive her, and we
never found out what was going on.


"I have tried to put pen to paper about that night, pen to paper,
but the words won't come...the ink dries up...my blood dries
up...."


He screamed and cursed and ranted for half an hour, until, drunk
and exhausted, he finally fell asleep on his own. I sat up against the
hard wall in the living room to keep watch, to keep him from trying
to kill himself again, but I, too, finally dozed off, no better in a pinch
than the disciples who fell asleep when they were supposed to be
guarding Christ after the Last Supper.


In the morning,Tim left for work, but there was no sense that the
crisis had been averted or that he had slept it off; if anything, it
seemed even worse. Surviving the night had not saved him, it had
just brought him to another day to try all over again. I couldn't hold
him back, as much as I tried; he pulled away and smiled at me, saying
he still wanted to die, instead of saying good-bye.


When is a good-bye not really a good-bye, but a curse? When it's
your twin brother saying he'll probably be dead before you see him
again, and then smiling in your face and closing a heavy metal door
behind him.

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That door clanged shut, and I called a friend who had seen shrinks
all his life, who had a laundry list of them to recommend, to see what
steps I needed to take to have Tim committed.


But I didn't follow through on any of them.


Instead, later that day, I called Tim and told him that if he didn't
change, didn't quit drinking, didn't pull it together, I was prepared to
"cast him out of my life"—ah, now the language really gets Biblical,
locusts and pestilence and threats, oh my.


Prepared, I said, but could I have really done it?


It doesn't matter; the choice has been made for me. A choice I
forced Tim into. I told him I would leave him; he saved me the
bother and left me instead.


His life, or death, my fault.


So you see, there really was nothing left to do, except go to bed
and pray, once again, that Tim didn't feel any pain when he died.
