SOMETHING new was added the next morning. A
student nurse peered in my half-opened door just after breakfast.
"Dr. Anders wants to see you in his office as soon as possible,"
she said. "I am to take you there."


Wow! I thought to myself. The nurse's notes about yesterday's
visit must have been really copious. Dr. Anders would
have plenty to say.


I felt chagrined, yet stirred by a feeling this was something
special for him to request an extra appointment. "I'll be right
with you," I told the nurse. "Give me a second to get dressed."


I skimmed into skirt and waist, flipped a brush over my hair,
plastered some lipstick in the general direction of my mouth,
raced to the nurse in the living room and asked, "Why can't I go
to Dr. Anders' office alone? I've been doing it right along."


"Not today, Mrs. Rhodes. I'm sorry. I guess Dr. Anders thinks
you were too upset yesterday."


We arrived at his office, my excitement mounting with each
step; my fear, too, of what he was going to say. The nurse
knocked on the door and he opened it. He beckoned me inside
to the overstuffed red leather chair facing his desk. I watched as
he stuffed the bowl of his pipe with tobacco (he had lately
changed from cigarettes to a pipe, afraid of cancer, perhaps),
fumbled in his pocket for a match (I would have offered him
one had I been a smoker) and then lit the stinking mixture.

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally he sat back in his wooden chair, looked at me and
asked, "What's wrong, Mrs. Rhodes?"


"Not much," I said sarcastically. "Why did you take away my
doctor's office privileges so that I had to be led here by the
nose?"


"Do you think I should not have?"


More of the psychiatrist's weapons--the patient asks a question,
he answers with a question. The hell with him. I said
nothing.


"I spoke to your parents yesterday," he said.


"Good for you!" I didn't try to hide my sneer. "So did I. I
hope you had better luck with them than I did."


He did not answer. I stared at the Picasso print of mother and
child. I felt he was watching me so I looked back at him and
said deliberately, "I am very nearsighted. I should take off my
glasses and stare at you, too. Then I could make you uncomfortable
without even realizing you were staring at me."


"Does it bother you?"


"Why, Dr. Anders, what a ridiculous question! Of course
not."


I was sure he caught my sarcasm. He said nothing. We sat in
silence sublime. Then he volunteered, "I'll take you back to the
hall now."


I wanted to say, "Don't bother. I can find my way. I have,
often enough." But I stood up and waited for him to open the
door.


We walked in the same silence back to my locked hall. I
wondered why he had asked to see me. He certainly had said
nothing. Perhaps he wanted me to spout out words. Words to
me were a gift to the other person. I did not want to give him
anything.


The next day Dr. Anders himself came to the locked hall for
my session. Instead of going to his office, we walked down the
corridor to the music room and sat there.


"Are you still so angry, Mrs. Rhodes?" he asked.

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Yes, I am." I took off my glasses with a flourish and stared at
his blurred image.


He waited for me to say something. I did not. When the quiet
became oppressive, I tried to occupy myself with my thoughts.
Why didn't I want to speak to him? I was not sure. It occurred
to me maybe I was trying to control him by being a difficult
patient so he would have to spend more time with me. I knew I
wanted him to be stronger and brighter than I. It was most
important that he, not I, control the situation. I wondered why I
went out of my way to make it tough for him to help me when I
really did want his assistance very much. Perhaps he knew this,
in spite of my hostile behavior.


I broke the silence. "Dr. Anders, I don't want to parade my
neuroses anymore. I don't feel like talking. I don't have anything
against you personally. I'm just tired of psychiatrists. I
wish you were a plumber."


"Why?"


"I'm weary of talking about myself and my problems. I would
like to discuss something else for a change. Anything that has no
relation to me."


"What would you suggest?"


"The price of eggs in China. Or Dr. Chandler's dog. By the
way, I didn't mean to force you into seeing me every day because
I was angry. I'm sorry you had to come all this way to see
me today." Was I? This certainly set me apart from the rest of
the patients who only saw <i>their</i> psychiatrist three times a week
and in the psychiatrist's office. <i>He</i> had come to see <i>me</i>.


Dr. Anders looked at his watch. "I can't give you the full time
today. I'll take you back to your room." At my door he said, "I'll
see you the day after tomorrow."


"Fine." I waved good-bye as though to a plumber.


The rest of the day went slowly. I thought about Dr. Anders'
coming to my hall and how very nasty I had been. I wondered if
perhaps what I thought of gratefully as his kindness was actually
his acceptance of my difficult personality. I suspected perhaps I
appreciated him so much, and my parents so little, because he

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I hated myself for believing my mother and father were
inadequate as parents. I wanted to cry out of deep pity for these
two miserable people who could not help themselves, much less
me, their black-sheep child.


I had always felt my world a rather empty, useless one. But
now, with a baby and husband, more would be expected of me.
Niles expected a lot of himself as a doctor, and of me as a wife
and mother. But did I <i>want</i> to invest more of myself? And was I
<i>capable</i> of investing more? Behind all my bravado and sarcasm
lay the all-pervasive, sinking feeling that I was a failure as a
woman, that I was not up to meeting the demands of motherhood
and wifedom. How did I have the gall ever to dare try?
What in my unworthy, tempestuous life gave me the courage to
think I could direct and discipline another human being, my
little Kathy?


It seemed all my life had been one mock performance. I was
always trying to meet someone else's expectations. I had been
acting out a part for others so long that I did not know what
was true for myself.


But this I knew: I was going to stop performing for anyone
like a trained seal until I found out what I wanted. And "anyone"
included Dr. Anders.


Now, what did I have left? Nothing. Nobody. I saw no way
out. My parents were not going to help me escape from this
prison and Dr. Anders seemed unconcerned at my agony. Again
I felt I must be the one to act, and drastically, to show everyone
I meant what I said, <i>that I could not tolerate being locked up</i>.


There was one way everyone understood as a plea for help. I
only tried it when I felt backed up against a wall facing the
firing squad.


When the nurse doled out sedatives at bedtime, I slipped the

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wondered if I could sleep through the night without medication.
At eleven, when the rounds were made, I lay wide
awake. I debated whether to ask for a repeat of the medicine
and actually swallow it and get some sleep, or to request medication
and hide a second pill. What a ludicrous decision to have
to make! If I decided to go ahead and try to kill myself, what in
heaven's name did it matter if I didn't get much sleep for the
next couple of days until I had saved up a lethal dose? If I
decided not to commit suicide, a few nights of wakefulness
would do me no harm. I might even take off a few of those
pernicious pounds.


I asked for a second pill, the nurse handed it to me and I hid
this one in the Kleenex box all by itself.


The following night I went through the same procedure. But
by this time I knew I was not going to kill myself, even though
that had been my impulse the night before. I thought wryly that
if I did swallow all at once the pills I could accumulate over a
few weeks, I probably would die without a chance of rescue,
since the attendants did not look too closely at me during the
night. They would never discover whether I was comatose, dead
or asleep.


The next morning I cornered the head nurse. "Miss Fitzgerald,
I have something for you," I said. Perhaps I was trying to
repay her kindness when she had sat down next to me on the
bathroom floor of the occupational therapy room. "Can you
come with me?"


"Sure," she said, smiling and looking prettier than ever.


We walked into my room and the head nurse sat on the edge
of the bed. I picked up the Kleenex box and ceremoniously
placed it beside her as though giving her the treasured contents

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"In those two boxes," I announced, "you will find a number
of sleeping pills, Miss Fitzgerald. I am giving them to you
because, while I can handle them safely now, I might get an
impulse to kill myself some day soon. And those night attendants
with their cursory glances would never know if I were
dead or alive."


She removed the pills from the boxes and looked at them
thoughtfully as she held them in the palm of her hand. She did
not castigate me. Instead she said, "You really could do anything
you want if you put your mind to it. It would be no problem for
you to kill yourself on this hall, Mrs. Rhodes. You could even do
it on the maximum security unit."


"I know," I said. "That's why I gave the pills to you. I don't
want to die." Then I asked worriedly, "What will you do with
them?"


She smiled again. "Throw them away."


She stood up and, as she walked out said, "I'm glad you gave
them back, Mrs. Rhodes."


My psychiatrist's office privileges were not returned to me
and now I was always either escorted to Dr. Anders by a nurse
or he came to the music room and we held a session there. I
asked Miss Fitzgerald why this privilege was still being withheld.
She said, "You can't expect to walk right away on a leg you
have broken, can you?" I suppose she was saying my psyche was
broken and had to heal.


Adding to my unhappiness, although I was glad for her sake,
Sue was transferred to the open hall, a sign of success for it
meant she would be trusted with more responsibility, able to
come and go as she pleased. I missed her very much, although I
still had Elise and Beth with whom to compare notes. But there
was no denying our trio now lacked a gay fourth. Sue was moody
but she was also witty and quick to laugh when she felt happy,
contributing to everyone's sense of fun.

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Niles was due east any day and I wondered why he didn't call
from Chicago in anticipation of his homecoming. He wrote
warm letters but that was not the same as hearing his voice. I
didn't phone him because during the hours I could have
reached him at night we were not allowed to use the telephone
and other times it was difficult to get him at the hospital.


The day on which Mother said he was expected at our house,
when I awoke I felt so tired I could hardly pull myself out of
bed. I did not feel like getting dressed or talking to a soul. It
was raining and the buildings looked grizzly gray, fitting in with
my gloom. Although I had no scheduled hour with Dr. Anders,
I told one of the nurses I would like to see him. She came back
to report he was not at Lanier that day.


Late in the afternoon, after occupational therapy, I gave up
and lay down on the bed. I stared at the pale yellow walls, an
insipid, murky shade, like a New Hampshire sky before a summer
storm. The walls seemed to sway as I studied them. They
looked as if they were swarming with sea horses, about which I
had dreamed the night before.


That evening, trying to go to sleep, I realized I had been
feeling very sorry for myself all day. I had spent most of the
hours telling myself how very alone I was--my father did not
love me, not out of choice but because he did not know how to
love; my husband was no husband at all, he wouldn't even
telephone me; and now my psychiatrist wouldn't even trust me
to walk to his office alone. I could not stand my horrible self, nor
could anyone else. The simple, sad fact was that no one liked
Laura. I was husbandless, fatherless and doctorless. The fates
were laughing, loudly, proclaiming to the world at large, anyone
who cared to listen, that money wasn't everything, money
couldn't buy a decent father or a sympathetic husband or even a
kind doctor.


Staring out into the darkness of night, not even rays of the
moon to brighten up the black campus of the cuckoos, I suddenly
felt an overwhelming urge to thrust my arm through the

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But now I could not carry through on it. What was stopping
me? Something strange blocked the urge.


I sat up in bed. I must find out what was happening to prevent
my trying to destroy myself. My thoughts all ran together,
racing with such rapidity that I could not sort them.


Out of the confusion, though, whirled a central idea. I had
wished to sever my wrist on a broken pane. That would certainly
be an attempt at suicide, marked down on the books as
such at Lanier. But I had not made a move toward the glass.


I was furious, as furious as I had been the times before, but
this time at Dr. Anders, not my parents or Niles. I felt rejected
by them all but particularly now by my psychiatrist. If I committed
suicide, he would be hauled up on the carpet, his reputation
would be damaged, since he was responsible for my welfare.
In other words, I would, although dead, be getting revenge
(a queer kind of revenge, it occurred to me, in that I would not
be around to exult in it) for feeling he had neglected me.


I forgot all desire to harm myself, proud in this clearer awareness.
I couldn't wait to inform Dr. Anders of this new insight,
one I reached as I struggled with a wish to kill myself. I rehearsed
a dozen times exactly how I would tell him about it in
the morning.


As soon as I was seated in his office, my tale of what I thought
a glorious victory over self came tumbling out. I tried to sound
blasé but I knew my enthusiasm was showing because my discovery
was so very important to me. I had a feeling it meant I
would never again try to kill myself.


When I finished describing how I decided not to thrust my
fist through the pane and explanation of my change of mind,
Dr. Anders sat back and lit the ever-present pipe.


I had expected at least a word of praise for my psychic valor
and his nonchalance annoyed me. Wasn't my very life more
important than an old smoke?

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Do you still feel like committing suicide?" he asked.


"Of course not!" I was indignant. He had missed the whole
point. "If I did, do you think I would be telling you all this?
The only reason I mentioned last night was because I felt it was
a big accomplishment and I was proud of it. Thanks a lot for the
recognition!"


"Why must you always be so sarcastic?" I thought I almost
heard a sigh in his voice.


"I'll try to stop." I used my best voice of appeasement. "I'll
make it my next big campaign. No More Sarcasm, Laura
Rhodes Promises Psychiatrist."


Dr. Anders laughed. It came as a surprise. He rarely smiled,
let alone laughed out loud. I thought psychiatrists were taught
not to respond in any way to patients. I was very pleased to
know he was this human and that I could move him to laughter.
It gave me a kind of quiet power.


"Mrs. Rhodes, why do you think your decision last night was
different from the other times?"


I had the answer ready, having spent half the night figuring it
out. "First, I have to tell you about those other times, Dr. Anders."


"I've been waiting to hear," he said quietly.


"The first time happened just after I broke my engagement
to Niles, before I decided I really did want to marry him. He
was a senior in medical school and had just returned from a trip
to Europe. I felt he was now not quite sure he wanted to marry
me. I suspected he might have met a rich countess on the Riviera
whom he preferred, although he mentioned no other
woman."


I described how Niles occasionally called me from the hospital
where he was working as a surgical clerk, to chat about his
duties, to talk of what was happening among our friends and
to ask for a date every so often. I was attending postgraduate
school, living at home.


One evening when my parents had gone to a concert, leaving

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I'll call later," I offered.


"If you want--but I may be just as busy then."


When I telephoned in two hours he said, "This is a bad time.
I'm still very busy."


We had a cursory conversation and exchanged cool good
nights. I felt he had not wanted to waste even a second speaking
to me, that he cut me short. "Calling Dr. Rhodes! Calling Dr.
Rhodes--"


It was then about ten. I decided to go to sleep, undressed,
threw myself angrily onto my canopy bed, but could only toss
one way, then another, a thousand times or so, feeling unwanted
by everybody and hating my stupid self.


Suddenly I remembered the sleeping pills in the medicine
chest. Why not? One or two could do no harm. They slipped
down effortlessly with water. I again hurled myself at the bed.
And again tossed aimlessly. After fifteen minutes or so, I stood
in front of the medicine cabinet once more. Another few Seconals.


Still sleep would not come. Now my mind became a blur of
activity. I had taken five or six sleeping pills. Would they kill
me? Who would care? Maybe I would go to sleep and never
waken. With numbed fingers, I snatched the bottle out of the
medicine cabinet and swallowed five more pills.


Back in bed, I panicked. I had gulped down ten or more
(who counts, at a time like this?) Seconals. What a crazy thing
to do. Maybe they <i>could</i> kill me. I did not want to die, just to
sleep. Perhaps I would be knocked out when my parents came
home and they would think I was sleeping when I really lay
dying. What could I do? I was terrified. I thought of my aunt
who was a doctor. Frantically, I dialed her number.


It was not very late so I did not feel too guilty. I prayed she
was home. When I heard her familiar voice, I said groggily, "I

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I'll be right over." Her voice sounded professional. "Don't
do a thing."


The only thing I did was fall asleep. I was out cold when she
arrived. I remember nothing until I woke up on a chair in
Mother's kitchen, white walls glaring at me. I was gagging from
a hose stuffed up my nose and into my throat. My aunt was
saying, "It's all right. This is what she wants."


I thought she was referring to attention, even at the price of a
tube shoved unceremoniously down my constricted throat. They
walked me up and down, back and forth, monotonously. I could
not keep awake. They dragged, slapped, shook me. They forced
me to drink mustard and water. I vomited, the stuff pouring out
of my burning mouth and nose. Then at last they let me sleep.


I did not call Niles the next day but waited, hoping he would
get in touch with me. Four days went by before he telephoned.
Someone had told him what I had done, probably my mother.


"Laura, if you ever try that again, I'll stop seeing you," he
threatened. His reaction shocked me. My parents had been
frightened, hovering, solicitous. I expected sympathy from
Niles. But he treated me as if I were a naughty child. If I had
been a patient, I thought, I would have received far more care
and attention from him. But I was only the woman he supposedly
loved.


Soon after this saga of the Seconals, I moved away from home
and rented my own apartment, thinking it was about time I
tried to make a go of it alone. I furnished the two rooms with
financial and decorative assistance from Mother. The furniture
was Danish modern, oiled walnut, and I thought it rather
striking but cold and stark. I practically lived in the bathroom,
the only room that did not resemble the interior of the Museum
of Modern Art.


The soothing, comforting feeling I had sitting in a tub of
warm water seemed the antithesis of my spare, icy apartment.

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Or perhaps it was that I missed my room at home, my mammoth
bedroom lined on one wall with built-in closets and
drawers. It had been the master bedroom with bathroom attached,
which Mother generously gave to me. The other three
walls were papered in avocado grass cloth, and soft green full-length
drapes hung on each side of the long windows that
looked out the front of the house. A chaise longue in one corner
was upholstered in the same green as the draperies.


The bed was a big double monster with a canopy top and
covered by a George Washington spread, the one thing in the
room I had picked out myself. Two dark mahogany tables sat on
either side of the bed. On the wall hung pictures of relatives,
including one of Grandmother, my mother's mother, and my
practical joker of an uncle. A number of books were stuffed in a
small bookcase although I don't recall any special favorites such
as most girls have. I wasn't particularly fascinated by Louisa
May Alcott or Johanna Spyri. My life centered about my fantasies
and the stable downtown where my horse, Red, was housed.
The horse was not part of home since neither of my parents
cared enough about horses either to bet on them or build a
stable so I could have one as a pet.


It was in my new apartment that Niles and I became engaged
a second time, this time for good, on Christmas Eve, of all
dramatic hours.


He had driven to the university where I was taking postgraduate
work, for the annual musicale--a combined concert of
orchestra, glee club and choral group. A Bach cantata was being
performed and I sang the lyric soprano lead. Mother, who was a
professional singer, insisted I had quite a voice and wanted me
to follow in her footsteps, but I never seriously took her suggestion,
preferring by far to be a bacteriologist.

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The huge hall was crowded but it was Niles to whom I sang.
Afterwards, we drove back to my apartment as I unwound,
getting rid of performance jitters. I unlocked the apartment
door and hung up our coats (my monster of an air conditioner
was no menace this time of year). We sat in the living room and
looked at one another without saying a word.


Then I stood up. "I'll get us a drink," I offered.


Niles grabbed my arm. "Laura, I have something for you."


"Oh? What?" I hoped I sounded surprised, although I had a
good idea what it was. I felt idiotic, trying to pretend he was
Santa Claus.


He pulled a small box out of his coat pocket. I was struck by a
swift, inexplicable urge to strike it out of his hand. But instead,
I accepted it with a smile as he handed it to me, and opened it.


On a white satin cushion sparkled my engagement ring. I had
been afraid if Niles did buy me a diamond it would be some
rocklike affair he could ill afford and which Mother would say
was in bad taste but what did I expect from Niles? This stone,
however, was lovely, small but perfectly cut, held by a band of
white gold. I slid it onto my finger and studied it. I was stalling
for time, trying to think of something to say besides "thank you
very much."


Finally, unable to dream up an inspired response, I simply
turned to Niles and kissed him as passionately as I could. I felt
terribly inept. I didn't throb with the deep, ecstatic feeling
about him I felt should be overwhelming me. Looking back, I
realize I was too frightened at the thought of marriage, too
afraid I would make a total disaster of it, knowing in the deepest
part of me I was completely unprepared for it. I was not
always as dumb as I seemed to be by my acts. It was just that,
once started, I could not stop.


When I was making love to Niles, and he to me, it was like
watching a hackneyed grade C movie. It didn't seem to be real. I
was like my father who, if there flashed on a movie screen the
mere hint of affection between two characters, turned his head
away and made derogatory remarks. Or if a man and woman

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Hardly an atmosphere in which I could cultivate a passionate
soul," I remarked to Dr. Anders. "I grew up with more
ardor for a tasty hot dog and half a sour pickle than for a man."


"How did your parents receive the news of your renewed
engagement?" he asked.


"I telephoned them right away and told them about the
beautiful ring. They sounded like I felt inside, a bit resigned
but trying to feign excitement. I knew Mother still thought
Niles too young for me, too gauche and too opinionated. My
father also spoke with contempt of Niles' immaturity, but I
sensed that underneath he seemed quite fond of Niles, as he had
not been of several other young men I nearly married."


We called Niles' folks and they were as thrilled as Niles
seemed to be, and I felt happy for them. I always have liked his
mother, a sweet, sympathetic woman, and his father, a gentle
man who takes everything in stride and talks cautiously but with
self-confidence. I trusted Niles' parents intuitively.


"Well, I survived the first suicide attempt," I summed up to
Dr. Anders. "Now we go to the second."


I described the catastrophe that catapulted me into Lanier.
After our two-week honeymoon in the Caribbean, Niles left for
Chicago to serve his internship in a large hospital there. I stayed
behind in my Siberia-in-July apartment to finish the summer
session of graduate work in bacteriology.


The first two weeks of our separation, I did not miss Niles too
much. But at the end of our second week apart, I boarded a
plane for Chicago even though I was frightened to death every
second in the air. I am not one of those who feel at home 20,000
feet above cities, mountains and prairies, not to mention rivers,
lakes and oceans.


Once in Chicago, I found we did not have much time together

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The fourth week of summer school, I began feeling queasy in
the stomach from early morning until late at night. The hum of
the air conditioner drove me wild. Classes became a chore as I
sat with my hand pressed against my mouth, fearful I would
throw up. I had a suspicion I might be pregnant.


I flew west to see Niles again. My world was now changed, it
had lost its gaiety and excitement. Gloom hung over my every
move. I sat alone in Niles' room much of the time when he was
working on the wards.


His quarters on the fifth floor boasted a small balcony overlooking
a cobblestone court. I thought of hurling myself into the
court below. It did not seem a shocking idea or a terribly unreasonable
act. I just wanted to escape a depression that was slowly
eating me alive. For a suspenseful second, I leaned over the
balcony rail. The ground seemed ten miles away and I felt
dizzy. I turned and went back into the small room, back to the
gloom.


When I returned to the university, I visited the infirmary and
asked for the name of a reputable obstetrician. Three were
suggested and I made an immediate appointment with one.
During the drive to his office, I felt as if I were not real, as
though the passing street scenes were taking place on film. The
doctor examined me, then said, "There's nothing wrong with
you, Mrs. Rhodes, but a touch of pregnancy." He shook hands
and said he was sure I would make a good patient and mother.
Good patient, yes, I thought to myself, I have always been a
good patient. Good mother, I wouldn't know.


The drive home was a repetition of the trip to his office except

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Don't cry, Laura," he consoled me. "This is not on your
shoulders alone."


From that hour until Niles drove east to take me back with
him at the end of the summer, the days flowed together in a
stream of heat and nausea. My parents visited me often, worried
about my health and their unborn grandchild, their first, and, if
I had my way, their last. Nothing could lift the pall which had
descended, I felt, like a final curtain on my life.


Niles and I drove to Chicago in one day. The trip took thirteen
hours and I was near exhaustion by the time we reached
the city limits. We pulled into a motel for the night rather than
tackling, at such a late hour, the apartment Niles had rented. I
fell into a warm bath, then dropped on the bed soaking wet, no
strength left even to dry myself. Niles toweled the water off me.


In the morning we drove to our first home, high in the sky on
the seventeenth floor of a complex of boxlike buildings along
the lake shore of Chicago. Each rose nineteen stories of steel and
glass. They were not ugly buildings, but cold. The rooms were
perfectly square with wide expanses of uninterrupted glass
shaded by metallic Venetian blinds.


Our apartment consisted of bedroom, living room, kitchen
and bath. Living room and bedroom faced the adjacent glass
building. Looking far to the right, you could see Lake Michigan,
its waves rising high when blown by a fierce wind. Bathroom
and kitchen were inside, windowless rooms. My furniture
had been shipped to Chicago and when the dark walnut pieces
were all in place, the two apartments did not look radically
different, though mine had been far more expensive.


Some of Niles' friends came over to help us move in. They
kidded us about becoming parents so soon after marrying. I felt
this was salt poured into my gaping wound. I was sure they were
laughing at me for having been so stupid as to get pregnant--a

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I decided to try to find work for as long as possible and to
forget the pregnancy as much as I could. But when I went to
look for a job, employers couldn't forget it and, staring at me
dubiously, said my qualifications were good but it wasn't worth
their while to hire me for so short a time.


Then began the long wait. Each morning I awoke to find my
swollen belly bigger, the stretch marks uglier. I felt lonelier
than ever, for Niles had to stay at the hospital every other night.
The evenings he came home we bickered over small things, such
as what television program to watch (I liked murders, he preferred
Westerns), where to go on his night off (he liked wandering
drives in the car while I preferred a movie), or some
remark Mother or Father made in a letter from home which he
took as an insult, particularly when they offered money to help
us out. The nights Niles worked, I swallowed sleeping pills or
drank to get to sleep.


One night when he was scheduled to be at the hospital until
dawn, I could not get to sleep even after two pills. I staggered to
the medicine chest and doled out four more and also swallowed
some cough medicine containing codeine. I washed the whole
thing down with a glass of gin and orange juice--quite an
insomniac's cocktail.


But still I could not sleep. I went back to the bottle and
swallowed four more pills, then decided, What the hell, here I
am getting fatter and sloppier every day, an ugly misshapen
little pig, alone and deserted, no one caring how I suffer, about
to give birth to a baby, and gulped down several more pills.
Then another glass of gin and orange juice. That ought to do it,
I thought grimly.


Just before I slumped over into the fog of unconsciousness, I
managed to telephone Niles. I told him I'd taken a number of
sleeping pills.


"How many, Laura?" he asked anxiously.

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I lost count, love," I said. "'Bye," and tried to find the
cradle for the telephone receiver but it had disappeared into
nothingness.


The next thing I knew I was vomiting all over the place but
not at home, in a private room at Miles' hospital. The stomach
pump had done its work well. After a while, I lay back exhausted.
Niles was sitting beside me.


"Laura," he said sadly, "next time you feel like killing yourself
please give me more notice so I can save you some pain and
try to reach you before you take the pills."


"I didn't want to bother you," I mumbled. "You were busy.
So busy."


His face looked troubled. "I know it's a hard time, dear, but
please try to understand that I <i>have</i> to go through this grueling
work to become a doctor. It won't last forever. And I'll try to get
home as much as I can."


"Sorry to have caused you all this worry," I muttered, and sick
at heart as well as stomach, turned my face to the wall.


Over the next few weeks I called Niles whenever I felt depressed.
I would tell him I was lonely, or there was some task
around the apartment that needed his attention, or thought up
endless excuses for him to come home. He never scolded me for
telephoning but arrived as soon as he could.


One blustery day in March, I was sitting in the bedroom
shivering. The wind screamed around our building, making a
weird rattle and shaking the frames. I could see the treetops
below bending in the gale. The waves of Lake Michigan were
jumping in fury.


Suddenly I was afraid I would hurl myself from the window
ledge. I crawled under the bed to keep from jumping. When
the wind died down, I called Niles. Tears streaming down my
cheeks, I pleaded, "Niles, come home. I'm terribly frightened
all at once. I need you."


"I'll be right there, Laura," he said.


I locked myself in our windowless bathroom until I heard his
key.

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Niles was forced to spend more and more time with me. I still
could not sleep, so each evening he brought home just enough
sedation for that night. In the morning he left the medicine
cabinet empty. He was taking no more chances with pills. I was
afraid to tell him I had started to stare at the kitchen knives.


The day after April Fool's Day in 1961, Niles and I were
spending a quiet evening at home. I was now so swollen and
clumsy that I felt as awkward as an ox climbing in and out of
bed. Suddenly I was seized by a sharp pain. I told Niles. He
looked up momentarily from some giant medical treatise and
said, "Good! Time the pains. Maybe this is it."


I timed them until midnight when they were increasing at a
fast clip. We drove to the hospital. The doctor who examined
me said it would take quite a while for the baby to be born. It
did--forty-eight excruciating hours. By the second day I could
barely recall who I was. The nurses stuck needles in me to ease
the pain as Niles sat in the darkened room by my bed, barred, so
that I and other expectant mothers could not hurl ourselves to
the floor trying to end the agony.


I felt like a medieval victim tortured on the rack. I thought
my back would break with each contraction. Strangers barged in
and out, shone lights in my perspiring face, pushed at my sore,
protruding abdomen. It seemed as if I had plunged to the bottom
of a giant well and my jailers peered into the black depths
as I lay imprisoned by pain.


The baby arrived in the evening at 8:17 on April 4th. Niles
held my hand as our child was born.


"It's a girl, Laura," he said excitedly.


"Shut up." I was groggy. "I just want to sleep."


Ten days later Niles took his family home. We decided to call
the baby Kathy because I had always liked the name Katherine,
it seemed graceful and gracious, and the nickname befit a pretty
little girl.


The baby cried all night, every night. We took turns staying
up with her. On Niles' night, I stayed awake anyhow because he
never heard her once he fell asleep. We continued this as I grew

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One day I stood at the window of the living room and looked
down at the street far below. I thought that if I jumped, I
certainly would kill myself, no rescue as there had been with the
sleeping pills. Suddenly I was desperately afraid that I <i>would</i>
jump and plummet down in death. I was so weary that I had lost
all control of myself, the way you feel when you have had no
sleep at night and wander around the next day in a daze. I
wanted some peace, some rest, at any cost.


Frantic, I telephoned Niles and asked him to come home. He
said, "I can't leave now, Laura. I'm on duty."


"But I need you," I begged.


"Sorry, dear. I'll be home as soon as I can."


I was furious. How dare he forsake me at a moment I felt so
desperate? What kind of love was this? I walked into the bedroom
and stared at the crib where my daughter lay sleeping,
thinking, I never really wanted her, she was an accident that
night Niles and I were too tired to take precautions and didn't
dream just that once would produce a baby.


I hated Niles for chaining me to dirty diapers and drippy
bottles and grimy housework, all alien to my way of life. I had to
bend over backwards with Niles, compromise until the very
word "compromise" turned to "defeat." I was the one who'd
had to give up a career and settle for serfdom.


That night I lay on my half of the double bed as Niles studied
away on his half. The baby started to scream. I couldn't stand it
anymore. I began to scream myself. I screamed and screamed
and in between screams, I sobbed. I could not stop. I finally
begged Niles to hit me. He did and then I could quiet myself.
Niles called our neighbors and asked them to take the baby for
the night.


The next day, after Niles went to work and before the neighbors
had returned the baby, I packed a suitcase. I walked out of
the apartment without a backward look and hailed a taxi.


"O'Hare Airport," I said.

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Stepping into the terminal teeming with passengers, I walked
blindly to the ticket desk and asked for a seat on the next available
flight to Philadelphia. The plane was scheduled to leave in
an hour. I spent that hour, the minutes ticking away in slow
motion, sitting on a bench, staring vacantly at the board which
noted the incoming planes and their gate numbers. This time I
felt no fear of flying--I was too numb to be afraid.


Three hours later I stepped off the plane in another city, my
city. I went straight to one of the telephone booths in the airport.
I called Dr. Stewart, who I knew would help. He had been
at our wedding and seemed to like Niles very much. My family
had kept him informed of all medical news about me so he
was aware of Kathy's birth.


"He's very busy," said his nurse when I asked for him.


"He always is," I retorted. "Tell him it's Laura Rhodes and
it's an emergency."


He came right to the phone. "What's the matter, Laura?" He
sounded worried.


"I've just flown in from Chicago, I'm still at the airport, and I
would like to see you right away, Dr. Stewart." I wasted no
words.


"Can't you go home to your parents, Laura? I could see you
the first thing in the morning." His voice was harried. But I was
desperate.


"No, Dr. Stewart," I insisted. "I can't go home. If you don't
see me, I will kill myself. I almost did in Chicago. I tried once,
and was about to try a second time, so I left."


"Does Niles know where you are?"


"I didn't even tell him I was leaving. I was afraid he would
stop me."


"Let me think."


I waited. Then Dr. Stewart said, after a moment, "I'd like to
put you in the hospital for a few days until we decide what to
do. I'll need Niles' permission, as next of kin. I'll call him, tell
him where you are, and get permission."


I gave him the phone numbers of the hospital in Chicago and

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Thank you very much," I said before hanging up. "I know
this is an imposition but I trust that you know how desperate I
must be to impose on you."


"I realize that, Laura," he said gently. "And I'll do all I can to
help you."


I had one friend at least, I felt, as I taxied from the airport to
the general hospital. Dr. Stewart had never let me down. Nor
did he when I explained, after we met at the hospital, what had
happened in Chicago. I told him how depressed I felt and how
afraid that I would eventually destroy myself.


"I don't know why," I kept saying. "All I know is that I don't
want to live if life is to be like this."


He had me admitted to the hospital, reporting Niles had
given permission, and told the nurse to give me sedation so I
would sleep. Niles had been so upset at my disappearance that
he had a missing persons alarm sent out by the police.


But I could not care about anyone at that moment. Or about
time. Or about place. All I knew was that I felt safe again.


My parents visited me, wringing their hands, not knowing
what to do or say. Dr. Stewart and I had long talks trying to
decide where I should go. He asked, "How about returning to
your husband, Laura? He calls every night to find out how you
are and wants you back."


"I can't go, Dr. Stewart. I know my own lack of strength. I
couldn't face Chicago again. Not now." Perhaps not ever, I
thought.


"What about going home to your parents?"


"I can't do that, either." The time was past when I could live
in that house with those people.


"The only other alternative is going to a mental hospital,
Laura," he said thoughtfully. "Will you do that?"


"If you say so." He knew best. Doctors always did. Unless you"
were married to one.


"I suggest Lanier. It's not far from here and it's one of the

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I hope so," I said dully.


Anything, but anything, I felt, would be preferable to returning
to that trap on Lake Shore Drive. If there were a way of
fighting free of the emptiness and loneliness that engulfed me,
threatening to destroy my sanity, I was willing to try.


"And that's how I survived the second suicide attempt and
landed at Lanier," I said to Dr. Anders in mock gaiety. Then I
grew serious. "I think last night I could stop the impulse to
destroy myself because I realized I was trying to get revenge on
you, as I had been trying with Niles, for not paying enough
attention to me, for not giving in to my wishes at a moment I
felt truly desperate." I didn't want to say "for not loving me
enough," but after all what does attention imply but love?


Dr. Anders seemed plunged in deep thought. I was sure it
must be way past the end of my session. I had talked interminably.
I asked, "Isn't it time to go?"


"Oh." He brought himself back to this world and looked at
his watch dazedly, much as the March Hare must have stared at
the Dormouse's watch just before he dipped it into his cup of
tea, I thought.


"Yes," he said. "It's just about time."


As I walked to my hall, somehow I felt elated, as though one
enemy had gone down to defeat. It was only one of many and
not a very important enemy at that, but I felt a slight measure of
triumph.


DR. ROBBINS:


Here we see an important principle of psychiatry. When a
patient gets angry, the psychiatrist should not retaliate in any
way. As a matter of fact, Dr. Anders goes to Laura for a session
after her outburst, as though to console her.


Then, in the next session, he acknowledges her anger at him
and gives her time to express herself. This leads to some adequate

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Laura now begins to face the extremely important question as
to whether she can give anything of herself to Niles and Kathy.
She is also now aware that her sarcasm hides many feelings of
inferiority and inadequacy. But in spite of this growing understanding,
she still takes the wrong turn, as it were, in her reaction
to her awareness. She sees herself as a "performing seal"
and views herself in the hospital in the same role she feels she
has been playing all her life. Her reaction is one of spiteful
anger at all concerned. This leads to her plan to collect enough
sedatives with which to commit suicide.


At this point it is appropriate to give thought to her choice of
method of committing suicide by an overdose of sedatives. We
might conclude she had no other choice available, but this is not
so. In a hospital, despite precautions, there are many ways a
patient can hurt himself. Laura's particular method indicates an
underlying wish to be loved as an infant by her mother and, like
an infant after nursing at mother's breast, quietly to fall asleep.
This she acted out symbolically in the hospital as she demanded
something to swallow (the sedatives) from the nurses and then
planned to accumulate enough so she would eventually be able
to fall asleep forever.


However, it is evident Laura is not absolutely determined on
her own self-destruction because she reflects on the possibility
she might decide to live and would do well to lose some weight.
If she had seriously tried to kill herself she probably would have
succeeded the times before. It is, therefore, no surprise that she
quickly gives up the impulse to commit suicide as her anger and
hurt feelings subside.


She likes Miss Fitzgerald enough to turn the pills over to

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Shortly after this false suicidal consideration, reflecting one
evening in bed, Laura begins to feel very sorry for herself for
having been abandoned by her father, her husband, and her
doctor. It is noteworthy, in this sequence, that she makes no
reference to her mother. With these thoughts, she gets the
overwhelming urge to hurt herself by putting her arm through
the glass of the window, but something inside her restrains the
impulse. This urge to hurt herself is a combination of the desire
to force people to do something for her, the expression of anger
at them and the expiation of guilt that she somewhere feels for
her many hostile and selfish feelings.


Laura correctly gets some pleasure in having become more
consciously aware of what her feelings are all about, but an
infantile aspect still appears in that she has to run quickly to Dr.
Anders and show off. When he doesn't tell her what a good little
girl she is, she immediately gets angry again and reverts to
sarcasm. But the ice is broken by Dr. Anders' spontaneous
laughter at her ironic remark as she says, "No More Sarcasm,
Laura Rhodes Promises Psychiatrist."


Dr. Anders confirms that Laura didn't really intend to kill
herself as she goes over the details of her previous suicide attempts.
Here, again, we see Laura's pattern of making an unreasonable
demand on someone, feeling rejected and hurt, and
then wanting to both retaliate and escape. Taking the pills and
then calling her aunt to rescue her is very much like hoarding
the pills and then giving them back to Miss Fitzgerald.


Her failure ever to be happy about moving to a new apartment
is no surprise in view of the fact that the move comes not
as the mature step of a child growing up and becoming independent,
but as an effort to deal with deep-seated emotional problems.


In describing her new apartment and her old room at home,
Laura gives a little more information about her early life and

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Here we see another facet of Laura when we learn of her
interest in singing and its relationship to the fact that her
mother was a professional singer. Earlier we saw a tendency of
Laura's to identify with her father by becoming a bacteriologist.
Here we see an effort to identify with her mother by becoming
a singer. This points to one of the sources of Laura's neurosis.
She very clearly seems to be pulled in two quite distinct and
different directions, neither one of which is an expression of
herself. The stronger one seems to be identification with her
father rather than with her mother, which is unfortunate because
she is a girl.


In her description of Niles' second proposal and her reaction
to the ring, we see that Laura was not in love with Niles, that at
best her feelings toward him were mixed. She feels totally
inadequate to the situation since she is more concerned about
the size of the diamond than anything else and feels unable to
respond appropriately. Instead of feeling happy, she is confused
and frightened, and uncertain about her ability to function as a
woman. This confirms the already existing strong evidence that
Laura's illness had its roots in her life long before her marriage.


As has been pointed out, Laura seems primarily preoccupied
with herself and with what other people think of her, the term
"narcissistic" having been used in this connection. Another bit
of evidence of narcissism is her calling her parents to tell them
of her renewed engagement and talking about the beautiful
ring rather than her relationship to Niles.


It is important that this description of her engagement to
Niles occurs in the context of her telling of the first suicide
attempt which preceded her move to an apartment of her own.
One cannot help but speculate that her engagement to Niles
was another flight from herself and her parents, as also was her
flight from home to her own apartment.

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The second suicide attempt occurred when Laura discovered
she was pregnant. Her relationship to Niles as her husband had
certainly not yet had a chance to develop, and the long-existing
uncertainty about her capacity to be a wife becomes even more
intense in relation to her uncertainty about being a mother.
There are many factors that would lead to her tremendous
reaction to finding out she was pregnant. In addition to those
mentioned, Laura always acted as if she wanted to be a permanent
baby with loving parents who would take care of her, love
her and warm her whenever she wished it. When a woman has a
baby, the roles are reversed and she has to give instead of receive.
She has to meet the needs of another human being, needs
that are primary in comparison to her own.


Also, we cannot help but wonder to what extent having a
baby would further interrupt Laura's wish to please her father
by becoming a bacteriologist, a wish not necessarily set aside
when she married a young doctor. The narcissistic quality of
Laura's reaction to her pregnancy is confirmed by her disgust
at the change in the shape of her body as the pregnancy proceeded.
We recall here her early references, when she first came
to Lanier, of having a "fat, ugly body."


Finally, when things reach a point where she feels she cannot
bear it any longer, Laura resorts to her old pattern of an overdose
of sleeping pills to which she now adds gin and orange
juice. Again she follows the other aspect of this pattern, this
time calling Niles to come and rescue her. Niles responds as
adequately as he can, but this is far from enough to meet his
wife's essentially infantile needs. Her next impulse to commit
suicide forces Niles to look after her more actively, as a mother
would a sick child.


Laura's entire reaction to the experience of giving birth is
self-centered, and her pattern of feeling tortured and the victim
of other people's sadism repeats itself. Instead of feeling pleasure
when the baby is born, her reaction is, "Shut up, I just want
to sleep."


All that Laura recalls about the baby is how she cried every

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Through this act, she forces Dr. Stewart to help her escape
from the situation by having her hospitalized. It is not to be
suggested, in this connection, that Dr. Stewart's feeling that
Laura be hospitalized was inappropriate. It was quite appropriate
in view of her behavior and the considerable suicidal danger
with which she presented him. However, in view of the fact that
his suggestion that Laura go to the hospital is met with no
resistance on her part, her compliance suggests this was, in part
at least, something that would meet her needs for escape and
her wish to be taken care of.


At the end of this interview, in which Laura unburdens
herself of many memories and emotions to Dr. Anders, her
feeling of elation, rather than depression, is quite understandable.
She has gotten a great deal "off her chest," and has acknowledged
many of her own difficulties in an unhappy but straightforward
and honest fashion. This is what the psychiatrist hopes
will happen, for in this way Laura will slowly come to feel
better. This is the cartharsis that must take place in treatment.


This is just the beginning of Laura's treatment, not the end.
There is much she has to understand more than intellectually,
deep within herself. There are important changes that must
take place in the personality of this immature, unhappy girl
who cannot face frustration or disappointment, who cannot
meet the demands of mature living but must constantly react
with flight from, and fury at, those she perceives as her oppressors.
