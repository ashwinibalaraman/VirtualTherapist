Then, there is no need to speak.<br />
The <i>universe</i> shall henceforth speak for you--<br />
And witness--she who did this thing was <i>born</i><br />
To do it, claims her <i>license</i> in the work,<br />
And so with more works--

I MUST beg my readers to go back with me
to the time when I made the attempt upon my
life by taking strychnine. Since I am accused
of drawing upon the writings of Victor Hugo
for my description of the symptoms of poison;
ing by strychnine--a piece of great presumption
on my part, were it true--my traducers
deny the fact of my having taken it at all;
ascribing my positive assertions of its truth to
my love of notoriety and diseased imagination--
therein making a <i>tacit</i> acknowledgment of
my <i>insanity,</i> heretofore <i>denied;</i> since, in a diseased
mind, the imagination <i>does</i> some times
take most wonderful flights. The work referred
to of Hugo's--"A Story of a Crime"--
I have <i>yet</i> in anticipation. Neither do I need
the pen of even so ready a writer as he--unsurpassed

It has been said, too, as proof of my falsity,
that Mr. Kellem, the druggist at Vincennes,
denied selling it to me. Well, he is dead; so
I can not call him to account, and <i>make</i> him
own it. There was <i>method</i> in his denial, too,
since he was acting in direct violation of the
law in selling poison without exercising the
<i>utmost caution</i>. And he did nothing of the
sort, not so much as <i>asking my name;</i> though
he <i>did</i> refuse to sell me more than one dime's
worth, when I wished a quarter of a dollar's
worth. There is, however, a man in that town--
a grocer with whom we had dealings--who,
if ho will truthfully testify in my behalf, will
say that he bought an additional dime's worth
of it for me; and, putting that with the other,
I swallowed it all. The quantity gotten by me
seemed so small I was afraid to risk it, as I intended

I wish I had language to describe the lovely
scenes that, as visions of a dream, passed before
me. Tall waving trees! Lovely undulating
hills and valleys, covered with richest
verdure and flowers! Sweet singing birds,
and babbling, murmuring streams! And then
the scene changed, and I seemed to be in some
large building, <i>all alone</i>; and in the distance,
as though <i>also alone</i> in some immense empty
hall, came indistinctly, but <i>sweetly</i>, the sound
of <i>childish voices</i> in laughter and play. My
dream, or vision, whatever it was, was a dim
foreshadowing, or premonition, of the hospital
ward, upon which I was, in the <i>new building</i>.
And, after I had been an inmate there <i>two
years</i>--(the illusion of children's voices was complete,

Upon regaining consciousness, I heard first
the ticking of the clock; and it seemed to be
saying, in a rejoicing tone: "Comeback! Come
back!" And I remember saying to a neighbor
standing by my bedside: "What a friendly
little clock! Do you hear how it is talking to
me? The clock was a wedding present to me
from a dear friend, and I often wonder if she
ever heard of my dreadful misfortune.


I bought that poison in February of '77, and
took it April 21st of the same year. But, in
the interval, there was not a day I did not <i>attempt</i>
to take it, but was withheld from doing
so by some sort of power beyond my ken. I
seemed always to be <i>waiting</i> for some thing!
For a time! And at last the time came! I
am writing a perfectly truthful account; but
my readers must bear in mind, I was an <i>insane
woman</i>--and they may judge as they see proper
of my moral responsibility in the following
history.


I was alone that night with my three little

Now, <i>why</i> did I not die? And does that
