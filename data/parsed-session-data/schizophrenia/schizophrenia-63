<b>Getting Back on the Horse</b>


We thought we had it licked that year, 1994. Charleys postdepression
recovery during the rest of 1993 had seemed complete, as much rebirth as
convalescence. He continued to see both his therapeutic parents, Dr. Blum and
Dr. Gray, and took his lithium as prescribed, 900 mg per day. He was doing so
well that I became only mildly hysterical when, in late spring of 1993, he told
me he wanted to go back to Reed, and that both Mom and Dr. Blum thought
it was a good idea.


I thought it was a terrible idea. I didn't like the prospect of his being eleven
hundred miles away, for one thing. For another, I still didn't think it made
financial sense. One of the causes of Charley's first breakdown at Yosemite had
been guilt over the financial stress that paying for Reed had put on Lin (and
indirectly on me). Although he would be getting financial aid from Reed,
the out-of-pocket tuition was still high, creating internal pressure to perform,
and Charley didn't need more pressure. Finish college, sure. But why Reed?

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But it wouldn't be the same thing, Charley said. He had to get back on the
horse that had thrown him. So he, Lin and I met with Dr. Blum. Lin and I even
met with her a time or two without Charley, ex-couples therapy, to see why we
kept clashing, particularly over Reed. I convinced no one. Lin said she would pay
the tuition not covered by financial aid, which meant I had no real veto power.


Reed also was leery. The school dean was prepared to take him back--
Charley had a way of worming his way into your heart, he would say later--
but made him sign a contract. Charley agreed to take lithium according to Dr.
Gray's instructions and get a blood test every month to verify compliance. If
he started acting strange at any time between regular tests, the school could
demand a blood test on the spot. He also had to see a school counselor every
week. No more "confidentiality" constraints, either:The school had permission
to contact Lin and me if Charley began to show "unusual behavior." His refusal
to comply with any of these conditions would be grounds for dismissal. All in
all, a pretty tight leash--a tighter one, I realized, than Lin or I could keep him
on if he stayed in L.A. against his will. At least back at Reed he would have no
excuses; it was where he wanted to be. So what the hell, I thought, let's give it
a try. Maybe he did need to get back on the horse. The kid had guts. He'd tried
Reed twice before. Maybe the third time would be the charm. In the end, not
wanting to be the perennial Dr. No, I gave in.


Once I decided to support the decision, I did it wholeheartedly. I didn't crab
or cavil or sabotage. "Dad says I'm much more mature this summer than last,"
Charley wrote in his journal two days before flying to Portland in August,
adding, "It's hard for me to tell. I pray this year at school will go smoothly and
successfully. I feel so much better, immeasurably better than I did in February.
It's amazing what six months, not a lot of time, can do for one's health. 180Â°.
I thank God for the recovery I've made."


A few pages earlier (July 21) Charley had written the following poem, called
"Mortification":
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Were Time not so finite<br />
The hand of Fate not so strong</i>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
<i>I might erase all contrite<br />
Recollections like a song</i>.
</blockquote>

<i>Were Time not so finite<br />
The hand of Fate not so strong</i>



[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Like a jarring song unwanted<br />
On memory's cassette<br />
It plays itself undaunted<br />
With the rhythm of regret</i>.


<i>So Muse, take or borrow, my<br />
Repentance and my weeping<br />
I ask surcease of sorrow<br />
And leave them in your keeping</i>.


<i>"What is done cannot be undone"<br />
Once a wise woman stated<br />
The forgiveness has begun<br />
If contrition is abated</i>.


The prospects looked good. Charley's situation as he went back to Reed was
as promising as one could ask for under the circumstances (always that qualifier).
His "affliction," awful as it was, appeared to be treatable. He would be at
the place he wanted most to be, highly motivated to keep to his treatment regimen,
which included the relatively benign lithium, not the hated Navane or
other antipsychotics. He would be surrounded by a support network of people
who cared about him.


What could go wrong?


For months, nothing. In midautumn, things were looking so good that I
decided to visit him. This was a stretch for me. After two numbing bus trips to
and from Portland the previous year and a trip to the deserted, frozen campus
the past January (during winter break) to pack up Charley's room, I had sworn
never to let my gaze fall on the city or on Reed again. But now, at the beginning
of November, delighted that Charley was well and wanting to show my
support, I flew up for the school's annual parents' weekend. We attended parent-kid
events and wine-and-cheese receptions and bagel-and-croissant breakfasts
where I talked to Charley's counselor and a number of his teachers and the
school president. I met a number of his friends, visited his new dorm, and sat

<i>M. Butterfly</i>


Shizuko, or "Juko," was just a name to me while Charley was alive, at most
a slightly exotic female voice on my phone when she called asking for him.
He had mentioned her to me a number of times with a kind of uncharacteristic
reverence, and I had the impression she had played a different role in his
life than most of his other girlfriends, who, once they were gone (like
Stephanie) were really gone, cast off into the netherworld of disillusion and
betrayal, or else remained just beyond his inner horizon, only their auras still
visible, like suns already set. From the way Charley talked, Shizuko seemed to
fit into neither category, neither Hadean shade nor afterglow. For a time I
wasn't even sure they had been a couple.


It was not until I actually met Shizuko in March 1998, about a year and a
half after Charley's death, that my scattered impressions began to come
together. She had long since finished Reed and was back home in Japan, occasionally
in touch with Lin by letter or phone. One day she called Lin from
Boston. She had been visiting friends and was stopping over in L.A. on her way
home, and she wanted to meet "Charley's parents." Lin invited her to stay with
her for two days before continuing on to Japan, and she made arrangements to
meet Shizuko's plane when it arrived from Boston. I got a slight preview of
what "Juko" was like when Lin told me about the phone conversation arranging
the pickup. The two had never met and neither knew what the other
looked like. "How will I know you?" Lin asked.


"Well, I'm Japanese," Shizuko replied.


So I was prepared for the wit. But I wasn't prepared for the beauty, for the
slim, willowy figure that floated into my apartment, accompanied by Lin, the
first evening of her stay. She was twenty-six (a year older than Charley would

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Lin introduced us, I told her I was glad to meet her finally, after all
this time, and was slightly embarrassed when she told me that actually we had
met once before, under a ficus tree near the Reed library four and a half years
ago, during my parents' weekend visit to see Charley. I could feel myself blushing
as I apologized for not remembering (how could I have not remembered
this beautiful creature? I really <i>was</i> getting old!), saying that I had met a lot of
people that weekend and didn't know at the time that she and Charley had a
special relationship. She laughed--it was her turn to blush--and said that at
that time, early in the school year, their relationship wasn't yet that special.


They had formed a very close, Platonic friendship that October, she told Lin
and me over dinner, and that's how it remained for most of the year. She spent
six hours a day with Charley, who was living in a dorm, she off campus. They
would get together around four every day at the student union, where he
would play the piano while she kept him company doing her organic chemistry
homework, preparing for the medical school she was now, in 1998,
attending in Japan. It was part of a deal she had made with her parents. She had
wanted to be a painter, they wanted her to be a doctor (her father was a urologist).
They compromised. She went to art school for one year after graduating
from Reed, then transferred to medical school. Charley hadn't wanted her
to go to med school, she told Lin and me, and he couldn't understand why she
would do it just to satisfy her parents. We all chuckled as she talked about
Charley's complete inability to understand the concept, central to Japanese culture,
of duty to one's family.


We talked for several hours. The next evening Lin had a previous
engagement, and dropped Shizuko off at my apartment around six. We spent

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Juko's role as the eldest sibling and, for the past several years, essentially her
mother's mother and the head of household may partially explain her and
Charleys attraction. Several of Charley's girlfriends or "muses" had come from
backgrounds where mental illness and caretaking were familiar. Aside from
Shizuko herself, another girlfriend had a manic-depressive sister, another's
whole family was torn by severe depression and alcoholism, another had a
mother who was a therapist, and Charley may have seemed familiar territory
to these young women. Juko herself described their relationship as at least partially
her taking care of him. She had cooked, ironed his shirts (she mentioned
ironing several times), kept him company for hours every day. In some respects
their relationship sounded almost like a traditional marriage.


As we went through a large box of Charley's papers, Shizuko sorted them
into files marked "Girlfriends," "Family," "School," etc. She said she thought
one of the things that had brought her and Charley together was their common
condition of being culturally or psychologically in two places at once. She
was in a sense riven into two cultural halves: a very traditional Japanese half--
dedicating herself to family, training to be a doctor like her father, taking care
of her mother, speaking a language of indirection (there is no second person
in Japanese grammar--you talk to people in the third person); and a more individualistic
American half. She said that she had sensed a similar division in
Charley: caught uncomfortably between the physical world, in which he was
never fully at home, and an internal world, part illness, part music and poetry.


She and Lin and I had talked about some of this at dinner the night before,

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Shizuko, Lin and I compared notes. Charley had had a fascination with acting,
with role playing, with the external accoutrements of character. I thought
it was significant that his models for acting were not the internal American
"method" school of the Actors' Studio, but rather the British classical school
that stressed speech and technical training, working from the outside in. His
favorite actor was Laurence Olivier, who had reportedly said "Give me a hat
and I'll give you a character." Charley loved such props. He had an Anglophile
side, and liked to wear an old tweed golfer's cap and smoke Benson and
Hedges. He refused to wear polyester, only cotton, and hated wire clothes
hangers. He didn't like computers. His most prized possession was a 1925
Underwood typewriter, with its clackety-clack and crooked old letters. He
loved being "an entertainer," as Lin said when he was still little. He liked doing
animal imitations. Once, when he and Lin and I were driving through northern
California going to Reed, we passed a field of cattle. Charley was in the
back. Suddenly I heard a low rumble. "Moooooo ...!"


"That was great, Charley," Lin said. "Do a sheep."


"Baaaaaaaaah ... !" A horse and goat soon followed. A regular backseat
barnyard.


His love of the changeable, of metamorphosis, extended to art. His favorite
artist was Magritte, the painter of the surreal <i>trompe l'oeil</i>, the visual pun. He

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"David Bowie," I replied. I said that I thought Charley's powerful affinity for
Bowie was significant. It had gotten so I almost knew when a manic episode
was starting because Charley, who usually listened to classical music, would suddenly
start playing Bowie albums, sometimes standing up close to the stereo, as
if listening to something on the other side of the music. He told me more than
once--for example, during his Thanksgiving breakdown--that Bowie actually
spoke to him directly. It may have been Bowie's own epicene, chameleonic
character that created this affinity. Bowie was "the man who fell to Earth," Ziggy
Stardust, always metamorphosing, in flux, androgynous, wearing weird makeup,
changing his appearance and persona with each album. It was as if he was a role
model for Charley, giving him permission to be like that himself, the battle of
the sexes fought to an amicable draw Shizuko added that Charley himself talked
about how everybody wears masks, and how he had liked to put on makeup
and cross-dress. This surprised Lin and me at first; we hadn't known. But it fit
into the picture of Charley's fluidity, his "qualities of androgyny," his love of costumes
and props. It was as if he was always seeking to build an external form, a
mold into which he could pour his quicksilver self and then solidify. But solidity
was elusive. He was like mercury a metal but without metal's cohesiveness,
constantly threatening to break into shimmering drops.


Except in his music. His piano playing--the thing that "keeps me from
going crazy," he had written--gave a form and direction to his mercuriality.
When he played his favorites--Chopin, Beethoven, Schubert, Scott Joplin--
the jittery quicksilver of his nature seemed to stream out through his fingertips,
through the keys and strings and into the air, for a while leaving his inner
self relaxed.


Shizuko, herself a talented pianist, talked a lot about Charley's playing, particularly
in the Reed student union, a charmless building whose drafty, wood-floored
common room reminded me of an old summer camp. She thought
Charley played the clunky old piano in the SU rather than the better ones in
the practice rooms in Prexy, the music building, because there were other students
hanging out in the SU. Charley's playing was at least partly for them, a
way of trying to reach them in a way he couldn't reach them verbally despite

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hard as he tried, though, Juko said, Charley's efforts to break through his
isolation fell largely on deaf ears. Most of the other students <i>("overloaded with
work," "surly, unkempt in their attire")</i> weren't interested in classical music, and
even when they were, the piano in the SU was old and out of tune and didn't
sound very good even when played well. So even when Charley was himself
being sincere and expressive, it was in an arena and in a way that did not particularly
appeal to the people he wanted so much to reach. But he did try.


That was their relationship for most of the year: Juko sitting and studying,
Charley playing (often when <i>he</i> should have been studying). As spring
approached, however, things changed. Shizuko explained the change to me
somewhat sheepishly, as resulting from the coming of spring itself: the rising of
the sap, the reigniting of the torch of life by the warming sun, the burgeoning
of new green after long gray winter.


I didn't hear all of this from Shizuko herself during her two days in L.A.
Some of it came from her letters to Charley that I found among his papers after
she left, some of it came from later e-mails and conversations. Earlier in the
year, she told me, before they established their musical friendship, Charley
made some advances, trying to kiss her a couple of times, but she had a
boyfriend and rebuffed him. Charley accepted that, and their relationship
settled into its Platonic, shirt-ironing routine. Then, in early spring, that
original dynamic reemerged, but reversed. Shizuko's feelings for Charley
seemed to grow more intense. Or perhaps she had harbored them for a while
and now they finally burst out. Whatever the case, she wrote him a passionate
(undated) letter in late March or early April of 1994.


It is now the time to tell you how I feel since I am unable to deceive myself
into thinking that I only want to be friends with you. Continuous conflicts stir
my mind and throw me into confusion whenever I see you. Although I don't
want to lose the friendship we have, I am faced with the despair of not knowing
anything anymore. I thought that if I can convince you that I am just a good

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This tone continues for two pages, one of both longing and fear, fear that
her declaration will upset the precarious balance of friendship. But her feelings
are too intense to hide. "Understand that this letter comes from the bottom of
my heart," she says near the end. "I rather feel naked since I exposed my feelings
so much."


"Shizuko dear," Charley writes back,
<blockquote>
<p>
I don't know if you expected some response of some sort, oral or written or
with body language or whatever (now <i>my</i> English is faltering) so I'm giving you
a note. You know already that I'm very fond of you and that I value our friendship
a lot. So I figure why clutter it with notions of love, etc., things which are
more precarious than friendship? A while ago Cedar [a girlfriend for a brief
time] asked me what I had with you. I told her there were no sexual ties in our
relationship and that's why I valued it. She of course looked at me strangely and
made me rephrase my thoughts. You didn't want to talk about our relationship
before, so you've forced it to come to this prosaic (look it up) candor. I am
somewhat flattered by your flustered state but you need not stay in it much
longer.
</p>
<p>
This is not a blowoff letter you know. I will continue to like you as I have
before. If you want to be aloof that is your option.
</p>
<p>
In the paper I'm writing on Descartes I talk of the freedom which boundaries
allow, how enhansive they can be. You understand. Time will tell all I suppose,
so don't test him.

With the knowledge that you're going to be alright, Charley.

Shizuko's response to this non-blowoff blowoff letter was, at least on the surface,
a brave expression of acceptance and relief. No doubt we have all felt it
in similar circumstances: Well, at least <i>that's</i> over. The hot, torturing blister of
infatuation had burst--or been punctured; the self-enslaving chains of obsession
had suddenly been loosed. "How pleased and relieved I felt after I received
your letter!" she writes back. "Now things have settled, although I may not like
the outcome, I feel free again."


Why Charley's rejection? His journals and my talks with Shizuko indicated
that he was carrying a torch for someone else at the time--Cedar, possibly--

So matters stood for a time. Thus far their relationship, and this latest twist
in it, was nothing that unusual--two good people in a slightly mismatched
friendship in which one wants more, the other doesn't. Too bad, but that's life.
And if Charley and Juko's story had ended there, or if they had merely reverted
back to their former state, I would not recount it in such detail.


But they didn't.

<i>(Untitled, written by Charley in L.A., early January 1994, 3 A.M.)</i>


<i>(Charley's journal, two pages after the
Mr. Lithy poem, winter 1994)</i>


When Charley wrote the Mr. Lithy poem one sleepless night, he was staying
with me in Santa Monica on his winter break, taking his lithium without
complaint. During that month, which included the big L.A. earthquake of
January 17, 1994, he was his rational self. When he went back to Reed on the
twenty-first he seemed stable, and my journal for the entire period makes no
mention of any problems. Up to then and for some time afterward, as far as I
can determine now from various sources, Charley had been keeping to the letter
of his bargain with Reed, seeing a counselor every week, taking his lithium
and getting his blood tested for compliance every month. As of February, the
time of his first blood test after the winter break, his lithium level was 0.7, comfortably
within the therapeutic range of 0.5 to 1.5.


But in life as in nuclear weapons treaties, the devil is in the details. Details
like one's sense of self, one's autonomy, the coffee one drinks and the cigarettes
one smokes and the other substances one takes to counteract the flattening
effects of psychoactive medications. Charley's journals for the period indicate
that he was doing various things to unflatten himself. In an undated, pre-Christmas
entry he talks about trying (unsuccessfully, thank God) to get a
prescription for amphetamines from the Reed school physician. Then: "I
started doing TM again and it seems to help a great deal. It gives me truly an
advantage in life." He may also have been titrating his lithium--taking less or

<i>The January mist blends smoothly with cigarette smoke<br />
Dragging slowly I feel I've befriended death.<br />
But it's on the stale taste of life I choke.<br />
As the smell of salt tears exudes with my breath<br />
In this sour day the Earth has no charm<br />
No one clear thought that propagates hope.<br />
And each complex soul that once seemed warm</i>.


A note in the margin says "must finish." Around the same time:

Despite everything, Charley kept himself under control into spring. He came
to L.A. on a five-day visit during his March break and stayed with me; my journal
doesn't indicate any problems. He was writing film reviews for the Reed student
newspaper and mentioned a movie he had recently seen and liked a lot: <i>M.
Butterfly</i>, with Jeremy Irons, an ironic retelling of Puccini's opera, <i>Madame Butterfly</i>,
about the Japanese concubine (a male transvestite Chinese opera performer in the
film version) who, cast off by her American lover, commits suicide by hara-kiri. I
later found in his journal a draft of a letter to Irons complimenting him on his
performance and wondering--"It's a terrific longshot that you'll respond"--if
Irons might be interested in taking him on as a pupil. "I do possess some acting
potential. And I should be honoured to meet you; if not soon then perhaps by
chance some other day. Yours humbly ..." Shades of path B here, the

There is nothing more about Charley in my journal until a few days after
he got back to Reed in late March. Then came a phone call one night to talk
about a scare he had had the night before, an "intense physical reaction" while
playing Beethoven's last piano sonata, the C-minor opus 111. He had telephoned
Lin after it happened, "scared." But my journal reports that he
"sounded okay tonight. Somewhat chastened."


It should have been a warning: Being overwhelmed by Beethoven (as in the
car at Yosemite before the crash), the fear--code terms for heightened mood.
But I was taking the glass-half-full approach. My journal:
<blockquote>
<p>
Re: Being scared. There are, or can be, positive aspects to fear. Fear of what
is dangerous or threatening, fear when you're at risk, as Ch. is re: mood disorder,

Wishful thinking. The saber-toothed tiger was coiling, fangs bared. Charley's
journal entries for the period--the following are from the end of March and
mid-April--are like an encroaching low-pressure weather system, not the
storm yet, but the calm before:

As spring progressed, sometime between late April and mid-May, Charley
stopped taking his lithium. By late May, when I learned what was happening,
his blood lithium level was 0.2, below the minimum therapeutic level of 0.5.
The lowered lithium level, added to the effects of the drugs, coffee, sleeplessness,
meditation and other stimulants he had been using for months--including
crystal methamphetamines and synthetics like XTC, Shizuko told me
later--began to push him toward the edge. Shizuko thought the reason for
Charley's taking uppers and going off lithium was the pressure of schoolwork,
particularly his end-of-year papers (he was having special trouble with Milton).
Writing papers wasn't easy for Charley; he preferred playing piano. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_41321');">[note]</a><div id="_note_41321" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">4 But even the piano was not without problems. Some time in late
winter/spring--unfortunately I can't pinpoint the date--Charley got stage
fright at a Friday afternoon recital he had been preparing for, and he was
unable to perform. The experience, in the Reed chapel in front of an audience,
was mortifying. I wonder now, although I have no direct evidence,
whether the months of piano playing rather than studying might have represented
the continuation of Charley's vision of switching from Reed--
that is, path C, the somewhat boring life of the mind--to music school and
becoming a concert pianist--path B, the great artist. If this is true, the
humiliation of the stage fright could have loomed larger in what came after
than anyone suspected at the time.</div> When it
came time to do the reading and writing, Juko thought, he needed to be able
to concentrate better, to be less mentally flat. This is a common reason for
going off lithium. Both Kate Millett and Kay Jamison talk about it. It is not just
nostalgia for the highs, but also frustration over "Mr. Lithy's" dulling, slowing
effect, like weights around a runner's ankles--tolerable for practice, maybe, but
not for the actual race.


We have seen how all of Charley's breakdowns were marked at the beginning
by a romantic fixation: standing too near the girl at Yosemite, thinking the
young woman in San Francisco was "Allison," becoming obsessed with the
humanities professor at Reed. This is typical of budding mania, one of whose
symptoms is hypersexuality, the feeling of erotic omnipotence in which (as Kay
Jamison says) "the power to seduce and captivate others [is] a felt certainty." It is
possible that Charley's romantic fixations were particularly intense because of his
own sexual doubts, a form of overcompensation, of trying to win the "battle of
the sexes" which, like the romantic obsessions, also characterized his breakdowns.


Whatever the case, when one is feeling irresistible the word takes on a literal
meaning, and the notion that the object of one's longing may not share
that longing becomes unthinkable. Here we arrive at the very essence of what
mental illness, at least in its most extreme form, is all about, and why I think
Kate Millett and the other defenders of madness as a valid form of self-expression
or social criticism are in the end wrong. That essence is solipsism,

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One of the forms this egotism took in Charley in the spring of 1994 was a
change in his behavior toward Shizuko. For whatever reason--frustration over
the failure of other infatuations, simple erotic tension, or something deeper and
more indescribable--Charley, having so recently rebuffed her, decided that he
and Shizuko should become lovers after all and began, in yet another inversion
of their relationship, to pursue her again. But because this change was more of
mood than of heart, his behavior now seemed to her odd and, particularly in
light of his recent (albeit diplomatic) blowoff, insincere. And in a sense it was.
The hypersexuality of growing mania is characterized by conquest and
manipulation, not sympathy and affection, and being pursued in this suddenly
avid but strangely unloving way by someone who had recently rejected her felt
artificial to Shizuko, artificial and hurtful. Doubly hurtful, because not only did
it feel impersonal, it felt almost like a parody of the passion she herself still felt.


That was how she experienced Charley's sudden pursuit of her: inexplicable,
disconcerting and insincere. Despite her doubts, however, she gave in to

<b>Three on a Honeymoon</b>


<i>"Life is what happens while you're making plans to kill yourself,"</i> I wrote in my
journal on Friday morning, May 20, 1994, after the latest coffin nail arrived
from Portland.


I don't know whether I had felt more than ordinary trepidation when the
phone rang ten minutes earlier, or whether I made the trepidation up afterward.
But after ten years of having teenage kids, and almost three years after
Yosemite, I tended to feel the same way about phone calls--especially Friday
phone calls!--that football coach Woody Hayes felt about the forward pass.
"When you throw a pass," Hayes said, "only three things can happen, and two
of them are bad."


"Hi. This is Joe Jaspers, from Reed?" the voice said when I answered the
phone. "We met last fall?"


It wasn't the California Highway Patrol this time, but it wasn't good either,
I knew that right away. Joe Jaspers was Charley's school counselor, the one he
had been seeing once a week. I had met him during parents' weekend. He was
an ex-hippie, a little younger than I, decent enough, a little touchy-feely for
my taste. Charley had mentioned with a trace of condescension that Joe once
told him he'd taken 250 acid trips when he was younger, which of course
thrilled me. The perfect mentor for my kid. Still, Charley had continued to
meet with him as agreed in the Reed contract, so what did I know? Now
school was over. Charley was due to fly to L.A. the following morning for ten
days, then go back to Portland to work for the summer, subletting an apartment
near campus from a fellow student. I had spoken by phone to "the ol'
rugrat" four days before and he sounded good, a little stressed and breathless,
maybe, but happy to be through with school, triumphant at having gotten back
on the horse, finished the race, fulfilled his contract, conquered Reed College.
His only worry had been completing a paper on Milton. As far as I could
gather--or had gathered till fifteen seconds earlier--everything was fine.

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Hi, Joe. What's happening?"


"Well ..." His voice had the slightly bedside heartiness I have learned to
associate with certain kinds of psychotherapists and auto repairmen. "It seems
that Charley has had a little slip."


"What kind of a slip?" I could hear my own voice getting high and flutey.


Joe proceeded to tell me, his own voice reassuring and no-big-deal-ish, that
Charley had stopped taking his lithium a few days earlier--"apparently as kind
of a celebration of the end of school." This, along with a "small amount of
speed," had precipitated a manic episode that had included, among other
things, Charley's crawling through a bramble bush and swamp in the canyon
near his dorm. He had apparently scratched himself up rather badly and shown
up at the infirmary Thursday morning, confused, frightened and covered with
mud. "But showing up at the infirmary was a good sign," Joe assured me. "It
shows that he knew he needed help."


I asked what had happened next.


"Well, Dr. Newhall"--the school physician and somebody Charley truly
liked--"gave him some Klonopin and that seems to have brought him down
off the high. He seems a lot better this morning. He's at home, resting."


Joe had spent the previous morning after the infirmary with Charley,
bought him refills of his medication--the Klonopin and some more lithium--
taken him to breakfast and generally looked after him most of the day. I
thanked him and said I would reimburse him for the drugs and the food. Joe
said he thought that if Charley got back on the lithium regularly and kept taking
the Klonopin--a sedative that can act as an antipsychotic--he could make
a quick recovery.


Great! I was in the early, grasping-at-straws stage.The guy was a professional,
right?--a veteran of 250 acid trips. If he thought everything was going to be
fine, who was I to argue? More profuse thank-yous, wishes for a good summer,
thanks for helping Charley. Good-bye.


Hang up. I stared dully at a large painting of mine on the wall in front of
me, a ballerina I had started seven years before and worked on periodically
since. She stood tall and sturdy, perfectly balanced on her right toe, left leg
raised parallel to the floor, both arms extended, fingers arrayed like feathers
glowing in the light of a window behind her. A phoenix rising. At least that's
what I had tried for. I had painted her at another time, when my own life was

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It had been too good to be true, of course, the idea that Charley had stabilized
permanently, that after two major breakdowns and near-suicides in two
years he had bought into his recovery. The minute his contract with the school
had run out--possibly even earlier, I didn't know for sure--he'd ditched his
lithium. And so his prospective arrival the next day to visit, which I had been
looking forward to as a "hail the conquering hero" coronation, was about to
become something quite different. Even if Joe was right and he was restabilizing
quickly, what he had done--going off the lithium and taking speed, the latter a
new and potentially fatal wrinkle for someone prone to mania--was raising
issues which, fool that I was, I had convinced myself were over and done with.


But he was only twenty-one, I thought as I looked at the ballerina and
scribbled the "Life is what happens" line in my journal. A twenty-one-year-old
Anglo male, and in certain respects a young one. How could I expect him to
act like a grown-up? When I was twenty-one, I was in many ways as big a basket
case as he was, a budding alcoholic, a drunken driver, a twit. My only virtue
was that I wasn't "mentally ill," so my failings and stupidities hadn't melded
with psychotic breakdowns or led to conscious suicide attempts, although at
least a couple of times my drunken driving put me and others at risk and my
male supremacist behavior while drunk and stoned on marijuana led at least
once to groping a woman at a party (or so I was told later; I was blacked out
when I did it) in a way that would nowadays probably be prosecutable as sexual
assault, although at the time (1969) it was merely considered uncool. How, I
wondered as I sat and stared at the ballerina, not wanting to dial the phone,
could I judge him more strictly than I had been judged?


"Hullo?" He answered after the third ring, his voice druggy.


Trying to sound normal: "Hi, Charley. It's Dad. How's it going? I got a call
a little while ago from Joe Jaspers."


"Oh, yeah ..."


"Are you okay? He said you had another episode."


"Another excursion, yes."


A bad sign, the word "excursion." "Episode" was the shrink's, or the
recovered crazy person's, term for a breakdown. "Excursion"--nonmedical,

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wanted to believe Joe Jaspers, that this was just a temporary downward blip
on the generally upward line of recovery. But I had already learned that the
insanity of others, if we love them, tends to be mirrored in an insanity of our
own. Sometimes that mirroring takes the form of contagious bad mania--the
ugly buzz of negative synergy I had felt before when Charley's solipsism and
imperiousness and my frustration and sense of helplessness caused me to
become angry and cruel. But sometimes it takes the opposite form: a delusion
of normality that corresponds to the mentally ill person's denial that anything
is wrong, a denial that we desperately mimic to stave off the enveloping chaos.
And we keep pretending for as long as possible. Sometimes even longer.


When I picked him up at the airport the next day he let me know right
away how crazy he was. "Dad," he whispered to me with a tone of unalloyed
triumph, leaning over to put his mouth close to my ear as I steered Lin's car--
she was on vacation in Italy till the following Wednesday--out of the airport
tunnel into the sunlight. "I threw away the Tissot!"


The Tissot was a pricey watch Lin and I had gotten him the previous
Christmas, its face full of calendars and little dials that turned into stopwatches
or told you the time in Moscow. He had picked it out himself; he loved his
Tissot. And now he had thrown it into the swamp--along with his wallet, he
told me proudly--during his little ramble in the bramble near his dorm. I
could see the scratches on his face and arms.


I didn't bother to ask why he had thrown away the watch. Either he would
say, "Dad, you just wouldn't understand," or else it would be something about
divesting himself of the finite and transient. Throwing away watches was a
Charley favorite. The now-swamped Tissot hadn't been the first, after all. He
had tossed his watch away during his freshman-year Halloween "iawaska" seed
episode, and he had bought and then immediately given another one away to
the homeless man the weekend after Yosemite. Discarding watches had something
to do with obliterating time, which had something to do with having
god consciousness.

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Oh, great," I merely said.


I drove on, still in semishock from Joe Jaspers's call because I really hadn't
seen this one coming. What was more, it caught me at a bad time. I had quit
my job two and a half months earlier to write, living first off four thousand
dollars in accrued vacation pay and cashed-in company pension money and
lately on credit cards. Taking time off had been a luxury I had allowed myself
precisely because I'd thought Charley was okay and wouldn't be needing me.
But after a promising start my writing project had gone sour, and I had been
on the edge of a creative and personal slump even before Joe Jaspers called.


All these subjective weaknesses would for me make this new crisis the worst
so far. The hours and days that followed with Charley were like an imprisonment,
solitary confinement without solitude. It wasn't that he himself did
anything particularly awful. There were no suicide attempts, no really crazy
behavior. He was simply oblivious, unconcerned about what had just
happened--flipping out at school, ditching the lithium and the Milton paper
and the Tissot, dooming his relationship with Reed forever. His sole concern
seemed to be to get rent money from me and Lin for the apartment he had
sublet in Portland, to which he wanted to return as soon as possible. I was
reduced to support staff for his one-man show, a backstage technician at best,
an insentient prop at worst. He dealt with me when he had to, patronizingly. I
asked him whether he had a job lined up for the summer. Well no, he didn't
have one yet, but no problem--when he got back to Portland he would "formulate
resume," he wrote on a wish list presented to me toward the end of his
stay (note the correctly accented e's). I felt like the third person on a honeymoon,
some misplaced chaperone whose only function was to keep the champagne
glasses filled for the happy couple (Charley and his mania), otherwise
discreetly disappear. Normally I would have shrugged it off, but in my own
defeated mood I was needier than usual and took his condescension more personally
than I normally would.


There was also the constant underlying concern for his physical safety, the
fear that he was capable of hurting himself at any time even when he wasn't
suicidal--like the time he had started out into traffic at the Castro Street fair.
Even tennis could become a white-knuckle sport with Charley. He suggested
one day that we play, but once on the court he began doing a disappearing act
in plain view, forgetting how many games were in a set. bending down to talk

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But then he would look at me with a sweet smile--particularly after communing
with one of the sparrows flitting around the court--and I knew I
couldn't kill myself, I had to keep <i>him</i> from killing <i>hims</i>elf. He was still my kid,
and I loved him, and I was responsible. I couldn't walk off the job now.


A few days later I did, in a sense, walk off the job, or allow the job to walk
off from me. With a little help from Southwest Airlines.

Charley was adamant about going back to Portland; it was not even a matter
for discussion. Naturally, I was totally opposed as things now stood; he was

I shot off both. On May 31 we had a joint session with Dr. Gray, and
Charley agreed to go back on a small dose of Navane together with the
lithium. All the while I kept trying to talk him into staying in L.A. longer. But
June 2 came and he was insistent. Lin and I told him we still didn't want him
to go, and we thought we had him boxed in. The airline required an additional
thirty-five dollars to change his return date, and he had no money or credit
cards (they were in the wallet at the bottom of the Reed swamp along with
the Tissot). The evening of his flight he told me I should give him the thirty-five
dollars since it had been my idea to change the return date. This was of
course true, but I refused to give him the money anyway. He accused me of
going back on our deal, which was also true. He called Lin and asked her to
drive him to the airport. She refused. He asked me for money for a cab or
shuttle. I refused. He then silently packed his bags, gave me a contemptuous
glance and stalked out of the apartment toward the nearest bus stop, where for
fifty cents, which he had, he could get a Santa Monica bus to the airport.


After he was out the door I called Lin and told her what had happened and
to expect a call in a couple of hours from the airport, a final plea to give him
the thirty-five dollars followed by a demand when she said no to come and get
him. He called exactly as I'd predicted, but when Lin refused to give him the
money and asked if he wanted to be picked up he said no, he could take care
of himself. She and I then talked again, convinced he was stuck at the airport
and would call us later that night or the next morning. He might stay at the
terminal all night to scare us or save his pride, then come home.


He called the next morning--from Portland. He had talked the ticket agent
into rebooking his flight for free.


Lin and I were by now exhausted--exhausted and fed up. Fed up with
Charley, fed up with the airline, fed up with ourselves for not being tougher.

<b>"I'm Sorry to Have to Tell You This, Sir ..."</b>


The next three weeks added new meaning to the concept of <i>sturm und
drang</i>, and not just for our family. About a week after Charley went back up
north, Nicole Simpson and Ron Brown were murdered and the whole O. J.
Simpson drama erupted. My birthday came a few days later, June 15. Lin took
me, Jenny and her boyfriend Jim to dinner, and we all talked about O. J. and
tried to enjoy ourselves while silently wondering how the person not at the
table was doing. At the end of dinner Lin gave me my present, a brightly
painted wooden Oaxacan dragon, about two feet long, with a little spit of fire
coming out of its smiling mouth. "Lin and I worried about Charley," I wrote
in my journal that night. "Yesterday had thoughts seeing myself (&amp; her) almost
preparing ourselves psychologically for losing him--a kind of distancing process--
not whole story of course but there's an aspect to it--like we're trying
to buffer ourselves." Our contact with him had been minimal since his flight
back to Portland. So, it turned out, had everybody else's. Much later I pieced
together an account of what had gone on, mainly from Shizuko.


When Charley arrived back in Portland on June 3 he was at least intermittently
psychotic. He took to wearing dark glasses and seemed confused, Juko
said, often not knowing where he was. One day he got a bottle of Guinness
Stout and told her they had to do something together. He took her on the bus

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She saw him a few other times that week. They would have cappuccino at
a coffeehouse near his apartment. He cooked her dinner one evening, a dish I
taught him, caramelized broccoli and garlic sautÃ©ed in olive oil over pasta. He
was difficult to deal with, arrogant and aloof in his dark glasses, talking about
how everyone had masks. When Shizuko asked him to remove <i>his</i> mask he
became agitated, saying there was nothing behind it. On June 9 she wrote him
from Northern California, where she had gone for her sister's college graduation.
The letter is full of confusion and anguish:
<blockquote>
<p>
Dear Charley, Greetings to you from hot and sunny Santa Cruz. Thanks
again for the delicious dinner. Too bad the atmosphere got hostile toward the
end. I have all your notes and letters with me right now. I re-read them at least
twenty times. You remain dear to my heart and your letters are valuable to me.
...Why are we being so hostile to each other? I meant to tell you at Papocino's
why I did not return your phone calls. Perhaps you might rip this letter into
pieces but I will say why this time.
</p>
<p>
The night you came to my house and had Chinese rice and tea, you left me
to go to Safeway at the empty SU. I felt so used and disposed. This is why I
didn't return your phone calls. This is also the reason why I was annoyed when
you took the cigarettes from me. It was not the fact that you took the cigarettes,
but the way you took them. I'm sure you know what I am talking about. You've
caused me to feel petty and used, in the same way that I felt when I was left in
the SU. I couldn't speak this discomfort to you for the fear of upsetting you.
But, you are puzzled, so this is an answer. I am not going to be passive this time.
At one point when you were away to L.A. I thought of not being friends anymore.
But, I read a passage in one of your notes which said, "Without music life
would be a mistake." I agree. You are dear to me. Sometimes you make me feel
so intimidated because of my horrible English. Thanks to you, my vocab.
increased (I am not being cynical). I love your metaphorical ideas and projects.
The way you are sensitive to light, smell, taste, and noise makes me aware of different
perspectives. I noticed the impressive glance you had when I touched
your face before I left (perhaps this is why I touched it). The way which your
eyelashes fell and the smiling edges of your mouth are aspects of yours that are

I want you to know that I am in this flustered, as you might call it, state
because I like you and I don't know what to do with these rude actions (i.e. leaving
me in the SU). Please, don't do things that you don't want other people to
do to you to me.--This is all I ask. If you are going to use me, do it wisely. Do
it in a subtle and vague manner. Don't let me know that you have used me. Please
let me know what is upsetting you. I really cannot go on like this, being confused
and disturbed.


The confusion reminds me of my own confusion after Yosemite. Shizuko
had never seen Charley psychotic before. Anything she knew of his history of
breakdowns was abstract and vague. Till now he had been a slightly off-kilter
youth who played Chopin and was too beautiful for Reed, his less desirable
qualities--a tendency to be self-centered and arrogant--smoothed out in her
view not only by her love but by her understanding: she could see his aloofness
for the shield it was. Now, suddenly, he was acting in a new way, odder and
more demanding, thoughtless and importunate, his diamond-in-the-rough,
tough-tender persona gone, only the rough and tough remaining. And when
she called him to account, hoping for some acknowledgment of her feelings
and needs, it didn't come.


At least it didn't come directly--not yet, anyway. But it would soon come
indirectly. It would come because it was both Charley's blessing and his curse that
he never remained alone at the top of the world for long, at the pole of pure ego.
His basic decency and human feelings always reemerged, but in the wake of his
manic outbursts in which he had treated others badly (or behaved "inappropriately")
these feelings often took the form of profound embarrassment and self-disgust.
The summer before, writing in his journal about his fall 1992
obsession/breakdown over the humanities professor, he had made a list of
"Associations" with her. They included "ancestral connection ... identity fulfillment ...
psychosexual dysfunction ... romance, fantasy fueled by primal urges,
maternal, nubile qualities (shudder) [the "shudder" is Charley's interpolation, not
mine--JA] ... incoherently primal forces ... <i>the fiendish influence of mania ... contrition
resurfaced ... delusional cancer ... histrionic tendencies</i>." (emphasis added)


Although I am taking some liberties in claiming that these same associations
now came into play regarding his treatment of Shizuko--especially the

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But not quite yet. For the time being there was silence. Charley didn't
answer Shizuko's letter or return her phone calls, and finally, exhausted by his
behavior and feeling her own integrity under attack, she gave up on him.
During the same period that they lost touch, the second and third week of
June, he was mostly out of touch with Lin and entirely out of touch with me.
The ten days after Shizuko's letter of June 9 are largely a void.


On June 19, Sunday, I was due at Lin's for a family evening; she had
invited Jenny, Jim and Jim's father for an early dinner and asked me to cohost.
When I got to her place around three, the first to arrive, she told me she had
been on the phone with Charley in Portland and he sounded very weird.
Apparently he had "lost" his lithium and Navane. He wanted more, but didn't
know how to get refills.


This was extremely ominous for several reasons. Normally Charley took
medication under a kind of permanent protest, going along with the program
because I (or his doctors, or the school) wanted him to, not because he believed
he needed to. For him now to be actively trying to get medication was uncharacteristic,
and it probably meant that he was very scared. The survival part of
him was sending out alarms. It also meant that he was obviously disoriented;
otherwise he would have been able to get the prescriptions refilled without us.


I dialed his number and he answered. He was so vague that it took me a
while just to figure out what his problem was getting the refills. It seemed to
involve some sort of miscommunication with his pharmacy; possibly he was
calling the wrong store entirely. I tried to help him get focused enough to find
out whether there was an open pharmacy in his neighborhood that he could
get to without a car. After a couple of calls he gave me the name of one and I
called it to make sure it would fill a prescription over the phone from an out-of-state
physician or psychiatrist (Charley had told me that his regular school
physician, who normally wrote his prescriptions, was out of town). Yes to both
questions, the pharmacist said, although they were closing early--in an hour,
since it was Sunday. Would they accept payment from me by credit card? Yes
again. I hung up and called Dr. Gray to ask him to call Portland and talk to the

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I hung up for the last time I didn't know if any of what I had done
would actually help. Even though Charley wanted the medication, he was so
confused and at times combative, at one point hanging up on me when I
started getting too pushy and parental, that I wasn't sure he was capable of getting
to the store quickly enough, or at all. It was obvious that other things--
"internal stimuli"--were vying for his attention. One time while I was talking,
trying to get him to focus, he lost touch with me completely and started mumbling
about "the serpent ..." Instead of making me more sympathetic and
determined to see him through this--clearly he was in need of immediate,
serious help--it just made me mad, although I suppressed it. <i>The serpent!</i> I
thought. <i>What next?!</i> It was like some bad teen horror movie (my Stephen
King son!). Because of this, by the time I finished giving him the information
about where to pick up the refills, my feeling was "good riddance." What more
could I do? There were people coming and I had food to prepare. It would be
rude to burden our guests with all this drama. My idiot notion of having to be
a good host even under the most dire circumstances, together with my accumulated
anger and frustration, were overcoming whatever shreds of sense I had
left. In my mind, the two tasks of restoring Charley's sanity (and perhaps saving
his life) and not overcooking the spaghetti seemed of equal weight.
Actually, the spaghetti was weightier, since it was there and Charley wasn't.


Fortunately, at this point Jenny stepped forward. When she and Jim arrived
after the flurry of phone calls, Lin and I greeted them with what we hoped was
hospitable calm, but Jenny saw right through it and asked what was going on.
I, the all-wise, all-powerful father who wanted to spare his daughter any discomfort,
assured her that everything was okay. We had been having a problem

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Jenny didn't buy it. As I marinated the salmon she took Lin aside and prodded
her for more details. As I cooked and played host to Jim and his father,
mother and daughter gulped down their food and resumed huddling in the
next room with the door closed. Like me, Lin had temporarily lapsed into the
belief that Charley was okay--hadn't the calls solved the problem?--but Jenny
the skeptic continued to work on her, questioning and prodding and demanding
that we do more to help her pain-in-the-ass but beloved "widdiw wud-duh"--
little brother. I will always treasure her for this. It could not have been
easy to breach the blank parental wall. For all our mistakes, Lin and I had for
the most part been reasonably sane parents, and it would have been easy and
natural for Jenny to let the matter drop. But she didn't. This was how the family
operated during these years of crisis. When one of us--or two--faltered,
another would pick up the banner. This time it was Jenny. By the end of dinner
she and Mom had decided that Lin would fly to Portland on the next available
flight.


The decision would end up saving Charley's life for another two and a half
years.


But it wasn't saved quite yet.


By the next day, Monday, my journal reports, everything seemed to be
working out. Lin flew to Portland in the morning and found Charley alive and
apparently well in his apartment. He hadn't known she was coming and tried
to keep her out at first, but she mothered her way in and eventually got him
to go with her to our home away from home, Motel 6. When I spoke to her
around seven in the evening she said Charley seemed okay, mentioning only in
passing that there were some blood stains in his apartment. They had come, she
thought, from a cut on his ear that he had shown her; he didn't manifest any
other signs of injury. I shrugged mentally and said it didn't sound like a big
deal, and the discussion moved on. I didn't even mention the remark about the
blood in my journal entry later that night. There were more important things
to think about--for example, should she bring him back with her to L.A. or
try to get him help up there?


The whole horrendous drug-refill experience of the day before--Charley's
helplessness, my incompetence--had roused me from my months-long

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By the next morning my restored sense of reality was taking other forms. I
decided to go back to work, and I quickly lined up a new job. If I couldn't
write, at least I could proofread; I wasn't incompetent in everything. In fact,
given the family chaos, ending my sabbatical without having written anything
worthwhile could be seen as necessary rather than an admission of defeat. In a
horrible kind of way, these family crises provided a refuge and excuse, a chance
to stop worrying about my creative failures. They certainly made the time pass.
"Almost this whole day from 1 P.M. on spent sitting/lying semicomatose from
lack of sleep last two nights and worry/anxiety," my journal reports.


They were good for my waistline, too. "Appetite zero--in weight loss mode
per first two episodes of Ch.'s psychosis. The first one I lost about ten lb. in one
week. Who needs dieting?"


By the next morning I was sure my renewed resolve had helped save the
day. Jeff had called Lin at the motel just as he said he would. "Talked to Lin 11-something
last night," my journal says Tuesday morning. "Ch. in Ryles--yay!!
We get to go to Mississippi after all--hopefully for the whole five days unless
I have to fly back to Portland in emergency. He actually was willing to go to
Ryles."


The "Mississippi" reference was to a trip Lin and I had been planning to
Jackson for the thirty-year reunion of Freedom Summer voter-registration veterans,
of whom Lin was one. She had asked me months before if I wanted to go
with her, and I had said yes. We had planned to leave L.A. early Wednesday, June
22, and come back on Sunday, but the crisis with Charley had put all those plans

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I spent Tuesday evening at my apartment packing for the trip, then went to
Lin's to sleep on her couch, which would simplify getting to the airport the next
morning. At around ten she went upstairs to a neighbor's to say she was leaving
and ask her to feed the cats. I was relaxing on the couch, thinking about going
to sleep.


The phone rang. It was Jeff from Ryles, asking for Lin.


I told him who I was and said she was out for a minute. He sounded very
subdued. He asked if we had gotten his earlier messages. I said no, Lin's answering
machine wasn't working. Was there something wrong?


He spoke haltingly. He must have picked up on my cheery tone; as far as I
knew everything was fine. He seemed disappointed that I hadn't heard whatever
message he'd left earlier that day.


"Mr. Aurthur, when Charley's labs came back we--"


"I'm sorry--what are labs'?"


"His lab tests. We take routine lab tests when patients are admitted. When
the labs came back there were some weird readings of his blood work. They
pointed toward the beginning of kidney failure. We didn't know why. So we
took your son to the emergency room at Portland Adventist and he was given
a complete physical. The doctor found two punctures in his chest that were
causing internal bleeding. So he was taken to another hospital--Providence
Hospital--where he's undergoing open-heart surgery right now." Pause. "His
chances are fair." When I didn't answer: "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, sir ..."


"Oh my God ..."

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I'm sorry to have to tell you this, sir," he repeated in a tortured voice. (It
didn't sound like he thought Charley's chances were "fair" at all.) Another few
seconds of silence. Then: "Sir?"


"...Yes ...?"


"Would you stay where you are for a few minutes while I call Providence?
I want to verify what I just told you and get any more information I can. Will
you stay there?"


"Yeah, sure ..."


"I promise I'll call you within five minutes."


He hung up. I sat staring ahead, the life seeping out of me as if there were
a puncture in <i>my</i> chest, feeling the way I had always imagined Willy Loman felt
in <i>Death of a Salesman</i>--sagging shoulders, a ruin. I felt as if I were out of my
own body, observing myself--a lifeless hulk--looking dully out the window.
Charley was dying--or already dead. Jeff had said as much. Emergency Room
Charley had hit the wall at last.


Then a thought almost as frightening. <i>How was I going to tell Lin?</i> Charley
was eleven hundred miles away but she was here, upstairs chatting with her
friend, telling her where the cat food was, as lighthearted as I had been five--
no, three--minutes before. How was I going to deal with her? I felt like a little
boy who had misbehaved and now had to tell his mother before she found out
on her own. I stood, staring, a rabbit caught in the cosmic headlight. Couldn't
I just stay like this? Maybe if I just waited here, absolutely still, something
would happen--a major earthquake, a giant asteroid striking the earth and
bringing about mass extinction. I could die out, like the dinosaurs. Anything
to avoid having to tell Charley's mother.


But no earthquake came, no asteroid. I remained standing and staring for
another minute or so, first surrendering to and then trying to shake off the overwhelming
fatigue, the sense of utter futility that had engulfed me. But nothing
was going to save me now.


Then it did.


The phone rang. Oh yes, I remembered, Jeff had said he'd call me back
within five minutes. Had it been five minutes? I had no idea. I looked at the
phone as it rang. It would be bad news, of course, I had no doubt about that.
But at that moment even bad news would keep me from having to go upstairs
for another minute or so. I picked it up and said hello.

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Hello, Mr. Aurthur?"


But it wasn't Jeff. It was a new voice.


"Yes ...?"


"This is Dr. Duane Bietz, Mr. Aurthur." A confident voice--warm, hale,
with a kind of robust calm, a midwestern farmer's voice talking about a good
crop. I'd been expecting death. This voice was life, streaming into me over the
phone. "I'm the cardiology surgeon at Providence Hospital in Portland. I
wanted to get back to you right away because the fellow from Ryles Center
just called me and told me what he'd told you, and what he said wasn't accurate.
I wanted to clear it up."


"Yes ...?"


"Mr. Aurthur, your son was brought in here a few hours ago with two punctures
in his chest. I don't think they've punctured the heart but there's been
some internal bleeding. Your son isn't really able to give us a very good account
of what happened, so I'm going to do exploratory surgery. As I said, the
chances of his having punctured the heart or the pericardium--that's the
membrane around the heart--are very remote since his other vital signs are
good."


"You mean they didn't puncture his heart?" I was two sentences behind.


"I can't be sure, that's why we're doing surgery. But I'd say the chances of
his having punctured his heart or the pericardium are extremely small, about
one in a million."


"Oh my God. You mean he's going to be okay?!"


"I'm almost positive. Listen, I need to get into surgery."


"Of course, of course ...!"


"The surgery is going to take about three hours. It's very routine. I'll call
you when it's over and I know what's going on. What time is it now, about
eleven?"


"I think so...."


"I'll call you by two."


After I hung up I continued to stand, staring, trying to absorb what I'd
heard. I felt like a man who in three minutes had been arrested, tried,
condemned to death, strapped in the chair, heard the switch starting to be
thrown, and then been reprieved by the governor's call at two seconds after
twelve. I still had to go upstairs and tell Lin, but now it would be easy. The boy

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He called back at five after two. I had spent the three hours lying awake on
the couch. Lin and I had talked. Charley's chest! <i>That's</i> where the blood had
come from, obviously, not his ear. But he hadn't said a word to her about his
chest in Portland. He'd stabbed himself in the chest--probably Sunday night
after he and I talked and tried to get his medication refills, or the day after.
Then he had walked around for one or two days and not said anything to anybody.
No wonder he'd seemed pale and a little weak and docile, Lin said, short
of breath walking up the stairs of the motel. He'd been bleeding in his chest.
Jesus Christ.


But that wasn't all, Dr. Bietz said when he called back. The surgery had been
successful, but it hadn't been routine. Not only had Charley punctured the pericardium,
he had lacerated the heart as well, not with a puncture but with a threequarter-inch
gash in the right ventricle. The one-in-a-million occurrence had
occurred, and then some; even Dr. Bietz sounded a little surprised. He said he
was glad he'd done the exploratory, overriding the ER physician at Portland
Adventist, who had wanted to observe Charley overnight before doing anything,
since the chances of the two punctures going anywhere important had seemed
so low.


I asked how Charley had survived for two days. Dr. Bietz said that the
placement of the gash had saved him; there was not a lot of pumping pressure
in the wounded ventricle, which meant that the blood had seeped rather than
gushed through the cut. In addition, the wounded tissue had apparently
flopped over on itself like the gill of a fish, partially closing the wound.


But it was still miraculous, to survive this kind of injury--and to walk
around for two days. This after surviving the car crash at Yosemite. How much
more could Charley take?


Instead of flying to Mississippi the next morning I flew to Portland--by
myself, since Lin had already gone once that week.


When I arrived at Providence Hospital's cardiac care unit in midafternoon
Charley was sitting up in a chair in his critical-care room, hooked up to every
machine known to man, sipping at a container of juice through a straw. A newfangled
self-adhesive wound dressing ran vertically from just under his throat

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I walked over to him. "Hey, what's happening, Homes?" I said as I leaned
over, fought my way gently through all the tubing, and gave him a kiss on a
slightly stubbly cheek. He smiled wanly. Even though he was sitting up he
looked very logy. He was on tons of morphine. "Hi, Dad," he said as I grasped
one of his hands. "I was going to write you about what's been going on...."


I sat with him, holding his hand, saying little. Occasionally, I would give it a
squeeze, or he would squeeze mine with his long, spidery fingers--good, strong
squeezes--or else give me a wink. He always amazed me. Sitting up in a chair
twelve hours after open-heart surgery. How could such a powerful will to live
and will to die exist in the same person? The cardio staff couldn't believe it
either; they weren't used to such vigor. Most coronary care patients were at least
fifty years older than Charley, their hearts used up. One of the nurses showed me
a Polaroid of Charley's heart taken during the operation. It lay exposed in his
chest pan, purplish red, paler than I thought a heart would be. There was a dark
red line on the lower part: the wound. The nurse said that Dr. Bietz had been
showing the photo around. Nobody had ever seen anything like it.


At four-thirty a nurse and orderly got Charley out of his chair and walked
him around, trying to make him breathe deeper, get his oxygen circulating to
clean out his lungs. He was feisty enough to get. irritated when one of the nurses
mentioned the stabbing. "Yes?? And--??" he demanded. "Like it was her fault," I
wrote that night in my journal. "What a little putz." He still seemed psychotic,
although he was so doped up it was hard to tell. Most of the time I spent with
him that afternoon we just sat quietly holding hands. I tried to get him to drink
more juice and eat something. When he periodically dozed off I came and went,
talking to the staff and wandering around. I spoke with the nephrologist about
possible kidney/liver problems caused by the several days of inadequate blood
flows, but apparently recovery was good there, too; another bullet dodged. I asked
for Dr. Bietz, but he had already left when I arrived, so I would meet him tomorrow.
I would also talk to the psychiatrist, I hoped. The nurses had told me that
nobody from the psych unit had yet appeared, which concerned me, since
Charley's mental condition was still obviously grave. After a while I got ready to
leave. When I asked a nurse where the nearest motel was--Providence was on
the other side of town from our Motel 6--she said I didn't need one. The

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After unpacking I left the hospital. It was early evening, still bright and
sunny out, only a day past the summer solstice. Before getting dinner I went
to Charley's apartment to make sure nothing was on--gas, lights--and that it
was closed up properly. Part of me dreaded doing it. I had been thinking about
the apartment on the plane, I wrote in my journal, having lurid fantasies of
blood everywhere, the place a "metaphor for my failure as parent, human
being, etc. Melodrama."


The actual experience was both less melodramatic and stranger than I had
imagined. Portland is very green, and the apartment, which was near Reed, was
in a particularly green part, an old neighborhood overhung with large old trees.
The apartment was not in a building; it was a rental unit over the garage of a
private house in an isolated little canyon off the street, reached by going down
a steep and bumpy one-lane dirt driveway so totally canopied with thick, tall
trees that it was dark even in the daytime. It was like a green birth canal, Lin
said, the feeling going down it one of depth and removal. The house and garage
at the bottom were made of rough brown wood, like some rustic hunting lodge.
The small rental unit itself was fairly ordinary. It contained much less evidence
of carnage than I'd feared, and I could see how Lin, finding Charley apparently
all right, could have believed the cut-ear story. There were a couple of fair-sized
blood stains--now dry and brown--on the living room rug and couch, not
much more. Cigarette butts littered the wooden outside stairs, which were covered
with pine needles, and I shuddered thinking of him here for two weeks by
himself, psychotic, more and more isolated, brooding on whatever he was
brooding on. (At this point I knew about nothing except the "serpent" remark.)
As I looked around, I hated myself even more for having let him come back up
here alone. If I had known what this place was like I would have done more to
stop him--tied him to a fire hydrant, anything. The idea that he had wanted to
be here alone was the most frightening thing of all.


Despite my shudderings and self-scourgings, when I got back to my little
monk's cell I slept well for the first time since Monday, when I had thought
Charley was safe at Ryles. My only concern, now that Dr. Bietz had saved him

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Even at my most patriarchal, pro-Western medicine worst, I never had
much hope for Charley's recovery through periodic hospitalizations and medication,
although I advocated both when I thought they were necessary. I
reminded myself of Margaret Thatcher, one of my least favorite people in the
world. When Thatcher became the British prime minister in the late 1970s, the
story went that whenever she proposed some particularly mean-spirited, antilabor
policy as part of her "revolution" and was criticized for it, she would
intone in her toothy, round-voweled way, "There is no-o-o-o alternative ...!"
She said this so often that reporters nicknamed her TINA--the acronym of the
endlessly repeated phrase.


Was it true? Was there really no alternative to hospitalization and medication
for Charley? I saw none, at least in the short term. What I called his illness and
what he called, at various times, his crisis or affliction, was obviously life threatening
and now, it appeared, chronic. At least two of his three suicide attempts (the
car crash and now the stabbing) had happened when he was not on medication.
He had called the antipsychotics "chemical straitjackets," which sounded rhetorical
although it was no doubt partly true. But what <i>was</i> the alternative? Real
straitjackets? Or should we just write him off and let him kill himself? Virtually
everybody Lin and I dealt with in our attempts to get him treated, from holistic
psychiatrists to humanistic therapists, told us that medication was a necessary evil.
It was not until this trip to Portland, however, almost three years after Yosemite,
that the lightbulb would go on over my head telling me what these medications,
whether necessary or not, really were. It would happen the next day.


<b>My Drug Epiphany; or, The Morphine Connection</b>


I got up early after my good night's sleep, went back to the cardiac care unit,
greeted Charley, and waited to see Dr. Bietz and the psychiatrist. The nurses
agreed with me that Charley was still psychotic. So, I asked, trying not to sound
anxious, was he back on his antipsychotic medication yet? No, they said, that
required a psychiatrist's okay, and still no psychiatrist had appeared. I continued

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Bietz soon arrived, a round-faced bear of a man who looked like his
phone voice had sounded and made me think of a Breugel peasant, earthy and
kind, with just the trace of an antic gleam in his eye. I wondered as I shook his
large paw of a hand how such a hand could perform the intricacies of surgery,
manage the tiny tools it took to rearrange the tissues of a damaged heart. We
chatted about Charley's physical condition. Dr. Bietz assured me that it was
excellent, that he would recover fully without any organ complications. I
thanked him again for saving Charley's life, not just by the surgery but by overriding
the ER doc's decision to wait till the next morning before doing anything.
Charley could have died during the night or at least suffered irreparable
kidney failure. Dr. Bietz just shrugged. "When I see two punctures like the
ones in his chest, my training tells me I want to know where they go."


What about Charley's mental condition? I asked a little cautiously, not wanting
to step on interdepartmental toes. Was it okay that he still hadn't been seen
by a psychiatrist and put back on antipsychotics?


"I've had a little difficulty dealing with the psychiatric staff on this whole
matter," Dr. Bietz said with a bit of a twinkle. "I had to do a little talking to
them to convince them to deal with the situation with the requisite seriousness."
Apparently the problem was that Dr. Roth, the psychiatrist in charge, had
been out of the office the previous day when Dr. Bietz had called the psychiatric
unit, and he hadn't shown up since. Dr. Roth, the amazing disappearing
man. I was beginning to dislike him intensely.


What a disappointment, then, when my impression upon actually meeting
him--he soon arrived in the cardio unit and, after a brisk greeting, led me into
a small conference room down the hall--was completely favorable. He was the
exact opposite of Dr. Bietz in every way, a slim, balding but still youngish man
with a salt-and-pepper goatee that made his already long and narrow face look
sharp as a pick axe. He sounded like he was from New York, like me, his manner
intense in the way New Yorkers' manners are, their mental and physical
machinery ratcheted up a notch from everybody else's.


"Were you surprised when this happened even though he'd tried suicide
before?" he asked across the conference table, and I felt ashamed. But his tone
wasn't accusing, and he nodded when I answered lamely that I hadn't thought

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I asked what would happen when Charley recovered enough from the
surgery to get out of the cardio unit. He'd go to the psychiatric ward, said Dr.
Roth, for as long as he needed.


For as long as he needed? But who would pay? I was wondering. At this
point I was thinking that, as Charley's father, I was responsible. Would I be getting
a bill in a month for--what?--fifty, sixty, seventy thousand dollars? The
heart surgery alone must have been thirty to forty. I was broke and in debt.
"But won't that be very expensive?" I said out loud.


Dr. Roth shrugged and gave a slight New York smirk. "Doesn't matter," he
said. "Look," he continued, when he saw me fidgeting nervously. "This is a
nonprofit hospital. It's tax-exempt. Taking care of patients like your son is part
of the deal."


I felt a warm flood of relief. Not only was I not expected to pay but I wasn't
even expected to feel guilty about it! If Dr. Roth didn't have any Jewish guilt,
why should I? Charley was over twenty-one, no longer my dependent. He
would be classified as indigent. Indigent, shmindigent. Who cared about labels?


Dr. Roth's dismissal of my money concerns gave me the courage to ask. "He
was taking Navane before for his psychosis," I said as diplomatically as I could.
"One of the reasons he stabbed himself was that he'd gone off his medication,
and he's been off it for probably a couple of weeks at least. I'm a little worried
about him now. Were you ... planning to put him back on the Navane?"


"Yeah, when he recovers from the surgery enough," Dr. Roth answered,
sounding totally unconcerned. He looked at me and again smiled slightly as he
saw my latest fidget. "Don't worry. He's on morphine for the pain. The morphine
is taking care of the psychosis, too. That's why morphine was originally
developed. It was the first antipsychotic."


That's when the lightbulb clicked. So that was it. I'd been dimly aware
before that antipsychotics didn't "cure" mental illness, they "treated" it. Now
for the first time I was finally seeing what that meant. Navane and all the rest--
"tranquilizers," the dictionary says--were clubs more than straitjackets.
Basically they were just heavy, brain-deadening drugs, like morphine. They
doped people up to the point where they were too zonked out to be crazy--

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The fact that even after metabolizing this knowledge--after hearing the
click of the lightbulb--I would still want Charley to take these drugs (because
they seemed to give him a fighting chance of staying alive, if you could call it
living) is testimony to the still-medieval state of psychiatry.


<b>"Some Failed Romantic Relationship"</b>


It would take me a while--years in the case of some details--to find out why
Charley had stabbed himself, although I got the gist fairly soon, not from Charley
directly but from another psychiatrist at Providence, a woman named Sandra
Fischer, who took over from Dr. Roth and treated Charley when he was transferred
from the cardio unit to the psychiatric unit. I talked to her by phone the
week after the surgery. I was back in Santa Monica. Lin and I had ended up going
to Mississippi after all. We had caught the last two days of the reunion and come
back to L.A. Monday morning, almost exactly a week after she had flown to
Portland and spirited Charley out of the blood-stained apartment. "He admitted
to some failed romantic relationship," my journal says Dr. Fischer told me, "that
lined up cosmic forces in such a way as to lead him to cut himself (Sun. night?).
When he woke up he felt differently."


At this point I knew nothing about his connection with Shizuko, so I had
no idea what the "failed romantic relationship" referred to. Charley didn't seem
to want to talk about it, and within a couple of days he got mad and stopped
talking to me for several weeks anyway. The reason was that during my phone
conversation with Dr. Fischer, which included giving her Charley's psychiatric
history, I had mentioned that a letter to him from Reed College had arrived
at my apartment and that I had opened it. I hardly ever opened Charley's mail,
but in this case, given his current condition and where the letter was from, I
had made an exception. The letter stated very diplomatically that the school
was through with Charley. This would have been apparent to any rational
person anyway, but at this point of course, Charley wasn't rational. Some part
of him still believed he could go back, and when Dr. Fischer told him about
the letter he called me from the hospital and assailed me bitterly for opening

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Did I do the wrong thing?" I asked my journal after the phone call.


I hate to see him miserable ("I want to rest now"), but it seems to me he's going
to have to be pretty miserable at some point when it sinks in about Reed, not
going back, etc.... Is it possible to help him take realistic stock of the situation
but <i>without</i> making him completely lose faith in himself? How do you help
somebody "de-grandiosize" without going to the opposite extreme of self-loathing?
I feel so sorry for him, but am unable (or was just now) to resist communicating
to him what some of what has happened has done to me and to
rake him over the coals for not taking any responsibility for his situation.


The next day he called to ask me to deposit his allowance in his checking
account. "He still seems to think he might stay in Portland," I wrote in my
journal. "Me: âYou're not staying in Port.â He: âThat's not entirely clear.â"


It was to me.


We didn't talk for two weeks. No doubt he had cast me into hell, along with
his other betrayers, and maintained an angry silence. It was a silence I decided
I could live with for a while. I checked up on him indirectly, calling Providence
every couple of days and talking to his psychiatrists. At the same time, Lin and
I tried to figure out what to do with him once he got back to L.A., and the
next half dozen pages of my journal consist of notes about different resources,
free and fee, private and public, inpatient and outpatient, ranging from the local
"county psych ward"--for us this meant Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, about
twenty miles away from where we lived--to places that were closer and we
hoped less institutional. Since Charley was no longer legally our dependent we
also started the process of getting him on Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California)
and SSI (Supplemental Security Income), which is similar to disability and
given to people who are chronically unable to work for physical or mental
health reasons. Also, again because Charley was now legally an adult, Lin began
going through the steps of becoming his conservator, a kind of legal guardian.

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Over the Fourth of July weekend he was moved from the Providence
Hospital psych ward back to Ryles. Two Fridays later, a little more than three
weeks after his surgery, Lin and I flew up to Portland to get him released and
drive him back to L.A. in a rental car loaded with as much of his stuff from the
apartment as would fit. The rest we would send UPS.


The process of closing out Portland took place over three extremely difficult
days. Lin and I were on a tight schedule when our plane landed late Friday
morning, July 15. She was an urban planning consultant working as an independent
contractor, without sick days or vacation; if she didn't work, she didn't
get paid. She had already taken a lot of time off recently because of Charley's
crisis and needed to get back to L.A. as soon as possible to deal with a growing
backlog of work. I needed to get back too; my new proofreading job was
scheduled to start on Monday. We had to get Charley out of Ryles, buy boxes
and other shipping materials, pack and clean his apartment, get everything to
the UPS office before it closed at noon Saturday, then start the twenty-something-hour
drive back to L.A. to arrive at a reasonable hour Sunday
evening. I was so preoccupied that when Lin and I picked up our rental car at
the airport I couldn't seem to open the trunk to load our bags. I kept trying
to fit the ignition key into the lock. I didn't notice that there was a second key
on the key chain.


It was going to be a long weekend.


It was still less than a month after the stabbing, and Charley was still in a
very bad way when we picked him up at Ryles, not floridly psychotic but
"unresponsive, sullen, preoccupied, uncommunicative," my journal says. Not a
word of acknowledgment to his mother for saving his life, or to us for spending
an entire day, with minimal cooperation from him, cleaning up his apartment,
which included washing the blood stains out of the rug and couch and
doing his laundry. He was back on Navane, but it didn't seem to be working.
The staff person at Ryles who released him to us strongly recommended that
we take Charley directly to the Harbor-UCLA psychiatric unit when we got
back to L.A.; he was still at risk, she thought, and needed round-the-clock
professional supervision and protection. Lin resisted the idea (as did Charley, of
course), so uncertainty and contention were piled upon the present stress of
having to do a lot in a little time. Neither Lin nor I could have gotten through
this weekend alone, but togetherness was taking its toll, too, and our never

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The endless drive back to L.A. was a mostly silent misery. Charley was so
withdrawn the entire trip (highlighted by an overnight stay in a mosquito-infested
dust trap of a motel in the alkaline midsummer hell of the Sacramento
Valley) that my heart leapt when he whispered to me at dinner back in L.A.
Sunday evening, "I'm sorry I've been such a pain in the ass." He "seemed to
show signs of life," I noted in my journal that night. Later, as he drove with me
to drop off the rental car, the same entry continued,
<blockquote>
<p>
we actually had a conversation in car--first time since--when? late May--certainly
1st on this trip, where he acted like zombie most of time. Told me he feels
that "something's been lost between us--maybe I'm just getting older." I said I
thought he was mad at me for May, opening his mail, etc.--that I'd betrayed
him. He said, "It's like you used to say: âI love you, I just can't stand you.â" Few
minutes later: [He:] "We can be intimate enemies." He said "he made some dangerous
moves 1st half of year...."
</p>

minutes later: [He:] "We can be intimate enemies." He said "he made some dangerous
moves 1st half of year...."


One can imagine what the previous three days had been like if the above
interactions constituted welcome improvements.


So what now? The immediate problem was familiar. Lin and I couldn't just
leave Charley by himself while we both worked. In fact, the problem was even
more acute now than it had been a year and a half earlier when he'd swallowed
his lithium and cut his wrists. Even then it had not been completely clear how
chronically suicidal he was. The car crash had been ambiguous, after all, and the
wrist/lithium episode could have been the proverbial cry for help. The stabbing,
however, had not been a cry for help; it showed that Charley was capable
of anything. More than that, we now knew there was no way of reading him
for suicidality. He had tried to kill himself when he was up, when he was down
and when he was in between; before he ever started taking medication, when
he was on it and when he went off it. The only times he had been safe were
when he was locked up. But St. John's was not an option; I had no insurance
anymore and Charley didn't have Medi-Cal yet. The nearest free hospital, the
county's Harbor-UCLA, twenty freeway miles south, seemed infinitely far
away and very abstract, even assuming that Lin would agree to his going. So far
she was not convinced.


There was another possibility. Before flying to Portland she and I had

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The place sounded worth investigating, so the week before Lin and I flew
to get Charley we went to TLC and talked with its admissions director, a
friendly woman named Kimberly who was about eight months pregnant. The
organization had both an inpatient and an outpatient program, she said, which
meant Charley could live there during his stay or attend day sessions and sleep
at home. Or he could do a combination, beginning as an inpatient and becoming
outpatient as he stabilized. Kimberly quoted us a price of about thirteen
thousand dollars for a two-month package, which included two weeks inpatient
and six weeks outpatient.


That was a lot of money for us. TLC didn't take Medi-Cal or SSI (neither
of which Charley had yet anyway), so if Lin and I enrolled him it would be
entirely out-of-pocket. We were both broke and in debt, mainly from kid-related
expenses, but of course there were always credit cards. Seeing that we
were both still upright after hearing the price tag, Kimberly invited us to come
back the next evening for "family night," a weekly meeting attended by clients
and their families (and prospectives like Lin and me), half group therapy, half
question-and-answer, presided over by Rob Klein, the therapist Dr. Gray liked.
We would be able to get a feel for how the place worked, Kimberly said. Why
not? Looking was free, so Lin and I decided to go.


I have very few absolute rules in life, but one of them is, Never trust anybody
over fifteen, male or female, with a ponytail. It is testimony to my
marginal mental state during this period that I almost forgot my own rule, and
it almost cost me. Charley would save <i>me</i> this time.


Rob Klein, TLC's director, baby-faced and forty-something, was impressive
in the way he presided over family night the next evening, smooth and
affable, a no-nonsense, commonsensical kind of therapist, humanistic and
empathic, full of good advice about making "I statements." His clients, mainly

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Charley saw it all right away. At noon on Monday, the day after we got back
from Portland, we dragged him to TLC for an interview with Kimberly (Rob
himself was unavailable, she told us, due to a previous appointment). Actually,
Lin dragged him. It was my first day at work, so I biked over from my office to
meet the two of them at the TLC admissions office on my lunch hour. Charley
was hostile and refused to cooperate. He had no intention of staying at this
place, he said, so why answer all these intrusive questions? Kimberly, who was
soon no doubt kicking herself mentally for not having gone on maternity leave
sooner, could see that the interview was going nowhere. I asked whether Rob
could join us. I was remembering his easy mastery on family night, and Dr.
Gray's recommendation. Maybe by some miracle Charley would like him, too.
They would bond. Kimberly was dubious. Rob was in an important meeting in
his office upstairs, she said. Still, Charley (who was edging toward the door) was
a potential paying customer, so she decided to call Rob and, after a quick conversation,
announced that he would come down and talk to Charley briefly. He
arrived soon after, looking less mellow than on family night. It must have been
a pretty important meeting upstairs.


"So, what's going on?" he asked Charley after he sat down, the world's worst
question to ask a person in mental crisis. He seemed uptight, not the lord of
the manor I'd expected.


Charley barely acknowledged him. "I refuse to be a caged bird," he said,
turned on his heels and stalked out of the room.


Rob and Lin and I looked at each other. I asked Rob what he thought. He

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Rob and I kept talking while Lin went out into the hall to look for Charley.
I asked whether TLC could handle him in this condition or whether we
should take him to Harbor-UCLA first and maybe do TLC later, when he'd
stabilized. No, Rob said, TLC could handle him. This was what the inpatient
program was designed for.


How long and how much? I asked.


"We can work something out," Rob replied.


I stared at him with a mixture of disbelief and incredulity. Did the guy think
I was going to hand over my kid <i>and</i> my credit card, blind?


How much? I asked again, and again he refused to give me a figure. We
could work something out.


At that precise instant, Lin came back into the room and said Charley had
disappeared from the building; somebody had seen him striding out, they
didn't know where. I thanked Rob Klein, said we'd be in touch and left. I never
spoke to him again.


Charley was nowhere to be found, so Lin went home and I went back to
work and we kept in phone contact for the rest of the day. She called the police
a couple of times, reporting a missing kid, but a couple of hours later he turned
up at her apartment. He had taken the bus home.


He may well have saved me thousands of dollars that afternoon. To this day
I'm not sure what would have happened if he hadn't disappeared when he did.
Even after my bullshit detector started clanging I might very well have handed
him along with a figurative blank check over to Rob Klein, so desperate was I
to do <i>something</i>. From that day forward, whenever Charley cost me money, I
always tried to factor the TLC episode into the asset side of the ledger.


I arrived home after work utterly spent, disgusted with myself and angry
at Lin for continuing to resist putting Charley away. Our relationship was
beginning to crumble under the pressure of the past month--the past three
years, really. There were reasons we weren't married anymore, and here we had

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm totally exhausted emotionally... the prospect of forcing him to be institutionalized
again, even though I know it could save his life, is so horrific... thinking
of Charley physically resisting, crying in total despair (as he has in my house
when the whole weight of his misery crushed him)--that I also hesitate....


Lin &amp; I unable to reach real agreement on where to put him--she wanting
his approval, I unable to fight both of them.... The prospect of him being permanently
deranged (even if he doesn't kill himself) looms. I was fantasizing
before about getting a powerful gun, getting in the bathtub, closing the sliding
door and, after leaving a message on Lin's machine that by the time she got this
I'd be dead, shooting myself through the heart. (This is <i>only</i> fantasy, mind you,
I'm not seriously thinking about it.... I'd never leave Lin, Charley, &amp; Jenny in
the lurch like that. Too cowardly.)


Ten minutes later Jenny called, "worried as hell," my journal says, wondering
what was going on. She was at her place and had just talked to Lin, who
had cut the conversation short because Charley "was doing something." Jenny
asked me what we intended to do. I was worried too, I said, and told her I
would call Lin and we would arrange something. It was like the infamous
Sunday "serpent" dinner all over again, Jenny again prodding us into action.


Lin called back soon afterward; she'd had it too. We would take Charley to
Harbor-UCLA. I biked to her apartment and found him lying on her couch
under a sheet, undressed. "Charley, we're going to take you to the hospital," Lin
said.


He looked up, vaguely. "Which one?"


We told him. Why that one? Because it was free, we said, we couldn't afford
anything else. His look and tone of utter hopelessness were almost too painful
to bear; I almost would have preferred him manic and combative. Almost. What
had he done to deserve this? Yes, yes, he'd screwed up, gone off his medication,
"hadn't taken responsibility" for his life. But what <i>kind</i> of a life? He was just a
kid. What kind of a hand was this to be dealt, what kind of an enemy--
shadowy, cowardly, treacherous--was this to face?


He didn't even fight as we put a few pieces of his clothing in a bag and got

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What's the problem?" the blonde nurse asked when it was our turn, and I
handed her a stapled stack of papers, Charley's medical records from
Providence and Ryles that explained his recent medical history. She started to
skim the text. Then she stopped, focusing on the second page, which contained
a diagram of Charley's chest and a description of the surgery. She looked at it
intently, then at Charley.


"You had chest surgery recently?" she asked.


"Yes."


"Is your scar giving you any problems? Is it leaking at all? Hurting?"


"A little."


She glanced at me and then back at him, still friendly but now all business.
"You come right this way with me, okay?" she said, coming out from behind
her desk and taking his arm like an older sister. She led him into an examination
room where he was looked at, then taken to psychiatric admissions on the
other side of the building. Lin and I followed and sat outside the admissions
office and waited while he was evaluated. After a while, the admitting psychiatrist,
a young Asian woman, emerged through the office door and introduced
herself. We gave her a history of Charley's illness, I doing most of the talking.
She went back inside and reemerged a few minutes later, saying they were
admitting him to the psychiatric ward, Eight West; he was already on his way
upstairs. She gave us the phone number of the 8W nurses' station. We left without
seeing him.

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Once we were outside in the warm, furry summer night air, Lin started bitterly
attacking me for being so cheerful during the interview, for talking so
easily about Charley's history of accident-proneness and other eccentricities,
for deriving such apparent enjoyment from detailing his problems and weaknesses.
"This is just great cocktail party talk for you, isn't it?"


I didn't answer--I <i>had</i> blathered a lot to the doctor inside--and neither of
us said anything for ten or fifteen minutes until the car was on the street heading
back to the freeway. Then she started in again. By now, I'd had it. "F--you,
Lin," I said. "Just f--you, okay? Yeah, I really love all this."


As I said, our relationship was showing signs of stress. The rest of the drive
home was spent in oppressive silence, occasionally broken by similar eruptions
of half-hearted bile. We were "like two over-the-hill fighters," my journal
reported the next day--I was in my Norman Mailer mode--"slugging away
with comically exaggerated roundhouse punches without any real force
behind them. As I said to her, twenty years ago I would've cared about what
she was saying."


<b>Eight West</b>


<b>Risperidone</b>: Brand name: <b><i>Risperdal</i></b>


<b>Pharmacology:</b> Antipsychotic Agent. Risperidone, a benzisoxazole derivative,
is a <b><i>novel antipsychotic drug</i></b> which binds with high affinity to the serotonin
type 2(5-HT(2)), dopamine D(2), and alpha(l)-adrenergic receptors....


<b>Indications:</b> For the management of manifestations of schizophrenia. In
controlled clinical trials, risperidone was found to improve both positive and
negative symptoms.


<b>Adverse Effects:</b> The most frequent adverse reactions observed during
clinical trials with risperidone were insomnia, agitation, extrapyramidal disorder,
anxiety, and headache.... <b><i>In some instances it has been difficult to differentiate
adverse events from symptoms of the underlying psychosis.</i></b> <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_136251');">[note]</a><div id="_note_136251" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">Ibid.</div> (emphasis

Charley had two stays in Eight West in the summer and fall of 1994. The
first lasted from July 19 to August 5, during which time, he told me a month
after he got out, the voices went away. But after being released he fell into
another serious depression and made another suicide attempt--again

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sure he was okay. Over his and Lin's objections--she had known about the
pill swallowing before I did but hadn't told me, which made <i>me</i> psychotic--I
insisted that he go back to the hospital. Who knew if he had thrown up all the
pills? At the very least he was at risk of lithium poisoning, which could ruin
his kidneys, and he'd already had so many miraculous escapes I couldn't take
chances. So back on the freeway we went, back to the Harbor-UCLA ER
where Charley's stomach was pumped and he was put on suicide watch in
restraints, then back in the psych ward after a short stay in the hospital's medical
wing, cuffed to his bed with leather straps. This time he stayed for more
than a month even though he wasn't crazy anymore, just very depressed. "That
was the worst time," that second stay at Harbor-UCLA, he wrote me later,
"when they had my left hand in restraints. I couldn't even piss right. Can you
imagine trying to pee into a cup with one hand? You can't quite get it in. What
d'you do, ask someone to come help you?"


Like San Francisco General, Charley's first "county psych ward," which was
connected with UC San Francisco medical school, Harbor-UCLA Medical
Center was a public teaching hospital. Although it was clean and professionally
run, it had none of the amenities and cachet of St. John's or especially
Providence Hospital in Portland, where Charley had been only weeks before
and of which he always spoke highly. Many of the Harbor-UCLA psychiatrists
were newly out of UCLA Medical School and relatively inexperienced. Worst
of all for Charley, the hospital didn't permit smoking. "Dad: It's either write letters
or make paper airplanes," he wrote in an undated letter during his first stay:
"I absolutely detest this institution. UCLA Harbor. I don't like harbors and I
don't like UCLA. So what? I would probably smoke if I could. Now I'm forced
to quit. Is that what this was all about? Giving up cigarettes? I pray it goes
somewhat deeper."


Nevertheless, despite the tedium of the place, or perhaps because of it,
Charley got better during each of his two stays at Harbor-UCLA, shedding his
psychosis during the first and his depression during the second, although it was
hard to know how much the hospital contributed to these recoveries and how

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The problem was, of course, that no one can (or should) stay in a psych ward
forever; such respites or "sojourns," life-preserving as they may be, are not
themselves life, and eventually become life draining. Charley was being preserved
but not replenished in these periodic warehousings. Talk therapy was
sporadic, carried on by psychiatrists and psychologists who came and went and
generally saw their role as trying to get Charley to develop "insight" into his
supposed (<i>DSM</i>-defined) chemical condition. He was like a World War I soldier,
repeatedly wounded, repeatedly sprayed with sulfa drugs and patched up
and sent back to the trenches, a little weaker each time. How long could this
go on? Harbor-UCLA was his fifth psychiatric hospital, not including Ryles.
The cycles had been going on for three years now, and Charley was showing
signs of mental and spiritual exhaustion. One who has not experienced them
can only imagine how wearing such yearly pummelings of the psyche must
have been, how the white-heat friction of mania must have worn away at his
being, especially when each extreme, hot expansion was followed by the rigid
contraction of icy depression. Even the finest metal will grow brittle when
exposed to such extremes of temperature and torsion, and like a steel bar
repeatedly bent back and forth will become soft and mealy and eventually
break. It was as if Charley's life was being used up at double or triple speed. He
seemed to feel this himself, even more than in earlier years when (as we have

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It's hard to believe I once thought I had a superiority complex. I guess being
so self-assured in the past led me to my falling. But if the confidence was with
me before it shall return. If only there was some method of proving my illness,
my jaded state, was temporary.


A gypsy palm reader told me (a couple of years ago) that I had the hands of
an old man, and that I would be in a hurry to establish my place in the universe.
I guess my curiosity for death is (or was) part of that longing. That such
a curiosity should grab someone so young seems abnormal, not to mention
unfair; that I should become so weary of the material world so soon.


But thank God for modern surgery, anesthetics, etc., that my life was saved.
However, I do not trust the antipsychotics, for fear of becoming a vegetable.


And what about the antipsychotics? What were <i>they</i> contributing to the
gradual sapping of his will? I was increasingly worried about this, especially
after the morphine discussion with Dr. Roth. During Charley's first stay at
Harbor-UCLA he was, at Dr. Gray's suggestion, taken off Navane and put on
Risperdal, an "atypical antipsychotic," one of the new miracle drugs--
Clozapine (or clozaril) is another--periodically touted as the dragon slayer,
more effective than the previous dragon slayers. But the Risperdal didn't work,
so Charley was put on the antipsychotic Haldol and eventually back on
Navane, along with Cogentin for the side effects of the antipsychotic, plus
lithium, plus an antianxiety drug for sleep. Later an antidepressant would be
added again. How many different heavy medications can one person take
without being completely thrown off balance?


My dissatisfaction with the emphasis on medication increased when Lin
lent me her copy of Peter Breggin's <i>Toxic Psychiatry</i> a few days after Charley's
second admission to Harbor-UCLA. I skimmed the book, which is a bitter
attack on psychopharmacology and mainstream psychiatry in general along the
lines of Kate Millett's <i>The Loony-Bin Trip</i>. Breggin himself is a psychiatrist, and
his attack, from the inside, is even angrier than Millett's. He takes special aim
at neuroleptics, calling them chemical straitjackets (that's where Charley had
gotten the term). I didn't agree with everything Breggin said (and still don't),
but his account of the short- and long-term dangers to the brain of

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

whether drugs actually help people understand and take better control over
their inner mental lives and their conduct, and we must ask ourselves
whether the potential <i>moral downside</i> isn't too great. Taking psychoactive
drugs on a regular basis readily becomes a symbolic gesture that interferes
with personal growth and even fosters personal failure....I don't believe that
the desire to handle life through a psychiatric drug is essentially different
from the desire to do it with alcohol, and I don't believe that physicians
should look upon it more favorably. (Peter R. Breggin, M.D., <i>Toxic Psychiatry</i>
[New York: St. Martin's Press], 1991, 182, emphasis added)


The same day, stimulated by <i>Toxic Psychiatry</i> and wondering what good the
neuroleptics really did, I sat down with my journal and tried to make a
chronology of Charley's episodes going back to Yosemite, including their durations
and the medications he had taken during each episode. After listing all
the information I could remember, I taped some sheets of paper together and
drew a time line from July 1991 to the present, September 1994. The episodes
seemed to last from two to three or three-and-a-half months regardless of what
medications Charley was taking or not taking. His recent experience at
Providence and Ryles--the fact that when Lin and I came to Portland he was
still psychotic after a month of hospitalization and daily medication--made me
think the psychotic episodes had a life of their own. The psychosis, the voices,
the mania, could be beaten into temporary submission by the drugs, as we had
seen after Yosemite when Charley had a relapse in San Francisco a few days
after he went off Navane upon leaving St. John's. But they still remained,
crouching in the shadows like a whipped but still-ravening dog determined to
eat its fill, beatings or no beatings, meds or no meds. As an example of the
opposite situation--recovery without medication--I remembered how he had
recovered from the first episode on his own while staying at Bob and
Meighen's and then at Lin's in the fall of 1991, off medication entirely.


Aside from my growing doubts about the neuroleptics, I was starting more and
more to question the nature of Charley's illness itself, whether it really was just a
chemical imbalance and whether, if brain chemistry was involved, the imbalance
was the cause or the effect. As he recovered from his latest episode, he was opening
up to me more. At the beginning of September, between his two stays in 8W,
he for the first time began describing to me what his voices were like--they were
a collection, male and female, one with an English accent, hectoring him.
Sometimes they cursed him, he said with a sheepish smile, "saying things like
âF--you.â" He "injured" himself, he said, to get the voices to stop. From my
journal:

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later he talked about feeling of unworthiness &amp; I asked him about "serpent"
remark on phone the day he stabbed himself, saying I had a feeling he hurt himself
as a way of purging himself of pestilence, possibly letting the poison out
through the wound. He said I was very perceptive, so maybe there's something
to it....


Question: Where is the point of intersection between the mental illness, giving
rise to the voices, and whatever neurotic feelings Charley has? I.e., Why are
the voices mean and abusive &amp; disruptive rather than nice &amp; helpful? Assuming
that the voices are caused by the illness, and also positing that the form the psychosis
takes is somehow related to the general mental state, what does this indicate
about Ch's psychology? How can he be helped with neuroses, self-dislike,
weak ego, etc.? Where did neurotic problems come from or, more relevantly,
how can they be mitigated? Or are the voices etc. not related to rest of his
mental state, but autonomous unto themselves?


As Charley began talking a little more--the most recent psychosis and stabbing
had been so awful, I think, that he needed to unburden himself--I began
to see that the voices and other "internal stimuli" weren't arbitrary. They had
something to do with the "failed romantic relationship" Dr. Fischer had mentioned
to me on the phone in June. Later that summer Charley used the phrase
"sleeping with the enemy" while talking about the stabbing to Dr. Gray. Then,
in a conversation with Lin and me while we were visiting him during his second
stint at Harbor-UCLA, he said that in May-June he thought he had been
a Nazi concentration camp guard in a previous life. A few evenings later, when
I visited him alone, he volunteered even more. "He remembered being âmean
to me during that time,â" my journal says, "thinking I was a Jew" A Jew? I
asked. Did it have something to do with me being cheap and pushy (the stereotypical
"Jewish father," so to speak), not wanting him to go back to Portland
and not giving him the thirty-five-dollar change fee for his ticket? I had
noticed once or twice before that Charley sometimes became anti-Semitic
when he was manic, and I wondered why. My journal reports that I asked now
whether it "had something to do with his âNazi war criminalâ self-image. He
smiled. âThis certainly is the season for psychoanalysis, isn't it?â... He says the
day he stabbed himself, he jumped off the stairs &amp; lay on the ground, naked,
praying for âGod to come &amp; take me.â"


My main reaction upon hearing this was horror at the act (and at my having
in a sense made it possible) rather than curiosity over the reasons. "The

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wondered about the "sleeping with the enemy" remark. What did it mean?
By now I had inferred from things Charley had told me that "the enemy" was
Shizuko. I decided it must have had something to do with World War II. Japan
and Germany were Axis powers. Shizuko was the enemy Charley had slept
with, their intimacy turning him into a fellow Axis-member, a Nazi, which
made him want to kill himself. Is that what the voices had been telling him?


That was as far as I got, at least then. After our few fragmented discussions
he said little more about the whole matter, and I didn't ask, not only because
I didn't want to pry but because I wasn't sure I really wanted to know. Now
we had Nazis along with serpents. My Stephen King son, indeed.


This interpretation turned out to be wrong in one important detail, which
I learned from Shizuko during her visit to Los Angeles in 1998; she had learned
it from Charley. In the days after June 9, when they parted on such bad terms
and she wrote to him expressing her hurt at his behavior, Charley retreated
into the isolation of his sublet apartment at the bottom of the green birth
canal. The voices he was hearing were angry and accusing (as he had also told
me). One of the voices was Shizuko's. He decided that he had exploited her
and because of that deserved to die--and not merely die, but die by stabbing
himself. He had gotten the idea from <i>Madame Butterfly</i> (indirectly, via the
movie <i>M. Butterfly</i>), but with one major alteration. In the Puccini opera, it was
the cast-off Asian woman who stabbed herself. In Charley's case--as in the
movie--the ending became inverted, with the male European exploiter rather
than the oppressed Asian paying for the European's behavior. That's what the
stabbing meant to him, Shizuko believed: a corrected ending of the movie and
performance (Irons's) he had admired. It was Charley's repudiation of his role
as the imperialist--"the enemy." This was, I think, the detail I had gotten
wrong in my interpretation of his "sleeping with the enemy" remark. It was
not Shizuko who was the enemy. <i>He</i> was the enemy. He had not become a
Nazi by sleeping with her. He had been one already. He had violated her trust
and their musical relationship and now had to pay the price.


I still don't know if all this is exactly right in every detail. Was the stabbing
an approximation of hara-kiri (disembowelment), or an attempt to kill "the

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During my crazed state, when I stayed at Maxim's [the sublet apartment], I
could hear you speaking to me. How can I not believe in a surreal world when
I hear voices that cannot be real? I can't understand why I have been allowed
to experience, or rather endure, the <i>strange</i> phenomena of the universe within
the psyche (if that makes any sense). It's next to impossible to verbalize the
things I've gone through. (emphasis in the original)


This is not the only time Charley voiced an inability to describe in words
at least the most extreme parts of his episodes, so it would be presumptuous of
me to try. But it seems indisputable that there was a link between his psychoses
and what was going on in his life, and that the voices and visions--Shizuko's
voice, the English voice saying "F--you," the serpent, perhaps--all evolved
out of the extreme psychic stress he was suffering owing to his manic episode
combined with his perceived betrayal of a beloved friend. There was, in other
words, both a physical aspect to the crisis (the mania potentiated by his going
off lithium and taking stimulants) and a psychological one (guilt). Both aspects
were obviously deeply intertwined, perhaps leapfrogging each other in ever-mounting
intensity, but they were not the same thing, they were not reducible
simply to a chemical imbalance. It's all brain chemistry, the post-Freudians tell
us. But if brain chemistry explains everything it explains nothing. The taste of
a carrot stick is brain chemistry, too. Why did Charley's voices badger him
about exploitation and betrayal, and not about, say, carrot sticks or brussels
sprouts?


As I tried to understand the link between psychosis and one's life circumstances,
I remembered something a college classmate of mine had said thirty
years before. I had tried LSD--which induces psychosis--a few times and
found out that she had too, so I asked her what her experience had been like.
"It's what you already have, only more so," she replied, and I had to agree. The
mental effect of LSD is to lift the haze of familiarity that normally hangs

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

June of this year turned out to be the worst month of my life (more or less)
when considering the inner turmoil I suffered I simply flipped out, and ended
up hurting myself badly. So now I'm finished with Reed and will be taking a
few months to recuperate before returning to any school.


I tend to have periods where I fall down. It's just the way I am. I didn't keep
in touch because I felt some guilt over our intimacy, but it doesn't bother me any
more. I'm going to go to sleep now. Best wishes, Charley


The periods of falling down, however, were adding bruise on top of bruise.
"Even though I'm only twenty-one and a half," he wrote Shizuko soon after
the above (in September), echoing his "hands of an old man" letter to me,
<blockquote>
<p>
I feel my life has been lived to its full extent. I'm afraid it may be boredom from
here on....
</p>
<p>
I'm resolved that life is just very hard, and that my carefree, confident attitude
in the past is what caused me to take a fall. Anyway, things can only get
better. Perhaps I can see you some time in San Francisco or even Portland. I'm
sorry I can't be there at Reed keeping you company. Think good thoughts for
me and I will be relieved from my condition.â¥ Charley

Although they continued to correspond and occasionally talk on the phone,

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perhaps the "it/them" was the serpent he was trying to expunge, in his very
heart.


Charley and Shizuko's correspondence makes it clear that their connection
was genuine. When she spoke to me years later, she could still say that in some
ways Charley had been the person closest to her in her life, and she wasn't alone
in this. Other friends of his would tell me the same thing, again and again, unsolicited,
long after such statements could be written off as consolations to a
grieving parent. Charley really had influenced them profoundly and, selfish as
he was in certain earthly ways, he was not selfish spiritually (except during the
extremities of mania), and he was able to connect with people who got to know
him in ways they considered profound. The problem, though, was that all of
them without exception--Shizuko was only the saddest case, because she cared
the most--ended up having to pull away, and he always ended up alone. Take
Brian Marsh, the friend from freshman year who had called me from New York
after Yosemite to tell me about Charley's "iawaska" episode and about how in a
school full of depressed people Charley had been the most depressed. Charley
talks about Brian in his journal at Reed in the spring of 1994, a month or so
before the stabbing. "He's so far away this year," he writes, and continues,
<blockquote>
<p>
He has become tall indeed, a real Nordic survivor, and with such sensibility. Why,
why, why should he be so estranged? As if the world were not harsh enough
without the ones we cherish being inaccessible. Perhaps that is the beauty of our
friendship. We keep our affection <i>in our spirits</i>. It may sound like bullshit <i>but it is
all I know</i>. I must leave before I come to despise myself, (emphasis added)

"I must leave," in this particular entry, merely meant leaving Portland; school
was almost out. Later it would mean leaving life. One by one, the people
Charley cared about pulled away, exhausted. In the end he, too, even more
exhausted by his own self-devouring self, would need to pull away. But how
do you pull away from yourself? And if in the end we're alone anyway, if living
"in our spirits" is <i>all we know</i>, and if those same spirits are consuming us,
why stay around to be periodically lashed and beaten by an unseen, unfair, and
merciless foe? Such steadfastness could begin to look like masochism, each
exhausted recovery an ever-diminishing return.
