______________________________________________________________________________
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: Do you mind sitting in that chair?
PATIENT: Alright.
COUNSELOR: So I can still kind of see you.
PATIENT: Did you know the TV's on?
COUNSELOR: Oh no, the TV's on? (giggles)
COUNSELOR: It's just so it's recorded, you know, because the tape is running. 
PATIENT: Oh ok. So I realize I really don't know anything about you, you know your background; have you just; I mean where did you do your undergraduate? 
COUNSELOR: I'd like to answer your question, it's just that I'm wondering what role that would play for you in your therapy.
PATIENT: I wanted to see what your qualifications. I mean....
COUNSELOR: Uh huh.... Why is that important? 
PATIENT: Because someone asked me, and I didn't know. Why should it be such a big secret? 
COUNSELOR: Oh, that makes sense. Well I did my undergraduate at uh state university of Ohio at Cleveland and I'm getting my PhD at University North Carolina. So that's why, my degrees not complete yet but I should...
PATIENT: So you skipped like the masters?
COUNSELOR: It's comes along the away. So I have my masters right now and so when I'm done with my training ill have my doctorate. 
PATIENT: So, How long is your training for? 
COUNSELOR: Um it's another year, but it's a total of 5 years.
PATIENT: (0:02:05) Because like um, you know Steve my boyfriend asked me about you.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And he said, "well you should have asked". It wasn't really important at the time, because I know how psychologists are. But then he said, "well how she's supposed to train, how does she have the experience of life to help you when she's just a student." I kind of like felt that maybe that was true.
COUNSELOR: So it sounds like you have some of those feeling too. 
PATIENT: Well he has a way of getting to me, but that is true. My other therapist Kerrie, 
COUNSELOR: Um Hmm.
PATIENT: Yeah She was like, into all this holistic stuff. That was her downside. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hmm.
PATIENT: Um, but she was older and so she was wiser. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hmm.
PATIENT: I think that wisdom is good too. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hmm. What would you think that would play into us, in term of, you know of me being able to work with you? Where role does wisdom play for you? 
PATIENT: Well, suggesting certain things that are malpractical.
COUNSELOR: Hmm. A few things that have worked for me, for example; or, is that what you would call your therapist which is, or things that have worked for them?
PATIENT: Well suggestions, because you know what, what happens is that like she's, she's wiser, she's had practice so she had a lot of patients and she knew certain things and... 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: (0:03:47) You know avenues, for example when I was considering going back to school I didn't really know right away Kelly, so she told me a resource to take a test. So I mean I would hope that it wouldn't influence... our relationship.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Well it sounds like you have some concerns. Certainly it's important to know what goes on 'cause it sounds like its important that you are doing something that you want to be doing, and that that's helpful to me- not just being forced to doing into doing therapy in a way or working with somebody without having much choice in it for yourself. Because it seems like for you choice is an important part of your experience. 
PATIENT: Well I just want to get the best treatment for myself, 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: So That's what my concern is. 
COUNSELOR: Um hm. I can understand that. So it sounds like, there's... so let me see if I'm hearing this right, So if, one of the things your concerned about is that If I don't have the same life experience because I'm not older, is that one of your concerns, that because you worked with an older therapist? 
PATIENT: Umm, yeah I guess that was a concern. (Giggles) 
COUNSELOR: You smile when you say that. 
PATIENT: Umm.. I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. How does it feel to be asking me these questions right now, or talking about this issue?
PATIENT: Well, umm, It feels like it's important. You know sometimes when I um, like have confrontations with people, I don't count them as confrontations but when I confront their feelings and they give me their side It like I feel like its kind of like its squashed in a way, like it..
COUNSELOR: Um Hmm.
PATIENT: Um, I felt that, but then I just moved on, and worked past it. 
COUNSELOR: (0:06:05) So, like today?
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: What do you mean when you say that, what made you feel was squashed? Let me see if I understand. 
PATIENT: I don't remember exactly what you said but it was like, um, you were saying why would that affect you, I'm not older, and I felt myself kind of like withdrawing. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hum. So It kind of felt like I was, um sort of saying that that shouldn't be a factor, like a criticism almost?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: A defense. 
COUNSELOR: A defense from me? 
PATIENT: Um hm. 
COUNSELOR: Well, that could be, because I'm not older, and I can't really change that. I didn't know part of you felt that way. 
PATIENT: Which is okay I mean your just giving me your opinion. But sometimes when other people give me their opinions, I of course think that theirs is, you know, better? I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Uh hm. So yeah, what the important part here is that in conversing about it is by my stating what I felt or my question to you made you feel like that maybe that wasn't right or that wasn't somehow valid, for you to bring up that concern.
PATIENT: Yeah. Sort of. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. 
PATIENT: But I'm willing to see how it goes I mean Id like to do all 30 sessions, and things like that. 
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: I'm kind of vulnerable, I guess I mean. I'm Like swayed easily by opinion. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. 
PATIENT: (Laughs)
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: 0:07:50 You know I see everyone's side, which is I guess in a way is like a good, It a natural thing.
COUNSELOR: And it can put you in a place where you have to withdraw from the situation, too. 
PATIENT: No, then I get their opinion.
COUNSELOR: That's the positive side is that you hear everyone out. 
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean I look at everything objectively. And like I hate, I mean, I get into a discussion about politics, and like the other person is like, politics for example, and the other person is like staunch republican or pro this or you know pro abortion, anti, and after a while and I don't want to have a debate I feel to vulnerable to other peoples opinions.
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Makes a lot of sense. So then can I, let me see if I can understand this: so in terms of what we were talking about before with, you know, who I am, what my credentials are and you feel uncomfortable because you don't know a lot about me, first of all, and secondly you're concerned knowing that I'm younger than you if this is going to be helpful to you. What, what would it be like to work with me? What do you think might happen as we work together? Are there things that you see are either problems, or good things, I mean either way; that that you kind of fantasize about like this might happen? Or I mean we all have certain fears or hopes about things. 
PATIENT: Well, I wasn't thrilled at the last session because, I don't know I felt that um, like, I was talking about a lot of stuff and you were just phrasing it in another way.
COUNSELOR: Uh huh Like rephrasing it then, 
PATIENT: Yeah
COUNSELOR: Didn't reflect it back to you. What did that feel like?
PATIENT: (0:09:52) It was like frustrating you know. Its like, is this what this is all about? You know that I'm going to say something and you're just going to repeat it back, like regurgitate it in another way, so it just felt like it was like canned therapy.
COUNSELOR: Canned therapy?
PATIENT: Canned. You know like textbook 
COUNSELOR: Ohh
PATIENT: You know that was the concern - like she's going to read from a textbook tonight? 
COUNSELOR: Oh of course
PATIENT: (Laughs) Or she didn't read, I don't know, like I felt like I was in good hands in way and Steve said that and it just sort of shifted. But you know on another level like I think that like you're a nice person, you know like I feel comfortable with you.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah. And, and, and I appreciate as you are talking about this, your ability to talk about both things, that your really trying to neutralize some of your feelings, that that feel a little uncomfortable for you to say like it was difficult for me last week. That's a difficult thing for most people to, to let someone else know. 
PATIENT: Umm I guess yeah I just feel like I just want to lay all my feelings on the table. Maybe because I know some of these skills I've been in therapy before, so maybe that's why. 
COUNSELOR: Its real important that we look at those feelings, too even though they're uncomfortable for us to stay with sometimes even the feelings that don't feel so comfortable you know in the context of our relationship it may feel like its being kind of confrontational or a little anxiety producing to talk about. 
PATIENT: See you just did it again. (giggles)
COUNSELOR: What did I do? 
PATIENT: (0:11:53) Like I told you, you said I laid all your feelings on the table, well I said that and in a way, and you confirmed and then you said, you turned it around, and you said that I know it might feel uncomfortable, but its important that you do it. But, I just did it. So I don't feel like you're hearing me. 
COUNSELOR: Oh That you had just done it. 
PATIENT: Yes. 
COUNSELOR: I see I see. No, I think I was more responding to feeling like, there was a point after you said, you know, you had said how you feel about me that there was an uncomfortableness about working with her. But you had sort of said after that that you're a nice person and I like you. So I was sort of talking about that second part, that kind of softened what you had said before a little, or at least I perceived it that way, that it kind of softened it. 
PATIENT: That it kind of neutralized what I said before. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: No, I was just telling you what I was thinking. 
COUNSELOR: Um hm. 
PATIENT: Because if I was totally negative about it that I wouldn't come back. (giggles) So that's what brings me back. You know that I feel comfortable in here. 
COUNSELOR: So going to back to what I am hearing that you're saying is that you're swayed by others peoples opinions. It seems like it's really important that you make the decision then, about being in therapy. 
PATIENT: Well I did initially. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: But you know, Steve my boyfriend he's umm very opinionated. He's.. (giggles) he likes to like interject his opinions too much. (giggles) I mean I had the momentum to go thru all that initial screening, and to make the call an go through it and stuff, but then when he said that I just lost the momentum. 
COUNSELOR: (0:14:10) That you're not motivated to go thru all this?
PATIENT: But you know I can't decide why I'm here is because of the job issue. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm And It may be important for me to sort of clarify too sort of the kind of the style I'm using in therapy with you, it may be different from what you experienced before too, in that, I tend not to focus just on solutions, and that I have the answers for you in some way, but rather that what you and I do in here, like what we just processed with each other, or, is sort of the thing that you can then take with you and help processing other relationships. With bosses, or, 
PATIENT: Yeah but not very boss is going to sit down and have a dialogue like this. I mean... 
COUNSELOR: That's true. That's very true but hopefully what'll be important is that we can shed some light on to what your doing, and you know when you, for example, when you let a boss take, let his opinion overpower what's going on for you. You know what we sort of explored a little bit today might be an important aspect to take with you on maybe how not to do that so much, to let your own voice still stay in the moment and say you know, "I don't think so" or "I disagree with you."
PATIENT: Well I do that anyway, on the surface. 
COUNSELOR: What do you mean, which part do you mean? 
PATIENT: With Steve. 
COUNSELOR: You'll disagree with him you mean. 
PATIENT: (0:16:030 Yeah I'll disagree with him and stand my guard but I mean he's a smart man and he is my confidant.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: Such weird dreams this week, like real frightening. Like one of them was that I was somewhere in a bar, or somewhere like that? Or I was in my childhood and my father was telling me you know he was going to take me up to my room and he was going to like beat me, and have sex with me- (giggles)
COUNSELOR: Oh wow.
PATIENT: At the same time. And then I went back to, the dream had you know had many phases, and at the end of the dream, um, my dog, my childhood dog, that grew up in our house, um, he like came back to life, but in the mean time.. He died when I was like 15, no he died when I was about 25. And he was only like 10 years old when he died he got hit by a car he was a great dog, and um, he apparently my dream he had gone to another life and then came back again and he was a Cocker Spaniel and someone came to get me and said that in his previous life he was so badly abused and beaten, and all this stuff, and when I went to hold him, because I knew it would make him better, like feel better you know. But he was so broken down it was horrible. 
COUNSELOR: (0:18:05) Wow this just happened last night? 
PATIENT: No I would say Monday night. 
COUNSELOR: What did you think of it? I mean did you run over it in the morning?
PATIENT: Yeah it was bad, so... 
COUNSELOR: What did you think, about it? Did you construct some meaning from it? From your dream? 
PATIENT: Umm... Well I thought about it, especially the dog part, because the Spaniel was like a different color than my dog, and his hair was like, like I don't know, like thicker or something. He looked like a different dog but, they were both Spaniels. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. 
PATIENT: And you know part of the like problem with the abuse with my parents; was that, you know I'm seeing them this weekend. Yeah we're going away - 
COUNSELOR: Oh. 
PATIENT: Maybe that's it too they're coming in. But at any rate, um you know I relate to them on a totally different level and it's totally amicable. But, they were different people as I was back then too, and one of the problems was just recalling the abuse from a dream like that was, just the frustration of my mind would appear, the sex and the violence part of the same coin, like frightens me totally. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Because I felt somewhere like in my brain it just got stored as the same kind of emotion. 
COUNSELOR: (0:19:58) Um hmm. 
PATIENT: Because I'm not into kinky sex at all, (giggles) but I mean that its just that I'm afraid that somewhere inside of me I am going to let these bosses beat me up or something like that. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm That's really powerful. 
PATIENT: And um, I don't know. It just weird that I think that I'm going to get aroused by thinking about it, or... You know I just want it to go away. 
COUNSELOR: So let me see if I understand this - After you thought about this, you are starting to make some connections between with the sex and the violence that you might have that somewhere within yourself someplace that its all kind of connected, is that your fear? Sexual favor?
PATIENT: Um well, on some level, because my father wanted to take me in his room and have sex with me and beat me. He really made me feel like such a piece of shit in the dream Oh I know what too I was reading this very powerful novel, by Wally Brown, it's his latest one called "This Might Be True" or something, you must have heard of it, right?
COUNSELOR: Well, I might have. 
PATIENT: Well it's about 900 pages so I've been reading it for like a week. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hm.
PATIENT: And it's a story about these 2 twin brothers, and Wally Brown has published 2 very psychological books - "She's Come Undone", and something like "This Must Be True". And so it a story about these twins, they're 2 boys, and one of them is schizophrenic and one is just normal. 
COUNSELOR: (0:22:11) Uh hmm.
PATIENT: And he lives, they with their mother and step father, and his step father is for some reason, he gets along with on one of the twins but the one that later will develop <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>, he picks on. He like beats him to death, he's always on his case, he's always like taking him in his room and ripping his belt off, just whatever, just beating him. And then kid develops like, <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>, and its all about his <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia2"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> and when he dies. He finally cuts his hand off cause he thinks that when he dies he's going to save the world. And, so anyway, actually he cuts his had off in the beginning of the book so its very boring at the end, after that.
COUNSELOR: Uh hm.
PATIENT: It was just, it was a very powerful book. So I finished it and went to bed and then I dreamed that. And I do think that my father used to pick on me, too. I mean my sister said he used to pick on her too, but he was a mean, he was horrible man... 
COUNSELOR: And you remember him picking on you too, that's a powerful memory that you have.
PATIENT: Well what I wanted was a like father, which is what I thought I deserved, was like a father who you know would spoil me and tell me that I'm pretty and whatever. But this one was like mean and selfish, and hitting, and you know and suddenly my sister said its not that he beat us he tells us I'm going to pull your pants down (laughs) like do all these things but describing a whore, and then she said she would have a hard on (laughs) just describing him doing it. 
COUNSELOR: (0:24:18) So in her mind too it sounds like there was some connection too to this violence and sex.
PATIENT: Oh yeah for sure.
COUNSELOR: Did he ever sexually abuse you or your sister? 
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Is there any suspicion of him, like you wondered, or your sister wondered about that?
PATIENT: Um, no. I think someone else did it, (giggles). It could be my imagination, but just somewhere in the like back of my mind before I even knew language, or before I even know, when I was a baby I think someone else did it for some reason. I think there is no way of ever knowing. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. 
PATIENT: But it's amazing that I would think before I had the feeling, I mean. Do you think the mind records something even though it doesn't know language? 
COUNSELOR: Well I mean it's hard to say, for us to know like exactly what happened then. But I know one thing, I mean just from us talking and sort of some if the themes that have started emerging in terms of what happens for you is that sex and violence, somehow have come together like you were talking about, like in your dream. Or this comment that your sister made about your father, somewhere in your experience, both of those things may have some real similar experiences for you, you know whether its someone verbally abusing you, or physically, or you know having sex, all of those are connected. Do you have any sense of what the common experience is for you, or is there one? Am I making that assumption here, but that you might experience them similarly. Being on the other..
PATIENT: (0:26:20)No. No..
COUNSELOR: What do you think was the connection, making you dream?
PATIENT: Umm.. I think it's like really, well the connection is the book definitely. 
COUNSELOR: Can you say more about that, like what parts of the book you because you were telling me about your father right? You were saying that he would tell you that he was going too..
PATIENT: Well my sister said that, that was her comment.
COUNSELOR: What do you remember?
PATIENT: I just remember like being like totally traumatized. He hit with me with his belt a few times when I was like nine. And a daughter should be like a jewel. A father and daughter are supposed to have like a rapport, but there was no rapport. I felt like I was the enemy. Like what can a nine year old kid do? Like I'm still kind of in shock that he did that. He just wanted to put me in my place so badly. I felt like it was the ultimate, I don't know, like betrayal.
COUNSELOR: (0:27:52) Uh hmm. Thanks. That's a really good word you used to describe that feeling, betrayal. Can you say more about that, that betrayal by him? 
PATIENT: Well my mother used to beat the shit out of us all day, about stupid little stuff like spilled milk or we left crumbs or we didn't make our bed. Never anything that would help as human being like, we didn't do our home work, (giggles) or you know didn't practice piano or, which she never even would buy us a piano. Because she had to have things her way, totally. Her main focus, she was a very simple woman, and very shallow and she thinks that she needs a nice house and home and it should be very neat. And um she was kind of a closet slob because everything was in the surface for me. She was always the epitome of shallowness. So when we were playing or making a mess her palace was like upset. 
COUNSELOR: Upset? 
PATIENT: Yeah, so she didn't really function as a normal woman, We never got help with school, it was all about her. She's tired, she's this, or I mean she did sacrifice some things, she was a good natured person in some ways. She was good about driving people places and things like that. But she never encouraged us to do anything. I don't think she had the, I mean she's a selfish person, and I don't think she had the mental capacity for anything much else. 
COUNSELOR: (0:30:06)Can I ask you a question, just checking because I was thinking to myself sort of, and I was feeling kind of distracted. How did it feel when I asked you about, to elucidate on the betrayal on your, by your dad? Can you elucidate on your experience? 
PATIENT: Well, it kind of, like, it felt kind of good finding that word, like finding a word that came to my mind, that fit my situation. So it felt good. 
COUNSELOR: Would you say that was an accurate word?
PATIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: Do you think it's important... I think it's important that that word has some meaning for you, more than it has some meaning for me. Did it feel like it has some meaning for you?
PATIENT: Well yeah, because I said it, and well, it felt like it was the right word. 
COUNSELOR: I just wanted to sort of shed some light on that, given that we just we had just talked about what I said about how you influence your own feelings and what's going on, and that doesn't sound right you know betrayal? Your father? If your experience might have been different to you depending on what my reaction was. 
PATIENT: No, it felt actually felt good at the time. 
COUNSELOR: It did. 
PATIENT: So. 
COUNSELOR: You're looking at your watch, are you concerned about he time? 
PATIENT: (0:32:16) No. I just wanted to know what time it was. So my mother was like a... 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. 
PATIENT: I don't know so she would hit us all day long and call us stupid stuff, and something inside of me thought that maybe he would soften her or rescue me and she just, you know made him mad at us. 
COUNSELOR: I see.
PATIENT: Yeah, I mean here I was a little kid pining for attention and all I got was more negative attention. 
COUNSELOR: Um Hmm. So you were expecting your dad to come home to save you from this, from this anger from you mother. 
PATIENT: Yeah, and basically be just became a scary distant person to me. I never felt comfortable touching him, or coming near him, He would just snap. He was a very stressed out man. It just wasn't you know the whole childhood wasn't a very positive experience to say the least. It was very frightening, and I never felt like I had a good foundation. And this poor foundation, kind of influenced me my whole life. I think it's why I'm like worse. I think it's why I never really had any direction, or influence or, I just and so confused, and like trying to figure out and acting out these trial things that I have all the time. 
COUNSELOR: (0:34:04) What were you acting out. 
I don't know, like trying something out in Arizona with that guy, and having it not, you know running from him because he was so abusive. So going back to my parents, Ohio, to start again then living in a house with some adult, and contributing what I shouldn't. Things like that. 
COUNSELOR: Some how recreating that same experience. 
PATIENT: I guess, yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Did you blame yourself for that? I sense some self criticism there, is that?
PATIENT: No. I don't think I could have done it any differently with what I, you know, with what I had. 
COUNSELOR: It sounds like you were trying the best that you could in this process. 
PATIENT: Right but I think that it kind of surfaced what was happening, and I kind of crashed. But anyway so then I met Steve like umpteen years later, and he's a lot older. He's like 10 years older than me, and he's had 2 wives. And they're all like very pretty women. They're all like models and actresses and all this stuff.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: And so who know what they had in their back ground, if they had a nurturing background. And you know their mothers took them to the store, and taught them how to wear makeup and bought them clothes. and all that stuff. I mean I had like none of those skills, and Steve was like my mother and father for the first 2 years. He took me to the makeup counter and clothes and taught me all these fundamentals that I just never knew. 
COUNSELOR: (0:36:04) Um hmm
PATIENT: Not only about myself but about like every kind of household things. Just things like that. He was very smart in that way. 
COUNSELOR: You found someone who could take care of you in way that you were missing from your childhood. 
PATIENT: Well he was quick to diagnose that because I lacked things, that he saw where my parents, usually your parents teach you those things. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, uh hmm. 
PATIENT: They teach you how to do laundry right, or (giggle) they show you, and they nurture you and send you to camp. Like my parents did none of that. 
COUNSELOR: Gosh.
PATIENT: And they just I don't know what was going on in their minds, but I guess it was all about them. You know Steve would say, "you're a diamond in the rough." 
COUNSELOR: How did you take that comment? How did you feel when he said that?
PATIENT: I don't know exactly how I felt at the time.
PATIENT: But I knew that it was like just shape up or ship out. 
COUNSELOR: To be accepted by him?
PATIENT: Yeah so I decided to go the high road, you know just do that. Rather than be my father for 2 years. Things changed. 
COUNSELOR: How so? What happened next, for those 2 years?
PATIENT: (0:37:57) But also you know I used to accept like these like stupid jobs and because used to think I was like stupid and I could get anything better. Well when he came into my life 4 years ago I had this like, this job at this technical job at this like architectural society and he would say. He like told me you have to get out of there its so boring So the past four years of my work history have been kind of sketchy, where he has been involved. I mean I don't know if it's because of him. It really began to escalate since his appearance in my life. I mean I think it's because I've really upgraded myself you know emotionally and physically and that part hasn't caught up yet. And you can put on different make up and shoes and things like that but it's more complex you know, working situations. 
COUNSELOR: I guess I'm guilty with you talking in a way of colluding with you in a way about accepting that somehow before you met Steve that you didn't know how to take care of yourself, that you know that you were stupid, or that you didn't know how to dress, and I kind of feel myself as I'm kind of shaking my head, agreeing with you and that doesn't feel right to me. Are you aware of any feeling about that?
PATIENT: I think it feels good when you agree with me. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hm.
PATIENT: Not that you know because its, what's the word, it's like a show of support. 
COUNSELOR: (0:40:08) Yeah I guess in trying to support what you're saying I guess what I sort of saying s that I did that for a little while, realized that maybe I'm colluding this part of you that is kind of devouring yourself and what your saying too. 
PATIENT: Well its like I did dress, its not like I went out with a sheet on but its like I didn't know what colors looked good on me. I dressed okay but not to exceed you know like, yada yada. (ph) 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: Maybe I just want to exceed like the things, not be middle of the road.
COUNSELOR: So it helped you feel like you were better than you were before. 
PATIENT: Uh huh.
COUNSELOR: It takes a very strong person to go have gone thru the kinds of abusive history that you've gone thru with your parents. I can't imagine that you left that situation as a young adult really not equipped to take care of yourself. Really in those situations people end up learning how to take care of themselves even more. And I can't think your experience was different. I mean I'm sure you are already taking care of yourself in the best way. 
PATIENT: Yeah I was, for sure. But let's see. I guess I was doing like the necessities?
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: I guess.
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. And this was sort of the icing, to be able to exceed? 
PATIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: (0:42:04) I guess its important for me to just be aware that you were the one making those decisions, that you wanted something better for yourself. And that Steve was an important factor I that in your life, and that you were sort of open to that, and you've seeked that out, too. 
PATIENT: Well I was always alive, even as a small child, who used to want my father to like rescue me like I always felt that I deserved to be like the little princess you know in the little story books that I was reading. You know the man comes and saves them, the little princess who has beautiful things, and... Whatever. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: I forgot what I was saying. Not that he, you know, I wasn't ready for him, that's not what our relationship is about. It about right now, we got past that and now its just about sharing and feelings, you know things like that. You know beyond the physical. You know that kind of physical. 
COUNSELOR: So you've been taking care of him? 
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Rescuing him?
PATIENT: But always back when I was a little girl I always wanted to do that but I never had a vehicle. Nobody at the time wanted to do that for me. 
COUNSELOR: It sounds like you feel a lot of appreciation towards Steve for what he's given you. 
PATIENT: Yes. 
PATIENT: But most of all I really like him as a person. 
COUNSELOR: What do you lie about him? 
PATIENT: (0:44:01) I really think that he's the one of the most kindest and givingest people in the world. 
COUNSELOR: UH hmm.
PATIENT: He's got like this hard protective edge, you don't really see that.
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: But I like him I thing he's really funny. I think he's really clever. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: I like the fact that he's a dentist. 
COUNSELOR: My teeth hurt (giggles). 
PATIENT: Yeah because its like well you know it boosts my self esteem. I mean they don't know how hard he struggles. (giggles) Like this one doesn't pay him and that one, 
COUNSELOR: (Giggles)
PATIENT: You know? He's got this ramped up skyline. (ph) But they think automatically he's a dentist, he's rich. 
COUNSELOR: So I remember something it helps you feel like you are associated with, I remember you were telling me about that in the first session about being near the boss helps you - 
PATIENT: Yeah, that's good. (Giggles) Yeah it was just, that was all self aggrandizement in a way? Like I want to feel important.
COUNSELOR: Would you feel important without some of that? Like without the other parts of it, whether it's the other person? 
PATIENT: No. 
COUNSELOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Only because I know being in a relationship makes me happy. I remember when I came home and there was no one to come home to and it was like being around all these assholes, and jerks. You know I feel like a rich person. 
COUNSELOR: (0:46:01) Uh hmm. So it is really important for you to be in this relationship it sounds like. 
PATIENT: Yes.
COUNSELOR: And I wasn't suggesting at you not be in this relationship, but now you can start developing some feeling for that you're an important person no matter if you're with Steve, or in therapy, or at work or, you know yon now or at a cafe sitting somewhere by yourself. 
PATIENT: Well maybe I take that back, I mean I'm used to, I imagine ill be in this relationship for a long time. So I'm used to it if I wasn't if I was in relationship with someone else, I would feel important even if it was someone else, as long as the guy was like respectable. 
COUNSELOR: So the pattern it sounds like its important how the person responds to you. Do you know how you feel about yourself? 
PATIENT: I don't know, I think that's like jumping the gun a little. 
COUNSELOR: Tell me what's going on. 
PATIENT: If anything Steve is an aloof person he can look the same for like 2 hours. I don't always know always how he's responding to me. 
COUNSELOR: Oh. 
PATIENT: I think its important like to be happy inside. That makes me feel like I'm important to others if I m happy. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. 
PATIENT: I don't know if that answers the question. (giggles)
COUNSELOR: Well it sounds little your saving your own importance for yourself to feel important that it is to or as feel good about yourself and it allows you to see yourself being, as a giving person. Is that right, as a giving person? 
PATIENT: (0:48:02) No I think that's human nature, or at least that's how it is in Ohio. That you know, its who you know or, forever, maybe my reaction's superficially with people if I said that doesn't really work. Or if I asked for some car dealer or asked for um, you know, GM. Certainly GM, would sound like, "oh I know GM!" Certainly that would sound better. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. 
PATIENT: So you know, prestige attracts me. 
COUNSELOR: And I guess I'm wondering if that part of it is what helps you feel important? That having sort of that association is what makes you feel... 
PATIENT: Yeah I think being important makes you feel important. 
COUNSELOR: What helps you feel important? Or have you be important. 
PATIENT: I guess being associated with people that are important. 
COUNSELOR: What kinds of things do you do? Are there things that you might do that would also help you with that? 
PATIENT: It's just like all (sp) itself? In a profession where basically, in Ohio is like a service city All the professions basically are service professions. You know whether its medical, you know business wise, stock market, everything. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hm. 
PATIENT: (0:49:55) So even if I was the CEO, I would be in a service profession, I would be servicing someone. So like the CEO is important because he's dependent on people. I think everyone is interdependent on each other. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: So given a sense of who they are.
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: I think everyone is a mirror to our own souls. 
COUNSELOR: Nice way to put it. 
PATIENT: Oh thank you. Oh And then I had dream, too. This was another frightening dream. I w1as getting fired from this job, this tech job, this stupid tech job, where they were like sabotaging me, and they were going to fire me.
COUNSELOR: Like the job you're in now? 
PATIENT: Yeah, I mean it was like "who are you to care", this stupid job, doing nothing in a bank. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: But like my ego was just strained because of all these horrible experience at the job. 
COUNSELOR: But it frightens you to feel like this job is important to you, it sounds like, and to lose it might hurt you in some way? 
PATIENT: But its not, but I just think maybe it was just me. It's like I guess the widow who just keeps losing husbands, or something (Giggles) like why does that happen?
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: And one day I had a nice dream in between like these horrible dreams, and it was lie the my friend Jerry who actually died he was dead but like he and I read this umm, a river bed and we were looking down from this bridge to this river there were people below and it was the most beautiful river I'd ever seen it was so pure, and people were just swimming the water was clear. Kind of like for some reason it was in Ireland? Maybe he was Irish. So maybe it was Ireland. And I just really woke up so good, and now I want to go to Ireland now. (Giggles) 
COUNSELOR: (0:52:30) Uh hmm.
PATIENT: And I that, like, I read a book, about, and I actually had believed this before but that's when people had died, that how, a big way they come back, from wherever they are, you know like in this afterlife thing. that they come back and that's the easiest way for them to communicate. Because I think he was really there, you know wherever, and he was like showing me this place. Maybe that's where he is now, this place. 
COUNSELOR: That's neat. 
PATIENT: But when he first died I used to have some really scary nightmares about him. Like he was would like he was a very over sexed person, and I never went to bed with him, but he really fucked around a lot, and then he caught AIDS, I guess, that's how...
COUNSELOR: Oh. That how he died. 
PATIENT: Yeah. That's how he died. And he was like such a great guy, so funny. God. But he was a great guy, but he just fucked around so much, he just liked the challenge of conquering women. So when he fist died I had this dream that I was in this bar with him, and I knew he was dead and he did too a but he was still trying to pick me up anyway, and he had like this, he looked like him, but had this, weird like, his eyes he looked like he was dead, and I was so frightened, he looked like his eyes were glazed over. 
COUNSELOR: (0:54:20) What did you think about the connection of him being dead, did it freak you out?
PATIENT: Well he told me how good I looked too, he said you look great because I hadn't seen him for years before that. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: I remember he hadn't really advanced that much, since it was like this inner chi thing (giggles) He was almost like a vampire. 
COUNSELOR: Someone scary that was trying to take you away?
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Alright. I guess I'm a little worried that we had sort of talked about our relationship at the beginning as it split, in the time we have left to just sort of bring back to focus here to try and figure out what was going on in the room with us and then we kind of went to your dreams and started to talk about your dreams. How did it feel to talk about that and shift away from our relationship?
PATIENT: I had shifted on purpose, because I felt that we had exhausted the conversation, and I felt good because I told o what I thought it was just time to move on.. 
COUNSELOR: I guess I wanted to find out though, if you felt like there was some resolution, or questions, because it doesn't feel finished to me. You know it kind feels like something that we need to check in on, because I'm aware of sort of the influence that I can have on you, in suggesting things to you or influencing your decisions, just because I'm another person who can take that in. 
PATIENT: I don't think you've been influencing me. Because it's not like you're giving me some strong opinions. Maybe more like subtleties or something like that. 
COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.
PATIENT: You know my focus is, it just feels good to be talking about this. Is that what I'm supposed to be doing?
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I guess what would be important is that in here we do talk about what's going for you right now whether its your relationship with Steve or that we can kind of create a space in here that you can start talking about you dreams if that's what's sort of on your mind or....
PATIENT: But That's what I was creating.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. I didn't mean for that to sound like a criticism, it may have, but that you had moved away from it but I just wanted to sort of bring that focus back to our relationship too, so that were able to continue to talk about it in future sessions. And we can go ahead and sort of close the chapter on it, because things change all the time and I just want you to sort of be aware of it. So that your voice is heard in here too, its not just like you bring up an issue and I react to it and then the book closes. 
PATIENT: No, I will let you know when I feel certain things. Which is what I did, I could have not said anything. 
COUNSELOR: I know its real important that you did that I feel very glad that, as it is we have progressed here, but it felt really powerful to be speaking to you about that, earlier. 
(0:58:01) Yeah for me too. 
COUNSELOR: I felt powerful just being about to speak to you about something very real that was happening between us. 
PATIENT: Right but I just don't like, I just felt I had addressed it, and I wanted to... 
COUNSELOR: Drop it?
PATIENT: Well I was going to say beat a dead dog. (laughs) Probably not the right word, or the right image.
COUNSELOR: OK Well we'll just sort make that part of the contract that we'll keep a handle on everything. 
PATIENT: Ok. Do you, can you do a quarter to six.
COUNSELOR: Did you want to do a quarter to six? 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: That'll be fine. If we can keep a steady time that will be important to sign out when you..
PATIENT: Yeah yeah definitely. 
COUNSELOR: Okay. 
COUNSELOR: Has that been working out okay I terms of getting it mailed out and everything? 
PATIENT: Yeah I've been doing it on the ferry and it's nice, and I get it done right away.
COUNSELOR: Okay. 
PATIENT: Yeah I'm cooperative. 
COUNSELOR: (Laughs) Yeah, sure you are. People pleaser that you are. (Laughs) So, next week a quarter of. 
PATIENT: Okay. 
COUNSELOR: Alright you have a good trip. 
PATIENT: Thank you.
PATIENT: I have to do all sorts of laundry and stuff. 
COUNSELOR: Uh and you can turn that off too. 
PATIENT: Alright, Thank you. Bye.
