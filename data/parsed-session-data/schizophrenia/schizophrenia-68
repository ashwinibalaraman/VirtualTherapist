BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	All right, [PATIENT NAME].  Tell me, how have you been doing, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it's been, it's just both the extremes really.  I don't really have a middle.  One minute, I'll be just bland and, you know, blase, and not really interested in anything, and the next minute, I'll be extremely excited and, you know, really to run a marathon or something, and I can't really sleep that well at all.  I'll stay up to maybe 4 or 5:00 and then start feeling tired and, I mean, after I wake up at 8:00 in the morning, I'll just be able to stay up that long, and, of course, I have to get up early to help my mom watch my little sister, and I'll just be extremely tired and not able to move and sometimes I'll, I'll daze out in just the middle of the day and fall asleep.
<b>DR:</b>	Now, how long you've been struggling with this highs and lows?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, since my step dad died.  It pro, it'll probably be more than 2 and a half years ago.
<b>DR:</b>	Ever since you were what, [AGE]?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And he committed suicide, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, ma'am.
<b>DR:</b>	Now when you say you had in your highs, what are your symptoms?  You go without sleep—
<b>PT:</b>	Um.
<b>DR:</b>	How many days and, how many days and nights you have gone without sleeping?
<b>PT:</b>	The most has been probably 3 or 4 days.
<b>DR:</b>	And don't feel tired even during that time?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm sorry?
<b>DR:</b>	You, when you don't go to sleep 3, 4 days at a time, you don't feel tired?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You just go, go, go?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	During this time, have you ever done anything that, using poor judgment, like spending too much money—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Using poor judgment as to during with people—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Being impulsive?  Tell me about it.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I, like I got $100 for my birthday, and immediately, as soon as I got the check, I went and cashed it, and spent it all on just stupid things, like, um, I don't even draw much, but for some reason, I had the impulse to draw, uh, to buy a bunch of drawing items, such as markers and paints and stuff like that, paint brushes and paint canvas and things like that, and I don't even paint or draw.  Uh, uh, um, I'll maybe decide to walk even though I hate exercising just because, um, I've gotten a lot bigger over a period of 2 years—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And my anger outbursts are longer and quicker to come whenever I'm in that kind of state.
<b>DR:</b>	And how bad anger outburst gets?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, punching holes in walls, throwing things, like I, the other day, I  broke my mother's phone.  We have 2 handheld phones that can come off the receiver, and you can go anywhere in the house with it, and I got in a huge fight with my mother and through my phone across the wall and it broke in half, and I'm a big guy, so it didn't surprise me that it broke, just the fact that I did break it, you know, worried me, and I'm just, I'm really quick to get irritated at—
<b>DR:</b>	Have you ever gotten yourself in like school problem—
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Are you good in school?  Any behavior problem?
<b>PT:</b>	Just talking too much and not paying attention.
<b>DR:</b>	So did you finish school?  Did you have to quit or dropped out or what happens?
<b>PT:</b>	I dropped out.
<b>DR:</b>	Why?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, well, maybe 2 things.  One, I was, I would cry during the middle of school just because of my dad and I hate, I hate crying in public anyway, and especially in front of all my friends, you know, when I want to try to impress them and do the whole high school thing, and it was making my sports suffer, 'cause I used to play football and wrestling, and I just, I didn't have, I didn't care to do it anymore.  I used to wrestle with my dad, and so that brought back painful memories of having fun with him and stuff.  I just didn't want to do it.
<b>DR:</b>	After he killed himself?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Um, I started pulling away from all my friends, and so I really didn't have a reason to stay because I really didn't care about school.
<b>DR:</b>	What grade did you drop out?
<b>PT:</b>	In 10th grade.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you get your GED later?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	So are you planning to pursue anything like you, going to school now?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Like what?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm gonna take a CNA class this Monday, uh, this coming Monday actually.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, you wanna be CNA?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, hopefully after I get enough money for college, I wanna go and to school for at least 2 years to start pursuing a physical therapists assistant, um, you know, career down that road.  Maybe one day, I'll become a physical therapist.
<b>DR:</b>	Now, when you say you stay high then low, so how long your highs seem to last?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, it, it can last anywhere from, you know, maybe 5 minutes to 4 days I guess, staying up all night and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b>	And nothing brings it on?  It just comes on?
<b>PT:</b>	Right, and the only thing that can be brought on is the, the anger, the irritation, 'cause maybe somebody's doing something I don't like, making a noise.  Maybe a baby cries in a store, I'm just like ahhh, you know, irritated as, as hell.  I can't, I can't stand it.
<b>DR:</b>	And when you have depression, tell me, what do you do when you are in depressed mood?
<b>PT:</b>	Usually, I pull away from everybody.  I'll stay by myself.  I won't exercise.  I'll overeat.  I'll smoke way too many cigarettes, um, basically just anything that will hurt me without actually killing myself.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you ever tried to kill yourself?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	When?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, actually a couple years ago, I tried to, um, no, actually it wasn't a couple years ago.  It was maybe 5 months ago.  I, I drank a whole bottle of liquor and it was an [INAUDIBLE] bottle so it was really big, and also snorted pills like cocaine at the same time, trying to kill myself, and it didn't work.
<b>DR:</b>	How long have you been doing drugs?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I real, I don't do drugs.  It was just that one time, hoping that it would work because alcoholism runs in my family like crazy so I thought maybe it would help to do it.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] so one time you did alcohol?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And what happened?  Did you end up in hospital or what happened?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I, I didn't go to the hospital because I was taking drugs illegally, obviously, 'cause they weren't prescribed to me.  Uh, we bought them from some friend of my friends, and had like a, just 3 people.  They were just taking drugs for the fun of it.  I was trying to kill myself.  They didn't know that or else, obviously, they wouldn't let me go, but guess what I was trying to do.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you have any crying spells when you're in a depressed mood?
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes.  Most of the time, I won't let myself cry 'cause I'll just, I hate crying, but when I do cry, it's uncontrollable.  I can't stop and, I mean, I'm at the point where I could just sit, lay in bed all day, and not say anything to anybody and just cry.
<b>DR:</b>	Now you said you were in [DEIDENTIFIED].  How old were you when you were in [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, like a mental hospital?
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, probably 12, 13.
<b>DR:</b>	What happened then?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I was just depressed because of, one of my stepfathers, you know, my mom's been married 4 times, and this one actually beat me and her and, you know, I've, I've seen him choke her on the couch and do just crazy things to her and, I mean, I don't, I don't know, it's hard to just explain.  I was depressed and upset, and I really hated him, and it got so bad one time, he, you know, he was beating my mom and choking her, and I could hear him doing that to her in the other room, and so, and I was a pretty big kid even at 12, 13, so I kicked the door in and had a pocketknife on me, and it got to the point where I stuck it up to his throat and said if you hurt my mom again, I'll kill you.  You know, it's just insane stuff, so, eventually my mother got away from him for a while and, but, you know, I was put in the mental hospital just to deal with, uh, anger and depression and it seemed like everything was going good in there 'cause I had people who were dealing with the same things and I was talking to people who knew what I was going through, and everything just seemed okay.  Just when I got back ou, it just seemed like the same again.
<b>DR:</b>	Most things started back?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So they gave you the medication then?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	That worked?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you [INAUDIBLE] con, continue the treatment?
<b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Just 'cause I've always been told that pills are back and plus, I've seen my mother abuse pills back when she was a drug addict, abuse pills, you know, smoke weed, and stuff like that, and, I don't know, I just don't like what they did to my mom, and they just kind of scare me sometimes, but I guess they're the only thing that helped me.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So now, you decided to get some help?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Why?
<b>PT:</b>	I, I don't like the way that I am.  It's almost safe to say that I hate the way that I am.  I'm just struggling a lot with anger towards my stepfather and myself really, 1, for letting myself get this bad and, you know, not asking for help and not caring what anybody had to say, and 2, for, you know, giving my heart away again after 3 times of failure and, where I've found myself out now with my stepfather who just killed himself was, you know, at first he was like my dream come true just, my dad who spent time with me and loved me and all that.  After he left, just this, it felt the same way.  They all left before and, you know, why not now?  It doesn't seem that anybody cares about me except for my mother and, I don't know.  I can't even control my anger towards her.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you ever been violent with your mom or family?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I've never hit anybody in my family because I, I believe that hitting women is wrong in any way, shape, or form on accident, you know, or on purpose, but I've, you know, I've, I've threatened to, like, um, you know, said things just out of anger.
<b>DR:</b>	Excuse me.  Have you ever gotten yourself in trouble with law?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Like what?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, one time I had my anger outbursts, let me see, probably about a year ago—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I started throwing things around my room, punching holes, I even kicked a huge hole in my wall, and my mom thought I was on steroids or something and, and called my, called my uncle, who I worked out with, and asked how my weightlifting progress had gone.  He said he's doing, you know, very well or whatever, and she thought I was on steroids and called the cops on me, and they did a drug test on me, and I passed all of them and all that, and so I didn't have any, I've never, never really taken drugs.  I've, I've drank before at a party, you know, just trying to have fun, the high school thing, but I didn't really have fun, and, uh, beer.  I ended up puking and passing out somewhere and so just, it's not fun doing it.  It's stupid, but, uh, so they put me in a drug court program, and that was when I got in trouble with the law for freaking out I guess, but, uh, they put me in a program called Drug Corp, and I stayed there for about a year, and even though I passed all my drug tests and never did anything involved with drugs, I was, they looked at me as like the worse kid, 'cause for a while, they thought I was figuring out a way to hide it and still use drugs, and I just, I don't know anything about it.  I, I don't use it.  I'm trying to get out of here.  I don't like this program, 'cause I had to go there 3 days a week, and it, and it took up time from maybe fun stuff to do or just, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	You have never abused drugs, though?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you never?
<b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b>	Marijuana, nothing?
<b>PT:</b>	Nope.  I've used marijuana 1 time and quit, and ever since, I've never done it.  It, uh, it made me more, more sick than when I drank alcohol that 1 time.
<b>DR:</b>	So you don't drink or—
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you allergic to any medications?
<b>PT:</b>	Not that I know of.  I don't think I've ever done a test, but I've taken lots of things from my doctors, you know.  Of course, I never stuck with it, but they prescribed me things, and took it maybe once or twice, and never had any problems with it, just didn't take it.
<b>DR:</b>	So, your mom said that you were diagnosed with attention deficit disorder?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	When?
<b>PT:</b>	In, um, really I've diagnosed with it all my life.  Teachers would say to my doctors, 'cause they'd call, asking questions about it, and they said that, which is true, 'cause I've noticed it myself.  I'll sit there, like say my mom sat down to talk with me, like after 2 minutes, I'll like look around or, you know, start tapping my foot or messing [INAUDIBLE] not purposely not paying attention when they're, like on accident.  I'll purposely divert my attention, like this, not, not, I don't know that I'm doing it, but my body does it and I'm just, "wait, what'd you say?"  You know, something like that.  It's hard to explain.  I just dripped off I guess.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you ever been on any medication for that?
<b>PT:</b>	A long time ago.
<b>DR:</b>	Like what?
<b>PT:</b>	When I was in 3rd grade, they diagnosed me with it, and I was making [INAUDIBLE], 3rd, 3rd grader, don't even care about school or even try to make friends and hang out, but, um, anyway.  They put me on some kind of medication.  I think it was Adderall, and —
<b>DR:</b>	Did that help at all or—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  I, I went from making F's to making A, A's.
<b>DR:</b>	And then they stopped?
<b>PT:</b>	And then I stopped and, of course, history repeated itself, and I made F's and D's and C's again.
<b>DR:</b>	How is your physical health?  Okay?
<b>PT:</b>	That's horrible.  Um, 'cause I smoked cigarettes, and I gained 100 pounds in half a year 'cause I was so depressed and just eating all the time, and the reason why I think that started is because when I first found out about [NAME OTHER] killing himself, it was after I got out of wrestling practice.  My mother came to pick me up, which was weird in the first place 'cause my dad usually picked me up and, um, brought me home, and it was the same routine everyday, and all of the sudden my mom shows.  Uh, I just knew something was wrong 'cause [NAME OTHER] had gone missing a couple days before 'cause he would, he would go out and use crack and come home, and, um, so this last time, he was gone for about 3 or 4 days, and we had no idea where the hell he was and just confused, you know, why, why is he doing this again 'cause he took all of the money out of our bank account and, uh, went and spent it on drugs and [INAUDIBLE], and I guess eventually decided to kill himself, and when I found that out at school, I broke down in the parking lot and, of course, everybody's arguing about who's gonna pay for the funeral.  I just couldn't believe it.  You know, I was like he's dead and ya'll are gonna argue right now?  And so we, I got pissed off at everybody and didn't even want to talk to anyone, so we drove home to our house and there's like 14, 15 people just sitting in the house, and I was like I wanna be left alone.  I was like all these people aren't gonna make me feel better.  It doesn't matter what you say to me, I just wanna be left alone.  Of course, everybody kept knocking on my door, knocking on my door, and telling me I needed to eat something, and they were really just driving me crazy.  I just wanted to be alone, and eventually I just came out there 'cause nobody was leaving me the hell alone, and they told me to eat or whatever or to sit down, and I was like I don't wanna eat anything.  Um, I don't feel like eating, and they made me eat tons and tons and tons of things, and I guess this is how I learned to cope with it, just with eating.
<b>DR:</b>	So except for 1 time, you have never been treated for, inpatient you were only 1 time?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b>	And, I mean, maybe that's what I need.  Maybe I just need a counselor to talk to, maybe I need medicine.  I don't know.  I just—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, you have a strong family history.  Your biological father there is a strong history of bipolar and <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> too, right?
<b>PT:</b>	And I don't even know anything about him because he left when I was 2 weeks old.  I had just been born 2 weeks, and he, he left, and I only saw him 1 time, when I was 5 years old, and that was for a couple hours, and I didn't like him.  I never went back.  Haven't seen him since.
<b>DR:</b>	And what is this your mom talks about, there's a history of <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> in your father—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, in her, in her father—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, her dad—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Your mom is also—
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know my father.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Just, just met him one day and didn't like him.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well, let me see.  Maybe we need to put you on a [INAUDIBLE] anger outbursts [INAUDIBLE].
