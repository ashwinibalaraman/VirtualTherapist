<i>Sunday, 20th September, 1964</i>


IFELT better than usual this morning because Kay was coming
with a friend of hers from that analytical centre of theirs. The
girl, Marion, had been a deputy on ward D and wanted to
visit.


Sister Zukov has just returned from some off duty. She is still
reading <i>Nothing To Lose</i>, and has already pronounced it, ‘Excellent.
Excellent.’ But as she says this about every literary effort of
mine, I don't feel flattered.


In Friday's <i>Nursing Notes</i>, a letter of mine -- under one of my
pseudonyms -- has caused fireworks. It dealt with the qualities
lacking in male nurses, but was toned down with a tongue-in-the-cheek
approach. Even so, the journal devoted two pages to
indignant letters from enraged male nurses. It is interesting that
all the letters pounced on a minor point in my letter concerning
the effeminacy of some male nurses.


After deliberation, I compiled my reply, and it has run into
four quarto pages, for I have brought out into the open the
question of latent homosexuality in all nurses. I doubt whether
the editor will print it, but I shall be interested to see the reactions
if she does....


Kay arrived at four-thirty, grinning about my letter to the
magazine. As my views are based on discussions with her, I
mentioned that I ought to have named her as my adviser. She
said that if I had, she would have had to sue me for libel. Marion

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Kay visited an American friend who was a staff nurse on the
closed ward, and came back feeling homesick. Meanwhile,
Marion had been talking to the staff nurse.


Of course, you immediately assumed that they were discussing
you.


It would be natural. Kay asked me if, by venting my aggression
in letters to the nursing press, I was relieving pent-up pressures,
and said that I seemed very bitter. It is impossible to explain that
I am now very aware of my aggression, and that the bits I express
are like an iceberg -- there is seven-eighths beneath the surface
and only lightly repressed. This disturbs me as I don't know
which direction my aggressiveness will take. If it is self-directed,
as I suppose the window-breaking was, I don't mind so much, but
I fear that I might go for one of the vulture four -- especially Mrs.
Delaney.


All three of us ate out and I noticed that Kay looked depressed,
and of course I blamed myself for this. I talked far too much --
probably because I say so little on the ward?


Even so, occasionally I let rip and invited opinions but none
were given. These X----- hospital nurses never seem to be off-
duty. I considered themso analytically constipated that they
were unable to express an opinion on anything. This lack of communication
annoyed me very much, as I was unwilling to admit
that my effort to bridge the gap between us -- patient and nurses --
was unsuccessful.


When you had temporarily exhausted the subject of the Wilton
Clinic, you tried to talk about Kay's interests, but only succeeded
in embarrassing her.


Well, she is so versatile, and I'd love to be able to emulate her.
She is everything I'm not, the other side of the coin to me. She
has a ballet teacher's diploma; medals for ballroom and Latin
American dancing; she can drive; ice skate; ride; swim over a
mile; work a telephone switchboard; she has worked as a P.R.O.;
a travel courier; she speaks French; she has travelled round the
world; she has been an assistant matron; she knows how to work
in a betting office (of all places); and she can nurse and converse
with anyone. All this I discovered over the three years that I have
known her. I don't know if other American girls are like her but
she's a good advertisement for the country.

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then you swung back to the subject of the hospital and repeated
the conversation between the bus-phobia woman and a
shop-lifter who were talking about hiding tablets. One of them
had been thoroughly searched by a former nurse who had even
searched her powder compact and felt the seams in her clothes.
The shop-lifter snorted about ‘the cheek of it’. She collected
tablets from the hospital (she was a day patient), and then went to
her G.P. who prescribed other medication for her various aches
and pains. The bus-woman lay on her bed and said that she
knew of a good hiding-place, as she had seen some special signet
rings with a secret compartment for one or two tablets. The shoplifter
was impressed, but with a glance at me, advised her neighbour
to keep her discovery quiet, ‘in case everyone buys the
rings’.


The shop-lifter amused me because I had often seen her
wrapping up flowers in newspaper. Jean had explained that the
woman dutifully attended the local C. of E. church and later
pinched the flowers from the altar. These she divided, giving half
to the staff nurse and taking the rest home. This had been going
on for so long that the exasperated vicar had <i>given</i> her the flowers,
but the woman continued to lift others. Being given them wasn't
half so much fun. She had never stolen anything from our
dormitory, but she would ‘borrow’ toilet things.


Marion and Kay laughed with me, and it was a relief to know
that things I considered funny, also amused them. I had had
my doubts about my sense of humour.


I walked back to ward D and saw the refined Mrs. Platitude in
bed. I looked inquiringly at Janet -- a depressed but intelligent
married woman in her forties, who, like me, preferred solitude.
She whispered that Grace had returned from leave tight, and had
to be put to bed. The patient protested that she had had only
one gin four hours before, but she was giggling, her speech was
slurred, and she was unsteady on her feet. Now she seemed to be
asleep.


I went to my bed and tried to read a magazine. I noticed that
a near-by bed had been turned back for a new woman who was
still in the lounge. Jean bounded in and began to patch holes in
a nightdress with a bandage, for she was soon to be discharged,
and didn't want her friends at college to see how she dressed herself
at the hospital.

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Grace climbed out of bed, staggered, and picked her way out
of the dormitory to get her night sedation. Janet put down her
book, I put down my magazine, and Jean looked up impishly.


‘That must have been a mighty big gin,’ Janet said slowly.


Jean's eyebrows climbed. ‘I expect she had a bottleful.’


‘And she didn't bring back any for us,’ I said.


‘Fiendish! Jean exclaimed. ‘But if you can get drunk on
fumes, no doubt we'll all be tight by morning.’


‘Which side does she lie on?’ Janet asked with forced anxiety.


‘We could always get the hair dryer and divert the gases,’ I
put in.


We began to discuss Grace's other worse trait, remarking on the
obvious. We had all suffered. When the woman had seen me
with hair wet and curlers in she had asked if I had washed my
hair. When Jean had her textbooks on the bed she had come up
to ask her if she were studying. When Janet had entered in her
coat, Mrs. Platitude had asked her if she had been out.


‘We will have to rename her,’ Jean observed.


‘You mean about her stating the obvious?’ Janet said.


‘What about Mrs. S.O.?’ I broke in. ‘You can take that how
you like.’


‘Most appropriate,’ Jean said, looking up from her sewing.


The new patient and a few of the other women came into the
dormitory and then Grace, or Mrs. S.O., reeled in and slumped
into bed. Jean looked up mischievously. Janet was eating an
apple.


‘Are you eating an apple?’ Jean asked.


Janet looked puzzled then she entered into the game. ‘No, I'm
chewing a barley sugar.’ She looked at Jean. ‘Are you sewing?’


Jean looked up with mock surprise. ‘How did you guess?’


‘Because you've got a needle and thread,’ I said.


Jean brightened. ‘How clever of you. Are you smoking,
Clare?’


I put down my cigarette, but before I could reply, Mrs. S.O.
said: ‘She must be: she's got a cigarette alight.’


I hid myself behind the magazine and choked with suppressed
laughter, but not before I had seen the expression on the new
patient's face: she must have thought we three were completely
mad. We carried on with the game, trying to cap each other's
absurd remarks, then one of the patients got up and stormed out
to the nurse to complain about our conversation. As her particular

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally Mrs. S.O. fell asleep, and when the lights were dimmed,
we tried to settle down for the night, with laughter still bubbling
inside us.


Innocent fun and games born of boredom.


<i>Monday, 21st September</i>


Woke up with a sense of despairing depression; the remorseful
aftermath of my conduct last night. This morning, Chloë says
that she intends to leave. She is rather vague about the reason,
but says that she doesn't like the nurses or the patients. Mrs.
Delaney, a fellow vulture, immediately said: ‘You-don't-mean-that-Chloë.
You-know-I-like-you.’


Chloë bestowed a dark look. So even the vultures aren't in
harmony, and I thought about my admission to the select Jean/
Janet clique. The other member is a young girl who couldn't
walk when she came in. She is still obsessional, and every time
she walks along the dormitory, she taps each bed. If she weren't
so young, I would scream at her for this. She has been here for
more than a year, which also makes me shudder.


My introduction to the clique began when Jean tentatively
tested my response to a Paddy Roberts record on lavatorial
subjects.


<i>Gentlemen must please refrain<br />
From flushing toilets while the train<br />
Is standing in the station<br />
I love you.<br />
Workmen working underneath<br />
Are apt to get it in the teeth<br />
And they don't like it<br />
Nor would you</i>.


It was blue but true, and I laughed. This seemed to be enough
for my nomination as an associate member. I doubt whether I
will make full membership because I am so slowed up that I can't
produce any subtle retorts. At this time, my humour lies in awful
puns, and obvious jokes. I can't keep up with the speed and deft
touches of the clique. Last night I laughed, but I sensed that they

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The day creaked by. I spent the morning in Lyons writing. I
don't feel the pressure of people's thoughts there, and the background
noise doesn't bother me.


At two o'clock, I was summoned by Dr. Seed to see a senior
registrar on Dr. Marx's firm. I had heard that he was an ‘E.C.T.
specialist’, which did not endear him to me. As usual, I kept my
head down like a good nun. Seed had already asked me if people's
eyes bothered me, and they do. I feel that people can read what
I'm thinking through my eyes, so I look away. This may make
me seem very shifty, but I can only face my close friends from
whom I have very few secrets.


This business is very schizy. I suppose you know that?


It is, but I have it. I would wear dark glasses all the time if I
could -- cloak myself in darkness -- but this would attract attention.
As this symptom has been getting worse, like a blind person I have
come to identify people by their voices. As I am not aware of
facial expressions, which are false, I am learning more about
people's true personalities and feelings by their voices and intonations.
I don't even know what my regular doctor here looks like,
but I know his voice and I have made a study of feet: his are very
large.


Why don't you get back to the interview, Clare?


It followed the usual pattern, Nurse Wallace. Questions and
more questions.


He concentrated on your hallucinations, and dealt with all the
senses except taste, and you came up with a ‘yes’ to all of them,
didn't you, Clare?


Well, I admitted to hearing voices which were not my thoughts,
but I had never seen anything hallucinatory.


Wait a minute. What about the stairs which you said were
moved from place to place, Clare?


Yes, I mentioned that, but I didn't tell him about the things I
have misidentified, for example, something I took to be a
wounded sparrow was, on closer examination, a piece of charred
paper.


Illusions? Very common in schizophrenia, Clare.


Thank you, Nurse Wallace. Then he moved on to the sense of
smell and suggested that some people smelled certain things.


So you told him how you smelled your own self and thought

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He asked you whether you felt you were changing sex: another
schizophrenic manifestation.


I told him that I had known this once when I was at St.
Michael's, but not since.


Then he leaned back and told you that you must have nursed
patients who complained of all these things.


Of course I had, but they imagined them -- I didn't. He worried
his point a little but I was convinced and tried to tell him of
my theories regarding what constituted sanity.


You said that psychiatrists considered that people who deviated
from the path which they happened to follow were candidates
for all kinds of therapy to make them ‘see the light’. Surprisingly
he almost agreed.


He asked you if you considered yourself ill. That stumped you,
Clare, so you repeated your opinion that you were constitutionally
inadequate and that this wasn't an illness.


Then he changed tack and asked me if I thought that my
symptoms were not significant of a nervous breakdown. This I
considered such a stupid term that I had to suppress a derisive
laugh. He changed it for a ‘mental illness’, but I replied that I
didn't think so, and that I couldn't tolerate illness in myself, and
that I was fast heading towards being just like my father -- a
miserable hypochondriac.


He picked up <i>Mink On My Apron</i> and began to question you
about your pen name.


It is odd the way all the psychiatrists pounce on my books and
start the third degree. I can't see how writing is symptomatic of
any one disorder, but they always returned to the subject.


Perhaps they thought you had woven a delusional system
around somebody else's books, and were claiming to be a published
author when in reality you were not.


You mean that I had illusions of grandeur, Clare? Me?


Well, you might have selected this instead of bestowing on
yourself phoney titles: you know, ‘I am the Queen of Sheba’,
which your psychiatric training might have ruled out as being too
much like insanity for you to adopt.

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The question of my training giving me a clinical insight into my
own case has interested a number of people who have talked to
me about it, chiefly Kay, who took the risk of making statements
whereas others merely hinted.


You would seem to be the most appropriate person to deal with
this slant on my ‘indisposition’, Nurse Wallace.


Maybe, but I'm not very objective because we're together in
this, Clare, but I can detach myself a little more than you. For
instance, there is the question of your auditory hallucinations.
Most people describe them as ‘voices’, but you shun this term and
speak about the ‘talking’. It's splitting hairs but you seem to find
it important. You even wince when a doctor mentions ‘voices’ to
you. Then there is your delusion about being followed by detectives
set to watch your movements by your eldest brother who is
in league with a Black Magic group. You never speak of being
‘persecuted’, as this reminds you of your training in the paranoid
illnesses, but it is, in fact, what you feel. You use every circumlocution
you can think of to avoid the word ‘persecution’. And
your ideas of reference -- that every single word or action by
people around you refers to you, you delete the word ‘refer’ and
use ‘relate’ or ‘having a meaning’. All these substitutions of words
or terms seem to be essential to our nurse/self respect. Using the
usual words would be tantamount to admitting that you have a
schizophrenic illness. This denial of the obvious persists in spite
of your declaration in the first chapter that you were schizophrenic.
That was only an intellectual acceptance; the emotional
you hasn't yet accepted it. This ought to show you how much
insight you lack.


But they don't diagnose anyone as schizophrenic at the Wilton
Clinic.


That should please part of you - the part that is fantasy, but
the other splinter of Self that reaches out to connect with
reality knows that the overwhelming opinion amongst other psychiatrists
you have seen is that you are schizophrenic. This is a fact and
you will never forget it unless you wish to go completely mad.


Is it reality?


Of course, but like other real things it is unpalatable to you, so
you seek to repress it as you repressed other hurtful situations in
childhood. You seek complete fantasy and you would probably
be much more content if you <i>could</i> revel in fantasy instead of
being conflict-torn by the pressures of the real world and your

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I suppose you're right.


Shall we leave this excursion from events and return to your
reactions to what was a painful, probing interview?


After you, Nurse.


Unnecessary, I thought. I had the impression that they thought
I should have made a go of suicide ages ago instead of becoming
a useless ‘hospital bird’. I sat in the lounge thinking about the
interview and the unspoken contempt.


Then you began to hear the contemptuous remarks of the other
patients.


Is it so impossible that with electrical impulses like telephone,
radio, and television being transmitted, thought waves cannot be
sent too?


You're stubborn, aren't you, Clare?


I knew I couldn't stand much more of the growing pressure
and I asked the Sister if I could go out. Something of my inner
tension must have been apparent for she asked me when I would
be back and where I was going. I mumbled something and put
on my coat. Her permission was a sign to me that I should go
ahead with my plan.


<i>Your</i> suicidal plan, Clare?


My plan, our plan, what does it matter? It had to be done. I
walked into a chemist's and looked casually at a display of Codeine
tablets. Twenty-five? Not enough. Fifty? Risky. A hundred
then? Yes, that ought to do it but they cost three-and-six. Fool!
You won't have to worry about money when you're in hell. Who
says there's an after life? That's just man's conceit and longing
for immortality. The assistant is waiting. Won't she think it
peculiar if I buy as many as a hundred Codeine? Tell her you're
buying that amount to save money. It sounds suspicious. Rubbish!
She's afraid. Look at her! She's scared....


I bought the Codeine and tried to walk casually from the shop.
The assistant made no comment about my purchase. Now what?
I glanced around at the five-o'clock crowds and began to walk. I
didn't know where I was making for.


You hoped for divine guidance, Clare?

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Fiendish guidance would be more likely. I came to a café,and
patting my bag to make sure that the tablets were out of sight, I
went in and wedged myself in at a corner table. A waiter
appeared. Was he staring? No. Yes. Hell, everyone stares at
you. They know what you want to do. Do I want to kill myself?
You may not but everyone thinks you should, so be guided by the
majority vote. I don't know.


‘Yes, Madam?’


He sounded faintly irritated. What did I want anyway? A
cup of tea. No, that won't be enough to wash down a hundred
large tablets.


‘A pot of tea, please.’


‘Only cups of tea, Madam.’


He <i>was</i> bored, irritated, and he was staring. Stop dithering for
God's sake.


‘Well, a cup of tea, please.’


Perhaps I could swallow enough Codeine with one cup of tea.
But when the tea came I knew that the cup was too small, and a
man had taken the table opposite and he, too, was staring. No
good. No good. This place was too public. I drank some of the
tea, paid the waiter, and walked out. Where could I go now?


I walked slowly along the road, almost bumping into people.
What did they matter? The talking was now in a courtroom
setting and I was standing in the dock listening to the opposing
counsels arguing before the judge. My judge was the devil, and
he interrupted to give his views.


‘We see this wretched woman on trial, accused of a life of evil
and self-indulgence. I demand death by suicide.’


‘I second that.’


‘This is neither the time nor place for levity.’


‘Master, it was unintentional.’


‘She might repent, m'lud.’


Laughter from the public benches. A gavel is tapped.


‘I shall clear the court if there are any further interruptions.
You, the accused. Have you anything to say?’


Say? What can I say?


‘She has no defence. She admits her guilt!’


‘Perhaps she might change?’


‘Excuses but no reasons.’


The black cap and eyes everywhere. ‘Clare Marc Wallace.
You have been found guilty of wilful evil and I claim you for my

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The decision had been made for me, but where and how could
I take a hundred tablets? If I took them on the ward that would
be unfair to Sister Zukov. That meant that I must take them here
somehow. I was nearing a cinema. Darkness. I could take them
in there. I would have at least six hours before anyone suspected
that I was not just asleep. That should be long enough. I bought
a cheap ticket out of habit and walked into the darkness. I was
being shown to my seat when I remembered that I hadn't got
anything to drink. No liquid -- no tablets.


I retraced my steps and bought a carton of lemonade in the
foyer, and went back into the dark. I selected a seat where there
was only one person sitting in the same row. I pretended to look
at the screen, then when I found myself concentrating on the film,
I cursed myself and tried to think about taking the tablets.


I opened my bag and eased out the bottle. Automatically I
checked the label. Then it occurred to me that the cinema
couldn't be that dark, and if I could see the label then people
could see what I was doing. I deliberated over the situation, but
the film was having an hypnotic effect on me. It wasn't the plot,
or the technique: it was just another interruption amongst the
discordant choirs of voices. I sat there for over an hour trying to
make a decision. I wanted to ask someone's advice on how-to-
succeed-in-suicide-without-really-trying.


At last I got up, slipped the bottle into my pocket, and grasping
the carton of lemonade, I went into the toilet. Good. There were
two compartments, so if one should be locked nobody would
investigate. I might have until morning. Now, the tablets, and
now get the lemonade carton open. I took an experimental sip
with a slightly bent straw. I held the Codeine bottle up to the
light. A hundred tablets. I would never get them all down with
just this drink, and it had to be a hundred. It was a round figure
and a sound one. No hysterical gestures with fewer tablets. That
would be the final humiliation: to be found in a locked toilet not
dead, but only drowsy.


I took another sip of lemonade and lit a cigarette. These
wretched tablets were presenting nothing but problems. My
mouth was dry from anxiety and, without more to drink, I would
never get the Codeine down. I thought about going back to the
foyer for more lemonade, but I had nowhere to hide the first

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hell and damnation! It wasn't fair that things should be so
difficult. I had a good mind to forget about it. But I couldn't
forget the bottle.


‘Clare Marc Wallace. You have been found guilty....’ The
devil was in a curious mood. I could have sworn that he was
laughing.


Guilty, yes. I must atone for everything. Stop dithering and
do something. What? How? Damn it all. I put the bottle into
my pocket again and sucked on the straw. When the carton was
empty I dropped it on the floor and unlocked the door. I went
out by the fire exit so that I wouldn't have to make that walk up
the aisles of the cinema.


Outside it was dark. My watch showed seven-twenty. I must
have been in that bog for half an hour. What a lovely way to
spend an evening, tra la. Oh, you're so bloody clever, aren't you?
A doubly-trained nurse, and you can't even swallow a bottle of
tablets. Give yourself a pat on the back -- with a knife.


I began to walk, and transferred the Codeine to my bag. I was
beginning to realize that my suicidal bid was a flop. Not tonight,
Josephine. God knows when, but not tonight. My self-loathing
made me squirm. Was this just part of the punishment? They
had it down to a fine art: they extended my indecision and paralysed
my power of action, but allowed my mind to pick up all the
thoughts and all the talking that was going on.


This road was familiar. Oh yes, it led to the hospital. I had to
be in by eight. How on earth can I face them after this? Here
was The Star -- a terrible pub, but a pub after all. I went in the
saloon bar and almost backed out again. The bar was lined by men
only, and the place looked like a funeral parlour in days of old. I
wanted a drink -- badly. I would have to put up with the surroundings
and the inquisitive men at the bar. Perhaps I could
take the Codeine here, but no, the opportunity was past. I could
take refuge in booze -- glorious booze. I had a whisky and lime.
It was the first spirits I'd had for months, and it tasted sharp and
unpleasant, but I'd paid for it so I drank it. Within a few minutes
I began to unwind. I hated using alcohol, but it was effective,
and my self-esteem stopped plummeting to the depths, began to
rise, and I thumbed my nose at the devil.


Feeling bold, I stood up and ordered another drink. It tasted

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697838-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I walked out of the morgue-like pub and made my way to the
Clinic. I might just be in time to get in. I was. A Jamaican
assistant was about to close the door when I reached the ward.
The bottle. What about the bottle? Hell, I had to do something
with it. I couldn't put it anywhere where it would be a temptation
for others. The nurse stepped in again. I walked into the office
and pushed the bottle at Sister. She followed me out into the
passage. ‘Thank you, Miss Wallace. I hope you haven't taken
any. Attention-seeking. Yes. Yes. Have a cup of tea, Miss
Wallace. Take a pint of milk, yes?’


Attention-seeking? I might have known I'd get that, but handing
in bottles of tablets was a little too obvious even for me. It was
laughable. First I step in front of a bus and it misses me, now I
buy some Codeine and don't know how to take them.


I went to bed in disgust, saved for another day.
