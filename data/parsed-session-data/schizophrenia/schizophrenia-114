<b>PT:</b> And that blue house right over [INAUDIBLE] —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> All the way.  I was turning left [INAUDIBLE] and the driver runs the red and hit the side of the car at like 40 miles per hour.
<b>DR:</b> Your side?
<b>PT:</b> No, her side.  Um, and it, we were turning like this and so it was almost head on.  She didn't even remember looking at me, but she looked at me and was like, "Oh my God, he's not going to stop," and she got, it was an '09 Mercedes rental from the dealership, and he like, the whole backseat of the car is like inside the car now.  And so, we were able to crawl out of my side of the car because I was in the passenger's side.  He wasn't drunk, he just ran that red like it was his job, and, um, so they [INAUDIBLE], um, and they did a couple of CT scans on my back, and so I've got screws.  They've never done a full CT of my back because it's like $10,000.00.  In case you didn't know, that's how much it is to do your whole back.  I've got screws at T6, T7 and T8 that are, um, a millimeter and a half away from the canal and then I've got screws at L2 that's actually inside of the canal.  So, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I saw, he's an orthopedic surgeon, the ER doctors are like, okay, you can go, but, um, come back if you feel, if you start getting sick, like to your stomach, or if anything weird happens, come back.  Well, I mean I called [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and he was like, okay, we'll see you Friday.  That's the earliest, because he's in surgery like Wednesdays and Thursdays.  Um, so I saw him Friday.  On Thursday morning, early, early, I got really, really sick.  I got some kind of virus from someone, some kind of stomach virus, but, um, I called the pediatrician and they're like, all right, well you have to come in because you were in a car accident.  So, I came in, but she was like, it's just a virus because I was sick from every bit of my body, it was horrible.  I thought I was going to die.  And, FYI, my mom and dad did not come to the hospital when I got hit by the car that night.  They weren't there.  They knew it happened.  They didn't come.  And then Thursday —
<b>DR:</b> How'd they know?
<b>PT:</b> I called them to tell them because I didn't know, like, how bad it was until I got to the hospital.  If it had been really bad, they would have had, I mean, they would have had to have come, but I mean they didn't come, but it was like, you know, they have to go to work in the morning, whatever.  [NAME OTHER] came.  She's my medical power of attorney.  What [AGE] has a medical power of attorney?  Me, because my parents are like, they don't care enough to know enough to learn enough to be responsible that if I'm incapacitated and my mom, sometimes she'll got to [INAUDIBLE] meetings, she'll come back and she'll be like, there was a woman today that did electro shock therapy and she seemed much better.  And I looked at her and I was like, "No, no.  See, that's why you're not in charge of like making any decisions."  If I was like in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I don't even know if they do it at [DEIDENTIFIED], but my mom can't, you know what I mean, like I just don't want her to have that ability, that power, so she's not in charge at all.  She also like was browsing through my health insurance information, so I called Blue Cross Blue Shield and everything is mailed to me now.  But, it's fine, it's better that way for me to be able to control, like what she does know about me.  But I saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] on Friday, and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was like, "All right, well, you need to meet with, with [DEIDENTIFIED] and talk with them."  So, I got all my medical records together, which apparently, I got like a crate full of x—rays.  I didn't really realize how many x—rays I've had, but every time I see the orthopedic surgeon, and I used to go every month when they were like marking the curve because it was growing, I would get at least three done, the back view and then two lateral views.  And then, sometimes they would like lay you on the table and like bend me and then do x—rays that way, so I've got tons.  Well, they converted them all to like DVD or something, electronically, and they're shipping them out to [DEIDENTIFIED] like this week.  Then once that happens, I'll meet with the neurology guy and orthopedic surgery guy because it's like, it's like a dual problem.  But, they're really good.  I called the [DEIDENTIFIED] people on the phone and they're like, are very helpful.  They're very, very helpful, a very organized medical system, not at all like [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> When are you going up there?
<b>PT:</b> In like three weeks.  So, because [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], only removed, he wants to remove all the hardware.  That's what, that's the thing.  He wants to take it all out.  Well, he's only ever done that in his entire, you know, career as a physician, as a surgeon, he's only done that 20 times.  And one woman, so 1 in 20, that's not good odds.  He had to go back and refuse her.  The same surgery I had in 2003, the big one.  That like nine day one.  I'm not doing that again.  And because they're actually in my canal, I just, I want the best.  I don't want like, and I love [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  He knows I love him.  He's a great guy.  He's a great surgeon.  I just, I mean —
<b>DR:</b> So what, this car accident had an effect?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  He can't say, that's why he wants me to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] too.  He was like if they can, like at [DEIDENTIFIED], if they definitely say that, apparently they've got different machines up there.  They've got special MRI machines that like, I was like, I've got my spine, and he was like, "No, I heard that they've got some kind of new MRI machine and they have some kind of different kind of CT scan," so they can do some kind of other scans to figure out, to help them from the insurance standpoint of saying whether or not this was caused by the accident or not.  Because now I've got a ton of more back pain and I've always had it like up like the upper back area.  Now it's like in my lumbar spine too, which is just really crappy.  But, um, I'm going to meet with the lawyer this week because, I mean, hopefully it won't have to go to court, but like, it's totally this guys fault, and I've got over $15,000.00 in medical bills like, as of today.  And then once I go to [DEIDENTIFIED], then it will probably double with the diagnostic stuff that they do up there.  But, it could have been way worse.
<b>DR:</b> So, don't be in a hurry to settle.
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm not.  I'm not because I'm going to wait until, I'm going to wait until I talk to [DEIDENTIFIED], to the people at [DEIDENTIFIED] because they're the ones that are going to be able to know the most.  Before I, yeah, I'm not signing anything.  But, it's crazy the insurance company is like, I've never been in any kind of accident.  I've never even had so much as a traffic ticket or a parking ticket, and now when I'm in the car, I scream.  Like, I'm the most patient driver.  I sit at lights, like waiting, I'll wait my dandy turn.  I'm like, "Please don't hit me."  We were on [DEIDENTIFIED] yesterday and, and so many roads like go down that hill at the very bottom of the stadium, and my friend [NAME OTHER] was driving and she almost ran a red light.  She was just talking, not paying attention and I was like, [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], stop.  So she stopped.  Well, then we're waiting at the light and this other guy almost barrels through a red light.  I'm just screaming.  Just like totally, like jittery.  It's supposed to get better.  I mean, it really could of, it could have been very worse, so we were lucky.
<b>DR:</b> And they do have CT scans that are much more detailed.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> They look like, they look like anatomy books.
<b>PT:</b> Really?
<b>DR:</b> The MRIs, I'm not aware of any that you could be in.  I would be very cautious about being near an MRI.
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't know, yeah, I was like, um, I just picture, there was like an episode of House where this guy gets an MRI machine and he had like a tatoo that he got in prison that had some metal stuff.  And I'm thinking yeah, okay, I've got like four pounds of titanium, how's that going to work?  Like, are they going to lift them out of my back?  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> No, you [INAUDIBLE] do it at all.
<b>PT:</b> No, yeah.  I don't, yeah, so I don't know.  But, I'll go up there.  And then my mom is like, "Oh, I'm coming with you."  I was like, "No, no."  I was like, "A, we don't ride well in the car together."  Four hours in the car, we would kill each other.
<b>DR:</b> So you've talked to her about all this?
<b>PT:</b> Well no, I let her know.  She's like, "When is the appointment?"  And I was like, um, "They're supposed to call me on Wednesday and the time," and I was like, "Don't worry about it.  It is okay.  I will let you know."  She's like, "Well, we're not going to pay for a surgery if we're not allowed to be involved."  I was like, "You don't get to select, we're just not going to talk about this."  I just kind of left.  I was like, I told my dad, I was like, "You don't get to selectively pick where it's convenient to you when you would like to care enough to be involved."  I was like, "That's not the way this works."  So, I mean, I'm not worried about it.  And I have all this back pain, so before I got hit by the car, I was going to go to either [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] to talk to them about like a pain pump or like a neuro stimulator thing, an electrode thing.  Well now, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], was like, "You know, the majority of my patients that I take these surgeries out, these screws out," which I'm thinking "You've only done 20."  He's like, "They have great pain relief."  But, in everything I've ever done, I'm always at like 5% that has like the bad outcome, like the margin of error, like, you know, so I'm just a little skeptical, it's like a seven day hospital stay.
<b>DR:</b> You've got time; you'll get some more information.
<b>PT:</b> So, we're doing that, and so I stopped having like the hallucinations and stuff for a bit, but they've come back and I think that what's triggering them is being really, really tired.  Like, I had one last night.  I was exhausted yesterday from before, and last night my friend [NAME OTHER] called me and she had just gotten broken up by her boyfriend, so [NAME OTHER] and it was like my couple brother's friends were there, it's like 11:00 and what people tell me, I kind of, I can kind of realize when it's about to start.  And, but I can't really remember what I say or what I do.  I've had them when I'm driving, which is the scariest.  I was driving back from [DEIDENTIFIED], my friend [NAME OTHER]'s parents' house and I remember going to [DEIDENTIFIED].  I was on [DEIDENTIFIED].  I remember passing the Blue Cross, Blue Shield building on [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED], then I got on [DEIDENTIFIED] and I'm on the phone actually because I feel tired.  I'm notorious for falling asleep while driving.  I've done that every since I started to drive to [DEIDENTIFIED], I can't make it more than two hours in the car by myself.  I can have, like 14 hours of sleep before that.  It doesn't matter.  It just kind of lulls me to sleep.  And, um, I like, was on the phone with her.  She was like, "You started talking about how there's this big old green house in front of you."  She was like, "But then you were like, no, it's okay.  It's just a big old green tree."  That's 11:00 at night we were talking about this.  There's no green house on [DEIDENTIFIED] heading towards [DEIDENTIFIED].  There's just not.  There's no green house, green tree.  I'll kind of, I'll talk about stuff or it's just, it's really weird and so now I'm hysterical anymore, but could the Lamictal be doing it?  Because I'm not taking Percocet when these are happening.  I've gone through ever drug that I've been on and try and figure out like, because I'm not on the ketoconazole anymore.  I'm not on any antibiotics.  I take a Xanax like PRN, but definitely not every day, and I take a Percocet PRN, but I try not to take that at all if I don't have to on a day to day basis.  I probably take like four a week.  And then, I'm on the Lamictal and birth control and a multivitamin.  That's it, and Cymbalta, but like, where, it's scary.  And I don't know if I'm not sleeping really well at night and maybe that is what's making me so tired later.  But like —
<b>DR:</b> When do, when do these occur besides when you're driving?
<b>PT:</b> I've had them in the middle of the day.  I've, I, I remember one I had, it was really bad, was at [NAME OTHER]'s house when I was babysitting and that was at Easter, so it was right before Easter because we were dying Easter eggs and [NAME OTHER], the [AGE], her mom was there while I was babysitting, just like cleaning and stuff.  She just needed me to distract [NAME OTHER] and she was like, [PATIENT NAME] listen, can I take [INAUDIBLE] the dye water in the little thing, she's like, can I take it and put it in the sink and I looked at her and said something to the effect of like, "You're not old enough to drive."  Just saying things that don't have anything to do with the conversation at hand.  So, I don't, I don't know, and I go to sleep well at night.  I don't have to take anything to sleep anymore.
<b>DR:</b> You feel like your mind is drifting off someplace else?
<b>PT:</b> It comes on suddenly.  Like, like when I left [NAME OTHER]'s, it's a 20 minute drive to [DEIDENTIFIED] to my house, to my apartment, and I was wide awake when I left her house, and in the car, I don't know if it's, it happens more at night, but it's not happening solely at night.  And more when I'm tired, but not solely when I'm tired.  The tiredness, I think, triggers them, but I don't know if it's a cause.  Are you supposed to hallucinate when you're tired like that?
<b>DR:</b> Well, if you're falling asleep —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but, I'm not falling asleep at the wheel.  When I fall asleep at the wheel, it's usually, I us, I try not to drive at night.  I try not to drive longer than 30 minutes at night ever.
<b>DR:</b> Because of that?
<b>PT:</b> Because I can fall asleep at the wheel.  I mean, it was so bad, [DEIDENTIFIED], I can do in an hour and 45 because I did it twice a week for like two years, and I would have to get like new comedy, like comedy every week and upload it on my iPod —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And that was different than music.  Music would put me to sleep, but comedy kind of like kept my mind going and kept me awake, or I'd have to actually be talking to somebody on the phone.  When I drove to [DEIDENTIFIED] last February, not of '09, but of '08, um, it got dark and we were driving, I was wide awake and everybody is in the back seat watching a movie [INAUDIBLE] my dad's car watching a movie, and we're on these tiny little curvy roads and I finally pulled over at a gas station and was like, "Somebody needs to get up in the front with me and talk to me or we will fall off of the side of this mountain.  I will drive the car off the edge because I'm going to pass out at the wheel."  I don't know why.  I have friends who love to drive.  They can drive for 10 hours straight and [INAUDIBLE] more than two hours, ever.  I don't know what it is, it's kind of like, and I know it's not from the wreck because this was happening long before that.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  I mean, as you drift off to sleep, you have that hypnagogic kind of stuff with hallucinations and —
<b>PT:</b> But, it's happened, it happens in the day time too sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> Confusion.  But it's when you're drifting off?
<b>PT:</b> No, we were dying Easter eggs.  We were, it happened when I've been at like the library, like, you know, like day to day, and I've tried to pin down like did I eat something, did I, was I on some kind of different medicine then?  Was I super duper tired, but I mean, I never get less than six hours and I try to get eight.  Probably five nights out of the week, I get around eight hours just to get well rested.  I have really long days, so I try to, I need eight hours, anywhere between six to eight.  I'm usually like ready to go, like I wake up fine in the morning and I go to sleep fine.  I used to have so much trouble going to sleep.  I don't have that anymore.
<b>DR:</b> So you were dying these Easter eggs and then your, start —
<b>PT:</b> We're sitting, we're sitting at her kitchen table in the kitchen, her mom is like 15 feet away, like straightening up in the den, and we're dying Easter eggs and I start to feel like zoned out.  It's, and [NAME OTHER] told, [NAME OTHER] is the mom, [NAME OTHER]'s the [AGE], [NAME OTHER] said that I just, like I was just, what do they call it when, um, when you're staring off, she's like, "It was like you were just staring off but you were still talking."  She was like, "But you would talk, but nothing you said made any sense."  Like—
<b>DR:</b> Do you remember it?
<b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.
<b>DR:</b> That sounds more like seizure.
<b>PT:</b> And then, if I can get up and kind of walk around right after, it kind of will, like, knock me out of it.  Like last night, I was, I was very tired and I was sitting at the couch, [NAME OTHER] was sitting next to me, [NAME OTHER] was sitting across from me, and they were talking about something and I was just listening and I was tired.  Then I started talking about like just, like nonsense, just stuff that has nothing to do with the conversation.  And [NAME OTHER] looked at me and she was like, "We've got to get you home.  Yeah, we've got to get you home."  So, we went home, I went to bed and woke up fine this morning at 8:00 AM, you know, like I don't —
<b>DR:</b> But you don't remember what you said?
<b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.
<b>DR:</b> They told you.
<b>PT:</b> Other people will tell me.  They'll tell me, but I don't remember saying it.  I don't, like, and the stuff I say, I don't know here the hell it's coming from because it doesn't make any sense.
<b>DR:</b> It's just a bunch of [INAUDIBLE] words?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, and it's, it leaves me feeling confused, almost embarrassed.  That's how I felt last night because they were all talking about like very serious topics and [NAME OTHER] had just got broken up with on the [INAUDIBLE] so she's all distraught, and I'll say things that have nothing to do with the conversation at hand.  So now everybody looks at me like, "What the hell did you say?"  Because there's no way that you could even tie it to something else.  You know, some people will just talk on a tangent, no, like it's totally unrelated.  It would be like if you were talking about animals at the zoo, and I started talking about like, I don't know, Hawaii, like just completely not related thoughts.  I don't know, I've done it around my mom before, it's freaked her out.
<b>DR:</b> Have you had EEGs done before?  Have you ever had one?
<b>PT:</b> I've had E, I mean, I've had a ton of EKGs.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> But not EEGs.
<b>DR:</b> You might want to do that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I just, because it got better when I went of the Seroquel, I was fine for a couple weeks, but they come back, like, I don't know if I done, uh, if maybe I was getting more sleep then than now, but I mean, for the majority of the summer, five days a week, I'm up by 6:30 or 7:00 and I'm at work by 8:30 or 9:00.  So, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] do that.  What are you doing this sum, are you working, how much now?
<b>PT:</b> I'm babysitting.
<b>DR:</b> How much?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, some weeks, well, I did two weeks of 40 hours, which was, whew —
<b>DR:</b> A lot.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know how she does it; she's a stay at home mom.  I don't know how she does it, but, um, right not it's usually around like 15 and then I do this stuff at the church, and then I'll do 15, like minimum a week for [NAME OTHER], and then I'll do random babysitting, and you know, like Friday, Saturday night kind of stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Have you done a budget yet to see how much money you're going to need?
<b>PT:</b> For the year?
<b>DR:</b> I mean, is this enough money you're making?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, for right now, and then [NAME OTHER]'s dad is, um, the [DEIDENTIFIED], and he does stuff through the, um, med school here at [DEIDENTIFIED] too so he, um, he can get me a job for the fall he said.  It's like a research position.  And [NAME OTHER] is doing it right now and she gets paid like $11.50 an hour.  She was like, "Essentially, I just Facebook all day."  I was like, "No, I can't do that.  That would drive me crazy."  I cannot like just sit at a desk.  I need to be up doing stuff.  But they said that in the fall, I can't remember which professor it is, he's doing stuff with the gross anatomy lab, which would be so cool.  That would be so cool to work at the gross anatomy lab at [DEIDENTIFIED], or [DEIDENTIFIED], whatever it is, the acronym.  The med school here.  The one not in [DEIDENTIFIED].  But, um —
<b>DR:</b> Is that who you work with?
<b>PT:</b> Who, [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> Who do you work with in —
<b>PT:</b> Oh —
<b>DR:</b> Anatomy?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, well, her dad's last name is [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], but her name is [NAME OTHER].  And I don't know the name of the guy who's in charge of the [INAUDIBLE], like his, um, it's on his dissertation [INAUDIBLE] for forever.  Um, I'll find out his name though.  They're having a cook out on Saturday night, like her dad and her mom, they're Egyptian and then all of his friends, in fact, they were faculty at [DEIDENTIFIED] and stuff, so that will be interesting to go to.
<b>DR:</b> Are you going to go?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, we'll all be there.
<b>DR:</b> That will be fun for you.
<b>PT:</b> I'll probably go, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, what have you heard from school, anything?
<b>PT:</b> I applied for merit, and, um, [NAME OTHER]'s mom is a full time instructor, RN teacher at [DEIDENTIFIED], so she said that, unofficially, the merit cut off is like late, I mean, high 20s, low 30s, is like as low as they'll take, and I think my score was like 30, so hopefully I'll get in for merit.  I'll find out in like a couple weeks, they'll mail letters out and that could start in January, which would be amazing.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> If not, and I'm still applying in October, and then hope that I start in like May.  Right now my start date is August.
<b>DR:</b> What are you doing this fall?
<b>PT:</b> I get advised at [DEIDENTIFIED] on Thursday.  I've been advised at [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't have to take 9 hours worth of classes so I won't have to start paying back my student loan, but I'm not going to take 15 hours with this bullshit because nursing, apparently, kind of, you know even pharmacy now, nursing is like the only college in [DEIDENTIFIED] where every course that you take is very individualized to that college.  Like, I can't transfer my nursing courses to psychology or to sociology, or to biology even.  Even though a lot of the stuff is still the same, it's under a nursing prefix, so it doesn't transfer for accreditation purposes.  So like, why am I going to spend $30,000.00 taking a ton of psychology or sociology classes that are going to earn me sociology or psychology degree that I will never use?  It doesn't make any sense.  So, I'm going to take a bare minimum at the cheapest place.  So, you know, whatever.  I'm swimming at the [DEIDENTIFIED] and that's good.  Me and [NAME OTHER] are swimming a couple days a week, just trying to like, be active.  It is blazing hot outside though.
<b>DR:</b> How's your health been?
<b>PT:</b> Good otherwise.  Other than that car wreck.
<b>DR:</b> That's awful.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think it, it, it's, the guy, he was driving a 1990 Jeep, like a '98 or something.  The whole front of his Jeep just fell off on the ground and gas started pouring out.  I scampered my ass out of that car like it was my job, like we opened, my window was down, and we opened it from the outside and then got out and just sat on the curb.  The EMT, okay, she's an EMT basic, which is essentially means you're qualified to do just about nothing and they take us in to [DEIDENTIFIED] and you know, they put you in a hallway because they were like, "All right, CT scan."  So, we're in the hallway waiting on the CT machine and I hear, [INAUDIBLE], have you ever been in the collar thing?
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> You can't, can't, it's a horrible feeling.  Try to avoid it.  Because you're laying there and you're still strapped in and you can't see anything but what's directly above you.  And I can hear the woman talking crap about me and [NAME OTHER] to the nurse.  The EMT that brought us in.  Not the paramedic, the EMT, the one driving the car, she's like, "Those girls are totally fine, they were sitting on the side of the road, sitting up, they weren't bleeding, you know, they were able to make phone calls to their parents," and then the doctor came back and was like all right, let's take you to CT.  Well, I found out her name and I filed a complaint with her boss.  I'm sorry.
<b>DR:</b> Why did they put C collars on you if you were fine?
<b>PT:</b> Exactly, exactly.  Since when does she have x—ray vision because the last time I checked, she didn't have four pounds of titanium screwed into her spine; the last time I checked.  So, I'm sorry, as a nurse, I'm not going to be talking crap about people.  And nurses gossip like all get out.  Like they're the worst.  They're the absolute worse.  I used to volunteer at the hospital, I know, but really, when the chick that you brought in was like 20 yards away, I can hear you.  I'm on a stretcher.  Hello, hello.  But other than that, it went really good.  The nurse blew the IV in my arm.  I think I scared her because I watched her put it in which apparently freaked her out and made her nervous.  I had a bruise this big for a week and a half.  She blew the whole vein.  She was like, "Most people don't, you know, actually know which veins are good," and I was like, "Most people haven't had four surgeries.  Go to my left arm please," and it was totally fine.  I looked like somebody beat me.
<b>DR:</b> Wouldn't listen to you?
<b>PT:</b> Huh—uh, but I mean, they were good other than that.  That's [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Thank God you weren't hurt any worse.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Me too.
<b>DR:</b> Well, let's, uh, let's get an EEG sent [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Well, like, do I just go to, what do I do?  Do I just do that like a PT kind of script where I take a prescription or do you call and set it up?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You can call.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Just take this note with you.  What you do is just call whatever hospital you want to get it at.  [DEIDENTIFIED] is pretty easy.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Just call the EG department and tell them you need one and they'll tell you a time to come in and —
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> If it's petite mal, that's pretty, um, diagnostic in EEG.  It's pretty easy to pick up.
<b>PT:</b> That's just the, little, all over, right?
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  It just messes up your hair.
