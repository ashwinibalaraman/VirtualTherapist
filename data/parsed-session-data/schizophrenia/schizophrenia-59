A friend of mine ran away last night. Right into the arms
of Morpheus, I hope, instead of the gendarmes! We're
planning to meet--eventually--far, far from this maddening
crowd.


"‘Rehabilitation’ they call this," I murmured as we lay
together on the floor of a storage room in the Rehab Center
of Estrelita.


"You know what happens to us if we get caught."


"We get our Red Cards taken away."


"Worse than that," he said, "we'll be here forever."


I raised myself up on one elbow to listen. The door was
not locked--just shut, without even a latch to hold it. And
anyone might at any time be walking down this corridor
that led from the large Rehab hall to the patients' library.


"Come down to me," he pleaded--and I did, knowing
that anything I could give this lad in his battle for freedom
would be welcome. He was so young--barely nineteen--
and so brilliant! Who would ever think of him as a mental
patient? No one, I told myself.

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697839-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was the brilliance that had first attracted me--on the
day, about a week previous, when he had quoted a poem in
our TV studio class. It was cynical and bitter--something
about "Peace" that told the world's whole shameful story
in a few succinct lines.


"Who said that?" I had asked.


"<i>I</i> did," said John--and I knew right then that here was
something for <i>me</i>. There are so few men who attract me--
even in the <i>out</i>side world, and. here at Estrelita I had met
only lumps of clay who could dance or talk--or who
couldn't. Nothing really exciting.


The first time we talked was the following Saturday night
at the dance in the auditorium--with a Negro's choice of
dance records blaring sultry music from the stage. I had
asked him twice to dance with me: once when my usual
Saturday-night partner danced me past him as he sat on
the sidelines, looking fresh and young in his bright red
sweater. I was so glad to see him there--after a day of wishing
I'd spoken to him more at the studio and said something
about seeing him at the dance Saturday night. In
fact, I'd run all the way back to the library just before closing
time on Friday afternoon--then hesitated to go into the
TV Department because I didn't <i>really</i> have any good excuse
to see him. So instead--tongue-tied as a schoolgirl--I
took my book and went back to the dorm. And him young
enough to be my son!


But here he was tonight--and alone! "Save a dance for
me!" I begged.


"Okay." He smiled. "I hear you're the offstage voice on
the show I'm to emcee next week."


"That's right." I had meant to tell him myself. It was
one of the things I'd left unsaid in the studio.


I reminded him again when we met him outside in the
crowd where smokers and nonsmokers gather for a breath
of fresh air--between the high, tightly locked wooden fence

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697839-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I won't," he promised, and my partner looked annoyed
--as if <i>this</i> was the reason I'd suggested we come outside. It
was.


John finally cut in--the first time I'd seen him dancing
all evening. "I was hoping it'd be a slow one," he said.


He was tall--about six feet two. "Would you rather I was
taller?" I asked. "I have some heels in a bag in the corner."
I was dancing in my flats, after standing the high-heeled
shoes as long as I could. I spoke breathlessly--like a teenager
at her first prom--but he didn't answer. I tried another
tack: "I'm so glad you came tonight."


"Why?"


"Because I wanted to dance with you."


"Why?"


"Because you're brilliant--and tall, handsome, attractive...
But mostly because you're brilliant. I find so few
men I have to look up to--frankly."


In TV class the day before we'd had a psychological discussion
on "Love," and John had echoed the director's
statement that he didn't believe either in God or in love.
I asked him about it now, and he explained:


"I said--according to <i>his</i> statement it doesn't exist...
and therefore I'm here."


"According to <i>his</i> definition, even <i>mother</i> love is a selfish
thing," I pointed out. "But the girl who sat next to me in
that class had the only logical answer. She said: ‘We all
<i>need</i> love. So why is it so selfish to expect to get it when
we give it?’ And that's the answer: We <i>give</i> love because we
<i>need</i> love."


The music had changed to a twist, and we went into the
rhythm, John twisting downward until he was almost sitting
on the floor. I tried to follow suit, but my older bones
could go only halfway.

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697839-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Let's sit it out," he suggested. "I'm no jitterbug."


So we sat and talked for the rest of the evening, and for
the first time I noticed the hatchmarks on his arms. One
gets used to hatchmarks at Estrelita, but these were wide
scars, obviously new and very deep.


"I cut the veins," he admitted. "Every time my heart
pumped, the blood spurted." He seemed proud, but I knew
this was just a cover-up for his inner feelings.


"That's stupid!" I exclaimed angrily. "Don't you ever
<i>ever</i> do that again."


"I was lonely," he admitted, "and depressed. I slit my
wrists--then drank a couple of bottles of Dyanshine. That's
deadly poison, you know."


"What color?"


"Black. Then I drove down the wrong side of the Los
Angeles Freeway--with the blood spurting. It was a mess!
Cracked up. And all that happened to me was to get
dragged in here!"


"The God you don't believe in didn't want you to go."


"My time just wasn't up."


"Have you dipped into the book I gave you?" I'd taken
him my copy of a religious book the day before in television
class. It was to replace this that I'd gone back to the
library.


"Yes!" he scoffed. "I've dipped into it. ‘God is love.’
Hah!"


"He is. Keep on reading. You might learn something."


"Okay," he agreed.


"What do you do for a living? Write?" Then I thought:
"He's probably still in college."


"Skin diving. I'm an underwater photographer."


"That should be a dangerous--and frightening--way to
work." He looked away. "But fascinating. I've seen some
marvelous underwater films. Did you see one in which two

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697839-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"That was ‘Beneath the Ten-Mile Reef.’" His eyes lit
up. "I made one called ‘Eight Fathoms’--in the Bahamas."


"Maybe you'll get screen credit," I suggested, and again
he smiled. Just then the clock struck ten, and--like Cinderella
--I had to leave the ball. He put my coat around my
shoulders, and I was glad that--though I'd gotten it at the
Hut, where used clothing is doled out to needy patients--it
looked good. Glad I'd shortened it and made two buttonholes
and remodeled the collar to bring it up to date.


I might have said something more to him--but just then
a boy fell on the floor in an epileptic fit. It happened every
now and then at these dances, and it reminded me too
vividly of the long years when one of my sisters had been
troubled by this malady: the heart-searing screech in the
night... the thrashing body, the feeling of thrusting a
washcloth between her teeth, so she wouldn't bite her
tongue. The time--in high school--when she had an attack
at the top of a flight of stairs... and went down the entire
flight on her face...!


With all this to remember, it's no wonder I couldn't say
good-night to John properly--when viewing a man writhing
on the floor. In fact, he had spoken jokingly of epileptics
earlier in the evening, and now I could only say: "There
is one. There is one!"--and walk tensely toward the door.


I've often thought since how easily misunderstandings
can occur--particularly when there are deep-seated problems
on both sides. But John was still communicating with
me on Monday morning. "I'm still reading your book," he
said. "But--if it's true--why are you here?"


"That's a good question," I agreed. It was. "I think it's

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697839-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"It's sort of like that case of the epileptic boy in the Bible.
Remember?"


"No, I don't."


"Well, Jesus' disciples were unable to heal him--though
Jesus healed him instantly. And when they came to him
afterward and asked him why <i>they</i> couldn't do it, he said:
‘Because of your unbelief. If you have faith as a grain of
mustard seed, you shall be able to move mountains. <i>Nothing</i>
shall be impossible unto you. However, <i>this</i> kind goeth
not out save by prayer and fasting.’ So they just weren't
<i>advanced</i> enough to help him."


"Or you."


"Or me--though <i>I</i> once healed a case of mental illness.
But when you yourself are the one who's ill, it's sort of hard
to pray aright."


I knew he'd ask more questions if he knew about my sister
--who was perfectly well now, thank heaven, and married
--with a strapping eleven-year-old son. But there had
been times when I let just the memory of her sickness stand
between me and marriage. If epilepsy <i>was</i> hereditary--as
one old doctor had told us--I didn't want to pass it on to
anyone. And even when, in my own research, I'd learned
that that old theory of heredity had been abandoned--and
found a drug named Dilantin that was able to help epileptic
cases--I still avoided marriage.


Though I did not use any drugs myself or believe that
the general use of them was advisable, I passed the news
about Dilantin on to my family, and they consulted a specialist
mentioned in an article I'd found in <i>Time</i> magazine.
From then on, the blood-freezing cries in the night
stopped... the phone calls from our friends or police
to come and get her... until the entire problem was
finally controlled.

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697839-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I couldn't talk of this to John or anyone. But I could
enjoy his company.


One day, after a luncheon in the auditorium--where the
TV Department had entertained visiting firemen (Rotarians,
actually) from nearby towns--we two climbed a hill
that was verboten and out of bounds... particularly to
a man and woman walking together. So I went first, and
he followed along later.


The other side of the mountain turned out to be just as
barren of foliage in which even a kiss might be stolen as
the side facing Estrelita, and he pointed out to me how these
foothills grew toward the north and east into full-size mountains.
Far toward the west there was a tiny patch of sparkling
sea. He showed me a tiny grove of trees far in the distance.


"See--way over there to the southwest?" It looked about
two or three miles away. "That's the way I went the <i>first</i>
time I ran away."


"The <i>first</i> time...!"


"I'd like to go again... right over that mountain--if
I had the guts. Just keep going and never stop."


"When did you run away?"


"Right after I first came here. I went south--over that
hill... then down that valley to the grove of trees...
then into Oleander."


"What happened?"


"The police picked me up--while I was waiting at the
servicemen's pickup station alone the highway. They had
a picture of me and said: ‘Aren't you from Estrelita?’ I said:
‘You know damn well I am.’ And they brought me back
here."


"How frustrating!"


"I'd try it again...!"


"You'd better not."


We wandered on over the hill, searching for a cave--or a
grove of trees--or a patch of brush on this barren cactus-covered

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697839-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What are those for?" I wondered.


"Perhaps he keeps water in them."


"Or maybe he's running a still up here. Fermented cactus.
That stone tank on top of the hill would be a good
place to put it."


"That's a chimney--from the laundry below."


"Oh."


"That's where they let off steam--when you hear that
whistle blow."


"I thought that whistle meant somebody had escaped."


"No. I don't think they do that here."


"A nurse told me many of the wards here used to be
open--but so many of the patients escaped.... She said
the <i>hospital</i> didn't mind too much..."


"They didn't?"


"No, but the farmers roundabout did. They missed so
many of the things the escapees needed to get along. So we
got locked up."


"I'll go...! Someday I'll <i>go!</i>" John had been scraping
some of the loose, crumbling dirt out of the foxhole. "It
isn't exactly a palace, but--"


"We could build up that wall--with more brush--put a
roof on...." It was all so open--with seven thousand people
in view!


"It's the dirtiest place I've ever made love...."


"I don't mind. I got this coat for free--at the Hut--and
it needs cleaning anyhow."


We had to duck our heads down, for even to sit upright

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697839-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

John told me that one of his supervisors was an avowed
alcoholic. "And he told me he's constantly having to fight
his feminine characteristics."


"Great! What a place! The nuts are put in charge of us."


"I'm going...!" vowed John. "I'm <i>going!</i>"


Next morning--as soon as the door from our ward into
the high-walled courtyard was opened--I smuggled a blanket
out and tossed it over the wall. Then--on my way to the
television studio--I grabbed up the blanket and carried
it out to our foxhole. At last our home was being furnished!
I took some food along too--an apple I had--and a sweater.


When I met John at TV, he opened the blue EI (Estrelita
Issue) jacket he was wearing and showed me his red
sweater and a suit underneath. "I'm on my way," he whispered.


"<i>Leaving</i>... ?"


He nodded. I couldn't be more astonished. So <i>sudden!</i>
"We're having a ward party this afternoon," I suggested,
hoping to hold him. "Why don't you come?"


"Okay," he agreed. And instead of going to TV that afternoon,
we went to the party which the girls of Ward 8 were
giving for the men of 12-A. I felt that one extra man
wouldn't be very noticeable, so I smuggled John in. As it
turned out, some of the other girls from our ward smuggled
in friends too. Muu-Muu talked to him--and showed him
pictures of her daughter--while I went into my dorm to
round up any escape supplies that might be handy.

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697839-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I returned with a brown paper bag filled with a spoon, a
pair of kindergarten shears (the only type we're allowed to
have), some candy, cookies, and a few chapters from an old
Bible. He balked at the Bible.


"Do I have to?"


"No, but it will help to have someone to trust in."


"I'm trusting in myself," he said.


Before the party was over, we went out. "I'm going up to
the foxhole," he whispered, "and stay there till dark. Then
I leave."


"Good luck," I murmured. "Good luck." And I felt like
an undercover spy in a Grade D Hollywood movie.


We kissed goodby at the corner--in the most obvious spot
on the whole campus: right across from the canteen. Then
we both turned and went our separate ways: he over the
hill, I to TV. There I found a popcorn machine spewing
forth delicious butter-drenched morsels into red-and-white-striped
paper bags.


I picked up a couple of bagfuls--and a coffee can which
I filled with water--then started up the hill from a new
direction. En route I found a silver Maltese cross--actually
the old chrome-plated handle off a cold-water faucet--which
I thought significant... and managed to cut my toe on a
rock. Rubber beachwalkers were never made for climbing
mountains.


As I climbed over the top of the hill, I could see him
lying in the foxhole, wrapped in the blanket and reading
the magazine. I was quite close before he spotted me.
"You're asking for trouble!"


"I've just brought some food," I murmured without looking
in his direction. I left it on a rock about ten feet from
the foxhole... then headed for the Estrelita side of the
hill. "Goodby--and good luck!"


The next morning I went back up the mountain. He was
gone, but the blanket was there--and some of the food. He'd

That was nearly six weeks ago. I've waited in writing this
story--hoping I might have some word of him. He promised
to write, and I gave him two stamps among his supplies.
But no word is good word. Surely if he'd been caught and
brought back, I'd have wind of it by now.


John made it--I'm sure. I hope they never, ever find him.

[p. <i>[128]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697839-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
