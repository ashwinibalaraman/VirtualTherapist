<b>Year Two--Two Immortalities</b>


He lived with Lin in Santa Cruz until spring, taking some classes at the
community college. They talked about his going back to Reed in the fall and
worked on lining up enough financial aid to do it without putting Lin too
much more in the hole. He came back to L.A. in May (1992) to live with me
for the summer, working part time at Cafe Athens and at several other jobs he
held for short periods. He got jobs easily and lost them just as easily. I didn't
worry too much about this. Charley had always had a hard time staying
employed, but at least now he was trying to work and stay engaged. He
seemed sane but a bit hyper. I attributed that to romantic exertion. He had one
serious love affair that spring and summer as well as several more casual ones.
At one point he was dating two women named Jenny (like his sister) and flirting
with one or two non-Jennys. Even with Charley's excellent hand-eye
coordination, the concentration required to juggle so many Jennys would have
made anybody a little nervous.

There were only a few reminders of the previous summer's breakdown. One
was when Charley told me he was applying to Maharishi International
University (MIU) in Iowa, which was connected to the self-realization institute
in Pacific Palisades where he had started looking for god consciousness
through transcendental meditation the year before. The idea that he was still
interested in TM concerned me, but I didn't want to be excessively parental,
and I doubted he would end up going to MIU anyway. Reed still seemed to
be his first choice. So I pushed the Maharishi and his "unified field-based system
of education" out of my mind.


He still talked occasionally about the piano as a career. The Franz Liszt
dream or some variation was still alive, although how alive I wasn't sure. It was
his business and I tried to stay out of it. I told him that if he really wanted to
make music his career I was sure he would find a way.


Only once during the summer do I remember his indicating concern about
having another breakdown. One night in my kitchen after dinner we were
talking and he said something like, "I wonder what it would be like to take
Navane again."


I tried to sound casual. "Why? Do you feel like you're at risk of having
another episode?"


"No, not really," he murmured.


I let it go, not wanting to push it--not wanting to <i>think</i> about it. Later, I
would learn that these casual remarks always meant something. Later still, when
I read his journals, I would find out how <i>much</i> that something could be.
Charley's writings in the spring and summer of 1992 are particularly revealing
because they came at a time when his inner life was particularly complex. He
was in love with one of the Jennys. He was also over his postbreakdown lull
and entering an as-yet controllable upswing whose destination he couldn't
clearly see. His journal indicates that he was for a while more serious about
Maharishi International University than I realized at the time, for reasons that
became clear when I found the draft of an essay he wrote in his application to
the school. The essay talks about two types of education, "the channelled" and
"the experienced," one being formal study, the other being the knowledge one
gets through
<blockquote>
<p>
working, travelling, interacting with more sorts of people.... From the experience
</p><p>[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
I've had with my TM teacher and TM center, I've gathered that students of MIU
appreciate greatly both knowledge and experience in an ideal balance with each
other. I believe that the approach which MIU takes toward a holistic education is
both unique and visionary.... The school I am presently attending, Reed College,
though well respected in its reputation for the pursuit of intellectualism, seems
almost one dimensional in that the knowledge which the students come to grasp
is not really incorporated into their lives. The students become surly, unkempt in
their attire, and cynical toward life and ever finding contentment in what they
believe is a hopeless world. They are continuously overloaded with work which
to them seems generally pointless and impertinent.

working, travelling, interacting with more sorts of people.... From the experience

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It appears that MIU does not buy into this impertinence but has a healthy
attitude toward finding happiness in life and education.


Even allowing for the college-application "Why MIU is right for me" tone,
I think Charley's formulation of how he saw education (and life) was sincere.
He wanted something less rigorously academic than the intellectualism offered
by Reed, something more artistic, a better balance of structure and "experience."
But he wanted more. Journal entries from the same period show that
Charley was restless again and feeling nostalgia for the higher consciousness he
had gained at Yosemite. Viewed in the context of this nostalgia, his continued
interest in TM, which was the basis of MIU's "unified field" program, looks like
a desire to regain the previous summers god consciousness, but in a more
structured and safe environment. MIU seemed to promise both god consciousness
and safety.


But then, in his journal of May 13, 1992, Charley writes about being awakened
that morning by a call from an admissions person from MIU who had
read his application.


He had many questions to ask, and it was somewhat disconcerting so early in
the day. He asked me what I've been doing for the past eight months. How can
I tell him, nothing, since I've been recovering from a nervous breakdown? I felt
he was prying almost cynically into my life. He then told me never to smoke
marijuana again and that I must meditate regularly. He said he didn't want to
dictate my life to me, then he did just that. His attitude wasn't that of one who
wanted to welcome me aboard and just had to ask a few bureaucratic questions,
but more with the intention of weeding out any individuals who are not pure
enough to join the MIU community. Enough 4 2nite.

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The school's finger-wagging probably marked the end of any genuine interest
Charley had in MIU--even when it sent him an acceptance letter two
months later that I found among his papers. As far as I know he ignored it.
"Give me chastity, but not yet!" St. Augustine had written. Charley's version
might have been, "Give me structure, but not yet!" The next journal entry,
written late the following night (May 14), ranges far and wide. MIU is
nowhere to be found.


As the full moon approaches sleep does not come easily. What can I do? God
knows I need rest after such a long day. Today I was at the clothing store
unpacking boxes and boxes of packages of clothing. Now my mind wanders
searching for fulfillment.... Does the moon's effect on me mean I have a
lunatic's tendencies? I smoke, yet find little satisfaction lately. I have strange
dreams these days about psych wards, nurses, and more madness. Will I devote
my life to intellectualism or music or shall I meander about in search of meaning
I will never find? What else is there besides what we perceive with our five
senses? I'd give anything to know. Will I ever find my right therapist? How will
it be when I return to Reed and all its impertinence, leaving Jenny behind?
These questions trouble me tonight. My dad said he would buy me the watch
I want next week. <i>I've come to understand little by little the root of my psychosis last
summer. Having delved into the pit of my soul after a series of events I discovered there
was nothing there besides pain, hopelessness, and a desire yet a repulsion for death.
Having achieved for a brief while immortal consciousness, I wanted to transcend this
piteous world, but was at the same time forced to stay here being undeniably attached to
my mortal body</i>. (emphasis added)


Like other journal entries quoted earlier, the writing here, the jumping from
topic to topic, indicates a heightened mood. It is caused or exacerbated by
sleeplessness, and it expresses worry, even dread, of going mad again. The italicized
passage is permanently obscure. The "psychosis" Charley refers to can
only mean the breakdown at Yosemite, since in the days and weeks before the
camping trip he had been rational, although perhaps teetering on the edge
after weeks of sleeplessness. But clarity ends there. He does not explain the
"series of events" that led to his soul-searching and desire for transcendence.
Did it involve the girl he stood too close to at the campground? Did it result
in the fear that made him crawl into his mother's sleeping bag at four in the
morning? Not even the meaning of his attempt "to transcend this piteous

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

began to have delusions of grandeur and began to experience auditory hallucinations
[hearing voices]. He reported being attracted to a young lady at the
camp and felt "vibrations" that she was also attracted to him. He never spoke to
her but he made a public disturbance at the camp which he thought would in
some way attract this young woman and [make her] want his attention.
Following this the patient had a single-car accident, totaling his vehicle because
he tried to drive with his eyes closed, guided by his hallucinatory percept.
Remarkably he was not injured.


But then Charley's San Francisco General medical records state:
<blockquote>
<p>
Initially, the patient reported that he was driving with his eyes closed and
believed that the "force" would help him to drive the car and was experiencing
auditory and visual hallucinations.... Upon admission to Unit 7A, the patient
changed this report and claims that it was a suicide attempt and that he was
actually trying to kill himself as a result of depression.
</p>
</blockquote>

auditory and visual hallucinations.... Upon admission to Unit 7A, the patient
changed this report and claims that it was a suicide attempt and that he was
actually trying to kill himself as a result of depression.


These two accounts of the crash correspond to two different versions of the
psychosis itself that he wrote later, several months apart. One version is
the May 14 "root of my psychosis" journal entry that I quoted above. In this
version the crash seems to have been a conscious suicide attempt ("I wanted
to transcend this piteous world") resulting from profound, even psychotic
depression ("pain, hopelessness, and a desire yet a repulsion for death"). But
compare this to another, undated entry written in Santa Cruz three or four
months earlier when Charley was still recovering and feeling (in his words)
"idle and withdrawn":
<blockquote>
<p>
I don't think I shall ever be fully content until I rediscover what I discovered
in Yosemite in July '91. I don't wish to only find it once more but to understand
</p><p>[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
it. Yes, to understand how it was I had reached "God Consciousness," how I felt
a [word missing] of energy when I heard the birds chirp, how when I put my
hand to where the river flowed over the rocks it began to flow more strongly,
how I was able to drive so fast through the winding mountain roads. How?

in Yosemite in July '91. I don't wish to only find it once more but to understand

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But why, when I went home to L.A. did I fall into a state of utter destitution?


In this version the "destitution" only came after, not at, Yosemite: At
Yosemite itself there was no pain, no hopelessness, no desire to transcend the
piteous world. No car crash. The author only remembers the sensation of driving
"so fast through the winding mountain roads," not what came after.


There is no reason to think that either version was a lie. Rather, they probably
expressed two very different memories of the same phenomena written
in two different mood states, showing how complex and changing Charley's
moods and thought patterns were, how closely the "no" was always entwined
with the "yes." Viewed this way, the two versions of both the psychosis and the
crash may not be as contradictory as they seem. Later, in examining the phenomenon
in manic-depression known as "mixed states," we will see that such
rapid shifts of mood and thought are not uncommon.


But for now let us return to Charley's May 14 journal entry, which continues
without a break after the <i>"piteous world"</i> passage italicized two pages above:
<blockquote>
<p>
What did I learn, what did I gain? I learned we are all stuck here and must
endure the pain, however trying it may be. And the meaning? As one fellow at
the hospital said, it is to establish a relationship with the Almighty and learn to
work with it as best we can. Hmph!
</p>
</blockquote>

endure the pain, however trying it may be. And the meaning? As one fellow at
the hospital said, it is to establish a relationship with the Almighty and learn to
work with it as best we can. Hmph!


Why the "Hmph!"? I think there is something fundamental being expressed
here. For Charley, the experience at Yosemite hadn't meant establishing a relationship
<i>with</i> the Almighty. It had meant <i>being</i> the Almighty--or at least the
Almighty's infallible vicar, as illustrated in the card of the psychedelic pope he had
sent me at Christmas. Like many others in the furthest throes of mania, Charley
had come to believe, if only "for a brief while," that "I ha[d] the ability to see all
the beauty in the world as if I were the Creator." Good work if you can get it, but
how do you stay employed as God if pretty girls don't respond to your vibrations
and their fathers report you to the authorities--or if your own father starts

The journal entry continues:
<blockquote>

Adieu pour la nuit, Charley, (emphasis in the original)


There's a lot going on in this passage, written during a sleepless night, the
full moon approaching. All of Charley's basic insecurities about his talents and
his future--the roots of the Yosemite breakdown--are still present. He still feels
the need to redeem himself, to find a "place in the world" that will give him
status and solidity and allow him to avoid the fate of his Latino coworkers, a
fate that is particularly scary because he can see its outline in himself as well--
in the form of his parents' influence. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_17587');">[note]</a><div id="_note_17587" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1 I am inferring this from a journal entry of about five weeks later (June 19)
where Charley talks about "learning the proletarian lifestyle" (as Lin and I
had done years before) by working at Café Athens. He's having problems
saving money, which he attributes to his relations with his parents. "My
parents have a problem with money, with being comfortable with it. Both
Mom and Dad have a sort of money complex (perhaps owing to their former
political ideology, their familial backgrounds--something or other--I
really don't know) but my plan is to break away from these detrimental
patterns and live a healthy financial existence...."</div> He had been counting on Maharishi
International University to help him, to provide a safe haven in which he could

I think this switching back and forth between achieving god consciousness
through TM and being a great artist was a recurring pattern in Charley's psychology,
a sort of path A and path B. The switch had already happened once
after Yosemite when, failing to transcend the world after achieving immortal
consciousness, his fantasy self-metamorphosed from being God to being Franz
Liszt. Achieving god consciousness, in other words, was the preferred choice.
When that failed, as it inevitably did, the only slightly less exalted but more
labor-intensive path of becoming a great artist (first writer, then pianist, later
actor), took its place. Taking the still more rigorous academic route, full of surly,
unkempt youths and work overload, was path C. Below that was path D, "the
proletarian lifestyle," being stuck forever unpacking boxes and busing tables.
But this was less a real path than the absence of one. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_19936');">[note]</a><div id="_note_19936" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">2 In a journal entry about five weeks later Charley expresses this himself in
a very interesting way:
<blockquote>
<p>
It's 1:20 A.M. Sunday morning, time to make another entry. I'm sitting at
the kitchen table of my father's apartment, with lots of stuff on my mind. I've
just taken a shower, having washed myself of the restaurant business. That's
another subject I'm tired of thinking about, but while I'm on it I may as well
mention the dream I had last night. I had just matriculated into the San
Francisco Conservatory of Music and I was arranging my accommodations
(the school does not provide this in reality) and was incorporating myself
into the place when I noticed two busboys from my restaurant came in planning
to attend. All else I can remember is that I felt threatened by this, quite
deeply. My interpretation of this is simple. My feeling threatened by the busboys
represents the desire I have to live a lifestyle above the working class,
not among them. It's a wish to be separated by [sic] that "cruel" world and
have values which they cannot appreciate. This subconscious phenomenon is
incongruous with reality because I fraternize openly with my coworkers and
do not take a haughty attitude with them in the least. Perhaps this dream is
impertinent [doesn't pertain] to the busboys per se and is mostly demonstrative
of my true desire to live outside the mainstream.
</p>
</blockquote>
In other words, the busboys in the dream invading SFCM weren't the
Central American and Mexican refugees "who work like mules for rich
men," as Charley had written earlier, people he worked with and respected.
They were the part of him--the ordinary, proletarian part--that he was
trying to escape but that kept dogging him, both in his dreams and in his
actual life. He also, as I mentioned, associated this part of himself with his
parents, with our history, which he could not really understand, of giving
up our educational and other advantages to go to work in factories and
other less-remunerative jobs.</div>


It's 1:20 A.M. Sunday morning, time to make another entry. I'm sitting at
the kitchen table of my father's apartment, with lots of stuff on my mind. I've
just taken a shower, having washed myself of the restaurant business. That's

impertinent [doesn't pertain] to the busboys per se and is mostly demonstrative
of my true desire to live outside the mainstream.


I have listed these four paths in what seems to be the order of Charley's own
preference at this time in his life. In terms of his actual previous history, however--
what had led him to this point--I believe the list needs revision. This is
because path A--god consciousness--had not always existed, but had come
into existence only at Yosemite. In a sense, the breakdown at Yosemite was path
A, taken as the result of years of growing tension and doubts regarding his
future, which he usually saw as one of being an artist.


As I have indicated, in the three years before Yosemite, starting with his visit
to San Francisco and first episode of insomnia, Charley was periodically visited
by the notion that he was a person of extraordinary talent, a genius, destined
to perform extraordinary deeds in both art and life. But at the same time as he
was convinced of his genius he was also plagued by doubts about it, afraid he
was deluding himself, and unsure of how to realize his ambition and turn it
into actual achievement.


Charley was still very young, only fifteen, when these severe mood swings
(known as <i>cyclothymia</i>) began. Further, they came on top of a lifelong history

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Charley's youth and previous history when his first episode of insomnia and
hypomania occurred at fifteen may have been crucial factors in the later havoc
his disorder was able to wreak. He simply was not old enough to have
developed a sense of himself and his place in the world that was sufficiently
strong or flexible to survive the increasingly powerful pummelings of his
moods, which acted as a kind of psychological wrecking ball. Making the problem
worse was that the same powerful nervous energy that gave rise to his
extreme ambition also undermined his ability to focus or concentrate on realizing
it. First he wanted to be a great writer, then a great pianist; later it would
be acting. But his growing instability--the mood swings and the insomnia, as
well as his attempts to deal with these through drugs, alcohol, coffee--made any
kind of sustained effort difficult. Charley was a talented writer and musician, but
actual accomplishment, at least to the extent he desired it and thought it would
"save" him, remained elusive. He was a fine pianist; his music teacher at Reed
said he was the most musical student on campus. He would play a piece--say, a
Chopin impromptu--for hours, going back and forth, evening out the rough
spots, showing concentration that seemed to elude him in other areas of his life.
(As he said himself, playing the piano was a way of not going crazy: perhaps, like
his various substances, it was a kind of self-medication, a calming influence.) But
despite his intentions (<i>"I will practice relentlessly to prepare myself for the audition for
SFCM"</i>) he showed little interest in doing the fingering exercises and long
hours of boring work necessary to become a professional. As a result he was
bound to fall short of his own expectations. So what to do? "Transcend" the
norm through meditation and visualization and higher consciousness. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_25731');">[note]</a><div id="_note_25731" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">3 Years later, after Charley's death, I found a sheet of paper in his desk entitled
"The Warren W. Wilcox Hallucinogenic State," which outlines eight steps
to achieving that state. After presenting steps for relaxing (correct body
position, deep breathing, concentration), it culminates with steps six and
seven:
<blockquote>
<p>
6. <b>Hypnagogic Imagery.</b> If you have been able to relax fully, and not
become distracted, an image may suddenly appear in your mind. Often the
image is a clear picture, like on a postcard. These images come from deep in
your mind and may or may not be familiar to you. Again, during this stage,
it is important not to consciously think about anything, or try to make
something appear. Let your mind create for you and just watch. Later we
will work on controlling your images.
</p>
<p>
7. <b>Goal Imagery.</b> As you gain skill in relaxation technique, it will become
possible for you to control your imagery. Pick a habit or fault, or a project
for self-improvement, and imagine yourself as free and happy as you would
really like to be. Then go through the Scale and create a hypnagogic image
that helps you toward this goal. For instance, a worried, nervous person
could picture himself as smiling and relaxed. A person trying to quit smoking
could see herself as relaxed and free from the habit, able to smell again,
etc. You will find that <i>being able to see yourself</i> as you really want to be helps
you to <i>be</i> that way.
</p>

image is a clear picture, like on a postcard. These images come from deep in
your mind and may or may not be familiar to you. Again, during this stage,
it is important not to consciously think about anything, or try to make
something appear. Let your mind create for you and just watch. Later we
will work on controlling your images.


7. <b>Goal Imagery.</b> As you gain skill in relaxation technique, it will become
possible for you to control your imagery. Pick a habit or fault, or a project
for self-improvement, and imagine yourself as free and happy as you would
really like to be. Then go through the Scale and create a hypnagogic image
that helps you toward this goal. For instance, a worried, nervous person
could picture himself as smiling and relaxed. A person trying to quit smoking
could see herself as relaxed and free from the habit, able to smell again,
etc. You will find that <i>being able to see yourself</i> as you really want to be helps
you to <i>be</i> that way.


I think Charley's growing fear of failure, and his attempts to surmount it, were
what led to the breakdown at Yosemite, where all thoughts of pianos and such
seemed to disappear during the romantic fixation on the girl camper and the
attempt at suicide/transcendence that followed, only to reappear a few days later
when he found himself still alive and still facing life choices about school,

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Still later, even after his recovery the following fall and winter, the thoughts
(and doubts) about his genius were still there. In the journal passage where he
talks about himself "as if I were the Creator," written in Santa Cruz the winter
after Yosemite (see p. 22), Charley attributes his earlier achievement of god
consciousness to the fact that "I am by nature a genius, though my brilliance
has apparently been resting ... the past few months. I know I have genius and I
deserve to have what was rightly mine previously. God has granted it to me. I
deserve love, fulfillment, contentment. My mental breakdown has been an educational
process. <i>It is now time to move on</i>." (emphasis Charley's) This comes a
few lines after saying he practices TM twice a day.


But move on where? By the following May he is having heightened moods
again and is trying to figure out how to achieve, or reachieve, immortality. But
now there are two kinds of immortality, what I previously called path A and
path B, alternating in his mind: the immortality of god consciousness (the ego
as God achievable <i>"through meditation? introspection? exploration? starvation?"</i>) and
the more human immortality of artistic achievement. But this second kind,
decomposing and recomposing as it does, may be out of reach because it
involves sustained effort that given Charley's instability is difficult or impossible.

<i>Madness--a haiku</i>


<i>One vision, one thought<br />
Come together forming naught<br />
All things are the same</i>.


In the end, that's what god consciousness seems to have come down to.


It was in this frame of mind that Charley faced his first post-Yosemite summer
and the prospect of resuming his "surly, unkempt" real life.


Toward the end of summer, his return to Reed approaching, he seemed to
be getting more antsy, but I wrote it off to nervousness. Lin came down from
Santa Cruz and the three of us drove the eleven hundred miles from L.A. to
Portland together. We hadn't done this at the start of Charley's freshman year,
and it seemed like a delayed rite of passage.


<b>Once More to the Underworld</b>


<i>I've returned to you, Reed<br />
My precious dear Reed,<br />
Without whom my soul would<br />

so well</i>.

<i>("To Reed, with Thanks," Fall 1992)</i>


But the real world would again encroach into the ivy halls of academe.
Charley's edginess on the trip to Portland was more serious than I wanted to
admit at the time. Along with the mood swings and nostalgia for god consciousness,
which I did not know about, there had been more visible signs of
tumult during the past months--some emotional volatility (he cried to me one
night after his boss criticized him at work) and some drinking. Perhaps most
serious was his ongoing infatuation with Jenny Lewis, one of the two nonsister
Jennys. Jenny Lewis had been the main reason for his leaving Santa Cruz
for L.A. the previous spring. Charley had met her while she and her brother
Danny were visiting Lin in late winter; they were longtime friends of Charley's
sister and acquaintances of Lin. Charley, smitten, had followed Jenny Lewis
back down south, actually moving in with her for a while in March (she lived
in Venice, just south of Santa Monica) before reinstalling himself in my apartment.
The affair did not last. Jenny Lewis was ten years older than Charley and
also very volatile, and after a few weeks of living together she wrote him a
letter asking him to move out. Charley took the rejection hard. He talked to
me about it several times, the last time by phone when he was back at Reed.
My journal of September 7 discusses the conversation in depth, and I quote it
here because I think it gives a sense of the complexity of Charley's and my

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

10:40 Labor Day night. Just talked for an hour to Charley on the phone. He's
been at Reed for two weeks and is very upset about breaking up with Jenny
Lewis. He thinks that she's heartless and cruel for not responding to his phone
calls etc. and not being upfront with him. He got upset with me for being cold
and objective in my analysis and trying to convince him just to let it go. After
a while we started communicating better, I apologizing, partly tactically, for not
being more sympathetic. Jenny Aurthur told me today that Jenny Lewis had
changed her number to avoid his calls, and Lin told me last week that Danny
had told Charley to stop harassing Jenny Lewis, so I was perhaps overreacting
on the side of the harassment issue (how serious it is I don't know) than on the
sympathy issue; i.e., more worried about Charley's potentially or actually obsessive
and potentially dangerous behavior than I should have been. I'm not sure.
We started to connect better later in the conversation when I talked about male
romanticism and men's tendencies to set up impossible ideals for women and
then be horribly disappointed when they don't live up to them; and how men
(the corollary) also set up impossible ideals for themselves relating (as Charley
said) to "providing" for women, saving them, etc., and then being crushed when
those don't work either. He asked if that meant there wasn't a place for romance
in the world and I used the analogy of banana splits: they're good once in a
while but we wouldn't want to live on them. Then about Stendhal's dual perspective
and how that can save us from going off the deep end. I tried to appeal
to Charley's amour propre, asked him if he was writing in a journal, that that
helps, that there are meetings available (Relationships Anonymous?) etc.... The
conversation got a little better toward the end.


He's obviously going through a very painful separation. I told him about my
relationship with Claire [a youthful crush] and how similar it was, how it often
happens that the other person is going through a completely different thing
than you are and has no idea what effect she's causing or else doesn't care, and
how we can't make them care. The only thing we can do is start the process of
getting over it by admitting, first, that it's over. As Charley said, the hardest part.
I have to think about this more and remember my own feelings in similar situations.
It's not as easy as I sounded, I know that.


Nothing we can do will make them care; at least nothing actively. The sooner
we realize that the better off we will be. Charley's into this whole thing of, She'll
be sorry. But she probably won't; and if she is it won't matter anyway.


"This is not therapeutic," he said midway through the conversation when I
was being too rough, and I had to change my approach. I just hope he doesn't

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But such talks did no good, and the summer's jitters soon bloomed into a
full-fledged manic episode. I heard about it secondhand from Lin when
Charley visited her in Santa Cruz in October and acted spacey--"psychotic,"
in her words, which I took seriously, knowing her dislike of psychiatric jargon.
On November 18 he called me from school sounding very weird, and I
thought about the call the previous year in San Francisco before his second
hospitalization. This time was different, though. He was not dreamy and elegiac
but manic, motor mouthed. He told me that David Bowie was communicating
with him, that he was writing a note to an "Irish babe"--one of his
campus crushes--on a dollar bill with his 1925 Underwood typewriter, and
that he was practicing the piano to get into Juilliard. I asked him if he was getting
ready for another trip to the psych ward. He became offended and told
me I was "grilling" him. I felt entitled to be blunt, though, because he had
written me the following letter a few days earlier:
<blockquote>
<p>
Mon Cher Père: It takes an especial effort these days for a man to write his
father. With no kings and queens and only ridiculous presidents it is difficult to
know who is in charge. I can only say it is a son's duty and to aspire to greatness
we must look to ancestry in sincere retrospection with the hope of learning
</p><p>[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
through trial and error. If we look merely to the philosophers we shall only find
that we prostitute ourselves.

When I suggested to my piano teacher that I play Gershwin as a form of
nationalism during this country's dire condition he said queerly, "You wanna
save Western civilization." I might have lied when I said I had no intention of
doing so. I can also say I am tired of the trips to the underworld. I wrote to
Brian Marsh that the voices therein are like parakeets in a stolen cave. I saw <i>Last
of the Mohicans</i> the other day with two friends. I will grant that Day-Lewis was
completely charmless and that the film was essentially a drag.


So, in reading books like <i>L'étranger</i> in one class and <i>To the Lighthouse</i> in
another we students are bound to know corruption in a thousand ways. The
Hum 220 lectures are fascinating, however, I have to tell you.


I promise to make it safely to L.A. by Christmas, et vous, attention à travers les
rues sur la bicyclette. Votre fils.


I took this as a sign that he wanted me to know he was flipping out. Two
days after the "Irish babe" call--Friday--he called again, telling me he felt
"scared," that he had come from outer space like <i>The Man Who Fell to Earth</i> (a
David Bowie film) or Superman. I told him the role of Superman was already
taken. I also told him to try and get some rest over the weekend. The following
week was Thanksgiving and he would be able to get away from school for
a few days.


I wasn't being completely callous. Between the two phone calls I had tried
to contact the school's medical staff to see whether they knew that Charley was
flipping out. The school psychologist was out of the office, and her secretary
told me that yes, they were aware of Charley's situation but for confidentiality
reasons couldn't give out any information. On Sunday night I got a call back
from the school physician, not the psychologist. He told me almost apologetically
that Charley was back in the hospital.


Again the path to the psych ward had started with a romantic fixation,
although it was no longer Jenny Lewis. Sometime in the past few weeks she
had stopped being the object of Charley's romantic longing, and he had
replaced her with one of his female professors. He had decided that the two of
them had a mystical psychosexual kinship (later he wrote that he felt intense
sexual longings for her), and during an after-class conference he tried to kiss
her on the cheek. A little later he grabbed the faculty office keys from a campus
cop and tried to get into her office (she wasn't there at the time) to gather

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next day, the Monday before Thanksgiving, I talked on the phone to
the psychiatrist at Adventist and got an idea of the hospital's plans, which were
largely determined by economics. Since I hadn't put Charley in the hospital--
hadn't even known he was going in until two days afterward because of the
school's confidentiality concerns--I wasn't financially responsible, and Charley
had no insurance of his own. There was no one who was going to pay, in other
words, so Adventist wanted him out as soon as the hold was up (the following
Monday), sooner if possible. There were two places Charley could go, the psy-
chiatrist said: the state mental hospital in a town south of Portland or a local
county psychiatric facility in Portland called Ryles Center. Later that day I
talked to a court evaluator, a woman with a private agency contracted by the
county mental health system and in touch with Adventist. Her job was to figure
out what to do with Charley when and if he had a hearing to get the hold
released. The tentative plan was to keep him on the hold as long as possible and
see how he did back on Navane, then send him for a week or more to Ryles
Center, avoiding the state mental hospital. Meanwhile, the evaluator would talk
to Reed about granting him a medical leave.


It all sounded very abstract to me. The prospect of a state hospital somewhere
outside Portland didn't bode well, and I had no idea what Ryles Center
was like. But at least Charley wasn't going anywhere till after Thanksgiving,
three days away, so I had a little time. I told the evaluator I would be in Portland
by Wednesday. I called Lin in Santa Cruz. She said she would meet me in
Portland Thanksgiving morning.


I still didn't have a car, so I decided to go by bus, partly because airfare was
very expensive booked on such short notice and partly because twenty-three-hour
bus rides can be very calming, at least if you have a window seat and
you're not all that anxious to get where you're going anyway. Why rush?
Charley was safe, and I knew the kind of reception I was going to get. The
evaluator had said that when she interviewed him in the psych ward he was

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I arrived in Portland early Wednesday afternoon, rented a car and drove to
Reed to meet with the school psychologist and dean of students. Even now, after
all the disruption Charley had caused, they both told me how fond of him they
were, what a great kid he was, and how they would even be willing to take him
back after winter break if he got better and kept up with his assignments at
home. The next morning I picked Lin up at the Greyhound station; to save
money she had also come by bus. We drove to the hospital to visit Charley (I for
the second time; I had already seen him Wednesday evening). He was in his
imperious mode: haughty, superior, contemptuous of the hospital, the staff,
humanity in general and his parents in particular. He was planning a lawsuit
against the hospital for not letting him smoke.


This was what I had come eleven hundred miles for. I had expected the imperiousness
but it was still hard to get used to. It was part of the mania, I knew,
although he didn't appear manic. It was also a defense mechanism to try to deal
with his essential helplessness. A few days ago everything had been great--well,
at least intermittently great, between phone calls about last suppers and crucifixions.
He had been at school writing love letters to "Irish babes" on dollar bills
and communing with David Bowie, feeling mystical bonds with good-looking
women professors, his mind and libido in turbo drive. Now, suddenly, he was
back in the psych ward on the hated Navane, monitored, prodded, asked "How
are you doing?" and "So ... what's going on with you?" by condescending
shrinks and clueless parents. Who wouldn't be pissed off? But it was still always
hard for me to feel sorry for Charley when he was in his imperious mode. I preferred
feeling sorry for myself.


After visiting hours, Lin and I had Thanksgiving dinner at Carrow's, a
regional chain restaurant near the Motel 6 where we were staying. The dinner,
counterintuitively, turned out to be an antidote to self-pity, the midwestern
blandness of the restaurant and its dry white meat and gluey gravy comforting
rather than depressing. I felt at home among the other diners, mostly
older Anglos who resembled my mother's family. Mom's parents had been

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Friday brought a turn for the better. The evaluator and the hospital had
decided Charley would go to Ryles Center rather than the out-of-town state
mental hospital, and he would do so today. Ryles was free because it was
county run. When Lin and I got to Adventist in the morning for visiting hours
Charley knew he was about to leave and seemed much better.


We weren't prepared for how much better how fast. Ryles was located in a
residential part of town about a half mile from our Motel 6 and not far from
Reed. We knew Charley was due to arrive there via hospital transportation
sometime in the afternoon, so around midday we decided to take a walk by
the place to see what it looked like. It was a sunny, chilly, leaf-blown fall day,
and we felt reenergized as we strolled in the pleasant old neighborhood, soon
arriving at Ryles, which consisted of two one-story wood structures that could
have been houses. As we walked past we saw Charley through the front window.
He had just gotten there himself and was at the admissions desk. He saw
us and gave a big smile and wave. He seemed totally himself. It was as if Mom
and Dad had just dropped him off at summer camp and he was watching us
go. We kept walking--it wasn't visiting hours yet--shaking our heads in
amazement. When we went back later that evening for a real visit he still
seemed fine. As we got ready to leave, the staff person who had admitted him,
a young man named Jeff, walked us to the locked front door to buzz us out.
"How does he seem to you?" he asked.


"He seems like his old self," Lin said.


"So this is his baseline?"


"Yeah," I said. "That's Charley."


Lin took the bus back to Santa Cruz the next day. I stayed through the

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It sounded good to me. I had to get back to work. Charley actually seemed
comfortable--borderline happy. His mood was calm, at least with me, and he
and his bipolar caseworker had seemed to hit it off. The other patients were
mostly young folk he might actually relate to. I told Gayle I would go back to
L.A. and return to Portland for Charley's release.


Ryles was a locked facility but with some flexibility. Patients were considered
voluntary--no 5150 holds--which seemed to make the place a little
less asylum-ish. They were often allowed out on three- or four-hour community
passes, so the next evening, Sunday, I picked Charley up and we drove
across the Willamette River into Portland's downtown to have dinner at an
Indian restaurant he liked. He seemed miraculously better compared to a
week--even three days--before. During dinner and after--when we went
back to the motel and hung out for the rest of our three hours--he also
opened up to me more than he ever had before. Again, beyond the immediate
fixation on his professor, there had been a sexual (or "gender") aspect to his
latest episode. "I felt like the battle of the sexes was going on my head," he said,
using the phrase Lin had heard during the first breakdown. The two sides of
his brain had been at war with each other. "It was totally schizophrenia, Dad,"
he said, using the word himself, adding that his Aunt Ella had called him a
"paranoid schizophrenic" during his "sojourn" at San Francisco General the
year before.

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Despite it all, it was a wonderful evening, one of those eye-of-the-hurricane
times when all conventional ideas of what happiness and accomplishment and
everything else mean--what <i>meaning</i> means--go out the window. Here I was
in a cheap motel in a city I didn't particularly like, faced with a twenty-three-
hour bus ride the next morning, with a possibly schizophrenic son whom I was
about to take back to his locked facility--and, oh yes, I'd just realized that I'd
left my credit card at the restaurant, which was now closed. But I felt great. I
was having a great time with my kid.


I decided to start reading up on schizophrenia.


<b>"A Nice Birthday Present for Sis"</b>


<i>February 24, 1993</i>


Three months later. The phone was ringing at work again. The same office,
the same desk, the same time of day, a year and a half after the call from the
California Highway Patrol. This time the voice was Lin's, from her office a
couple of miles away (she had moved back to L.A. a month before). Charley
had just phoned her from my apartment. He had slit his wrists with his Swiss
army knife and wanted to know what to do.


I still didn't have a car, so we agreed that she would go get him and take
him to the St. John's Hospital emergency room; I would meet her on my bike
in a half-hour. Before leaving I called Charley and asked him how he was. He
didn't sound like he was dying, but he said he'd swallowed pills too, his lithium.
(Dr. Gray had put him on lithium in December.) He said he had already
thrown up some of it.


"Swallow some soap, Charley," I said. "Swallow some soap. Get it all up.
You're gonna be okay, okay? D'you understand what I'm saying?"


"Yeah. Swallow some soap...." He sounded very subdued. I told him to
wait for Mom, not to go anywhere. He said he'd wait. We hung up. I told my
supervisor what had happened and took off. It was three in the afternoon, the
day before his sister Jenny's twenty-second birthday.


As I pedaled toward the hospital I castigated myself for not having seen this
coming. Charley had been living with me since getting out of Ryles in
mid-December, working at Cafe Athens again, trying to take classes at Santa

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I got to the ER Lin was already there, sitting in the waiting room.
Charley was inside having his wrists treated and his stomach pumped. Dr. Gray
had been paged and was on his way. "I can't help thinking this has something
to do with Jenny's birthday," Lin said.


"Yeah, nice birthday present for Sis," I replied. Charley was always comparing
himself to Jenny--her relatively sanguine temperament, her wide social
circle, her devoted long-term boyfriend, her ability to finish school and hold a
job.


"I feel pissed off," Lin said. Her voice was tight. "I feel manipulated."


"Yeah, I know...," I said. "I feel like that a lot myself. Although right this
minute I don't. I know how miserable he's been." I told her about the discussion
on the futon two nights before. Why hadn't I listened better?


After a while, Lin was let in to see him. He didn't want to see me. That night
I wrote in my journal that the suicide attempt didn't seem completely serious.
"When I came home... all I found of the attempt, beside wet towels hanging
off the shower glass, was a trace of blood on the edge of the tub--a forlorn
little trace. It's so sad!... Poor little fellow! I feel so <i>sorry</i> for him. Helpless...
I should've asked him if he was thinking about suicide...."


He spent a day in the intensive care unit, then back to the hospital's psychiatric
wing, the unlocked ward this time. Then home with me again, now on even
more medication. Since Ryles, he had been taking Navane, Cogentin to

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All this witches' brew of medication made one thing clear, at least: Nobody
knew what Charley "had." The day after he cut his wrists, Lin and I met Dr.
Gray and we all visited Charley in the ICU to tell him everything was all right
and that we were going to try to do a better job of helping him. After we left
his room I asked Dr. Gray if he had a moment to talk. "Sure," he said, "let's have
a family meeting." He found an empty conference room nearby and he, Lin
and I met for almost an hour in an atmosphere that was fairly relaxed; Charley
was safe just yards away, being baby-sat--because of the suicide attempt--by a
nurses' aide. I asked Dr. Gray what he thought Charley's illness was, saying I
was totally confused. During the first breakdown Dr. Gray had theorized that
Charley might be manic-depressive. Then, after the Thanksgiving breakdown
at Reed, when I had asked him whether I should call UCLA's Affective
Disorders Clinic, which treated manic-depression, he had said no, he didn't
think they would take him--Charley didn't have an affective (mood) disorder --
in other words he <i>wasn't</i> manic-depressive. Now, three months later,
Charley was on schizophrenia medication (Navane) <i>and</i> manic-depression
medicine (lithium). Plus Dr. Gray was starting him on Wellbutrin for depression,
the third major mental illness. By now he had been treating Charley off
and on for a year and a half and had come to know him fairly well. So?


Dr. Gray shrugged. "Well, he could be both schizophrenic <i>and</i> manic-depressive.
The rule of thumb is that one out of a hundred people are
schizophrenic and one out of a hundred are manic-depressive. So one out of a
hundred times one out of a hundred are both."


I looked at Lin. "Well, we always said Charley was one in a million."


"Strictly speaking, one in ten thousand," she replied.We all laughed hollowly.


Lin and I talked about what we thought were the shortcomings of the
purely psychiatric approach, the fact that it hadn't stopped Charley from trying
to kill himself. She, as always, expressed her especial dissatisfaction with the
purely physical treatment he had been getting, the emphasis on medication,
and the fact that locked psych wards didn't seem to be the best approach to
helping people in crisis. Didn't they need love? To my surprise Dr. Gray didn't

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Lin and I weren't millionaires. We weren't paupers, either. Between the two
of us we earned more than $100,000 a year. But the kind of therapy Dr. Gray
was talking about would cost $30,000-40,000 a year, with at most a few hundred
covered by even the better types of mental health insurance. In Dr. Gray's
mind, any really effective treatment for whatever Charley had was only accessible
to millionaires. Short of that we could keep doing what we were doing,
which was to have him see Dr. Gray once a week for talk therapy. One session
cost $150--a lot for us, but affordable. Or he could go to a less expensive
shrink for talk therapy, a psychologist with a masters or Ph.D.; their going rate
was $100-110 per hour. Meanwhile, Dr. Gray would continue to see him for
a half session every two weeks ($85) to monitor and represcribe his medication.
We decided on this new approach, and Dr. Gray gave us the name of a
woman Ph.D. he knew.


Charley's depression didn't let up right away when he got out of the hospital,
wrists bandaged. He wanted to return to Cafe Athens immediately, and
we had an hour of black comedy preparing for his first night back at work, trying
to figure how to hide the bandages under the cuffs of his white busboy's
dress shirt so they wouldn't pop out when he reached across a table to fill a
diner's water glass. A pair of gloves seemed to work, although at least one of
Charley's coworkers saw through the ruse. "When Cado saw the bandages
around my wrist," Charley wrote in his journal,

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

he said, "You didn't do this stupid thing. You're so pretty and intelligent...."
Cado is a waiter and a guy I know. Sweet fellow. My sister told me on the phone
when I was in the hospital that she was angry at me for my selfish behavior. Two
black security guards were hounding me in the ER. "Why do you wanna do
yourself in for? The women get much better as you go on." I guess that's nice
to know. The scars I suppose will be a problem for a little while.


There were a couple more rough weeks as we waited for the antidepressant
to start working. When it finally did, it worked in a way it wasn't supposed to.
Rather than cure the depression, the Wellbutrin gave Charley a severe rash on
his arms, which made him even more depressed. It was like some biblical curse.
How had my son become like the Egyptians, inflicted with "blotches and
blains" by an angry Jehovah? I began worrying that he was going to kill himself
for real now, and I stayed home from work several days to watch over him
when he seemed particularly despairing. When I did go to work, Lin and I
called him several times a day.


But then another seeming miracle. I took him to my regular doctor to treat
the rash, and he prescribed a steroid, which got rid of not only the rash but the
depression. Steroids contain hormones, and apparently the one prescribed for
the rash jump-started Charley's neurons--"It's all electricity, anyway," as one of
his therapists said--and kicked him out of the down mood. Or maybe it was
his recovery from the rash; convalescence can be a sort of resurrection.
Whatever it was, within a few days he seemed fine. "I'm feeling a lot better,
Dad," he said when I hadn't even asked, and with a smile I knew was genuine.
He started seeing the therapist recommended by Dr. Gray, a doctorate in psychology
with a license in marriage and family counseling named Barbara Blum
whose office was only a few blocks from my apartment. He continued having
half sessions with Dr. Gray every two weeks to adjust his medication. Dr. Gray
put him on another antidepressant, Zoloft, to replace the Wellbutrin and sent
him to St. John's every month to check his lithium level. The bifurcated
therapy seemed to work. Charley now had a second set of parents taking care
of him, Lin and I commented to each other--Dr. Gray his therapeutic father,
Dr. Blum his therapeutic mother. With so much parenting he would have to get
better, if only in self-defense.

<b>A Layman's Guide to Major Mental Illness</b>


<b>Sertraline:</b> Brand name: <b><i>Zoloft</i></b>


<b>Pharmacology:</b> Antidepressant. The antidepressant effect of sertraline
<b><i>is presumed</i></b> to be linked to its ability to inhibit the neuronal reuptake of serotonin.
It has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal
reuptake. At clinical doses, sertraline blocks the uptake of serotonin into human
platelets.... Like most clinically effective antidepressants, sertraline downregulates
brain norepinephrine and serotonin receptors <b><i>in animals</i></b>. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_68289');">[note]</a><div id="_note_68289" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">5 <i><a href="www.mentalhealth.com">www.mentalhealth.com</a></i>, 1999.</div> (emphasis

Charley's sudden recovery thrilled me, and made me think I knew what his
problem was. By now I had observed his behavior for more than two years. I
had seen him crazily manic (more than seen, I'd <i>felt</i> the mania, the buzz the
weekend after Yosemite). More recently I had seen him in his "postpsychotic
depression" (Dr. Gray's term), which had come after Christmas when the
autumn mania abated; Charley had been suicidal, but "rationally" suicidal. And
now I had seen his sudden emergence out of the depression. None of this
sounded to me like schizophrenia, which I had read is marked by steady, long-term
deterioration. Charley's condition was just the opposite; it was all over the
place. Further, the symptoms seemed to be mood driven, coming and going
with his ups and downs. The psychotic thinking was not "autonomous," in
other words. He didn't think he was Franz Liszt when he was depressed, only
when he was manic. Similarly with his romantic fixations; they came with his
grandiose highs and went away with his lows. So even though Dr. Gray was
unwilling to diagnose Charley as one thing or the other, I thought I was starting
to get a clearer picture of what was wrong.


To explain my thinking at the time I need to discuss, briefly, some current
psychiatric theory. For those who wish to go into the matter more thoroughly,
I have written a fuller account and added it as Appendix C.


Presently, psychiatry distinguishes three major mental illnesses: (1) schizophrenia,
(2) manic-depressive (or bipolar) disorder, and (3) major depression, that is,
unipolar depression (depression without mania). Lately, (2) and (3) are tending to
be lumped together into a single category, major mood disorder, as opposed to
the <i>thought</i> disorder schizophrenia. This axiomatic distinction between thought
and mood (also called "affect") is important in psychiatry. Schizophrenia, which

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The theory has problems, however. For one thing, the distinction between
thought and mood and their respective malfunctions is often not clear-cut. The
way people feel affects how they think as well as the other way around, and it
is not always clear which comes first. In practical terms, people with mood disorder
often manifest the same kinds of disordered thinking as people with
thought disorder. For example, people with extreme manic-depression often
present exactly the same psychotic symptoms as schizophrenics do--delusions,
hearing voices, thoughts that one is Jesus Christ, being talked to by God. The
difference, psychiatric research has determined, is that for manic-depressives
these symptoms are mood-driven and temporary, changing with the cycles of
mania and depression. Also--this is another important distinction--people suffering
from mood disorder experience periods of spontaneous recovery and
normality and more or less regular functioning, whereas symptoms of
schizophrenia last six months or longer. Untreated schizophrenics, and even
some treated ones--treatment here referring to antipsychotic medications--
are considered doomed to a permanent deterioration in their mental state and
quality of life. This is because, more and more, psychiatry defines major mental
illness and even many secondary personality disorders (attention deficit disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, alcoholism and so on) as "brain
diseases," neurological disorders caused by (probably genetic) malfunctions or
imbalances of brain chemistry or even brain structure. This view of mental illnesses
as physical brain diseases that can be treated (although not cured) with
antipsychotic drugs has achieved the status of conventional wisdom.


Even if the brain-disease theory is true, however--and for a long time I
accepted it as true--there are holes in it. For one thing, there is no direct physical
way of observing schizophrenia or manic-depression, no germ or virus or
damaged gene that can be seen under a microscope or through X rays or blood
tests. Although certain patients diagnosed as schizophrenics have (often minor

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A good indication of how little is still known about mental illness is what
the research establishment itself says. Recently I read a document on
schizophrenia on the National Institute of Mental Health Web site. NIMH is
the mental health division of the federal government's National Institutes of
Health, the prime public funder of mental health research. To the question "Is
schizophrenia caused by a physical abnormality in the brain?" NIMH replies:
<blockquote>
<p>
Many studies of people with schizophrenia have found abnormalities in
brain structure (for example, enlargement of the fluid-filled cavities, called the
ventricles, in the interior of the brain, and decreased size of certain brain
regions) or function (for example, decreased metabolic activity in certain brain
regions). It should be emphasized that these abnormalities are quite subtle and
are not characteristic of <i>all</i> people with schizophrenia, nor do they occur <i>only</i>
in individuals with this illness. Microscopic studies of brain tissue after death
have also shown small changes in distribution or number of brain cells in people
with schizophrenia. It appears that many (but probably not all) of these changes
are present before an individual becomes ill, and schizophrenia may be, in part,
a disorder in development of the brain. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_77049');">[note]</a><div id="_note_77049" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">8 <i><a href="www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/schizoph">www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/schizoph</a></i>.</div> (emphasis in the original)

Notice the tentativeness of the language, the qualifications: "Quite subtle,"
"not characteristic of all," "nor do they occur only," "small changes," "it appears,"
"may be, in part," etc. The language gets even more tentative in answer to the
next question, "How is it treated?" The answer begins, "<i>Since schizophrenia may
not be a single condition</i> and its causes are not yet known, current treatment methods
are based on both clinical research and experience." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_77699');">[note]</a><div id="_note_77699" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">9 Ibid.</div> (emphasis added)

"<i>Since schizophrenia may not be a single condition</i> and its causes are not yet
known..."This seems to indicate a fairly gaping hole in the conventional wisdom
that "everybody knows" that schizophrenia is a brain disease. So if it "may
not be a single condition," what is it? It is the diagnosis of last resort, the diagnosis
arrived at after all other <i>observable</i> and <i>verifiable</i> possibilities have been
ruled out. Before arriving at a diagnosis of schizophrenia, NIMH says, "It is
important to rule out other illnesses, as sometimes people suffer severe mental
symptoms or even psychosis due to undetected underlying medical conditions"
--like brain injury or tumor, certain vitamin deficiencies or allergic
reactions, sleep deprivation, and so on--which, by implication, schizophrenia
is not. What is it? A skeptic might say that "schizophrenia" is Greek for "none
of the above." It is the abominable snowman of illnesses. It <i>must</i> exist--we've
heard the stories and seen the footprints--but, well....


Much of the uncertainty surrounding schizophrenia also goes for manic-depression.
It too is a condition that exists not in any kind of concrete, verifiable
form--virus, bacteria, lesion, damaged gene, chemical imbalance (such as
too little insulin in diabetics)--but as a collection of symptoms. Some of them,
like cyclicity, are a little less amorphous than the symptoms of schizophrenia.
Some of them, like hearing voices and hallucinating (in the more extreme
manias), are exactly the same, which is why the two conditions are often mistaken
for each other.


The theoretical uncertainties regarding mental illness have practical consequences.
In the absence of positive medical tests for the various disorders, they
are still defined (and diagnosed) not as specific physical conditions but as complexes
of symptoms (for example, heightened mood, irritability, hallucinations,
paranoia, obsessive behavior) as observed by clinicians or described by the
patients themselves. And because many of these illnesses have overlapping
symptoms, making a differential diagnosis (for example, telling schizophrenia
from manic-depression) is a two-step process. First a psychiatrist makes a preliminary
diagnosis by observing a patient's symptoms and behaviors and trying
to match them against lists of criteria for the various defined mental illnesses
in the bible of psychiatry, the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders</i>. Then he or she prescribes a medication that matches the preliminary
diagnosis: an antipsychotic if it looks like schizophrenia, lithium or an equivalent
if it looks like manic-depression, Prozac or another antidepressant if it

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Diagnosis of mental illness, in other words, is made by reasoning <i>backward</i>,
from treatment to disease. This is the reverse of general medical practice.
Usually the disease determines the treatment. In psychiatry the treatment
determines the disease. I saw this in the way Dr. Gray treated Charley. "This is
not rocket science," he said once to Charley and me as we were trying to figure
out what medications to give him. "It's mainly a process of trial and error."
Trial and error based on observation over time--and a lot of drugs. For long
periods, Charley took medications for all three major mental illnesses simultaneously,
which seems to reduce to absurdity one of the big selling points of the
brain-disease model, its supposed scientific precision--namely, that by defining
mental illnesses as physical conditions and then "differentially diagnosing"
which one a person has, psychiatrists can prescribe specific drugs for the specific
disease and cut out unnecessary treatments--not only other drugs but
labor-intensive and pricey talk therapy as well, which supposedly doesn't help
with brain diseases. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_82654');">[note]</a><div id="_note_82654" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">10 The brain-diseasers don't rule out <i>all</i> psychotherapy, as I will talk about
later, but they narrow it down, sometimes insistently (as I will also talk
about later), to basically helping the person cope with having a brain disease
and having to take often unpleasant and "stigmatizing" medications.
Psychotherapy, in other words, is at best a subsidiary treatment, and thus the
first to go when something has to be cut back.</div>


In the spring of 1993, however, when Charley's suicidal depression suddenly
lifted, I thought I had grasped the essence of his illness--that it was mood
driven--and was thus in a position to help him and his doctors focus on how
to deal with it.


<b>Delirious Mania</b>


Convinced that his condition was a mood disorder, I decided to read up on
manic-depression. I put aside my materials on schizophrenia and bought the

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As soon as I started reading <i>Manic-Depressive Illness</i> I felt a sense of relief. Yes,
this was Charley, I thought. He wasn't schizophrenic, whatever that meant. I was
particularly excited by the early, descriptive parts of the huge book, which
included first-person accounts of people's experiences with mania and depression,
experiences that included the most extreme psychotic symptoms: hearing
voices, having delusions and hallucinations, thinking one was God. Much of the
description matched almost exactly what had happened to Charley, and I kept
underlining passages and showing them to him, hoping they would register
with him, too, and make him see that what was wrong was not as shapeless and
mysterious as he (we) had feared, that he was not floating alone in some indefinable
nebula. Wouldn't knowing that he had a serious but <i>knowable</i> condition--
and one shared by other valuable, creative people like Robert Lowell and
Byron and van Gogh--strengthen his resolve to go on? One passage in particular
impressed me. It is attributed to "a patient" but was actually written by
coauthor Jamison herself, who a few years after <i>Manic-Depressive Illness</i> was
published wrote an autobiography, <i>An Unquiet Mind</i>, in which she came out of
the closet as having herself suffered from manic-depressive illness for years. The
writing sounds very much like passages in Charley's journal blended with the
expressions of despair ("Oh Father, Father...") uttered as we sat on the futon
in late February, two nights before he cut his wrists:
<blockquote>
<p>
There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror involved in
this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings
are fast and frequent like shooting stars and you follow them until you find better
and brighter ones. Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly
there, the power to seduce and captivate others a felt certainty.... But, somewhere,
this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast and there are far too many;
overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption

moving with the grain is now against--you are irritable, angry, frightened, and
uncontrollable, and enmeshed totally in the blackest caves of the mind. You
never knew those caves were there. It will never end. Madness carves its own
reality. It goes on and on and finally there are only others' recollections of your
behaviors....What then, after the medications, psychiatrist, despair, depression,
and overdose....What did I do? Why? And most hauntingly, when will it happen
again? Then, too, are the annoyances--medicine to take, resent, forget, take,
resent, and forget, but always to take.... And always, when will it happen again?

A few pages later Goodwin and Jamison describe a particularly extreme
condition, Bell's mania, also known as <i>delirious mania</i>,
<blockquote>
<p>

When Bell described the syndrome in the mid-19th century, he
noted its sudden onset, severe insomnia, loss of appetite, disorientation, paranoia,

They cite other authorities on delirious mania:
<blockquote>

clouded, illusions and hallucinations may be observed, and the condition may
resemble a delirium. These states are seriously debilitating and may endanger
life. <i>Sleep</i> is severely disturbed in these graver psychoses, but it is also shortened
in the milder forms. Another bodily symptom is the exhaustion which supervenes
on months of hyper-activity and reduced sleep. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_88571');">[note]</a><div id="_note_88571" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">13 W.

Kraepelin, I thought as I read this, could have been describing the more
extreme forms of Charley's god consciousness. And I wasn't the only one

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wanted to cry out in thanks as I read this--not (obviously) because I was
glad Charley had an extreme and life-threatening condition, but because we
finally seemed to know what it was. Most important of all, as his library search
showed, Charley finally seemed to be doing his own independent investigation,
taking charge of his own life.


The encouragement I got from reading Goodwin and Jamison's book didn't
end there. Another one of their findings, which corresponded to what I had
observed in Charley, is that mania and depression are not as opposite and
mutually exclusive as the idea of "bipolar" might indicate. Rather, they accompany
each other in what psychiatry calls "mixed states." Another description
attributed to "one patient" but in fact written by Jamison herself talks about
this:
<blockquote>
<p>
I have felt infinitely worse, more dangerously depressed, when manic than
when in the midst of my worst depressions. In fact, the most awful I have ever
felt in my entire life... was the first time I was manic. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_91351');">[note]</a><div id="_note_91351" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">15 Ibid., 27.</div>

As I read this I began to think back on Charley's anxiety attacks after
Yosemite, how different they had seemed from what one normally thinks of as
mania or elation. Now I was beginning to see why. In one particularly clear
passage that I not only underlined but double-asterisked and showed to
Charley, Goodwin and Jamison quote other researchers as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>
It would appear that the traditional conception of mania and depression as representing
"opposite" pathologic extremes of affective expression is simplistic and
reductionist in several ways. While most depressive states share the common affect
of sadness, mania appears to be not as well characterized by elation but rather by
a state of heightened overall activation, with enhanced affective expression

Yes, exactly! It sounded so much like what Charley had manifested the
weekend after Yosemite: the elation turning to anxiety, the panic attacks, the
crying, the descent into near immobility. They were all part of the same manic
episode. Mania didn't mean merely elation. It meant extreme sensitivity, overworked
nerves quivering at the edge of their functioning, crackling and quivering,
then suddenly going dead as the circuit breaker flips off. Years later,
when I read his journal, many passages (some of which I quoted earlier)
seemed to speak to the same mixed states: elation and a sense of his own supernal
talent, his genius, existing at the same moment with fear and self-doubt.
("<i>My talent, hah! How can I flatter myself so? Where is the proof?</i>")


The final proof for me that Charley was manic-depressive was the connection
Goodwin and Jamison draw between manic-depression and creativity--
the fact, known and written about at least since Plato, that there is some kind
of link between madness and artistic talent, particularly poetry and music.
Throughout history, a disproportionate number of artists and other important
historical figures--too many to be explained by the laws of probability alone--
have suffered from mood disorders of varying severity, either manic-depression
or unipolar depression. Artists, particularly musicians and poets, have also suffered
from a larger than normal incidence of suicide. Although many of these
creative people who went insane (like van Gogh) used to be called schizophrenic,
Goodwin and Jamison and others now claim that historically
schizophrenia has been overdiagnosed and manic-depressive underdiagnosed,
and that actually van Gogh and other "madmen" were manic-depressive.


Exactly, I thought--Charley, too! He too was initially assumed to be
schizophrenic--by Gayle at Ryles and Dr. Gray, among others--because of his
"thought disorder" symptoms. But they had been wrong. I was sure of it.


From the time of Yosemite, when I thought Charley was in shock from the
car crash, until now, I had been sure that his breakdowns were the result of a
physical condition. I didn't know whether it was caused by temporary insomnia,
drugs, some underlying instability or chemical imbalance, or a combination. But

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This both comforted and inspired me. Scary and life-threatening as manic-depressive
illness was, especially the extreme form Charley had, compared with
schizophrenia it was by far the lesser of two evils, especially because it was
treatable by the relatively benign lithium (one of the natural elements) rather
than the hated Navane or other neuroleptics. Everything is relative. If you have
to have a major mental illness, I thought, better manic-depression than
schizophrenia. All Charley had to do was take his lithium and he would have
a long and almost normal life.


<b>The Muse Is a Harsh Mistress</b>


Artists are the raw nerve ends of humanity.


<i>(My godfather, the painter Jimmy Ernst)</i>


Selling the idea to Charley, however, was not as easy as selling it to myself.


Especially since the early nineteenth century, the links between mood disorders
and creativity have given us the popular image of the artist dying young,
the suffering and tormented youth hanging from a cross whose vertical beam is
genius, the horizontal beam disease, arrayed against a backdrop of societal misunderstanding.
In the United States the doomed young artist or rock musician
too sensitive for this world--the James Dean or Janis Joplin or Jim Morrison or
River Phoenix or Kurt Cobain, our modern-day Byrons and Shelleys, shooting
stars who streak across the sky with a burst of glory and then disappear, but not

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I hoped not, and I argued the opposite position with him using all the reason
and rhetoric I could muster. Although talent and mood disorder, or even
madness, coexist in some artists, I said, whether one <i>causes</i> the other, and, if so,
which causes which, is less clear. Many great artists are not manic-depressive,
and most manic-depressives are not great artists. You can have one without the
other. An artist can still be an artist and take medication if it's necessary to keep
him alive. He can live a healthy life of good nutrition and exercise and minimal
booze and dope and still be creative. Look at Michelangelo, or Bach, or
Robert Frost, or Mark Twain or your beloved Tolstoy, I pleaded. They all died
old. You can have your cake and eat it too. Stick around, boy.


But while I was mouthing one bakery metaphor he was hearing another:
"half a loaf." I sounded like a dull old father who'd had his fun and now wanted
to spoil everybody else's, especially his son's. And when years later I looked at
his journals, particularly the early ones in which he was writing under the
influence of his pre-Yosemite hypomanic flights of fancy, I could see why. His
proclamations about being a genius, a great writer or concert pianist, seemed
inextricably bound up with his highs. It was as if the highs gave him not only
the energy but the self-confidence, the emotional propulsion, that he needed
to strive to create. Like many people who experience mania, Charley was
always worrying that what he called his "excursions" were connected to his talents,
particularly in music and poetry, and that if he took his lithium (which,
as we shall see, flattened out his moods), if he became "normalized," his talent
would disappear.


"Your talent will also disappear if you're <i>dead</i>" I kept replying.


Like so many irrefutable arguments, this one made no impression whatsoever.
Charley's condition--his illness or (as he himself called it) his "affliction"--
seemed too basic to not only his artistic but his human identity to give
up easily, even if such a thing was possible. Can a comet decide one day to
become a fixed star? Like all metaphors, this one threatens to hide more than
it reveals, with perhaps fatal consequences. But let us keep it in the back of our
minds anyway, as I think Charley did.


And not just Charley. "Which of the me's is me?" Kay Jamison asks, echoing
the plaint of the person buffeted by wild swings of feeling and experience. This

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Like the equation of madness with love and poetry, the notion that madness
is divine, a kind of higher sanity, also goes back at least to the time of Plato. In
its modern form of romanticism, the cult of individual sensibility originating
in the Enlightenment, madness is equated with nonconformity. The madman
is a variant of the noble savage, Rousseau's natural man driven to extremes by
bourgeois tyranny and convention. He only seems mad; it's really the world
that's mad. Weren't Byron or Beethoven thought to be mad? and Galileo? How
many times have we heard that "So-and-so"--fill in the name of some
genius--"was thought to be mad in his day"? In this view, calling eccentric or
rebellious behavior "mental illness" is a way of marginalizing and delegitimizing
rebellion or innovation--or of contemptuously dismissing those who psychologically
implode under the pressures of "success" and the demands of the
rat race. The pseudoscientific vocabulary of psychiatry is the enabling ideological
legislation a repressive society uses (verbally, at first) to isolate and quarantine
its rebels and denigrate its "weaker" members--those people, often the
raw nerve ends, who short out under the power overload of a system that purports
to be natural (as social Darwinism and its modern variations claim) but
is really totally unnatural. But from the "psychiatric" <i>words</i>--mental illness,
brain disease, genetic defect, gravely disabled, danger to himself and others--
the psychiatric <i>wards</i>, with their locks and straitjackets and forced medication
and electroconvulsive therapy and lobotomies, are soon constructed.


In a society that has elevated buying not only to a state religion but to a
moral imperative ("Economists fear that a slow Christmas season could lead to
recession"), a society that only half-jokingly refers to the workings of the stock
exchange--the state church--as the battle between "fear and greed," such
arguments are not entirely unconvincing.

<b>Who's Crazy?</b>


A January 7, 2000, article in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> titled "Hey, Baby
Boomers Need Their Space, Okay? Look at All Their Stuff" talks about how
there was a 10 percent growth in the size of the average American home during
the 1990s bull market. "Like the American waistline, the new American
home is getting larger," <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_105007');">[note]</a><div id="_note_105007" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">18 Carlos Tejada and Patrick Barta, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, 7 January 2000,
sec. A, 1.</div> the article reports, citing the luxury home market in
particular, which has among other things produced twenty-foot-high ceilings
and double-decker walk-in closets with clothing racks ten feet above the floor.
"If you're ten feet tall they're great," says Diane Bean, a woman "of average
height" who has such a closet (and a hard time reaching her own clothes). <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_105491');">[note]</a><div id="_note_105491" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">19 Ibid.</div>Others with similar homes acknowledge that they don't really need all the
stuff. A forty-three-year-old New York garment executive named Michael
Levine, for instance, bought a five-thousand-square-foot house with a conservatory
"as well as a spacious, well-appointed kitchen. ‘Not that anybody cooks,
but it looks impressive.’" <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_105853');">[note]</a><div id="_note_105853" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">20 Ibid., sec. A, 6.</div> Musical instruments, as well as gourmet stoves and
refrigerators, have become status symbols. Levine "wants to put a piano in his
living room, though the room otherwise won't see much use. ‘Do I need one?
I don't need one,’ he says." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_106133');">[note]</a><div id="_note_106133" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">21 Ibid.</div>


Even the people who build the luxury homes are becoming queasy. The
<i>Journal:</i>
<blockquote>

"Does anybody need all this? No," says Robert Toll, chief executive officer
of Toll Brothers Inc., the nation's largest high-end homebuilder.... To Houston

already consumes 35 to 40 percent of the world's resources. Meanwhile a billion

than half the world's population live on two dollars a day. Is it really unfair to

Given these parallels, the "brain-disease" model of psychosis, whatever else
it may or may not be, is certainly a useful social bulwark against the temptation
to analyze that parallelism too closely. After all, the guy in the alley has a

Right?


<b>Madness: Divine or Not? Two Views</b>


Soon after Charley's first breakdown I came across a book called <i>Tlie Loony-Bin
Trip</i>, by Kate Millett. It was at a time when Lin and I, and Charley, were
wrestling with the question of how to treat his condition, whether it was physicochemical
or spiritual, and particularly whether he should take medication or not,
I taking the position that he should. The description on <i>The Loony-Bin Trip</i>s back
cover said that its author was a diagnosed manic-depressive, and the blurb on the
front described the book as "the courageous story of a fiercely independent
mind" and a "radical call for new tolerance toward mental states that are ‘at the
margin’--from flights of artistic inspiration to states of altered consciousness."


I bought the book, read a few pages, and put it back on the shelf for six and

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>The Loony-Bin Trip</i> is Kate Millett's account of her decision to stop taking
lithium in 1980 after being on it for more than six years following an episode
diagnosed as manic-depression in 1973. Going off lithium led to a resumption
of her mania--which she basically refuses to call an illness (and which, in fact,
sounds like a much milder type than Charley's). Millett's refusal to resume taking
lithium resulted in conflicts with family and friends, and later in her forced
hospitalization. Eventually freed, Millett fell into a major depression, and out of
desperation went back on lithium voluntarily. Later she went off it again and
when she wrote <i>The Loony-Bin Trip</i> (published in 1990) she had not suffered any
further breaks.


In <i>The Loony-Bin Trip</i>, Millett, a lifelong radical with a particularly strong
interest in civil liberties, argues that the idea of mental illness is a social construct
developed and used by a repressive society to control people who are different
or who pose a threat to the sociopolitical hierarchy. In the book's preface she
says she is telling her story of hospitalization and coerced medication to "help
all those who have been or are about to be in the same boat, those captured and
shaken by this bizarre system of beliefs: the general superstition of ‘mental disease,’
the physical fact of incarceration and compulsory drugs...." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_111615');">[note]</a><div id="_note_111615" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">23 Kate Millett, <i>The Loony-Bin Trip</i>, (New York: Touchstone [Simon &amp;
Schuster], 1990), 11.</div>


Millett's decision to stop taking lithium had both a personal (physical) component
and a sociopolitical one. She made the decision even though taking the
lithium had helped her get out of the prison of psychiatric hospitalization.
"Then why quit taking lithium? Six years of diarrhea. Six years of hand tremor
in public places, on podiums, at receptions, at the moment one is watched and
observed." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_112151');">[note]</a><div id="_note_112151" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">24 Ibid., 31.</div> Later she talks about the shame and humiliation of forced hospitalization,
the feeling of helplessness it engenders in the imprisoned person,
especially since those doing the imprisoning--loved ones and doctors--are
convinced they are doing it for the person's own good. Such benign tyranny
can be especially hard to fight because it engenders doubt and guilt in the
mind of the prisoner, a sort of Stockholm syndrome whereby the prisoner
begins to collude in the imprisonment and the medication regimen that comes
as a condition of release. For Millett, lithium "represented collusion; when I
stopped I was no longer cooperating in some social and emotional way" <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_112859');">[note]</a><div id="_note_112859" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">25 Ibid., 94-5.</div>


Millett defends mania and a person's right to experience it, claiming that the

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For we could enjoy mania if we were permitted to by the others around us so
distressed by it, if the thing were so arranged that manics were safe to be manic
awhile without reproach or contradiction, the thwarting and harassment on
every side that finally exasperates them so they lose their tempers and are cross,
offensive, defensive, antagonistic--all they are accused of being. A manic permitted
to think ten thousand miles a minute is happy and harmless and could,
if encouraged and given time, perhaps be productive as well. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_113918');">[note]</a><div id="_note_113918" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">26 Ibid., 72.</div>


Millett's demedicalization of mania extends to depression also. It is not some
disease of the brain, but an internalization of the world's disapproval, "a hangover
of penitence and self-renunciation, that complicity with social disapproval...."
But, she says, "Wait a moment--why call this depression?--why not
call it grief? You've permitted your grief, even your outrage, to be converted
into a disease. You have allowed your overwhelming, seemingly inexplicable
grief at what has been done to you--the trauma and shame of imprisonment--
to be transformed into a mysterious psychosis. How could you?" <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_114591');">[note]</a><div id="_note_114591" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">27 Ibid., 309.</div>


Although I didn't (and don't) agree with all of Millett's views, it was still impossible
for me to read <i>The Loony-Bin Trip</i> while Charley was alive. Her angry, pitying
accounts of her well-meaning but clueless friends, relatives and lovers who
loved her so much they couldn't wait to stick her in the nuthouse and drug her
up reminded me too much of myself at the times when Charley was breaking
down and I was forced, or thought I was forced, to become his jailer. Her position,
like Charley's, basically boiled down to, I'll be okay if you just stop bothering
me. And I was answering him with exactly the same mix of concern and
condescension that Millett's family and friends had used on her. At the same time,
though, Charley had very nearly killed himself, and would again, for reasons that
had nothing to do with parental or psychiatric meddling, so he was not simply a
"happy and harmless" eccentric wandering amiably in the sun-dappled gardens of
his own mind. Thus I continually felt wind-sheared between my inclination to let
him alone and my fear of what leaving him alone might lead to. No wonder <i>The
Loony-Bin Trip</i> made me uncomfortable.


Soon after I finally read it all the way through more than a year after

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At first glance the two women couldn't be more different. Millett is dark-eyed,
black Irish, left-wing, and a lesbian, a defender of Northern Irish political
prisoners and other marginalized groups, strongly antimedication and
antihospitalization. Jamison is the Establishment candidate, a blonde-haired
scion of an upper-middle-class WASP military family, the good daughter who
literally wrote the book (cowrote it, anyway) on manic-depressive illness, apolitical
and openly heterosexual (with a predilection for slim and handsome
upper-crust Englishmen).Whereas Millett hates lithium, Jamison credits it with
saving her life. Whereas Millett condemns psychiatric hospitals as instruments
of social control, Jamison worked in such a hospital for years before becoming
a professor of medicine at that East Coast bastion of straightitude, Johns
Hopkins University.


But scratch the surface and commonalities appear. Millett is an artist, both a
writer and a creator of pen-and-ink drawings. Jamison is also a writer, one whose
particular interest is in art and the creative process, particularly the link between
mood and creativity. Although she swears by lithium and credits it with saving
her life, she also suffered years of demoralizing side effects at least as bad as
Millett's--"severe nausea and vomiting many times a month," occasional ataxia
(inability to control muscle movements), slurred speech, and, most important, a
loss of concentration and memory. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_118177');">[note]</a><div id="_note_118177" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">28 Kay Redfield Jamison, <i>An Unquiet Mind</i> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 93-5.</div> From the '70s to the late '80s the standard
of medical practice changed, however (Jamison does not explain why), and
psychiatrists found that patients could be maintained on less lithium, with correspondingly
milder side effects. This led her to reduce her own dosage--very
carefully, because she was terrified of having a recurrence of mania.


The effect was dramatic. It was as though I had taken bandages off my eyes
after many years of partial blindness.... I realized that my steps were literally

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1001070234-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Not exactly a panegyric to lithium. Jamison is even more ambivalent about
psychiatric hospitalization. Although she herself worked in a psych ward for
years and routinely locked people up, she refused to be locked up herself during
a severe depression that followed a manic episode caused by going off
lithium. Her psychiatrist, afraid she was about to attempt suicide,
<blockquote>
<p>
repeatedly tried to persuade me to go into a psychiatric hospital, but I refused.
I was horrified at the thought of being locked up; being away from familiar surroundings;
having to attend group therapy meetings; and having to put up with
all of the indignities and invasions of privacy that go into being on a psychiatric
ward. I was working on a locked ward at the time, and I didn't relish the idea
of not having the key. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_120107');">[note]</a><div id="_note_120107" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">30 Ibid., 112.</div>

Jamison resisted being locked up, in other words, for exactly the same reasons
anybody, including Kate Millett and Charley, resists being locked up. Not
exactly a ringing endorsement of current psychiatric practice. A sense of irony
is not one of Jamison's strong points, and she does not seem to notice the "do
as I say, not as I do" nature of her position. A cynic could simply term it
hypocrisy and ask how comfortable one would be going to a restaurant whose
owner prefers to eat somewhere else. But that may not be entirely fair. Where
Millett dwells on the liberating possibilities of mania, Jamison, speaking of
research she did while coauthoring <i>Manic-Depressive Illness</i>, says,
<blockquote>
<p>
Time and again, because of both personal and clinical experiences, I found
myself emphasizing the terrible lethality of manic-depressive illness, the dreadful
agitation involved in mixed manic states, and the importance of dealing with
patients' reluctance to take lithium or other medications to control their
moods. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_121220');">[note]</a><div id="_note_121220" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">31 Ibid., 166.</div>

moods. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_121220');">[note]</a><div id="_note_121220" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">31 Ibid., 166.</div>


Despite her own problems with lithium and resistance to being hospitalized,
Jamison is openly contemptuous of the antimedicationists. She has no tolerance,
she says,

for those individuals--especially psychiatrists and psychologists--who oppose
using medications for psychiatric illnesses; those clinicians who somehow draw
a distinction between the suffering and treatability of "medical illnesses" such as
Hodgkin's disease or breast cancer, and psychiatric illnesses such as depression,
manic-depression, or schizophrenia. I believe, without doubt, that manic-depressive
illness is a medical illness; I also believe that, with rare exceptions, it
is malpractice to treat it without medication. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_122156');">[note]</a><div id="_note_122156" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">32 Ibid., 102.</div>


There is, then, an irreducible difference between Jamison and Millett's positions.
Still, Jamison is hardly some Orwellian lobotomist, some clanging sledgehammer
of patriarchy. She has spent years researching and writing about the
links between mood disorders and creativity, delving into what she calls the
"positive features of mania and cyclothymia." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_122584');">[note]</a><div id="_note_122584" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">33 Ibid., 204. <i>Cyclothymia</i> means "mood swings."</div> In the epilogue to <i>An Unquiet
Mind</i> she even refuses to say that she would have been better off not being
manic-depressive. "I have often asked myself whether, given the choice, I
would choose to have manic-depressive illness," she remarks (imagine asking a
similar question about Hodgkin's disease or breast cancer!), then continues,
<blockquote>
<p>
If lithium were not available to me, or didn't work for me, the answer would be
a simple no--and it would be an answer laced with terror. But lithium does
work for me, and therefore I suppose I can afford to pose the question. Strangely
enough I think I would choose to have it.... I honestly believe that as a result
of it I have felt more things, more deeply; had more experiences, more
intensely; loved more, and been more loved.... <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_123467');">[note]</a><div id="_note_123467" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">34 Ibid., 217-18.</div>
</p>
</blockquote>
Not so utterly different from Millett's defense of mania. How many other diseases
would one choose to have under <i>any</i> circumstances?

And how hard to treat. The positive side of manic-depressive illness is more
than an intriguing philosophical question. It becomes a practical matter when
a person is faced with having to take medications that alleviate the worst
aspects of depression but also tamp down the highs, the bursts of creativity, the
enhanced sexuality, the feelings of oneness with the world. Imagine trying to
convince a person to have chemotherapy not for a short time but every day for
the rest of their life when their cancer, instead of making them feel awful,
either has no symptoms at all most of the time or else makes them feel good--
or better than good--a lot of the time. How long would the person put up
with the nausea and hand tremors and hair loss? Continuing to take lithium

And no wonder the issue of lithium (and, generally, medication) compliance
is such a huge one. Even Kay Redfield Jamison, with all her education and
medical background and broad support network, waged a "war with lithium" <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_125323');">[note]</a><div id="_note_125323" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">35 Ibid., 92.</div>that almost killed her. "Psychological issues ultimately proved far more important
than side effects in my prolonged resistance to lithium," she says. "I simply
did not want to believe that I needed to take medication." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_125580');">[note]</a><div id="_note_125580" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">36 Ibid., 98.</div> It was only after
years of conflict and bouts of mania and depression that she finally realized that
for her the choice "was between madness and sanity, and between life and
death." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_125801');">[note]</a><div id="_note_125801" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">37 Ibid., 102.</div> Contrast this with Millett's account of going off lithium entirely. It
points, I think, to the enormous variability of people's individual situations and
experiences, their psychologies and physiologies and needs. Brain chemistry
and the problems of the mind simply do not exist on the same plane as tumors
or clogged arteries or diseased lungs or kidneys.


If Kay Jamison's "it's a matter of life and death" starkness does not correspond
to Kate Millett's experience, however, it does I think speak to Charley's,
at least as his life was evolving after more than two years of breakdowns and
recoveries. If there was ever any doubt that his condition and treatment problems
were life-and-death matters, that doubt would disappear for good the
second spring after his Thanksgiving breakdown, the spring of a year that
started with such promise.
