Transcript:
<b>DR:</b> So very good.  So it's just kind of amazing that the Methylin give you the exact effect that you got with the, uh —
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  And, and that's why you want the Strattera?
<b>PT:</b> That's why I went for the Strattera when doc, the other doctor, um —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> He [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Uh, when I moved here I was originally on Neurontin and Zyprexa.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And that was it.  And, um, because the ADHD, and nobody had focused on it other than back then, he focused on it, and instead of switching me Abilify right away, which is where I was going to switch in California.  But they told me to wait until I got to my new doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> They were going to switch me already.  Take me off the Zyprexa and Neurontin.  So he did the Strattera, and I've been on it since I've been here.  So it's been 2003.
<b>DR:</b> I see.  And since 2003 until now, we, we, we upped the dose to 18 mg.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  We upped the dose, and twice it's been upped.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, we, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And that's where I've been at right now.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I probably could do better probably on something else but [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You don't want anything other than certain.  That's what you want for your son, too.  You don't want him to be on it.
<b>PT:</b> If, if he, if Strattera does not work on him —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's like my, my nephew.  He used it for a while and it stopped working.  If it does not work on him, then, fine.  I'm willing to do something that will work because I don't want him to be like me.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want him to have to cope and learn how to deal with it.  If there is something I stop him and help him be better, then fine.  But I wanted to try the non narcotic avenue first.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Before putting drugs in his system.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But if that can't happen —
<b>DR:</b> And, and he, and he —
<b>PT:</b> But if that came down to it.  If it came down and he needed Ritalin, I would not be against that, 100% against it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Because he didn't go through the substance abuse like yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly, exactly.  He doesn't know the feeling of, of one.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, let me look through this.  Uh, uh, are this?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's the ADHD part?
<b>PT:</b> Hum?  Oh.
<b>DR:</b> Write your name here and my name here.  And write your name here.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  [PREAMBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Smile, it's free.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, uh, what else?  So how are things going at home, otherwise?  You are, you and your mom, how?  And your sister is still, is, is your sister, is she still home?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> She's home.  She's still there right now.  I think she goes in Sunday.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And it's, it's going.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> We're a family.  We share everything.
<b>DR:</b> And has it been going all right?
<b>PT:</b> Best it can.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Your nephew is at home, too?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> How, how is he doing with you?  I mean, is he, does he consider you —
<b>PT:</b> He's a good kid.
<b>DR:</b> He's a good kid for you, too?
<b>PT:</b> He is, he's a good kid.  He has his issues, we all do.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I had my issues at that age, too.
<b>DR:</b> Like what?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, things [INAUDIBLE].  Actually, he's never got as bad as I did, but he's, he's got the same thing.  He can't sit still, he can't.  You know, his meds help them.  Thank God he's got them.
<b>DR:</b> So right.  What you, would you say that you have the genes for ADHD?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's in the family.
<b>DR:</b> It's, it's in the family?
<b>PT:</b> It's in the family.  I was very, uh, one of my cousin's mother's, she's one of those parents, "Not my kid."
<b>DR:</b> I see.
<b>PT:</b> She's too, she's too high up here, of herself, to admit that there's something there.  My mom has seen my cousin, I've got a couple cousins that exhibit —
<b>DR:</b> So what?  Um—hum.  ADHD symptoms?
<b>PT:</b> ADHD, yeah.  And their parents won't even look at it.  One of them finally gave in and started saying, "Hum, maybe you're right."  Um, I am, he is.  My nephew is.
<b>DR:</b> You, your son?
<b>PT:</b> My nephew.
<b>DR:</b> Your nephew.  And then you said the cousins, too?
<b>PT:</b> My cousin, a couple of cousins.
<b>DR:</b> A couple of cousins.
<b>PT:</b> And I don't know all my cousins.  I've got over 10 of them as far as I know.
<b>DR:</b> But your parents didn't have it?  Or do you think that your mom or dad?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think my father is.  I mean, I don't know him from when he was little.  I do know that mental illness runs on both sides of the family, different forms.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum, um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, mood swings, stuff like that, definitely.
<b>DR:</b> The mood swings?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, big time.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, could be menopause, but they, I remember back when I was this big and I [INAUDIBLE] menopause then.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know.  I know my dad's family also had mental health issues.  Again, none of them really treated.  Back then it was, "Oh, nothing's wrong," or, you know.  If we don't admit it, then there's no problem.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And that's pretty much where it is.  But it's on both sides.
<b>DR:</b> So did the —
<b>PT:</b> He got hit with both sides of the gene pool, too.
<b>DR:</b> From his dad and from you?
<b>PT:</b> His father was, his [NAME OTHER] was.  His grandmother was.
<b>DR:</b> Was he —
<b>PT:</b> His uncle was.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  They're all, I mean, down the line, he got grandmother, father, uncle, sibling.  And that's some of the cousins that I had met that were medicated.  They, their family, the, I, you know.  But the uncle, the father, the grandmother, none of them were taken care of.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Or even interested in it.  In fact, um, her father didn't even want the sibling to be helped.  I had to twist it, so I told him, I said, "You know what, the school said we should do this.  That will look bad on you if you don't take that stuff."  And that's how he got, that's how he got help for the other one.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, yeah, he got nailed on both sides of the gene pool, very close.  It didn't, I, you know, some people say, oh, it skips generations.  This time we didn't skip generations.
<b>DR:</b> Did not.
<b>PT:</b> Not on that, no.  Because his mother, him, his brother.  I didn't meet his other brother, but from what I heard, he was a wild one, too.  Very hyper and —
<b>DR:</b> Did you get yourself into accidents, or would you say that this impulsivity put, like made?
<b>PT:</b> I was barely walking the first time I cracked my forehead open.
<b>DR:</b> Well.  That really —
<b>PT:</b> I was trying to do Michael Jackson.  And do the spinning around the house, and I hit the corner of the wall.  Then I was [AGE] or [AGE], I was sitting on a bench that had bars and I was rocking.  I busted the back of my head open because I couldn't sit still.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I just, I was just bouncing back and forth.
<b>DR:</b> The hyperactivity part?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  Um, not two days after my mom took those stitches out, next to the bed there was a little cabinet, and I was climbing that, and I was up on that and I did something and I fell forward onto the floor.  And I put my teeth through my lip.  Then, maybe a year after that I sliced my thumb wide open with a fillet knife.
<b>CG:</b> Oh, that —
<b>DR:</b> Kind of mistakes that, but they didn't, uh, was all this happening —
<b>CG:</b> And these things had to hurt.
<b>DR:</b> They didn't, they didn't notice that there's something wrong?
<b>PT:</b> Actually, in [DEIDENTIFIED] they did notice, but at the time, Ritalin, my mom said, was too new, and she wasn't going to put it in me, because she didn't know if it would make me sterile when I got older.
<b>DR:</b> So they suggested that?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  From [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  And you didn't —
<b>PT:</b> I have letters from my [DEIDENTIFIED] teacher.
<b>CG:</b> And this thing had to hurt.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, it did.  I have letters from my [DEIDENTIFIED] teacher telling my mom how I can't sit still, I can't do this.  You know, [PATIENT NAME] is all over the place.  She's constantly do backbends over her chair.  She can't do anything.  Since [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> But no treatment?
<b>PT:</b> I didn't start getting treatment until [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  You know what, it wasn't [DEIDENTIFIED], because that would have been Junior High.  [DEIDENTIFIED] I was with my mom.  [DEIDENTIFIED] I got into trouble, she sent me to [DEIDENTIFIED].  So about [DEIDENTIFIED] I started getting treatment, but that was, again, they only, they got stuck with, on the bipolar and the manic.  Because I was, I was on Prozac.  I've been on Prozac, I've been on Paxil, I've been on Mellaril.  Um, and then I went, I was in therapy getting the Paxil, and then I went to [DEIDENTIFIED].  Got out of [DEIDENTIFIED], went home, ran away.  Enrolled myself into high school.  Oh, no, I had to live with my father.  That was fun.  I was with him for a couple of years, then I went back home.  Then I went away, enrolled myself into high school.  Then I got picked up, put in [DEIDENTIFIED], then another hospital somewhere else in California.  I took off from there and then I wound up in Utah at the age of [AGE] until [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> Hum.
<b>PT:</b> And then I went to a residential treatment center to go home, then I went home.  That's pretty much been my life.
<b>CG:</b> Last two years.
<b>PT:</b> But again, it was, uh, and like I said, it's just bipolar.  Not just ADHD.
<b>CG:</b> Last two years in detox.
<b>PT:</b> My grandfather —
<b>CG:</b> You two years in detox.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, two years in detox, very good math.  My mother's father was extremely bipolar.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Manic—depressive.
<b>DR:</b> You have a strong, strong family history of ADHD and bipolar.  And you can tell the symptoms between each, which is the ADHD problem and which is the —
<b>PT:</b> They coincide.  They seem to have, from what I've noticed with myself, to, because I do both.  And I've seen people, like kids with just ADHD, and I've seen people who've suffered from manic—depression or bipolar or whatever you want to call it now.  And I know that sometimes the symptoms seem very similar, almost like they overlap.
<b>DR:</b> Of course, of course.
<b>PT:</b> And so it's very difficult —
<b>DR:</b> Well, we still can.  Which symptoms would you say are similar, in your opinion?
<b>PT:</b> Well, because I have both, it's hard for me to tell within myself.  If I'm looking at two people with two, both, one with one, one with the other.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't, like, the ADHD kids.  You've got the lack of concentration.  Well, obviously, when somebody's depressed or they're manic, they can't concentrate, either.
<b>DR:</b> Good observation.
<b>PT:</b> So that, that's —
<b>DR:</b> That's exactly what, that's very [INAUDIBLE], yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'm very.
<b>CG:</b> Can we go, can we go?
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> I know that you are reading about it, too.
<b>PT:</b> No.  I, I, I do say, I did say that most of my education on it is I work at a school with disabled children.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I, myself, suffer from it.  So I look at my symptoms, I look at what I think it is.  Because I always, if a doctor says, oh, well you have this.  And because when I was little, they always changed it.  One year it was manic—depressive, the next year was bipolar and the next year it was some other depressive thing.  I forgot what they said it was.  And so I researched each one because why is it, within a year, two doctors are telling me two different things.  That's when I learned that bipolar and manic—depressive are pretty much —
<b>DR:</b> Is the same, is the same.
<b>PT:</b> He said [INAUDIBLE] you're talking to.
<b>DR:</b> ADHD is different.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, that's a completely different thing, along with the schizo —
<b>DR:</b> <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>?
<b>PT:</b> Schizoaffective disorder, or <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> is.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Too many, too many names for, uh —
<b>PT:</b> One thing.
<b>DR:</b> For a lot of things, that's right.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.
<b>DR:</b> And sometimes the diagnosis will vary from one doctor to another.
<b>PT:</b> Another.  It's that, well, he might call me bipolar, and this one is going to call a manic—depressive.  But in reality they're talking about the same thing.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And because the ADHD and the mood swings and the bipolar do overlap in some of the symptoms, especially the concentration one, that's why I think a lot of kids, they don't notice it until it's too late and there's already a big can of worms open.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And that's, and that's, that's one thing I'm afraid of.  I don't want somebody overlooking anything if there's something there.  I know there's a difference from a kid who's ADHD who's hyper and all of a sudden has a meltdown or, you know, a fit because they're a little kid.  There's a difference between throwing a temper tantrum because you didn't get the candy bar you want and there's where you're very mellow all of a sudden when just an hour ago or the day before you were climbing the walls.  And now you're mellow, you're calm, you don't want to do anything.  You just want to go.  And any little thing could set you off.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I mean there's a difference.  And there's days that he goes two or three days where he's like that.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And then there's —
<b>DR:</b> And you, you —
<b>PT:</b> And then there's maybe two, three days where he, I can't stop him.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  And you see what your son is doing is similar to what you did as a child?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  Uh, I see him acting out how I did, even though when I was little I didn't se it.  And my mother sees it.  She's gone through with, with me.  She went through every little thing from the [DEIDENTIFIED] teacher saying, "Hey, you know, this child's out of control."  This and that.  And she sees a lot of the stuff in him.
<b>DR:</b> But now you can tell that your mother is more helpful and more pro medication than when you were young.
<b>PT:</b> Because I was put on medication and I became manageable.
<b>DR:</b> I see.
<b>PT:</b> They put me on medication, now she can manage me.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And like I tell people, I'm not taking my medication for me.  Because whether I'm on it or not I can handle myself.  I take it for everybody so they can deal with me.
<b>DR:</b> Good concept.
<b>PT:</b> I don't take it for me, I take it for everybody else.
<b>DR:</b> But you, you have good understanding, though, of your illness, too.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Which is good.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I can't try to help my son or help others if I don't understand what I'm dealing with.  And that's how I focus.
<b>DR:</b> That's really because your son had it and you had it, so you have this —
<b>PT:</b> When he was born we noticed some things.  I mean, months old.  We noticed he was very hyper already.  This is a baby.  Babies usually sleep a lot during the day.  He didn't sleep.  This kid stopped taking naps before he was [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I would keep him up until 12:00, midnight, 1:00 in the morning and he'd be up at 4:00 in the morning trying to climb out of his crib.  He was crawling all over the floor from morning to night nonstop.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I've never, in all my time, the only times I've seen babies do that, usually, I don't get to know them when they're older, but relative, he's just non stop.  She says, "You were the same way."  [AGE] my mother found me sitting on top of the refrigerator.
<b>DR:</b> Is that right?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Yeah.  She didn't think it was very funny.
<b>DR:</b> It was not funny at that time.
<b>PT:</b> Apparently I opened the doors on the counter.
<b>DR:</b> You just climbed —
<b>PT:</b> Climbed up, put the can opener on top of the toaster, climbed up on that and sat on the refrigerator and was kicking my feet.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> That's a lot of —
<b>DR:</b> Couldn't sit still.
<b>PT:</b> I couldn't.
<b>DR:</b> Couldn't sit still, then.
<b>PT:</b> Neither could he.  And he sits still only when he's heading down the roller coaster.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And he's due for a downward spiral.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Do you think that working with horses helped you calm down and manage your concentration better?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Was it a training thing for you, too?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it was a training thing for me, because I also work with horses in an unstructured environment.  It was more of a calming for me, for anything.  When I was, if I was hyper and really just going, I could go to the horses.  And I'm still going, but I'm, I'm more focused.  I'm also, whenever I got depressed and I started to feel, I, I, going to get manic.  I go out to the horse because now I have to be more careful.  I have to be more, my head's still got 100 thoughts running through it, but I'm a little bit more focused.  If I get depressed, which happens, and I go down the roller coaster I can go out to the horse, because I know he ain't going to judge me.  He's, and that will usually calm me down and keep me from completely breaking down and having a meltdown and crying.
<b>DR:</b> So horses were coping, the skills was where, where it —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  What I was, that's, we learned to use them like that in Utah.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> They used the horses as a coping skill for the kids.  They had horses at the school.
<b>DR:</b> And did they use it for ADHD kids and —
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Because even though, like I said, being, having my brain, the only way I can explain everything, well, what's it like?  You just can't sit still, you can't do that.  And the only way I can explain it is if I put you in a room to take an Algebra test and I had 100 different radios on, on different stations and 100 people in there yelling numbers out at you randomly or sentences randomly, that is what goes on in my head every day, all day long.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> That's how I can —
<b>DR:</b> This is how you feel about?
<b>PT:</b> That is how my head.  I am thinking of 100 different things at one time.
<b>DR:</b> This is how you think of it.
<b>PT:</b> Talking to you now, we're having a conversation on one topic, but I'm thinking about five, six other things.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> At the same time.  You know, how he's moving, how he's [INAUDIBLE].  What am I going to when he actually heads down the hill on this roller coaster.  I've learned to judge him, I know where he's at.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>CG:</b> Most of the time when I'm not, like, 26, I'm counting, I'm down to one, I start from one again.  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But I, I just do that.  You ended up with the yellow thing on your clock ticking back and forth.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you are talking distracted.  So you are easily distracted.
<b>PT:</b> Very easily.  I mean, I can sit there and count how many times that thing's going back and forth, back and forth while I'm talking to you, as I'm sitting here watching him move, too.
<b>DR:</b> I see.  Easily distracted.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but if you tried to stop it and put me in a block box with nothing around, I'd go crazy.
<b>DR:</b> You don't like, you, you need a lot of action.
<b>PT:</b> I'd start, I would actually start [INAUDIBLE].  I'd [INAUDIBLE] with my fingers, my hands, or my foot.
<b>DR:</b> Would you?
<b>PT:</b> Because I have to have something else.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> If you put me in a box, a room with nothing in it but a table —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And put a piece of paper, I would go, I'd also, I'll tape the pencil, I'll, I'll start, my fingers will start [INAUDIBLE] back and forth, because I have to keep that.
<b>DR:</b> You have, you have to do more than one thing, multiple things at the same time.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Because my brain's going so fast.  Because that's the only way I can slow down is actually grab some of the thoughts that are running through and deal with those three thoughts.  Um, he'll stutter when you have conversations with him.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> He'll start a sentence and he'll, um, and then he'll start the sentence over.  And then he'll start and then he'll stutter, stop and then start it over.  It's not because he doesn't know what he wants to say, and people will usually assist him, they'll try to rush him.  And I try to explain to people, don't rush him.  Because he wants to tell you, "The dog ran out in the street and got hit by a car."  But by the time he says, "The dog ran out in the street," he's got five other things, probably, going through his head that just push the rest of that sentence out.  So he's got to wait for it to come back around again.  So then he starts over.  "The dog ran out in the street and got.  Um, the dog ran out."  And that's how my brain works, and that's how I look at that.  That's probably what he's going through.  I don't know for sure, because he can't tell me just yet.  And so that's how I treat him.  So when he tries to tell me something, I have to stop and let thing, say, "Oh, okay."  And so I'll repeat what he just told me so he can catch the rest of the thought that's in his head.  So he knows I heard him.
<b>DR:</b> And you are using this skills with the home school.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> So, because you are doing one and one with him.
<b>PT:</b> One on one, I use all the skills that I was taught.
<b>DR:</b> Because you are, you are, you kind of understand how is his mind working, works, so you would do what you think would work for him.  And it looks like it, apparently that's a very good way to go.
<b>PT:</b> Well, it seems to be working, yeah.  Yeah.  It seems to be working.  I wouldn't quite put headphones on him, though.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Because him with music, well, all of a sudden, oh, now I'm dancing, I'm not going to work.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.  Good.
<b>PT:</b> And that would have [INAUDIBLE] —
<b>DR:</b> But you, you are, you are able to redirect him.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I can.  Most of the time I can.  Sometimes it's, he is a, he is a freight train going down the road [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So you let him go and then go for a little bit out and come back or something?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  He takes a break.  He takes his break or whatnot.  Right now the goal, with is IEP is we're working on a, we have a schedule.  I'll have to bring it so you can see it.  He's allowed, he's going to get a little card.  It's a break card.  So if he feels that he needs to take a break during, let's say we're doing math.  He's allowed one break during each subject.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> So if he really thinks I need a, I need a break.  He can go, "Mommy, break card," and give me the break card.  And I let him have a break, five—minute break.  And that break he can go to the bathroom or he can get a drink.  Now, he can't go to the bathroom, get a drink, eat a snack.
<b>DR:</b> One thing.
<b>PT:</b> The idea, it was one break.  Trying to get him to be able to concentrate more where we have a graph and a chart to actually keep track.  Uh, you know, did he keep eye contact with you while you were explaining his lesson.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> That's a big thing, getting him to look at you while you're explaining how to do something, because he's all over the place.
<b>DR:</b> Assuming he, when you have eye contact with him, you know that he got it.
<b>PT:</b> I don't, yeah.  That's it.
<b>DR:</b> At least there, at least there is a chance.
<b>PT:</b> There's a chance he got it, exactly.  Um, another thing that I'm actually going to try this year to help with his eye concentration, I'm going to get one of those stress balls.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Do you use it yourself?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I used to in school before I got my headset.  But if the teacher was talking to me I had to do something with my hands, so I had the little ball of Playdough.
<b>DR:</b> So they, so they tried everything.  They tried the, the ball.  They tried the headset.
<b>PT:</b> And they worked.  They, they did work somewhat.  So I'm going to try the stress ball with him so that when I'm explaining the lesson to him he can sit there and squish the ball in his hand.  He can do something with his hand —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> While he's looking at me and talking rather than doing back flips on his chair —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Or hanging upside down.  Which I have actually taught him to listen while he hung upside down in his chair.  If that's the way he was able to get it, then so be it.  He can't do that in a regular classroom.  But for now until he gets older and learns how to, learns how to use the tools without being fed, hand fed them.  Like I tell him, "Why don't you try doing this, or let's try doing that."  When he gets older enough where he can say, "Oh, you know what.  Maybe I should do this so I can get this done."  Then when he learns, like I did.  I learned the tools, I learned how to use them myself.  Right now I'm teaching him the tools.  Once he's old enough and can tell what tools he needs and which to use, which works best for him, then he'll be okay.  But for right now, he can't.  It's just, his functioning, he has a hard time functioning without being guided.  And so I guide him a little ways.  In fact, like a kid on a bike.  You hold the back of the bike for a little while, you let them go and see if they can do it.  Well, one day he's going to take off on that bicycle and he's just going to go.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Not yet, though.  He's not, he's not that [INAUDIBLE].  But, yeah, everything that I've learned, all of the little tricks of the trade that they tried to teach me.  Things they tried, I had a really good therapist in Utah, really good.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, we, the anger, the, the mattress against the wall.  We had punching bags.  We started with the mattress, then he went out and bought me a punching bag, because I had to vent.  I tend to hold everything inside, so does he.  He holds a grudge.  He'll, somebody will do something to him that will make him mad —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And a week later he'll retaliate.  And I'm like, "Why did you do that?"  "Well, he did this."  I'm thinking that's a week ago.  You guys have been together the whole week and now, all of a sudden you're, you know.  And so I had to learn to not let it build up.  To, how to cope with it so that it didn't build up.  Uh, we went through the newspapers.  We had a box full of scrap papers.  And whenever I got anxious or upset or even depressed or mad or, I'd sit there and rip the paper into tiny little pieces.  Of course, I had to clean it up when I was done, but I had the papers shredded.  I was the paper shredder.  And we tried that.  We did the ball thing when I was taking tests to see if that, if moving my hands would help.  And it did somewhat.  We did the ball thing with the headphones.  You know.  So I'm writing with this hand, squeezing the ball with this hand, I'm listening to my favorite music at the same time I'm taking a test.
<b>DR:</b> Great.
<b>PT:</b> Other kids, "Why does she get that?"  Well, you do want her to get a good grade.
<b>DR:</b> I'm glad that they supported this.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  They were very, I was, um, when.  California paid for me to go to Utah.  My mom didn't pay, my dad didn't pay.  California paid for me to go to Utah.
<b>DR:</b> The state.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> To be, uh, what is [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I'm under Act 80-36-32.
<b>DR:</b> Was it a boarding school?
<b>PT:</b> It was a residential treatment center.
<b>DR:</b> Residential treatment?
<b>PT:</b> I, I'm under the 80-36-32 program, federal program in California.  Now the reason they were willing to, when I ran away from home and I was doing drugs and stuff, I enrolled myself in high school.
<b>DR:</b> So they noticed that you wanted to —
<b>PT:</b> They thought —
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Oh, well, she, she took that incentive, so we're going to get her.  And once they got a hold of me, they sent me away.  I was their poster child.  I was their poster child, because I,  I excelled over there.  I found a lot of things that, that work.  I did really well.  I came back and did well.  They put me in a transition home, treatment center.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I ran away from it.  Here I am, two years of recovery and doing really well, so I run away again?
<b>DR:</b> Again?  Hum.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't like the fact that the staff at the school were using me to break up the fights because I was the only one under 18 that was willing to help them.  Rather than join in the fights, when the girls got into fights, they'd use me to go break it up.
<b>DR:</b> And you didn't like that?
<b>PT:</b> No.  In fact, the lady, [NAME OTHER], I think was her name, in California.  She was like the main worker, and when I came she apologized what, six years later?  I, my, I was working, I was volunteering at a ranch and the boss, her daughter was going through exactly what I was going through.  And I was getting her information.  Well, she was going to her worker, going well, what about this, what about that, what about this.  And she was, "Where are you getting your, all this information from?"  And when she told her she said, "Oh, my God.  She was mine."
<b>DR:</b> I see.
<b>PT:</b> And so she was, and she was telling her all the stories.  But I was, I was like their poster child.  They went out of their way.  I mean, it was like over $1,000 a month.  He, he even —
<b>DR:</b> Of course.
<b>PT:</b> It was [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>CG:</b> Can we go?
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Well, [PATIENT NAME], I want to thank you very much for —
<b>PT:</b> No problem.  Yeah, if you've got anything like that, studies and stuff —
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> Whatever, I don't mind.
<b>DR:</b> We'll let them know that you are interested.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.  It's like every time we come to my appointments, they talk about you and —
