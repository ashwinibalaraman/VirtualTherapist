<b>T</b>EN YEARS HAD PASSED since I'd last seen or spoken to my
parents. There were times when I had been hospitalized
just a few hours' drive from their home, yet they hadn't visited
or even phoned me. Why should I think they would
now intercede, with almost a decade and half a country's
distance between us? I agonized over whether to contact
them. One thing was clear: They were my <i>only</i> means of getting
out of the hell that was Pueblo State Hospital. And so
one day, my fingers shaking, I dialed home. A recorded
message said that the number had been changed and the
new number was unlisted.


I remembered the phone number of Aunt Joan, my
father's older sister, and tried that. After two rings, my aunt
answered. Though I'd placed the call, I was startled by hearing
a voice from my past on the other end of the line. "Please
call my parents," I asked her, "and give them the number of

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A patient wanted to make a call. I tried to explain the situation,
but he shoved me aside, deposited a coin, and began
dialing his number. I stood a few feet away. He dropped the
receiver, letting it dangle from the call box while he walked
up to me and told me to back off ... or else. I retreated. The
minute he finished his conversation, I resumed my sentry
position at the phone. Another patient approached. This
time, I played the tough guy. "I'm waiting for a very important
call," I announced, deepening my voice and glaring at
him. "If you want to use this phone right away, you'll have to
go through me to get it." Our eyes met, and I thought we were
about to get into a battle when he blinked and shuffled off.


A few minutes later, the phone rang. I picked up the
receiver and heard my father on the other end of the line. "Is
Kenny Steele there?" His voice was little changed. I felt
myself shaking.


"This is Ken," I said. I couldn't recall the last time I had
answered to that name.


The first thing my dad asked was why I had bothered my
aunt. I told him that his own number was unlisted and it was
the only way I could get to him. I asked about the family. He
said that he, my mother, and brother were fine. "And
Grandma?" I asked. That's when I learned that my beloved
grandmother had died more than a year earlier, on August
22, 1974, a few weeks before her eighty-seventh birthday. I
went silent, but my father reminded me that this was a long-distance
call. What did I want?


I gulped, dove in, and told him where I was, that I desperately
wanted to leave and needed his help. He had to consent

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The phone call and the news of Grandma's death hit me
like a one-two punch. <i>She's gone</i>, said my voices. <i>Your
grandma's gone to heaven. Fat chance</i> you <i>have of seeing her
again. The voices also made a fuss about my brother: Boy,
that Joey's a big kid now.... He's fine, didn't you hear that?
Nothing's wrong with Joey.... You told him you were fine, too.
You know you're not fine, Kenny. You lied again. Liars go to
hell. You're in a living hell, and you're going to stay here</i>.


Filled with pain and fury, I felt a need to strike out at the
world. I began to roam the area looking for fights. Challenging
the most dangerous men on the violent ward, I managed
to get involved in two serious scuffles before day's end. I
expected these guys to hurt me, and I wanted them to do
their worst. I was tired of hurting so much inside. The voices
were right. I should have taken my life years ago. If I couldn't
manage it, maybe I could incite one of the groups here to do
the deed for me. Once I took this attitude, however, I became
the feared one. These guys wouldn't kill me; they backed
away when I walked by.


"Steele!" I heard my name shouted. "Telephone!"

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My father was on the line. "Your brother wants to know
you," he said bluntly. "Tell me where you are and what I
have to do to get you out of there."


"Please wait a minute," I said to my dad. I put down the
receiver and moved as if in a trance. Eleven steps to the
nurses' station. I knocked on the glass window and asked the
person on duty, "Can you speak to my father, please?" She
emerged from her cubicle and went quickly to the phone. I
stood by as the staff member told my father who to contact
about "Shannon's" release. Then she handed me the receiver.


"Who's Shannon?" asked my father.


"It's too long a story to go into right now," I said, adding,
"And this is a long-distance call." I still knew what buttons
to push.


"Right," said my dad. He told me that he would do what
was needed to get me back home. Even as I thanked him, I
wanted to cry "Stop!" at the top of my lungs. Something
inside me knew that this was wrong, that I shouldn't go
home again. But my voices were having a field day with the
news. <i>Kenny's going home to meet his younger brother</i>, they
called out gleefully. <i>Oh, how sweet. We're going to meet Joey,
the good kid. We can't wait, can't wait</i>....


The fact that my voices were cheering on my return home
only heightened my concern.


The state of Colorado was so pleased to have someone else
assume the cost of my care, it even provided me with one-way
fare from Denver's Stapleton International Airport to
Bradley Field in Hartford, Connecticut, where my parents
were to meet me. But first, I had to be made presentable. My
hair, worn long in the hospital, was cut to a respectable

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Tarred and feathered out of town</i>, said my voices, <i>but at
least they kicked you out in style</i>.


I wondered if my parents would recognize me. My
appearance had changed a lot in ten years. But not enough.
My father met me at the gate, and we recognized each other
instantly. Strangers would have guessed we were kin. Dad
accompanied me to the baggage claim area. He insisted on
carrying both suitcases to the parking lot, where we located
his green Toyota station wagon. Inside sat my mom. When I
first saw her, it took my breath away because she so closely
resembled my grandmother.


We drove the hour and a quarter west along Route 84 to
Prospect, alternating silence with awkward conversation.
Dad brought me up-to-date on the status of his Pittsburgh
teams. Mom said that Joey was eager to meet me. I asked
them to tell me more about Joey. This was clearly a welcome
topic. My parents spoke glowingly about his good nature.
They told me that he loved sports, excelling in both football
and baseball. They didn't ask about my life, and I didn't ask
about Grandma's final days. We kept the talk safe.


The house seemed even smaller than I remembered.
Inside there were changes. The room that had been occupied
by Grandma was now my parents' bedroom, while their

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then Joey arrived. When I first set eyes on my brother, it
was like looking into a mirror at my own image when I was
his age. The Steele men all look alike. But the similarity
stopped right there. Joey greeted me awkwardly and asked if
I wanted to play an electronic football game with him after
dinner. I said I was a little tired and asked if we could play
the next day. Joey asked about the plane I'd flown on and
seemed disappointed that I didn't remember what model it
was. He asked if I'd seen any recent ball games. He knew
every player's statistics and shared them with me, trying to
gain my approval. I listened, fascinated by this creature--the
me my parents wanted. He talked throughout dinner. Then
he prepared for bed. It was a school night, after all, our
father reminded him.


I asked my mother if I could look through Grandma's family
album. She said she would join me. We turned the pages,
looking at photographs of my grandmother as she grew from
a young girl in Pennsylvania to the beautiful bride of a man
who managed a fruit farm, then to a wise and adored mother
of four and grandmother of sixteen. My mother turned to me
and said, in an unusual expression of kindness, "You were
always her favorite grandchild, you know. 'My special one' is
what she called you." She added, "Your grandmother was the
best friend you ever had." I knew that. Back once again in
the home where we had lived together, holding Grandma's
life's record in my hands, I felt how great was my loss.

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I needed air. It was fall, a cool breeze was blowing in from
Canada, and I thought a brisk walk would be invigorating.
"I'm going out for a while," I announced. My father gave me
a look that lasted long enough to make his point: I was under
surveillance. He'd be the one to decide if my behavior merited
the granting of ground privileges here.


"Okay," he said curtly. "But be back in fifteen minutes,
that's it."


I walked to the small recreation area just up the street
from our home, sat in the bleachers of the football field, and
I cried. No question about it, coming home had been a mistake.
This was where the voices had first visited me, and
they were still present--only more powerful. They continued
to dominate my life, leaving me in ruins time and again.
A feeling of dread overwhelmed me. I didn't want to fall
apart here with my family. I would visit for a few days, thank
my folks for their hospitality, shake my brother's hand, and
then move on without fuss or mess. That was my plan.


Events took a different turn.


For the first few days of my visit, the voices were subdued
--quietly chatting in the background like the gentle
hubbub created by Saturday shoppers at the mall: clearly
there, but not intrusive. Pueblo State had supplied enough
pills to get me through the first couple of weeks at home
(by which time, they believed, I would have found a
new doctor), but I took none of them. I was saving the
pills for a new suicide plan, one that I'd begun plotting earlier
that year after I overheard hospital attendants speaking about
a young woman back East who had mixed psychiatric medications
with alcohol and was then in a coma. They said she
was being kept alive but was brain dead. I liked the idea of

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In an effort to learn more about the incident, I visited the
Prospect town library. ("Tell him not to come home late,"
said my father when my mother phoned him at work to see if
I could leave the house.) There was a new librarian at the
information desk. I asked if she remembered hearing about
the young woman in the coma, providing what scant details I
had of the incident. "Oh, you must mean Karen Ann Quinlan,"
she said at once. "It's so sad." She suggested that I read
up on the story in newspaper editions from the period March
through May 1975, directing me to the section where they
were stored. Soon I had the information I needed. The medications
used by Miss Quinlan were anti-anxiety agents, Valium
and Librium. I needed to get hold of them.


It was growing dark when I got home, and my mother
looked annoyed. "Sorry," I said. "You know I tend to lose
myself in the library." I'd applied for a card, and in a few
days I would take out Ken Kesey's <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest</i>, a novel about mental illness that became an award-winning
film starring Jack Nicholson. Kesey had nothing new to
tell me. The territory was familiar.


My mother was preparing dinner, and I offered to help,
explaining that I had earned my living as a cook. I think she
believed it was another of my made-up stories. "I can manage
better alone," she said, and so I retreated to my basement
quarters, where I passed the time looking through a stack of
records. With some surprise, I came upon <i>Stop the World, I
Want to Get Off</i>, the last album I'd bought before leaving
home. I must have been prescient way back then, for the title
exactly described the way I was feeling now. I put the record

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Joey had come home from school and was in his room,
doing his homework. Mom was cooking a pot roast. It was
past seven when I heard my father's car in the driveway. The
moment my father entered the house, Joey came flying down
the stairs to welcome him and tell him all about how football
practice had gone and report the coach's indecision about
which position Joey should play.


"Quarterback is your position," said my father. "The
coach will make you quarterback or he'll have to speak to me
about it." At dinner, the talk moved from football to grades.
Joey was an honor student, but my dad said he expected all
As and no more B's on the next report card. "You need to be a
scholar-athlete," he told my brother, who nodded solemnly.


The meal over, my father asked me to join him outside on
the back stairs. This was a first, and I wondered if his paternal
benevolence now extended to me as well. I'd barely sat
down when my father informed me that he'd managed to get
me a job. "It's with a medical instrument manufacturer who
needs quality assurance people," he said. "The plant is
located in downtown Waterbury, so I'll be able to drop you
off on my way to work, and you can take the bus home. You
start Monday." Then he added his blessing: "It's a simple job,
so you shouldn't have any trouble with it."


"Thanks," I said. I told him briefly about some of the
assembly-line jobs I'd held over the years. He nodded
approvingly.


"I want you and your brother to get to know each other,"
he said. "But I must warn you: The first time I see any

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Yes." I then asked if I could see a doctor so that I could
maintain my medication and therapy.


"The people at the hospital told me you needed to see a
mental doctor," he answered, "and I'll ask around, but I
don't want you bringing any of that kind of talk into the
house. As soon as you get a paycheck, I'll expect you to pay
for the doctor and the medication. Your mother and I will
figure out what's fair for room and board, too."


Meeting adjourned.


And so I began a routine of work and home, where my
parents pretty much left me alone. Joey approached winning
me over as vigorously as he pursued excellence in sports,
trying to engage me in one or another of his interests and
enthusiasms. Even as I admired his determination in attempting
to break through to this strange older brother, I resented
the ease with which he seemed to be sailing through the rest
of life. I said nothing about this to him, but I was difficult to
reach and I sensed that he knew I was jealous.


The job wasn't bad. I wore a white jacket and cap, and I
inspected medical instrument parts under a microscope to
ensure that a particular electrical wire was correctly connected
at both ends. As before, I found the repetitious nature
of the work oddly soothing; it kept my voices and hallucinations
under control. Soon I was working overtime and earning
much more money. My father was pleased with me,
although the added work meant that I wouldn't always make
it home in time for dinner. Joey was glad that my father
seemed less critical of my behavior. On the surface, then, life
was calm.

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Except that I hadn't abandoned my design to kill my
brain.


The Ruler was happy with this. <i>This is the first intelligent
idea you've had in a long time</i>, he told me. I could see his
pointed red tongue licking his thin lips in pleasure, his sharp
teeth and gleaming eyes. <i>Just swallow the pills and then drink
yourself into oblivion. Eternal oblivion, that's what it's all
about. Karen Ann Quinlan knows this. Soon you will know it,
too</i>.


I'd begun seeing a psychiatrist in Waterbury, who prescribed
Thorazine (to suppress my voices) and Librium
(because I complained of feelings of anxiety). I had the prescriptions
filled but didn't use either of the medications, saving
them for the overdose that I planned to take. Then I discovered
a bar near my workplace, where I would sometimes
stop to have a drink or two at day's end. I confided to the
bartender that I was feeling anxious. "I'd rather use medication
than alcohol to calm me down," I said, "but I don't
know where to get the stuff." One evening, he told me he
could get Valium at a good price; and the next night, he sold
me an entire bottle of the pills. <i>Here's to your successful dying</i>,
the voices toasted me as I drank my beer. <i>This time, you will
finally get it right</i>.


There was often alcohol on my breath on the nights when
I came home late from work. My father asked me to stop
drinking, but since I hadn't caused any disturbance (yet), he
didn't forbid me a drink or two. I took that as permission.
Even with several drinks under my belt, I could still hear the
voices as they continued to shout invectives at me. But now I
knew the day was coming when I would be rid of them and
the world would be rid of me. Everybody would be happy.

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One morning, I left for work with a pocketful of pills and
all of my savings. (I'd just paid the doctor's bill and my parents
for room and board, so the total didn't amount to much.)
As always, my father dropped me off at the plant, but that
day I didn't enter the building. When his car was out of
sight, I walked in the direction of the bar and waited for it to
open. I was the first customer. Calmly, I swallowed some Thorazine
and a lot of the Librium and Valium (planning to finish
them all during the course of the day), drinking it all
down with a Jack Daniel's straight up with ice. More pills,
more Jack Daniel's.


Then ... blackout.


The events that followed are reconstructed from fragments
of distorted memory and the accounts of others. I was
thrown out of the bar and somehow made my way to the
Waterbury train station. I don't know why I went there.
Maybe I was trying to leave Waterbury. What I do remember,
vaguely, is walking down the street <i>away</i> from the train
station when I was chased down by two police officers in a
cruiser. I ran and they followed, caught up with me, and savagely
beat me. The next thing I recall was waking up in a jail
cell. Two of my front teeth had been knocked out; another
tooth was broken. My face was black, blue, purple, and red.
My eyes were swollen; I saw out of slits. My head and entire
body throbbed with pain. Charges had been made against
me.


Someone must have phoned my home, for my father was
present to post a bail bond that would get me out of jail that
same night. With that accomplished, he drove his son the
prisoner home. Not a word passed between us. Furious as my
father was, he couldn't have hurt me more than I'd already

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Kenny, come up here now!" she shouted down to the
basement the next morning. My mother rarely raised her
voice.


I jumped, or fell, off the sofa.


"Kenny, I mean it!"


Despite the pain, I managed to pull myself up and crawl
upstairs. It felt like the steps were moving. I clung to the
banister.


In her hand, my mother held a copy of that morning's
<i>Waterbury Republican</i>, the local paper that was delivered
daily to our front door and to the homes of almost every
other family in our town and surrounding area. "Read this,"
she ordered, shoving the paper in front of me. Her hand
shook as she pointed to "The Common Pleas Court," a listing
of arrests, charges, and dispositions taken from the police
blotter. There in black and white was my name, Kenneth
Steele, my parents' address, and the charges: lewd act, resisting
arrest, disorderly conduct, breaking the peace.


My head reeled. What lewd act had I performed? Why
was there no mention of drunkenness or an overdose of pills?
Didn't "they" understand that I was sick--sick of the voices,
sick of myself, sick of everything? Stop the world, I had <i>tried</i>
to get off. Again I had failed.


The phone rang all day long with calls to my mother from
friends and neighbors, some sympathetic, others just hoping
to learn more of the gory details. When my father arrived
home, he ordered me to step outside. He wanted to speak to

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My day in court arrived soon. I was represented by a
legal aid attorney. He told me the allegation: that I'd exposed
myself to another person in the bathroom at the train station.
I found the very idea appalling. I had no memory of this act
and have no history of doing this at any other time in my life.
It goes against the very core of me. Even when I lived on the
street, I made a great effort to assure that I was out of sight
whenever I had to relieve myself outdoors. The attorney was
surprised to hear from me about the pills and drinking and
the fact that I was in some sort of unconscious state when the
things I was charged with doing were alleged to have
occurred, and he said he would speak to the bartender. He
addressed the court, and the judge granted us a continuation
of the case. In the meantime, bail was continued, and I
returned to my parents' home.


My final paycheck was just enough to pay for some badly
needed dental work. Two more teeth were pulled, and the
dentist placed a temporary cap on another. I wouldn't have

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They went on and on, and I became more and more
desperate--so desperate that I then <i>knowingly</i> committed a
criminal act. Worse yet, the people I hurt most were those
responsible for bringing me into this world. I stole a check
from my father's checkbook, made it out in the amount of
$250, forged his signature, and cashed it at the bank where I
had cashed my paychecks. Then I returned home, packed my
belongings, and, carrying my two suitcases, sneaked out the
back way of our house to Route 68 at the end of our street. I
had in mind to head north toward Maine.


The day was as dark as my heart and wet as my tears.
Rain mixed with ice, and I think the driver who picked me
up would have taken pity on any stray cat out in that

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was stunned by dismay over what I had done. Alone
that night (but for the voices), I got out notebook and pen
and wrote a long letter to my father and mother, trying to
explain why I'd left without having resolved the mess with
the police. I promised to pay them back for the bad check
(and I did, years later). Then I wrote to the attorney and
judge, informing them that I'd left town without the knowledge
or consent of my parents. I wanted to write to Joey but
could not find the words. What do you tell your kid
brother--that you love him? that you're sorry? that you
hope his team wins? that he's better off without you in his
life? I enclosed the correspondence to the lawyer and the
judge in the envelope with the letter to my parents and
addressed it to their home. The next morning, I bought a
thirteen-cent stamp from the operator of the motel. He promised
to mail the letter for me, and I took him at his word.


Dropped off in Hartford, I headed straight for a bar but,
after one drink, decided that it was time to check out
another hospital, another emergency room, another psychiatrist.
I was hurting physically and emotionally. Soon I was in
an ambulance, heading to Norwich State Hospital in the
southeastern part of Connecticut, where I stayed for almost
two years. One of the first things that happened there was
that I was provided with a dental bridge and good dental
care, for which I was very grateful. My body healed slowly.
Little else distinguished this stay from many other institutionalizations.
I now had the hospital routine down pat: Give

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In time, I entered yet another halfway house and found
another job in a nursing home as an orderly. I worked hard at
my job, squirreling my salary away in a passbook account. I
even cut down on my smoking (a habit I'd developed over
the years in institutions), going from three packs a day to one
to save the difference in cost. My new goal--inaugurated by
the voices--was to earn enough to pay for a bus ticket from
Connecticut to San Francisco, with some money left over for
food and lodging when I got there. The reserve wouldn't
have to last very long. I intended to make the ultimate suicide
leap off the Golden Gate Bridge.


The bus ride to San Francisco took four days. My fellow
travelers were a varied lot: elderly women who loved to tell
their stories and understood that I would be a patient listener;
family groups (mostly women with small children);
male loners whom I knew to avoid. My years on the street
had given me some intuitive skills that I put to good use.


I was paranoid during the entire trip. Concerned that
"people" would do me harm and thwart my game plan, I
kept my money hidden in my socks and tied my sneakers
tightly, retrieving a ten- or twenty-dollar bill, as needed, in
the privacy of a locked stall in the men's room of any rest
area we visited. I had bought some paperback books before
boarding the bus, and I read to lower the voices' volume. I
also took Trilafon, the antipsychotic drug supplied me by the
hospital upon discharge.

Through Utah, Nevada, then on to Sacramento ... By the
latter part of the journey, I had exhausted both my reading

Driving into San Francisco, with its rolling hills and deep
blue bay spanned by a majestic bridge, was like entering
Emerald City. It was a clear morning and the world seemed to
sparkle. The bridge I had come to jump from wasn't gold at
all but painted red. Still, I didn't feel cheated. San Francisco
was to become my second favorite place anywhere, right
after Manhattan.


Bus stations often are located in neighborhoods where
low-cost lodging can be found. In San Francisco, that district
is known as the Tenderloin. I stored my suitcases in a locker
and went out looking for a hotel or rooming house that I
could afford. I walked and walked the Tenderloin, checking
out places that seemed more like flophouses than anything
else. There had to be something better.


Carrying a copy of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, I entered a
coffee shop near Market and Powell Streets, took a seat at the
counter, ordered a cup of coffee, and sat drinking it while I
skimmed the "Rooms to Let" section of the classifieds. There
were several affordable listings on the fringe of the Tenderloin.
The counterman directed me to Polk Street, where I
soon found a weekly rental (toilet and bath down the hall)
that seemed better than anything I had seen earlier. I took it,
redeemed my luggage from the station, and moved right in.


First thing on my schedule was getting clean. After luxuriating
in the shower for about a half hour, I emerged to find
two guys waiting impatiently in the narrow hallway outside
the bathroom. They let me know they were miffed. I gave
them my Pueblo Hospital glare-and-growl routine, and they

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The bad news, I quickly found out, was that I wouldn't
be able to get a job as an orderly in a nursing home. California
required special training and a certificate, which I didn't
have. That left cooking as my primary skill, but I hadn't
done any cooking in a long time and never had done quick
grill work (a specialty area in which there seemed to be many
jobs available). On the third day of my search, I ran into one
of the two men who had waited outside the bathroom on my
first day at the rooming house. I explained that it had been
my first shower following a cross-country trip. The fellow,
who was named Chuck, laughed and said it was okay; he
understood. Would I like to join him for a cup of coffee?


At the counter of a nearby diner, I told Chuck that I was
looking for a job and that I had some experience cooking in
institutions. "Wait a minute," he said. "I may be able to
help." As chance would have it, a friend from Chuck's hometown
in Nebraska worked as a cook in a residence club in the
area and, said Chuck, "I think he mentioned that he was
looking for an assistant." He wrote down the friend's name
(Rob), the name of the club, and the phone number. "Call
and see if the position is still open," he suggested. "And use
my name."


I phoned and made an appointment for the following day.


I located the club easily, met with Rob, and told him
about my cooking experience in halfway houses and the
nursing home in Westboro, Massachusetts. I was open about
some of my psychiatric history, giving him an outline but

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The residence club was a genteel sort of place that housed
sixty-four people, men and women of varying ages. There
was a range of accommodation, from private rooms with or
without baths to shared quarters for two. Breakfast and dinner
were included in the fee. I would be expected to help
Rob prepare and serve two meals six days a week, plus a
brunch buffet on Sundays. "If things work out," he said,
"we'll make the arrangement permanent, and you'll be
expected to move into a room here." I moved in before the
month was up.


<i>Enough with your promises, Kenny</i>, taunted my voices.
<i>Your word isn't worth a thin dime. You came here to end your
life, not try to start it over again. They warned, Remember
how many people you have hurt so far. You don't want to hurt
these good people, too, do you? You must stop your work
of destruction and finally die. You know where the bridge is.
Use it!</i>


The voices were right. I <i>had</i> become caught up in the
friendliness and the hope that I saw in San Francisco. If there
was a geographic cure for my illness, I allowed myself to
think, surely this was the place where I would find peace.
Rob, my boss, was supportive; the club's tenants were
friendly and appreciative, and I tried my hardest to remain
safe and sane--going so far as to see a psychiatrist so that he
could prescribe Trilafon, the one medication that managed at
times to reduce the intensity of my voices and hallucinations,
even when I took it at low doses. And I did take it--no
tonguing the pills this time around.

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In November 1978, the year I turned thirty, two horrific
events occurred that affected many of the good people of San
Francisco. First came the incredible tragedy of Jonestown, a
commune established in Guyana by the Reverend Jim Jones,
formerly of San Francisco (as were many of his followers). On
a trip to Guyana to look into the doings of the People's Temple
(as Jones's community was called), California Congressman
Leo J. Ryan and four people who accompanied him were
shot and killed. More than 910 of Jones's followers were also
found dead, victims of a mass suicide brought about by
drinking grape Kool-Aid laced with potassium cyanide.
<i>(You're such a loser that you couldn't manage the death of one
measly person, said my voices, and here more than 900 people
had the courage to kill themselves.)</i> Jones was found shot in
the head (whether by his own hand or another's was not certain).
Many of the people I knew in the area, including several
of my coworkers, lost friends and family in Guyana. I
shared in their grief.


Nine days later, on November 27, San Francisco Mayor
George Moscone and Harvey Milk, the city's popular and
first openly gay supervisor, were gunned down by a man
named Dan White, a former city supervisor. The nation
watched on television as Acting Mayor Dianne Feinstein,
then president of the Board of Supervisors, announced their
deaths. That night, I joined thousands of San Franciscans in
a walk from Market and Castro Streets to City Hall. Many of
the marchers carried candles. All were in mourning. The
only sound heard was that of people walking. Then Joan
Baez, the folksinger, sang "Amazing Grace" in her clear,
sweet voice, and all around me people began to cry.

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had trouble dealing with the deep and mixed feelings
that these events created within me. I didn't know how to
process all of the grief and pain I saw in every direction--
from friends of mine to total strangers. I was beginning to
lose it. My voices instructed me to down my entire supply
of Trilafon with an industrial-strength cleaner that would
be as toxic as the cyanide had proven for the residents of
Jonestown. <i>Do it now, right away</i>, they spurred me on. <i>Bottoms
up</i>.


For the first time ever, I confided what I was going
through to a friend. I told Rob that I planned to commit suicide
and that the voices were pushing me to get it over with
right away. He listened attentively, then said, "I think it's
time we got you some help, Shannon."


"Please don't tell people what I just told you," I said.
"Please tell them that I'm suffering from depression over the
loss of my lover, Karl." The stigma connected with schizophrenia
was so strong that I'd rather have been seen as
lovelorn than loco.


"This stays between us," Rob promised. Then he asked
someone on the staff to please keep an eye on things in the
kitchen while he drove me to a nearby hospital. To my surprise,
I was not placed in restraints and shipped to a state
institution. Instead, I was taken to Pacific Presbyterian Hospital,
a private hospital in San Francisco that had a number
of state-funded beds set aside for indigent patients, where I
was placed on a psychiatric unit.


The contrast between being treated at this private hospital
and my previous experiences in state institutions was like
the difference between staying in a four-star hotel and being
assigned a bed in a homeless shelter. Although a resident in a

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The doctors were far more respectful of the patients. I
told them which medications produced bad side effects and
which were safer and more effective. They listened. They put
me on a low dose of Trilafon along with a tolerable dose of
Thorazine, which had been overprescribed for me in state
hospitals. Like Trilafon, Thorazine helped lessen the intensity
of my voices, but the dosage had to be monitored so that
it would not cause the feeling of jumping out of my skin, the
need to keep constantly moving.


The most important part of this hospitalization for me
was that I had visitors every day, sometimes twice a day.
They brought me books. They brought their friendship,
which helped to combat the maleficent messages of my
voices. People actually cared about me and wanted me to get
well. As a result, I was able to leave the hospital after only
five weeks, and I had a room, job, coworkers, and friends to
be discharged to. If they could care that much about me, I
told myself, I could care enough to try to fight the voices and
hallucinations.


I wanted to do something useful with my life. Dianne
Feinstein was running for election as mayor of San Francisco.
I decided to use some of my free time to volunteer in her

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the meantime, I kept my day job. One day, Rob was visited
by a friend in full naval dress uniform--a handsome
man with a head of black hair and startlingly blue eyes. "The
fleet's in," he told Rob jubilantly, and asked if there was a
vacancy at the residence.


"Sorry, we're full," Rob told him, "but please stay and
have dinner as my guest." Then Rob turned to me. "Shannon,
this is Petty Officer Lee Royster Jr.," he said, "known as
Junior to his friends. Can you find a place for him at one of
the tables?"


I showed him to a seat. People in the room began to point
at him and whisper. "Is it ...?" "Could it be?" Junior was a
dead ringer for Fred Grandy, who played Burt "Gopher"
Smith on the long-running television series <i>The Love Boat</i>,
and was constantly being mistaken for the actor.

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later in the meal, I checked to see that he had everything
he needed. After all, he was Rob's friend. "Everything's
fine," he told me, "except that I'm a stranger in this town
and have no plans for this evening and no one to share it
with. Care to join me for a drink after work?"


"Sure," I said. "There's the P.S. Restaurant &amp; Bar right
down the street. Rob and I can probably make it once we've
cleared things away." But Rob had other plans that evening,
so I went alone to meet Junior. I was interested in hearing
about life in the navy: where he had traveled, what he
had seen. I was looking for another good story, but what
I got instead was a pass. Almost immediately, Junior asked
me to go back with him to his hotel. <i>That</i> explained his interest
in me. I was hurt and offended. "You have the wrong
guy," I said. "I'm no ho." I got up and walked quickly out of
the bar.


<i>Yes you are, Kenny</i>, said my voices as I headed down the
street, trying to walk off my anger. <i>Yes you are a ho, and he
spotted you right away. You're a ho on sight. Everyone knows
about you. The satellites circling the earth are sending your
image and all the details about your sordid, sick life to everyone
around the world</i>. The voices laughed, as if to say, How stupid
can you be? Did you actually think you could change?
Did you think you could make a new life for yourself?


I passed another bar and went in to try to still the voices
and the demeaning message that they played like a broken
record. <i>Ho ... Sordid ... Sick ... Everyone knows about you</i>.
I drank myself into oblivion and experienced the second
blackout of my life. After I came to and shamefacedly
returned to the residence, Rob told me that he thought I had
a problem with alcohol and urged me to attend a meeting of

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At my first meeting, called a Speakers Meeting, I sat rapt
as I listened to a man not much older than I talk about his life
journey. Like me, he had been homeless. Like me, he had
been plagued by demons. <i>Wow, I thought. Maybe I'm a
paranoid alcoholic and not a paranoid schizophrenic</i>. The possibility
that I might have been misdiagnosed all these years
gave me optimism. Alcoholics could get better and stay that
way. Schizophrenia, according to what I'd read, was a lifetime
affliction. (Forget that <i>my</i> demons had first visited me
when I was fourteen and that I hadn't had a drink until I was
in my twenties. This wasn't about rationality; it was about
hope.)


I waited till the end of the meeting to have a word with
the speaker, a man named Joe Brennan. He invited me to join
him at a nearby luncheonette where many AA members congregated.
Joe was a counselor at Acceptance House, a residential
community for recovering alcoholics and substance
abusers. Over coffee, I told him my life story and asked
whether I might be alcoholic instead of schizophrenic. He
listened and said he thought it was likely.


He told me a bit about the organization. There was much
in the AA experience and recovery process that I found
appealing. AA asked one to admit powerlessness before
drink. Well, I <i>was</i> powerless, only my nemeses were my
demon voices and delusions. AA's emphasis on a higher religious
power and making amends with those whom you have
hurt fit right in with my Roman Catholic beliefs and
upbringing. Best of all, AA didn't believe in the taking of
psychiatric medicines. According to its tenets, these medications

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At each meeting, I listened and learned. Eventually, I,
too, rose to address the audience. "My name is K. Shannon
Steele," I said. "I'm a paranoid alcoholic. I used to believe I
was a paranoid schizophrenic, but now I know I am an alcoholic."
And then I told my story, a mixture of truth and
embellishment (I was not just an alcoholic, but a Harvard-educated
alcoholic). I had the audience in tears.


Joe suggested that I move into Acceptance House. I was
reluctant to leave my job at the residence house, but I'd been
experiencing some friction there. Rob and others who truly
cared for me argued that my primary problem was not alcoholism;
I desperately needed to believe that it was. And so I
left job and friends and moved into Acceptance House,
where Joe had promised me a job as house cook. He proved
not to be as good as his word. What Joe wanted, it turned
out, was to have me under his roof. What had happened to
my street smarts? How could I not have seen this coming? I
felt not just deceived, but terribly, incredibly stupid. Too
stupid to live.


The voices directed me to another building, another
rooftop from which I pondered whether and how to end it
all. Then God sent another angel. Someone spotted me,
phoned the police, and, as before, I was taken away in four-point
restraints, this time to Napa Valley State Hospital, a
place that rivaled Pueblo State in its inhumane treatment of

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In desperation, I placed a call to Rob. My reluctance to
tell him just how stupid I had been was overcome by the
strength of my desire to get out of this snake pit. Rob's
response was warm and more generous than I deserved. He
never said, "I told you so," never demanded more details
than I was willing to provide. He told me that he was glad to
get my call, that everyone had been worried about me, that
he'd do his best to get me out, and that I still had a room and
a job. I sobbed when I got off the phone. I cried even more a
week later when I was back in my bed at the residence. I was
grateful to be home.


There was a message for me to call the office of Lee Dolson,
a member of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors. I
waited several days before making the call. In my paranoia, I
feared that it was a ruse, something that would get me
recommitted to the wards at Napa Valley. When I phoned, a
secretary answered and said yes, the supervisor wished to
meet with me, then asked when would be a convenient time
for me to come in. Despite the warnings of my voices--<i>The
government's after you, Kenny; you've gone too far this time</i>--I
agreed to meet with the supervisor at City Hall.

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the appointed day and time, Supervisor Dolson welcomed
me into his office. He was a man of medium height,
slightly paunchy, who could have been in his fifties or sixties.
He showed me to a seat and moved to the chair behind a
desk covered with mementos of his former career as a commander
in the navy. He asked me to tell him something about
myself. The story I told was that I had attended Exeter and
received both bachelor's and master of business degrees from
Harvard, that I'd had problems with alcoholism, and that I
was now living in a residence in the area, trying to get my
life back on track.


"I asked you here today on the recommendation of one of
my advisers, a member of AA, who heard you speak at a
meeting and recommended that I consider you for appointment
to the City wide Alcoholism Advisory Board," he said.
"Unlike many other boards and commissions, the CAAB has
real power. Members make the funding and licensing decisions."
He leaned forward. "My adviser was right about you.
Can I put your name forward for membership on the board?"
I said yes, having no clue about what would be expected of
me or whether I'd be up to the task.


The Supervisors Rules Committee, chaired by Board President
John Molinari, confirmed the appointment of K. Shannon
Steele without objection, and I soon found myself sitting
on a board that approved, revised, or denied annual budgets
for alcoholism and substance abuse programs. Early on, I was
outraged when I saw how much money the county gave to the
Salvation Army. In my experience, I told the board, the Army
used its clients in recovery as unpaid labor. The organization
had not been helpful when I'd turned to it, as a homeless
man, for clothing or other assistance. I spoke passionately

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Shannon got the certificate, not you, said my voices. What
do you think the fine folks who honored Shannon would say if
they knew that you're a fraud? What army would you turn to
for salvation then? And who in the world would rescue you?</i>
The more my achievement, the greater my apprehension that
I'd be shown for who I really was: a high school dropout;
graduate not of Harvard, but of innumerable hospitals and
halfway houses; and an incurable <i>schizophrenic</i>. Daily, I lived
in dread of being discovered and publicly dishonored.


My fears were so great that I resigned from the CAAB
without explanation. I also left the residence, where I had
been promoted to head cook following Rob's departure to
open a similar residence club for international students. I
couldn't handle the added responsibility for many reasons,
including that my voices were rampant and that there was no
longer anyone around in whom I felt it was safe to confide.
Rob was gone and I was the boss. They needed me to be in
charge, but I was falling apart. Once again, I hit the streets
because the anguish of staying was too great. I yearned
for the anonymity of homelessness and found it back in the
Tenderloin district, where I prayed that someone--more
crazed than I--would fatally attack me. <i>(Please, God</i>, I

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the same time, I felt a paranoid fear of being recognized
by some of the prominent citizens alongside whom I
had recently worked. I decided to change my appearance and
visited a hairstyling school in the district, where I asked
them to make me a blond. (What they did, more accurately,
was turn my hair yellow--the bright color of yarn stitched
atop a rag doll. I will never forget the scalp pain caused by
sitting under terribly hot lights for hours with chemicals in
my hair.) The supervisors would not have recognized me. My
own mother would not have known me in this guise. She
wouldn't have wanted to.


For the next few weeks, I slept in doorways and parks. I
took occasional meals in a soup kitchen run by the Glide
Memorial Church, whose spiritual leader, the Reverend Cecil
Williams, was as gracious to this dirty, homeless man as to
the many important people who regularly turned to him for
guidance. (In fact, the reverend and I had met briefly when I
served as a member of the advisory board, but that was
before I hit the streets and before I had this mop of strange
hair.) He looked me in the eyes and he treated me well, finding
me small chores to do around the church in exchange for
shelter and an occasional payment.


I sank lower still. My home was an alley shared with two
to three other men and hundreds of imagined creatures,
theirs and mine. One evening, a short, thin man with big
round eyes intruded into the space that I occupied. "What
do you think you're doing here?" he said, as if he had a right
to be here but I did not. "The police are rounding up street
people tonight. Do you want to go to jail?"

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had never had my space so violated by anyone, not even
by other homeless men. I was addled and angry. "Who do
you think you are--Jesus Christ?" I growled.


"Nope," he said, extending his hand. "Steve Goldfinger.
I'm a doctor who can put you in a hospital where you can get
things sorted out. If nothing else, you'll have a bed and a few
hot meals for a couple of days."


"Medicine, too?" I asked, for I knew well what happened
in hospitals.


"Yeah, but I won't turn you into a vegetable," he
answered, understanding the reason for my concern.


"I'm known here," I whispered conspiratorially. "If I
agree to go with you, I need your promise that no one will be
called."


"I promise that everything will be confidential," he said.
"Will you let me admit you voluntarily?"


This was my first meeting with Stephen Mark Goldfinger,
M.D., whom I now count as one of my friends and allies in
the effort to gain better services and respect for people suffering
from mental illness. In 1981, when we met, he was
employed as the mental health director of the San Francisco
Health Care for the Homeless, which was attached to San
Francisco General Hospital. He's now a professor and vice
chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the State University
of New York. He says he doesn't recall our first meeting.
I know I'll never forget it.


Dr. Goldfinger had me admitted to General Hospital's psychiatric
unit, a locked facility. The scene was a familiar one:
patients overmedicated on Thorazine, Stelazine, and Haldol,
shuffling back and forth like zombies in a dance of the
bizarre. The carpeting, which reeked of tobacco, was covered

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You stay away from our audience," yelled the little
person.


"You smell so bad, you could scatter a bunch of hungry
pigeons and force them to fly away from a park where visitors
were feeding them bread crumbs," shouted his tall
friend.


I shook my head as if to clear it of hallucinatory images,
but the duo was real. They weren't wrong, either. I didn't
simply smell, I stank.


San Francisco General cleaned me up, put me back on
Trilafon, and released me to Northeast Lodge, a supervised,
locked residence with a day treatment program that offered
structured activities intended to help patients make the transition
from hospital to community. The idea was fine, but the
curriculum offered no challenge to anyone past the age of
five. My other option was to enroll in a program conducted
in Spanish. I doubt that it had more relevance to real-life
situations.


The Lodge was big on getting us out into the community,
mandating attendance at museums, movies, and parks, either
escorted or (once we were deemed responsible) in pairs or on
our own. My roommate was the tall blond man who worked
with the accordionist. He was actually a nice guy, and we
would hang out together sometimes. One afternoon when I
was granted a two-hour pass, I went to Fisherman's Wharf to
see him and his partner perform. The little man also played

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There were other means of earning money, the partners
soon taught me. One had to do with the testing of urine.
Patients returning from off-campus outings were mandated
to provide urine samples to be tested for drugs. Of course,
many patients requested passes just so they could go out and
get high. The musicians' advice was to sell the users my
drug-free urine, which they'd then pass off as their own. My
blond roommate was my very first customer. He was doing
cocaine. By the time I left Northeast Lodge, I had twelve
urine clients. But Sandy, a resident of the women's floor, had
an even more thriving business among both women and men
until the day that a routine urine check of male residents
turned up several who were pregnant. Sandy hadn't known
till then--nor had the administration--that she was in her
fourth month.


For no clear reason, except that I was bored and was
being prodded to get on with my death, I eloped from the
Lodge during one of our recreational trips, this one to Land's
End, a popular area with awesome cliffs that looked out at
the Pacific Ocean and down at sandy beaches tucked into
secret coves. I made my way to Route 1, a dangerous route on
which to hitchhike because of its many curves. A driver
swerving around a bend could easily miss seeing a pedestrian.
<i>If that happens, so be it</i>, I thought.


Instead, I was picked up by two guys in a Jeep, who
drove first to Los Angeles, then on to Palm Springs. I went
with them. Along the way, they talked of the dangers of the
high desert. They said there were rattlesnakes and scorpions.
Coyotes, running in packs, had recently been reported

My voices cheered. <i>Kenny's dying, Kenny's dying, Kenny's
dying. It's over, over, over ... and we've won</i>.


The sun beat down on me. In my mind's eye, I saw myself
lying on the rock where I'd been bitten when another rattler,
seven to eight feet in length, slithered over to me, then spoke
to me directly. <i>I'm your Moby Dick rattler</i>, he said, <i>and you
are my Ahab. You have been seeking me ever since the voices
first told you to kill yourself It was my fate to do the deed for
you. I now have to find and devour the rattler who poisoned you
so that he doesn't boast of his victory to the demons. He's not
the one to take credit. Your death belongs to me</i>.


The Moby Dick rattler took a big bite out of my jugular
vein, and a river of blood ran thick and swift from my neck.
<i>Just so there won't be any doubt about who's the victor</i>, said the
snake, <i>I'll carry your head with my jaw prints in it to the
demons so that I can claim my bounty. But that comes later. For
now, I have ordered a band of coyotes to watch over you while I
go to devour that other rattler</i>. I looked around. Three fierce,
snarling, salivating coyotes stood over me. Moving off, the
huge snake glanced back to where I lay and said, <i>You could
say "Thank you," you know. Your misery on earth ends here.
Now you, too, can become a demon voice. You can guide others
the way your demons have been guiding you</i>.

"Mr. Steele!" I ignored the woman's voice calling my name.
"Mr. Steele!" It was even more demanding. I shut my eyes
so tight, I thought my eyeballs would pop out of their sockets.
"Mr. Steele!" This time, the voice was accompanied by a
firm touch; the speaker was shaking me. If I were dead,
could I feel her touch? Was this another hallucination? Did
the voice belong to an animal disguised as a woman? If a
delusion, what did this she-devil want with me? If real ... if
I was still alive, did I want to come back and be faced with
my ever-present voices, my lifelong companions, my hell on
earth?


I opened my eyes and saw a nurse and doctor standing
over me. "Well, Mr. Steele, you just made it," said the doctor.
"You were bitten three times by a rattler." I wondered if the
third bite was by Moby Dick. "No," said the doctor, when I
asked about the jugular vein. "If you'd been bitten there, it
would have meant instant death." He told me that I'd also
been bitten by a coyote that was being tracked by several
hunters. They were the ones who found me lying on the
rock, still breathing.


"Good thing it was some good ol' boys who knew what
they were doing," said the doctor. "They did all the right
things and got you here to Desert Hospital as quick as a
jackrabbit. You can thank those men and the good Lord for
being alive."


<i>You can curse those men</i>, said my voices. <i>Damn those men,
damn the doctor, damn everybody to hell</i>. The voices were
furious.


I looked past the glass pane of the door to my hospital
room and saw a security guard. "What's he here for?"

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Well, Mr. Steele," said the doctor, introducing himself,
"I'm Dr. Winslow and I'm a psychiatrist. You expressed a lot
of suicidal thoughts when you were delirious with fever. You
also told the men who found you that you wanted to die and
asked them to leave you to the vultures. The guard is there to
see that you don't do harm to yourself. I've committed you to
observation at Loma Linda Medical Center. They have a first-rate
psychiatric unit. I think you will thank me for this
someday."


"Thank you? Who are you to interfere?" I shouted at the
man. "Get out and don't come back!"


I was placed in four-point leather restraints that held me
firm to the hospital bed. The next morning, the ambulance
drivers removed me to a gurney, and, still restrained, I was
taken to Loma Linda, a teaching hospital run by Seventh-Day
Adventists. MediCal, California's version of Medicaid,
was paying for my stay. While here, I received a permanent
MediCal card, essential for an indigent person to access
needed services in this state.


I began my stay in seclusion, with the door open and a
one-to-one suicide staff member assigned to me. Soon I was
free to walk about the unit, a clean, pleasant area with lots of
room to roam. My aide stayed with me. Just as the hospitals
had their routines, so did I. I fell silent--speaking to no one,
not the admissions clerk, not the medical resident who introduced
himself to me, not the other patients. It was my normal
way of responding to abnormal feelings of deepest
depression: case the joint and say nothing. Had the staff not
been provided with my records from Desert Hospital, they
could well have thought I was mute. I refused food and lost
thirty pounds in three and a half weeks. I refused to let any

<i>Do it, do it, do it</i>, they chanted. <i>Get electrocuted! Do it this
time before it's too late!</i> Then I heard the commanding voice
of The Ruler: <i>Do it or the pains you will suffer on the streets
and in the hospitals will be so horrid, you'll be praying for the
chance to be shocked out of existence</i>. His was the voice that
brought me close to the edge.


I underwent nine shock treatments. I was talking and
eating again. I had little memory of recent events and the
roles that people had played in them. The voices returned
immediately--they'd never really left--proving ECT's ineffectiveness
in treating the type of paranoia and command
hallucinations I was experiencing. Command hallucinations
are auditory instructions that tell people to act in a certain
way. These instructions can range from the trivial--<i>Wear a
red shirt</i>--to demands to commit a harmful act. Over half of
command hallucinations are to commit suicide, which my
voices constantly egged me on to do. In some few cases (but
never in my own experience), the person receives instructions
to hurt others.


My depression did lift, however, and I stopped thinking
of suicide all the time.


Loma Linda discharged me to an L facility--<i>L</i> being short
for long-term stay. The site was a former nursing home. We
men lived two, three, and four to a room in an environment

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I located a dark, narrow bar on a side alley and went in,
hoping to find some chips or nuts in a dish on the counter.
Frequently, I could find someone to buy me a drink. If I
struck it lucky, I might get a burger and fries. I looked over
the clientele and spotted someone who seemed familiar.
Another delusion? The man looked up, smiled, and said, "Hi,
Shannon. What are you doing here?" It was Junior. He wasn't
in uniform and he was tying on one hell of a drunk, but
you would still mistake him for "Gopher." I needed sleep and
a shower more than food and drink, so I asked if he had a
place where I could stay for a night or two. "Sure," he said.
He would have said sure or nope or anything anybody
wanted, he was that drunk.


I helped him to his feet, and we took a cab to a private
house in El Cajon, California, just outside of San Diego. I figured
that this was his home away from the naval base. I got
him to bed, then I showered and crashed on the sofa, where I
slept until midafternoon of the next day. Junior was gone
when I awoke, but he'd left me a note saying that he'd return
at six. That evening, when he came home from work, I
learned what he now did during the day. Junior had been
discharged from the service and was employed as a sanitation
worker for the Port of San Diego.


I spent a couple of weeks with Junior, but he wasn't Karl.
I didn't care enough to help him from one binge to another. I

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I awoke in a strange bed. Somebody had brought me to
his home. This time, my body worked out my escape. I experienced
some kind of medical event, very much like a heart
attack, and was rushed to Castle Hospital in Kaneohe,
Hawaii, on the other side of the Pali Highway that separates
Waikiki from Kaneohe. The diagnosis was a major asthmatic
attack, but my erratic behavior was such that a psychiatric
consult had been ordered, which then led to my being transferred
to the hospital's psychiatric unit. By this time, I could
write a book: <i>The Schizophrenic's Coast-to-Coast Guide to Psychiatric
Institutions and Halfway Houses</i>. As I improved (I
never recovered; I just was able at times to better control my
behavior), I once again became a candidate for a halfway
house and was accepted by one called The House, at the top
of Sierra Drive in Honolulu, with an incredible view of
Diamond Head, downtown Waikiki, and rainbows that
spanned the horizon each and every day. I lived in Hawaii
for three years, a period in which I was even less able to
manage my disease because my physical health seriously
deteriorated.

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Since the asthma attack, I was put on prednisone and
took a daily dose for almost two years. My face blew up to
the point where I had to search for my neck; I looked like a
chipmunk. There was oxygen and a nebulizer at the ready in
my room, in case I experienced trouble breathing. The prednisone
made me manic. It also made me gain weight. I shot
up from 230 to 400 pounds and was in and out of Queens
Medical Center with pneumonia. I was too sick, too old (in
my mid-thirties, I felt aged as Methuselah), and had too
many medical problems to look for a job as a cook, orderly,
or anything else. I was hanging around The House all day,
which wasn't acceptable to the administration. They told me
to find something to occupy my time.


And so one day I went down to the Diamond Head Mental
Health Center and asked if there was anything I could do.
I thought I might put in some hours as a receptionist or do
something else, like address envelopes, where I'd be able to
sit at a desk. After I'd been volunteering at the center's
Office of Community Support for a short time, the social
worker came up to me. "I want to start some self-help groups
that are culturally sensitive to the various groups in the
area," she said. At about this time, Hawaii had very few peer-run
programs. "How would you like to do some research on
what's available on the mainland?" It sounded interesting.


She told me how to do a literature review and had me
look into AA programs and other peer-directed groups. It
started out as a small effort. I think the center's staff knew
that I liked to read and thought that, in looking at self-help
for others, I might begin to help myself. The more I read, the
more I began to think about what might be helpful for <i>mental
health consumers</i> like me. This was a new term and a new

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I ended up writing a pretty nice paper. I also started a
group at The House called <i>Ho'omaka Hou</i> (for New Beginnings)
for people to come together, share their stories and
concerns, and find direction for their lives. (Ironically, it
proved not to be a new beginning for me.) I then found out
there were similar self-help groups (with names like Recovery,
Inc.) in other communities in Hawaii and felt that one
umbrella organization could coordinate the several efforts
and be more successful in effecting change. Someone told me
that I ought to write a grant and present it to the Hawaii
house and senate. I did, and with the help of the social
worker and others who looked over the outline and made
suggestions, we won major legislative funding ($60,000),
plus office space for the initiative, called the Office of United
Self-Help, which still exists.


All this activism brought me to the attention of Governor
George Ariyoshi, who appointed me as the first mental health
consumer to serve on the State Council on Mental Health. In
July 1984, he also sent me, as Hawaii's representative, to the

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What no one who saw or dealt with me during this period
knew was that my voices had been out of control all along
and that I'd continued to live in an increasingly delusional
world. I was still K. Shannon Steele, still a graduate of
Harvard, still someone who'd served as primary adviser to
Dianne Feinstein. Along the way, I added a few more trophies
to my shelf. I never told my own psychiatrist or anyone
associated with me about who I really was or what my real
illness was all about. I continued to say that I was an orphan,
continued to insist that I suffered from depression over the
loss of a lover, continued to deny the severity and reality of
my schizophrenia. A part of me believed everything I told
others: In my heart of hearts, Dianne Feinstein was my good
friend; Harvard was a great school, but not as difficult as
people assumed. This public me could get up and speak and
move others to action, while the private me cowered from the
voices that knew and proclaimed the truth: <i>Why stop at
Dianne Feinstein?</i> they taunted me. <i>Why not claim you're a
good friend of President Reagan? That Nancy has had you to
tea? Liar, liar</i>, they shouted. <i>The world will find you out</i>.


The burden of it all, illness and guilt, proved too much.
The better known I became, the worse were my fears of
being discovered. Moving on made no sense, but I wasn't
being governed by sense. I knew only that I had to get as far
away from Hawaii as possible--and that meant New York.
And so I flew back to familiar territory and a well-worn
script. Once again, I walked the streets of the city, sleeping
on park benches or in any space that could accommodate me.

In the late 1980s, I was back where I began, in a psychiatric
hospital on Wards Island.


And I paced the floor.
