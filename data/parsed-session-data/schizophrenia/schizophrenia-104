<b>M</b>ANHATTAN STATE HOSPITAL, on Wards Island, had been
renamed Manhattan Psychiatric Center in the early
1970s to make clearer its mission: the treatment of people
with mental illness. Although I plainly fit the category, I'd
found it hard to gain entrance to the hospital this time
around because New York State had been systematically
cutting the number of beds available to mental patients.
And so I spent eight weeks under close observation on one
of Roosevelt Hospital's Psychiatric Tower units. There I
underwent one "utilization review" after another to
demonstrate that I remained a danger to myself. Had it not
been for the chief psychiatric resident's tenacious efforts to
hold me on the unit at Roosevelt until a place at Manhattan
Psychiatric became available, I would have been sent out to
the streets weeks earlier, left to fend for myself in a world
filled with danger.

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Others were not so lucky. Increasingly, psychiatric
patients (many dangerous to themselves or to others) were
being discharged when their Medicaid coverage ran out after
only three or four weeks' treatment. They were handed a
ten-day supply of medication and a list of public shelters,
which even the mad knew to be hostile places. Settling in
stairwells and on sidewalks, this throwaway population drew
attention only when it was seen as a public nuisance (like the
squeegee men who swoop down on stopped cars to beg loose
change of irritated drivers) or when some tragically crazed
man or woman, off medication, made headlines by committing
a violent act. And so I was grateful when Manhattan
Psychiatric Center accepted me.


It didn't take long to see that more than the institution's
name had changed since the last time I'd stayed here. Meyer
2-G, a locked unit in the new building to which I'd been
assigned, was co-ed! My first concern, however, was keeping
my pants up--and not because there were women on the
ward. The hospital's clothing store held little that was large
enough to fit me, and I became heir to two pairs of oversized
pants and two shirts that had belonged to a patient even
more obese than I. Because I'd been placed on suicide watch,
I was not allowed to wear a belt or suspenders and had to
walk around holding my pants up with both hands. <i>Look at
what a fat pig you've become</i>, the voices derided me. <i>Fat pig
has been taken to the slaughterhouse. Chop off his head!</i>


I was assigned to a room next to the nurses' station so I
could be closely observed. I saw this as a vast improvement
over being placed in four-point restraints and held in isolation.
But other aspects of this incarceration, which lasted
about a year and a half, were very troubling. For one thing,

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I managed to stay out of most of these clashes. I have never
mistrusted people because of the color of their skin. I became
paranoid only when the voices would whisper, <i>Watch out for
that fellow in the corner; he's got a knife in his hand</i> (when in
fact he was raising his finger), or when they'd warn, <i>Be careful
of that nurse; she's giving you poison</i> (and it was only medicine).
The "higher" a ward would become (meaning the more
dangerous it was), the greater were my efforts to step outside
of my surroundings. Even when things were relatively calm, I
felt as if I were communicating with people through a gauze
barrier that separated me and my voices from the real world.
When things grew tense, I'd simply lower that curtain and
retreat into books (whenever possible) in an effort to keep the
voices at bay. But the hospital staff had a different objective, I
soon learned. Many were dedicated to keeping us hospitalized
as a means of retaining their jobs.


"Generations of my family have worked here," I overheard
a gray-haired senior aide tell two young staff members,
"and now my own son can't be hired unless someone retires,
goes on disability, or dies." She went on to explain that there
was a movement, in New York and elsewhere, to close state
hospitals and send "these crazies" back into the community.
"If they are here, we need to keep them here," she said definitively.


She was talking about acute psychiatric cases (like many
patients on our unit) as well as the "chronic" and "refractory"
types who'd been banished to the back wards of Dunlap, the

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I settled back into institutional life, where the constant
activity of my voices (sometimes loud, more often chattering
away in the background) was even welcome, because it
served as a minor distraction from the boredom, the mind-numbing
monotony of day-to-day existence on the ward.
From 6:00 A.M., when we were awakened, until 6:00 P.M.
(showers and bed), there was little for us patients to do but
play cards, chess, or checkers, fantasize, find something from
a meager store of books to read (for some reason, every hospital
had a copy of William Shirer's <i>The Rise and Fall of the
Third Reich</i>; I must have read it five or six times from cover to
cover), pace the floors, or watch television. Another notable
change on this ward was that the TV wasn't going all the time
but was placed in a separate room where those who wanted
to watch could do so, and others like me could keep their
distance. On Saturday mornings, a program called <i>Soul Train</i>,
featuring favored rap and pop music artists, played to a
standing-room-only crowd.


For those without off-ward privileges, the major events of
the day were mealtimes: breakfast at 7:00, lunch at 11:00,
and dinner at 4:00. We'd line up long before the dining room
opened, even though the food was notoriously bad: steamed,

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00183&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Two or three times a day, as well, we'd be expected to line
up for meds. I was being given medical drugs plus a pill to
lower my blood pressure and, I think, a diuretic, because I
found myself going to the bathroom with great frequency.
From time to time, the people dispensing medication would
call out "Mouth inspection," and the patients would have to
open wide. Woe to anyone caught "tonguing" pills--the
medication would then be given in liquid form. Before I left
the hospital, many patients were being injected with the
antipsychotic medications Prolixin and Haldol. There was no
way to tongue those.


Group therapy sessions were held several times a week.
I'd shuffle over to where the group was sitting--eight or ten
patients to a doctor--just because it was something to do.
Then I'd sit there commenting, in conspiratorial fashion, on
what others were saying.


"How did you feel about the visit from your family?" the
doctor asked one of the women in the group.


"Well, I'm worried about my daughter," she replied.


Then <i>I</i> interjected, "Ha! She thinks that her children still
remember her...." People who knew me then tell me that I'd

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The first patient to greet me soon after I arrived on this
ward was Paul, a fellow in his early thirties who stood just
my height and weighed half as much as I did. Actually, Paul
didn't so much greet me as tell me his name and then slump
into a chair next to mine, where he sat without uttering
another word. A couple of hours later, he rose, said, "Been
nice talking with you," and disappeared.


I was startled by both his coming and his going, for I had
been preoccupied with my demons, actively listening to
their endless chattering about the necessity of my death and
the manner in which I could carry it out in this place. Coward,
they called me. <i>Chicken</i>, they said. <i>You haven't the guts to
kill yourself</i>. The voices divided themselves into choral sections.
One group chanted, <i>Who's afraid to kill himself, kill
himself kill himself?</i> And the other responded, <i>It's fat Kenny</i>.
For the first time in a long while, I found myself talking back
to them. "Who are you calling a coward?" I shouted, my
voice rising to the challenge. "Just dare to show me who you
are and we'll see which of us is the stronger and braver." I'd
taken Golden Gloves boxing as a young adolescent, and I
jumped up (dropping my pants), assumed a fighting stance,
and began throwing blows against an unseen enemy.

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00185&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next thing I knew, I was being punched in the face
by a fellow patient, a big black man who believed that my
words had been directed at him. "That's for Yusef," he
shouted as he hit my nose with an uppercut. (Yusef Hawkins
was a black youth who had recently been beaten to death by
white guys in a neighborhood known as Bensonhurst,
in Brooklyn.) The blow fractured my nose. I struggled to
fight back, signaling the beginning of a free-for-all. The
attendants--including one assigned to guard me on suicide
watch--observed the melee and did nothing. More men
joined the attack on me, and the noise level rose as the fighting
continued.


At some point, someone must have given me an injection,
for I woke in a padded seclusion room, lying on a bare, thin
mattress. I sat up, startled, then dropped to the side, my head
hitting the cold marble floor. It was not the first time this
had happened. I believed that the sleep disruptions and falls
I was experiencing were the work of my voices; they were
trying to make me break my head open and die. The hospital
staff decided that the falls were inept attempts at suicide,
much like the cuts and scratches that some patients make on
their wrists without severing an artery. As it turns out, we
were both wrong.


To be on the safe side, the staff restrained me in bed each
evening. Many a night I would wake up, gasping for breath
and unable to move. It felt as if someone were sitting on top
of my chest. As I struggled to sit up, I felt a burning sensation
from the leather straps that held my wrists and ankles
fast. The more I pulled on the straps, the tighter they
became. I called out for help. "I can't breathe," I told the
attendant who finally responded.

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"It's all in your head," he replied, dismissing my complaint.
(This was a common response to patients' reports of
physical discomfort or pain, not just at Manhattan Psychiatric,
but at other hospitals that housed the mentally ill.)


Nor did I fare any better with the attending medical residents,
who wanted nothing more than to make it through
this unwelcome rotation in their medical education and move
on. As far as they were concerned, I could go on banging my
head against the floor. And, night after night, that was just
what I did.


<i>What if I die?</i> I wondered, for I had known patients to
"disappear" during the night--never to be heard of again.
Any questions about their whereabouts were met by silence
from the staff. This ignorance of the fate of those who'd disappeared
fed the patients' paranoia. I wanted to die, but I didn't
want to just fade away--and my nightly struggles to breathe
had me terrified into thinking that could happen. I had no visitors,
no family to care what happened to me. One morning, as
Paul and I waited on line for the powdered eggs that were that
day's fare, I turned to him and hastily whispered, "Paul, I need
a favor from you. If I'm not here one morning and just disappear,
call the police and tell them there was a conspiracy by
the staff to have me suffocate to death. Will you do that?"


Paul nodded solemnly. "I promise," he said.


Christmas and New Year's came and went with little fanfare
on Meyer 2-G--and with no change in my situation. It
was early 1990, and I was still being denied ground privileges,
which meant that I was also prevented from applying
for a job in one of the buildings on campus and earning the
money that I needed to buy coffee and cigarettes. And so I
turned to a trade I knew: selling my urine. Patients would

[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00187&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the spring, I was finally taken off suicide watch and
granted permission to go outside. I found a paying job as an
assistant in the medical library, located in Dunlap. Here I was
surrounded by journals and books, and I learned how to use
WordPerfect on the computer. At first, I found the keyboard
confusing and would gaze for hours at a blank blue screen.
But I was given a manual and practice time, and eventually I
became proficient in the computer's use. I also learned how
to create and maintain alpha and numeric filing systems. It
was responsible work and much better than the mindless
assembly-line work, like putting plastic dinnerware and napkins
into see-through containers, that was usually offered
hospital patients.


I spent many of my off-duty hours with Paul, who clung
to me like a shadow. "I'm here on orders from John Gotti to
keep an eye on the blacks," he whispered to me early on in
our acquaintance. (Paul and I were two of the three white
males on the ward.) "He sent you here to check up on me,
didn't he?"


"John who?" I said. I had never heard of the man, but
Paul filled me in on the exploits and power of the notorious
underworld leader.


"I'm Gotti's right-hand man," he confided. "They're all
scared of me around here."

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00188&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wasn't scared, and in all other respects Paul proved an
amiable companion, guiding and encouraging me on my first
foray into the city on a pass from the hospital. We saw a
movie, <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>, and had pizza... just like
normal people. Then we returned to Meyer and had our
urine tested.


"My mom's coming to take me out to brunch this weekend,"
Paul told me one day. "Request a pass for Sunday so
you can join us."


I hesitated. I didn't want to break in on family time; but
Paul persisted, and so I agreed to join them "just this once,"
which quickly became every other Sunday. We would go to a
restaurant on Manhattan's East Side that featured an all-you-can-eat
buffet. Paul's mom treated me like a second son, even
to the point of offering to provide me with a weekly
allowance. I declined. I suffered many delusions over the
years, especially believing that the world revolved around
me, but I would not permit myself the deception of thinking
that Paul and his mother were my family. The very notion of
<i>family</i> caused me pain, for though I pretended to others that
my mother and father were dead, I knew that I had real parents
and a real brother living in Connecticut. I also knew
that I was on my own.


Before I could be placed in a community rehabilitation
and housing program, I needed to file an application for Supplemental
Security Income (SSI). Coverage by this program
would financially support the move to housing. This was an
important first step toward leaving the hospital; without SSI,
I would also not have the Medicaid coverage to pay for clinic
visits, qualify for day treatment programs, or have prescriptions
filled.

[p. <i>173</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00189&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My many efforts to meet with the social worker who
could help me were frustrated. Whenever I arrived at his
office for a scheduled meeting, he wasn't there. Sorry, he'd
tell me later. He was either away from his desk or on vacation.
He kept changing appointments. Was this a plot? Along
with my regular voices, the words of the gray-haired aide,
<i>We need to keep the crazies here</i>, kept drumming in my ears. Is
that what the social worker was trying to do--keep me
there?


I complained to the head nurse of the unit. "The social
worker won't see me," I said.


"I'll look into it," she promised.


Several weeks went by without any word, except from
the new voice in my head: <i>If he's here</i> ... Over and over
again I heard it: ... <i>we need to keep him here</i>.


Desperate, I asked one of the medical residents to investigate
the situation. "I need to see a social worker," I said, "or
I'll be doomed to live out my days in this place." The resident
found the record of all the broken appointments and brought
them to the attention of the chief psychiatrist. From then on,
my social worker was in when I called! Together, he and
I filled out and filed the requisite paperwork. Finally, I
was able to move on to a rehabilitation program in the
community.


Fountain House, the program to which I was assigned, is
located on West Forty-seventh Street in the area of Manhattan
known as Hell's Kitchen, where I'd previously lived. On
my first visit, it looked a lot closer to heaven than hell. The
entrance room was furnished with the kind of old sofas and
chairs that give one the feeling of home; vases of fresh-cut
flowers were placed about. A man came forward to greet me.

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00190&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Clubhouses are gathering places for people with serious
and persistent mental illness, where they receive much-needed
emotional support and some sort of vocational training.
Working (for free) with staff at this well-endowed, nonprofit
organization was seen as part of the job of recovery.


Ronnie led me through a brief tour of several units:
reception, orientation, clerical, education, maintenance, horticulture,
kitchen, dining room, snack bar, housing, and
administration. The idea of working with plants and flowers
was appealing. I also felt an instant rapport with Bodil
Drescher Anaya, the Danish-born horticultural therapist
who ran the unit. The choice was easy.


The first several weeks, I continued to live at Manhattan
Psychiatric Center, commuting an hour and a half to my volunteer
job at Fountain House in the morning, then returning
to the hospital, where I worked, afternoons, in the medical
library--my sole source of much-needed income. <i>You'll never
make it on the outside</i>, said my voices, who rode with me on
the buses, stood beside me on the subway platform, waited
with me at red lights and crossed with me on the green. <i>Wait
and see. ... You'll run again ... and hide, but we'll find you,
they predicted. Wherever you are, we will be there, too. We're
the best friends you have, Kenny. Don't you know that by now?
How much more will it take for you to realize that your destiny
is to fail at everything except killing yourself?</i>


I worked in spite of my delusional voices and because of
them: I was going to prove them wrong. One afternoon, I

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00191&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By everyone's assessment, I was ready to move out of
Manhattan Psychiatric Center, but there were no appropriate
vacancies in any of the residences managed by Fountain
House. Instead, I was discharged to something called a three-quarter-way
house on the grounds of Wards Island. Twenty-eight
days was the maximum length of stay here. During that
time, I was expected to get my housing and discharge plans
organized and completed. I was also required to check into a
state outpatient clinic, where I'd meet with a social worker
and psychiatrist once a week and receive the Trilafon I was
then taking.


The only hard part of moving out of Manhattan Psychiatric
was leaving Paul behind. I had hoped he would join me
at Fountain House, but he was afraid of leaving the place
where he had spent most of his adolescence and (but for
brief periods at home) all of his adult life. Like so many others,
Paul had grown dependent on the mental health system
to monitor his behavior and meet his everyday needs. It's an
all-too-common scenario: The loss of self-esteem that accompanies
mental illness leads to dependence on medicines, alcohol,
doctors, intermittent hospitalizations, clubhouses,
halfway houses, SSI ... round about and back again. There is

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00192&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I tried to explain to Paul that Fountain House was an
extension of that system. "This clubhouse is just like a hospital,"
I told him on a sunny afternoon the day before I was
to leave. "The whole idea of the place is to protect you as
part of a core community where everyone lives, works, eats,
and socializes together. You can depend on them." But Paul
would have none of it, or of me, either. From that day on, he
would not join me for a movie, would not meet me for a
pizza, would even refuse to take my phone calls. The senior
aide's words reverberated through my head: <i>We need to keep
the crazies here</i>. She had won a victory with Paul.


As part of my job in the horticulture unit, I was assigned to a
weekend at High Point Farm in Montague, New Jersey.
Owned by Fountain House, this was a working farm with
cattle, horses, pigs, chickens, and a large vegetable garden.
Alec, who also volunteered in the horticulture unit, and I
were to help plant the spring crop. This was my first meeting
with Alec. In the evening, our chores done, we would sit
together on the guest house patio, gaze out at the new-green
lawn, at the giant trees coming back to life, at the expanse of
starlit sky, and talk about our lives.


"I can't believe that I, a schizophrenic who lives on Wards
Island, am sitting in this glorious place," I said. "If it's a delusion,
I don't want any medication that will make it go away."


Alec laughed. "How do you get back and forth to work?"
he asked.

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00193&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I told him about the two buses, the train, the long walk
from the station, followed, hours later, by the return trip. He
said that he had his own apartment near Fountain House
headquarters and invited me to stay over whenever I
wanted.


After we returned to the city, I took him up on his offer.
Alec's story bore many similarities to my own, including
hearing voices and experiencing multiple hospitalizations.
He liked tales filled with fantasy and introduced me to <i>Star
Wars, Star Trek</i>, and <i>The Never-Ending Story</i>. Finally, Fountain
House found a supportive apartment for me in a doorman
building at West End Avenue and 102nd Street. The
apartment was huge. I had three roommates; two had their
own quarters, and I shared a room with the third. It wasn't a
bad arrangement, but then Alec invited me to move into his
place. He liked having me around, he said. It kept him from
being alone with his voices.


The move was right for several reasons, mostly that Alec
and I got along so well. I also liked the fact that it gave me
some measure of independence. I wasn't comfortable with
Fountain House being my day treatment program, my
employer, and my landlord. I cut one string of dependency,
and it felt good.


Then I tried to cut a few others. One day, I phoned the SSI
office and asked them to cancel my application for benefits,
the application I'd spent so much time completing. I didn't
need to be part of a system, I said. I could work for my
income. I told myself that I didn't need Medicaid or medications,
either. Didn't I have two jobs, one apartment, a good
friend? I could go to the movies when I wished, could read
any book that I wanted.... When the voices were especially

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00194&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This sort of false confidence sabotages the recovery of
many a person who suffers from mental illness, and I was no
different. In fact, my sense of well-being was short-lived.
Descending to the subway station at Eighth Avenue and
Twenty-third Street on my way to work one morning, I was
jostled by a group of teenaged boys who came charging
down the stairs. Thrown off-balance, I thrust my left hand
out to stop from going straight into a wall and suffered a
compound fracture of my arm from elbow to wrist. At the
hospital, doctors placed my arm in a cast, but the greater
damage to me was psychological. I became convinced that
the boys had been in cahoots with my voices, that they had
purposely tried to harm me--to get the fat man--and that
they'd try again. For a week after my accident, someone from
the horticulture unit would have to accompany me to work
and someone else would arrive at quitting time to ride home
with me. I was <i>that</i> scared. But I continued to go to my job
each day, and I believed I was doing well.


So I was totally unprepared when the copy room supervisor,
a young black man, stopped by my station one day and
said, "In a day or so, Fountain House will be bringing someone
over for you to train."


"Oh?" I said, my heart racing.


"Your time will be up in two weeks," he said matter-of-factly.

[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Why was I being let go? What had I done wrong? I
thought back to my job at Fairchild Publications, when I had
first arrived in New York. After all these years, I was back in
the city, practically around the corner from where I'd lived
so long ago, and I was being fired again. I began to see old
demons--Nick, Ted--stalking me.


Distraught, I went to talk to Bodil at Fountain House.
Early on in my placement at NRDC, my employer had contacted
Bodil and asked her to do something about my personal
hygiene--I'd been rushing off to work without showering,
and I smelled. She'd handled the matter gently.
"Sweetheart, you have to make sure you're washed and clean
before you leave your place," she'd said, and I didn't have to
be told twice. I hoped she could make things right again.


As usual, Bodil was surrounded by people. I waited for a
private moment and then told her without preamble, "They
fired me."


She looked straight at me. "What do you mean, sweetie?"
she asked. "What did you do?"


"I don't know," I said. "They're having someone come in
to train for my job."


"Oh, no, sweetie, you're not being fired," Bodil said. She
explained, "The job belongs to Fountain House, not to you.
You've been there six months, now it's time for someone else
to be trained. You'll come back here, hang around for a
while, then we'll get you another job."


Bodil's explanation notwithstanding, my heart was broken.
I had liked the work and welcomed the money. Within
days, I became confused, disoriented, and easy prey for the
voices, which told me again and again what a terrible failure
I was. I began drinking heavily and at all hours in a vain

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00196&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt like Jell-O, couldn't keep a thought in my head for a
minute, and would sit for long intervals, smoking, drooling,
and dozing. I also quickly began drinking again to still the
voices. One weekend, I disappeared. Alec went looking for
me in one neighborhood beer joint after another. "What are
you doing to yourself?" he demanded when he finally located
me in a sleazy bar on Eighth Avenue. I couldn't answer. What
I was doing, I knew as well as he, was destroying myself,
dashing all that I had worked to achieve. "You don't want to
go back to the hospital, do you?" he asked, looking straight
into my bloodshot eyes. "Take a really hard look at these people
around you," he said. I did. They were the usual sorry
types--drifters, homeless types, guys on the make. "Is <i>this</i>
how you see yourself?" Alec asked. "Is <i>this</i> what you want?"


I began to listen. Somebody cared, really cared about
what happened to me. "No, I don't think so," I said haltingly.


"Then let's call Bodil and get you some help," Alec said,
and we made the call.


"I'll go with you to the SSI office tomorrow and we'll
reapply for benefits," Bodil said after I told her what was

[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00197&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At eight the next morning, Bodil and I told my story to a
clerk. We expected to have to begin the application procedure
anew, a time-consuming operation, and were surprised
and delighted when the clerk entered my Social Security
number into the computer and found that my SSI application
had been approved the previous month. I had one retroactive
check waiting (because they had no address for me), and the
others would be sent to me monthly. "You're eligible to
receive Medicaid immediately," said the clerk. "All you need
is proof of a correct mailing address."


"But what about my phone call canceling the application
for SSI?" I blurted out.


"That's not the way to cancel an application," he told me.
"How would anyone know that was really you on the phone?"


God had sent another of his angels. I supplied the necessary
paper and received a temporary Medicaid card in the
mail two days later.


Over the next year, I continued to room with Alec but felt a
growing need for a place with my own name on the lease. I
found a two-bedroom apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn,
obtained the necessary supported housing subsidy approval,
and moved in with another member of the horticulture unit.
Alec and I continued to meet socially and spend many memorable
weeks and weekends working at High Point Farm. I'd
never before tasted anything as sweet as corn that I ate the
same day I picked it, never eaten tomatoes off the vine until I
worked in the fields at Montague. It was hard work, but it
came well rewarded.

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00198&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had another job as well. My new transitional employment
placement, via Fountain House, was in the mail room at
the <i>Village Voice</i>, a counterculture weekly with a diverse and
devoted readership. I liked the people at the <i>Voice</i>, but the
atmosphere was hectic. I soon found myself being given
responsibilities outside the mail room--assisting the classifieds
staff, running credit cards for approval, handling
phones, and doing other office work. One night late in
March, after working long hours helping to get the paper on
press, I was standing on the subway platform, waiting for
the F train that would take me home to Brooklyn. I was
exhausted and tense. Suddenly, my voices began to accost
me, shrieking in my ears as the subway roared into the
station.


<i>Working man ... working slave</i>, they wailed. <i>Think you're
somebody special because they asked you to stay late? You're
special because you come cheap. Face it, Kenny, you're a
loser.... Jump off the platform, and the newspaper will still be
published without you. Take one, two, three steps toward the
edge. See the rails? It's the third rail you want, Kenny. The third
rail will do the job.... Jump and they'll write about it in the
paper. Jump now!</i>


Was it my exhaustion? The late hour? Had someone at the
paper said something to touch off this assault from within? It
could have been any of these things or all of them that threw
me off-balance. I usually boarded the second or third car of
the train because they were closest to the exit near my home.
This time, dazed and disoriented, I stumbled along the platform
and entered a car toward the rear. When I got off the
train at my stop, nothing was familiar. I felt totally lost--as if
I'd never seen the station before. No one looked safe.

[p. <i>183</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00199&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A group of teenaged boys were headed in my direction,
and I began breathing hard. They would hurt me. I knew it.
They would push me against a wall. Like the last time, they'd
break my arm. This time, they'd succeed in killing me. The
voices agreed. <i>They're out to get you, Kenny</i>, they shouted in
warning, and began to laugh their maniacal laughter. Panicked,
I backed away through an exit and found myself
trapped in a small, enclosed area. This part of the station was
unmanned by a transit clerk at night; the entrance was
closed. The young men had moved on without even a glance
in my direction. I was alone behind a barred gate, much as I
had been years before at Pueblo State Hospital. I began to
sweat. My voices taunted me with experiences of years past.
They carried me to every solitary room, every confinement I
had ever been in. They had me back at the rape scene, and I
heard myself begging, "Please, help me, somebody help me."
But the walls did not answer.


Hours later, a transit guard making his rounds discovered
me huddled in a corner. I'd stopped crying and sat hugging
my chest for warmth and solace ... and to control the
tremors that periodically coursed through my body. "You all
right in there, fella?" the guard called to me. "Need help?
Want me to call the police?"


"No," I said, trying to sound calm although my heart was
racing. From past experience, I could imagine what would
happen if the police were summoned. I'd find myself on the
way to a hospital. But I knew something else this time. <i>I
understood that I could stop that from happening!</i> It was amazing
to realize that I wasn't just being driven by my voices but
that I had some say over what happened to me. Though the
voices were still with me--even as I spoke to the guard--I

[p. <i>184</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00200&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He did. And I did.


When I returned home, I mulled over the evening's events:
the paralyzing paranoia and then ... that one, wonderful
moment when I managed to override the voices. I desperately
wanted more such moments. At the very core of me, I knew
that I had to get help--a good doctor, more effective medicine,
I didn't know what--if I was to have any hope of getting
better. (I never considered the possibility of getting
<i>well</i>, but <i>better</i> suddenly seemed a not-altogether-impossible
goal.) I don't remember what medication I was then taking,
but it wasn't working. The voices continued to dominate
every moment of my waking consciousness.


Desperate to find a more effective treatment, I signed in at
the outpatient clinic at Roosevelt Hospital. This was not my
first time there. At each visit, I'd see a different doctor. This
time, the doctor was a man in his late thirties--too old to be an
intern, I thought. He was clean shaven, had a full head of dark
brown hair, and might have seemed pleasant enough, except
that he looked bored. Without asking about my history (what
medicines I'd been given, their different effects on me), he
took out a pad and wrote out his prescription: Cogentin.


"I can't read when I'm on Cogentin," I told him after I'd
looked at the prescription.


"The medicine is more important than reading," he
responded flatly, turning away from me and beginning to

[p. <i>185</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sick as I was, I was not going to tolerate this. I looked
elsewhere for help, asking around for suggestions as to
where I might go and whom I might see. Bonnie Bean, housing
director at Fountain House and a woman who knows
how to get things done, placed a call to a colleague who recommended
a therapist and clinic near my home in Brooklyn.
That phone call turned out to be the most important call of
my life.


On a cool, crisp spring day in late April 1991, I rode the F
train to the Seventh Avenue station in Brooklyn. On the way
to the Park Slope Center for Mental Health, my voices
warned me to be fearful of two men at the far end of the car.
<i>Here's your chance to let someone else take your life for you</i>,
said the voices. <i>Those two guys want to rob you, but if you put
up a fight, they'll shoot or stab you to death</i>.


The train pulled into my station. I didn't move, waiting in
suspense to see if the men would stay or go. I remained
seated until the last second, then had to struggle to keep the
doors open so I could exit. Neither man followed. My voices

[p. <i>186</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My body <i>was</i> grotesque. I had tripled in weight from the
time I began taking prednisone for my asthma. I was breathless
all the time and could barely exercise. I was ungainly. I
no longer could bear to look at myself, to the point where I
had begun to shave without using a mirror. I shied from seeing
my reflection in shop windows. <i>Freak</i>, the voices
shouted, and I agreed with them.


Out on the street now, I dug into my shirt pocket and
took out a piece of paper that bore the name and address of
the clinic: <i>Park Slope Center, 464 Ninth Street</i>. I walked up
and down Ninth Street three times. It was a tree-lined street
with rows of well-tended private residences. I didn't see any
clinic. I was sure I'd been given the wrong address, and I
checked once more. Number four sixty-four ... The four-story
brownstone bearing this address was indistinguishable
from the other homes on the street except for a discreet brass
plaque near the door that read: PARK SLOPE CENTER FOR MENTAL
HEALTH, RITA SEIDEN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR.


I walked up a flight of steps to the entrance slowly. In all
my years in the mental health system, I had never seen a center
or clinic that looked anything like this building. The interior
confirmed my impression. There were plants everywhere.
Before me, a wood-banistered staircase led to a second
floor. To the right on the first floor was the main reception
area, with a carved ceiling, old brass chandelier, large fireplace,

[p. <i>187</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00203&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A woman seated behind a desk toward the rear of the
room greeted me. "Mr. Steele?" she inquired pleasantly.


I nodded and looked about me anxiously.


"Hello. I'm Ann," she continued. "You're a little early.
Won't you be seated?"


I settled myself carefully on an antique bench and studied
the framed photographs that filled the walls. My voices
were talking among themselves, and I sat quietly, lulled by
their sounds.


"Hello, Mr. Steele. My name is Rita Seiden."


I jumped. The speaker, a petite, pleasant-looking woman
with warm brown eyes and wavy brown hair, looked down
at me and smiled. She invited me into her office, which was
separated from the reception area by a leaded glass door. The
look and feel of the space continued and expanded on the
sense of home that had marked the reception area. There was
a Chinese screen, a soft leather couch, lots of artwork, and
several diplomas--not just hers, but her father's and grandmother's
as well. Most therapists keep their private life from
their patients. This therapist shared her family. I felt that I
entered her place as a guest, not a client.


Rita Seiden has a doctorate, but it is in sociology. In the
early eighties, following a successful career as an academic,
she decided that she wanted to be a therapist and attended
the Adelphi School of Social Work, earning a master's degree
in social work in 1983. She held a number of different jobs in
the mental health field and opened the clinic, with psychiatrist
Georges Casimir, in 1989.

[p. <i>188</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00204&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During this first and subsequent meetings with Dr. Seiden,
I talked endlessly, telling story after story. "Call me
Shannon," I began, "but I'm officially known as K. Shannon
Steele." ... "My parents died in an airplane crash when I
was young." ... "I had an affair with a neighbor when I was
fifteen and she was sixteen. We had a son, Joey. The mother
died in childbirth. Her parents didn't want the baby," I
ranted on, "so my parents raised Joey on their own." (It
never fazed me that the same parents who died young in an
airplane crash were now raising my son.) ... "I held an
important position in the office of Dianne Feinstein when she
was mayor of San Francisco," I told Dr. Seiden, "and I challenge
you to phone and check out my story." (To her credit,
Dr. Seiden never made the call.)... "My father is a big executive
in a steel firm, and my mother is very wealthy," I told
the doctor. (Again we were talking about the same parents
who had died so young and tragically in an earlier account.)


I paced the floor as I said these things, half believing
them to be true. Joey <i>was</i> my son; my mother and father <i>had</i>
died ... at least they were dead to me. And I puffed one cigarette
after another. When I smoked, Dr. Seiden asked me to
step outside her office to a small balcony, where I continued
to recount my preposterous stories.


She sat quietly, taking it all in. "That's part of what goes
on with schizophrenia," she explained to me later in our relationship.
"It's that the whole judgment is impaired, plus you
have voices hectoring you, talking about your shortcomings,
telling you that you are worthless. It's like having a constant
headset on, at the same time that there are people making
demands on you to have an ordinary life."

[p. <i>189</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00205&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Rita Seiden was one of the few therapists I met who were
truly interested in me, and I know I gave her a hard time. I
made and canceled appointments. After a few months, I ran
away from her probing questions. I liked to tell the stories <i>I</i>
chose to talk about, but I didn't want to speak about my
childhood, which is where she insisted we begin. Rita Seiden
was like a good mother; she was clearly interested in me, and
I felt myself about to succumb to her caring. The voices were
threatened. I would talk to her, and the voices would be
talking to me. <i>Leave at once!</i> The Ruler ordered.


I followed the voices.


I don't remember where they led me. I think I got a job
helping out in a small grocery story and slept in the back for
a while. I know that I spent much of the time homeless, living
in upstate New York and Pennsylvania. During this
period, I made several more stabs at ending my life. Confronting
the majesty of Niagara Falls, I decided that I had
found the perfect place to commit suicide--better than
jumping off a building or throwing myself in front of a
speeding truck. Way, way preferable to hanging from a tree.
<i>Now, now I will do it</i>, I told myself as the spray of the falls
bounced up to wet my face. But I didn't jump. Something
indefinable drew me back to people who had helped me in
the past and to places where I'd found comfort during the
long odyssey of my illness. I returned to New York City.


In the summer of 1993, physically and mentally ill, I turned
up at Fountain House. Housing coordinators Sandra Stocker
and Luis Rivera placed me in temporary quarters in a ground-floor
apartment nearby. Against my wishes, Luis took me to
Roosevelt Hospital, where I was admitted for a few days. I

[p. <i>190</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00206&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As soon as the effects of the medication wore off, I
phoned Dr. Seiden. It was clear from the tone of the receptionist
who answered the phone that my call wasn't welcome.
I looked at Alec. "I don't think the doctor will take me back
as a client," I said. "What will I do then?"


"Just try," he answered. "Things will work out."


The following day, Rita Seiden returned my call. I
explained what I was experiencing, told her about my disenchantment
with the people who had seen me at Roosevelt
Hospital, and apologized for the disruption and tumult I had
brought to her center. "I've been raised in state hospitals,
and I don't know how to behave properly in a clinic like
yours," I said, "but I'd like to try it one more time, if you'll
have me."


"Come in tomorrow and we'll see how it goes," was all she
would commit to.


Leaning on a cane and holding tight to the railing, I climbed
the stone steps to the Park Slope Center for Mental Health. In

[p. <i>191</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00207&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Seiden greeted me with similar wariness.


"I want to come back and continue the hard work we
were doing," I said. I also told her that coming back was
something I never voluntarily did. The only reason I could
give her, let alone myself, was that the "heart" of the place
that I felt from my first visit had actually been strong enough
to overcome the wishes and expressed commands of the
schizophrenic voices that had been with me since the age of
fourteen. "I'm not sure that I'll be able to resist them and
stay this time," I said. "The best I can do is promise to try.
Please, I'd like a second chance."


Dr. Seiden studied me in silence for a while. Her reply
took some time to come. "Okay, we'll see how it goes," she
finally said. "One session at a time."


I had my second chance and was determined not to
botch it.


My medical problems required immediate attention, we
both agreed, but I couldn't choose just any physician who
came recommended nor look through the classified directory
to find someone near my home. The challenge for me, as it is
for so many others like me, was to identify good doctors who
would accept Medicaid payments. Fortunately, the Health
Insurance Plan (HIP) of New York was opening its membership
to eligible Medicaid recipients, including, for a short
time, people on SSI with Medicaid. I applied, was accepted,
and soon found myself examined by a number of specialists,

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00208&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I credit other doctors, and a different medication, with
helping to restore my sanity.


Back in therapy with Rita Seiden, I told her that I was no
longer taking any antipsychotic medication. "I've been
through them all," I explained. "I'd rather live with my
voices than suffer the horrific side effects from the meds."


"I can understand your disappointment," she said. "Still,
I'd like you to see our medical director, Georges Casimir."


My first appointment with the doctor took place in
August 1994. A slim, handsome man whose speech retained
the lilt of his native Haiti, Dr. Casimir examined me, took
down my history, and heard my concerns about the various
medicines I had been given in the three decades since I'd first
been visited by the voices. Like Rita Seiden, he wasn't dismissive.
He paid careful attention to what I had to say.

[p. <i>193</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00209&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"There's something I would like you to try," Dr. Casimir
said when I'd finished speaking. "It's called Risperdal (chemical
name: risperidone). I know you distrust medicines, but
this is one of a new generation of drugs called atypical
antipsychotic medications. They're reputed to have fewer
side effects than the medicines that were prescribed in the
past. Early reports are encouraging.


"If you don't like it, you can stop taking it," he added. No
other doctor had ever given me that choice.


I agreed to try the medicine, but I took a lower dosage
than was prescribed. One of the reasons I did what Dr.
Casimir suggested, albeit in my fashion, was that he was very
clear about what he was going to do and asked for my cooperation.
Doctors don't get compliance by ordering people
around: Do this; take this. They need to have a partnership
with the patient. I wasn't forced to take the medicine, and
because I wasn't forced, I agreed to take it.


Dr. Casimir was right; there were fewer side effects. I felt
somewhat sedated, but that grew less pronounced as my system
became used to the medication. And I did, and still do,
have to deal with dryness of mouth and constipation. But I
was able to function.


During this time, I acquired a place of my very own, a
one-bedroom apartment just a few blocks from my friend
Alec's home. The thought of living without a roommate was
frightening. What if I got sick? What if the voices continued
to torment me? What if they told me to commit suicide and I
gave in to them? In therapy, Dr. Seiden and I worked through
these fears.


And so I made the move, taking along my black cat, Diva,
who came into my life when I was temporarily placed in the

[p. <i>194</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00210&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That same month, I approached Dr. Seiden with a request.
In order to remain a member in good standing at Fountain
House, I had to be involved in a structured activity, such as the
day treatment programs to which I'd been assigned. I wanted
to replace these sequential jobs with an individual project,
which would be sanctioned and supervised by Dr. Seiden. My
idea was to create and run a voter registration project for the
last disenfranchised constituency in America: the mentally ill.
As a volunteer on the Feinstein campaign so many years earlier,
I'd seen how important it was to bring out the vote. I'd
worked on phone banks, had called registered voters to make
sure they knew the location of their polling site, and had even
gone out to help voters who had difficulty in getting to the
polls. I would do that now for a cause, not a candidate.


I had prepared my argument. "No one just gave women the
vote in 1920," I told Dr. Seiden. "They had to fight for it. Similarly,
one of the early goals of the civil rights movement of the
1960s was the elimination of barriers to the voting booth. It
had been a struggle. These voting rights, and others, were not
secured until the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which suspended
state voter qualification tests. In 1971, the Twenty-sixth

[p. <i>195</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00211&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Being mentally ill and being mentally incompetent are
not the same thing," I declared. "Why, then, should we who
are mentally ill remain politically silent when there's so much
at stake that could affect the quality of our lives?"


What got me so excited about the project was that I'd
recently begun hearing new voices--in addition to the
voices of The Ruler and his legions. These new voices spoke
to me from the radio and television, as voices had done from
the time I was fourteen, but now there was an important difference.
The new voices were <i>real</i>. And riveting. They were
also extraordinarily frightening.


They spoke of abandoning disadvantaged people, including
the mentally ill--including me. They wanted to take
away all our support systems, to eliminate our meager SSI,
SSD (Social Security Disability), and Medicaid payments.
They demanded cutbacks in community mental health services,
treatment, housing, and research. They expected us, the
mentally ill, somehow to pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps.
If we failed, we could wind up homeless or in jail. It
mattered little to these political voices. They simply did not
want our care to cost them money.


I also heard the voice of Mario Cuomo, then governor of
New York, when he spoke at Fountain House in December
1993 on the occasion of his signing the Mental Hygiene Reinvestment
Act, which says that money made from the sale of
state hospital properties should be reinvested in community

[p. <i>196</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00212&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>The mentally ill don't vote</i>. I vowed to change that situation.
In November 1994, I began the Mental Health Voter
Empowerment Project, with Dr. Seiden's blessing. In New
York City, postage-paid voter registration cards are available
from the Board of Elections. Upstate, voter registration forms
do require stamps. I obtained a supply of the appropriate
cards and forms, then found my way to the shelters and
other housing where many mentally ill people live and to the
clubhouses and day treatment programs where they congregate.
In addition to the forms, I took with me a folding table,
a tablecloth printed in red, white, and blue, and some small
American flags. My efforts were educational and completely
nonpartisan. I was a traveling salesman, and what I was selling
was a key to the ballot box.


In the years since, I've been praised for the innovative
nature of this project, but what I really liked about it was
that it was comfortingly monotonous. All I had to do, once I
reached a residence or meeting place, was set up my table
and sit there--just sit there, talk to people, and help them to
register as voters. The reason such rote work was welcome is
that my delusional voices were still with me then. It's hard to
have a conversation when there are conversations going on in
your head. I had a set argument about why voting is important,
and I could make that argument again and again. When
people actually registered and made a choice about voting,

My original goal was to engage about 300 people. By
November 1996, with the help of seventy-five volunteers
whom I recruited in Manhattan and Brooklyn, close to 8,500
new voters had been registered throughout the five boroughs.
During the fall, volunteers had reached more than
7,700 of these voters, making sure they knew the location of
their polling sites and even helping many get to the polls. To
date, more than 35,000 people with serious mental illness
have registered to vote in New York City alone, most of them
for the first time in their lives. The project has gone national
and is currently under way in thirty-six states. The challenge
remains, and the work goes on.


During the months I was building the project, Dr. Seiden
noted that our therapy sessions were going better. I was pacing
less and reflecting more. She jotted this down in her
notes. In fact, my delusional voices had been receding, but
I'd been too busy to notice. Thus I was totally unprepared for
what happened next.


On May 3, 1995, sitting on my living room sofa, with
Diva resting cozily in my lap, I made a startling discovery.


My voices had stopped.
