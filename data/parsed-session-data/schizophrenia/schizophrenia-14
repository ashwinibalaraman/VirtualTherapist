BEGIN TRANSCRIPT
SYLVIA: Um, but I think I'm going to come to my senses tomorrow.
THERAPIST: Well do you know what the struggle is?
SYLVIA: I'm playing games.
THERAPIST: Meaning?
SYLVIA: Well, I'm staying within these very broad boundaries of abstinence. I'm eating totally at the high end of moderate which I figured out last week and then I started keeping secrets about desserts and eating it in private.
THERAPIST: Hi, who came online?
PHYLIS: Phylis
THERAPIST: Hi Phylis
SYLVIA: Hi Phylis
PHYLIS: Hello
THERAPIST: It's you, me and Sylvia so far.
PHYLIS: Yeah
SYLVIA: You know Josephine I should probably talk to you about that. I need to probably talk to you in private because I could talk to everybody but I don't want to hog all the time.
THERAPIST: Right. Well, why don't you hold off on it then what we were starting to talk about and I think it might be appropriate for this particular session but it probably would be better if everybody who is going to be online is online.
SYLVIA: That's what I thought.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
SYLVIA: Okay. Did you get my check in the mail?
THERAPIST: Let me see. Yes I did.
SYLVIA: Okay, good.
THERAPIST: And just a little while ago got an e-mail from Holly, I think she sent it to everybody saying that she didn't realize she had a job assignment during group time.  I also got a call from Heather saying that she didn't think she would be able to be at group.   Then I got a e-mail from Miko.  I've been working with her about six months, she had six months of abstinence; she said she broke her abstinence yesterday and said she can't believe it and she doesn't feel worthy of coming to the group and said to give her apologies and so I wrote her back an e-mail and begged her to not let the addiction win... to not let the shame stop her from coming to group.  It sounds like that she compared herself when she read the e-mails, the bios , so anyway I'm kind of concerned about her. I'm hoping that she does show up.
SYLVIA: Well I just finished six months on the 17th.   I've been keeping secrets about desserts.  I've been having dessert at lunch and dinner and I don't know what to think, I feel out of control. So, I wonder if there is something in the planet between me and Miko and I think Heather is having trouble too.
THERAPIST: I don't think Heather has broken her abstinence. It doesn't sound like you have either but it sounds like both of you are in what I call the dry drunk phase and you know dieting is just one phase of a dry drunk but when we get that attitude of what's the use and trying to play the edges it's the same thing as a dry drunk. I did talk to Susan this weekend. I'm pretty sure she's going to be able to be online today. Her mother had surgery last week and she was up helping her mom... that's why she missed last week.   
 
THERAPIST: So I'm expecting everyone else to be online. 
SYLVIA: Phylis how are you. I've been going on and on about me.
PHYLIS: I'm doing pretty well. It's interesting what you just said about the way you were feeling and things that are going on with other people.  I don't think I'm in a dry drunk phase or anything but I having a frustrating day right now. I'm very frustrated. I was kind of having a pity party for myself ten minutes ago and I was like I don't want to have to have a 4:00 phone call right now I want to go do something else but it's not that I don't look forward to it and want to talk to everyone but I think I just am like just feeling really exhausted today, very tired. 
THERAPIST: But you also have been in an unusual phase which is interviewing, interviewing and interviewing.
PHYLIS: I think it's just throwing me off too because it's just all over the place.  The addiction is being a little bit chatty these days.  I think I feel really scattered right now. I'm very emotional for some reason I don't know why but I just feel on the edge of something.  My abstinence is going well but I feel a little bit skittish if that makes sense.
THERAPIST: Sure.
PHYLIS: I'm all over the map but maybe it's just nerves because I think I'm starting to get these third and fourth interviews going on here people are wanting to hire me and as exciting as that is, I'm prolonging saying yes because I'm nervous about having a job. But I'm dealing with it because so far all I've had to do is make my meetings, focusing on my three meals a day.
THERAPIST: I think anytime we are walking into something brand new, that fear comes up but at the same time the fear comes up it does give us a chance to say okay where's God and try to walk through it with as much consciousness as possible and challenge the fear as much as we can.
PHYLIS: I'm thinking the same thing with the job... like whatever, whichever I'm supposed to have is going to come to me ... the right people and a positive environment so I'm just going try to quiet my thoughts and just focus on that right now.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm so grateful that God gave me my first few months of abstinence off but I think by the following September I went back to school and that was scary scary scary walking onto a campus as an older student you know with kids at home and all that stuff so I think we just keep walking through it and it just keeps giving us a chance to strengthen our faith muscle.
PHYLIS: Yeah, but Sylvia were you saying you were having a difficult time now or what is going on with you?
SYLVIA: I am. I don't know what my problem is but I, well I do know what it is. I need to get back on track with my nutritional choices. I think it started in the beginning of February when I said I was going to want chocolate during Valentine's day, So, I said okay don't get into the chocolate thing for dessert, but you can have coffee. And I had been trying to quit drinking coffee because I was overdoing it.  I had quit for nine months last year and then for all of January. So in February I started drinking coffee substitute in kind of like a drug way as a substitute for sugar I think and then when I started having some desserts and coffee.  I felt like I was out of control.  I thought I was going to trade the coffee for the desserts and that didn't happen.  I have a pattern of making these promises to myself that are probably like restrictions, then when I break them I feel a loss of self esteem and so I know I'm not helping myself but I can't snap out of it. You know my meals have been probably you know a six or seven on the moderate range...  the high end of moderate, maybe even eight and nine. Not every meal, lunch is usually a very reasonable salad. 
THERAPIST: And all you have is a salad?
SYLVIA: Well it's a salad with cheese and nuts and dressing and yeah that's what I have. It's all I want. I love salad. I really love salad.
THERAPIST: Okay, it may have a backlash meaning it may end up feeling like a diet.
SYLVIA: The salad's don't because even before I started this program when I was eating anything I wanted and everything I wanted, I ate salads for lunch too so I love salads. It's like my favorite thing. 
PHYLIS: Does it fill you up though? Are you satisfied after?
SYLVIA: Yes. I mean this is serious salad. It's like romaine lettuce with red cabbage, carrots, broccoli, red onions, red peppers, almonds or walnuts, cheddar cheese grated not a huge amount and probably too much dressing. Not even a low fat dressing, it's like cowgirl ranch you know. It's a very filling salad. I'm able to actually work physically eight hours with a salad as my lunch. Salad does not feel like deprivation, it feels like a reward. Almost like a treat for me.
THERAPIST: What about breakfasts?
SYLVIA: I think I'm eating on the high end of breakfast like two hard boiled eggs, a soy patty, I try to have some fruit too.
THERAPIST: Okay let me at least jump in and say why would two eggs, fruit and a soy pattie be a high moderate meal? 
SYLVIA: I'm not sure that it is but sometimes I've been having three eggs hard boiled.
PHYLIS: I'm someone who eats on the low end moderate and I think that's on the low end of moderate. 
SYLVIA: Okay, well that's my breakfast and then lunch is a salad and then dinner I have like soup and it's a reasonable soup like barley soup with brown rice and black beans or pasta. The pasta is where I think I get into the high end. Volume is where I'm thinking the problem is.  I have problems with the portions of my food because I eat dinner way at the high end of moderate... maybe that is why I'm not losing weight... but I keep thinking I can handle the meal with a dessert ...
THERAPIST: Hi, who came on?
SUSAN: Hi, it's Susan
THERAPIST: Hey Susan. Glad you're here. Susan it's just Sylvia, Susan, Phylis and me for right now and a couple of other gals we're hoping are still going to show up even though it's a quarter after but Sylvia: is being rigorously honest with us here about desserts. So she's talking about her meals and I think that both Phylis and I kind of responded by saying they sound a little bit low end and I think Sylvia you were just starting to respond by saying that you're putting desserts with those meals. The meals you described to us, right?
SYLVIA: Yeah, well with lunch and dinner lately I am. Like all weekend lunch and dinner I've had dessert.
THERAPIST: And what are the desserts you are putting with lunch and dinner?
SYLVIA: Well, I went to a store kind of like a bakery and got chocolate chip cookies and they're you know maybe three inches in diameter and about half an inch thick. They're serious cookies and I had two for lunch and two for dinner and I pretended that I wasn't eating them. It's so weird. Like I don't do it in public. I hide.  I don't eat my dessert in front of my husband. I'm pretending I'm being good. It's really sort of nuts.
THERAPIST: Well, it's certainly generically addiction.
SYLVIA: Oh yes.
THERAPIST: So it's not really nuts. It's generically addiction.  Do you think about talking to the group about it?  In other words what I'm hearing not just from Sylvia but in general from the group is that they haven't yet figured out how to use the support of the group in a way that lets them be a little bit off kilter and pull themselves back to some sanity.
SYLVIA: Right.
THERAPIST: And what they do is kind of live on their own trying to be good but then hiding when they're bad and that's so, so common addiction behavior.   We need to know this is not about being good or bad, this is about having an illness and it is about a recovery and so it is really, really important to make sure that there are no secrets going on around what you are eating. I know for a lot of people, it kicks in the dieting mentality when they are reporting what they are eating ahead of time. But you know if you make the plan, and share the plan, I can tell you it keeps us pretty much in our rigorous honesty state. 
SYLVIA: I need that. 
THERAPIST: My suggestion would be that you call in your meals for a week or two.   Just stick with the plan and keep the plan no matter what and you're going to feel very, very different, very different.
SYLVIA: Who do I call? You?
THERAPIST: You can put it in an e-mail. I prefer that you go ahead and give me a call you know leave a voice-mail for me on the regular 800 number, not the client number, but the regular 800 number.  What I did when I was new was to call in my menu plan for the first three weeks of my abstinence and even though I thought it was a stupid idea like oh yeah that's really going to work, it did. It kept me more connected to recovering energy and not enmeshed in my addiction chatter. 
SYLVIA: Would that be every day or plan it a week ahead.
THERAPIST: No, just every day.
SYLVIA: Okay.
THERAPIST: What breakfast am I eating this morning, what lunch am I eating today, what dinner am I eating this evening and I would suggest doing it for a couple of weeks. After I quit doing it, if I noticed any chatter coming up, I would commit my food for that day... right away.  Somebody would know what I am having for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I didn't ask for any feedback I just needed to be "out of the closet" about it because it is the secretiveness that kind of erodes our soul.  When we keep secrets or  we're not discussing it with somebody else in recovery, it usually can get kind of weird. Phylis you probably know it can get weird dieting chatter on the lower end of moderate and it can get weird with the higher moderate end and impulsive dessert add-ons... And the goal is the talking about it so that you are keeping a reality check and that keeps you in the belief of you have a disease, you are not the disease. You have a disease, you are not the disease. For us the difference between an addiction and say <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> is when they heard their voices, they think it's somebody else. When we hear the voice we think it's us but it's the addiction. Learning the difference between recovery chatter and addiction chatter, that's so important.   Susan, I was telling the gals that I got an e-mail from Miko who supposed to start with us today and I've been working with her individually for about six months. She had about six months of abstinence and she broke her abstinence and she said you know I don't deserve to be in the group. Tell them I'm sorry. You know she said I read one of the bios and the gal in the bio said that this is the second time working with me, that she didn't think she was ready the first time, she said maybe I'm just not ready and tell them I'm sorry. I wrote her back and said please don't let the addiction win, please come on the call.   Interestingly she didn't have to work the first few months and recently she's gone back to work. She's a teacher. We've had a hard time making our appointments and I've noticed that she's had trouble ever since our appointments weren't regular. So that's why I was so glad she was going to be able to get into the group because we've had a little harder time matching up our schedules. I just begged her to come on the call and to not let the addiction win but the addiction wants us to be shame based, it wants us to keep secrets, it wants us to isolate and it wants us to stay confused. So the best thing we can do is get out of the confusion, get out of the shame and get out of the isolation by talking, by keeping our appointments, keeping the group, e-mailing the group, leaving the messages.  Would we think they would be free of the addiction after six months?   No. So we've got to be understanding. Our addiction is as dangerous as say a heroin addiction yet ours wears the, "I'll be your best friend, nobody understands you like I do," and the mask of the little girl. "It's only a candy bar, it's only a cookie, haven't had cookies in a long time, can't I have cookies at lunch and dinner," It's our best friend addiction voice and our little girl voice that oftentimes we are the most seduced by.  Most of us want to get rid of the tormentor voice but it is those other two that we've got to be telling on, telling on those addiction voices. Actually Holly called me the other night and just happened to catch me working at the computer and she said I'm really hearing a lot of chatter... she's working on the body image issues, she's been abstinent a long time but the body image issues are really her deeper issue. I was really proud of her.  I happened to be sitting right by the phone, she just reached out, she made a call and she's got seven years of abstinence. So it isn't about judging ourselves. "You should be able to do this alone," is the addiction chatter.  You know in AA they kind of talk a lot about how now you've found you're tribe. This is your tribe. We understand you. We understand the voices. We understand wanting to be free of the voices. So to not utilize the support that you guys have available from each other is silly, it's just got to be the addiction that is keeping you from using that support. So that's it. Sylvia your situation with the desserts, what do you want to do about the desserts for today? 
SYLVIA: Want I want to do is to not eat dessert for a while.
THERAPIST: Let's just take today. 
SYLVIA: I don't want to have dessert today because it makes me feel really out of control.
THERAPIST: Then do you know what you are having for dinner?
SYLVIA: Yes. I'm having pasta.
THERAPIST: So you're having a serving of pasta. What else?
SYLVIA: Well, this is where it gets a little tricky. The assignment from last week where we're going to be writing out what we're going to do and making a menu kind of thing because I am, I share my meals with my husband and we usually cook like a spaghetti sauce that is full of vegetables and pretty much we just normally have the pasta with the sauce on it and that's dinner without like a salad or anything else.
THERAPIST: And so how much would you say a portion serving of the vegetables is coming your way at dinnertime?
SYLVIA: Okay. I would say the whole thing is about 2 1/2 ounces.
THERAPIST: No, just the vegetables.
SYLVIA: Just the vegetables. I would say over a cup.
THERAPIST: About a cup or a cup and a half. About how much pasta?
SYLVIA: A cup.
THERAPIST: And how much, any other meat in it?
SYLVIA: No. Tempe sometimes.
THERAPIST: And would you have any blood sugar problems with having no protein at the meal?
SYLVIA: Well the tempe is the protein and some cheese.
THERAPIST: I wouldn't even consider cheese as anything more than a flavoring.
SYLVIA: You're right and it is sort of a high fat way to get protein.
THERAPIST: I don't think cheese is a high enough quality protein. So are you guys vegetarian?
SYLVIA: Yes.
THERAPIST: Okay. So you know that you need to combine certain things to make it a complete protein.
SYLVIA: Right. The pasta is like whole wheat with flax and you know other stuff in it.
THERAPIST: Okay so from your vegetarian perspective is the pasta a complete protein.
SYLVIA: I would say.
THERAPIST: A flax seed and whole wheat.
SYLVIA: Okay. And also sometimes we eat noodles that are like sesame. They have other good stuff in them. And we have two or three different kinds of pasta for one serving.
THERAPIST: And so the sauce then is about another cup. 
SYLVIA: Yeah. Probably a little less or something like that.
THERAPIST: Sauce with the tempe would end up being like another cup so that's about three cups of food, right.
SYLVIA: I would say that's true.
THERAPIST: All right so that's the plan for this evening. Now in general I want you to hear what both Phylis and I said was that the breakfasts seem a little low. When we are doing a little low, it's not surprising that we are adding on. So I want you to consider adding some rice sesame crackers to your lunch.
SYLVIA: I'm out of control with those. I can't just eat one.
PHYLIS: Yeah, I'm the same with crackers. 
SYLVIA: I actually can't have, I can't eat crackers or bread. 
PHYLIS: Yeah, me too. I don't have any of that in the house but
THERAPIST: Here's the thing you guys. When you ban something, usually the addiction likes that because then it has an open door for deprivation or impulsiveness. So rather than just say I can't have it, say it's in my future... but I don't think I want it right now. It's in my future.
SYLVIA: Right. I look it at that way. If I can go out to eat and they serve bread, I might have a piece of bread and I'm probably going to put butter on it. I not having bread in the house because I can't, it's a completely out of control thing for me. Like some people can't eat one of those rice crackers.
THERAPIST: Again, I want to help you frame it differently.  Because what you are saying is, if I pick up anything that triggers me, I can't maintain my abstinence. I got to tell you that doesn't have to happen. Even if you end up bringing something in to the house that sets up the disease chatter of, "let's have it again, let's have it again," you can get rid of it... you don't have to say, "oh well, I'm out of control," and then eat it. That's the part I want you guys to really hear. When you say I'm out of control, you're saying the addiction is going to make all the decisions and I want you to hear that doesn't have to be true.  Your words can say, "I don't think that works for me, I'd like to not have them in the house," which is very different than saying I'm out of control when I do that. Okay.
SYLVIA: Right. Okay that's good.
THERAPIST: It's a subtle point but it's you saying that you don't have any hope for recovery.
SYLVIA: I think in the future I could eat rice crackers. They're in my future.
THERAPIST: Well, I think since you've eaten two cookies at each meal, and now you're saying, "that's not working for me, I don't like the consequences of that."  You don't have to say, "I'm out of control."   You can say, "I don't like that, I want to change that." That's really going to keep you more in your core of yourself, the spirit of yourself.
SYLVIA: Okay, that's good.
THERAPIST: Does that make sense to you guys. It's okay to say I don't have it in the house right now. That's okay. But I think when we start to think, "if I'm triggered I'm lost," that is not a safe thing to say. If you hear the chatter, you make a decision to do it different.
PARTICIPANT: I think that's smart, yeah.
THERAPIST: Phylis does that make sense?
PHYLIS: Yes, but for myself, certain foods that are a problem, they can make me feel a certain way so that it's almost like I feel like I've "blown it" or I feel fuller than I think I should. There are certain mind games for certain things it's not that I'm not ever going to have them again but I just don't include them right now.  Pasta is one of them because even with a very small portion of pasta I feel very full. It just blows up in my stomach and I just feel really full and it creates a lot of chatter for me. 
THERAPIST: Let me ask you one quick question. Is the pasta that she described the pasta that you're saying causes you that problem or is it kind of the regular pasta you get in a grocery store?
PHYLIS: The whole wheat   Also, if I have a dessert, I kind of look at the meal beforehand because normally there's something that has gone on there that's made me feel like I deserve a cookie.   Normally there's something leading up to the fact that I'm adding it. Like a breakfast that's too small, you know. It's like you've eaten too small a breakfast and then around five or six o'clock and you're having dinner and in your head somewhere it's like, "well I didn't eat enough at breakfast so I'll just eat the cookie now and pretend it's at breakfast or something like that you know. 
THERAPIST: A lot of people don't have that much thought. It's just I want it I add it. That's the part that when we make a plan at the beginning of the day and if we keep our word, we don't feel out of control. We feel self respecting and glad that we kept our word and I believe, Sylvia, that's more of what you're really reeling from, is your not keeping your word to you. You're acting impulsive at meal time with dessert.
SYLVIA: Yeah. The first few months I wasn't having dessert and I felt better and I felt stronger around my abstinence.
THERAPIST: Then you don't ever have to slip into that again if there's no secrets you know and I think that the addiction wants us to keep secrets so if you can put a sign up on your mirror that says no secrets about my abstinence, no secrets about my food choices, then we have a chance to keep our word. I want to comment on Phylis. Your comment about the pasta; once I was over 50, pasta just seemed to welling up in my stomach in general, I don't do pasta anymore but it doesn't have anything to do with me being afraid or being triggered, it's just Phylis what you said, it doesn't feel good in my stomach. So, yesterday I made marinara sauce with chicken sausage and then cut up steamed green beans and the green beans was in place of the pasta. 
PARTICIPANT: Yeah, I do that too. I do that with spaghetti squash actually.
THERAPIST: Yeah, spaghetti squash, asparagus, any kind and Sylvia you already got your vegetables in there.
SYLVIA: Right. So I could have more steamed veggies and then put them in and have less pasta. Susan I don't think was here last week when we were talking about half a cup of pasta. Was it half a cup of pasta?
THERAPIST: Yeah, uh uh. Half a cup is for a complex carb, half a cup is a moderate serving.  And for a simple carb, a cup is a moderate serving.  So when you think about a complex carb, that would be usually our grains, legumes and winter vegetables I think they're called. You know potatoes, sweet potatoes, the winter squashes, yeah, and peas and corn, those are all complex carbs and so an appropriate serving of a complex carb would be half a cup and a simple carb would be a cup just as a general rule of thumb. That's a general rule of thumb. Whoever shared it last time, I don't remember which gal in the group, do you guys remember who it was?
PARTICIPANT: I think it was Heather.
THERAPIST: Heather. She has seen like a Discovery Channel program, and a nutritionist had commented that she has gone into restaurants to check out portion sizes and in her research, restaurants typically serving you six times the moderate serving and that's also for children's meals. You always see macaroni and cheese on a children's menu, that's for children's servings and adults. Six times as much. That's a pretty big statement. So if when we think in terms of looking at what's moderate, look at what's a moderate serving of what. With desserts, a good measurement is four to nine bites and that's pretty much what a complex carb would be. 
PARTICIPANT: Four to nine bites.
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
PARTICIPANT: Now can I just say that I have totally done like a really weird thing with that where I haven't done this lately but in the past where I ate a cookie in three bites. It was probably like 12 bites for somebody else but I did it to pretend that I was having only three bites for dessert.
THERAPIST: Yeah, and that is where rigorous honesty has to come in. You're either protecting your abstinence or your protecting your addiction. It really has got to be up to us... which one we're protecting.  And yes, it takes a little while to drop into the rigorous honesty so the fact that you even told us is great. 
PARTICIPANT: I'm embarrassed, but you know there's another part of me that's like there's nothing to lose, so I want to be honest. 
THERAPIST: There you go. You don't want to keep living the old way.
PARTICIPANT: It's nothing we all haven't done.
PARTICIPANT: Yeah, I know. Phylis I think you're on the other end, right the low end. 
PHYLIS: No, well yeah I mean I've done that.  It's happened a couple of times, where I've grazed my way through the meal, but I think that being on the low end is just as bad as being on the high end because I am setting myself up. 
THERAPIST: Well let me comment Phylis because the grazing through a meal is having an impulsive meal and it doesn't matter if it stays small or stays large, if it's impulsive, we end up giving up part of our serenity and self respect. We haven't made a plan and kept our word and so anybody would feel off with that whether you end up at the low end or the high end. I think I've told you guys this story. I had a client that is kosher and the Friday night hollah bread, it's like an egg bread I think, hollah bread, and she said she would plan her piece of hollah in with her Shabbat dinner and then she would add on another piece and then another piece and so that would push her right up to the high end of moderate.   So I said for the next month I want you to plan three pieces of hollah bread every Friday night. You don't have to eat all three, you can eat one, you can eat two or you can eat three, but you have to have a plan of three.  And when she had the plan of three, there was no impulsiveness and she typically didn't eat all three. When one was planned and she broke her word to herself, she paid an emotional price.  But when she planned three and only ended up eating one or two, she kept the plan and kept her word, and her whole energy was different and that's the part I want you guys to really really hear. The plan, the plan, the plan.  Keep your word, keep your word, keep your word. You don't like the plan change the plan for next time, but you don't change the plan impulsively.  So, I think what I'm hearing Sylvia again from you is, I don't like the fact that I'm impulsive at meals and I'm impulsive with desserts. So make a plan. 
A lot of people in early abstinence say, "it's in my future, it's in my future, just not right now, not right now," which is fine. 
SYLVIA: I think I remember Heather a while ago did a thing where she said she wouldn't have dessert unless she planned it 24 hours ahead and I think she was doing no white sugar.  White sugar and white flour are in my future but for right now I feel very triggered when I'm even thinking about you know Girl Scout cookies or whatever.  My husband came home with stocks of them. 
THERAPIST: Does he understand that you're working on this eating addiction recovery? 
SYLVIA: Uh, no, he doesn't understand.
THERAPIST: No, does he know? He may not understand but does he know you are dealing with an eating addiction.
SYLVIA: No, not exactly.
THERAPIST: Okay then I want you to think about and maybe talk to your therapist. I know her and I want you to talk to her about why you're not willing to say to a husband that I am recovering from an eating addiction.
SYLVIA: Well he has a lot of judgment around me being out of control for so long.
PARTICIPANT: When you say judgment, do you mean like he's resentful?
SYLVIA: No, but he well let's just say he's a wonderful person and he's fantastic in many many ways but he does not completely agree, like my sister got sober through AA and he sort of he has judgments around that... you know it's for weak people or something and so I just really have never told him.
THERAPIST: But I want to hear if that's his reality, and you pretend that you can adopt his reality, the addiction will beat you into the ground. But, if you say, "I'm sure sweetie that you don't totally get it and I know that you don't really get it or understand or agree that my sister is finding strength by going to AA, but everything I've read tells me something different and so I am addressing my eating problem as an eating addiction and I just don't want to have that a secret between us. I know, you don't have to agree at all but I don't want to pretend that's not my truth"   Some version of that.
SYLVIA: Well I think something Phylis just said made me realize something.  Over the years I've tried Weight Watchers and he's been aware of that and I've lost a bunch of weight and then I've gained it all back. I've tried other programs and I've tried getting hypnotized and acupuncture and all these things to lose weight.   I think that for him to witness me over the years having all these things not working long term is hard.  So for me, I am not interested in telling him I'm doing this until I know that it really works... I'm just being secretive and trying to protect it.
THERAPIST: Well, nothing wrong with that but if he has some issue around your overeating what the hell is he doing bringing in boxes of cookies.
SYLVIA: Okay, so we're talking about sneakiness and everything, I don't eat the cookies that he brings in.
THERAPIST: Yeah, but I want to know if he has the issue about thinking you are just weak willed, why is he bringing in big volumes of cookies?
SYLVIA: Well, because only he eats them. I don't eat those.
THERAPIST: Is that always true, right this moment, right this year.
SYLVIA: In general that's true. Like I told you I'm secretive about my cookies. 
THERAPIST: Let me tell you one of the most common dynamics in couples when one has an addiction and one doesn't, the one that doesn't, without knowing they are doing it, oftentimes unconsciously tries to show the other one how to eat, how to eat in control, how to diet, how to control, how to do it right, how to pick right, they do this rigidity part in counterbalance to our out of control.
SYLVIA: That's absolutely true. 
THERAPIST: Does he do that?
SYLVIA: Yes. 
THERAPIST: Okay. If you end up with both people with an addiction oftentimes they support the addiction in each other... often they seduce us back into the addiction because they don't want to lose their addiction buddy but very often when they don't have an addiction, they are always always showing you how to control and so that's why I want to know, is he bringing them in to show you how to control, how long he can make them last, how he can only do two of them at a meal and he doesn't have any problem, anyway, the addiction often dominates relationships. That's for sure whether or not we know it.
SYLVIA: Yeah, yeah, you're on to something. I don't think it's conscious. 
THERAPIST: I don't think it's conscious. No. Sometimes it's conscious, but very rarely. So at any rate, that's why I want to know why the cookies are coming in because I suspect some counterbalance dynamic going on. So you don't have to tell him right now, but I think if you don't tell him soon, if you were trying to get sober without telling your husband you're going to AA, the chances of you staying sober in AA would be pretty slim, but if you said, "I know you don't understand, I know you don't agree, I need to do this for me, I hope I have your love and support even if you don't agree." To me that would be a better approach for long term sobriety so I'm trying to give you the same kind of take on your abstinence. I think for long term abstinence being out of the closet with your husband in a loving way is the best way to go.
SYLVIA: You're right. Now I feel guilty that I've dominated this conversation. 
PARTICIPANT: Oh no, oh no.
PARTICIPANT: Is Phylis still here?
HEATHER: It's Heather.
THERAPIST: Hey Heather.
PARTICIPANT: Hey Heather.
HEATHER: Sorry I'm late.
THERAPIST: Glad you're with us. We have had a great great session and I think it was all the issues you wanted to talk about so.
HEATHER: I know I have been trying to get on the phone for the like 20 minutes.
THERAPIST: You're kidding.
HEATHER: I'm sorry. I've been having problems. I actually tried to get on
THERAPIST: Good for you, good for you. So did Phylis get knocked off? Phylis are you there? It sounded like somebody got knocked off right before Heather came on. So was the service telling you you couldn't get on the conference line?
HEATHER: My problems were having to do with my own cell phone so it wasn't anything with the service. I'm sorry I missed it all. I'll have to touch base with someone and find out what I missed. 
THERAPIST: Yeah, Sylvia, and Susan you too, maybe try to put into words what we talked about because it's so critical. This is a phase in our development that is so so critical because we're at the part where in the Dieting: A Dry Drunk Workbook, we're finishing the end of part two. Oftentimes when we get to the end of part two, the 20th chapter is the end of part two, I go back to part one because we really need to redefine that balance, that bottom foundation over and over and over.
PARTICIPANT: Did you say go back and read part one?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I go back and start with the homework assignments in part one again.
PARTICIPANT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Hi who's came on?
PHYLIS: It's Phylis. Sorry.
THERAPIST: While you got bumped off Phylis, Heather came online. I was suggesting to the three of us, the four of us I guess it was Sylvia, Susan, Phylis and Heather for you guys to put into words what you got out of this session because a brief recap for the other gals in the group that weren't able to make the call and I think Sylvia that would really be a helpful reinforcement of you getting your foundation really really solid again. You've had it solid before, you know you want it solid again, Heather that's kind of your issue and the thing that I tried to point out is, the most critical element is make a plan, no impulsiveness, and keep your word.  Make decisions from your God self... choose from that instead of making them from the addiction energy. So make a plan, keep your plan, if you don't like the plan, change the plan the next day but keep the plan for today, keep your word. It's keeping your word that will make you feel like you are standing on solid ground again. Does that make sense?  Heather, I told the story about the client I had that was kosher and on Friday night with Shabbat they have hollah bread and so she would plan in one piece of hollah bread and then add two more on impulsively and feel awful and I said for the next month I want you to plan in three pieces of hollah bread every Friday night. You don't have to eat all three but the plan is for three. You can eat one, you can two or you can eat three. There's no impulsiveness because you have three pieces planned and it changed the energy. There must be a plan and keeping your word. Then you feel like you're the one that's making the decisions. I think both Phylis and Sylvia were kind of using more words like "triggered" and "out of control" and the addiction loves that because then it knows it's got the upper hand and I always encourage people to say I heard the chatter, I don't like the chatter, I need to make a different choice.  So if I bring foods into the house or eat foods that create a "let's have it again" chatter, then I don't bring that food home. Why would I plan that in you know. Then Phylis mentioned sometimes she doesn't plan things in that sometimes make her feel bloated. It's like, right on. So, try to paraphrase a lot of the ideas that we talked about share with the missing gals.  Heather did you want to check in at all a little bit.
HEATHER: I guess am not, I'm not keeping my word to myself and it's just really been hard and every day I've added something sweet and I'm just in the cycle right now.
THERAPIST: That's exactly the Sylvia cycle.
HEATHER: Oh, you're in the same thing Sylvia.
SYLVIA: Yeah, I just finished six months of abstinence and I think I'm still abstinent but I've been keeping secrets.
HEATHER: Oh wow you and I are just totally parallel.
SYLVIA: I'm hiding it and not eating in front of people.
HEATHER: Oh, me too. Old behaviors and actually to tell you the truth I'm having old behaviors in other parts of my life. I had the worst road rage issue come up yesterday with this other driver and I had my two year old in the car with me and I'm like who is this person?  I'm just needing to regroup in general right now.
THERAPIST: Heather, do you know who that person is? That's the person who feels the remorse and regrets of not keeping her word. If you keep your word, then you have a choice to change the plan. 
SYLVIA: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay so I suggest both you get out of the secretiveness by making sure that you're leaving me a message about what the plan is for the day and then you check in with me at the end of the day when you go to bed that you've kept your word.   If you bookend your day by checking in with someone else, it will keep you more connected to your spirit, your God part, you will be keeping your word.  I know that just because Susan didn't identify with that pattern or Phylis didn't identify with that pattern exactly, it's still universal for us...  that we if we have impulsiveness at mealtime, we've given away our self respect and our serenity. If you wait until right before the meal and impulsively put the meal together, it won't feel great either. It'll probably feel better than breaking your word, but it won't feel great to impulsively plan the meal five minutes before you sit down to eat. So Heather I want to mention that Miko was supposed to start with us today and 
HEATHER: Oh and she didn't.
THERAPIST: She didn't. She sent me an e-mail. I've been working with her about six months and that she just recently gone back to work in February. So she's been working about a month and so we have had a harder time making our individual appointments and it sounded like she broke her abstinence after reading the bios and kind of comparing herself negatively and I think actually Heather yours was the one that said you worked with me years before and that you might not have been ready and her addiction grabbed on to that and said, "I think I'm like that gal, that I'm not really ready, I didn't do it, I didn't do it right, tell them I'm sorry." I can't believe it... she just cried when I told her there was finally an opening in the group for her to come in, so keep her in your e-mail list, send her an e-mail saying Josephine said you had a relapse, don't let that stop you from being part of our group. I really want to encourage you guys to reach out to her cause it really scares me that the shame is stopping her from joining us.
PARTICIPANT: This is just so damn hard.
THERAPIST: Yeah. The shame of it is so so overwhelming and the addiction just uses the shame to keep us isolated and to have us keep secrets. 
PARTICIPANT: It is, it's just awful, awful.
PARTICIPANT: Thank you Josephine for answering the phone when I called you today It was meant to be that I can get out of my addiction and get back into recovery.
THERAPIST: The way I would phrase it is, you Sylvia and Heather, you guys are in a little bit of a dry drunk and what created the dry drunk is the impulsiveness and no plan. So what you want to do is make a plan that's not a diet meal, but an average meal. You want to create daily menu plans and if it's a troublesome food right now, it's in your future, not in your plan.  Just say, "I'll make sure I talk to Josephine before I plan it in." Don't let the only way you're going to get the cookie is, by impulsively putting it in. No, it gets planned in and Josephine knows that it's getting planned in and it's not planned in and when you're alone... it's planned in in public. That makes it feel like it's got a plan for you guys to not feel so off.   I know that Susan last week you told me that your mom had surgery and you were helping her out... so do you want to take the last minute or two and go ahead and check in a little bit too?
SUSAN: Yeah, you know I'm struggling too although I feel I have been struggling with surrender but I had a session with Josephine a few days ago and had committed to starting planning again and I have yesterday and today. I'm feeling good about it and you know it's so true when you do plan out a meal, there's a lot of peace around it. You know and I've tried every way to manipulate it. but I'm just kind of putting my nose to the grindstone and walking forward from here because you know I don't know that I feel great but I'm happy that I'm keeping my word to myself at this point.
THERAPIST: It makes such a difference, such a difference.
SUSAN: That it does. 
THERAPIST: The plan, the plan, the plan. You don't like the plan, change the plan tomorrow, don't change the plan today because the addiction will not like the plan and you'll think, you might think it's you but just keep your word and tomorrow you can make another plan in the morning. With that said, it's time for us to wrap up but Sylvia you're going to stay on for a minute and I'll put an appointment on the books and Heather can you stay on, I'll have you both stay on the line for a minute while I get your appointments on the books.
