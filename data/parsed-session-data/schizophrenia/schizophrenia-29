Because of the rapid growth in population of people from
different ethnic and cultural backgrounds in the United
States, clinicians are often faced with the daunting challenge
of providing responsive services that are culturally sensitive
(i.e., a sensitive and respectful response with knowledge about
the culture and values of a particular group). A difficult issue is
the clinician's ability to accurately distinguish between child
maltreatment and culturally based parenting practices (i.e., practices
acceptable or normative to one's cultural group). This
chapter provides a pragmatic decision-making model to help
differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate parenting
practices.


<u>Scenario 1</u>


Mr. and Mrs. Nguyen, recent Vietnamese immigrants, were
referred by the local school district after the school nurse
discovered that Lan Nguyen, a 7-year-old student, had bruises
on her back. They were referred to the local medical center.



[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<u>Scenario 2</u>


Mr. and Mrs. Diaz, Guatemalan immigrants who have resided
in the United States for the past 15 years, were reported to
child protective services by their next-door neighbor for
publicly disciplining their 6-year-old daughter with a flyswatter
to the buttocks. A medical examination did not reveal any
physical evidence. What is the most appropriate response?


? <i>Reporting Versus Response</i>


Before examining the issue of culturally based parenting practices,
it is important to distinguish between reporting child
maltreatment and providing a clinical response. In the first
instance, all children, regardless of sex, race, ethnicity, or religious
beliefs, should have the opportunity to be raised in an
environment free of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and
neglect. Furthermore, although state statutes governing child
abuse reporting vary, it is the ethical and legal responsibility of
all clinicians to report all instances of suspected child maltreatment.
We know of no parenting practice that would supersede a
clinician's legal and ethical obligation to ensure the safety of a
child. Therefore, it is essential that all clinicians respond by
reporting suspected child endangerment, regardless of the ethnic
or cultural background of the family.


? <i>Current or Future Risk of Harm</i>


Issues of cultural diversity, however, may play a very important
role in how clinicians respond to families of different cultural
backgrounds. Although the clinician's obligation is clear (typically
to report suspected child maltreatment), parents have broad
discretion in the manner in which they interact with and discipline
(i.e., parent) their children. Irrespective of culturally based
parenting practices, it is important to assess whether the child is
at risk for current and future harm (sexual and physical harm or

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Acculturation and Treatment</i>


In addition, acculturation should be taken into consideration
when determining a probable course of action. People with a low
level of acculturation should be offered psychoeducational services
(e.g., teaching or informing parents about acceptable parenting
practices and alternative methods of discipline). Due to
their limited knowledge of American parenting practices, this
approach provides less acculturated parents with alternative and
effective methods of discipline that are acceptable and lawful.
People who are well acculturated (who understand that it is
against the law to harm their child) should be provided a therapeutic
response (i.e., psychotherapy)--for example, a parent-child
treatment program that focuses on improving the quality
of the relationship and addresses the parent personality or behavioral
characteristics that placed the child at jeopardy.


In conclusion, multidisciplinary caseworkers need to be cognizant
of the multitude of parenting practices across cultures.
Regardless of what parenting practices are acceptable to particular
cultures, it is imperative to assess for current or future risk of
harm to the child. In sum, we offer a six-step decision making
model to guide clinicians' judgment in differentiating child maltreatment
from cultural parenting practices.


? <i>A Six-Step Model</i>


The following is a six-step decision-making model for accurately
distinguishing child maltreatment from culturally based discipline
strategies:

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

1. Is the child at risk for physical, sexual, or emotional harm
or neglect or both, or is there actual harm?


2. If "yes," it is the clinician's legal (given the state statute
governing child abuse reporting) and ethical responsibility
to report suspected maltreatment or harm. It is important
to note that no type of cultural parenting practice should
supersede the clinician's obligation to report child maltreatment.
The cultural background of the family, however, may
be essential in determining the most appropriate intervention
strategy.


3. If the child is not at risk for physical, sexual, or emotional
harm or neglect or both, assess the family's level of acculturation
(e.g., language use, duration of time in the United
States, ethnicity of friends, and involvement in religious and
cultural traditions).


4. An assessment of the family's level of acculturation will
determine whether a psychoeducational or therapeutic response
is most appropriate.


5. If clients have minimal knowledge of acceptable U.S. law
sand acceptable child-rearing practices, a psychoeducational
approach is recommended. Parent persistence in harmful
parenting practices after completion of a psychoeducational
intervention may warrant assessment for a therapeutic intervention.


6. If clients have an acceptable knowledge level of U.S. laws
and practices, a therapeutic approach is recommended.

Child abuse and neglect is a crime in all 50 states and
territories. Therefore, the responsibility to protect children
from child maltreatment is shared by the child
protection system (including the civil court systems) and the
criminal justice system (including law enforcement, prosecutors,
and the criminal courts). Generally, by law or practice or both,
law enforcement agencies' interest is reserved for child homicides,
sexual abuse, serious physical abuse, and other more
egregious incidents of child maltreatment for which public expectations
of accountability are aroused.


Child protection and law enforcement approach child maltreatment
issues with significantly different missions and philosophies.
Child protection is focused on reducing the risk to the child
of future maltreatment and on trying to maintain and strengthen
as much of the child's family as possible. Law enforcement is
focused on holding those who break the law accountable for their
actions--in effect, punishment. These two apparently contradictory
roles may collide when serious child abuse is reported. In
many communities, this potential conflict is managed only
through avoidance. The child protection and law enforcement

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To reduce the secondary trauma of the investigative process
and to improve the effectiveness of all agencies involved, a coordinated
or team approach such as a child advocacy center is
needed. Such collaboration requires planning and hard work, but
it can pay off in improved services for the child and family, less
trauma for the child, more accurate information on which all can
act, mutual support for the investigators, and more efficient use
of scarce resources.


? <i>Establishing Systems Protocols
and Operational Agreements</i>


The first step in formal coordination is the establishment of
working agreements or protocols. This step is usually initiated by
management of the agencies involved (child protective services
[CPS], local law enforcement, prosecutors, or sometimes outside
advocates). One of the biggest perceived challenges is agency
information confidentiality and record keeping. Agencies must
resolve questions of
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• who has access to what information,
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• how information obtained from another investigative
agency is preserved in the record, and
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• how the differing discovery processes in juvenile or family
court and those in criminal court will be managed.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


• who has access to what information,


• how information obtained from another investigative
agency is preserved in the record, and


• how the differing discovery processes in juvenile or family
court and those in criminal court will be managed.

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The community agencies must determine the structure of
collaboration, including the roles that representatives from each
agency will play in the process, from talking initial information
to investigation and evidence collection and case decisions about
child protection and prosecution. Coordinated investigations are
best managed through cooperation and trust, which are facilitated
by regular meetings or case reviews in which all parties share
critical case information. A decision as to which agency will lead
such meetings should be made at the inception. Joint and cross-training
also reduce the risk of misunderstandings regarding
pertinent policies and procedures and enhance investigative
skills. Conflict in such collaboration is normal and can, in fact,
be healthy as long as the agencies have a strategy for solving
problems and resolving conflict.


? <i>Establishing Joint and Team
Investigative Protocol</i>


The actual protocol should, at a minimum, include the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• <i>Receiving reports:</i> Who will the public contact when they
suspect child abuse? What information do all investigative
agencies need from the reporter at the time of referral?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• <i>Notification of other parties:</i> Once the report is received,
the agencies need to agree on the nature and timing of
notification. What type of cases require immediate notification
of the other agencies (i.e., in what circumstances
does CPS call law enforcement as the intake worker is
being notified)? In general, immediate notification of law
enforcement is indicated in child death cases, serious
abuse cases in which there is immediate danger to the
child or other children, cases in which fresh physical
evidence may be present (pornography, computer records
of sexual acts, weapons, objects used as sexual devices,
bloody clothing or furnishings, etc.), or when access to
the child or flight by the abuser is in question.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• <i>Creating a common investigative protocol:</i> Agencies need
to agree on the usual course of the investigative process.
</p><p>[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
This includes the steps CPS and law enforcement will take
to determine what, if anything, happened to the child and
in what order these steps (e.g., interviewing the child,
other witnesses, nonoffending parents, and suspects; assessment
of medical evidence, crime scene evidence, and
psychological information; and collection of other evidence)
will be performed. Such protocols serve as a
framework for the investigation and lay out expectations
of all involved, but they can easily be modified by the
participants as needed based on the unique aspects of
individual cases.

• <i>Team decision making:</i> Agencies need to determine how
decision making concerning child safety and protection
will be made.


These systems responses must be augmented by the efforts of
individual protective service workers. Individuals must reach out
to their colleagues in law enforcement and prosecution and build
social relationships, personal familiarity, and trust, share professional
information from the literature and training, and help the
relationship move from one between agencies to one of trust
between individuals.

Harmful involvement with alcohol and drugs is a factor in
as many as 80% of situations involving child maltreatment
or neglect. In such cases, child protection depends
on the professional's ability to recognize, assess, and intervene
with an often resistant caregiver.


? <i>Obstacles to Identification</i>


Screening for substance-related problems is hampered by the
omnipresent denial associated with addiction. By definition, the
addict or alcoholic is unable to accurately self-assess either the
extent of his or her impairment or the severity of its impact on
others, including the child.


To complicate matters, the caregiver is often keenly aware of
the possible legal or social sanctions that may accompany an
admission of drug or alcohol problems. This may motivate
outright attempts to deceive or mislead the professional, resulting

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• Substance-induced impaired thinking and organic brain
effects


• "Blackouts" or other memory loss


• Panic or extreme anxiety associated with drug withdrawal


• Psychological defenses such as rationalizing, externalizing,
and minimizing drug use and associated problems


• Misconceptions about the nature and symptoms of addiction


• Codependency and enabling by family and friends


Given these obstacles, it is apparent that specialized training is
necessary to prepare for effective assessment and intervention in
child maltreatment cases.


? <i>Abuse Versus Dependence</i>


Substance <i>abuse</i> disorders generally reflect alcohol or drug consumption
that creates significant problems in one or more major
areas of functioning. Symptoms may include job, family, legal,
and relationship problems. Substance <i>dependence</i>, however, refers
to a pattern of chronic, usually progressive dysfunction
characterized by
<table>

and type
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Loss of control over the amount used, time or place where
use occurs, or duration of episode

</table>


• The presence of withdrawal symptoms of varying intensity
and type


• Loss of control over the amount used, time or place where
use occurs, or duration of episode


• Continued use despite adverse life consequences


Obviously, abuse and dependence can and do coexist in the same
individual. Symptoms vary with drug of preference. Cocaine
users, for example, may experience more financial and psychological
disruption than alcoholics, who in turn are prone to a
variety of medical and health complications not found among
marijuana users.

? <i>Screening and Assessment</i>


No specific, widely accepted screening tool exists to meet the
unique challenge of assessing drug or alcohol use among caregivers
in a situation involving child maltreatment. More generic
instruments used by addiction treatment clinicians include the
following:

? <i>Conducting the Interview</i>


The following are important to assess:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Is there a family history of alcoholism or drug abuse?
Addiction clearly runs in families. Even someone in deep
denial is often willing to discuss a parent's or grandparent's
history of alcohol and drug problems. In doing so, the
caregiver reveals an important risk factor in his or her own
situation.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Are there alcohol- and drug-related social consequences?
These may include problems that are caused by intoxication,
withdrawal, drug-seeking behavior, or all three. These problems
may not have provided enough motivation for the
addict to seek help.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Is there an identified withdrawal syndrome? This may include
insomnia, sweats, nausea, tremors, seizures, vomiting,
and extreme anxiety. Often, the addict blames these symptoms

Despite the obstacles to uncovering drug or alcohol problems
in a caregiver, many clinicians have developed, with practice, a
remarkably accurate "ear" for the telltale signs of abuse and
dependence--a skill that can mean the difference between child
protection and child endangerment.

Concerns about dangerousness of caregivers to themselves
or their children are common in child protection work.
Caretakers who are depressed, hopeless, or enraged or
threatening may pose increased risks to themselves and others.
To further screen caregivers' dangerousness, a worker must
gather information about their past and current behavior,
thoughts, and plans. From these facts and observations, the
worker can apply common sense, knowledge of risk factors,
standardized risk assessment methods, and consultation with
peers and supervisors to determine whether the caregivers present
a serious enough risk to themselves or their child to require
emergency intervention.


? <i>Suicidality</i>


When screening for suicidality, worker must directly ask about
suicidal thoughts and plans. If suicidal plans are present, emergency
assessment by a mental health professional is needed. Until
the assessment for suicidality is completed, appropriate precautions
include having family members prevent access to guns and

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When assessing the suicidality of a caregiver, it is important
to explore the caregiver's thoughts and plans about the children
in his or her care. Suicidal caregivers sometimes think that killing
their children before committing suicide will rescue the children
from circumstances they view as intolerable.


In addition to talking with the caregiver, who may or may not
reveal dangerous past behavior, thoughts, or plans, it is important
to interview others who have interacted closely with the caregiver,
including children, spouses, neighbors, close friends, and
relatives. Talking to other informants allows the worker to estimate
the reliability of information obtained directly from the
caregiver. Different sources usually offer slightly differing perspectives,
but major discrepancies suggest that someone is mistaken
or lying. Thoughts and plans are difficult to assess without
a cooperative and truthful informant, but caregivers who choose
to understate the seriousness of their thoughts and plans to a child
protection worker may have shared their real thoughts and
feeling with others close to them.


Signs of impending suicide include a lack of future plans or
hopes, disposing of prized possessions, writing a will, making
alternative care arrangements for children, and attempts to secure
the means for committing suicide (e.g., buying a gun or rope).
Past suicide attempts, or relatives and loved ones who have
committed suicide, increase the individual's risk of suicide. Other
factors that increase the risk of suicide include being adolescent,
a young adult, or older than age 45; alcohol dependence; persistent
rage or history of violence; male gender; unwillingness to
accept help; depression; prior psychiatric hospitalization; recent
loss or separation; loss of physical health; unemployment; and
single, widowed, or divorced marital status.


Although some advise contracting with suicidal persons to
deter them from attempting to kill themselves, it is unclear how
much confidence should be placed in antisuicide contracts. Suicidal
persons develop "tunnel vision" in which suicide seems to

? <i>Screening Questions for Risk of Suicide</i>


The following questions, which focus on some of the strongest
risk factors identified by research on suicide, are drawn primarily
from the Columbia Teen Screen, which has demonstrated usefulness
in screening high school students for risk of suicide:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Have you been losing your temper, been in a bad mood,
or have little things been making you upset?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Have you been feeling unhappy or sad?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Have you thought about suicide?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• If yes, do you have a plan? If yes, what is it?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Have you ever tried to commit suicide?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Has any close friend or relative of yours ever committed
suicide?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Have you been having a problem with drugs or alcohol?
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


• Have you been losing your temper, been in a bad mood,
or have little things been making you upset?


• Have you been feeling unhappy or sad?


• Have you thought about suicide?


• If yes, do you have a plan? If yes, what is it?


• Have you ever tried to commit suicide?


• Has any close friend or relative of yours ever committed
suicide?


• Have you been having a problem with drugs or alcohol?


If an individual has suicidal thoughts and a plan for how to kill
him- or herself, the more developed and lethal the plan, the
greater the risk of suicide.


? <i>Danger to Children and Others</i>


Estimating dangerousness is a challenging but necessary task for
child protection workers. It is very important to remember that
past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. Past incidents
of assault on spouses, children, and pets are important risk
factors for future assaultiveness. Some child protection agencies
use standard risk assessment forms, but the ultimate judgment of
dangerousness relies on careful consideration of the facts and

about predicting dangerousness.

The following factors increase the potential for violence: age
in the late teens or early 20s; male gender; low socioeconomic
status; low intelligence; limited education; unemployment; residential
instability; impulsivity; low frustration tolerance; frequent
and open threats; access to weapons; chronic anger, hostility,
or resentment; enjoyment of inflicting pain; lack of
compassion; self-view as victim; childhood victimization or deprivation;
early loss of a parent; witnessed domestic violence as a
child; reckless driving; isolation; chronic alcohol abuse; history
of psychiatric hospitalization; history of arrests or antisocial
behavior; and hallucinations, delusions, depression, mania, and
paranoia. The more a caregiver presents these factors and, most
important, if the caregiver has a known history of violent or
aggressive behaviors toward people, the more dangerous he or
she is to others and to his or her children.

In this chapter, I discuss what it means to substantiate a case
and how to best make this decision. The reader must keep in
mind that these comments are general and intended for a
national audience. There is no substitute for a thorough knowledge
of statutes and substantiation guidelines that relate specifically
to one's state.


? <i>What Is Substantiation?</i>


<i>Substantiation</i> is basically a statement by the worker that "I have
enough evidence to believe that child maltreatment has occurred."
To make effective decisions, one needs to understand
what constitutes maltreatment and "good enough" evidence.
What constitutes child maltreatment in one state may not constitute
child maltreatment in another state. Similarly, some state
policies dictate the substantiation of cases based on having adequate
"credible evidence," whereas other states substantiate at
more restrictive levels such as a "preponderance of the evidence."
The substantiation decision depends on the answers to two
questions: "Is the harm to the child severe enough to constitute

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>What Is Not Substantiation?</i>


Substantiation is not a risk assessment or an evaluation of what
services the client will need in the future. Risk assessments are
attempts to predict the likelihood that the child will be maltreated
in the future. Substantiation is a statement about what the worker
believes happened in the past. In fact, a report may be unsubstantiated
based on available evidence about what has already occurred,
but there may be substantial future risk to the child.
Similarly, in substantiated cases, the child is sometimes no longer
at risk, such as in instances in which the perpetrator no longer
has access to the child.


? <i>Evaluating Harm</i>


Sometimes, harm is so severe that it is easily evaluated, as in the
case of serious physical trauma or neglect. In these cases, evaluation
is straightforward. Often, however, the severity of harm is
ambiguous. When is a bruise inflicted during corporal punishment
severe enough to warrant classification as child maltreatment?
This depends on the seriousness of the bruise, the location
on the body, the age of the child, the situation in which the
punishment occurred, the laws of the state, the guidelines of the
child protective agency, and many other factors.

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In addition to the issues of severity and circumstance, another
complicating factor is that sometimes workers are forced to deal
with potential rather than actual harm. For example, an infant
who was permitted to repeatedly crawl into a busy street would
be evaluated by most workers as a victim of serious neglect even
though the harm was only potential. Such potential harm can be
far more serious than the actual harm found in other cases.


Skill in evaluating complicated cases is developed only with
experience and with a thorough knowledge of one's agency's
procedures, both formal and informal. Most agencies recognize
this and provide extensive on-the-job training. Supervisors and
experienced workers are generally able to provide useful guidance.


? <i>Evaluating Evidence</i>


As with harm, evaluating evidence can be straightforward or
tricky. The worker must evaluate all available information regarding
its reliability and the degree to which it contributes to the
overall picture. Often, there is simply not sufficient evidence
available to determine if a particular injury or other form of harm
could be attributed to maltreatment. This is especially likely when
dealing with preverbal or young children. Sometimes, however,
if enough evidence is gathered, a clear picture will emerge. For
example, consider a report alleging that a 14-month-old child has
two black eyes. The parents report that the child had fallen
forward and hit the bridge of his nose on a coffee table, and that
the bruises formed soon after. They also report that their family
doctor told them not to worry about the bruising because a sharp
blow to the bridge of the nose could easily cause such bilateral
bruising. What evidence is available? The child was clearly learning
to walk, and the coffee table did have a sharp edge and was
the correct height for the child to hit his nose on it. Furthermore,
close examination of the child revealed a slight lateral bruise or
abrasion across the bridge of the child's nose that was so small
that even the parents did not notice it. This mark was perfectly
straight, consistent with hitting a hard, level edge. In this case,
despite the age of the child and the seriousness of the injury, the
evidence forms a clear and internally consistent picture that does
not indicate the possibility of child maltreatment.

? <i>Some Ways Your Assessment Can
Help Your Substantiation Decision</i>


Prior planning in the assessment process can help you to obtain
better information. It is best to interview people before they can
compare their stories or alter evidence. It is also important to be
as prepared as possible before you interview the victim so that
you can ask more detailed and specific questions. It is helpful to
interview the reporting party first both to learn more and to
evaluate reliability. It is also important to interview the victim in
a neutral setting if possible (see Chapters 13 and 14, this volume).
It is important to evaluate the reliability of all information
received and to place more importance on statements or physical
evidence in which you have greater confidence. It is helpful to
ask yourself, "Of all this information, what am I more or less sure
of?"


? <i>Where to Go for Help</i>


The inability to make a substantiation decision is usually due to
the worker having inadequate information. Therefore, if you are
in a quandary, the first question you should ask is "Where can I
get more information?" Potential sources include other witnesses
to the event and other people who know the child, family, or
alleged perpetrator well. As you analyze the information that you
have collected, it may be helpful to talk through what you know
with your supervisor or a senior colleague or professionals representing
other disciplines, such as medicine or law enforcement.
If your agency supports multidisciplinary teams, these can be both
a great source of information and a good means of working
through the decision-making process. To maximize your consultation
with others, you should briefly outline the main points of
the case and then ask specific questions. Sometimes, the simple
act of recalling the specifics of the case and formulating your
questions can be all the help you need.

Chapter 3 outlined the various ways in which omissions in
care to meet a child's basic needs may result in significant
harm or a risk of significant harm. Although the actual
determination of whether a child should be considered neglected
must be made based on definitions in specific state laws, this
chapter outlines methods for analyzing information to determine
whether basic needs are unmet at a level that may be termed
neglect. Other chapters in this book outline methods for interviewing
children and other family members, making observations
about the home, and using medical reports and other documents
to determine whether a child has been maltreated. Particularly
with neglect, it is important that the assessment be broad and
consider the ecological context in which the child exists--the
family, the home, the neighborhood, and the broader community.


? <i>Analysis of Information
and Decision Making</i>


The decision about whether certain conditions or circumstances
should be considered neglect is made based on the answers to two
questions: (a) Do the conditions or circumstances indicate that a

<i>Unmet Basic Needs</i>


This section provides examples of ways in which a child's basic
needs may be unmet. Because other chapters in this book focus
on psychological maltreatment (including emotional neglect), the
examples provided here emphasize the ways in which a child's
physical and educational needs may be unmet. In some cases,
additional discussion is provided in other chapters. For other
examples, suggestions are offered to further assess the degree to
which the condition has reached a threshold that might be labeled
neglect due to harm or a threat of harm to the child. The examples
are as follows:

with needed care for physical injury, acute illnesses, physical
disabilities, or chronic condition or impairment

<b>
<i>Significant Harm or
Threat of Significant Harm</i>

Because of the various ways in which a child's basic needs may
be unmet, it is impossible to identify the ways in which children
are harmed as a result of their experiences with the previously
discussed conditions. Both short-term and long-term consequences
result from neglect. Both need to be considered because
sometimes neglectful conditions are not detected until the pattern
is chronic and someone notices the harm. The effects of harm are
as follows:

and injuries from fires or other household hazards; see Chapters

? <i>Summary</i>


Determining whether a child is neglected requires the collection
of adequate information to assess the degree to which omissions
in care have resulted in significant harm or a significant risk of
harm. Unlike other forms of maltreatment, this determination
may not be possible by assessing one incident; rather, it is often
understood by examining patterns of care over time. Therefore,
assessments must consider the nature of the current care in
addition to the history of care. In general, younger children are
more vulnerable to certain types of omissions because these may
result in significant harm, even after short periods of time.


The analysis of information should focus on understanding
how the child's basic needs are met and identifying situations that
may indicate specific omissions in care that have resulted in harm
or a risk of harm. Community and cultural standards should be
considered when determining whether conditions or circumstances
harm children. It must be acknowledged, however, that
sometimes community practices, such as leaving young children
home alone, may still be harmful to children and considered
neglectful even though they may be common practices. With
certain types of neglect, specialists are needed to document that
the harm is likely related to a specific omission in care. When
concern suggests a threat of harm, this becomes even more
complicated; therefore, when possible, community resources
should be employed to help families address needs before specific
negative consequences are observed.

There are a few useful principles that help determine
whether the circumstances should be considered neglect
(see Chapter 3, this volume). Neglect is usually a concern
if the lack of care results in actual harm or the risk of significant
harm, but specific state definitions need to be considered. Many
lapses in health care do not meet this definition. Recommendations
may be made for medical care, and although it is best to
follow these recommendations, it is possible that no harm is likely
if the recommendations are not followed. An example is a
follow-up appointment for a child who had an ear infection but
now appears to be fine. Such situations should not be considered
neglect.


The following are important questions to answer. In most
instances, it is necessary to work closely with health care professionals
to assess possible medical neglect.


<i>Does the child's condition reflect inadequate health care?</i> The
answer is sometimes straightforward, such as when an infant is
severely dehydrated and there is a delay in seeking care that
aggravates the baby's condition. This question is often difficult
to answer, however. A child may have terrible asthma and still
have frequent problems, despite doing everything in the medical

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>How does one know the risk of significant harm?</i> To answer this
question, knowledge of the specific child's condition is valuable.
For example, it may be clear from past experience that if a child
does not receive his or her seizure medicine, a seizure could result.
Knowledge of some conditions can also help answer this question.
Research has determined, for example, that children with
high lead levels are prone to complications; if the problem is left
untreated, it is neglect.


<i>How does one assess the different levels of severity of harm?</i>
Situations vary enormously. Some are life threatening, whereas
others are relatively minor. The specific circumstances and risks
need to be weighed in each case to assess the level of severity and
determine the appropriate intervention. Less serious situations
may be best handled by the health care system and other community
agencies, and child protective services should be involved
only if the efforts of these agencies do not succeed.


<i>How does one assess single or rare lapses in care?</i> There is a natural
inclination to recognize "human fallibility" and accept single
lapses in care. It may seem reasonable, for example, that the
parent did not appreciate the level of lethargy of the child. It may
not be reasonable, however, when a child has been vomiting and
in pain for days before medical care is sought. From a child's
standpoint, even a single lapse in care could have fatal results. In
practice, it is understandable that repeated or chronic lapses in
care will be viewed much more seriously.

<i>How does one assess care that may not benefit the child?</i> Medical
treatment may be recommended when it is not clear that the child
will benefit or the side effects of treatment raise questions regarding
the net benefit. An example is experimental treatment for
some cancers. Neglect occurs only when it is clear that a child is
being denied a significant benefit by not receiving an available
treatment.


<i>What if reasons other than parental omissions are responsible for
the child being medically neglected?</i> This is often true. An adolescent
may refuse to take a medicine. There may be domestic
violence contributing to a chaotic home. There may be a lack of
health insurance. Physicians may not communicate the plan
carefully. These are a few examples of possible contributors to
medical neglect. The child, parents, family, and medical system
as well as the health problem, the treatment, and the doctor-family
relationship and communication need to be assessed to understand
why a child's need for medical care is neglected to intervene
appropriately.


Parental beliefs about health care based on their religion or
culture may result in children not receiving necessary medical
attention, sometimes leading to serious harm or death. Most
states have "religious exemptions" laws excluding different religious
healing practices from being viewed as neglect. The American
Academy of Pediatrics, however, has advocated that every
child should have access to necessary medical care, and this
should be the priority regardless of the parents' religious beliefs.
From a child's perspective, the lack of medical care, for any
reason, that results in significant harm should be considered
medical neglect. When this is due to different religious or cultural
beliefs, it is best that the situation be handled with the utmost
sensitivity and an attempt to forge a reasonable compromise
should be made. Chapter 20, this volume, discusses this difficult
dilemma.

Parents may feel frustrated that their child is "a picky eater."
The concern of inadequate nutrition, however, usually
occurs when a health care provider notes that a child's
growth pattern is poor, making the diagnosis of "failure to
thrive." Using growth charts based on many children, one can
follow growth trends for girls and boys. Failure to thrive (FTT)
is diagnosed when a child's weight or height decreases below the
5th percentile or across two major percentile lines (e.g., from the
80th to the 40th) or when a child's weight/height (how much the
child weighs considering his or her height) decreases below the
10th percentile. Chronic undernutrition may result in short
children (height per age lower than the 5th percentile), whereas
their weight may appear satisfactory. Physicians have often considered
FTT as <i>organic</i> when there is a serious medical condition,
<i>nonorganic</i> when there is no medical condition and the cause is
considered to be "psychosocial," or <i>mixed</i> when there are both
medical and psychosocial problems.


Poor growth, however, does not always reflect poor nutrition.
Some medical conditions, such as cyanotic heart disease, can limit
growth. Some children are normally small, particularly if they
have small parents. Their growth increases with a normal trend,
but they remain small. Some children may have had problems

? <i>How to Assess the Adequacy of the Diet</i>


<b>
<i>History</i>
</b>


A child may describe frequently being hungry without there
being food in the home. Family members, a teacher, and others
may support the child's view. Parents may acknowledge the
problem of running out of food. Pediatricians can assess whether
there are gross deficiencies, such as when children receive excessive
fruit juice. Nutritionists may ask a parent about everything
the child ate in the past 24 hours to estimate more precisely the
adequacy of the diet. Also, children can experience considerable
hunger without it affecting their growth.


<b>
<i>Observation</i>
</b>


A child may be observed by health care professionals, teachers,
or others to be obviously hungry, looking for or asking for food.
The effect on behavior may be more subtle, such as when a hungry
child has difficulty concentrating in school. The physical examination
usually reveals little information in cases of mild under-nutrition.
Certainly, growth may be affected; growth is the most
used characteristic. A child may appear pale (anemic). Other
physical signs are present if the problem is more severe, including
(paradoxically) a large belly, an enlarged liver, and coarse hair.

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Deficiencies in specific nutrients (e.g., vitamin D) lead to specific
diseases (e.g., rickets) with characteristic findings. Nutritionists
may perform more refined measurements of skin folds and the
arm circumference to assess nutritional status.


<b>
<i>Laboratory Tests</i>
</b>


These tests are often done to rule out the possibility of medical
problems accounting for poor growth. Tests also sometimes
confirm undernutrition, such as when a lack of iron causes
anemia or blood protein or zinc levels are low. Very rarely,
children who are short lack growth or other hormones.


? <i>Summary</i>


In summary, caseworkers can obtain useful information from
children, family members, and teachers regarding hunger, availability
of food, diet, and behavior. Talking to the child's primary
health care provider should be valuable, and in more serious cases
a nutritionist's evaluation is recommended. Ideally, an interdisciplinary
team that is expert in growth and failure to thrive should
help assess and manage moderate or severe growth problems. If
a child's nutritional needs are not met for any reason, this is a
form of neglect. An appropriate response should be tailored to
the specific reasons for the inadequate nutrition.

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When can a child be left alone? When is lack of supervision
neglect? In what circumstances should child
protective services intervene? It is known that many
children experience inadequate supervision because caregivers
are overburdened or overwhelmed, have alcohol or drug problems,
are poor and live in poor housing, have conflict with other
caregivers, lack adequate child care resources when they are at
work, are unable to manage parent-child conflict problems, or all
these. It is also known that children who experience inadequate
supervision are likely to have psychosocial adjustment problems,
such as problems with peer relations and behavior. Intervention
will be most successful if we identify and respond to problems
early.


? <i>Types of Supervision Problems</i>


1. Child left unattended: A child is left alone unsupervised.


2. Child left in the care of an unsuitable substitute caregiver:
The person responsible is unable to provide adequate care
(e.g., the child is left in care of young sibling, a known child

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

3. Child left in the care of a suitable caregiver but without
proper planning or consent: The caregiver leaves the child
but does not return when scheduled or has a history of
leaving the child without providing essentials for care (e.g.,
diapers).


4. Caregiver inadequately supervising child: The caregiver is
with the child but is unable or unwilling to supervise (e.g.,
the caregiver is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is
depressed, sleeps during the day, or has inadequate parenting
knowledge or skill).


5. Child permitted, encouraged, or not restrained from engaging
in harmful activity: The child is locked out of the house
or permitted to stay out all night, uses alcohol or drugs, is
chronically delinquent, is involved in prostitution, or demonstrates
aggressive behavior.


? <i>Factors to Consider When Determining Whether
Inadequate Supervision Is Neglect</i>


Unfortunately, there is no formula to help one to decide when a
child can safely be unsupervised. As practitioners that care about
children, it is important that we consider a range of possible
intervention responses to help caregivers meet the supervision
needs of their children. The factors that guide assessment of the
nature of supervision are the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Age of child: A consensus on a standard age by which
children can be left unattended has not be achieved. Most
professionals agree that children who are under the age of
8 and left alone are definitely neglected, and that children
older than age 12 are able to spend 1 or 2 hours alone each
day. The following factors need to be considered, particularly
when children are between the ages of 8 and 12.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Child's personal resources: The child's physical condition
and mental abilities, coping capacity, maturity, competence,
knowledge about how to respond in an emergency, feelings
about being alone, and so on need to be assessed.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>

3. Degree and format of indirect adult supervision: Is there an
adult nearby who is available to the child or in frequent
contact with the child by telephone, and has the child been
prepared about how to deal with an emergency or threat?
</td></tr></table>

1. Age of child: A consensus on a standard age by which
children can be left unattended has not be achieved. Most
professionals agree that children who are under the age of
8 and left alone are definitely neglected, and that children
older than age 12 are able to spend 1 or 2 hours alone each
day. The following factors need to be considered, particularly
when children are between the ages of 8 and 12.


2. Child's personal resources: The child's physical condition
and mental abilities, coping capacity, maturity, competence,
knowledge about how to respond in an emergency, feelings
about being alone, and so on need to be assessed.

4. Duration and frequency: Is this something that occurs for
short periods of time, or is the child left alone all day, every
day (e.g., during the summer)? Are the unattended periods
during the day or during the night?


5. Nature of the child's residential environment: There is a
need to assess the degree of safety in the environment--for
example, the level of crime, urban versus rural, access to a
telephone, other children in the household, safety of the
home, the presence of gangs or groups that encourage
delinquent activity, vulnerability in the neighborhood to
sexual exploitation or abuse, physical injury, and exposure
to substance abuse.


? <i>Conclusions</i>


Many families need to make arrangements for their children that
are not optimal. The number of latchkey children is increasing,
not decreasing. The previously discussed factors should be considered
in helping families make safe arrangements for their
children.

For caseworkers, clinicians, and researchers in the field of
child maltreatment, neglect poses some of the thorniest of
assessment decisions. The assessment of neglect among
adolescents may be further compounded by social norms and by
normal adolescent behavior, such as risk taking, defiance, sexual
acting out, and rebellion. Typically, neglect is defined with regard
to adult or parental omissions in relation to a child's needs.
Perhaps neglect is best considered along a continuum and contextually.
Many needs are subject to considerable variation. Questions
of "ideal" versus "adequate" are not absolutes, particularly
regarding adolescents. Specific types of neglect are the same as
those for younger children: medical, educational, emotional, and
supervisory. Regardless of adolescent status, the basic needs of
childhood remain the same (see Table 29.1).


The developmental normal tasks of adolescence entail developing
responsibilities for decision making and increasing
autonomy and self-reliance. Their simultaneous needs for supervision,
nurturance, and affection continue. Balancing autonomy
and supervision can be difficult. Rebellious or apathetic behaviors
may create considerable tension between normal needs, parental
response, and the clinical assessment of neglect. Crucial aspects
of assessment include the following:

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I003&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<i>Family education:</i> Are the adolescent's parents adequately
informed regarding their teen's developmental, educational,
medical, and social needs? Do they clearly
understand the implications of their teen's behavior?
Are their responses based on misunderstanding, frustration,
ignorance, or anger? If so, are they responsive
to corrective suggestions? How do the adolescent and
the family perceive responsibilities in general? For
example, does the teen blame the parent for having
"transmitted" his or her diabetes? Is the adolescent
functioning at or below an age-appropriate level? Do
the parents have unrealistic expectations of an adolescent's
adherence to a medical treatment? For example,
it may be unrealistic to expect the teen to be responsible
for ensuring that prescriptions are kept up-to-date and
refilled. Neglect may take the form of parental under-responsibility
and, in some cases, overinvolvement at
the expense of an adolescent becoming self-sufficient.



[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>High-risk behaviors:</i> What are the rules, roles, and behavioral
norms in the family? Does the family abide by
consistent rules and consequences of behavior? For
example, is a parent aware of an adolescent's choice of
friends and sexual partner(s) or of school attendance?


With the increasing autonomy that characterizes adolescence,
conflicts often occur regarding parental culpability to supervise
and exert control over defiant or self-destructive adolescent
behavior. For example, is a parent aware of an adolescent's
skipping school to pursue a high-risk sexual relationship? What
do the parents know? How do they perceive the problem? What
have they tried to do? Is the parental response constructive or
counterproductive? Are they responsive to suggestions or alternative
problem-solving approaches?


? <i>Conclusion</i>


Questions of neglect typically include issues of deficient adult
attention. The medical and socioeconomic consequences associated
with adolescent drug use, exposure to sexually transmitted
diseases, and risks of violence have escalated during the past
decade. Adolescents and their parents are thus facing increasingly
dire consequences of poor judgment as well as actual neglect.
Therefore, it is crucial for professionals to take an assertive role
in the assessment of and response to neglect as it relates to at-risk
adolescents.

Chapter 4 on defining physical abuse set the stage for
answering this chapter title's question. The key question
is "Could this injury have occurred in a nonabusive
manner?" There should always be a careful effort to obtain a
history from a child and separately from the parent(s) and
possible witnesses of what led to the injury. The challenge is to
then consider whether the explanation given plausibly explains
the physical findings. Different explanations for an injury, sometimes
by the same person, suggest that the true history is not being
revealed. The following are additional "red flags" in the history
suggestive of abuse:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• <i>History does not reasonably fit with the injury:</i> Some
fractures, for example, require considerable force so that
a history of a baby rolling over would be very unlikely to
explain the baby's broken femur (thigh bone). It is valuable
to know about the child's developmental capabilities
to assess the plausibility of some explanations (e.g., an
infant climbing out of the crib with the sides up).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>

• <i>No history offered:</i> Perhaps due to denial, perhaps because
the person genuinely does not know what happened, or
perhaps in an effort to hide abuse, it is common to not
receive any history for an injury ("I don't know how this
happened"). This requires interviewing all primary caregivers
about what might have happened ("Did the baby
fall?" and "Did anyone drop the baby?") to explore both
abusive and noninflicted trauma.

• <i>Disclosure of abuse:</i> If possible, it is critical to interview
the child separately (see chapter 16, this volume). Sometimes,
other family members, including siblings, disclose
what they have witnessed, and occasionally perpetrators
acknowledge their acts.


• <i>Delay in seeking medical care:</i> Denial about the seriousness
of the child's condition, a wish to conceal the abuse,
or a hope that the injury will heal without medical care
may lead to a delay in seeking medical care. It is also true,
however, that with many health problems one's first
assessment may be that it is minor. Only when the problem
persists or worsens is the need for medical attention
clear.


? <i>Nature of the Injury</i>


For some injuries, the characteristics are quite specific for abuse.
For example, an infant with blood around the brain (subdural
hematoma), retinal hemorrhages (bleeding in the back of the
eyes), and fractures of the long bones strongly indicates shaken
baby (or impact) syndrome; there really are no acceptable alternative
explanations for this case. Bruises shaped by the implement
that caused them or in places that seldom get injured accidentally
(e.g., under the neck) may clearly indicate that they were inflicted.
Burns with a pattern that can only have resulted from a child
being forcibly held in hot water are another example. Nevertheless,
the injury alone is often not conclusive, and there is a
need to combine the history with the physical findings and
pertinent psychosocial information.

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Psychosocial Information</i>


Risk factors for abuse, such as substance abuse, mental health
problems, poverty, recent unemployment, domestic violence, and
social isolation, provide a context for understanding what may
have happened to a child. Although they are rarely conclusive in
determining whether abuse occurred, knowledge of the risk
factors can contribute to an assessment of what happened. In
addition, together with assessing strengths and resources, knowing
the risk factors helps guide appropriate interventions.

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The following are needed when physical abuse is suspected:


<i>History of the current incident:</i> The crux of the medical diagnosis
of physical abuse is to determine whether the injury is reasonably
explained by a mechanism other than inflicted trauma. This
means interviewing the child (separately if possible), the parents,
and others who may have witnessed the incident. Before discussing
the details of the alleged abuse, it is useful to develop a basic
understanding of the family, caregiving arrangements, family
relationships (e.g., how people get along), views of the child, and
approaches to discipline. Regarding the suspected abuse, what
happened, who was present, the precipitating events, when and
where it occurred, who the child told, and that person's response
should be determined. The parents' acceptance of the child's
account, level of support, concern about the child's condition,
and motivation to protect the child are all important to assess.


<i>Past medical history:</i> The family and the primary care provider
should be asked about past health problems, injuries, ingestions,
hospital admissions, and visits to emergency departments. This

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Family history:</i> Health problems in the family, such as multiple
fractures or easy bruising, may help determine a diagnosis other
than abuse. Again, psychosocial problems, such as domestic
violence and substance abuse, are areas to probe.


<i>Physical examination:</i> A thorough head-to-toe examination
should be done on all children suspected of having been abused.
There may be hidden signs of trauma (e.g., bruises in unlikely
places) or clues to conditions other than abuse (e.g., blue color
to the white part of the eye in children with the genetic bone
disease, osteogenesis imperfecta). The child's growth pattern
should be checked; poor growth may reflect failure to thrive and
possible child neglect. If the child's condition permits, a developmental
assessment is often valuable (e.g., Denver Developmental
Screening Test). Some of this information can also be obtained
from parents. Knowing a child's capabilities helps assess the
plausibility of the explanation for the injury (e.g., was the baby
able to roll over and off the bed?).


<i>Consultation:</i> Subspecialists can offer valuable assistance in many
instances. If there is access to a pediatrician expert in the area of
child maltreatment, consultation can help determine the likelihood
of abuse. Ophthalmologists are generally consulted to
examine the eyes of babies who may have been violently shaken.
Depending on the specific problem, consultation with the relevant
subspecialist should be considered.


<i>Laboratory tests and special investigations:</i> These studies need to
be tailored to the child's age and the specific problem. Children
younger than 3 years of age who are thought to have sustained
serious trauma should have a complete skeletal survey to check
for possible fractures. If the skeletal survey is normal but there

In summary, suspected physical abuse requires a comprehensive
evaluation (i.e., history, examination, special tests, and consultation)
and careful consideration of alternate explanations for
the child's injury.

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The purposes of ordering medical tests in the evaluation of
suspected physical abuse are to determine
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1 The cause of the child's injury or problem: Is the injury due
to an abusive or unintentional (accidental) event, or is there
a medical explanation for the child's problem?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. The location and severity of the injury and whether other
parts of the body are involved: This information can help

casting of a fracture or drainage of a subdural hematoma
(bleeding around the brain), and on the child's prognosis.

3. The age of the injuries, which can help in deciding whether
abuse has occurred.

? <i>X Rays</i>


X Rays or diagnostic imaging can be used to evaluate the bones,
the head, and the abdomen and chest.


<b>
<i>Bones</i>
</b>


An X ray of an injured area of the body can provide information
about the presence of a fractured bone, the type of fracture
(e.g., transverse [through the shaft of the bone] and spiral [spiraling
around the shaft]), the location of the fracture on the bone,
the age of the fracture, and whether the bones appear normal or
have an underlying problem, such as osteogenesis imperfecta (or
brittle bone disease), that makes them more susceptible to break.
Certain types of fractures are particularly worrisome for abuse,
including the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Fractures in children who are not walking (although such
children can be injured from falls from beds, down stairs,
from parent's arms, etc.)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Rib fractures, especially rib fractures that occur posteriorly
(or adjacent to the spine)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Corner fractures near the growth plate of bones, such as
the tibia (large bone in lower leg) and femur (thigh bone)

• Fractures in children who are not walking (although such
children can be injured from falls from beds, down stairs,
from parent's arms, etc.)


• Rib fractures, especially rib fractures that occur posteriorly
(or adjacent to the spine)


• Corner fractures near the growth plate of bones, such as
the tibia (large bone in lower leg) and femur (thigh bone)


The X ray can provide information that allows an estimate of
the age of the fracture: acute or recent, 10 to 14 days old, or at
least several weeks old. An acute or recent fracture shows the
fracture line and, if seen shortly after the event, may show swelling
surrounding the fracture. The first sign of healing that can
be seen on an X ray is the formation of callus or new bone, and
this occurs approximately 10 to 14 days after a bone is broken.
As the healing becomes more pronounced (evidenced by more
extensive callus formation), the injury is estimated to be several
weeks old.


A skeletal survey includes X rays of all the bones in the body.
This can be a particularly helpful test to determine whether the
child has other fractures (either acute or healing) that are not
suspected from the clinical examination. This test is ordered if

At some medical centers, another test that can be used to
detect fractures is a bone scan. In this test, a radioactive substance
is injected intravenously into the bloodstream and then localizes
at fractures sites. This test often is used to search for new rib
fractures, which can be difficult to detect by X ray until callus
formation occurs 10 to 14 days after the injury.


<b>
<i>Head</i>
</b>


X rays can determine whether a bone of the skull is fractured
or whether there is soft tissue swelling on the outside of the skull.
X rays, however, cannot show the brain and therefore are less
helpful than other tests, including computed tomography (CT)
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).


CT can provide information about the brain, the skull bones,
and tissue swelling outside the skull. A CT provides images of the
head in thin slices so that details of the anatomy can be examined.
A CT is necessary to detect injuries of the brain, such as subdural
hematomas (bleeding around the brain), intracerebral hematomas
(bleeding in the brain tissue), or swelling of the brain tissue.
A CT also can be useful in estimating the age of the injury. Because
CT scanners are widely available, the CT is the test of choice in
evaluating children with suspected head injuries.


A MRI is the best test to detect small areas of bleeding in or
around the brain and to follow the progression or resolution of
an injury of the brain. Thus, a MRI can be helpful in determining
the child's prognosis related to the brain injuries. In conjunction
with the CT, the MRI can be helpful in estimating the age of the
injury. Like the CT, the MRI provides images of the head in thin
slices. Young children often need to be sedated or given anesthesia
so that they will not move during the scan.

<b>
<i>Abdomen and Chest</i>
</b>


CT or MRI scans can provide detailed information about
internal injuries, such as lacerations of the liver or spleen.


? <i>Ophthalmologic Examination</i>


An eye exam by an ophthalmologist is requested when a young
child has an injury of the head that might be due to shaken baby
syndrome. The ophthalmologist dilates the pupils and examines
the retina (back of the eye) for signs of retinal hemorrhages
(bleeding). Such hemorrhages occur very infrequently in accidental
head injuries but very commonly in infants with shaken baby
syndrome. This examination of the eyes is also commonly requested
as part of an evaluation of an infant whose major injury
does not affect the head but there is concern about possible abuse.


? <i>Blood Tests</i>


<b>
<i>Hemoglobin</i>
</b>


Almost every child admitted to the hospital takes a hemoglobin
test to determine whether the child is anemic. In children with
internal bleeding (e.g., in the head, abdomen, and thigh), the
hemoglobin often is low. If it is dangerously low, a child may
require a transfusion.


<b>
<i>Clotting Tests</i>
</b>


Blood tests (including platelet count, prothrombin time, partial
thromboplastic time, and bleeding time) can be helpful in
determining whether the child's blood clots normally or whether
the child has a medical condition that predisposes the child to
easy bleeding and bruising. For example, children with very low
platelet counts often have areas of bleeding into the skin that may
look like multiple bruises from physical abuse.

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In some children with serious brain injuries, the fresh tissue
damage in the brain can result in abnormal clotting studies. When
these studies are repeated later in the course of the child's
recovery, they are normal, indicating that the clotting abnormality
was the result and not the cause of the head injury.


? <i>Special Tests</i>


Many special tests and consultations with pediatric specialists can
be obtained when evaluating a child with an injury suspicious for
child abuse. For example, a genetic consultation from an expert
in the areas of genetics, diseases of metabolism, and congenital
abnormalities can sometimes be helpful in determining whether
the child's growth failure is due to an underlying problem or a
failure to provide the child with adequate calories. A test that
should be discussed is a skin biopsy.


<b>
<i>Skin Biopsy</i>
</b>


Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI; brittle bones) is a very rare
disease in which bones are more susceptible than normal bones
to break from minor trauma. Although this disease can usually be
detected by examination of the child and a review of the X rays,
mild forms of the disease may occasionally be confused with child
abuse. To confirm the diagnosis of OI or to distinguish between
abuse and OI, it is helpful to obtain a skin biopsy from the child.
This biopsy is sent to a special laboratory in which the fibroblast
cells in the skin are grown and then tested to determine if the
disease is present. In 85% of individuals with clinical signs of the
disease, the test is positive for OI.

? <i>What Type of Conditions May Be Mistaken for Abuse?</i>


A child with a variety of conditions may appear to have been
injured. Determining the type of injury is generally easier than
determining if the injury was self-inflicted, inflicted intentionally,
or noninflicted. Type of injuries include burning with heat and
caustics, impacting, puncturing, cutting, tattooing, pinching,
freezing, suction, and ligating or binding. Children may be accidentally
or intentionally injured by a variety of means. Because
the body surface of skin is most accessible to the child, caretakers,
and the environment, it is important to recognize birthmarks,
self-inflicted trauma, and common inflicted and noninflicted
injuries and to understand; how the skin reacts to trauma.


? <i>Bruises and Other Color Marks</i>


Bruises are the most common manifestations of injury seen by
hospital based pediatricians who report abuse, and the hand is
the most "available" instrument used to explore the environment
and mete out discipline and anger. Individuals who care for

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Bruise colors include black, blue, red, purple, green, yellow,
and brown. Birthmarks or paint and stains of these colors may be
mistaken for injury. Mongolian spots are slate blue birthmarks
that are most commonly found on the back and buttocks of
dark-skinned infants, but they may appear on any part of the
body. Capillary hemangiomas, or "stork bites," are red birth-marks
that appear on the base of the nose and nape of the neck.
Both types of birthmarks fade by 6 years of age and may have
been noted on birth records. They are easily differentiated from
bruises that fade by 14 to 21 days and undergo color changes as
they resolve. Pigmented nevi, another form of birthmark, can
range from deep black and blue to light brown (café au lait) in
color. They do not resolve in time. Dark-skinned children may
show patches of vitiligo or loss of skin pigment, which may
resemble depigmented scars from burns or other trauma. Dark-skinned
children may also have scars with increased pigment.


? <i>Impact and Skin Color Change</i>


A mild impact to the skin will cause blood vessels to enlarge,
resulting in erythema or redness that fades in hours. More severe
impact results in rupture of blood vessels. Small ruptures cause
petechiae (or dot-like bruises), and large ruptures cause bruises
over a wider area: A variety of infectious diseases may cause
erythema or petechiae. Their location and association with systemic
symptoms including fever should decrease the possibility
of a misdiagnosis of intentional injury. As blood vessels dilate,
fluid leaks out, causing edema or swelling. A hive, which results
from erythema and edema, can be blanched by putting pressure
on the skin. Children, peers, or caretakers can apply various
pigments to a child's skin. Applied colors generally are easily
removed. Dyes such as henna may persist for weeks. Puncturing
the skin with pigment (tattooing) is an unusual form of inflicted
injury and results in deep and permanent color changes.

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Burns</i>


Heated skin will turn red (erythema or first-degree burn) and then
blister or vesiculate (second-degree burn). In third-degree burns,
caused by higher temperature and longer exposure, the skin may
be charred from flames or white and senseless from scalds. The
burn source may be from a heated object, which will leave an
imprint, or hot liquid or caustic that may flow or splash. Lime
and garlic juice may erode the skin, resulting in what appears to
be a burn. Severe diaper dermatitis from monilia (yeast) may
involve the entire diaper area with bright red skin in a pattern
that suggests an immersion burn. At the edge of the red area, red
papules or satellites are seen and represent new colonies of yeast.
Immersion burns have a straight or slightly wavy border and spare
skin creases that are protected when the child flexes various body
parts.


? <i>Allergy, Infection, and Poor Hygiene</i>


Any redness from allergy, infection; or poor hygien in the anal
or genital region may be mistaken for redness from sexual abuse.
Lichen sclerosis, an unusual skin disease that cause redness and
fragile skin in the genital area, should not be mistaken for genital
trauma. Falls rarely tear the hymen. A torn hymen is diagnostic
of penetration. The most common infectious disease resulting in
vesicles (fluid containing bumbs), is chicken pox. In bacterial
infections that cause vesicles, the skin is tender, and the fluid is
thicker and generally yellow. The size of craters from healing
chicken are scratched, they become larger. Impetigo, a common
skin infection, begins as a papule (skin bump) that progresses to
a pustule (bump with yellow or white pus). When the pustule
ruptures, the red pit left in the skin may resemble the round red
pit that results when a blister from a cigarette burn ruptures.
Generally, impetigo occurs in clusters, and the primary lesion, a
small pustule, is generally present. Scratching the lesions thickens
the skin and spreads the infection. Insect bites, which are found
on exposed skin surfaces, begin as small, red macules (flat skin
mark) that may progress to papules or vesicles. Children may dig

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The green and yellow color pattern of resolving bruises is not
seen in other skin diseases. A caregiver may claim that a child
bruises easily. This observation is generally for a fair-skinned
child, who show bruises more readily than a dark-skinned child.
Laboratory tests can rule out bleeding problems. In rare bleeding
disorders such as hemophilia, the blood vessel must be traumatized
for bleeding to occur. Children with hemophilia are at
increased risk for abuse, as are children with other chronic
diseases who stress their parent's emotional and financial resources.
Parents may claim that a baby with multiple fractures
easily breaks his or her bones. Osteogenesis imperfecta, in-which
bones are fragile, exists in mild to severe forms. A normal family
history for fractures, review of bones fractured, normal bone
mineralization, and otherwise normal physical examination
should rule out this very rare condition. A skin biopsy can
establish the diagnosis with 85% certainty.


? <i>Unusual Marks</i>


Children may puncture or lacerate themselves intentionally or
unintentionally. Retarded or emotionally disturbed children may
self-mutilate. Deep scratching may create lines that may be
mistaken for lacerations from cords. The marks from an intentional
scratch are linear but narrower than expected from an adult
hand, and they are found only on areas of the body that the child
can reach. A child may apply suction marks. The oval-shaped
bruises appear on parts of the body the child can reach with his
or her mouth. Sucker ("love") bites may be applied by perpetrators
in Munchausen syndrome by proxy and during sexual abuse.
The marks are larger than those from a child's mouth. Intentional
smothering with a soft object, which can cause brain damage or
death, results in autopsy findings that cannot be distinguished
from those of sudden infant death syndrome. Occasionally, adult
hand marks are found on the face of a child who was smothered.
Strangling about the neck causes petechiae of the face; straining

? <i>How to Examine the skin</i>


When examining the skin, all lesions should be carefully mapped
on a drawing of the body. The pattern, shape, size, and location
are helpful in determining the cause. When questions exist about
the cause of an injury, medical consultation should be sought. The
pattern of marks and surfaces injured may suggest intentional
injury. Leading body surfaces, such as the brow, shins, elbows,
and forearms, are more likely to be injured in accidents. The
protected genitalia and anus are rarely injured unintentionally.
Attention needs to be paid to the structures underlying the skin.
Blows to the skin may result in trauma to deeper structures, such
as muscles, bones, and other organs. The curved pattern of
tear-shaped knuckle marks on the abdomen may overlie a ruptured
liver, spleen, or bowel.


? <i>The History May Help Make the Diagnosis</i>


Reporting accidental, congenital, or self-inflicted injury as child
abuse will have adverse consequences to the child and family. In
contrast, the failure to recognize and report child abuse will have
adverse affects on the child and the professional. The history of
how the injury occurred must be evaluated to determine if it is in
keeping with the child's developmental level and the injury. One
should report suspected child abuse to appropriate agencies when
an injury is not congruent with the history or the child's development.
Injuries that are commonly or easily preventable should
be reported as "safe neglect." Children who are older than 3
years of age have sufficient language ability and should be asked
about the cause of the injury.

The skin (see Chapter 33, this volume) and other organs
have limited responses to trauma. A history must be
obtained for every injury sustained by a child. Parents who
injure their children, however, rarely give an accurate or truthful
history. They may avoid bringing children with minor injuries to
medical attention or delay seeking attention for more severe
injuries, hoping that they may heal. Children with new injuries
must be thoroughly examined to search for old injuries. Deep
skin injuries heal with a scar that mimics the shape of the
offending instrument. Fractures may heal so completely that they
cannot be detected. If healing fractures or injury scars are found,
in addition to acute injuries, this suggests "child abuse syndrome"
or inflicted injuries that have occurred on more than one occasion.
The mark from an object wielded by a perpetrator may not
be different from a mark that results when the child runs into or
falls onto the object. In the latter case, the force of impact by the
child will depend on the child's weight, speed, and distance
traveled to the object as well as the character of the surface struck.
Similarly, marks from instruments wielded by a perpetrator will
also depend on the characteristics of the surface and the force
used for hitting the child. If the injury has the shape of a hand,
paddle, cord, spoon, shoe, or pan, it is unlikely that the child ran

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Child Development and
Recognizing Child Abuse</i>


One must be familiar with child development to determine if the
history of an injury is credible. Perpetrators may blame the child
or a sibling for causing an injury. They may state that the child
rolled off the bed, crawled or ran into an object, fell down stairs,
or turned on hot water or turned off cold water. If the child's
development, or tested capability (some children are advanced,
whereas others are delayed), is not compatible with the history,
inflicted injury must be suspected.


? <i>Vulnerable Body Parts</i>


The leading edges of the body, such as the shins, forearms, and
brow, are most likely to be injured in falls. Children who are
running generally fall forward. The buttocks and thighs, back,
ears, upper arms, and genitalia are areas most likely to be injured
by caregivers.


The pattern of a burn also indicates its origin. Stocking, glove,
and diaper area burns that spare areas of the body that are
protected by flexion are likely due to immersion. This burn
pattern and a lack of splash marks are diagnostic of an immersion
burn.


Highly suspect injuries for child abuse include metaphyseal,
rib, scapula, and sternum fractures and spiral fractures of the legs
or arms in preambulating children. Falls rarely cause geometric,
patterned, paired, or symmetrical burns or bruises. A blow to the
nose or forehead (which leaves a mark) can cause the soft tissue
around both eyes to bruise (black eyes). A basal skull fracture can
cause bruises about the eyes or behind the ears.


A caregiver may claim that a child became unconscious after
a fall from a bed, table, or chair. If the child's head struck an
object during the fall, one would expect to see the mark of the
object on the skin. A young child with no external signs of injury

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Changing Stories</i>


After caregivers have obtained legal consultation, the original
story may change or be denied. A careful record of each history
is necessary to document this behavior. Neglect must be considered
in all poisonings, especially those with mind-altering drugs.
Caregivers on medication may intentionally give children their
medications to change the children's behavior. Such drugs may
impair judgment, coordination, and balance. Cases in which
children are not in proper and required restraints and are involved
in auto accidents should be reported for safety neglect.


? <i>Summary</i>


One must approach each injury of a child with an open but
suspicious mind about possible causes. A detailed history, with a
time line and verification of all data from other sources, should
be carefully recorded on specific forms that ensure that all
information is collected and all necessary laboratory work ordered.
The size, shape, age, color, and cause of each injury should
be charted along with details of the child's developmental capabilities.

Shaken baby syndrome (SBS) refers to a constellation of
symptoms and signs that occur after an infant, usually less
than 1 year of age, has been violently shaken. Such an infant
often has bleeding around the brain, bleeding in the back of the
eyes, and other signs of abuse, such as bruises and fractures.


? <i>Presenting Symptoms and Signs</i>


Infants with SBS may be brought to the physician because of
irritability, decreased appetite, vomiting, or sleepiness. In more
severe cases, the child may be unresponsive and have seizures or
difficulty breathing. Important clues on the physical examination
include irritability, lethargy or coma, a bulging anterior fontanelle
(soft spot on the head), an enlarged head circumference, seizures,
decreased frequency of breathing or even apnea (periods of not
breathing), and bruises. Because parents do not provide information
about the shaking when the child is first brought for care,
other diagnoses, such as gastroenteritis and meningitis, are sometimes
considered, and the diagnosis of SBS can be delayed. When

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00185&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Making the Diagnosis</i>


Because infants with SBS often are very sick (and may even die),
clinicians will first stabilize the child by giving medications to
control seizures and ensuring that the child is breathing at a
normal rate; this sometimes requires inserting a breathing tube
and placing the child on a ventilator (breathing machine). The
following diagnostic tests can be helpful:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI):</i> The diagnosis of SBS is usually made by CT
when subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhages (bleeding
around the brain) are noted. Additional findings
include evidence of fractures of the bones of the skull,
bleeding in the brain, shearing injuries of the brain, and
brain swelling. Findings on the CT and MRI can help
estimate the age of the injury and determine whether
there was a single episode or more than one episode of
bleeding. The MRI is also helpful in detecting smaller
areas of bleeding in the brain and in following the
progression or resolution of the abnormalities.
</p>
<p>
<i>Ophthalmologic evaluation:</i> In approximately 75% of children
with SBS, there is evidence of retinal hemorrhages
(bleeding in the back of the eye). These hemorrhages
usually resolve within several weeks and usually do not
affect the child's ability to see.
</p>
<p>
<i>Skeletal survey:</i> The most frequently noted fractures in
children with SBS are rib fractures. These fractures are
usually located posteriorly next to the spine or laterally.
At the time of the diagnosis of SBS, the rib fractures
often have callus formation, indicating that these fractures
are healing and at least 10 to 14 days old. Healing
fractures of the ribs and an acute subdural hematoma
indicate that the child has been abused on at least two

fractures of other bones.

? <i>How SBS Occurs</i>


The injuries of a child with SBS are due to violent shaking of the
infant; in many cases, the child's head is also struck on a hard
surface, such as a mattress or a crib railing. The abuser is often a
male caretaker, such as the father, stepfather, or mother's boyfriend,
but can also be the mother or baby-sitter. The injuries
occur when the adult becomes frustrated with the infant's behaviors,
such as crying or spitting, grabs the infant under the arms,
loses control, and vigorously shakes the baby. During the shaking,
the infant's head snaps back and forth causing shearing strains
that result in bleeding around the brain and injuries in the brain.
Some experts believe that shaking alone is not enough to cause
the bleeding and the injuries in the head; these experts believe
that the damage occurs due to the rotational forces when the
infant's head strikes a firm surface. Skull fractures occur when
the infant's head strikes a hard object. The rib fractures occur
from the squeezing of the rib cage. Normal care of children, including
playful tossing of an infant in the air, does not cause SBS.


? <i>Prognosis</i>


SBS is the major cause of death due to abuse in young children.
Of the children who survive, many have moderate or severe
neurological symptoms, including seizures, mental retardation,
learning disabilities, motor abnormalities, and visual impairments.

Adolescents are a remarkably heterogeneous and unpredictable
population. Not all abused adolescents become
aggressive or assaultive, nor have all assaultive or aggressive
adolescents been abused. Thoughtful, comprehensive assessments
are necessary to serve the needs of assaultive adolescents
and to diminish the likelihood of a subsequent assaultive adulthood
or abusive parenthood.


By definition, assaultive incidents are more than outbursts of
unmanaged temper and impulsivity, and they represent a variety
of problem behaviors and circumstances. Ironically, despite clear
indications that adolescent court involvement, ungovernable behavior,
delinquency, and substance abuse are often associated
with child abuse histories, such adolescents are more likely to be
routed through the juvenile justice system than the child protection
system.


The role of social work in the assessment of assaultive adolescents
is crucial to address the context in which violence occurs.
A comprehensive assessment necessarily requires multiple historians
and considerable finesse. Ideally, teachers, siblings, parents,
and neighbors will contribute. Whether the nature of the assault

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00189&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Cognitive</i>


Is the adolescent intellectually capable of understanding the
nature of his or her behavior and its consequences? In cases of
mental retardation or borderline intellectual functioning, such
factors necessarily guide treatment decisions. Adolescents with
histories of abuse (including prenatal drug exposure and childhood
head injuries) frequently do not achieve their academic
potential and may be misperceived. Intellectual testing may be
necessary to establish cognitive limitations.


<i>Development</i>


Is the adolescent functioning at or below an age-appropriate level
for problem solving? Problems with self-management, impulse
control, social skills, and anger management are frequently noted
among children with abuse histories. Does the behavior reflect
prolonged parent-child separations, social isolation, or early
deprivation that may impede secure attachment? Does the assaultive
behavior reflect a long-standing history of antisocial behavior
or a recent development? An early onset of antisocial behavior
generally indicates a worse prognosis, especially among adolescent
males.


<i>Environment</i>


Has the adolescent been exposed to violence (against himself or
herself or within the family) to such an extent that violence is
perceived as an acceptable means of expressing frustration or
resolving problems? Relevant histories include exposure to multiple
types of violence and exposure to parental substance abuse
or criminality. Who are their role models? What behavioral
norms do they admire? Ideally, multiple sources of information
apply to such an assessment, including family members, neighbors,
medical records, and academic and community resources.

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00190&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

?INITIAL ASSESSMENT: PHYSICAL ABUSE


Open-ended questions such as "What happens in your home
when there is disagreement?" and "What do you consider the
most difficult situation you've ever experienced, and who or what
helped you to cope?" may elicit adolescent perspectives on family
and environmental norms. Questions of exposure to neighborhood
violence and media depictions of violence are also pertinent.
Parents', siblings', and peers' views on the adolescent's
history of responding to threats or difficulties are typically informative.


In cases of juvenile sexual assaults, adolescents should also be
assessed for prior sexual trauma. Sexual assault offenders of all
ages are substantially more likely to have physical or sexual abuse
histories.


? <i>Psychological</i>


Does the adolescent manifest symptoms of psychopathology? If
so, does this influence his or her culpability for the assaultive
behavior? The diagnoses most frequently involved include conduct
disorders, reactive attachment disorders, depression, intermittent
explosive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance
abuse (especially of cocaine and steroids), and psychotic
disorders including schizophrenia.


In any case involving assaultive adolescent behavior, a comprehensive
mental health assessment is indicated to establish the
presence of suicidal, homicidal, or psychotic features. Such factors
necessarily need consideration in terms of how an adolescent
may be expected to respond to various stressors and in terms of
treatment planning.


? <i>Conclusion</i>


Because assaultive adolescent behavior frequently reflects severe
problems with early origins, the sooner such children are recognized
and helped, the better the outcome. By adolescence, these
children typically are a very troubled and troubling population

A suspicion of child sexual abuse usually arises in one of the
following ways, and the approach to investigation may be
slightly different in each case:
<table>

<p>
1. A child has made a statement that he or she has experienced
some type of sexual contact with an adult or another child.

behaviors that raise the suspicion of abuse or has noticed
physical findings, such as redness of the genital or anal area,
complaints of pain, or blood or discharge on the child's
underclothes.

3. A health care provider has discovered evidence of an infection
that may have been sexually transmitted or has found
something that he or she thinks is abnormal on the examination.

? <i>What You Need to Ask to Help Determine
Whether or Not Abuse Has Occurred</i>


The following questions should be asked when attempting to
determine whether abuse has occurred:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Who is reporting that the child has said something? Beware
of separated or divorced parents who are accusing one
another or angry grandparents who want custody.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Who is reporting suspicious physical findings? If the report
is from a health care provider who notices signs of possible
infection or injury, is this person experienced in examining
young children's genitalia? Medical providers who do not
routinely examine the genitalia of young children may not
be aware that there are many normal findings for the
appearance of the genitalia and anus. Has the medical
provider checked his or her impressions with someone else
in the community who is an expert in evaluating possible
sexual abuse? Is the provider aware of conditions that may
be mistaken for abuse? (see Table 37.1).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. What exactly did the child say? Beware of young children
using terms that are too sophisticated for their level of
development. A 3-year-old, for example, would be unlikely
to describe sexual touching as "My dad has been sexually
molesting me" but rather would probably say something
such as "Dad hurts my pee-pee." Can the child give details
as to place, time, and what may have been said by the alleged
abuser? (Refer to the section on interviewing.)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
4. When did the child make a statement, start showing behaviors,
or develop the symptoms that are causing concern?
What else was occurring in the child's life at the time? Had
someone been repeatedly asking the child if he or she had
been abused? Was it a spontaneous remark? Was the child
being treated for any type of medical condition that might

cause genital or anal irritation? Has the child been exposed
to X-rated movies or videos or witness to adult sexual
activity that led to sexualized acting out behavior?

5. Where does the child say that the alleged molestation took
place? Does it make sense that molestation could have
occurred in that setting? Is it possible that the child is
describing genital touching that was not of a sexual nature,
such as cleansing or application of medication?


? <i>Putting All the Information Together</i>


A spontaneous, clear, detailed, and consistent statement from a
child that describes sexual abuse in terms appropriate to that
child's developmental level is the best evidence that abuse has
occurred. If information on specific behavior changes and examination
and laboratory findings are also available, it is helpful to
use a system to integrate all the information.


Too much emphasis has been placed on the medical examination
findings of children who describe being sexually molested.
Most kinds of touching leave no signs. Genital touching, genital
rubbing, oral genital contact, rubbing of the anal area, or even
having objects inserted into the anus usually cause no injury, and
a perfectly normal examination is to be expected. Nonspecific
findings, such as redness of the genital or anal area or discharge
from the vagina, can also be caused by many other conditions
besides sexual abuse and should not be overinterpreted. If the
suspicion of abuse is based solely on a medical provider's examination
findings, it is highly recommended that a second opinion
be sought by a specialist in child sexual abuse medical evaluation
as soon as possible.


A two-part system for classifying genital findings and determining
the overall likelihood of sexual abuse has been published
(Adams, 1997). An abbreviated form of this classification system
is shown in Table 37.1.

When investigating an allegation of sexual abuse, it is
important to recognize that younger children are limited
in their ability to describe and effectively verbalize
the conduct at issue. Although factors other than age (intelligence,
disabilities, and social and language skills) may affect a
child's ability to recall and describe, generally children within a
particular age range will possess similar abilities and limitations.
Being alert to developmental status assists in understanding and
evaluating the child's account. In evaluating reports from children
of all ages, it is important to consider if the language used
to describe the conduct is consistent with the child's age and social
skills. The following general guidelines may be helpful:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Ages infant to 4 years:</i> Generally in this age range, an
investigator must rely on medical evidence, information
provided by caregivers, and any reported symptoms
of trauma because children in the first 4 years of
life make simple verbal allegations. Sleep problems,
nightmares, and acting out a sexual act are common
symptoms. Children 4 years old and younger rarely are
</p><p>[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
qualified in court because at this developmental stage
they are unable to verbalize their understanding of the
difference between a lie and the truth, which is a
requirement for being allowed to testify. Memories of
trauma are recalled in single incidents, like a snapshot
rather than a videotape. Young children are much more
likely to respond to an abuser's attempts to convince
them that sexual abuse is a game or normal. Although
able to identify a familiar person, if an abuser is not a
regular part of a young child's life, he or she rarely can
describe or identify the abuser in person or by photo.
Before age 4, children generally cannot use anatomically
correct dolls to demonstrate what happened to
them; instead, they show what happened by using their
own bodies.

<i>Ages 5 to 7:</i> Because of improved language and memory
skills, children of this age are usually able to describe
sexual abuse; because they lack sexual knowledge and
adult vocabulary, however, their descriptions are often
simplistic. Children younger than 8 years of age usually
remember traumatic events as a single incident and
may illustrate the event by drawing without being
directly aware of doing so (such as in school). Although
possessing a memory as good as that of an adult,
children do not have memory cues to help them retrieve
their memory. Interviewers who use questions
that facilitate memory retrieval obtain more detailed
information (e.g., "Did anything happen to your head?
Your eyes? Your nose? Your mouth? Did anything
happen in the living room? The bedroom? The bathroom?").
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_143121');">[note]</a><div id="_note_143121" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. Because a variety of questions are asked that can elicit a "yes" or "no"
response, this is not likely to suggest a particular response and, therefore, not
an inappropriate leading question.</div>
In this age range, sexual abuse often causes
sleep difficulties, nightmares, and sexual acting out in
play or interactions with other children.


<i>Ages 8 to 11:</i> Referrals in this age range are primarily by
females, perhaps because of a reluctance of males to
reveal sexual abuse. Sexually abused females in this age
range may begin puberty prematurely. Memory and
language have improved; therefore, allegations of sexual
abuse may be clear and specific. Older children may
blame themselves for being sexually abused. By age 8,
children are gaining the skills to access sexual material

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Ages 12 to 16:</i> Males at this age are even more reluctant to
reveal male-to-male abuse. Females may be embarrassed
or resist disclosure because they believe themselves
mature enough to be sexually active. Young
adolescent girls may not understand that seduction by
a much older male is abuse. Language skills and memory
are excellent; therefore, allegations can be clear
and specific. A pattern of having sex with multiple
partners may have begun as a result of being sexually
abused. For abused teens, depression, withdrawal, and
suicide attempts are frequent.


<i>Learning disabled, developmentally delayed, and retarded
children:</i> A child with a disability is especially at risk of
being sexually abused because his or her body is more
mature than his or her emotional or social functioning,
which makes the child easier to manipulate. Before
questioning a disabled child, having his or her teacher
explain the child's disability and functioning level can
be helpful.

It has been well documented that sexually abused children
exhibit significantly higher rates of age-inappropriate and
abusive sexual behaviors compared to nonabused children in
the general population. Furthermore, although sexually abused
children share many of the same psychological problems exhibited
by other emotionally troubled children, problematic sexual
behavior seems to distinguish sexually abused children from
psychiatrically disturbed children who have not been sexually
abused. Thus, when children engage in age-inappropriate or
abusive sexual behaviors or both, a possible history of child sexual
abuse should be considered.


It is important to recognize, however, that many sexual
behaviors exhibited by children are neither age inappropriate or
abusive. In fact, sexual behaviors of various forms are exhibited
by children of all ages.


? <i>What Kinds of Sexual Behaviors May Be
Considered Normative in Young Children?</i>


Recent research has documented that many sexualized behaviors,
including walking around in underwear, scratching one's crotch,

? <i>What Kinds of Sexual Behaviors May
Be Considered Age Inappropriate or
Abusive When Exhibited by Children?</i>


When a child exhibits sexual behavior or knowledge or both that
seems to be beyond that typical for children of his or her age
group, additional exploration is warranted. Age-inappropriate
sexual behaviors may best be described as imitations of adult-like
sexual behaviors, including oral genital contact, inserting objects
in the vagina or anus, imitating intercourse, and asking to engage
in sex acts. In addition, there is cause for concern when children
engage one another in adult-like sexual interactions, particularly
when there are significant differences in the children's ages, either
child uses any type of coercion or force, or both.


? <i>How Can Sexual Behaviors in
Children Be Assessed Most Effectively?</i>


Age-inappropriate sexual behaviors may sometimes be observed
directly by child protection workers. If this occurs, it may be
useful to question the child at that time in as calm and as
nonjudgmental a manner as possible about where they learned
the sexual behaviors. Direct observation of these behaviors by
professionals, however, may be rare because sexually inappropriate
behaviors in children are low base-rate behaviors. Thus, in
assessing sexualized behaviors in children, child protection workers

? <i>What Are Other Reasons Children May Exhibit
Age-Inappropriate or Abusive Sexual Behaviors?</i>


When children exhibit age-inappropriate or abusive sexual behaviors,
the possibility that they have been sexually abused should
be carefully investigated. In the context of a comprehensive
investigation, child sexual abuse, exposure to other forms of
violence, and other alternative explanations for sexual behavior
problems should be considered. Alternative explanations include
but are not limited to the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Lack of understanding of societal norms (e.g. sexually impulsive
behavior exhibited by a mentally retarded adolescent
who has limited understanding of social inhibitions)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Sexual curiosity, exploration, or both beyond what may be
considered normative among age mates who have no known
history of abuse
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Exposure to adult sexual activity, viewing of explicit sexual
behavior on television or in movies, or viewing of pornography
</p>
</td></tr>

history of abuse


3. Exposure to adult sexual activity, viewing of explicit sexual
behavior on television or in movies, or viewing of pornography


It is possible for this type of exposure to occur accidentally
when a child is inadvertently exposed to the sexual activity of
parents, an older sibling, teenage baby-sitters, and so on. Such
exposure may also occur as a result of parental negligence or
extremely relaxed moral standards. Note, however, that exposure
to explicit sexual materials may also occur when sex offenders

Finally, there generally tends to be greater cause for concern
when children's sexual behavior problems have been observed in
different settings, by different caregivers, and seem to be unresponsive
to limit setting. Ultimately, whether a child's age-inappropriate
sexualized behaviors are reflective of an abuse history
will be determined by a comprehensive investigation that includes
forensic interviews, medical examination, and the collection of
collateral information.


? <i>What Kind of Treatment Should Be
Recommended for Children Who Exhibit
Age-Inappropriate Sexual Behavior?</i>


For psychiatric and child protection purposes, it is important to
determine the etiology of age-inappropriate sexual behaviors
exhibited by children. Regardless of the etiology, however, children
exhibiting sexual behavior problems should receive specialized
treatment for such behaviors. This is important because such
behaviors generally do not disappear on their own, and they may
increase a child's risk of being sexually victimized or engaging in
sexual offenses in the future or both. Furthermore, preliminary
research evidence suggests that age-inappropriate sexual behaviors
may be most effectively treated when nonoffending parents
are involved in treatment and when they obtain some training in
behavior management. Thus, children exhibiting such difficulties
with or without an identified history of child sexual abuse should
be referred to counselors with specialized expertise in this area.

Many experts recommend that all children believed to have been
sexually abused should have a medical evaluation.


• The abuse involved the child's genitalia or anus


• The child has symptoms of vaginal or rectal pain, itching,
burning, bleeding, or discharge


• The child or parent has concerns that can best be answered
by a physician or nurse


• The child would be reassured by an examination


• The extent or type of abuse is unclear and may be clarified
by an examination


The following are indications for an emergent (immediate) or
urgent (same-day) evaluation:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• The child should be seen as soon as possible if the abuse
occurred within the past 72 hours and included sexual
activities that may have left forensic material on the
victim's clothing or body. Forensic material includes semen,
saliva, blood, skin or hair of the perpetrator, and
fibers or material from the crime scene. Examples of
sexual activity that may leave forensic evidence include
ejaculation, contact with the perpetrator's genitalia, licking,
bleeding, biting, scratching, or other similar acts
within the prior 72 hours. The likelihood of recovering
forensic material decreases with passing time. The child
should not bathe or change clothing prior to the examination.

The following are indications for an evaluation within a few
days:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• The child has less serious symptoms, such as discharge,
pain with urination, and itching.
</p>
</td></tr>

stress, or other reasons.
</p>
</td></tr>

</table>
An evaluation within a few weeks is indicated in all other
circumstances.


• The child has less serious symptoms, such as discharge,
pain with urination, and itching.


• The child or family is unwilling to wait because of anxiety,
stress, or other reasons.


• The child could be pregnant as a result of the abuse.


? <i>Seek a Medical Examiner Who Has
Been Trained in Sexual Abuse Evaluations</i>


In most situations, an examiner who has specific training in sexual
abuse will provide a more complete and accurate evaluation
compared to an examiner without such training. Clinics or other
practices that specialize in child abuse evaluations are preferable
to emergency departments or general practitioners. Urgent evaluations
for forensic evidence collection or serious symptoms may
require the use of an emergency department.


? <i>Prepare the Child for the
Medical Evaluation</i>


Explain the evaluation process to the child and reassure him or
her that the evaluation should not be painful. The evaluation for
most children will include a medical history, a short general
physical examination, and an external inspection of the genitalia
and anus. It is highly unusual for a preadolescent child to require
an internal vaginal or rectal examination. Explain to the nonoffending
caregiver that the examination is different and less
invasive than an adult pelvic examination. This preparation
should reduce the child's and caregiver's anxiety and will contribute
to a more comfortable and informative examination.

? <i>Provide the Examiner With
Helpful Information</i>


To avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful and repetitive
questioning of the child, a detailed history should be provided to
the examiner prior to the evaluation.


? <i>Questions That May Be Asked
During the Medical Evaluation</i>


The child, the parent, or both will be asked questions about the
child's current health, past medical history, medications, recent
behavior changes and any current complaints or symptoms,
information about possible earlier trauma or abuse involving the
anogenital area, other problems in this area, and possible sexual
activity. Questions about the alleged abuse may also be asked if a
forensic interview of the child has not been performed or if the
examiner was not given the history of the alleged abuse. In some
cases, the examiner may need to ask the child specific questions
about the abuse when the information is needed to determine the
need for medical testing and treatment.

include the following:

<i>Definition:</i> Infectious diseases that are transmitted through sexual
contact are referred to as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).


<i>Prevalence of STDs in sexually abused children:</i> Abuse victims are
more likely to have an STD if they were abused by multiple
perpetrators, abused multiple times, live in a community with a
high prevalence of STDs, or were abused by a perpetrator who
had high-risk behaviors. High-risk behaviors include intravenous
drug use, crack use, prostitution, or multiple sexual partners. In
addition, sexually active adolescents have the highest rates of
STDs of all age groups. Relatively few abused children have an
STD, however (usually less than 5%).


<i>Sexual transmission and nonsexual transmission:</i> Some STDs are
caused by microorganisms that live exclusively in, or near, the
genitalia or rectum of an infected person. These STDs are almost
always transmitted through sexual contact. Other microorganisms,
in addition to living in or near the genitalia or rectum, also
live in nonsexual areas of the body. Infections by these microorganisms
can be transmitted by sexual or nonsexual contact.
Appendix 3, Table A3.1 summarizes the likelihood of sexual
transmission of specific STDs.

[p. <i>194</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00214&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Certain STDs are transmitted to children in the perinatal
period, during or before birth. A physician can differentiate most
perinatal infections from infections due to sexual abuse. Some
infections, such as those from chlamydia or warts, are more
difficult to differentiate. Appendix 3, Table A3.2 lists specifics
about perinatal infection.


<i>Symptoms of STDs:</i> The symptoms and illnesses caused by STDs
vary depending on the specific infection, the age of the child or
adolescent, and the site of the infection. Adolescent girls are often
asymptomatic (without symptoms). Appendix 3, Table A3.2 describes
the most common manifestations of STDs.


<i>Which children should be tested for STDs?</i> The majority of abuse
victims will not have an STD. Because many STDs cause no
symptoms, however, tests are often done during the medical
evaluation to exclude a silent infection. Some examiners will test
all alleged victims for STDs, whereas others limit testing to those
whom they believe are at increased risk for infection, such as
those with

<i>Testing the alleged perpetrator for STDs:</i> If the sexual abuse victim
has been diagnosed with an STD, the alleged perpetrator should
be tested to determine if he or she also has the infection. Interpret
this information cautiously. If the alleged perpetrator has already
received treatment, the tests may be negative. If the tests are
positive, the information will support the allegations of sexual
abuse, although a definite connection linking the alleged perpetrator
to the victim cannot be made. Tests for HIV, syphilis, and
hepatitis will always be positive, even after the alleged perpetrator
has received medical treatment.


<i>Tests used to diagnose STDs:</i> In cases of suspected sexual abuse
or assault, it is critical that the tests used to diagnose STDs are
recognized as "gold standards." Only those tests listed in Appendix
3, Table A3. 2 should be used.


<i>Treatment of STDs:</i> In all cases of alleged abuse, appropriate
diagnostic tests must be obtained before treatment is given.
Treatment may be given, however, before a definitive diagnosis
is made. In other situations, no presumptive treatment should be
given.


• Prepubertal children without symptoms should not be
treated unless an STD is diagnosed using a gold standard.


• Adolescents have a greater risk of infection and complications.
Presumptive treatment may be indicated.


• A physician should evaluate within 72 hours any victim
who has been assaulted by an HIV-positive perpetrator to
ascertain whether HIV prophylaxis is indicated.


• Hepatitis B vaccination should be provided to all victims
who are not already immunized.

? <i>General Principles</i>


<i>Normal examinations are common after sexual abuse</i>. Most
children who have been sexually abused will have normal physical
examinations, including children who report vaginal or anal
penetration. The finding of a normal examination does not mean
the child was not abused.


<i>Facts about the hymen:</i>

<i>The examiner is searching for physical changes that may be the
result of sexual abuse</i>. Injuries to the genitalia and anus may occur
during sexual abuse. Chronic (old) sexual abuse may cause
changes different from acute (recent) abuse. Sexual abuse may
transmit sexually transmitted diseases (see Chapter 41, this volume).


<i>Puberty changes the appearance and size of the genitalia as well
as the examiner's ability to diagnose injury</i>. Enlargement of the
vaginal opening and redundancy (folds) of the hymen can prevent
injuries from vaginal penetration or make them more difficult to
recognize.


<i>Superficial genital and anal injuries often heal quickly</i>. If there is
a delay between the time of the abuse and the examination, minor
trauma that may have resulted from the abuse will no longer be
present. The amount of time needed for an injury to heal varies.
Deeper injuries require more time to heal, as do injuries that are
not able to heal because of reinjury.


<i>Tanner staging:</i> The stages of puberty can be described with the
Tanner Scale. Tanner Stage I describes the genitalia prior to the
onset of puberty. Tanner Stage V describes the genitalia after
puberty is complete. Stages II, III, and IV are intermediate stages.


<i>Clock references in the sexual abuse reports:</i> Many examiners
refer to locations near the genitalia and anus using a "clock face"
analogy. Therefore, the top-center location is referred to as "12
o'clock," "3 o'clock" refers to the area 90 degrees to the right of
12 o'clock, and so on.

• <i>Vagina:</i> a tubular structure inside the body, bordered by the
hymen at the outer end and by the cervix internally


• <i>Posterior fourchette:</i> the area of mucosal skin at which the labia
minora meet (opposite end to the clitoris)


• <i>Fossa navicularis:</i> the area of mucosal skin between the posterior
fourchette and the hymen

? <i>Interpretation of Normal and
Nonspecific Examinations</i>


Most children who have been sexually abused have normal or
nonspecific physical examinations. Some of these normal and
nonspecific findings are described in the following sections.
These findings are clearly not proof of sexual abuse but may be
present in children who have been abused.


<i><b>Normal or Nonspecific Prepubertal
Female Genital Findings</b></i>


• <i>Bumps, tags, or mounds:</i> small protrusions on the hymenal
edge


• <i>Clefts:</i> interruptions of the normally smooth hymenal edge

? They are most commonly found along the midhorizontal
plane of the hymen at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions.
When present below this horizontal line, they may indicate
healed injury.


• <i>Redness, vaginitis, and discharge:</i> can be due to poor hygiene,
infection, bubble bath, and other causes


• <i>Intravaginal ridges or columns:</i> normal folds of the vaginal wall


• <i>Periurethral bands:</i> support-like bands of tissue radiating from
the urethral meatus


• <i>Increased vascularity of vestibule or hymen:</i> more than the
usual number of blood vessels within these tissues


• <i>Posterior fourchette friability:</i> tendency of the posterior
fourchette mucosa to bleed easily

present. No conclusion regarding sexual abuse should be
made based on the size of the vaginal opening alone.


<i>Normal or Nonspecific Pubertal
Female Genital Findings</i>


• <i>Redundant, fimbriated hymen:</i> During puberty, the hymenal
tissue becomes thicker and redundant (folded), the opening
into the vagina becomes larger, and the hymenal tissue becomes
more elastic and less sensitive to touch. The mucous covering
the vaginal walls becomes less prone to injury from abrasion.
Folds in the hymen make examination difficult, and distinguishing
folds from injury can be challenging.


• <i>Vaginal discharge:</i> Although discharge can be normal, it may
also indicate infection.


<b>
<i>Normal or Nonspecific Anal Findings</i>
</b>


• <i>Fissures, excoriation, redness:</i> may be seen after sexual abuse
but there are other causes


• <i>Anal tags:</i> protrusion of tissue at the 6 o'clock or 12 o'clock
midline positions


• <i>Diastasis ani:</i> smooth anal skin at the 6 o'clock or 12 o'clock
midline positions


• <i>Increased skin pigmentation and thickened anal skin folds</i>


• <i>Venous congestion:</i> pooling of blood in the veins around the
anus


• <i>Gaping (wide open) anus:</i> only normal if stool is present in the
distal (end) anus

? <i>Interpretation of Abnormal
Examinations That Reveal Trauma</i>


Trauma may or may not indicate sexual abuse. Some types of
trauma are nonspecific, whereas others indicate that sexual abuse
has most likely occurred.


<b>
<i>Prepubertal Female Genital Trauma</i>
</b>


• Acute injuries to the genitalia cause bruising, lacerations (tears),
abrasions (scrapes), and inflammation (redness, tenderness,
and swelling): Most of these injuries heal quickly without
leaving any lasting signs to be found on later examination.
Acute genital injuries are always suspicious for sexual abuse,
particularly when the trauma includes the hymen. Accidental
trauma usually involves the labia or the mons pubis or both.


• Findings that indicate healed vaginal penetration: Note that
the legal definition of <i>penetration</i> may include contact with the
external genital structures, such as the labia, posterior
fourchette, and fossa navicularis. <i>Vaginal penetration</i> in this
chapter refers to internal, vaginal penetration.


? Absent or significant defect of the posterior hymen (should
be confirmed by examining the child in the knee-chest
position):

<b>
<i>Female Pubertal Genital Trauma</i>

Signs of vaginal penetration can be more difficult to recognize,
or may be absent, in the adolescent. New hymenal tears and signs
of acute injury are indications of recent vaginal penetration.
Transections (complete interruptions or breaks) in the hymen are

<b>
<i>Male Genital Trauma</i>
</b>


Findings that indicate recent injury include swelling, abrasions,
bruises, lacerations, and bites. Acute injury is always suspicious
for sexual abuse.


<b>
<i>Anal Trauma</i>
</b>


• Findings of acute anal injury include bruising, lacerations,
abrasions, and swelling. Most of these injuries heal without
leaving any lasting signs. Acute injury is always suspicious for
sexual abuse.


• Scars may result from deep lacerations after sexual abuse and
will be visible long after the abuse occurred. Skin tags away
from the midline of the anus may indicate healed injuries.


• Chronic sexual abuse may result in funneling (loss of subcutaneous
fat around the anus), changes in the anal skin, and
decreased sphincter muscle tone. Decreased tone is defined as
&gt;20 mm of anal dilation with no stool in the distal anus.


<b>
<i>Trauma Outside the Genital and Anal Areas</i>
</b>


Injuries to a child's breasts, throat, mouth, or other areas may
occur following sexual abuse. Specific injuries from oral gags or
binding of the extremities may be found.

experience to be able to differentiate between full vaginal
penetration and attempted or partial penetration, her impression
may be that she was penetrated. If pressure is
exerted against the hymen, most girls will experience pain.

Young girls who have started their menstrual periods are
considered to be adolescents, even if they are younger than
age 13. In addition to needing an examination to search
for signs of injury, evidence of sperm or semen, and signs of
sexually transmitted disease, adolescent girls suspected of having
been sexually abused must also be screened for pregnancy.


When a girl has gone through puberty, her genital tissues
change. The hymen becomes thicker and much more elastic, with
folds and flaps of tissue that allow the hymen to be stretched out
without tearing. It is common for an adolescent girl who has had
sexual intercourse to have a perfectly normal hymen. The idea
that the hymen always tears with intercourse is a myth.


? <i>When Is an Examination Necessary?</i>


An adolescent who reveals that she has been the victim of incest
or forced sexual contact with someone other than a family
member should always be asked to describe when the last sexual
contact occurred. The urgency of obtaining an examination will
depend on her answer. If the victim describes ejaculation, the

[p. <i>207</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00227&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I004&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

If the victim describes pain in the genital or rectal area, or
bleeding from the vagina or rectum, the examination must also
be done immediately. Signs of sexually transmitted diseases can
be seen as early as 3 days after a sexual contact (gonorrhea) and
as late as 1 or 2 years (genital warts). If tests are done for syphilis
or HIV, these must be repeated in 6 months because it can take
this amount of time for the infection to be detected with a blood
test.


If the sexual assault involved touching only, oral genital
contact, or intercourse with lubrication or drugging of the victim,
it is very unlikely that any signs of injury will be found. Table 43.1
provides guidelines for when the examination should be done
and what tests or treatment might be given.


? <i>Other Factors in Obtaining the History</i>


In addition to determining when the assault occurred and
whether the victim is experiencing pain, bleeding, or discharge
from the vagina, it is also necessary to determine whether an
adolescent girl has previously had intercourse. If she has previously
had sex, any "chronic" changes found on examination
could have been caused by past abuse or by consensual sex. If a
sexually transmitted infection is found, and the sexual assault was
within 2 days of the examination, the infection was not caused
by the assault but, rather, was already present from a previous
contact.

[p. <i>208</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00228&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Adolescent girls have many different reactions to sexual assault
and may not appear to be as upset as the interviewer might
think they should be. Denial of feelings is very common among
adolescents, and it may be days, weeks, months, or even years
before the full impact of the sexual abuse is felt by the teenage
girl. The criteria for judging the validity of an adolescent girl's
description of sexual abuse are the same as those for a younger
child: Is it a clear, consistent, detailed description? Did the history
come out spontaneously? Are there changes in the girl's emotional
state and behavior that may have started near the time the
abuse is said to have begun?


? <i>Overall Assessment</i>


After the child's statement and past medical and sexual history
have been obtained, the examination has been conducted, and all
the laboratory results have been received, the information can be
used to develop an overall assessment of the likelihood of abuse.
Table 37.1 (Chapter 37, this volume) offers an approach to
integrating all the information. Often, unless the victim describes
pain or bleeding from the sexual assault, the girl's examination
will show few or no signs of injury. The history from the teen of
what occurred is the most important evidence of abuse; this
applies to adolescents and to younger children.

This chapter briefly reviews what is viewed as normal or
expected sexual behavior in children and when sexual play
between children becomes problematic and requires intervention.
Note that in some families any sexual behavior, such as
masturbation, may be seen as problematic or unacceptable, even
though the behavior is generally viewed as normal.


? <i>Normal, Expected Sexual Play in Children</i>


Normal sexual play includes behaviors such as playing doctor,
playing house, imitating intercourse clothed, looking at or briefly
touching other children's genitals, sexual talk and jokes, sexual
games, and masturbation. Normal sexual behavior

is within normal limits and can be controlled through appropriate
adult supervision.

inappropriate for children; and behaviors that continue to occur
after adult intervention to stop the behavior. Problematic sexual

When should these children be referred for additional evaluation?
When children show problematic sexual behavior, it is
recommended that they be referred to a mental health professional
who has experience with sexual behavior problems in
children for an assessment and possible treatment for the child
and caregivers.


The following factors may be related to problematic sexual
behavior in children:

"Good for you! You followed the sexual behavior rules
today").


• Eliminate sexually stimulating television, videos, and exposure
to adult sexual activity.


• Do not allow children to bathe or sleep with other
children or adults.


• Do not allow nudity in the home.


• Distract children with other activities, such as puzzles,
games, or drawing.


• Give children appropriate affection.


• Increase children's physical activities, such as riding bikes,
shooting baskets, jumping rope, or skating.

? <i>Assessment of Psychological Maltreatment</i>


Psychological maltreatment is identified through observations
and reports of caregiver behavior. Knowledge of the forms of
psychological maltreatment described in Chapter 6 (this volume)
and their embodiment in state or provincial law provide guidance
in identifying psychologically abusive caregiver behaviors (see
Table 6.1).


<b>
<i>Caregiver Behavior</i>
</b>


If possible, a professional should observe the caregiver suspected
of psychological maltreatment and child interacting. Observations
should be done on several occasions to obtain a
representative sample of caregiver-child behavior and to detect
chronic behavioral patterns. Psychologically maltreating parents
may be continually critical and derogatory, threaten to abandon
their child (e.g., "Do that once more and it's foster care"), place
age-inappropriate demands on their child (e.g., telling a 2-year-old
to go into the kitchen and get cigarettes and matches for a
guest), or ignore a crying, frightened, or upset child. Single
observations have limitations because some parents may not

[p. <i>216</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00236&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The professional should know his or her state's statutory
requirements for reporting psychological maltreatment. Some
states with a lower threshold may require only documentation of
psychological maltreatment. Other states also require evidence of
mental harm, including observation rating forms, extensive review
of other professionals' contacts with the child and family
(e.g., school, day care, and health personnel), and a psychological
evaluation.


<b>
<i>Child Behavior</i>
</b>


Child behavior can suggest that psychological maltreatment
has occurred. Psychologically maltreated children may act afraid
or wary of, angry with, or largely ignore their caregiver, whereas
adequately reared children are often comfortable and confident
in their caregiver's presence. A child's behavior alone, however,
is not sufficient to substantiate a case. Mental injuries in children
may be caused by many factors, such as mental illness, mental
retardation and autism, and psychological trauma that is unrelated
to caregiver behavior. Children with these problems, however,
can also be psychologically maltreated. Ruling out other
explanations for problematic behavior may be done by knowledgeable
caseworkers who are familiar with adequately cared for
children with mental illnesses, developmental delays, and trauma.


How do you identify mental injuries in children and adolescents?
Meeting criteria for "severe emotional disturbance" as
defined under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act (34 Code of Federal Regulations 300.7) or a mental disorder
in the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</i> (<i>DSM-IV;</i> APA, 1994)
meets the definition of mental injury in most states. Severe
emotional disturbance is a condition in which a child exhibits one
or more of the following symptoms during a period of time that

[p. <i>217</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00237&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>
<i>Level of Severity</i>
</b>


To determine the level of severity of the psychological maltreatment,
the following useful guidelines can be used: (a) How
intense, extreme, and chronic is the behavior? (b) To what extent
is the child-caregiver relationship permeated by the maltreatment?
(c) How many forms of psychological maltreatment are
occurring? (d) Are there other people in a child's life that buffer
the effects of the psychological maltreatment? (For example, a
close relationship with the father may protect a child from a
verbally abusive mother.) (e) What is the importance of appropriate
caregiver behavior in relation to the child's developmental
needs? (For example, a caregiver who interacts with an infant
only to feed or change diapers, ignoring needs for interaction and
warmth, places the child at significant developmental risk.) (f) To
what extent is there probable evidence that the child has been
harmed by the caregiver? For example, a marked lack of interest
in the world may be probable evidence of harm because depressed,
passive behavior is often seen in emotionally neglected
infants and very infrequently in other infants. Continuation of
this pattern of behavior will inhibit emotional and cognitive
development.


Finally, evaluators should consider a family's community
context and its economic, social, and cultural circumstances when
assessing caregiver behavior. Parents do not always have control
over adverse conditions that may be influencing their ability to
parent and their child's ability to cope. For example, homelessness
and living in a poor, violent neighborhood will likely have
an adverse impact on both quality of care and child development

? <i>Questions to Ask Caregivers, Neighbors,
Relatives, and Older Children</i>

relatives, and older children:

Psychological maltreatment is a term with various legal
definitions. All children who witness domestic violence are
affected by it but not to a level that constitutes psychological
maltreatment. The effects of witnessing domestic violence are
not clearly correlated with the frequency, intensity, severity, and
duration of the violence; instead, the effects of witnessing violence
are assessed by the extent to which the child suffers from
witnessing it. Research suggests that the following factors influence
the degree to which witnessing violence affects children:


<i>The child's age</i>. A general rule of thumb is that the earlier the child
witnesses domestic violence, the more severe the effects are likely
to be. An atmosphere of domestic violence early in life can harm
the child's capacity for attachment. The mother's endangered
availability may affect the child's social bonding for a lifetime.
Age 8 has been identified as a watershed year for the harmful
effects of witnessing domestic violence. Children younger than
age 8 experience developmentally appropriate egocentricity.
They feel culpable when their parents fight--as if the fighting was

[p. <i>221</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00241&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>The child's developmental stage</i>. Closely related to age, the effect
of witnessing domestic violence will vary depending on the
child's stage of development. It is known that when children
expend energy to defend themselves from the experience of
trauma, their development can be distorted or delayed. Learn
about the child's developmental stage when the witnessing of
domestic violence began, and consider the child's current stage
of development. Are there delays apparent? Does the child show
signs of difficulty, such as global mistrust, chronic shame, or
crippling guilt that may reflect harm from having been exposed
to domestic violence earlier in development?


<i>The child's gender</i>. Males are much more likely to identify with
the aggressor. That is, they reduce the distress of watching a
batterer hit the victim by seeing how useful hitting can be or by
identifying the reasons for hitting. They are likely to become
violent toward others, particularly those of the same sex as that
of the victim. Males typically externalize the effects of witnessing
violence into verbal and physical explosiveness, defiance and
oppositional behaviors, and delinquent acts. They try to gain
control of an unpredictable world through provocation. Females
are more likely to be socialized into a passive role to "keep the
peace." They are likely to internalize the effects of witnessing
violence. Depression, withdrawal, and other psychological or
physical symptoms can result. They try to control a dangerous
world through compulsive caretaking. These effects are not as
clear-cut along gender lines as they once were.

[p. <i>222</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00242&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>The child's role in the family</i>. Children in roles that are more
central to the violence, such as scapegoat, caretaker, and peacemaker,
may be harmed more than children whose roles are more
peripheral to violence, such as the hero, the mascot, or the lost
child.


It is important to note that the child's age, developmental
level, gender, and role in the family interact in complex ways to
mediate the effects of witnessing domestic violence. We cannot
assess the possible psychological maltreatment of a child on the
basis of the nature of the violence alone. We must examine the
consequences evidenced in the development and behavior of each
individual child, keeping in mind the four factors that affect the
outcome of witnessing violence.


From research, it is known that violence does breed violence.
Children who are abused and neglected are much more likely to
grow into delinquent teens, adult criminals, or adults with problems
of violence in relationship. Research strongly suggests that
witnessing violence can pose the same risks to children in the
family, which result from being victims of physical abuse or
neglect.


It is critical to be aware of the legal definitions of emotional
maltreatment in your area. Local departments of child and family
services, the police, or parent and child advocacy organizations
will be able to inform you. If you have concerns about something
that might constitute emotional maltreatment, consulting with
screeners at the local child protective services agency can be of
invaluable assistance. The law does not guarantee children optimal
parenting, but it does protect children from extremes of
emotional and psychological torment. When the frequency, intensity,
severity, duration, or all these of domestic violence in the
home produce the type of age-, stage-, gender-, and role-related
problems that you might anticipate in children who witness
domestic violence, then you are likely to be viewing the effects
on vulnerable children of witnessing domestic violence in the
home.

For the purposes of this chapter, <i>risk of child maltreatment</i>
refers to a family situation in which child maltreatment is
likely to occur or recur. <i>Risk assessment</i> is a thorough study
that results in a judgment about the likelihood of child maltreatment.
Many agencies require an assessment of risk at two points
in time: (a) as part of an initial assessment to determine whether
a family is in need of child protective services (CPS) (because a
risk of maltreatment is identified) and (b) to determine whether
CPS intervention can be terminated (because risk factors have
been reduced). The process of risk assessment considers the
family unit, family or other household members, and the relationships
and interactions of the family members. Regardless of
the model used to assess risk, the following information is always
relevant:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• <i>Child maltreatment:</i> This should include a description
and explanation of the events associated with the maltreatment;
physical and emotional manifestations present
in the child; the precise actions and behaviors of the
caregivers believed to be responsible for the maltreatment;
frequency, chronicity, and duration of any maltreatment;
and circumstances such as parental attitude,

• <i>The child:</i> This should include a full consideration of all
the children in a family--age and vulnerability, development,
health, temperament, and functioning (cognitive,
physical, emotional, and social).


• <i>The caregivers:</i> The assessment should consider general
functioning (cognitive, physical, emotional, and social),
mental health status, substance use, life management,
coping and problem-solving capacity, social relationships,
and history of all adults in a caregiving role.


• <i>Parenting:</i> The assessment should identify the relationship
of the caregiver to the child (e.g., parent, relative, and
friend of parent) and focus on understanding methods of
discipline; parenting approaches, attitudes, sensitivity, expectations,
knowledge, and skill; the parent's understanding
of child development; and the nature of the
parent-child relationship (attachment), empathy, and support
of the child.


• <i>Family functioning:</i> The assessment of family functioning
considers how the family unit works internally, how
family members relate and interact, and how the family
interacts with the outside world. Specific issues include
demographics (that could create stress), family structure,
culture, communication, affection, relationships, decision
making, integration into the community, and support
networks.


? <i>The Process of Gathering
Risk Assessment Information</i>


The family is the primary source of information. In accordance
with local confidentiality policies, you may also gather or confirm
information by talking with extended family members, friends,
neighbors, and professionals involved with the family. Most
workers prefer to begin information collection with the child
based on the child's location and the potential need for protection.
Whatever the order of interviewing, remember to demonstrate
respect for the caregivers' authority in the family.

[p. <i>229</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00249&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Your general approach in risk assessment interviews should be
characterized by respect for the family, genuineness, empathy, and
being specific and concrete. A risk assessment interview has a
ripple effect quality. Your entry into the home is like a pebble that
is dropped in the water. You introduce yourself and the agency
and establish the basis for your presence by briefly reviewing the
CPS report. You ask for cooperation to assist you to become
informed about what is happening in the family. The first ripple
occurs when you center your attention on the caregivers and their
feelings and concerns rather than focusing on the report. They
begin to reveal to you who they are and what the family is like.
The second ripple occurs when you meet the child and learn
about the child's functioning and indications of maltreatment.
The third ripple occurs as you inquire about the parents' view
and understanding of their child. Subsequent ripples emerge as
you learn about the adults, how the family operates, parenting,
stresses, strengths, and so on. This is a balanced approach to
collecting information compared to focusing most of your attention
on a maltreatment incident. As the ripples circle out from
where you begin, you will find that returning to address the
reported maltreatment circumstances and events in detail seems
more natural and produces less denial and avoidance.


? <i>The Process of Analyzing
Risk Assessment Information</i>


How do you assess risk? <i>Assessing</i> is assigning weight (significance)
to information. When you analyze the information you
have collected, you should determine what information is significant
by judging the extent to which it contributes to or explains
the risk of maltreatment. The following are practical steps for
assessing risk:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Collect information using risk-related interviews.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Organize information by the categories previously provided.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Determine whether you have sufficient and believable information,
including obtaining collateral information as
needed.

4. Assess. Assign significance to each category of risk factors.
Various models have specific ways to assign significance
(e.g., rating or giving scores and anchoring as low, moderate,
or high). It is important to determine whether something
you know about the family contributes to placing a child at
risk.

5. Draw a conclusion. By grouping significant information into
an overall picture of the family, you produce a meaningful
conclusion about the risk of maltreatment. You illustrate
individual and family functioning, patterns of behavior,
events, interaction, and stresses to establish the rationale for
the likelihood that maltreatment will occur without intervention.
You justify your judgment. This is done by specifically
identifying why you believe the information is
significant.


? <i>Assessing Safety</i>


A child may be unsafe when a family situation involves family
conditions that are out of control, can be expected to occur (be
displayed) immediately, and likely will have severe effects for a
child. A safety assessment refers to the application of a method
to identify the presence of threats to a child's safety within the
family or home. It is important to always be concerned with
safety; a formal safety assessment, however, is necessary at specific
times in the life of a case: (a) receipt of a referral, (b) first contact
with a family, (c) conclusion of the initial assessment, (d) establishment
of the ongoing service plan, (e) case review, and (f) case
closure.


From the definitions, it is clear that risk of maltreatment and
concern for child safety (or threats to child safety) are not the
same. Therefore, two distinct assessment approaches are needed.
Children may be at risk of maltreatment at some point in the
future but be safe from the likelihood of immediate threats of
severe harm. Evaluating safety requires exploration of safety
influences--that is, a risk factor that is operating at a more
intense, explosive, immediate, dangerous, threatening level.
Therefore, all safety influences are risk factors, but not all risk
factors are safety influences.

[p. <i>231</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00251&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

You consider safety when you meet with the family face-to-face.
You also evaluate safety when you conduct assessments or
reviews during the life of the case (e.g., investigation and case
assessment). You should be concerned with safety from two
perspectives: (a) Is the child in danger right now (currently)? and
(b) Might the child be in danger within the near future (next 30
days)?


How do you assess current danger? Search for <i>danger-loaded
influences</i>, which are family situations, behavior, emotions, persons,
physical circumstances, or social contexts operating in
isolation or together in ways that create a current, immediate
(now), and significant threat to a child's safety. These family
conditions are transparent and easily identified. Examples of
danger-loaded influences include hitting and hurting a child in
the present, head and face injuries, premeditated maltreatment,
bizarre cruelty, young children left alone unsupervised, and the
parent being intoxicated or unable to perform parental duties.
Because danger-loaded influences are operating in the present
and because the threat is obvious and imminent, response and
action must be immediate.


To assess child safety related to the next 30 days, a more
complete picture of the family based on your risk assessment is
necessary. Safety influences are specific behaviors (e.g., a parent
is violent), specific emotions (e.g., a parent is too depressed to
care for her child), specific situations (e.g., a family resides in
condemned housing), or specific states of mind (e.g., a parent
perceives the child in extremely negative terms). You assess safety
by observing the family; listening for expressions of concern
about safety; collecting risk-related information; analyzing risk
information to identify safety influences; and qualifying safety
influences by applying the criteria based on control, immediacy,
and severity. Assessing safety is not about establishing proof or
completing an empirically based prediction of what might occur.
Assessing safety is grounded in (a) being well informed; (b) using
prudence, reason, and logic to analyze information; and (c) being
conservatively guided to ensure child safety while being respectful
of parents' rights.


When assessing risk of maltreatment and threats to child
safety, it must be remembered that an assessment tool is only an
adjunct to effective decision making. Furthermore, predicting
future human and family behavior is sufficiently difficult that one

Formal risk assessment is a structured process designed to
ensure consistency with knowledgeable standards and protocols
and to support the worker's decision-making process.
To apply it effectively, we must also understand the potential
impact of our intervention response on diverse children and
family systems. What does it really mean to go beyond a "gut"
instinct to acquire essential knowledge about the level of childhood
vulnerability in families who are fundamentally different
from oneself? How can we truly understand the ways in which
diverse families (a) nurture and protect their children, physically
and emotionally; (b) recognize and prioritize child endangerment
situations and provide protection to avert child injury of any
kind; (c) organize themselves, and others in their family or social
network or larger community, to directly and consistently provide
care for their children; and (d) socialize and discipline their
children, teaching them how to live in the world with other people
and comply with laws and community practices. In an increasingly
mosaic society, how does the worker effectively recognize
the relevancy of innumerable cultural distinctions and the respective
impact on both the worker and the family's perceptions of

[p. <i>234</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00254&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Unquestionably, it is a complicated but unavoidable task to
accommodate cultural considerations when conducting protective
risk assessment. The worker must understand the dynamics
of difference in cultural groups that have experienced systematic
discrimination or extreme environments (e.g., poverty, violence,
oppression, segregation, exploitation, and war). It is equally
important that the worker is mature enough to actively engage in
a continuous journey of professional development, which involves
minimally the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Self-evaluation regarding one's own cultural values and
professional motivation
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Openness to personal scrutiny and the conscious avoidance
of assumptions and stereotyping
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Recognition and management of unconscious biases and
emotional attachment to ignorance and falsehood about
others who are different
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Reliance on an overall healthy personal mental mind-set
and related helping approaches (even when the use of
authority is involved, such as removal of a child from the
parent)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Natural and genuine interest in the unique lifestyles and
worldviews of the families being served, requiring the use
of various resources, to gain enhanced skills in assessing
unacceptable or detrimental outcomes for children or
both
</p>

</table>


• Self-evaluation regarding one's own cultural values and
professional motivation


• Openness to personal scrutiny and the conscious avoidance
of assumptions and stereotyping


• Recognition and management of unconscious biases and
emotional attachment to ignorance and falsehood about
others who are different


• Reliance on an overall healthy personal mental mind-set
and related helping approaches (even when the use of
authority is involved, such as removal of a child from the
parent)


• Natural and genuine interest in the unique lifestyles and
worldviews of the families being served, requiring the use
of various resources, to gain enhanced skills in assessing
unacceptable or detrimental outcomes for children or
both


It is no simple matter to combine cultural self-awareness and
understanding of the cultures of others with the volatile and
urgent child protection agenda. Nevertheless, this balance must
be achieved if the worker intends to enable the family, the
community, and other members of the expanded professional
team to work in partnership to ensure that every child receives a
safe, nurturing, and good enough childhood.

? <i>The Importance of Culture</i>


Child welfare scholars have documented differences in affective,
attitudinal, and behavioral patterns of different groups, noting
that these distinctions can be seen in the varying approaches to
the socialization of children. The worker must remain mindful
of these potential differences while generally working under
severe time constraints and often with a parent or family system
involuntarily involved in the child welfare system. Cultural differences
influence the way in which families interact with outsiders,
cooperate with institutions and authority, perform parenting
functions, and cope with trauma and hardship or success and
accomplishment.


When balancing specific child maltreatment safety and risk
screening activities with the validation of the cultural lens of the
family, the worker's goal is to engage the family so as to gain
essential and accurate information about the child's immediate
status and well-being as well as the family's capacity to appropriately
support the child's critical development (see Chapters 9 and
20, this volume). The scenario that follows typifies the worker's
need to actively integrate the culture factor in this process:
<blockquote>
<p>
Nikki arrived at the emergency room with her 7-year-old twin
daughters. On medical examination, it was determined that
both children had contracted gonorrhea. When the worker
arrived, she easily gained the history from the two shy girls.
For the past 2 years, Nikki had lived with her children and
her boyfriend, who paid all the bills and leased their apartment.
Every Sunday afternoon, he allowed Nikki to shop for
food while he cared for the girls on his only day off from
construction work. During this time, the girls alternated
taking baths and having forced intercourse with the boyfriend.
The children never reported the abuse to their mother
because, as the more assertive child reported, "We called the
police whenever daddy beat up our mommy, but the police
<i>never</i> came!"
</p>
<p>
When Nikki discovered that the children would be removed
on an emergency basis until their safety needs were

ensured, she experienced an emotional crisis, which shattered
her defenses. The worker used this opportunity to review
questions that had been answered earlier. Initially distrusting
and self-protective, Nikki had denied having any immediate
family in the area, stating "They're back in North Carolina."
Sensing her enormous anxiety in the hospital setting, the
worker took Nikki to the cafeteria, bought her some coffee,
and shared with this distraught African American parent the
worker's own experiences with helping families who had
migrated from North Carolina.

The worker asked, "Are you sure you don't have any folks
here? It's very unusual that a young mother would come north
with no people here!" Nikki broke into a new flood of tears.
She shared that she did have an aunt and several cousins here
but that they were angry with her for living with a man,
unmarried, and they did not want to visit her. She had run
away from her children's father because he had been incarcerated
for murder in a street brawl in North Carolina and tried
to control her activities from the state prison through his
friends. She was too proud to take welfare assistance and
possessed only a fifth-grade education. She only knew how to
pick tobacco and sharecrop. She was still intimidated by the
city, and now she was both fearful of the boyfriend and
isolated from her family.


By avoiding prejudgment and stereotyping, the worker in this
scenario was able to authentically engage the mother during the
disclosure of child sexual abuse. The worker also recognized the
cultural resiliency in the young woman. Although she had suffered
from her selection of mates, failed to protect her daughters,
appeared to be subordinate in all her relationships, and had been
reared in a racially harsh and unsupportive community, she took
pride in her children, was highly attached to them, and was
willing to work closely with a professional to get them back. The
path to reunification took 9 months. This seemingly passive,
dependent parent (a) participated in therapy for herself and in
conjoint and family therapy with her daughters, who were angry
due to the lack of protection; (b) advocated for subsidy to obtain
her own apartment; (c) obtained a court restraining order when
her boyfriend threatened her in the neighborhood; and (d) began
to seek work with help from her family, who forgave Nikki once

[p. <i>237</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00257&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Challenges to Incorporating
the Culture Factor</i>


There are significant obstacles to accommodating cultural considerations
when assessing the risk of child maltreatment or its
recurrence. Most child protective service systems are generally
overextended and underfunded. The worker's caseload usually
does not encourage taking time to adequately engage families and
their support systems or to seek clarification or pertinent information
that may not be readily available or apparent due to
cultural differences. The worker's most formidable task is to
manage specific cultural differences that drive both the worker's
and the family's expectations of child safety and well-being; only
then can an effective contract be realized that ensures the child
protection mission. Indeed, although there may be considerable
agreement regarding when a child, minimally, is safe or thriving,
there are innumerable ways to approach this goal.


?<i>Getting Across the Culture Chasm</i>


In summary, the worker who recognizes that the acknowledgment
of cultural differences is an opportunity for making
certain that children are adequately nurtured and cared for is
more likely to be perceived as "real" or authentic by families who
are battling a variety of life challenges. The worker is more likely
to gain the data needed to assess both the level of risk and the
intensity and nature of the professional intervention needed,
including obtaining the family's "buy-in" and commitment to
change. The "culturally competent worker brings intellectual and

There is no single menu for integrating culture into the risk
assessment process; the worker, however, should routinely consider
the following factors:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• The family's cultural identification
</p>
</td></tr>

Culturally competent risk assessment involves a professional
use of self, which reflects a high respect and regard for the cultural
lifestyles and values of others. Culturally competent risk assessment
is not a form or a checklist, and it does not eliminate the
need for high-level thinking and reasoning. Emphasis should be
placed on weighing risk with strength, assessing child safety and
child status, and generalizing the application of cultural strengths
to parenting concerns. When risk assessment practices reflect the
integration of knowledge, skill, and an open mind-set, functional
"bridges" are built across the cultural chasm--bridges that bring
together responsible adults with a shared perspective. Children
then find safety, stability, true permanency, and empowering
support.

Once you have assessed that a child is unsafe (see Chapter
47, this volume), there are essentially three ways to keep
the child safe in his or her own home: (a) A nonoffending
parent or adult ensures the child's safety; (b) the offending person
vacates the home, and assurances exist that no return will occur;
and (c) a safety service plan ensures the child's safety.


? <i>Safety Ensured by Nonoffending Parent</i>


Consider a nonoffending parent or another adult who resides in
the home as a resource for in-home safety management. You can
use the following items to evaluate the nonoffending parent's or
other adult's potential to be protective:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Must be willing to provide protection and understand
why protection is necessary
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Must understand the nature of the protective responsibility,
what specifically will be required, and personal responsibilities
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>

• Must be physically able with respect to meeting the
demands for caring for and protecting the child, including
health, mobility, strength, stamina, and senses

• Must understand the nature of the protective responsibility,
what specifically will be required, and personal responsibilities

• Must not be fearful of or intimidated by the offender


• Must possess adequate physical prowess and courage to
face up to the offender


• Must be emotionally stable and calm


• Must possess sufficient cognitive capacity


• Must be able to follow instructions and the specific details
that form the safety plan


• Must be able to perceive circumstances accurately and
recognize danger


When evaluating an adult other than the child's parent as an
in-home safety resource, you can consider the degree of "closeness"
as a yardstick. Judge closeness by the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Whether the person resides or could reside in the home
most of the time on a daily basis
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How long the person has been involved with the family
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How close the association (familiarity and interest) is with
the child(ren)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How comfortable the person is in assuming a responsible
caregiving role
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>

• How long the person has been involved with the family


• How close the association (familiarity and interest) is with
the child(ren)


• How comfortable the person is in assuming a responsible
caregiving role


When assessing the ability to protect, you should evaluate the
nonoffending parent's or other adult's intentions:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Consider how convicted the person is in accepting the
responsibility by asking what he or she believes about the
reality of the threats, the requirements for protection,
what should be done, how protection should be achieved
and why he or she believes this is so.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Search for certainty in communication, physical expressions,
perceptions, and attitudes.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Judge whether there appears to be resolve to ensure that
the children are protected as evidenced by appropriate
emotion (concern to indignation about the danger, compassion
for the children, and a driven sense of determination).
</p>
</td></tr>

commitment to protect the child.

An effective indicator of the ability of a nonoffending parent
or other adult to provide protection to a child is a history of
protective behavior. The previous incident in which protective
behavior has been displayed should be described by the person in
detail. Can the account of protectiveness be verified? Ask about
cues that stimulated the person toward protective behaviors in
the past. Consider how the historical circumstances compare to
the current situation and the current threats. Is there evidence
that this is a person who always follows through? Others may be
able to advise you about the dependability of this person.


The nature of the relationship that exists between the nonoffending
parent or other adult and the child can be used to assess
the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• What is the person's viewpoint of the child generally (e.;g.;,
likeable, believable, and good)?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• What is the person's perception about the child's involvement
in the safety circumstance?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Does the person view the child as a victim or deserving?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Who is the person allied with? The child? The offending
parent?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• What is the quality of the relationship and attachment
between the person and the child?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Does the person value the child?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How is the relationship described from both the adult's
and the child's point of view?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Does the child trust the adult?
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>

Protective nonoffending parents or other adults typically respond
assertively:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• They believe the threats are real.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• They believe the child. Although they may not have been
aware of the need for protection or the presence of
threats, their awareness is readily achieved.

Ask the person to describe a personal plan for protecting the
child. Is it realistic? Does it demonstrate independence on the
part of the person? After fully exploring the person's ability to
protect, you should thoroughly document a plan that establishes
the suitability of the person to provide protection.


? <i>Safety Ensured by Offender
Leaving the Home</i>


You may be able to obtain child safety within the home if the
offending parent will leave. The "trick" to this approach lies in
the confidence you can acquire about whether the offending
person will honor the agreement and stay away from the family.
Be aware that some people may suggest this option as a way of
manipulating child protective services (CPS). A person could
identify this alternative because he or she is adamant about having
the offender gone. Parents may suggest this solution because it is
a reasonable way to avoid having the child removed. Other family
members may ask for this approach out of anger. (See Chapter
54, this volume, for factors to consider when making this decision.)
If the plan is for the offending parent to leave, you must
be confident about the motives involved and the reliability of this
action:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How believable is this person?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• What can you base your beliefs about this person on?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Is the person able to persuasively provide you with reasons
for you to believe him or her?

</td></tr>
</table>


• How believable is this person?


• What can you base your beliefs about this person on?


• Is the person able to persuasively provide you with reasons
for you to believe him or her?


Your assurance that this approach will work will depend on many
issues:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Will the person be next door or several miles away?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Can the person visit the child at places away from the
home?

• Can a petition be filed in court to specify agreements
about the offender's absence?


• What is the nonoffending parent's level of commitment
to protection?


• Can other supportive parties (e.;g.;, friends and extended
family) be enlisted to be aware of and report on the
success of the plan and notify CPS if the offender returns?


• What written communication is needed about the plan
with key parties?


• In addition to the offending person vacating the home,
what other provisions are needed (e.;g.;, communication
between parties, visitation, access, location, length of the
arrangement, and supervision)?


? <i>Safety Ensured Through a Safety Services Plan</i>


In many cases, it will be possible for you to manage child safety
in the home with one or both parents present. When implementing
an in-home safety plan, you need to clearly define what is
jeopardizing a child's safety and then appropriately match a plan
that will target these specific influences. After defining the threats
but before matching services, you should evaluate the family and
home context. The following critical questions apply:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Is the parent(s) willing to participate in and cooperate with
an in-home plan?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Is the home setting calm and consistent to accommodate
service providers?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Do you need specialized evaluations to proceed with an
in-home plan (e.;g.;, substance abuse and mental health)?
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


1. Is the parent(s) willing to participate in and cooperate with
an in-home plan?


2. Is the home setting calm and consistent to accommodate
service providers?


3. Do you need specialized evaluations to proceed with an
in-home plan (e.;g.;, substance abuse and mental health)?


Safety services should address basic safety needs; be immediate
in effect; be short term; control safety threats; be available,
sufficient, and accessible; and be suitable by relating specifically
to safety needs. Examples of safety services are supervision and
monitoring, basic parenting skills coaching (e.;g.;, how to mix

Weekly CPS oversight is fundamental to in-home safety management
and should be tailored to address the specific threats to
child safety. External safety checks and alerts can be arranged with
those who have frequent contact with the family. Safety contracts
should be written to describe threats to safety, expectations, roles,
responsibilities, tasks, and alternative behaviors or actions, such
as counting to 10 when one gets angry or a parent taking a
time-out.

Protection for children in a family with a history of domestic
violence relies on your interview and assessment and the
arrangement of safety and protection. Intervention by any
outside agency into these families may increase the danger of
domestic violence toward the victim and increase the risk of
maltreatment to the children; therefore, both steps must be
handled carefully.


? <i>Interview and Assessment</i>


Interviews generate the information from which you will assess
risk of maltreatment and evaluate the safety of the children. In
general, when you attempt to assess the risk to children,

Domestic violence poses increased risk and safety concerns
related to maltreatment. Protecting kids means searching for

It is rare for the batterer to be out of control. Violence is
usually the result of calculated decisions made on the part of a
batterer intent on getting something and exacting a price for it.
Children are most likely to get hurt unintentionally in domestic
violence episodes. Infants in arms are at risk of severe injury, as
are toddlers who are underfoot. Some children are tugged on by
parents and suffer dislocated joints, sprains, or fractures. Older
children attempting to intervene can suffer serious injury, as can
children of any age who find themselves in harm's way whenever
objects or liquids are thrown. All these scenarios indicate children's
need for protection because these safety concerns cannot
be addressed in standard child protective services (CPS) safety
planning.


? <i>Arranging Safety and Protection</i>


When arranging safety or protection, professionals who deal with
domestic violence daily should be involved. They can supplement
your assessment and provide outside resources for protection of
adult victims and children who need to separate from perpetrators.
Victim parents and children who are unsafe should be
sheltered--as a unit if possible. If families acknowledge domestic
violence but do not choose to separate, a thorough assessment of
risk and safety must be completed. Specific safety factors to
consider include the following:
<table>

<p>
• Stated intent to cause harm

<p>
• Rationalization of violent behavior
</p>

Each of these is a red flag; two or more are early warning signs
indicating the child's need for protection. A CPS safety plan
addressing each concern must be in place, or the children may
need to be sheltered until safety concerns are resolved. Once
concerns for the children's imminent safety are resolved, children
may be returned and a service plan can be implemented to
decrease the risk of future maltreatment.

Alcohol and drug problems are prime risk factors for child
maltreatment; effective intervention and treatment of the
addicted caregiver are a critical part of protecting children.
Also, in such cases, child abuse or neglect often occur not
only by the primary caregiver but also by associates (e.g., drug
dealers and other users).


The following misconceptions about addiction make effective
intervention a challenge for many professionals:


1. <i>The addict must want help</i>. Caught in a cycle of intoxication
and withdrawal, few addicts are capable of making a rational
decision for treatment. When they do seek help, it is usually
because of a temporary shortage of funds or to avoid one of the
many consequences of the addictive lifestyle, such as the loss of
job or family, medical problems, and a jail sentence. Once in
treatment, the addict feels better and thinks more clearly. In fact,
most addicts who successfully recover entered treatment against
their will. Treatment might be thought to have a cumulative
effect. Miller and Rollnick (1991) described the following stages
of change in working with involuntary clients: precontemplation,

[p. <i>251</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00271&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

2. <i>Addicts cannot quit until other problems are solved</i>. Although
addicts blame their drug use on outside circumstances,
the reality is that they cannot address their numerous life problems
until the destructive pattern of chemical use has been
interrupted. It is important to remember that active addiction and
early recovery mimic most psychiatric diagnoses. It is usually
good practice to treat the client for most psychiatric problems
while at the same time addressing the addiction and drug toxicity.


3. <i>The addict may be able to quit without help</i>. Although most
addicts experience periods of less intense use, the nature of
addiction is to progress to more profound dysfunction. Few are
able to achieve stable recovery without treatment.


As professionals, we counteract the destructive power of the
addict's compulsion through the intelligent use of leverage and
influence. In a situation involving child maltreatment, the professional
may be able to give the caregiver a choice between
accepting treatment for addiction and a loss of rights or privileges
involving the child (e.g., visitation and custody). Case managers
may also have considerable influence over an addict via their role
in legal decisions such as termination of parental rights. The
threat of a real and immediate consequence is the best way to
motivate a resistant addict or alcoholic to take the initial steps
toward change.


To determine the appropriate level of addiction treatment
required, seek the assistance of an addictions professional at your
local public or private clinic. An assessment using one of several
standardized instruments will help determine the best modality
based on the extent and severity of the addiction. To assess an addicted
caregiver's status in treatment, ask yourself if he or she is

and the general home situation. Good treatment involves family
members. Many programs provide education and counseling for

Home accidents pose a serious risk to young children.
They are responsible for more than 90% of all fatalities
and injuries to children younger than 5 years of age.
Similarly, health risks can create many serious problems for young
children, including infections and disease from harmful agents in
unkempt homes such as fecal matter on the floor or dangerous
bacteria from spoiled food. It has been suggested that virtually
no injury is accidental; many can be anticipated and prevented.
The job of the parent and the human service professional is to
provide as safe an environment as possible for children to prevent
injuries.


? <i>Assessment</i>


In 1984, my colleagues and I created the Home Accident Prevention
Inventory (HAPI; Table 52.1) to help professionals or parents
assess the hazards in their homes. Recently, the HAPI was
revised (HAPI-R). Hazards are categorized as fire and electrical,

[p. <i>255</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00275&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I007&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Examples of fire and electrical hazards include matches and
cigarette lighters left on a coffee table and a missing fire screen
in front of a fireplace. Small objects on the floor may lead to a
young child choking. Other common problems include guns
under kitchen and bathroom sinks and poisonous items, such as
common household plants, cleaners and solvents, polishes and
waxes, medications, and cosmetics. Balconies may have slats
through which a young child could fall, and many swimming
pools are not properly fenced off.


We also developed the Checklist for Living Environments to
Assess Neglect (CLEAN) to help professionals or parents count
items around a home that represent clutter and to assess filth such
as decaying food.


? <i>Management Strategies</i>


There are three treatment modes for safety and health. Counselor
education, the first approach, is instruction to eliminate hazards
systematically, room by room, by removing hazards such as small
objects and covering electrical outlets.


For families with filthy and cluttered homes, posting photos
depicting improvements in targeted rooms may help. Small incentives

[p. <i>256</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00276&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Counselor education is effective but time-consuming. Thus,
we have also used a slide tape program and, recently, a video
program.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_271870');">[note]</a><div id="_note_271870" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. The videos, the HAPI-R, and the CLEAN can be ordered at cost from
Dr. John R. Lutzker, University of Judaism, 15600 Mulholland Drive, Los
Angeles, CA 90077.</div>
The video program, which has five parts, has been very
effective, particularly with minimal counseling. Parents viewing
the video have shown generalization, removing hazards from
rooms not yet discussed in the video.


It should be noted that the normal, healthy curiosity of
children can cause them to "get into trouble" with hazards in a
home. Anticipating and preventing "accidents" is key; getting
angry "after the fact" makes less sense.

Types of Family Preservation Services


According to standards defined by the Child Welfare League of
America, family preservation services may be of the following
types:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Intensive family-centered crisis services. Best known is the
Homebuilders' crisis intervention model, which provides services
intensively (several times a week during a 4- to 6-week time
period) to build family skills and understanding and to meet their
basic needs. Typically, workers are trained specifically in the
Homebuilders' model and serve only two or three families at a
time. Homebuilders' services work particularly well with families
involved in physical abuse or status offenses. Other models of
intensive family-centered crisis services provide approximately
the same amount of service but do so less frequently and during
a 3- or 4-month period. These services may include family and
individual therapy as well as skill building and concrete services.
They also may assist the family in working with other systems in
the community, such as the schools. Longer, more systemic
services work best with families in which sexual abuse or juvenile
delinquency is the problem.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Family-centered casework services. These services are generally
not in response to a specific crisis but provided to families
with longer term, more chronic problems such as neglect. They
may last 6 to 18 months and provide a comprehensive array of
services to meet the family's many needs, often using paraprofessional
aides to provide in-home services. Families who are not
motivated to cooperate with services may respond best to offers
of assistance in building support for the family and meeting the
children's needs. They may need to be contacted persistently at
least once a week for the first 3 months, and then they can

consolidate and maintain their gains with one or two contacts a
month for a more extended period of time.

3. Family resource, support, and education services. These services
are generally voluntary and provide a range of supports to
high-risk families (day care, housing assistance, parent education,
and support groups) in their own communities. They are sometimes
located in neighborhood centers or schools. They may be
useful to families who are not yet threatened with placement but
who are at risk of future child abuse or neglect.


? <i>When Should Family Preservation
Services Be Considered?</i>


Family preservation services should be considered whenever a
child may be placed out of the home or moved to a new
placement--for example,
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• When families are first contacted by a child protective
worker: In a pilot project, placements were dramatically
reduced in counties that teamed family preservation
workers with child protective service workers for the
initial 2 weeks of contact. In addition, families received
more services and had fewer repeated incidents of child
abuse or neglect.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• When there has been a recent crisis in the home that has
led to child abuse or neglect: Many families reported to
child welfare agencies are under severe or recent stress or
both that may include loss of housing or a job; death,
divorce, or separation; and an illness, accident, or the
birth of another child. In these circumstances, immediate,
intensive services may avert additional deterioration of
the family and prevent the placement of a child. In such
cases, the first consideration should be the safety of the
child. Immediate threats to the child's safety, including
lack of supervision for young children, serious injuries,
unsafe housing, an urgent need for medical care, and
continuing violence or threat of violence in the home,
should be assessed and addressed by creating a safety plan.
</p>
<p>

For example, a depressed mother with several young
children who is living in a shelter might be encouraged to
let her mother or sister provide care for her children while
she recovers her energy and finds new housing with the
support of the family preservation worker. In cases of
physical abuse, the use of crisis cards (suggesting alternative
responses), respite care, or 24-hour access to a neighbor,
family member, or family preservation worker might
be sufficient to ensure safety. In other situations, another
adult in the home, a family member, or a home aide may
be able to provide support and supervision. A child should
be removed only as a last resort, when no other arrangement
can ensure his or her safety.

• When families are first contacted by a child protective
worker: In a pilot project, placements were dramatically
reduced in counties that teamed family preservation
workers with child protective service workers for the
initial 2 weeks of contact. In addition, families received
more services and had fewer repeated incidents of child
abuse or neglect.


• When there has been a recent crisis in the home that has
led to child abuse or neglect: Many families reported to
child welfare agencies are under severe or recent stress or
both that may include loss of housing or a job; death,
divorce, or separation; and an illness, accident, or the
birth of another child. In these circumstances, immediate,
intensive services may avert additional deterioration of
the family and prevent the placement of a child. In such
cases, the first consideration should be the safety of the
child. Immediate threats to the child's safety, including
lack of supervision for young children, serious injuries,
unsafe housing, an urgent need for medical care, and
continuing violence or threat of violence in the home,
should be assessed and addressed by creating a safety plan.

• In cases of sexual abuse when the perpetrator is out of the
home or admitting his or her responsibility and the
nonoffending caregiver is protective: In sexual abuse
cases, family preservation services are provided to support
the recovery of the victim and prevent removal from
the nonoffending parent. If the parent does not believe
the child or sides with the offender, family preservation
services are not appropriate.


• Before a decision to place is made in nonemergency cases:
In many cases, the danger to the child is not sudden or
the result of a specific action but cumulative through lack
of attention to the child's needs. In the event that longer
term supportive services do not succeed in assisting the
parent to provide adequate care, placement may be necessary.


• Before a decision to reunify is made: One of the most
successful applications of family preservation services has
been in reunifying children in placement with their families.
Because decisions about permanency may have to be
made within as short a time period as 12 months, even if
a child is in placement, intensive services may be warranted.
Intensive services during the reunification process
may be followed by longer term, more infrequent services
or "booster shots" to help families maintain stability.
Several studies have shown higher rates of successful and
stable reunification when family preservation services are
employed.

This chapter reviews the factors to consider when making
a decision whether to remove a child or an alleged offender
from a home. It is currently recommended that the
alleged offender be removed rather than the child if the safety
and well-being of the child cannot be ensured in the home. It is
also recommended that, whenever possible, removal decisions be
made as part of a multidisciplinary team approach to case management.


? <i>What Factors Should Be Assessed in
Determining the Necessity for Removal?</i>


Although it is not known exactly which of the following factors
places a child at increased risk, careful consideration should be
given to each factor. When several factors are present, a child is
considered to be at risk, and removal should occur--typically of
the alleged offender.


1. <i>Child factors</i>


Safety of the child and other children in the home;

[p. <i>263</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00283&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Vulnerability due to mental or physical disabilities


Basic needs not being met (e.g., food, shelter, and clothing)


2. <i>Factors related to the abusive behavior</i> (These factors apply
to all forms of maltreatment.)


Frequency, duration, and severity of current and past abuse


Lack of plausible explanation of how injury, incident, or
situation occurred


Lack of appropriate supervision


Intent to harm the child (i.e., difference between intent to
harm and intent to discipline or punish)


3. <i>Nonoffending parent factors</i>


Uncooperative with child protective services (CPS); unwilling
to follow treatment plan


Does not believe the child's report


Blames the child for the abuse


Believes and attempts to protect the alleged offender


Consistent problems in overall level of functioning


History of past abuse or neglect of children


Lack of satisfactory utilization of past services


History of childhood abuse or current spouse abuse


Use of drugs or alcohol


Highly dependent, psychologically or economically, on the
alleged offender


4. <i>Alleged offender factors</i>


History of past abuse of children


Inability to control behavior, such as history of spouse abuse,
substance abuse, or serious mental health problems


Ongoing access to the child



[p. <i>264</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00284&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

History of intimidating nonoffending parent or child


Lack of parenting knowledge, skills, and motivation to learn


5. <i>Other family factors</i>


Condition of the home hazardous


Lack of social support network, such as extended family,
friends, or religious organization


High level of family conflict or stress, such as birth of child
or loss of housing or benefits


Other family pressures on the child to recant


? <i>What Are the Typical Effects
of Removal on the Child?</i>


1. Effects can range from minimal to severe based on numerous
factors, such as the severity and duration of the abuse, the
child's overall adjustment, other family members' responses,
the familiarity and stability of the placement setting, and the
nonoffending parent's belief and support of the child.
(Note: The belief and support of the nonoffending parent
continue to be crucial factors in the child's short-term and
long-term adjustment.)


2. The initial effects are usually mild to moderate behavioral
(aggression and anger) and affective (fearfulness and depression) responses.


3. Over time, in stable placements most children adjust satisfactorily.


4. Some children continue to have highly problematic behavior;
it is likely, however, that this is due to a combination of
the removal, the past abuse, and other psychological factors.


? <i>What Are the Potential Effects of
Removing the Alleged Offender?</i>


1. Child


<i>Potential positive effects:</i> The child feels believed and supported
by the nonoffending parent; has less disruption in

[p. <i>265</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00285&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Potential negative effects:</i> The child feels guilty, may be
blamed by family members, and may change the report of
abuse.


2. Nonoffending parent


<i>Potential positive effects:</i> Removal can indicate that professionals
believe the child, reinforce the parent's role as
protector of the child, emphasize the seriousness of alleged
offender's behavior, and reduce conflict of parent choosing
between child and alleged offender.


<i>Potential negative effects:</i> Nonoffending parent may punish
or put pressure on the child to change the abuse report, feel
guilty, have fewer economic resources, and be blamed or
punished by the alleged offender and other family members.


3. Alleged offender


<i>Potential positive effects:</i> Removal can indicate the seriousness
of the behavior, reflect that professionals believe the
child, result in an admission, and lead to seeking treatment.


<i>Potential negative effects:</i> The alleged offender may become
more defensive and angry, less cooperative with CPS, and
less likely to financially support the family.


? <i>How Do I Make the Decision?</i>


It is recommended that information from other agencies, disciplines,
and professionals be considered in a multidisciplinary case
staffing when removal decisions are made.


<i>Removal of the alleged offender:</i> The alleged offender
should be removed if the child's safety and well-being
in the home cannot be ensured.


<i>Removal of the child:</i> The child should be removed when
the nonoffending parent does not believe the child and
is not capable or willing to protect the child from
additional abuse.

Prior to placing a child, you assess for risk of maltreatment
in foster care or kinship care by gathering and analyzing
sufficient information that emphasizes strengths and resources
while illuminating risk factors and concerns. There are
practical differences in assessing foster parent applicants and
kinship situations. Foster parent applicants offer their services.
Their offer does not necessarily involve a particular child. They
do not know a child's family. You seek out kinship care arrangements.
Kin know the child, may have a relationship with the
child, and may have formed specific perceptions about the child.
They know the child's parents. Both kinds of families are predisposed
to bring their values, attitudes, and biases to the caregiving
situation, some of which may be ill informed.


Information collection should include face-to-face interviews
with the family, adults individually, the family's own children
individually, and collateral sources. A child's parents may have
important information to offer about the kinship family.


Your information collection approach is different from a child
protection services risk assessment interview. You are seeking a
resource on behalf of a child. Nothing has been alleged against
the prospective foster or kinship family. The introductory message
emphasizes (a) the importance of the quality of homes

As in assessing a child's own family, there are certain areas
within the kinship and foster family system that must be evaluated,
including the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How does the foster or kinship family's own child(ren)
function?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How do the adult caregivers function generally? Consider
the adults' relationships beyond the family (e.g., in the
neighborhood, with extended family, and at work).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How do the adult caregivers function as parents? Assess
the caregivers' general parenting toward their own children.
Explore issues of discipline. Be informed about the
parenting history, knowledge, and expectations for children
generally. Screen for any reports of maltreatment or
history of maltreatment on the kinship or foster family
among its own members.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How does the kinship or foster family function (without
the placed child)? Assess the involvement of the extended
family.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How do the kinship or foster family parents view birth
parents that maltreat or place their children? Specifically,
how does the kinship family regard the related birth
parents?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• What are the demographics of the kinship or foster
family? Consider stress and resources.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• What attitudes, motivation, and commitment exist in the
kinship or foster family among all members (adults and
children) to accept and include the placed child in the
family? How is the decision made? Who is included in the
decision?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• What reasons are provided for becoming a family for the
placed child? Is there variation in feeling among family
members (particularly adults) about accepting the child?
</p>

• How has this family prepared for the placement?


• How are adult caregiver expectations for their own children
similar to or different from their expectations of the
placed child? Assess to what extent children are valued in
the family and how this is expressed.


• What is the nature of attachment among family members?
Look for closeness, acceptance, understanding, expressions
of endearment, demonstrations of affection, and
supportive communication. Assess whether this same behavior
is present or possible with the placed child.


Once the child has been placed, continuing risk assessment
considers the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• What is the level of acceptance of the placed child into
the family? Notice whether the placed child is included
in family routines and life. Examine family interaction.
Determine the child's given place in the family: Does the
child have a physical identity (a place or a chair)? Is the
child fully or selectively involved? Does all communication
include the child? Does the family share equally with
the child?
</p>
</td></tr>

• Are the kinship or foster parents' expectations for the
placement and the child being met?

expectations, style, and responses to the placed
child? How do the parents compare these to those of their
own children, and what is their rationale?

placed child do the kinship or foster parents hold (negative,
superficial, individualized, or accurate)?

• What does the child report? Listen for acceptance into
and involvement with the family or exceptions or differences
between how the family deals with its own children
and the placed child. You must be discriminating with
respect to a placed child's need to cast the family in a
negative light because of his or her own adjustment
difficulties with the situation.

the child has about family members, being placed
away from home, being with kin, being with strangers,
and so on.


• What expectations does the child have for this family

Do they stimulate positive or negative reactions from
family members (and caregivers specifically)? Do they
result in the child behaving in challenging and difficult
ways?


• What are the similarities and differences between the
placed child and other children in the family? Consider
details about the children in the home and examine how
the placed child is either different or viewed as different
in ways that provoke mistreatment. Examine adjustment
in the home and changes in the child since placement
occurred.
