One morning about 9:00 my phone rang. I answered it
and a slurred voice said, "Help me."


I had been speaking to groups for almost six months and wasn't
alarmed at receiving such a phone call from a stranger. Quickly
I said, "Where are you and what have you taken?"


She managed to give me her address. I hung up, called Jim, and
told him where I would be. "If I don't call back in an hour, come
look for me."


I ran to the car and drove to the address. No one answered my
knock so I found a side door open and let myself in. Lying on
the couch was a woman I recognized from a talk I had given the
week before. After that meeting she had come to me, crying, and
I had talked to her for about an hour. Not quite strong enough
to agree to an appointment with my doctor, she had at least agreed
to my giving her his name on the back of my business card. Now
she had cried help by taking a bottle of aspirins and then calling
me before they could take effect.


I shook her until she would tell me her medical doctor's name.
When I reached him on the telephone, he told me to induce vomiting.
It was difficult for me to get the woman, who was quite heavy and
already staggering, to the bathroom. I poured mustard and water
into her, but though she retched, she couldn't bring up the medicine.
She slumped to the floor, and I ran back to the phone to tell the

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697849-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I took time to call a FISH representative and quickly told her
my problem. "There are two infants in the home and I can't leave
until they have care," I explained.


Then I ran back to the woman. When I tried to make her stand,
she cried, "Just let me alone. I want to die."


"Maybe you do," I said, "but you didn't take enough medicine
to do the job. You're just going to be a mighty sick girl if you
don't get yourself to the hospital."


When the FISH volunteer came, I drove the woman to the hospital
and stayed in the waiting room until her husband arrived. He stammered
out his version of their family troubles--frequent moves, lack
of money, his wife's problem of overweight, two children too close
together.


When at last her stomach was emptied, she was released. We
drove back to her house. She was silent and ashamed of what she
had done.


While we were gone, five other volunteers had come into the
home and washed the dishes and thoroughly cleaned the house. The
children were bathed, in clean clothes, and fed. In a few hours,
several people had heeded this woman's cry for emergency help.


Now that the first step had been taken, her husband contacted
a psychiatrist. After a preliminary consultation, the woman was
admitted to the hospital. She responded to treatment and after three
weeks was allowed a weekend at home. Another week and a half
and she was dismissed.


The following evening one of the children began crying. The
husband moved to the crib to pat the child. When the baby didn't
stop crying, the pats became harder until he found himself beating
it to stop the incessant sound of its crying. The next morning the
husband was admitted to the hospital. By the time he was discharged,
he had lost his job and the bills were staggering. His mother arrived
on the next plane, helped them store their belongings, and with
them started the drive back down south to their home town. In
the last letter I received from the woman, she told me they were
on welfare and both of them struggling to become competent enough
to look for part-time jobs.


My heart aches for them in their long struggle. They had waited

Like most people, I was unaware of the effects of mental illness,
its treatment or percentage of recovery, until it had happened to
me. Up to that time I had occasionally heard whispers about people
having been admitted to state asylums; I knew that shock treatment
was supposedly a horror too terrible to mention and that people
who broke with reality continued to be strange for the rest of their
lives. But it had not happened to any member of my family close
enough for me to get involved.


Simultaneously with my breakdown, several people I knew were
admitted to the hospital--a friend of mine, one of my relatives, the
daughter of one of my former neighbors and two other people from
my church. This was enough to alarm me. I became concerned not
only for my own health, but theirs. Already I wanted to know the
whys and hows of temporary mental illness. In the hospital I started
keeping notes for the day when I would be able to write of my
experiences for my own therapy and for the comfort of others like
me.


Many people had suggestions about how I should write my story.
Some wanted an updated <i>Snake Pit</i>, others wanted a biting exposé
of mental institutions, some wanted to be horrified. Very few, it
seems, wanted to be enlightened. Finally I wrote a personal experience
article, hoping it would at least speak to the other patients.
I was not prepared for the reaction. Letters began arriving from
all over the United States.


Many of them began as this woman did: "I just read your article
and cried bitter tears. Why? Because I know what you have gone
through and what lies ahead. I went through just such an ordeal."


Another woman wrote, "My friend called and told me to read
your article; she said it was just like me."


Two elderly women wrote to express their love and sympathy.
One enclosed a hand-carved sandalwood fan and the other a crocheted
cross book mark.


One person wrote and assured me that if I ate soya powder and
wheat germ I would be cured.

Thank-you-grams arrived from various businesses.


One letter, was written on motel stationery. The woman was in
the process of moving and while at the motel took time to confess
her own breakdown.


An editor for a magazine where I published saw my byline and
offered the magazine's appreciation for my telling a heartbreaking
experience.


My sixth-grade teacher sent word that she was proud to have
been one of my teachers.


Another wrote, "I had a nervous breakdown after the death of
my little boy. Thank you for sharing your experience with the public.
They will recognize your honesty."


"God has strange ways to paint the picture of life. With the gray
the brightest colors do their best." This came from an elderly woman
I had worked with in a restaurant ten years before. By cooking,
cleaning, and sewing, she had supported her husband, who had
Parkinson's disease, and her father, who had been bedridden since
the early 1940s. She was well acquainted with the gray of life, but
I had never known her not to smile.


I breathed a sigh of relief. I had been fearful of exposing my
family to possible public ridicule. As I had no way of knowing how
people would respond to reading of our experience, it was with relief
that I opened and read each letter of appreciation.


Most of our letters were addressed only to Nancy Smith, North
Canton, Ohio. The post office was in favor of returning them or
dropping them into the dead-letter box. After persuading them to
send a notice to all of their sorters they agreed to forward those
they recognized in time. I was glad they did, because many of them
included cries for help.


"I live in a small town and they are treating me like an oddity.
Please talk to me."


"Ever since I have been ill I have been hoping that someone,
somewhere, existed who knew and understood how I feel. I feel
so helpless. Where do I start?"


"I was in a convent when I had my breakdown. I felt I had
to stay there to prove myself. Truly it takes more than just an exterior
faith to recover from a breakdown. A person has to regain faith

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697849-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I would like to talk to you, but don't come when my husband
is home. My father-in-law said it would be better to lose my mind
and go to heaven than to go to the devil (psychiatrist) for help.
Be thankful you have an understanding family. It is torture to be
condemned for being what I am and basically they have made me
what I am."


"I did all that the doctor said and now my wife turned against
me. I realize that you are qualified by experience only, but I'm
grabbing at straws. Should I give her a separation? I would appreciate
your comments. Thank you for your article."


"From an active, busy woman who held a responsible, good-paying
job, who had a great sense of humor and enjoyed life and people,
I have become completely immobile. I'm afraid to be alone. Some
days seem like an eternity. I re-read and re-read and re-read your
article. One thing you said, ‘Other people have fought what I am
fighting and have recovered.’ I have been trying only two years.
Perhaps I will recover too."


How I wished I could give them something more in return than
a friendly letter of understanding.


While the mail came in batches, the telephone never stopped
ringing. The first three weeks I spent between five and six hours
a day talking to strangers. I asked them not to tell me their names,
because they talked to me of every possible personal problem and
I didn't want to remember these confessions or be able to identify
them with any particular person.


I soon learned that they could not be hurried. They had many
things to talk about, and I was only expected to listen. Many of
them began their conversation with "I know you can't help me
but ..."


One woman telephoned me from Florida and talked fifty-five
minutes long distance. I tried to remind her of the bill she was
running up but she was too intent on telling her story. Her husband
had left her as soon as he discovered the diagnosis of her trouble.
He was a lawyer and he was afraid the publicity would ruin his

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697849-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

About half of the people who called were anticipating breakdowns.
They read themselves into the article and were frightened when they
knew they had these symptoms. They asked the procedure for obtaining
help. I suggested a priest or minister, their medical doctor, a
social worker, a clinical psychologist, a psychiatrist. One by one
they would reject my suggestions, always with a shallow excuse.
Eventually they would hang up, thanking me for my time and saying,
"I'll keep trying a while longer; maybe I can make it without anyone
knowing I'm having problems." I was disappointed when the telephone
connection broke. I felt they wouldn't find success in
that direction any more than I had.


Eventually Jim noticed my exhaustion. I was beginning to dread
the ring of the telephone. I was so tired of being asked for help
that I couldn't give. Each person needed time and love and I couldn't
be the savior for all of them. I felt defeated as we closed the house
and left for two weeks vacation.


As I lay on the sand by the ocean, I thought of all the faceless
people I had touched in the last few weeks. Sharing my experience
wasn't enough; they wanted someone to help them through their
own trial. But how?


When I came home I prepared four speeches. One on my breakdown
and recovery, one on treatment and psychoanalysis, one on
mental illness and the family, and one on faith and hope. If I couldn't
help each patient, then their families and friends would have to
be educated on how to help them.


I began talking one night a week to people, mostly secular groups.
The churches still seemed reluctant to say, "We, too, need instruction."


I told program chairmen, "I will not come just to entertain you
or to shock you, and I hope you will not interpret my talk as a
plea for pity. I realize that doctors often use technical terms and
talk over the heads of the audience. They forget how little we really
know about mental illness. I will try to inform your group in laymen's
language what they can do to help individuals or themselves if need

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697849-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The speech soon proved to be the shortest part of the evening.
My longest question and answer period was two and a half hours.
At the end of that time I pleaded with them to stop, because I
was too tired to think any more. During the refreshments my coffee
gets cold as I try to answer questions that are too personal to be
asked from the floor. The last question is always at my car, because
even as I leave a cluster of people follows me.


I can't believe that I am that accomplished a speaker. I have
to believe that the public is hungry for knowledge in this field.
If this is true, then it is a much needed awakening.


I arrive home late and very tired, but content. I have to force
myself to sleep quickly. The next morning I know the phone will
ring and I will need to talk further to someone from the evening
before. The calls come in early, because this is the hardest time
of the day for a mental patient. He sees the day stretched before
him and he can't believe he will have the strength to live through
it.


I'm willing to talk to these people, but they have to realize one
very important thing: when I say, in my talk, that people must
give love, understanding, and compassion to patients, I'm not saying
that I'm going to be that person for every patient.


When I suggest to a woman that she talk to her husband the
way she is talking to me, she says, "It wouldn't do any good, he
wouldn't listen."


"Then you must make him listen. I won't be around for you
to lean on."


Sometimes a representative of a family will call and plead with
me to come and talk to a member of the family. Though it is often
difficult, I have to say, "No, <i>you</i> talk to that person. You give
him the love you want me to give him. You hold his hand. It will
be you, not me, who will live with him the next years. It's your
responsibility." Just reading about mental illness or listening to a
lecture isn't enough. The people have to practice the advice they
receive.


Jim has teased me and suggested that I might like to open a
commune for patients in our backyard. Yes, at times I would like

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697849-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One afternoon I picked up a woman at the mental health day-care
center. I was on FISH call and she needed transportation home.
She was a tall woman, red-haired, loud-spoken. After she had crawled
into the car and we had started, she said, "You'd better be scared.
I'm a mental patient."


"I know."


"Well, aren't you scared I'll hurt you?"


"I'm a mental patient too. Are you afraid I'll hurt you?"


She looked at me through a haze of cigarette smoke. "But I was
in the hospital."


I smiled, "So was I."


We were like two children trying to outdo each other.


"I had shock treatments," she said.


"So did I."


"I had seven."


"I had fourteen," I replied.


She looked at me a few minutes and then she grinned. "You
win, you were sicker. Now let's talk."


And we did talk, warmly and deeply, the rest of the ride to her
home.


Occasionally I will run into one of the people I was with in the
hospital, and we have an emotional reunion there on the street.
It is wonderful to see a person neatly dressed, walking briskly with
his or her family, smiling and competent, when I have only known
that person during his depression. The change is miraculous.


The first time it happened to me I was waiting to pay my check
in a restaurant, when I recognized the woman in front of me. I
touched her arm. "Do you remember me?" I asked.


She frowned and said, "Yes, from the hospital. You were one
of my nurses, weren't you?"


"No, honey," I laughed, "I was there right along with you."

She is now working and is no longer under a doctor's care.


Sally, my roommate, and I saw each other another evening and
she came to visit me. She proceeded with her third divorce, has
moved to an apartment and is working. This time she isn't running
to a new man but is learning to find security in her own judgment.


Little Kim is now a young lady of seventeen. Her parents and
she have moved to another state. Kim says the house is beautiful,
situated in the country up in the hills. She is now attending public
school, and though she still needs a doctor's help, she hasn't run
away again.


Carrie, our grandmother, was the only one who was institutionalized
-- not because she would do harm to herself or to others
but because she had no family and there was no other place for
her to go. I hope she's content and that when she asks, "Any whiskey,
cigarettes, or a chew for Carrie?" someone occasionally can comply.


Many people have seen and are seeing the gray of life, but the
colors do begin to show again.


Depression does burn out ... happiness does return.
