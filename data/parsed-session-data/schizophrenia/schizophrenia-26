ECCLESIASTES


ON March 1 I was sent by ambulance, again flat on my
back, to the veterans' hospital, sixty miles from Washington,
at Perrypoint, Maryland. This was a hospital for chronically
disturbed, mentally ill veterans. I was taken to the admission
office and given an examination by the officer in charge. From
there I was taken past rows of dingy buildings to a building near
the woods, and my heart sank as I saw the place that was to
be my new home. The building was two stories and U-shaped,
and the extensions of the "U" were covered with bars and wires.
I saw the patients sitting on the porches—just sitting.


I was taken into the building, given some medicine, and then
taken by an attendant up an elevator that had to be unlocked
with a key to the second floor, for patients under observation.
This was obviously an inferior-type hospital compared to the one
I had left. The attendants' uniforms were not too clean, and the

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At this place I finally got the message of what it was like to
be mentally ill. I saw only two doctors for the whole building of
patients, and two nurses—one on each floor. The attendants
seemed to come from the lowest possible educational level.


The attendants played poker boisterously every night at
the door of the ward where patients were trying to sleep.
Cigarettes were kept by an attendant and doled out one at a
time. I found out I had to stay here till I was finally discharged
from the Air Force, and it would take another month to clear
the paperwork. In that time, I would not be allowed to go home
to visit.


I complained to Mary that the conditions were horrible,
and that I couldn't get well in this environment. She came up
to see me three days after I got there, and talked with my
doctor. I told her to have it out with my doctor, and to get me
out of here immediately. She talked to the doctor, and when she
saw how insistent I was on getting out of the filthy place, she
cried. She had taken one look at the building and the attendants
and said she didn't like the place. She seemed to be in a

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That night I was transferred again upstairs. I wondered why.
I had talked with Mary and told her the night before she came
that I had been put on open ward. After she talked with the
doctor, I was again locked up. I hated to think that she had
anything to do with this. The old patients started telling me
then that I was in my wife's hands, and that she could do anything
she wanted with me as my guardian. Every time I called
Mary the phone was either busy or she was, and didn't want
to talk with me. We were on Chesapeake Bay, and the sea
gulls almost drove me nuts in the early morning.


I called Mary and asked her to make arrangements to put
me in a private hospital; she hemmed and hawed and said she
would see what she could do. I asked the doctor if I could go
home for the week end, and he said no. The old patients finally
wised me up. The doctor could not keep me here if I was not
committed by a court, and the only way they could refuse
to let me go home was for my family to refuse to let me come
home. Evidently Mary had refused me access to my home since
January, but why?


She came the next day, and waited for me to be brought
down by elevator. She gave me what appeared to be a guilty
kiss, and we went into the visiting room. I attempted to take
her in the ward to show her how we lived—almost on top of
one another, but the attendant blocked the way. I implored her
to get me out, and if she didn't want me at home to let me
stay at Mom Hoskins' or go home to North Carolina. I told her
she held the power over me, and she said yes and that she
didn't like it. I tested her by saying, "You know you can't get a
divorce while I'm here," and she said, "Oh, can't I?" My heart
broke at that answer. I knew she didn't love me anymore, and I
faced what I should have seen several months before, if I had
not been so worried about my condition. I begged her to get me
out of the hospital and let me go home to my parents, and she
said, "I hate to see you beg, Jinx." I told her I shouldn't
have to beg, and as she had seen the condition of the hospital

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Her father was remarrying at Easter, and she said she would
be going to Connecticut then. My parents had written that they
would be here at Easter, and I wanted her to stay and talk with
them and make arrangements for them to get me out of this hellhole.
She acted unconcerned, and I told her that I would kill
her if she left me here to rot. I was determined that I would
not stay here and degenerate like the other patients. I told her
that I would give her the money that we had saved, and would
even let her keep my pension, which she controlled until she
was married again; but if she did not get me out I would kill
her.


I succeeded in convincing the doctor that I should be placed
on the open ward. With this bit of progress I was able in the
afternoon to play golf on the nine-hole course on the reservation.
Mornings I was assigned to the occupational therapy bunding,
which did little more than to get the patients off the wards
and to keep them busy during the day. The patients spent most
of their time there talking and drinking Coca-Colas. There
were quite a few women at the reservation. We were all transported
to occupational therapy in buses, with attendants riding
along with us. The doors were closed and locked on entering
the building. There were bars everywhere—on windows and
doors, and even the screens were made of steel mesh.


One day I took a sharp instrument with the idea of dispatching
Mary in mind, but could not successfully hide it in the
domiciliary quarters. So many doors Were clicking closed behind
me that if I had not been sick already I would have gotten ill.
A colonel who had been in the military hospital with me was
also on the ward with me. He, however, had full privileges and
went to Washington each week end.


Our clothes were kept downstairs, and if an occasion arose
for which we needed them, we had to get permission to go
downstairs to pick them up.

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Food was served cafeteria style in the basement, and it was
not too bad. I often got in trouble with the attendants for
leaving my tray on the table. For five years now I had, out of
force of habit, left my tray on the table, as there were always
waitresses to clean the tables in the dining room. I was reminded
not too gently that I was no longer in the service, and I was
required to clean the dishes and place the silverware in the
large container at the end of the dining room. After eating,
we had to wait for the other patients to go through the line
and finish their meal. The doors leading upstairs were locked,
and no one could leave the area till all the patients had finished
eating.


Some afternoons we were herded together and taken for a
walk through the woods, and I made mental notes of the direction
to take in case I had a chance to get away. And escape
I would. I had no intention of spending my life here and becoming
one of these outcasts.


I had been warned by the old patients that I talked about my
wife too much, and that I should refrain from any discussion
on the subject as the very walls had ears, and a bird of the air
would repeat the conversation. I was so disappointed and felt so
deserted that my thoughts dwelt continually on my family.
I felt that some of the staff took advantage of the patients, in
that they did not apprise them of their rights to leave the
hospital. On being admitted to the ward, some patients felt as
I did that they could not possibly get well in such an environment,
and attempted to leave. By law, in cases where there is
no court commitment, the veteran can make known his intention
to leave, and within twenty-four hours the hospital authorities
must release him. Sometimes the veteran does not know this,
and in cases where he does, the staff sometimes will start court
proceedings to keep him there.


An incident occurred that attested to the substandard conditions
of the hospital. One of the attendants on my ward got
sick, and as he was a veteran his family tried to get a bed here
for him. He did not want any part of this hospital, and chose
to go to the state hospital at Crownsville. Now veterans hospitals

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The doctor in charge was a resident who had not completed
his training, and although he was pleasant, he also was firmly
convinced that already he was a top-notch psychiatrist. There
was an older psychiatrist who practiced in Washington and came
in from time to time to consult with him on the patients. I had
no confidence in the resident, because he constantly changed his
mind about the disposition of my case.


In the afternoon we met in a group to discuss our problems.
This was known as group therapy. Fifteen of us met for an
hour under the doctor's supervision; there was an exchange
of ideas, and we attempted to work through our problems.
After Dr. Bill's private sessions with me, this group-therapy paled
in comparison as the moon does to the sun. There was nothing
for me to do but stick it out and show the doctor that I thought
rationally and lucidly.


I had been given permission to make one call a day to my
home. More often than not, when I did call, Mary was not
interested or was busy doing something else; and one day I got
the impression that she wanted to hang up.


The nights were terrible. I thought of Mary constantly and
wondered what she was doing. I paced the halls for hours,
which was not good for my medical report. This kind of action
resulted in being given more and more drugs. I could imagine
all types of things concerning Mary and what she was doing.
Whatever she did, she evidently was not doing it with me.


The Government paid some of the veterans whose illnesses
were service connected, and a large share of the patients' money
came to the reservation finance center, where it stayed and
accumulated till death, when the money would go to the nearest
relative. Some of these veterans had been here since the First
World War.


There was a cemetery on the reservation, and from time to

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A lot of the patients had given up and made no effort to
do anything but sit. Some of them had to be forced to bathe
and eat. The closed ward was full of pathetic humanity. They
were kept on drugs so they could not cause trouble. Most of
them had no homes to go to or were unwanted by their relatives.
I said, "A pox upon their relatives," who were waiting for these
men to die in order to spend the money they had accumulated
over the years here.


There was a movie on the reservation, and twice a week we
were escorted to see old-run films. One night while attending a
movie, a patient escaped, and to my knowledge was not heard
from again. Once back on the ward, the boys celebrated and
toasted the escape with Coca-Colas and wished him Godspeed.
Security measures were tightened after that, and the attendants
watched the patients like hawks.


I had now reached the point where I was mad at the world,
and there was no joy in my life. Mother and Dad wrote encouraging
letters, but they were really unaware at that time that they
could have come to the hospital and taken me out. I was also
unaware of this fact, too.


Dad was trying to work with my wife on the matter, and,
being the kind of gentleman he is, he wanted to work out a
solution that was satisfactory to everyone concerned. He
counseled patience, but I would have none of it. One way or
the other, I was going to get out.


On Easter Sunday my parents arrived, and seeing me caged
in on the porch, Mother cried. They talked with the doctors
about me, for they were very discouraged when they saw how
much weight I had lost. After one look at the place, Mother
was all for spiriting me away, but Dad wanted to arrange it
legally, and Mary was still my trustee and guardian.


I conveyed to them the possibility of Mary's having a lover,

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I called Mary and told her that my parents were there, and
she asked me if we were coming to Washington. I said no, and
she seemed to be relieved. At that time I don't think she wanted
to see any of my family. Mother and Dad received permission
to take me for a drive, and we drove almost to Philadelphia.
Being away from the hospital helped me immensely, and my
spirits perked up a bit.


Mother and Dad promised to see Mary on their way back
to North Carolina and try to work out an arrangement that was
fair and equitable to all of us. Mother knew Mary no longer
loved me and did her best to comfort me. I felt as if someone
had plunged a knife through my heart and was busily engaged
in twisting it. I was really in a state of shock, as it was inconceivable
to me that Mary would block my attempts to get out of
the hospital.


My parents stopped in Washington and talked with Mary,
but to no satisfactory decision, and left for home. Dad called
me to tell me this, and I was so angry I could have burst. Each
time the door clicked behind me I couldn't understand why she
would leave me to rot.


I was desperate enough to do anything to get out of this
place. During the next week I must have killed her in my
mind a dozen times. The heartbreak in losing her would have
been enough to make me really go nuts, but being locked up
when I didn't have to be, when she could have given me my
freedom, was the last straw. It was as though she deliberately
wanted to get rid of me. If she would not get me out, then I
would kill her and then kill myself. I began to plan my escape,
when the doctor told me that I would be going home to Washington
for the week end.


Mary came to get me on Friday, and we drove silently to
Washington. I swore that I would not go back.


When we arrived home, there was a check from the Air

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After leaving the bank we went home, and when I put some
beer in the icebox, I observed empty bottles of whiskey between
the wall and the icebox. Someone had been doing a lot
of drinking in my home. To my knowledge Mary never drank
alone. I sat down to think. Mary had said, coming home, that
she had put Freddie in the living room some nights. This was
also strange. The children had their own bedrooms. The phone
rang continually, and she answered in very short and seemingly
sly conversations. We went to a party that night, and I pretended
that everything was well and that I was happy. I
had been talking to a friend, with my back turned to Mary,
when suddenly, turning around, I thought I saw an expression
of hate on her face. I found out later that Mary had told people
at the party that I had run away from the hospital. Major George
Hamp had come by the hospital to see me after we left and
knew Mary had come for me. However, no one said anything
about it to me that night. Leaving the party, we traveled back
across the city to our apartment. I made love to her, and while
we were making love she began to cry. She had never done that
before. I lay awake wondering what I should do.


On Saturday morning several people came to the house, one,
a tall man whom she introduced as a girl friend's husband. I
looked at him and made the mental observation that if she were
involved with a man that this would not be her type. Robert
Nixon came also. We had been stationed in England; he was an
old friend and a classmate of my wife. We were drinking beer
and joking when somehow the subject came around to erring
wives, and Robert jokingly told Mary that she had been "giving
it up all over town." I looked at Mary at precisely this moment,
and the doubts of the past months were removed. Her look of
guilt and embarrassment at a shot in the dark thrown jokingly

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She went with me while I got a haircut. Ordinarily she would
wait with me. Today she waited in the drugstore down the
street. When I entered the drugstore, she was in the phone
booth. I felt a violent contraction of my heart, as if it were
being twisted out by the roots.


I had made arrangements to see a private psychiatrist this
week end, just to see how sick I was, and on the way to his
office I remarked to Mary that she was quite beautiful, and
she replied, "And I will use it, too." This was unlike my sweet,
modest wife. I told the doctor everything, and he felt I was not
so sick that I could not come home or go to a private out-patient
clinic. When I came out of the office, Mary had left to go
to the car, and was coming from down the street.


That afternoon before dinner I noticed that Mary had drawn
a picture of a train while doodling during a phone conversation.
I recalled the words of Dr. Bill, that a train was a psychiatric
symbol of death, and I had indeed planned to kill
her this week end. I did not want to, so I would ask her again
to get me out. At dinner I asked her to get me out, and if she
did not want me here, I would go to my parents'. She replied
coldly, "Not against the advice of the doctor." My doctor had
already seen the disinterest that she showed in my behalf now,
and he was not about to let a patient come to a home where
he was not wanted.


During dinner the phone rang. She answered it and said it
was for me. When I was finished, she wanted to know if that
was my doctor from the veterans' hospital. I thought: Why would
she ask me that unless they had prearranged for him to call?
After dinner I went by Mom's house, and as we were talking
she mentioned that Mary had been there in February, and
Mom had asked about me and why she had not seen me. Mary
had told her she was afraid of me. The pieces were beginning to

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I called Dad from Mom's, and he told me that Mary had said
that she wasn't going to let me come to Washington, or even
North Carolina, for that matter. She gave as the reason that she
was afraid of me. There didn't seem to be any reason for her to
be afraid of me. I had in no way harmed or hurt her physically.
It would appear that she had me by the balls and was squeezing.
There seemed to be no way out of this mess; she was my
next of kin and she didn't want me home. Mary had become
cunning and sly.


I went back home and attempted to talk with her. All communication
between us had broken down, so I went to bed,
deciding that I would have to do it in the morning. I would take
the children to Mom's and then kill myself after dispatching
Mary. I was the first to awaken on Sunday, and I began to prowl
around the house, thinking of ways to end her life. I decided
against throttling her, because I didn't want any noise. My
glance fell among the whiskey bottles that she had hidden
away. I picked a bottle of Scotch. She didn't drink Scotch
and neither did I, when we drank more than a year ago. Her
lover's brand, no doubt. I would use the bottle as a club.


Mary awakened, and the first thing she did was to call the
bus station to find out the schedule of buses to Perrypoint.
It seemed that she was in an awful hurry to get me out of the
house. She was required personally to deliver me back to the
hospital. We ate breakfast; the children were still sleeping.
She stood at the window with her back turned to me, and said,
"Jinx, you have no empathy." Mary had been trying to pick a
fight with me all week end, and I didn't know why until this
moment. If I hit her, she could tell the doctor this, and I would
be locked up for good and all.


I picked up the whiskey bottle and struck her, and she

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dad called the veterans' hospital doctor, who convinced
him that he should bring me back. That was what he had
intended to do. So we went back to the apartment and got my
clothes and went back to his friend's home. While they were
talking, I sneaked out the back door and across an alley, but
Dad, being a deputy sheriff and very athletic, caught up with
me. I pleaded with him, saying that should I be taken back, I
would never get out. He was insistent, so we went to the bus
station where I again eluded him.


I spent the night at Sam Peet's home. The next morning the
police came. Dad had told Mary that I had gotten away from
him. She proved shrewd. She knew all my friends, and it was a
simple matter to find me.


I was taken to jail and booked. From there I was taken downtown
to be photographed and fingerprinted, just as in criminal

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The cell door clanged behind me, and I made up my bed and
lay down. Soon it was lunchtime and the food they served was
enough to make a man sick. It was slop. I was sitting there thinking
I needed some luck when the guard came and asked me
to get my things. I had been bailed out by my father's friend.
I went from the jail to the municipal courthouse, signed the
necessary papers, and called Dad. I went back to the apartment
and stayed there. John, Sr., had taken Mary and the children
home to Virginia. Later that night the police were summoned by
some meddling neighbors who had heard me in the apartment.
When they had checked and found that I was out of jail on
bond, they left.


The phone rang a number of times during the evening.
Every time I answered it, the party would hang up. At ten
thirty the door bell rang. I jerked the door open and a very
handsome man, slightly taller than I, stood there. He seemed
startled. He said, "Is Mary Red in?" I invited him in and
asked him to join me in a drink. He asked for Scotch. I didn't
have time to think about him or why he had come, as I was
busy telephoning friends up and down the East Coast trying to
raise some money, for I had none. I was successful in raising
one hundred and fifty dollars from friends in Philadelphia.

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I came back to the apartment and tried to think. At four
o'clock the phone rang, and I picked it up. A male voice,
evidently disguised, said, "Mister Red," and hung up. The plot
had thickened. Mary, it would seem, had been entertaining
men in the house—my home.


Next morning the money came and I was going home by
plane—the first time in five years. Dad met me at the airport.
We rushed to the bank, but, as fortune would have it, Mary
had sent the bankbook to the bank and was withdrawing the
money. I arrived just in the nick of time. I explained my position
to the manager. He had heard from the Air Force about my
condition, so he let me have the money—seven thousand dollars.
I had saved a lot in five years on my Air Force salary.


I was required to be back in Washington in three days to
stand trial for assault. Mother and Dad had tried to get Mary
to drop the charge, but she wouldn't. Any way I looked at it, the
fact of previous mental illness coupled with assault meant being
locked up. At this point it would mean a commitment by a
judge, and a release only when the doctors gave the word,
which might be never. Our wonderful marriage had come to this.
Well, I would be damned before I would go back to a hospital
and just sit there, while Mary had her freedom and lived on my
pension.


Since she would not drop the charge, I decided to go to
Virginia and finish what I had almost done in Washington. I
went to Danville, Virginia, fifty miles from my home, and

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I left for Hampton, Virginia, by bus. I thought of getting
off the bus and ending it all right there. If I did that, Mary
would still be living and kicking up her heels. My head felt like
a rock; I could hardly hold it up. Slowly the miles ticked away
as I passed scenery that was familiar. I had traveled this highway
many times as a boy, going to my uncle's farm in Virginia.
I lay down at the back of the bus to rest, as I was finding it
extremely difficult to hold myself upright. In addition to the
lead-weight feeling, my muscles had begun to twitch, and all the
hair on my head hurt. In six hours I was in Hampton. I checked
into a Negro motel, unpacked, loaded the revolver, and got a
taxi to carry me to the campus where Mary lived with her
father.


The cabbie drove around the campus, but I did not see the
new car she had recently purchased. There was no sign of
activity in the Johnson household. I would wait until dinnertime.
She would be home to feed the kids. I would wait until after
dinner, and do it then. I hoped John, Sr., would not be there.
I did not want to kill him too, but I would if that was the only
way to get at her.


I left the campus and drove around the small town which
was quite familiar to me. I had nothing to do but wait. I had
begged her for my freedom; that way, none of this would have
been necessary. To love her was agony enough, but to be locked
up to boot—that was too much! It seems that a man can kill for
love and freedom in that order, and he has a devil in him that
will commit any crime if the situation is right. I had the cabbie
drive back on the campus, and still I saw no car or activity
at the house. I drove up to the campus chapel, where we had
been married. It had been a hot day, July 24, 1955, and all my
friends were there. I had been quite nervous. The night before
our marriage we had had dinner at the alumni house on the
waterfront, and at that time life was wonderful. Now this would
be where it ended for both of us.

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I passed by her house; there was no car, so I went back to
my motel room and lay down. My head had begun to hurt,
the last few days, and today it was really a corker. I couldn't
relax. I called my friend Jim Whiting, who practiced in Ports-mouth,
and he came over. I told him what I intended to do,
and why. He tried to talk me out of it. He saw there was no
reasoning with me, so he left. I found out later that he went
to Mary and told her, but he didn't give my hiding place
away. When Jim left, I walked to the woods not far away from
the motel and tried the pistol, to insure that it would shoot
properly. The report of the gun echoed back through the woods,
and I thought: What if some son of a bitch gets nosy and calls
the man (police) to see about the noise? I hurried back to my
room and waited for darkness.


Like a thief in the black of night, I approached my estranged
wife's home. Still there was no car, and all the lights were
out. It was too early for them to go to bed. I crawled up on the
high porch and peeped through the windows—not a light or a
sound. They were not at home. I waited until two o'clock, but
nobody came home, so I left. I didn't sleep at all, and waited
the long agonizing hours through. I would try again tomorrow.


The next day I again maintained my vigil, but to no avail.
There was nobody to be seen in or around the house. I had no
way of knowing where she was, although the thought did occur
that she might have returned to Washington. I did not know it
at the time, but as soon as Mary discovered I was out on
bond, she went with the children to a relative's house in New-port
News. Even had I been aware of this, I did not know the
name or the address. Mary knew I meant business, and we were
now mortal enemies—enemies to the death. I waited another
day, and still no one was at the house. I had to appear in court
in Washington the next day, and from all appearances, she
would be there to press the assault charge against me. This
certainly meant an institution. I would waylay her in Washington.
She probably would not stay at the apartment, but if she

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I did not go to court for the hearing, so now I had become
a fugitive from the law. I checked on Mary's uncle's house,
and her cousin's, and still could not find her. I called Dad that
night. He had been in Washington at the hearing and said that
both Mary and her dad were there. A bench warrant had been
issued for my arrest, and the newspapers carried an account of a
dangerous, wife-assaulting lunatic on the loose. I went to the
apartment in a taxi. I found that all the furniture had been
removed. When I didn't show up in court, Mary and her
father had probably decided that her wisest course of action
would be to leave Washington.


I stayed in my room during the day and moved about the city
only at night. In addition to my other experiences, I now realized
what it meant to be a hunted man. One feels that one constantly
has to look over one's shoulder, and every policeman is viewed
as someone looking for you. You begin to feel like an animal,
scrounging around in the dark You are no longer a human
being with dignity, but something offensive to society that has
to be shut up.


Mary, by this time, had gone to Kansas City with the children
to get away from me. Of course, I only learned of this later.
I did not think of her being there. At night I had dreams
of cold, white hands at my throat throttling me, and policemen
arresting me. Dad was urging me to give myself up and
return to the hospital. I tried to explain to him that now it would
be under a court commitment, and he could not get me out.
Nevertheless, he felt that something could be done.


I was still trying to locate Mary one afternoon in one of the
shopping centers when I saw the man who came to my apartment
that night. I reached in my pocket for my revolver, but I
had left it at home. I still had his card and called his office.
In truth, he was a legitimate stockbroker, and had been employed
at the address on the card. Recently he had transferred

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One night I walked to Mary's uncle's house to see if I could
see the car, since I had checked at Hampton and learned that
Mary was out of town. No car was there, so I went around the
corner to a bar that I frequented as a student and ran into Robert
Nixon, Mary's friend. He said he had hoped he would not see
me, as it was his duty to call the police. I explained the
situation, and of course, having liked my wife for years as
a friend, he didn't believe that she was anything but a paragon
of virtue. So I left my erstwhile friend and went to Mom
Hoskins' around the corner. After being there a short time, the
police came to collect me.


I was again taken to the pokey. I had a thousand dollars
on my person, and the arresting officer said he had thought I
would be in California by now. I spent a sleepless night lying on
a steel cot with no pillow, and felt as though my world had come
to an end. It looked as if Mary had won. She wanted to get rid
of me and keep me locked up, and now it was a reality.
I would never get out of the maze of legal entanglements now.


The next morning I was taken to the district jail and again
went through the routine of being examined by the guards and
changing into prison denims. After a thorough search for hidden
drugs was made, I was taken through a maze of corridors
to the main cell block. I was assigned a cell and given clean
linen for my bunk. During the next three days I was transferred
to six different cells.


At night the baseball games were broadcast through the
prison loud-speaker system. We were able to take showers and
shave at the end of each tier of cells every evening. The food
was not pleasant at all, and of a plain variety. Every other man
in the jail was there directly or indirectly because of a woman.

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dad came to see me and tried to comfort me. I was taken to
the visitors' lounge and talked with him through the glass
window. We conversed by phone while watching one another.
I could see the worry in his face. I told him of the gun I had
purchased, and he promised to go to my room and collect it. He
wanted me to know that he and Mother were still with me.
I had to wait two weeks for a hearing and it seemed like a
year.


On Monday morning I was given my money and taken to
court. The judge noted that I had failed to appear for trial,
and though I was still eligible for bond, upon being informed
by a police officer that I had one thousand dollars, he set my
bail too high for me to pay. He was bound legally to give me
bail, but he deliberately set it out of all proportion. He set
it at twenty thousand and I needed another hundred and fifty
dollars to make bail. The district attorney's office informed him
that I was a former mental patient, and that I had a history of
running away from hospitals. When he got through saying that
records showed me to be homicidal and suicidal, he ordered me
committed to the District General Hospital for observation.


That afternoon I was taken to the hospital and interviewed
by three doctors who did not really give me a thorough examination
at all. It was purely cursory. They asked if I had ever
been in a mental institution, and I said no. They then asked
if I had ever had a nervous breakdown, and I said yes. This
wrapped it up. I had been ill before, and I recently beat my
wife, and that made me a madman. I tried to explain that,
even if I had never been sick, under the same circumstances
I would have beaten her.


I spent two weeks waiting to be shipped to the Federal
Hospital in Washington—St. Elizabeth's for patients with neurological
disorders. I had no idea what lay ahead. I was taken
to the maximum security building of the hospital—John Howard

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The lobby was pleasing to the eye, but there the similarity
with any hospital that I had seen or worked in ended. Attendants
dressed in blue uniforms were behind a glass door that
was bulletproof and shatterproof. Through this door, with chains
around my waist and attached to the wrist, I was taken down
corridors that were separated at intervals by steel doors.
Finally we came to an elevator and went up to the sixth floor,
to Ward 1. It was at the rear of the building, and you could see
the recreation yard from the Day Room and the hospital graveyard
from the nurses' station. The only thing pleasant about this
ward was the smell. The dining room was at the end of the
corridor. The chains were taken off my wrist and now I could
move my arms. The two Negro attendants were pleasant and
kind, and continued to be for the next six months that I stayed
here. I was taken to a room with one bed and one chair in it.
The bars were square and gave the appearance of windowpanes.
The food was excellent, and you could eat all you
wanted—not like the swill they fed you in jail. The Day Room
was composed of two large rooms with an opening to a porch.
The seats were of the heavy wooden variety—the kind impossible
to pick up. Again there were more Negroes than whites.


The inmates were of the tough variety. They were here for
murder, rape, bad checks, shotgun slayings, and so on, and
when they got too tough to handle in prison, they were sent
here. Tranquilizers took all the violence out of them. Some
of the patients just sat and others walked for miles, pacing
around in circles and up and down the corridors. I was among
those who sat; in fact, I now had a relapse and just lay down.
I was taken from my room and placed in the nude in a room with
nothing but a mat on the floor. Dr. Kling, chief of maximum
security, came to see me, and said, "You are a sick man."
Couldn't those idiots realize that a well man would be sick if he
were manacled, locked up, and doped up with drugs? By this

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I gave up now for good and all; the days were meaningless,
and I did not even keep track of time. Week ends were like
weekdays, and there was no change in the monotony. For the
first two weeks I did not have to go downstairs in the afternoon
for yard recreation. After that, I was forced to go. I could hardly
walk up and down the steps. By the time I got down to the yard,
I collapsed on a wooden bench and stayed there till it was time
to come back to the ward.


Every mealtime the broken humanity had to sit and wait till
all the silver was counted, and in the hot, humid environment
of the ward and kitchen, one could almost know what hell must
be like. One of the patients paced in endless circles all day long,
saying, "Kill your ass." I never found out whom he was killing,
as he would only repeat those words. But someone in this world
truly had a mortal enemy.


I was walking down the hallway one day when suddenly I
was pounced upon and pummeled severely. The attendants
broke it up and the doctor came on the ward. The fellow who
attacked me said he didn't like the way I was looking at him.
The doctor explained that he was paranoid and felt persecuted.
I looked at his black skin and knew for a fact that he had been
all his life.


There was another patient incarcerated for the murder of
his girl friend, and he kept saying, "I should have killed
myself." He thought of his first wife continually. He had long
been separated from her, but undoubtedly still loved her. A
second episode of unfaithfulness on the part of his girl friend
caused him to turn executioner.

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What twisted roads fate can travell What irony it was to be
here and think of one's wife and family during all the hours of
one's waking state! There were no books to read and absolutely
nothing to do but sit and think. There was a character on the
wall called the sheriff, who had a bugle and guitar. I had played
the trumpet many years ago in college, and I spent hours playing
his bugle. I told the attendants my side of the tale, and
being familiar with the kind of town Washington is, and especially
Negro Washington, they believed my story of infidelity
and of my wife setting me up to get rid of me. Sometimes I
was sorry I had told them, because of the unmerciful teasing
I got from one of the attendants. He assured me that my wife's
lover must have been a "peter pusher." He also asked me what
could I expect after three or four years with a pretty girl. He
pointed out that half of the men in there were there directly or
indirectly because of some woman. They had either killed one,
stolen for one, or been driven insane by one.


I was looking at a funeral procession from my window one
day when the attendant said, "Doc, you can get out of here one
of two ways—you walk out the front door, or you are carried
out just like that." What a gruesome thought! Indeed some of
these men would be here till they died. There was one deranged
vegetable on the ward who had previously been subjected to a
frontal lobotomy that had left him entirely in another world.
Lobotomies are not done anymore, but the idea that he had
no control over the operations he was subjected to left one numb.
All of the patients on this ward were subjected to massive doses
of tranquinzers to keep them passive. The ward was small and
overcrowded, so the authorities found it necessary to keep the
patients as tranquil as possible. As for me, I couldn't move, I
was so drugged.


After being here about three weeks, I was given a physical
examination with X-rays and blood tests. Another three weeks
passed before I was given the psychological tests of the same
kind I had taken so many tunes before. I saw the social worker
once and tried to get her to contact my wife so the charges would

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The psychiatrists came to the ward about once a week, and
as far as I could detect nothing was done for the patients except
the giving of medication to keep things quiet and orderly on
the ward. Men truly are social animals, and the patients here
endeavored to share their past experiences with one another,
and talked over their various problems with each other. It
seemed I would serve a life sentence for striking a woman. Perhaps
the white man did not fully appreciate the cunning and
shrewdness of the female. It seemed as if all a pretty Negro
woman had to do was to cross her legs in front of the district
attorney and say, "My husband beat me," and the accused one
automatically went to jail. Shakespeare points out that when
a woman is seduced by another man, she will turn on her husband
and want to kill him. Perhaps that is what the dream of
cold, white hands choking me meant. Perhaps Mary was theoretically
killing me; if not in fact actually doing the deed.


Over a year ago I had dreams of Mary being attacked by
two snakes; and after that jails and mental institutions for me.
The snake in psychiatric jargon represents the phallic symbol,
and Mary was under the influence of two men—her father and
her lover. I had spoken with Mary's father by phone after I had
beaten her, and I told him why I had. He told me that Mary
was his daughter, and would do anything he told her to do.
It probably appeared to John, Sr., and the rest of the relatives
that I would not be "right" again, so the best thing for me was
the hospital. Since she now had another love interest, it proved
easy for her to rationalize me into a mental institution. She had

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The months passed slowly, and there was nothing to do but
sit and wait. I kept asking myself what I was waiting for. During
this period of time I was consumed with hate—hate that was
destructive for me, hate that was vehemently passionate. There
was no reason for my being locked up. I had wanted to go to
another hospital, or home, or some place where I could be
treated properly. The doctors were unanimous in saying that I
was sick, yet nothing was being done for me except drugging
me to death.


The Reverend Mr. Hester, home on vacation from Los
Angeles, came to see me. We were not allowed visitors other
than one's family and the clergy. I told him the events of the
past months, and I could see genuine sorrow in his face for me.
We prayed together and I felt better. There was nothing to do
in this place but pray. The Reverend Hester's impression of
this hospital was that of amazed wonder. He said he had no idea
that it would be an impregnable fortress. His impression of me
was that I did not show the strain that I was under physically,
but the hate in my soul for Mary was readily detectable. He
warned me that I had to come to grips with this terrible destructive
force so that my inner being could be free. We talked of
the past and of the future; and, at this point, he knew there
was hope for me. I could not see any, but he did. The body was
well, but the mind was sick.


I suppose the doctors were wise enough to see the love that
had become perverted with hate. I complained to Fred of the
hardship that I had endured the last year and a half, and it just
didn't seem fair that I should be incarcerated with the possible
likelihood of not getting out. True, I had beaten my wife and
felt justified in doing so. She was my only way out of that pig
sty of a veterans' hospital in Perrypoint She absolutely refused
to cooperate and had deliberately lied about me. It appeared
grossly unfair. The breakup of a marriage was difficult when

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dad had told me that I had given her a club to whip me
with when I beat her, and it was true. She had wanted an
excuse to get rid of me. Now she had me locked up and was
receiving my retired pay to boot. What a "nigger mess" I was
in! I guess I stayed too long at the military hospital, and she
got tired of waiting, especially with her father convincing her
that I wouldn't get well, and she so young. He probably felt the
time had come to make the break.


I said good-bye to Fred and went upstairs and looked through
the window in time to see him join his wife. I yelled at her and
wished them a pleasant journey. The authorities would not let
her come up to see me. Chicken-shit doctors and hospitals! I
was sick of them! I had not even received a thorough examination
since I had been there. What if there was a blood dot resulting
from the blow to my head last year? These sons of
bitches talked to you for fifteen minutes and diagnosed you completely.
It sounded impossible, but that's the way it's done. I
was now in so deep that it seemed impossible to extricate myself.
I had, in truth, dug an enormous pit for myself.


There was nothing to do on the ward but sit and watch
television till ten o'clock at night. There were no books to read
and nothing whatever to do to occupy the long days and even
longer nights when sleep would not come. The week ends were
especially long, with no trips to the yard to break the monotony.
I tried to see the social worker many times, but could not. The
attendants kept reassuring me that my wife would come and

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was another patient on the ward in straits similar
to mine. He had had a nervous breakdown. His wife had gotten
him out of the hospital, and somehow or other they became
involved in an altercation one day, and the result was that he
was locked up. If I could just get to court, and stand trial, perhaps
the judge would give me a suspended sentence since this
was my first offense. The maximum sentence for assault would
not be more than one year, and the chances were good that
the judge might suspend it.


Now it was possible to petition the court and be heard. So I
got one of the old convicts to show me how to write a writ of
habeas corpus. This document, though crudely worded, was
in effect the same thing that a lawyer would submit to the
court. I fashioned it as best I could and sent it to the clerk
of the municipal court. At that time the doctors would permit
patients to file as many writs as they liked. In later months,
the number was reduced to two. The district attorney's office
had complained to the hospital authorities that an excessive
number of these writs was working a hardship on bis office.
The hospital naturally complied with this request and limited
the number of writs that could be sent to the court. I waited
a long two weeks before hearing from the clerk of the court.
The hearing was set for a month later.


Every day after eating we would be taken to the yard for
exercise. I had now formed the habit of walking around the
baseball field for as long as I could, and then going over to the
wooden benches and lying down to rest. The rest of the inmates,
approximately three hundred, would play softball, basketball,
and walk, sit, lie around, or talk. In retrospect, I did meet some
interesting characters in the yard. There were murderers, military
deserters, assaulters, thieves, thugs, and criminals of every
conceivable type. The inmates, as one man pointed out, referred

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was every inmate's ambition, except those up for murder,
to want to go to court and stand trial, and get a fixed limit of
time to serve. One could look forward to getting out one day
by this method. The other way, that of waiting in the hospital
till one was completely well and then being tried for his crime,
was an indefinite one. On one of my jaunts around the yard, I
met the Air Force corpsman who had killed his wife when I
was a patient at Andrews Air Force Base. The insurance company
had even paid him the money that was carried on his wife's
life. He had been acquitted by reason of insanity, and sent
to the John Howard Pavilion. He was now angling to be sent
to the veterans' hospital at Perrypoint, feeling that he could get
out of there faster. Murderers, due to insanity, are kept here
for a long period of time, even though they get well. The public
and the courts don't condone a short sentence for so severe a
crime; and consequently they are kept beyond the time when
they are completely rehabilitated. His crime came under the psychiatric
heading of "an act of love"—killing.


I soon met an inmate from my home town who had been a
senior divinity student. He had killed his girl friend and had
shot a man who was with her at the time. He kept her picture
constantly with him and looked at it frequently. He had been
rejected in love and had killed for it—just as I had almost done.
Now I would kill for revenge. I had to get out of this place so
I could kill her for putting me here in the first place. Everything
was ruined now. Twenty-four years of preparation in
school to do something useful in life, and it ended here. In a
building surrounded by a thirty-foot-high wall. I didn't care if
I was electrocuted or hanged; I had to get her.


I had taken so many drugs over the last year and a half
that I couldn't even daydream now. I had lost the ability to
see a mental image. This occurred one afternoon at Andrews Air
Force Base right after Christmas. I was given some drug and I

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After the exercise period was over, I dragged myself back
up the four flights of steps to the oppression of the ward. There
was nothing to do but walk the hall, up and down, up and down;
and to break the monotony of walking there was television. After
being on this ward for two months, I finally was moved downstairs
to a similar ward, with the exception that the inmates were
not so severely ill. The attendant was a Negro, as most of them
were at John Howard Pavilion, and aside from the fact that
they took no personal interest in the patients, they were nevertheless
kind. That was the saving grace of this institution. The
attendants to a man were friendly and kind; they did not treat
the patients with contempt and were not brutal in any manner.
The thought occurred to me that for once I was proud to be a
Negro. They were just kinder to people than whites. I slept on
the ward with thirty or more patients in the room, and everyone
got along well together. There were no arguments and no
fights. The guys just walked, sat, looked at television, and on
this ward played poker. That was the entire world here—sitting,
walking, watching television, and vegetating. It was enough to
make any well man sick.


Going into the ward today, I heard that we had a distinguished
inmate, John Gold, a businessman. He had been committed
for observation. The fellows said (I do not know how
true it was) that this was the first time in thirty years that he
had shaved himself. I made a mental note that, well or sick,
this rich man would not be here long. He had too much money.
He didn't stay long—about three weeks to a month, and he
was gone. It was interesting to see, while he was there, the

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One day was like all the rest—no change. The week ends were
long and boring, and that was life here—one boring day after
another. My leg muscles had begun to twitch now, and I felt a
constant vibration in my legs that was uncomfortable. The feeling
of a lead weight on me was beginning to leave now, only
to be replaced by vibrations. One symptom replaced another—
wouldn't there be any end to this? However, "God does not
put on us more than we can bear." Of all the biblical quotations,
I believe in this one the most. A month soon passed, and it was
my turn to go to court to give an account of my actions. It was
also the hospital authorities' turn to show cause why I should
not be released from the institution. The fellows on the ward had
a major celebration every time one of them had a chance to go
to court. Some of them got out by this method, and this was my
chance to "hit the streets."


The next morning I was manacled with a chain around my
waist that ran through steel hooks attached to two leather handcuffs.
I was taken to the waiting van outside the hospital by
an attendant, and through the city streets to the courthouse.
Even this was a welcome change from the routine of the ward.
We were taken to the municipal courthouse and down to the
cells in the basement, where the chains were removed. This was
an extremely humiliating experience. One was treated like a
vicious criminal, not like a sick person. We were kept for about
an hour, and then carried upstairs in handcuffs by elevator to a
detention cell behind the courtroom. The door was locked and
the cuffs were removed. I cried in the cell. This was like an
Edward G. Robinson movie. This treatment warps a man's
attitude toward law-enforcement officers. Since that time, I have
been on the gangsters' side when watching television. We sat
around on wooden benches waiting for our cases to come up.
Mine didn't come up until after the recess period in the afternoon.

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After the recess period I was taken into the courthouse. One
of the doctors from the hospital was there, one I had not talked
to. In his show-cause statement telling why I should remain
in the hospital, he pointed out that I was dangerous to myself
and others, and that persons' property would be in peril if I
were a free man. A black picture to paint of a man. I told the
judge my story and pointed out the only treatment I was getting
was being locked up, and I would rather take my chances in a
trial for assault. The doctor's testimony won the day, and I
was returned to the John Howard Pavilion in the same manner,
in chains, that I was brought to court.


It had been a change from the monotony of the ward for
one day anyway. I returned to the ward where I was met with
a chorus of "How did you do, Doc?" The chains were removed
and I ate dinner. Each ward had its own dining room, and the
food was sent up on elevators from a central kitchen. On this
ward there were china plates in contrast to the paper ones
on the ward I had just left. On this ward, like the other one,
the doctor made a visit about once a week, and the only treatment
anyone got was tranquilizers. When the doctor did come
to the ward, he spent an average of two to four minutes with
a patient, and then left.


By this time I had seen a lot of doctors of all sorts at work
under a lot of varying conditions, but I had never before seen
such cold attitudes on the part of anyone practicing the healing
arts. The saving grace in this building was the attendants. They
assured me that one day I would get out. There were two
female doctors in residence training on the staff, and I immediately
established rapport with one of them named Dr. Lewis.
I explained my circumstances in detail and she listened sympathetically.
I implored her to take me to her ward. She promised
to try. It was something to look forward to. I felt that, under
her supervision, I would have a better chance to get out if ever
I was going to get out.

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had one more chance with another writ of habeas corpus
to the court. That night I sat down and wrote another, and this
time it would take another month for the damn thing to get to
court. I was hoping that I would appear before another judge
with some knowledge of the problems of the mentally ill. Mother
and Dad, as usual, came for the first-of-the-month visit. This
time they brought Uncle Frank, Dad's brother. Mother was
visibly shaken by the surroundings I was in. Dad promised I
would get out. Uncle Frank said they couldn't hold me here
forever for beating an erring wife. He pointed out that if every
man was put in jail for hitting his wife, a lot of judges would be
in the pokey too. Dad assured me that I would get out, even if
he had to sell his house to do it. This I could not permit. My
brother's blood had gone into the down-payment of this home
for them, and it was all they had. I would not permit this even
if I had to stay here forever. Mother had tears in her eyes when
she left. She told me that Mary was in Kansas City with the
children, at her grandmother's house. No wonder I could not
find her! At this time I still hoped for a reconciliation, and I
wrote Mary and told her that I loved her and the children. I
still received no answer. I was heartsick and broken like a
dry twig. Sick unto death. I did not want to live.


Every day I passed the laundry chute and mentally calculated
that I could go down head first for five stories, and
that should do the trick; but what if it didn't? I could not bear
any more pain. So I would wait and get out and hang that mean
woman up by her heels, and build a small, coal fire under her
head. I would put her eyes out and then cut her lying tongue
out. Because of her I was in this goddam hell-hole of a prison.
The boys on the ward assured me that my wife was having a
ball on my pension. My pension! At this time she had not even
bothered to send me money for a pack of cigarettes, and she
was my trustee. What a cheat she was!


To relieve the monotony, I started to grow a "bloke" mustache.
I had seen many English officers with long, handlebar
mustaches. Mine got to be about four inches long when I was
told to shave it off.

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Inmates on this ward had the privilege of going to the
hospital movie once a week in the hospital auditorium. The
shows were good and very entertaining. Red Cross units would
come from time to time and give a song fest, and other choirs
would come to entertain the poor, unfortunate mental patients.


We also had a dance once a month in the hospital gymnasium.
The female inmates were brought from other parts
of the hospital, and we would have social hour. During one
dance played by the inmates, who, incidentally, had a fine
orchestra, I met a beautiful girl who had been sick for years
and was unwanted by her family. A lot of us seemed to be
in similar circumstances. I might add here that there were no
female inmates at John Howard Pavilion. There were, however,
sissies galore. They would lie around together on the beds, and
it was enough to turn one's stomach. The rest of the guys were
hard on this group of sexual deviates, but they were treated
as a joke by the attendants.


The next time Dr. Lewis came on the ward, she informed me
that she had permission to transfer me to her ward, and as
soon as she had a bed available I would be placed there. Her
ward was one of the few where patients retained a degree of
hope. Patients frequently left her ward to go to other places
in the hospital. I could not leave John Howard Pavilion until
the charges were dropped against me. Mary, however, still held
this ace in the hole and she didn't budge.


I had seen a lot of sick men and usually they demonstrate
their degrees of illness. But for the life of me, I couldn't understand
why most of these men were here. They were as well as
most people on the streets. Apathy on the doctor's part and
public apathy. Even the attendants admitted they had seen much
sicker men released than were on this ward. They said it was
easy to get in here, but hard as hell to get out.


"Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceedingly
small." The endless mountains of paperwork and legal
technicalities kept most of these men here. What a waste of
manpower! There was a man here for stealing two packs of

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The fellows here passed their time mostly by talking of their
sexual conquests in the past and the manner of sexual technique.
A lot of them described acts of oral perversion with women and
told how the ladies utterly thrilled to it. Someone was asked if
he ever indulged in this manner, and he replied, "My wife asked
me to try this once, and I refused." The patients replied that no
wonder he lost his wife. I did not believe that this could account
for any problem in marriage, and I asked Dr. Lewis one day.
She said some women preferred sex in this manner, and some
did it for "kicks." I repeated to the fellows what Dr. Lewis had
told me, and they said, "You're damn right, Doc!" They declared
to a man that he should have lost her if he would not indulge
in this manner. He was advised to get "weak in the hips and
strong in the lips."


On this ward as on the last one there was no reading material
but the Holy Bible, which I read, and read, and reread.
I found a measure of comfort in it. I was so angry with Mary
that I began to send her notes indicating where to find passages
in the Bible describing a whorish woman, and, jealousy being
the rage of a man, he would therefore not spare her in the day
of vengeance. I was counting on the doctor who read my letters
not to take the time to look up the passages in the Bible I
indicated.


At night as I looked out the window I could see the Washington
Monument. I had never taken time as a student to visit
that noble tribute to our first President. In the months to come
I would get sick of the sight of it. At about this time my head
began to feel funny, as though it were itching on top, just
under the bone, and I thought it would be a relief if I could
scratch it there. But, of course, that was impossible. If I could
just lay the bone back and scratch the top of my brain, I knew
it would feel better. That was the feeling, and it was irritating.
I had begun to sleep better, and I felt better when getting up

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There were a few Negro medical-school students doing their
externships this summer, and I became friendly with one. He
brought me news of what was going on at Howard University
and in Negro Washington. My friends in the city were not allowed
to visit me, so the word got out that I was a dangerous,
criminal lunatic. No one could see me but my immediate family.
Not knowing that it was a rule of the hospital, my friends thought
that I must indeed be "off," if no one was allowed to see me.
Dr. Lewis told me that soon there would be a bed available,
and I would be able to go to her ward.


One night at the theater, during a song fest, a fellow slapped
me, saying I was singing in his ear and he didn't like it. I
returned the blow, which floored him, and then I kicked him
while he was down. From this the word got around the
hospital that I could fight, and it would be bad business if anyone
tried to give me a hard time. The reputation did not help
my medical record any, but no one else attempted to abuse
me in any way.


On the first of August I was moved to Dr. Lewis's ward.
A female nurse was on duty there with two daytime attendants.
The attendants were very pleasant and the patients friendly.
The percentage of Negro and white patients was about equal.


It was on this ward that I met a man who changed the course
of my life. We became friendly, and he said to me one day,
"Doc, a man does not fall so low that he cannot rise again."
Through the months of heartbreak and despair I remembered
these words. There were attendants here who knew mutual
friends of mine in the streets; a patient had the feeling of being
helped on this ward. Dr. Lewis spent one hour on the ward
every day. We discussed our problems and grievances, and she
showed both sympathy and empathy. She was a displaced

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Members of the Red Cross came once a week and brought
books for us to read. Some of the other patients had their own
books, and we used them as well. So on this ward, in addition
to sitting, walking and talking, we could play ping-pong and
read and watch television as well. One had to be careful where
one sat, however, as the old-timers had their favorite chairs
and felt that they privately owned them. I made the mistake of
sitting in the wrong chair one day and was soundly cussed out.


My back hurt a lot now, with the most terrible pain, and I
had to complain of it to my doctor. There didn't seem to be anything
to do but take medicine for it. My legs vibrated and the
top of my head itched. I was miserable. No home, no family—
my children had been taken away from me, and I was in prison.


One day a white student from a university was brought into
the hospital for killing his college sweetheart. He paced up
and down, and talked to no one. He had done it with a knife.
An old Negro veteran of the hospital was there, and said, "These
bitches ain't no good. I killed two wives." He was cold, black,
and denied the obvious fact that he was a Negro. He insisted
that his parents were Indians. Even in this old fellow's confused
mind, it was better to be anything than a Negro. The student
was advised by his lawyers not to talk to the authorities. He
followed their instructions to the letter. He could not, however,
keep such anguish and heartbreak to himself. He therefore talked
to the patients who understood how he felt. His girl had rejected
him, and on one occasion had laughed at him. He could
stand it no longer, and in a moment of passion he had lost his
wits and killed her. He was very agitated and obviously sick
with despair and remorse. He had been a student of international
finance and had reached his junior year when the tragedy

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For the first time since I had been committed to this hospital,
arrangements were made for a complete psychological and
physical examination. I had taken so many of the psychological
exams that I could sail through them with my eyes closed. This
one was similar to the ones I had taken in the past, and I finished
rather rapidly, to the examiner's amazement. The results, of
course, were never discussed with the patients. Next, I had a
complete physical by an internist and was given a clean bill
of health. There was no reason for the symptoms that I claimed
to have. The verdict was that it was all psychological; therefore
I was still sick and evidently had many unconscious as well as
conscious problems. I began to think that perhaps all these things
were in my mind. All the examining doctors could not be wrong.
Therefore the fault lay somewhere in me. The question that now
arose was how to resolve these conflicts so I could feel physically
better. I listed all the symptoms I could think of and the heartbreak
that resulted in physical pain in the heart, but could find
no reason for the vibrating feeling and the heaviness that I was
subjected to. Heartbreak, of course, could account for the depression
and apathy. I was sure that the drugs given me contributed
to the leaden feeling, but there was no way to prove it, since I
was required to take the drugs and could not cheat in this area.


We were up every morning at six, and I slept by the window
at the front of the building now. I formed the habit of watching
the staff members and doctors arrive for work. I became so
familiar with the various cars that I even remembered the
license numbers of each one. Dr. Lewis arrived every morning
at eight sharp, and at ten o'clock would come to the ward to
talk to the patients. I spent lots of time talking with her. Before
one could see her, however, one had to sign in with the
attendant, who would give our names to the doctor. Most of
the patients on the ward did not try to see her. These inmates

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Solomon's words rang in my mind: "Jealousy is the rage of a
man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance nor will
he consider any gift." To make matters worse, there was an
attendant on the afternoon shift who was a carbon copy of the
man who came to my house looking for Mary in May. I told
him the circumstances, and he jokingly asked me not to confuse
him with the other man as he was happily married and did not
know my wife. But he served as a constant reminder of that
terrible week end with Mary. I was locked up with a warder
who looked just like my wife's lover. What a stroke of irony!
The gods were being terribly unkind to me.


One of the attendants knew some of my old friends "in the
streets," and we spent hours talking about them. All the attendants
assured me that I was too lucid to be kept here. I would
eventually have to be released, but they warned me not to
talk of my wife too often, as it was a dead give-away to my
future plans. As long as I thought of her the doctors knew
that if I was released I would try to make contact with her,
and this would mean trouble. The doctors were not going to
let any form of trouble out of the hospital.


We had an odd assortment of patients on this ward. There
was Willy, who had stolen a pack of cigarettes and who had a
previous history of mental illness. There were two killers of girl
friends and one wife killer. The bad-check artist was Coleman.
Toby was the old Negro who had been sent from prison for
treatment here. Stevens was the sex pervert. There was one
homosexual, a flaming faggot. One had embezzled company
funds. Another had pulled a street-corner stickup. Smith had run
away from another part of the hospital, so they put him in

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Willy, the cigarette stealer, had been here for a year. He
complained frequently about the grave miscarriage of justice
for one lousy pack of cigarettes. One fellow, who had been
in one of the other domiciliary buildings of the hospital, had
walked away one day. He found a job, and things were going
well with him until his girl got angry at him and turned him
in to the authorities. There were quite a few woman-haters on
this ward. One of the inmates here had been committed for
murdering his wife, and his son for theft.


I thought of my children frequently, and wondered if they
were well, or if they had problems due to a broken home. They
must really be growing now. I had not seen my daughter and
son since May, nor had I heard from them. I tried to get in
touch with Mary's aunt, to explain why I had beaten her, but
she would not come to the hospital to see me.


Dr. Botting, my old dental-school classmate, was on the staff,
and came to see me when he heard I was incarcerated here. He
gave me hope, as he had seen a lot of persons released from
this place. Dr. Bill Williams came with him. He also was on the
staff. He had attended Howard the same time I did. He gave
me two dollars for cigarettes, and I felt better, knowing I had
two friends connected with the hospital.


The doors to the sleeping quarters were kept unlocked on
this ward, in contrast to the locked doors on the others. The
patients had ample opportunities to rest, and I frequently read
in bed. I slept a lot during the day as a form of escape from
the reality of being confined.


Early in the morning we had duty assignments, such as
scrubbing floors, cleaning furniture, dusting, and the like. My
job was to clean the doctor's office and polish the metal door
jambs and the metal water fountain. This kept me busy for
only a few minutes, and the rest of my day was spent in reading

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Every two weeks or so the hospital authorities had a "shakedown."
The men were carried to the yard, and all the wards
were searched. This was done to prevent smuggling of knives
or other weapons and whiskey to the men on the wards.


One of the inmates who had killed his wife was constantly
depressed, and kept saying over and over, "Why did she do it?"
and "I should have killed myself too." He had been very much
in love with her. His job had kept him away from home frequently,
and when he came home unexpectedly and discovered
his wife with another man in a compromising position, he proceeded
to dispatch them forthwith. The courts adjudged him
temporarily insane, and charged that the act was committed
while the balance of his mind was disturbed.


My friend the divinity student kept his girl friend's picture
with him constantly, and often looked at it and wept. He had
loved her very deeply—so much, in fact, that he would rather
see her dead than think of her with someone else. Love is
indeed a most powerful factor in evoking murder. The pain of
heartbreak is a sickness like unto death, for in addition to the
despair and depression one feels, there is a most terrible ache
in the heart. The acute physical pain that accompanies this
causes torture and agony to mind and body. Very often in these
cases a person commits suicide to escape the constant agony.
Murder done under these conditions is not killing in anger,
rather, it is born of depression, despair and the sickness of
mind caused by rejection by a loved one. A passage in the Bible
sums this up succinctly: "Tho I have the gift of prophecy and
know all hidden truths, unless I have love, I am nothing." Love,
then, is the desire to possess the loved object, and I suspect
that to lose this object results in such emotional upheaval that

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the yard I met a burly, very handsome guy who had
beaten a man to death with his bare fists in a fit of anger. He
had been converted to Christianity and was truly suffering as
a Christian now. There were no Protestant chaplains to my
knowledge in this building, nor were religious services held
here. In this area the Christian faith was woefully inadequate,
and it was interesting to see the vast majority of Negro inmates
embrace the Black Muslim faith. The major appeal, as I saw
it, was to the uneducated black masses who had been the
whites' whipping boys. The Muslims taught strict segregation
of the races, even with a hint of hate, and I have heard Muslim
ministers speak contemptuously of Christianity as a white man's
religion.


By this time I had formed the very bad habit of talking
to myself. This was a habit that would cause a problem with
my progress report. The attendants recorded it as responding
to voices. They did not take the liberty to ask me about it.
They saw me talking to myself and assumed that I was in
fact having auditory hallucinations. Patients who hear things
that are not spoken are obviously sick. It was so recorded on
my medical report, and would turn up again and again to
plague me.


Tony Simmons, the fat attendant on the evening shift, made
life bearable with his constant barrage of jokes. He brought
candy and cigarettes to the patients and magazines for them to
read. In fact, he started the rest of the personnel doing it. I
have previously pointed out the kindness of the personnel in
this hospital. I did not see one instance of brutal treatment or

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The nights were especially long for me. There was nothing
at all to do after dinner. One had the feeling of waiting eternally
-~-and waiting for what? We kept the television set going
constantly, and I memorized the entire week's television schedule
from morning to night. The most popular television program
was "The Untouchables," and we took great delight in being
on the side of the criminals.


I got sick and tired of the color khaki. We all wore khaki
shirts and pants. Most of the patients had their own shoes. Those
who didn't wore the work variety. I counted every cross bar
on the windows of the west side of the hospital to relieve the
monotony. I also counted all the flowers around the building
that my line of vision permitted me to see. There were hundreds
of graves in the hospital cemetery—all with headstones. One
either walked out through the front gate, or was someday carried
to the cemetery.


At night we could see across the city where the twinkling
lights looked very much like stars. The airplane traffic lanes
to the Washington International Airport were also visible, and
we stood for hours counting the planes as they skimmed through
the skies coming in for a landing. The fellows all complained
of feelings of loneliness and emptiness while watching the city
at night. People were "in the streets" free, living, working, and
loving. They were going to parties and having meaningful
experiences. We were cut off from these things and it made one
different, so much so that one became indifferent even to life.


Routine soon developed into firm habit patterns: ping-pong,

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dad felt I needed the services of a good lawyer, so he
arranged for a friend of the family who practiced in Washington
to intercede with the courts and the district attorney's office.


As long as the charge of assault was pending against me, I
could not be released from maximum security. He had a long
talk with me, and as he had defended many mental cases, he
was convinced that I shouldn't be confined here. He said it was
up to me to convince the hospital authorities that I was well
enough to be released. He questioned me and requestioned me
for hours, and he believed I was lucid and could help him in
my defense. Many of the patients were labeled; so they were
supposed to be unable to assist in their defense and understand
the proceedings against them, which was untrue.


There was one famous mental patient on our ward who
changed the course of legal history as it affects the mentally ill
who commit a crime. His name was Monty Durham, and the law
affecting the mentally ill involved in criminal cases was named
for him. It was called the "Durham Rule." He was not sick so far
as I could see, and he soon was transferred to another part of
the hospital. This meant that he was on his way out of the
institution.


Dr. Owe had been made chief of this service now, and one
day I talked with him and asked him about my release. I wanted
to know if he had received any action on my last writ of habeas
corpus. He said he had not, and that I was not well enough
to be released. I asked him why, and he said I was only competent
due to the drugs. I asked him what would hinder me from
taking the drugs as diabetic and heart patients do to stay alive.

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was September now—1960—and the hot, humid weather
was almost over; it was more comfortable on the ward. All
summer long we had steamed like pancakes on a griddle. On
my birthday, the seventeenth of September, I received a card
from my children, and Mary had scribbled on it, "Send me
some money, Daddy," and had signed the children's names.


Dr. Lewis told me that she had had a phone call from Mary
while she was on a trip to Washington, and she had sounded
confused. Dr. Lewis told her that she sounded confused. She
had asked the doctor if I wanted to see her. I replied that she
was fishing for information. She could have come to see me
while she was in Washington if she had wanted to. On the first
of October, my writ brought action. I was to go back to court
the following week and another judge would hear my case this
time. The hospital show-cause statement was an exact duplicate
of the last one that they sent to court.


On the day of my hearing I was again manacled with chains
around my waist and wrists, and driven to the courthouse with
an attendant. I was taken to the cells in the basement, and the
shackles were removed and replaced by handcuffs. I and other
prisoners were again carried upstairs to a detention cell behind
the courtroom, and the handcuffs were removed. My case was
heard in the morning, and when I went into court my lawyer
met me. Mother and Dad were also there.


The judge called the court to order, and my lawyer presented
my case. This time he was armed with scholastic reports
of academic excellence and a complete military dossier, which
showed me to be of excellent character and a hard-working,
conscientious officer. The judge then ordered me to the stand
and questioned me at length. He asked me to present my case in
my own words, which I did. At the conclusion of my testimony,
it was the hospital's turn to defend itself. Several times during
the doctor's testimony the judge interrupted him. Finally the
judge said he need not explain any further. The district attorney

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The judge, being familiar with mental institutions in the District
of Columbia and other states, had little regard for the laws
that kept a well patient at government expense. He ordered the
hospital authorities to release me from an environment of
"criminal lunatics," and ordered the district attorney's office to
drop the charges against me. He told the hospital authorities to
release me outright or transfer me to another part of the hospital
for further treatment, and he meant treatment.


I had won by the grace of God and my parents, and we
celebrated mentally with one another in the courtroom. When I
returned this time to the hospital, I did not go back in chains.
The doctor had ordered the attendant to dispense with them.
We had a big celebration on the ward that night. Every time
one of the fellows got out through legal action, it was a clearcut
victory for the others. It gave them hope.


Before I was released from the John Howard Pavilion, Dr.
Owe was determined, it seemed, to keep me in another section
of the hospital. He arranged for the mental-health commission to
review my record. Again Mother and Dad came up for the
hearing in a meeting room downstairs in the pavilion. The
doctors and psychologists asked me a series of routine questions,
and then said they felt that I should stay in the hospital
a while longer. Mother and Dad did not press for a release
at this time. They wanted me out of John Howard Pavilion. If
they had pressed the issue, I would have been released that
day. Instead, I was committed till such time as the doctors
believed I should be released. However, this meant that I would
not have to stay in the pavilion. I only had to stay long enough
for a bed to be secured for me in another section of the hospital.


Toward the last of November I was transferred to West
Lodge, where an old friend, Dr. Paul Kling, was the chief. West
Lodge was an old dilapidated building, but there were no bars
on the windows. A hospital van came to transfer me to the

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At mealtime we were herded together and marched across
the reservation to the main dining hall. The food was good
and you could get "seconds." The attendants even served you
again if you wanted more food. There were no books on this
ward because the patients had access to the reservation library.


There was a ping-pong table and a television set constantly
on the go. The nurses' station was at the end of the hall. I was
reduced to eight milligrams of stelazine a day now, and my
legs didn't feel so heavy. The weight had been relieved from
my head, and although my back hurt, I felt better than I had
in two years. The charge attendant was a Negro in his fifties,
and he was fatherly to all the patients. This building housed
most of the patients who had been released from the John
Howard Pavilion, but they were locked on an upstairs ward.


My first day on the ward was one of relief. The tension that
had existed among the patients on the previous wards was not
present here. These patients were allowed to he down frequently
on their beds, and most of them did just that I received
permission to make a phone call. I was carried downstairs, from
where I called Dad to let him know that I was out of the prison
environment of the John Howard Pavilion. He was very happy,
and counseled me to stick it out and soon I would be home.


While in the lobby I ran into one of the patients who
had been in the pavilion, and he asked me to get transferred
to his ward. Since I knew a lot of the fellows there, I decided
to ask my doctor, but he refused permission, saying that there

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Kling was kind and fatherly toward me, and worked with
me toward rehabilitation the way Dr. Bill had at the military
base. They did, in fact, know each other, and Dr. Kling consulted
him about my case, Every morning I was up at the crack
of dawn, and the ward was cleaned by the patients before
breakfast. We took the ten-minute walk to the dining hall three
times a day with relish. It was good to stretch one's legs so
often. Now I could look forward to a walk every day. When it
rained or snowed, we went to the basement of our building
and walked through a tunnel underground to the basement of
the dining hall, and from there upstairs to the dining area.


Here all the patients had jobs of one kind or another. They
worked in the dining hall, laundry, library, offices on the grounds,
and in laboratories. I was assigned to the dental clinic. I had
to wait about two weeks before starting work, and I looked
forward to it with happiness. I had an interview with the
hospital dental surgeon, and he promised to put me to work a
week after Christmas. For the first time in two years I began
to entertain the hope of going back to practice. Dr. Kling assured
me that I would practice again.


There were two veteran psychiatrists in this building—Dr.
Kling and Dr. Anders, a Jew and a Negro. There were other
doctors specializing in other fields also on duty.


Patients on this ward could receive visitors other than their
immediate family, and I had my first visit by someone not

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was observed on the new ward, and Dr. Kling decided I
could be trusted to spend the Christmas holidays in the city.
Charles and Louise Parry came to sign me out, and I spent
Christmas with them. They had lived with us while he was a
student at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College.
Once more I began week-end visits to the homes of friends.
However, they had to sign responsibility papers for me each
time.


Mother and Dad came up, and we went Christmas shopping
for the children. I bought Sharon a panda and Freddie an
electric train. I had called Mary and told her where I was, as
I was still in love with her and wanted a reconciliation. My dad
cautioned me not to let her know what I was doing, and to keep
her in the dark about my condition, because he didn't want her
to throw any stumbling blocks in my path. This was good advice,
but I didn't heed it. I felt that I needed her desperately and
somehow could win her back.


That week end I went to a dance given by the Roaring
Twenties Social Club. This was a group of young matrons I
had gone to college with. It was a lovely dance. Most of my
Washington acquaintances were there. My old friend who had
called the police on me was also there. He was now in graduate
school in Chicago and had come home for the Christmas holidays.
I pointedly ignored him. Everyone else seemed happy to
see me. While at the dance I met a beautiful girl and straight-forwardly
told her who I was, where I was, and why. She
promised to visit me and gave me her phone number. This
Christmas was better than the last two. The only symptom I now
had was an aching back, and it really hurt. I called the children

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Butch took me back to the hospital, and I reported to the
nurses' station downstairs. After this formality I went upstairs
to my ward. It had been great to get away for the week end.
Things were looking up for me now.


After the holidays I started work in the dental clinic. Dr.
Botting, my old friend, was employed there, and was second
in command. There were two other Negro dental interns and
the chief of service. The dental hygienist was one of my old
instructors in dental school. It was like old-home week. I had
long since lost my embarrassment at being confined in a mental
hospital.


My duties were to assist the laboratory technician in the
construction of dentures, bridges, and so on. I reported to work
at one o'clock and left at four. The first week I was escorted
to work by an attendant in a van. He also brought me back
at four o'clock. After this trial period, my ward attendant just
unlocked the door, and I walked the three quarters of a mile
to the clinic building.


Working conditions were good and the personnel easy to
get along with. I was under the supervision of the senior dental
technician. I wore a white coat for the first time in a year. I
had been issued a heavy army sweater and a wool army coat
for the winter, and I enjoyed the walks alone and unattended.
With all this freedom to come and go at will I had to resist the
impulse to "run." Some months before I would have taken advantage
of this opportunity. I knew that if I did leave, the only
place to go would be home, and the police would probably
be waiting there by the time I arrived. I decided to stick it out
and get a legal release.


On my way to work one afternoon a girl put her head out
of a window and yelled, "Jinxy Red!" It was a girl from my
home town that I had grown up and gone to school with. She
was employed as a medical laboratory technician. I went to
her office and shared her lunch with her. She gave me some

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Every day after work I stopped at the recreation building
where the patients went for their social visits in the afternoon.
Dances were held there every Thursday night. I did not have
to return to the ward and go to dinner with the rest of the
men. I had been given the privilege of going alone from work.
So I formed the habit of stopping by the recreational lounge
and then going to dinner. I had been in an environment of men
for over a year, but now, all around me, there were "young
tenders," and "old tenders" of every variety, color, shape, and
description.


Wednesday night was movie night. The pictures were shown
in a theater and were approximately a year old by the time
they reached us. We went to the show in groups from each
building, and the fellows made arrangements to meet their
girls there. The hospital authorities took precautions to separate
the sexes by buildings, but the patients found a way to get
around them. This was made obvious by the pregnancies of
the inmates from time to time. The infants in these situations
were taken to foster homes or to relatives till the mother was
released.


Thursday was big dance night. We were grouped together
and escorted to the recreational building. The patients had a
dance band and played well. Other hospital groups of men and
women would arrive, and the party was on. These people enjoyed
themselves and got along well with each other. I never
witnessed an argument. Employees of the recreation-therapy
branch of the hospital supervised the dance, and some of them
were very pretty.


I found that at the end of the work day I was extremely
tired, so I took an hour's nap before getting up to read or to

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One morning as I was getting ready to go to the library,
I had a pretty visitor. It was the girl I met at the Christmas
dance. She was very well shaped and the boys wanted to know,
"Who was that devil, Doc?" We had the pleasant experience
of getting to know each other for several hours. She promised
to come back, and invited me to her apartment for the week
end. She had come, after all. She made me feel very masculine.
When she left, the boys teased me about her. I was reminded
that one "tender" had put me here, but this one would take
me out of this world for sure.


I had found the necessary faith again to continue, and I was
determined to get out and practice dentistry again. I was studying
to take the North Carolina Board examination in June. I
tried to feel out my doctor by telling him this, and his reply
was more than I had hoped for. He said he saw no reason why
I should not be out by that time. This was good news. I called
my parents to tell them what the doctor had said, and everyone
was happy. A target date to look forward to. This was better
than I had hoped for.


Since I was required to have someone come get me every
week end, I had to solve that problem. People are caught up
in their own lives and cannot be relied upon to sacrifice too
much time unless they are paid for it. I had no money, since
Mary didn't send me any. I wrote the Air Force informing them
of this, and evidently they wrote a blistering letter to her, for
soon she started my allowance. I solved the problem of the
visits by having Mom Hoskins' daughter come and get me every
week end, which she did religiously until I was released. The
problems of the mentally ill are many in addition to being sick.
People of the community must open their homes to them, and
employers must give them jobs. Sometimes these are the conditions
to be met before release.


On my visit this week end I went to my old dental school

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My week ends were spent in observing the doctors at work
at the dental college on Friday afternoon. During the evening
old friends gave parties. I usually called my wife every Friday,
to try and interest her in a reconciliation, but so far to no avail.
I usually called late Friday night, as I felt extremely lonely
without her. Talking with the children meant a lot, too.


On several occasions, when I called her, I could detect depression,
and she mentioned suicide once and said she was
sick and should be in a hospital. I had some weeks ago come to
the same conclusion. Mary was a sick girl. No one could have
done what she did unless she were sick. I had lost the feeling
of hate toward her, and knew now that I would do nothing to
hurt her. I must make her believe this somehow. I loved her
and felt that I could not live without her. I was completely
lost, and the ache in my heart was terrible. I must win her back
somehow. My entire future and life were centered around her
and the children.


I met many pretty girls on my week-end visits, but I could
not work up any enthusiasm for them. I found myself comparing
them to Mary, and they suffered by the comparison. I just had
no interest in other women, and wondered continually whether
she was making love to someone. The thought of this almost
killed me.


On Friday night I usually spent some time with Norma, the
girl I had met at the Christmas party. We bowled, went to

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On Saturday I usually ate dinner in the school dining room
with the hospital residents; later the parties began. I also spent
a lot of time at the homes of friends I had been in school with.
I visited a lot and renewed old acquaintances. Some people were
cool to me, but many others were not. The old "crazy" stigma
had become attached to me, and some people still thought of
me in this manner and showed it by their attitude. Others did
not, those with some measure of understanding.


Mom's daughter was a perfect gem. She came for me every
Friday at noon and accompanied me back every Monday morning.
Through rain and snow she persevered, and it was largely
through her efforts that I was able to convince the doctors that
I could integrate into society again. This had to be proved
beyond a shadow of doubt before a patient earned his release.


Work was going along smoothly, and I was pleased to note
that I had not forgotten the many laboratory procedures. One
day I was told not to come to work for some reason that no one
explained to me. I called Dad and he called Dr. Kling, and
the next day I was working again. Another patient worked in
the clinic unit with me. He had been a sophomore in dental
school when I was a senior. He had a nervous breakdown after
he and his wife separated. She would come and get him however,
and he stayed at his home, though no longer sharing the same
bedroom.


When it was time for my next week-end visit, Dr. Kling refused
his permission, saying that I must stay under lock and
key till two attendants from Goldsboro came to take me to the
state hospital in North Carolina. I was shocked and struck dumb
at this. I was almost out of this hospital, yet they were going
to transfer me to another. I would have to begin all over again,
and there was no way of knowing what would happen at a
state hospital in the South. I called Dad and he called my lawyer,

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Kling told me that the superintendent personally stopped
my being transferred. Something, to Dr. kling's knowledge,
that he had never done before. Everyone breathed a sigh of
relief. I had now got Dr. Kling's promise to be released by
June. Red tape had almost fouled me up, as it does many
patients who become snowed under mountains of legal processes
and documents.


Every morning I went to what is known as psychodrama.
It was a theater group of patients under the supervision of a
psychologist, and they acted out their repressions, conflicts, and
problems as in a play. Many patients attended this, and it proved
very interesting. It was a form of group therapy with action
and talk as its chief components. It did wonders for some of the
patients. They acted out their anger, hostilities, loves, and frustrations,
which made them feel better, since they could thus
channelize their release of tension and energy. It was a little
theater group of patients who actually performed plays. The
action was spontaneous and unrehearsed, and the patients relived
scenes from their lives as they remembered them, and
the psychologist interpreted the action and motives that caused
these drives.


While in psychodrama one morning, we started a discussion
of dreams and their interpretation. Many of the patients who
had been married related the beginning of their troubles to a
period of time when they had dreams of a black person or black
shadow attacking them. I told some of my dreams, especially
the one about being attacked by a black man, and some of
them had had a similar experience. One attendant had had a

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The friends who remained loyal to me during this crisis
were many, and not a few of them brought me gifts, and
opened their homes to me. Some of them gave me money when
they saw me in the city; others seemed to be quite embarrassed.
I had now come to the point of chalking it up to lack of
understanding on the part of those who rebuffed me. They
evidently clung tenaciously to the old stigma of the crazy person,
while those who accepted me understood that the mentally ill
were like any other sick persons who required time, treatment,
and love for rehabilitation. I frequently was brought food and
invited to dances and parties.


I was in fact invited by one of the Negro dentists on the
staff to attend the African Ambassadors' Ball. This affair was
given by the American friends of Ghana. I called Mary and
told her about it, and explained that I would like her to go
with me. As I was still her husband, I believed she would come.
She replied that one should even go to Africa with one's husband,
but that she could not come. I had met people who had seen
her in New York and Washington since I was put in the John
Howard Pavilion, but she had made no effort to contact me.

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I took Norma to the dance, and saw an old classmate of mine
who was talking to someone he regarded as important. I greeted
him warmly, but he responded coldly but politely, with no
effort to be friendly. This rebuff hurt me, since I was well known
to him, and we had been close. People change, however. He
had become a social climber, and I was no longer a doctor, but
an inmate of a mental institution. I was no longer the popular
fellow who was acceptable on all social occasions. To some
I was viewed as crazy, and to others, sick. Either way one
looked at it, I was not quite acceptable. There were many
people I knew at the dance, and old girl friends by the score.
I had loads of fun dancing with them, and Norma was quite
charming. We were dressed formally and, I thought, looked
elegant. After the dance we were entertained by friends at a
restaurant, and the food was excellent.


Norma and I began a love affair, but my heart was not in it.
I did not want to hurt her, but nevertheless I was human and
needed love. She said she understood that I loved my wife,
and knew she could not fill the void that her absence made.
She was lonely, too, and needed love and affection. She found
me affectionate and generous, and she needed these things along
with the understanding that I had accumulated over the past
two years. She was a charming companion and very nicely
filled the void in my life at that time.


The next day I called an old friend, a girl I had known in
college. I suggested coming to visit her, as I had nothing to do,
but she vetoed the idea. I wondered why, and asked some of
my friends about her. They informed me that she had been

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For the first time during my illness I did not feel dejected
and depressed when I returned to the hospital after the week
end. Each week was another step toward getting out for good.
I looked forward to the beginning of the work week with great
anticipation. For the first time in two and one-half years, the
time had begun to fairly fly. I was busy at the psychodrama
in the morning, then lunch, and I then worked from one o'clock
till four. An hour was set aside for socializing in the late afternoon.
A dance and movie once a week and then to the city
on Friday, made the time pass rapidly. I enjoyed working very
much. The staff made it so pleasant, and Dr. Botting kept the
clinic in stitches with his marvelous sense of humor. All the old
procedures had gradually come back, and I was quite proficient
in this phase of dentistry. I wanted to try my skill on some
of the patients, but I wasn't allowed.


My father, in the meantime, had kept up the payments for
me in California, where I was licensed to practice. It didn't
look as though I would ever get there, but I felt that I should
keep my license current, at any rate. I had been studying to
take the North Carolina dental board examination for two
months now, and the old subjects fell right back into place. Dr.
Bill was right. Old procedures are difficult to forget.


Parties were given on the wards once or twice each month.
We decorated the dingy walls with crepe paper and flowers,
made punch and sandwiches, borrowed a record player, and
then invited the girls from the other wards. They would put on
their Sunday best, and with their best foot forward would
come and have a great time. One girl, a very pretty one that
I had met at a dance at Howard Hall, told me that the doctors
had stopped letting her husband come and get her on week
ends because he was using her for sexual purposes and did not

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The character of our ward was called "Old Bill." He was
approximately sixty-five and very distinguished-looking. He had
been here for twenty years. Bill's major complaint was that non-existent
relatives sent him thousands of dollars every month, but
that the hospital authorities would not let him have any of the
money. Aside from these delusions, Bill was quite lucid, and
entertained the ward with his delightful tales.


Most of the patients on my ward were middle-aged persons
who evidently had been patients in the hospital for so long
that they had given up hope. They lay around on the benches,
watched television, ate and slept. This was their daily routine,
week in and week out. They had degenerated mentally and
physically. I was determined that this would not happen to me.
I kept myself busy — going, doing, reading, studying, and
thinking.


I did not know that I was entitled to disability social security
until I was told one day by a patient. I had been totally disabled
for over one year, and was entitled to it for my family. None
of the doctors or social workers had informed me of this. Again
I wondered just what the role of a social worker was. I had
seen only one since I had been here. I went to the Social Security
office on the reservation, and found out that I was eligible
for a substantial stipend from the Government. This amount
along with my pension was enough for any family to live on,
even if I never worked again. Mary had told me that she could
not live on this amount of money. I suppose she wanted maids,
like we had in Europe. It seemed she didn't want to make any
sacrifice.


I thought about and talked about Mary all during this time.
I am positive that I bored my friends to death. They didn't
appear impatient with me or try to discourage my train of
thought about her, however. In retrospect, I find that I was
lucky to have friends like these, and parents to support me in
an illness of this nature. These were people that money, rank,

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was getting tired of wearing khaki clothes all the time,
so I wore the clothes that my parents sent me as much as
possible. I looked like a member of the staff rather than an
inmate. My problems were mostly resolved now except for the
almost constant ache in my back. When working and concentrating
on other things, the pain was not so severe. Other than
this pain, I had relatively few complaints.


My parents were encouraged and felt much more hopeful
about my progress. Dad and Mother tried to describe their
suffering along with me. It was a feeling, they said, of having
someone close die more than once. It felt therefore much worse
than if a loved one died. If this is true, then it is agonizing
for those who love someone mentally ill and constantly observes
him in a depressed and unresponsive condition. If it feels this
way, then perhaps Mary had no longer been able to take the
uncertainty of my condition, and had just given up hope for
me, as I had done many times myself. I could better understand
her position now, and wanted her back more than ever.


The constant agony of patients and the constant effort of
their relatives to relieve it meets with frustration in the relative
when he realizes his efforts are rebuffed. The loved one feels
that he has to be needed and must give. The patient, on the other
hand, can and sometimes does reach a point where he makes
the relative feel his efforts are in vain. This seeming futility of
effort may lead to the rejection of the patient and guilt feelings
in the relatives. Death brings no need for further effort.


The mentally ill require resources of superhuman patience
and endurance in a loved one. Therefore the relative too can
reach the breaking point and give up trying, as my wife had
done.

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It would therefore seem logical that, in order to win Mary
back, I must get out this hospital and prove that I can function
well in the normal environment of work, and face the many
everyday problems that family units are concerned with. I
don't suppose that any woman wants half a man, and that is what
I was for so long. Soon I would be getting out. I would take the
North Carolina board examination and practice there, and perhaps
I could get my family back together. I had hopes, high
hopes. There was too much at stake now for me to lose. I,
like most people, hated to lose. However, winning sometimes
results from having lost before.


My studies were coming along nicely, and everything was
falling back into place. I supplemented my academic reading
by observing the latest techniques in oral surgery and other
subjects that I used routinely in the practice of dentistry. I
visited all my old professors in the medical and dental schools,
and they told me that the present students were not quite as
good as the ones who were in school with me. The reason for
this was that in the last ten years there were more opportunities
opening for Negroes, and other schools were getting the better
students in these new fields. Also that more Negroes were being
accepted in greater numbers in white schools.


Washington had changed quite a bit since I had gone overseas
and returned. While a student here, we could not sit in the
segregated movie houses or be served in restaurants. Job opportunities
were not available to us on the same level as they were
to whites. The work I did as a student was waiting on tables at
the various restaurants and country clubs. Now even these jobs
were filled in some instances by white waitresses. On Christmas
holidays we would work in the post office, earning enough for
Christmas expenses and a trip home. Now I could go almost
anywhere I pleased in the nation's capital. Progress, though
ever so slowly, was being made.


Sometimes on week ends my friends would accompany me to
the various officers' clubs in and near Washington. I had
been issued a retired military identification card, which gave

During this time my wife's sister had moved to Washington
with her family, and I called her one day. She said she had
heard I was being kept by a woman who was in turn being
kept. I did not know the source of her information, but this was
an indication of some of the things that were being said about
me in the city. It did not matter to me anymore what people
thought, good or bad. Those who thought well of me had
supported me, and what the others thought did not matter one
whit. By the time such stories are repeated and passed around,
they lose all semblance of truth and become distorted beyond
all belief.


I had no car in Washington, so I had to rely on friends for
transportation to and from the hospital and around town. They
were always happy to oblige.


From time to time reports would reach the ward that some
couple on the reservation had been discovered making love in
the tunnels we used to get to the dining hall. Frequently, the
homosexual patients on the various wards were discovered in
compromising positions in various places on the reservation.
Efforts were made by the hospital authorities to discourage this
type of thing. Love, however, perverted or true, will strive to
find a way. Lovers, especially on movie and dance nights, found
a way to elude the attendants and sneak into the tunnels to
indulge in what was called "bush therapy."


Many of the patients won their freedom by going to court and
making eloquent pleas. One such person had been with me at
the John Howard Pavilion when I left that concrete prison. He
was sitting in the recreational lounge when I came in one afternoon,
and he spoke to me. I was surprised, as we had considered
him too looney ever to get out. He had won the right
to present his case to the courts, and the judge, surprisingly
enough, had let him "walk the streets." He had come back
today to, as he put it, give the doctors hell.

The recreational hall was a hubbub of activity that evening.
We were being treated to a ballet danced by one of the local
school groups. We were frequently exposed to things of this
type as well as concerts. The hospital endeavored to keep the
patients as well and happy as it was humanly possible to do
under such circumstances.


Each Sunday I endeavored to go to church and give some
kind of gratitude for my doing so well. I had been miraculously
saved from death three times. I had been prevented from visiting
a tragedy on my children and parents; I had even been
exposed to a religious phenomenon or revelation in the form of
dreams. So I continued to go to church, not so much because
of a religious orientation, but rather because of the wisdom
imparted by well-trained ministers. This is probably the best
reason I can think of to study the Holy Scriptures. When
interpreted properly, they can yield a wealth of wisdom for those
who diligently search out the true meaning that these writings
hold for men of understanding. I went to churches of many
denominations, and enjoyed the worship services of all. I could
not contribute to God's creative work as a minister, but I could
use my hands. My gifts lay in that sphere anyway.


A big week end was coming up in a few days. The Huntsmen
were having their annual cabaret. They were a group of
young professional men who had formed this club when they
were in high school. Many of them had gone to school together,
and now they were doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers, and
so on. Each year they held a dance, and the young crowd my
age came from far and wide to attend. This year it was to be held
at the Statler Hotel. I did not invite Mary because she had
proved unresponsive to my letters and phone calls on other
occasions. It was formal, and many people I had not seen for
years were there. I was greeted enthusiastically and felt very
well this evening—no backache, no pains, no depression.


I must be sick, I thought. I spent the whole four hours at the
dance talking to old cronies and old girl friends. I knew just
about everyone there. After the affair, a group of us went to an

Spring was rapidly approaching, and the date of my release
was not far away. Dr. Kling told me that he would have to talk
with my wife before I was released. She was my next of kin,
legally, and he had to have a statement from her. I called her,
and for the first time told her of the doctor's promise to let me
out in June. I explained to her that before this happened he must
talk to her as a matter of record. She promised she would come
to Washington soon to see him. Evidently even now what she
felt and said had a bearing on the disposition of my case.
I hoped she would play it straight with me now. I was tired
of the doctor talking to me privately and then calling in relatives
and talking to them behind closed doors. This had gone
on from the inception of my illness. Misunderstandings could
arise from an error in semantics, I thought, in situations like
these. A wrong word, and my goose was cooked.


I still practiced my hypnotism and had long since become
quite proficient. I had used the boys in maximum security for
guinea pigs, and they enjoyed breaking the monotony with something
new and different. I used the Dave Elman technique
of rapid induction, and I usually induced a trance in from one
to one and one-half minutes. I found that trances were very

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The weeks fairly flew by, and Mary would be here Friday.
Adelade Hoskins, Mom's daughter, was sick, and could not come
to get me this week end. The night before Mary's arrival I was
so full of anxiety that I didn't sleep. On Friday at noon I
dressed and went downstairs to make a phone call. As I
entered the lobby I met Mary coming into the building. She
looked wonderful. I said hello, and kissed her. We sat and
talked for a few minutes, and then Mary went to tell Dr.
Kling's secretary that she was here. She was ushered into Dr.
Kling's office and spent forty-five minutes talking with him. I
was asked to come in, and Dr. Kling began to question me.
He told me that perhaps I had better stay in the hospital longer
than June. It was incredible, this change in his attitude. I was
amazed, and looked at Mary with my mouth open in disbelief
when she began to cry. I knew then that she had told some kind
of lie. I just could not understand what had gone wrong, and
told Dr. Kling how I had been trying to win my wife back.
He said that he had hopes along those lines. Mary and I left the
office, and I walked her to the car. On getting inside, I put my
hand on her leg and she asked me to move it. I didn't have any
money, so I asked her for some. She said she would leave it at her
sister's, who had moved to Washington the month before. I
told her that Adelade was sick and could not come to get me,
and requested that she sign me out for the week end. I said
I would stay at Mom's. She refused, saying she was afraid. She
then produced a three-hundred-dollar income tax form for me
to sign, which I did. The Government owed me three hundred
dollars on my taxes from the previous year. I asked her why
she wouldn't get me out of the hospital and let me go to my

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That afternoon, one of the attendants and I went to Boiling
Field in his car. I drank ten daiquiris and really got loaded. I
came back to the ward and was furious. She would not get
me out of the hospital even for the week end. She did not have
to stay with me. I would stay at Mom's. She was not cooperating
at all. I imagined all sorts of things about her and her
boy friend, if she had one. I knew she was sexed up and
needed love. If she didn't get it from me, she would get it
from someone else. I finally fell into an exhausted sleep.


The next morning one of my friends came to get me, and I
went to Mary's sister's house. She gave me the money that Mary
had left for me. Mary had gone home that morning. She had
not bothered to call. Dr. Green, one of my old dental-school
professors, was there. We chatted about old times, and he
reminded me that I had made an "A" in his class. I called Mom
and Dad and told them of the recent developments. Dad thought
that Mary had lied about me to the doctor. He told me not to
worry, that he and Mother would be up to Washington this
week and have it out with the powers that be. I spent a restless
week with the pressures of the hospital crowding in around
me.


On the week end Dad and Mother came up to get me out for
a visit. While there, Dad and Mother, who were tired of traveling
back and forth, and even more tired of the doctor's oscillation,
demanded my release in their custody and promised to raise holy
hell if it wasn't done. With this firm stand on my parents' part,
the doctor promised to release me in two weeks, in time for
Easter. We were all very happy, and the end was now in
sight.


Dad made me promise that I would not get in touch with
Mary any more. I broke that promise the same night. I called

We left the hospital after I finished packing my clothes.
A nurse, before I left, told me that patients usually have to
come back to the hospital. Dr. Kling had made my parents
promise to bring me back to see him once a month for the next
three months.
