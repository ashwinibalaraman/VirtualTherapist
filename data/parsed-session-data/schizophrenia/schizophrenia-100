She stands in the doorway, naked, her hair up in a sort of
bun, her skin a dark colour, as though smeared with dirty
oil. Her eyes are sunk way back into their sockets.


"Oh Anna," I sigh. "What have you done?"


She stands there like a child who has done something
silly, as I get out of bed and go over to comfort her. My
first thought is that she has rolled herself in the dung in the
barn. I am not angry. I want to take her in my arms and
say that it doesn't matter. But as I draw closer there is a
strange, acrid smell, and behind her on the floor, a trail of
bloody footprints that stretches across the hall from the
bathroom.


I have a sudden vision of Anna having cut herself deliberately,
her womb, which would explain why no blood
shows on her skin. I take her arm and lead her quickly to
the bathroom, dreading what I shall find--visualizing a bath
full of blood. The footprints lead to the bath; but in it there
are only strips of grey material floating in clear water. It

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I scream for Satu. My instantaneous reaction is to feel I
must lift Anna into the bath.


Then Satu opens her door, and the children look up,
awake, and begin to scream. I tell Satu to go back, to look
after them until I return.


I throw on some clothes and rush down the staircase with
Anna. There is blood on the carpet. I imagine perhaps the
barn is ablaze.


But outside is strangely peaceful. The wet grass beside the
porch is a lighter green than the rest, and there are cinders.
I realize later they must have been Anna's clothes, that she
must have rolled out the fire in the wet grass before coming
in and turning on the bath.


We have to run up a rather rocky, sharp-stone path to the
car, and I dread what that will do to Anna's feet: I tell her
to run on the grass verge.


But the windows of the car are dark when I reach it; and
when I open the door clouds of black smoke billow out.
It will be impossible to take her to hospital in it.


The fire seems to have died down: the cushions on the
rear benches are smouldering; the spare red petrol canister
stands in the middle of the floor; without a top. This must
be where it took place.


I get in and pull the fire extinguisher from its brackets,
spray the petrol canister and the benches with the white
powdery mixture. Then I tell Anna to wait on the grass
while I telephone for an ambulance. I have thrown an

[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I knock and go straight in. Mrs Brideson is standing
there over the stove. I ask if I can phone her doctor, there's
been a terrible accident.


She motions to the telephone at the other end of the
room. She tells me the name of the doctor to look up in the
personal telephone directory beside it. I ask the code, she
gives it without moving from the stove, and I dial.


The doctor answers.


I say that my wife has tried to commit suicide and is
burned all over. Can he send an ambulance?


Then I ask which hospital Anna will be taken to. He says
to the cottage hospital.


I hesitate.


"What's the matter with that?" he asks.


I say I know the hospital, have seen it while visiting the
village, but wonder whether it is big enough for an
emergency case like this.


"Well where would you like her to go?" he retorts.


I say I hardly know the area, have only been there four
days. I name the nearest large town I have seen on the map.


"Are you going to argue over where she goes?" he demands;
and I have to give in, apologize, appeal to him only
to get the ambulance up to the farm as quickly as he can.

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm right: the little hospital is not in any way equipped
for such a case. About fifteen minutes elapse before the
ambulance comes, and a further ten while we drive down-hill
to the village. At the hospital Anna is wheeled into the
small dressing-room/theatre; and for the first time I hear
her scream wildly as they attempt to dress her wounds,
particularly her feet. The doctor gives her a pain-killing
injection, and then comes out to me.


We sit in the ante-room, by the main entrance.


He is visibly moved and aware of my own distress. I tell
him how we had come down to the country with a number
of other schizophrenics under Dr Landis, that I hadn't
wanted her to have ECT, that she had apparently emerged
from the psychosis: and then the accident happened.


He says he doesn't care for ECT either, that it is very
seldom used down there. He doesn't think the burns are
deep except on the feet. He is tempted to keep her there,
in the cottage hospital, and to dress them himself, as he
has done with another patient not long ago. I sigh with
relief. I ask how long it will take for the burns to heal
sufficiently for Anna to leave: he says three days: but that
he is going to have her sent to the nearest town as there
is a psychiatric social worker in attendance at the hospital
there.


The ambulance driver comes in to telephone. He asks
the doctor what percentage of burns he should give.
Seventy-five?


The doctor shakes his head. "No, no. Probably not over
fifty."


The doctor draws out his fountain pen, writes a brief
explanatory letter for the casualty officer at the other
hospital, then leaves.

[p. <i>173</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Anna is wheeled back into the ambulance. A volunteer
nurse has arrived by now and she comes with us, giving
Anna constant sips of water on the way. It takes almost an
hour. We stop at Patty's cottage and I rush in, shouting
for her. I tell her what has happened, ask her to try and
get Landis to come to the hospital, as I can't reach him at
the other community cottage. She promises, and I run back
to the ambulance.


At the hospital Anna is wheeled into the casualty department,
and then straight into the small theatre there.
The ambulance driver and the nurse leave--he is the local
postman in the village he tells me, but the letters will have to
be a little late that day--and I sit in the waiting-room
among outpatients with bandaged fingers and swollen legs.
Later I'm asked by a nurse what's the matter with me, and I
explain I'm Anna's husband. She looks a little flustered and
says the casualty officer would like a word with me when
he has finished in theatre.


He comes out eventually, and asks me to go into his
office. He has a serious, methodical face.


His desk is full of forms and sheets of notepaper. He
stands facing them, turning the letter from the cottage
hospital doctor over in his fingers.


"Do you realize how serious it is?" he asks.


I feel a strange, panicky feeling in my stomach and tell
him what the other doctor has assured me, that the burns
aren't deep.


He shakes his head.


"It's very difficult to say at this stage how deep the burns
are. My guess is that they're all deep--"


"Even on the face?"


"Even on the face. We can't tell for several days--for

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It's the first time the notion of death has occurred to me:
my whole body reacts. How can she die when she had been
standing before me, when we ran together up the path?
She had been singing to herself in the bathroom, loud
enough to wake me. No bone was broken and there was
only a little blood from the soles of her feet ...


I step gingerly out and across the corridor, silent. A nurse
gives me a cup of tea from a machine in the waiting-room
there: then I break down completely as the implications
steal through me. A sort of mad internal dialogue seems to
overtake my mind as its rational, everyday imagination suddenly
leaps into time future, while the rest screams with
terror and emotional abandonment.


They clear the room while I sob on the floor, kneeling
against my chair in a kind of prayer, begging that it
shouldn't happen, that they should save Anna.


[2]


I'm allowed to go up as soon as Anna is settled in the ward.
I can't see the consultant then because he is operating--till
six at night.


They have screened off a bed at the end of the ward, a

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00185&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A short, middle-aged nurse in a special white smock is
sitting by Anna: Jane she calls herself.


I have to wear a smock too.


Anna's face looks more peaceful against the white pillow.
She is asleep; a series of tubular angle-brackets hold the
sheets from actually touching the burned flesh. She seems in
no way disfigured, and I marvel at how beautiful she looks,
even though they have cropped her singed hair closer to
her head. Above her hangs the drip-feed.


At lunchtime I go for a walk with Jane; return. Later in
the afternoon Dr Landis comes, and we go out for a coffee
at a nearby cafe. He is wearing his red anorak. For the first
time I feel close to him, almost like a brother, because I'm
distressed, and I need him. I see so clearly Landis's own
problems, his own attempt at integrity, the pressure he's
under every day of his life. I feel him so close I could
almost touch him, his almost saintliness.


When we talk of what has happened, Landis develops his
own interpretation: the significance of fire, the symbol of
clearing, cleansing herself, a kind of resurrection, rebirth,
whereas I see it much more as a moment of confusion,
depression, as the very pit of despair, of self-hate. Guilt
makes me tremble: for not having been able to stop her,
for not having realized how serious her state had become.
I was with her, I was her guardian, Mary Barnes had
warned me: and like Peter I had slept...


The important thing now is to see that Anna gets the

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I ring my father, ask him to find out whether there are
any other steps I can take. Should Anna be transferred to
another hospital, and if so, to which?


At six finally the consultant comes down: a balding,
kindly-faced man in his late fifties or early sixties, stooping
slightly. He shakes his head.


"It's very, very grave," he says quietly behind the
screens. "I don't think she can withstand it. But she's still
a young woman. She's got age on her side."


I sit with Anna all evening. It is arranged that I may sleep
on the empty bed in the corner, so that I can go to her if
she wakes and wants me. She seems to have no idea where
she is or what has happened: only that I'm with her, beside
her bed. Her face has begun to swell as though inflated,
the flesh around the eyes ballooning, so that her eyes seem
long, Burmese.


Stephen arrives at about i am. He has driven over from
the place where he is on holiday with his wife and children.


[3]


From now on I begin to keep the diary I abandoned when
Anna finally "emerged" from her psychosis at the farm.
Though only fragmentary it gives me a feeling at least of
continuity, and acts as a kind of escape valve.

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00187&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If I'm suddenly braked in the struggle for sanity and
growth, if in a medical sense I am now superfluous, am
condemned to watch while the fight becomes one of medicine
against injury, inwardly I feel as though nothing has
changed: the circumstances have merely intensified the
struggle. Previously we have been fighting for sanity, for
a better, more honest marriage, existence; now we are
fighting for life.


Anna's trial becomes my own, just as her madness has
been.

<i>Thursday, 21 June 1973</i>


"Woke about 7. Stephen had not slept--I had heard sound
of nurses turning Anna in my sleep, though. She not awake.
Face still swollen, and wounds now turning from pale to
a garish red where top skin burned or peeled away. Stephen
does not want to look.


"Have breakfast. Intend to leave with Stephen to go and
see children as Anna asleep and heavily sedated. Wait in
car while Stephen tries to phone Bridget. See consultant's
car--decide to go up. He is in Anna's room--wait in main
ward. After a little while he signals I may come over. Seems
very quiet, not willing to say much.


"'Will she live?'I ask.


"He looks at me with his blue eyes that seem to hide in
the shyness of his face and bearing. 'Oh, she could still pull

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00188&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"He departs and I stand by the bed. Suddenly Anna seems
to become conscious. Starts talking--about children etc.
Seems reassured I am there.


"'Are you going away?' she keeps asking.


"'No, I'll be with you--always.' But she gives a little
snort at this. Go on talking with her for about ½-hour.
Then staff nurse insists I ought to go out a little and see
the children, if only for an hour. Leave phone number and
go with Stephen. Mary Barnes and American boy in corridor.
They ask how Anna is. Just seems so hopeless the
moment I am out. When I think of the burns, I burst into
tears again.


"In the village I get a garage mechanic to come and check
the van for safety; but there is no one at the village police
station, so the accident is not reported. At the farm there
are the children. How tell them?


"First Thomas comes out with Satu. Roy Landis there
too with his small daughter. Says has spoken with Gabriel
and told him his mother might die. Mrs Brideson there too.
I apologize for it all having happened like this, that Anna
might die. She chokes back tears when she says yes, she
knows, she is sorry, she was so shocked when it happened,
has since been going over and over it all with her husband.
Says he had seen her outside before he went to milk cows
sometime before 7 am. This surprises me--means I must
only have dozed very briefly, for I remember Anna going
to window in our bedroom when farmer's car left drive; and

[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00189&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Stephen remains with the children at the farm, while I
return to the town.

<i>Friday, 22 June 1973</i>


"Slept 1 am-5 am. Woken--Anna calling me. Nurses
changing sheets and turning Anna. Sat with her--as lucid
as last night--but still thinking <i>I</i> have met with accident.
Don't know whether to tell her. Say she has had some
nasty burns--seems to remember a little--'<i>ach, ja</i>' Sipping
lot of water--good sign. Face still swollen laterally and
mouth/lips enlarged, but colour of face, though still very
grey and red where deep burns run (right side behind
cheeks), somehow looking better. Wounds on forehead
now quite dry. Skin between and below breasts has turned
to black, pungent, bad smell of decayed flesh. Only shoulders,
front and back, seem to have been spared at all. Below
stomach the sight is indescribable--can only think of
pictures of babies in foetus stage, a seemingly transparent
layer of skin under which the red blood and black network
of veins. Horrible, horrible to see. Left leg worse than right.
Skin beginning to dry in 'waves'. Large areas of soles on
feet simply come off--but important thing seems to be

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00190&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Says she cannot move fingers. Nurse says seems they are
in spasm: but yesterday night nurse had helped her flex
them, so I put on gloves and did the same, finger by finger.
They are very stiff, no nails, the palm-sides at the fingertips
very black and charred--something so naked and infant-like
about them--black veins showing in the red and black.


"'You'd have made a very good doctor,' Anna murmurs
--still very, very lucid, aware of all noises about her,
but able only to see a little, eyelids both horribly swollen,
almost to the level of cheeks.


"'The children?' she asks. I tell her where they are, of
Stephen taking them to the sea, how well Gabriel has
taken it ('sharing' me with her as he put it), that they will
be asleep at this hour. Seems not to know where she is.
Explain about the town, not far from farm.


"Very anxious when nurse turns her, wanting me to be
there. Heartbeat reasonably steady at 120.


"'<i>Roy war hier</i> [was Roy here]?' she asks.


"'Yes,' I say, was here last night, that he wants her to live
as much as I do."


How aware Anna is, in a rational sense, of what is happening
is difficult to know. She is on constant morphine
injections, and the pain must be unbelievable. She speaks
repeatedly of "monsters down there" (hand on her chest).
"That's all right," I say. "Oh you're always saying that!"
Anna snaps reproachfully: and I have to observe the finest
of distinctions between comforting and patronizing. The
question, too, of why she did it also rises repeatedly in my
mind--but it seems of such tiny importance in comparison

[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00191&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

[6]


"'Perhaps better not drink too much,' I say when she begins
to cough after a number of sips.


"'Oh, a certain amount of drink releases a certain amount
of thought,' Anna says.


"'Terrible smell,' Anna remarks at one point.


I tell her it is the anti-biotic spray.


"Seems to have short minutes of rest or sleep, then wakes,
calls my name--seems reassured when I answer. If I speak
to nurse over screen thinks I am going to leave her. Must
have heard of the regional hospital, for asks when I shall be
going, as though it would be without her.


"SEN nurse (green) comes to see Anna--one who had
advised transfer on first day--surprised how well Anna
looks. Says went off duty 2 pm yesterday and didn't think
she would see her alive again. Only 1 in 150 survive this
degree of burns. Felt road journey to the regional hospital
too long (4 hours). Senior nursing tutor--a voice like
Miranda's--says only her will to live <i>could</i> have brought
her through to present state.


"Sister asks if she wants porridge--and she takes it from
spoon! Unbelievable only 12 or 24 hours before. Then,
when asked if any special dish she would like, says fish!"

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00192&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I left about 11 am. How different from yesterday at the
same time! The bloated look, the swollen eye sockets falling
back to normal--or nearly normal--depth, the mouth still
blackened around the perimeter of the lips, but somehow
finding their original contour slowly instead of the bloated
tribal orifice . . . Skin on her body much drier, but tips of
fingers ominously black and fingers rigid.


"At farm children quite happy with Stephen. Satu goes
shopping. Stephen plays with Gabriel while Thomas industriously
marches about. Read them story while Stephen
fetches Satu. Pay Mrs Brideson. Find it difficult to 'give'
much to children, though, feel so drained by what has happened.
When I say to Gabriel I want to tell him how
Mummy is, he says no, that will make him too sad. Later
though he whispers in my ear: 'Tell me about the van.'
Seems to have his own or Roy's theory that Anna trying to
burn out something painful in herself--and several times
later says: 'I think it's how I said.' 'She <i>will</i> survive, I think,'
he says to me, 'because she's got much better very quickly.'
With Stephen's encouragement does a picture and some
writing. Arrange Stephen to return to Bridget. My younger
brother Martin to take them to sea again as yesterday.


"Back at hospital Anna lying with eyes open--very much
better--must be the skin drying. Sight of her hands appals
me--feel monumentally tired, finding it hard now to reassure
her. Shortage of nursing staff--Anna worried by nurses,
wants to sit up and see out. Finally nurse Jane takes over
and I sleep fitfully but gratefully for 1½ hours. About 10
pm Martin comes--children had good afternoon and now
asleep. 'Everyone needs Daddy,' Gabriel had said to me at
lunchtime, 'so Stephen and Martin are here instead when
you have to go to Anna because we need a Daddy.' Went

[p. <i>183</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00193&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"'Hello Mr Reed,' he said before I had spoken. Asked him
re burned hands, movement of, etc. Said question of what
areas can be saved, what amount of grafting possible, etc,
can only be determined after 8-10 days; that it is still
question of keeping her alive.


"Afterwards went up to Anna. Had had Valium--
sleeping. Went to bed myself."


[7]


<i>Saturday, 23 June 1973</i>


"Slept from 11.30-ish to 5.25 with constant dreams, occasionally
aware of nurses turning Anna and changing linen.
This time were turning, changing and spraying her--she
seemed to be talking deliriously with occasional clear words
the nurses could understand, but above all doing what they
asked of her. Wanted coffee.


"When I went through the screens to her, faint smile.
Yet her first impulse was to appeal: 'Get me out of here!'


"I asked if she knew where she was and she shrugged.
But when I tried to explain reasons for staying here she
began to cut me short, saying I shouldn't always try to
convince her, that I wouldn't listen to her, etc. 'Get me out
of here,' kept repeating, 'then I can see things from another
perspective.' Has to speak with minimum lip-movement, so

[p. <i>184</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00194&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I asked nurse if Anna had had Valium--said yes, twice
in night. Got her coffee ready. She seemed to calm a little,
though in pain with weight of body tipped onto left arm.
Suddenly seemed to recollect seriousness of her condition.
<i>'Ist's wahr ich habe geschwebt zwisichen Tod und Leben?</i>
[Is it true I was hovering between life and death?]' she
asks.


"Nurse says she had spoken in night of her mother. 'She
would know how to make me better,' she had said--otherwise
confused and delirious, wanting to get out.


"Explain again how serious the burns are, that I've consulted
many doctors about the best time to move her, that
she must trust me there ... Asked also if she'd like her
mother to come over and be with her. 'Yes,' she whispers.


"Asks for something to eat--chicken broth."


<i>6.25 am</i>


"'David--tell me what happened.'


"Begin to tell her--but uncomfortable and put pillow
behind her back. Besides, what should I say that will not
upset her, either now or later? Nurses come to change her
and give her injection, so I went down with Martin who had
come up about 7 am--went with him to hotel to telephone
Anna's mother.


"'<i>Ach, Gott</i>,' she cried when I said <i>how</i> Anna had done

[p. <i>185</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"'Mr Shifting Interest,' she calls me as pain of antibiotic
injections make her wince and cry out. Meanwhile consultant
sees her, seems very pleased, also administrative
sister. Then Anna wanted to be moved. Asked how: said
more upright so that she could see me when I was talking
to sister!


"Seems more and more aware of burn damage, talks of
grafting, whether would be done under anaesthetic, etc.
Sips tea, then as she is no longer comfortable I help Jane to
change drawsheet and lay her down to sleep.


<i>12.45</i>


"She had even eaten a little lunch--mince, mashed potato
and then jelly. Frightened, lips chattering, do not like to
leave her--staff nurse going to sit with her.


"In the corridor downstairs I meet the doctor who had
been on casualty duty the day Anna arrived. He sounds genuinely
if stiffly pleased when I tell him that Anna is sitting,
is eating, and so on. 'But she is not out of the woods yet,'
he warns. 'The grafting process itself brings further dangers

[p. <i>186</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00196&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Only get back from lunch with Jane at three--seems
that Anna had been very uncomfortable--had wrenched
her name-band off--fingers bleeding from that. Staff nurse
grateful to see me--says she had given Valium and morphine,
but evidently not very effective--Anna agitated, a
little feverish, mouth chattering, complaining of pain in the
arm; tells me of name-band problem--had obviously got
very upset at her second name being used as surname on
the tag--thought it signified that we were divorced; and
though she knew this was the case, did not wish to be
reminded by tag! I tell her I had specifically asked yesterday
that it be corrected and that she had herself said she
didn't mind the name.


"'It isn't true what David says,' had been her words
when I'd said how she hated it. Seems tremendously relieved
that I am with her now--'Well, you see, you weren't there!'
she explains her outburst.


"Roy comes around 4. Anna already had more morphine
(i5gms), but still talking and aware. Roy talks to her for
½-hour; then while nurses turn her we go downstairs. Disagree
re danger of her present mental state--R.L. thinks
reaction normal given what has happened--I try to explain
that delirium and loss/fear aspect exactly the same as <i>before</i>
suicide attempt.


"R.L. leaves then--Anna still awake, a lot of pain from
feet. Way she talks bears out Roy's view however--simply
afraid of being left alone without the people she trusts. But
in background is her fear and concern about scandal etc
to my family--she needs constant reassurance and is never
really convinced. Very anxious I not leave her at night.

"Obviously pain/shame etc unbearable and worsening:
'<i>Mon dieu, mon dieu, ich kann nicht mehr</i> [I can't go
on] ...' Extraordinary really that she has been spared
pain--or too much pain--for so long. Obviously now
beginning to activate again."

<i>Sunday, 24. June 1973</i>


I have arranged that Martin will take the children to stay
with some friends of mine. I will travel with Anna in the
ambulance to the Regional Burns Unit.


The ambulance men come up at 8 am, use poles and a
canvas sheet to transfer her to their stretcher-trolley. Most
of the nursing staff in the hospital come to say goodbye--
and good luck.

[p. <i>188</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00198&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Nurse Jane is going with us. She is very responsible, very
efficient, and knows this. Everything goes wrong.


As we are about to leave, an argument develops over the
route we should take. The main control insists we go the
shortest way; Jane insists we travel the long route, avoiding
much hilly country. Instead of four hours the journey now
takes six. Eventually and fortunately I fall asleep; Anna has
had heavy dose of morphine and is not conscious. Inevitably,
out of radio contact, we break down. A puncture: and the
minutes tick by before Anna's sedative wears off.


"And he'd been driving so well!" says Jane.


It seems hours while the driver and his boy-assistant walk
to the nearest house to telephone. Their telephone is out
of order. A passing motorist must be stopped and asked
to dial 999 in the next town. We don't even know where
we are.


By chance an ambulance passes us from the other direction
and our driver hails it. He gets permission to cancel his
call and we transfer Anna's stretcher-trolley to his vehicle.


It begins to rain as we drive through the town. I see
church spires, flyovers, blocks of houses being demolished
for a motorway. Then, a little way out of town, we turn
off a country lane and the ambulance driver reports to the
hospital admission point. There seems only series of elongated
huts, single-storied, like an army camp, and we drive
straight on, following the signs marked "Burns Unit".


We turn left past tall trees; here the buildings have
sloping rather than flat roofs, and are set well apart from
one another. A capped metal chimney smokes above the
operating theatre. We drive past that too until we come to
the ward. There is no one waiting. It is several minutes
before a male orderly appears. Anna is conscious now. It

[p. <i>189</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00199&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The male nurse has a neatly trimmed beard like Anna's
brother Berthold; he wheels her through a series of three-and
four-bed wards till we reach the end of the building,
rather like the last hospital. There is a patient already lying
in this last two-bed room. Despite Anna's critical condition
after the journey it is two hours before a doctor arrives. In
the meantime no morphine can be administered without his
signature. After all the talk about this hospital my heart
sinks.


The doctor is a youngish surgeon, perhaps my own age.
Having seen Anna he asks me into the sister's office. He
apologizes for having been so long--it is a Sunday and he
is the only duty doctor there. He takes down some more
notes, but his cheerfulness seems genuine. He says it is unlikely
they will start doing any skin-grafting operations
until the depth of the burns is revealed, and Anna's condition
improves.


The senior Registrar arrives. He spends only a short time
examining Anna before he comes in. I listen to what he tells
me, but I cannot believe what he says. Later I enter it in
my diary.


"The Registrar declares the chances of recovery small--
so much damage, of such a different nature than fractures
or other form of accident--affecting whole metabolism.


"Roy would say: Anna has surprised us all, and maybe
she still will. But without being self-pitying it is I who must
bear the blame--I who took her out of the mental hospital, I
who knew from the beginning that she was probably too

[p. <i>190</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00200&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I feel sandwiched. I feel utterly exposed to guilt, to
shame, to helplessness, to the absolute despair of having
to watch powerlessly while, as a result of something I can
never change, Anna dies. 'If I had to choose between concentrating
on my children and my wife, it would be the
children,'
the Registrar says--and from the end of the ward
I hear Anna screaming deliriously.


"By evening other patient moved out and the end ward
closed off.


"Probability, to be discussed with consultant tomorrow,
that Anna's hands will be crippled if she lives. 'People have
survived with worse burns,' the Registrar says--but feels it
right to explain that chances are against. Only over initial
shock, stage I--haven't even started tissue problems.


"The second time in five days that a senior surgeon warns
me of the improbability of survival, the second time Anna's
probable death confronts me like the last page of a book
that I do not wish to finish, the second time that somehow,
somehow I must summon again the courage to <i>make</i> Anna
live ... Life without her seems so utterly unthinkable--not
because it is practically impossible, but because her spirit is
so profoundly the measure of it, of life, for me--and for the
children.


"I think of the day she emerged--that morning by the
stream ... so much love, so much goodness and wonder,
so much intelligence and vitality that is hers, hers alone ...


"Went to sleep 10.30-ish."

[p. <i>191</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

[9]


They do not allow me to sleep in Anna's room, despite the
now empty bed, but I am given a room at the far side of the
hospital, about half a mile away.


<i>Monday, 25 June 1973</i>


"Woke shortly after 5 am--came over to ward--Anna
crying out, delirious, no nurse anywhere. Talked with
her, gave her water. Obviously in great pain and agitation
('<i>ich kann nicht mehr, ich kann nicht mehr</i>')--talking of
my elder brother and his wife Sophie, of my father and
mother. 'I don't want anything to do with your family'--
yet how she liked Sophie (nurse later said she had been
talking of Philippines). Had had morphine before midnight
and again at 4.30, but apparently no effect. Also Valium.
Called for Roy, her mother (particularly when in pain).
Waving her arms ('tatty bags' she called them last night,
for they have now been put into plastic bags, and the skin
covered in special cream). Spoke of insecurity--wanted to
go to East Berlin, then spoke of Moscow-Peking. Little Red
Book. Also partition between 'your poetry and German
poetry'. Kept saying name of Christoph Rathgens--her
friend in Munich? Partition = split? the sense of sides?
Throughout psychosis she had spoken of wanting to go, or
having to go to the 'other side'--whether of river in the
country or neighbour's wall ...


"When I say she must want to live she says Yes, she <i>does</i>
want to live--interspersed with '<i>ich kann nicht mehr</i> ...'

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Write to Roy. Other questions so impossible to think
about. And the children? How difficult yesterday to face
their need of me when I carry in my soul the cries and distress
of Anna. And their tears when I stayed here and they
went home.


"Is there hope, I wonder? At the beginning, in the other
hospital, I had to face up to the prospect of Anna's death;
her life has now been saved, only to renew the struggle.
I must keep separate all my own anxieties and feelings of
guilt: they will not help her, they will not help me at this
moment. I have to go on encouraging her to live, that is
all: and in the face of a degree of pain and suffering, I
would have succumbed long ago, I know."


[10]


I stay the night with the children at my friend's house,
about forty-five minutes' drive away. But Anna's condition
meanwhile worsens.

[p. <i>193</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00203&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Tuesday, 26 June 1973</i>


"Woke at 5 am--Thomas awake at 7 am, Gabriel to
school at 9 am--headmistress very nice. Telephoned
London, played with Thomas. Left at 11.20 for hospital.
Mother-in-law there, said Anna had asked where I was and
been told I was taking children to school, at which she was
quite content--same last night apparently says the sister.
However about ½ -hour later opened eyes when I spoke--
eyes glazed and far away. Very weak it seemed. Told her
about Gabriel going to school, and the system of family-grouping
there and she smiled understandingly. Gave her
a little tea, sat her up with nurse to make it easier to swallow.
'Thank you David,' she murmured audibly. Little later
talked a bit more. I told her how deeply, deeply I love
her--at first she seemed consoled by it, but then she murmured
'<i>nicht wahr</i> [not true]'. I repeated and repeated it
till at last I think she began to believe me. 'Do you remember
when we went to France together?' I asked--and
Anna nodded, smiled. 'How terribly in love I was with
you...'


"Asked to leave while dressings changed--Anna given
morphine, I went to see social worker. Went back--Anna
asleep. Looking very bad. Ask nurse in blue about depth
of burns, etc. Only 2 deaths in 4½ years she has witnessed,
she says. 'I must just be lucky,' she says in West Country
accent. Eventually feel quite faint with distress and leave,
pass chapel, go in, ask chaplain to pray with me. Wept and
wept. Canteen closed, meet chaplain (new vicar of parish)
again afterwards and go to his house for tea--has 4 children.
Find I can hardly eat, same with drink--sheer nerves. Return.
Anna barely conscious--her mother there who had

"'<i>Fackelbearer</i> [torchbearer]' she also chants, and bits
of Lieder. Seems like the end. I talk to her of God, and all
I say she then sings. 'God will give us strength ...'


"'So many people died ...,' she chants.


"I say we all have to die, God will decide when.


"And lo, out of this seemingly dying state she emerges,
quite lucidly and loudly; eyes still glazed, but less so--
accepts great quantity of juice and even Complan and milk
when I suggest it. Amory is blessed she had kept chanting,
while I repeatedly said that she too was blessed. 'Mary
Barnes--will she forgive me?' she asks--and I read her
Mary's card. 'Mary understood--she touched me--she understood
my problems. I couldn't face it, I couldn't face
it'--but will not say what it was. Somehow--even after
phone call from her brother in which I had to explain the
situation--hope rising again: to a crescendo. Will God
allow her to live? What seemed cruel--to prolong such

<i>Wednesday, 27 June 1973</i>


"Woke at 5 am--came over to ward. Anna sleeping.
When she wakes her eyes are distant, very very weak, as
though in a far, far-off place. Mutter comes over 7-ish, but
does not return to her hotel for breakfast as Anna remains
awake. Simon, the vicar/chaplain, calls. I tell Anna--and
she asks him to stay, which he does. We all say Amen,
Mutter weeping, and I could not stop my own tears. Then
Anna spoke a prayer herself in German: <i>'Vergib' mir meine
Sünden. Herr Gott, Herr Gott, vergib' mir meine Sünden,
rache es nicht an meinen Kindern!</i> [Forgive my sins. Dear
God, dear God, forgive my sins, do not make my children
suffer for them!].' Simon must have caught the gist, for he
said another prayer: 'O Lord, forgive our sins, let thy light
and thy strength come upon us ...'


"After he had gone, Anna said with a deep sigh: '<i>Jetzt
kann ich sterben</i> [now I can die]'--and if all the agony
since last Wednesday were to come again, it would still

"Spoke to Consultant--Anna had been awake and I'd
told her who it was when he came in. Seems pleased with
general condition, despite my own feeling about weakness
in that respect: said it was important not to tire her--going
to go on giving morphine to help conserve her strength
for the real battle, the toxin battle, which begins next week,
when dead skin gradually poisons whole bloodstream. Said
that was when Anna would most need me, to see the
children as much as possible now.


"Go to see the children then, as Anna asleep. Thomas
obviously delighted to see me. Had lunch, saw Satu off on
train. Pouring with rain. Collect Gabriel from school. Face
beaming, Dominic's too, as we came up road, few minutes
late. 'We <i>looked</i> for you up there!' Dominic says, pointing
to where Alums congregating.


"At home Gabriel and Dominic play contentedly with
knights, and I read Thomas a story. Teatime with ice-cream;
bed quite early, after bath which Patrick manages
himself--read Gabriel and Dominic <i>Tintin:</i> children stay
awake for a while, but Thomas seeming quite content.


"Left 9 pm for the hospital. Anna asleep at first, but soon
wakes. I feel so desperately tired. Morphine wears off late
evening. Anna obviously anxious--talks of Noah and
Eigenheim, pursuing own ends at expense of others, or
roughly so, chanting the words--got very voluble at one
stage, talking to Noah, telling him to go away--is Noah an
evil figure in her ideas? Settles at 10.30--talk with her
mother till midnight about getting a girl to help with the

<i>Thursday, 28 June 1973</i>


"Woken in visitor's ward by telephone at 6 am--nurse
says Anna had a reasonably peaceful night, no change in her
condition, but awake if I'd like to be with her.


"Went over straight away--eyes astonishingly clear
when she opens them, but skin area of lips and all round
perimeter beginning to break up in crusts like canyons--
nose also looking more charred, on forehead can now see
tiny veins beneath surface as once on her legs--confirms
horribly Consultant's impression regarding face.


"Seems happy that I'm there, though finding it difficult
to speak, murmuring more and more. Had had morphine injection
at 5 am, but no sign of real sleep. Seems still in pain.
Calls 'Mutti!' frequently. Morphine given again, but not
very effective--fitful and anxious all morning. My father
rings, coming tomorrow. Write last piece for my arts
page in waiting-room while Anna's sheets supposed to be
changed. 'Sarah [the manager of the shop] <i>hat gewonnen</i>
[Sarah's won],' she had murmured earlier. '<i>Wann willst Du
den Contract?</i> [When will you make the contract?]' Assure

"Now, with eyes open, I see such spirit left; such great
great courage after all that has happened, and I cry with
shame and distress that the path we are striving to find is
now so irrevocably removed. Had it been barbiturates or
even slashing her wrists again, she might have quickly been
saved: whereas now the odds are so heavy against us: and
the children so young ...


"Only went to sleep around 1 pm, nurses about to do her
dressings. Finish last newspaper piece, rewrite second one,
do layout instructions, put in envelope, and post. Back at
Patrick and Megan's at ten past three, walk up to collect
Gabriel and Dominic. Feeling so tired. Warm and sunny
afternoon, children appear with their teacher at 3.30, line
up and disperse. Gabriel so young and princely--take off
their coats. Watch as Gabriel runs down the road after
Dominic: the grace and wonder of his body as he moves,
hair flying, leaping into life always. When I see Megan
wheeling Thomas and Susan together can only cry.


"Play with them at home--in garden with football, on
bikes, with Matchbox cars etc: slowly unwind, give them
the love and patience that Anna would want me to--would
give herself. Think how much Anna gives me, even in this
torment. 'My mother loves you,' she said this morning; 'but
she is awkward and can't show it easily'--how characteristic
of Anna to think of others, even of me, when she herself
is in such pain. It was when I was weeping that she said it.
And like our whole life, the courage she gives me by her
very being <i>is</i> something I can return, both to her and to
others.

[p. <i>199</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00209&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Though not drinking very much at the moment she
seems much stronger than yesterday.


"Talk to Peter on phone about help, and James Preston
in London. Put children to bed--Thomas goes to sleep all
right, but very fitful sleep, almost like Anna, waking constantly.
Worries me. Rang Mutter at hospital--she sounded
anxious--Landis there and Anna's temperature rising sharply
(8 pm)--obviously first toxin/poison testing her strength.
I said I'd come over later. Roy sounding very upset, as
though crying.


"Arrived hospital 11.30 pm--Anna rousable when I
spoke but taking only brief note. Breathing seems harder.
Bandage under chin where they are trying to soften
hardened skin. Area round lips still broken and strange: but
this clearness of her eyes and the strength of her breathing
(pulse 150) don't suggest that she is too weak to withstand
it. Somehow I feel only life is there, by no means death: as
though the courage she herself has given me, and the love
of our children had increased my own hope and spirit. Feel
only strength. Send mother home, sit with Anna till 1.30,
then fall asleep in armchair--wake at 2.30 and go over to
visitors' ward. Apparently Roy had told her not even to
think of dying--was adamant she should live! Mutter in a
bit of a state about him.


"Anna had chanted and sung, and talked a bit--rather
incoherently. I was woken at 6.30 am--nurse said she'd
called for me. Breathing definitely laboured, otherwise
temperature right down, and really quite resolute in face.
Talks about Inge, Inge, Axel-Springer, money--articulation
becoming more difficult to understand.

I keep no record for Friday: it's the day my father comes
up with my mother from London, having insisted on the
telephone that they cannot stay any longer "on the end of
a telephone" through all this without seeing me.


I'm with Anna all day. In the evening I put all the
children to bed as Patrick and Megan are going out. My
mother and father arrive: but then give presents to the
children, who are still awake and who subsequently become
too excited to go back to bed or sleep. When Patrick and
Megan return, early, the children are still awake. Then my
father begins his inevitable soliloquy about trade unions.
It's all so damned polite--and Anna isn't even mentioned.


I feel like breaking something--insist I must sleep and
usher them away. They are to take the children to the
zoo on Sunday.

<i>Saturday, 30 June 1973</i>


"Woke about 7, Gabriel and Thomas still asleep. Still
raging over last night's fiasco. In end I simply run back to
hospital--where Anna's mother with her. Says she is delirious.
Sat with Anna. Obviously very afraid, talking of
conspiracies, wants me to take her out, says I don't know

"'Can you tell me?' I ask.


"It is then that the answer, the reason, emerges for the
first time in ten days as far as I know.


"'I was Hitler.'


"'Hitler?' It seems incredible. But apart from the burning
of his corpse in petrol...?


"'But what possible connection could you see between
yourself and Hitler?'


"She closes her eyes. I wait.


"'I'd done so much bad ...'


"Can it really be so? She starts to show pain, says on the
soles of her feet. Ask if she wants to be turned--get nurse to
help me--screams as nurse put her hands under her back
and tilts her towards me to shift her. Nurse asks if she wants
anything for the pain--she says no, it's all right if she can
talk to someone.... Extraordinary, her childlike goodness
and courage.


"Incident with ambulance men--breeze in like KGB men
just as Anna talking of her fears of abduction and con-
spiracy. Call her 'my love' and 'dear'--so she calls one of

[p. <i>202</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00212&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"She says: 'You know what I'd like ... some fruit.'
Nurse offers oranges--but she asks for raspberries. I offer
strawberries. 'But what month is it?'


"'End of June--there are plenty in the shops. Would
you like me to get you some?'


"Now, after her mother's pessimistic head-shaking this
morning, the situation has yet again been reversed. Anna
wanting strawberries! And taking soup quite happily--
even blowing her nose successfully, which had been
blocked. Unbelievable.


"'Yes, you can go, if the nurse only promises not to
move me!' she says--and we all laugh.


"Takes a little to persuade her that I ought to be with
the children. Says naturally she would like to see them, if
only for a moment. Also her brother. Tell her he has rung,
is in Germany. She says she wants him to come.


"'I might not see him again,' she says.


"So awake and <i>alive</i>, she gets quite fed up with me I
think. Senses the very least 'stock' nature in my responses.
'David, I love you very much,' she will say, 'but when you
are cynical I can't bear it ...' 'Are you going now?'--as
though driving me away.


"Home at 2 pm. Go to fête at 3 with children--donkeys,
go-karts, balloons--and the Red Devils Parachute Brigade--
seven men in all, diving out with red flares; then parachutes
opening only perhaps 1,000 feet above ground.

"Return home--try to get children to help clean car,
hoping thus to exorcise awkward association?


"Go over to hospital late, after children asleep, since
Anna's mother seems anxious on phone: instead find Anna
breathing heavily but still very strongly--no cause for
alarm. Go to bed visitors' ward 11 pm, wake at 7 am."

"Woke 7 am--could not move till 7.30, as though paralysed
by continual loss of sleep, despite knowing cannot
go back to sleep again. Anna asleep--snoring loudly, face
thin--body too, as though she has lost a lot of weight.
Wakes only at 9.15--and what a smile! Like the return of
the prodigal child!


"'Good morning,' she murmurs--eyes strong and clear
again--only when she half-closes them and slips back into
slumber do they seem distant and faded. 'I feel so happy,'
she says after greeting the cleaning woman too with a
wonderful smile.


"'Was I very ill last night?' she asks. I tell her it's the
eleventh night now. 'It feels longer,' she murmurs. Wants
to dictate something, but too weak. 'Family ...' Then: '...
friends who don't mind if Gabriel is Scottish and don't
mind playing with him. Gabriel...'

"After lunch--at which Anna has soup, a peach, and asks
for ice-cream!--Roy arrives suddenly with Patty. He asks
to be left alone with Anna. 'I see you kept your side of the
bargain,' he begins--Anna a little delirious still and constant
amnesia--R.L. says: 'You burned yourself. You're
in a medical hospital. You nearly gave up on us. The staff
here seemed to feel that you didn't stand much of a chance.'


"Afterwards he asks me to see doctors about move to
London--suggests two ambulances to obviate disaster similar
to last time. Gets on my nerves, and I tell him bluntly
I'm not risking Anna's life in her present critical condition
just to make it half an hour easier for him to visit her--I
feel bad saying it, but once again I resent his assumptions.


"Berthold worried about sterilization and hygiene--
clearly resents Patty.


"Then Anna has morphine. My father and mother arrive
--children very pleased to see me (Thomas fast asleep
in the car to begin with), and we sit on the lawn outside
the wards. Ask my father if he would like to see Anna. Says
yes rather determinedly.


"'Poor, poor girl,' he murmurs when we go in--Anna
at first asleep, face somehow blacker than usual. 'On her
best days, one of the most beautiful faces I've ever seen,'
he says.


Gabriel at first anxious, unwilling to go in van. My father
offers to take him--but then he says no, wants to go with
Daddy. Driving away I say to Gabriel that Anna has been
talking about him.


"'That's what you say every day!' Gabriel complains--

"Stay the night at Patrick's--good sleep."

"Take Gabriel to school; Thomas cries when I leave (10
am) but somehow I feel he will cope, and the tears are good
tears. Anna smiles brightly when I come--her mother says
she can't make sense of what Anna says. Meanwhile Anna
seems mainly frightened--CIA she mentions once. Wants
me to take her out at all costs--again not aware why she
is there really. Begins to doze--eyes very clear though,
remarkably so. When doctors come in they both remark on
how well she looks. I say: 'She'll stop believing you if you
say it too often--everyone seems to be saying it this
morning.'


"'What lovely eyes she has,' one nurse had said to
another as they cleaned her mouth.


"I felt very drowsy. Sister does not suggest any lunch for
Anna, so I ask kitchen staff for an egg at 1 pm. She takes
it very well, though obviously very tired.


"Berthold stays, and I check local estate agents for a

"Stay up reading novel--utter rubbish. Children wake at
I am--Gabriel complaining of sore throat. Prepare Disprin,
but Gabriel asleep when I take it up to him. A bad omen?"

<i>Tuesday, 3 July 1973</i>


"Take children to school in van. Anna asking for me and
'aggressive' according to her mother. Nurse very angry,
says Anna's mother was there till 2.30 am and kept Anna
awake--shouldn't be allowed! Apparently someone has
spoken to her, though.


"Anna pleased to see me. Mutter gives me address of
Mrs Trent--Anna picks up name instantly. 'Now you go
to the Trent woman,' she says--chance of a house just
outside hospital gates. Anna's face extraordinary well, despite
the way the skin on her chin is forming an outer crust
now that no longer moves in time with the inner one. Eyes
very clear, able to focus anywhere, alert and bossy.


"I go. Success--wonderful flat on top of Georgian
house--don't like to get too excited though. Return--burns
being dressed--went to canteen for coffee and saw social
worker. When returned Anna still fantastically alert, but

"Gets fish, potato and veg! And eats lot of it--chewing
like a healthy woman! Can only shake my head. Wants
cigarette too--to which sister accords--doesn't work out,
though, as Anna unable to suck.


"Gets a bit tired of me and sends me away as the pain
intensifies and eventually I have to get nurse to give injections.
Seems such a very natural response, really.


"Take children to the sea. Tide way out--children running
over sand, picnic--but how sad to be living 'alone'
with children--how I miss Anna's presence, her <i>spirit</i>!


"Tell story of Little Bright Thing and the Crab on way
home--seems successful."


[18]


<i>Wednesday, 4 July 1973</i>


"Berthold leaves--Anna's mother had been there till
midnight and again from 5 am--pointless as far as I can
see. Nurse says Anna's mother has had a premonition. Doing
Anna no good, though. Fever again at midday.

[p. <i>208</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00218&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"In afternoon take children to the sea again, this time to
swimming pool first. Very beautiful warm evening--pale
red dusk, the almost deserted sand ... Didn't get back till
8.45. Gabriel awake with a sore throat. Patrick in kitchen
says doesn't believe in psychology because it is 'dangerous'
--instances Anna's case when I ask him to elucidate.


"Is he afraid? Identifying his own marriage ...?


[19]


<i>Thursday, 5 July 1973</i>


"Take children to school--growing dissension between
Gabriel and Dominic. At the hospital Anna's temperature
is shooting up again--from 37° to 39.6° in a couple of hours.
Nurse says there is nothing one can do--with such large
burns the skin cannot control in normal way. Sleeps. Go and
buy present for Patrick and Megan. Return to their house.
Peter and new children's help already there. Gloria, she is
called, blond-haired, rotund, wide fat face with an apple
on bosom of her T-shirt. Makes little effort unless asked.
Fear the worst.


"Leave after collecting Gabriel from school--the house
is a godsend."


But Gloria turns out to be wonderful with the children.
She thinks constantly of their needs, and is aware of their
individual natures. With her, in the big Georgian mansion,

[p. <i>209</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00219&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It cannot all be coincidence, it must be part of a pattern.
On Friday Anna undergoes her first major operation, at
least a week before expected. She comes out of the an-
aesthesia in the early afternoon as though she has just returned
from a bracing, invigorating holiday. I am told she
will be drowsy, possibly in pain: instead she is as bright as
a button.


Scaffolding bars now make a sort of four-poster canopy-frame
over the bed; and an assortment of pulleys and wide,
solid circular weights support her tightly bandaged legs in
the air like a piece of Heath Robinsonia. They have
"cleaned" the entire surface of her legs and thighs to form
a base for skin-grafting. Everyone is astonished by her
recovery.


Dear James,


Thank you and Miranda for writing to me. If it's
hard for me even to telephone please don't imagine
that I've sunk into total withdrawal--it's simply that
the nature of Anna's injuries, the fact that I must
live with the possibility, even probability, of her
death for the next three months or more makes it
impossible for me to lift either pen or receiver. In

[p. <i>210</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00220&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sometimes I wonder whether I can take so much
grief and empathy: how I can possibly keep myself
whole and alive for the children, for instance, when
so much is at stake; yet curiously, it is from Anna
herself I draw my real courage. Her spirit, her
unique spirit has flowered these past few weeks in
a way which seems to grip the entire hospital--
from cleaners to nursing staff, from doctors to fellow
patients. The miracle of her recovery to date is on
everyone's lips--and Anna's sheer bravery in the
face of seemingly fatal burns. Yesterday she asked
if I could obtain some marijuana for her; and when
I asked why, she said because today she would be
dead! She talks in three languages, tried to marry
off one of the nurses to Peter, and when told one
evening the young male nurse would be looking
after her during the night, exclaimed: "Oh good!
I rather like him!"


Nothing I can write on this card can convey the
miraculous nature of these days: except perhaps if
I say that <i>whatever</i> happens--whether Anna is
spared or must die--the courage she shows now is
something no one here will ever, ever forget.


Love,<br />
David

<i>Saturday, 7 July 1973</i>


"Woke at 5 am, then 7 am--fitful sleep, nervous dreams--
children waking and whimpering between 11 pm and 1 am.
Cannot help wondering if it's telepathic. Try not to.


"Children woke--played in their room for an hour till
8 am; I lay in a sort of stupor till 9 while Gloria looked after
them. Read <i>The Waste Land</i> which happened to be beside
my bed--somehow (after what I have been through?) its
originality has become commonplace and its rhymes too
light.


"For almost the first time I began to wonder whether
I can cope.


"Went over to hospital at 9.30--Anna wide awake, being
fed milk. Nurse gives me the bottle. Cold. Anna asks for
warm milk--smiles when I say Miss Bossy Boots. 'Bright
as a button she's been this morning,' says nurse. Seems to
have had good rest last night. We talk a little. Then Anna
announces she would like '<i>richtige Analyse</i> [proper analysis]'
--as opposed to 'irrational' forms she is currently receiving
--Landis and the rest.


"Then doctor comes to take blood. After he has gone, I
ask her what she means. Says that current analysis not bad,
but can only go 'so far'. I ask if she feels it put too much
pressure on her--says yes. But the alternative? She could
have stayed at the mental hospital and had ECT.


"'You wouldn't have wanted that, would you?' I ask.


"'No. But then I wouldn't have wanted this,' she remarks.


"I feel stunned--and relieved--when she says she can't

[p. <i>212</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00222&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"'And do you want your mother to come?'


"'No. But you can give her a letter ... Tell her I'm
getting better.'


"For the first time I feel she really knows what is up.
She had said, 'But it is you who are burned,' and such like,
too, I <i>know</i>--but that last remark puts it beyond doubt.
'I wouldn't have wanted this.'


"'Is my face so terrible?'


"How do I answer that? I say, to someone who doesn't
know you it might appear a little frightening--and she
answers my face too could be that!!


"'I don't want to become a drug addict,' she says (concerning
morphine).


"Seems very surprised when they tell her has pins through
her legs.


"Physically she appears to be in an extraordinary condition
considering that the operation was only yesterday.
Blood pressure steady, TPR and respiration fine, drinking
gallons, ice-cream for breakfast...


"I came away in a daze--knowing I was already deeply
depressed this morning. It is the recurring sense of guilt, of
having exposed Anna unnecessarily to an injury which cannot
be undone, which if it does not take her life will cripple
her for the rest of it..."


"Children playing with Mutter in 'secret' garden. Lunch.
In the afternoon the Horse Show--surprising how Thomas
runs off on his own there, seemingly unperturbed and not
in the least frightened of losing me: whereas at home he
still cries if I even go upstairs without him. Buy flowers

[p. <i>213</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00223&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Takes hours to settle her--wants me to sleep in her bed
to keep her warm! New drip still only barely running,
complaining of much pain--finally leave at midnight.


"When I offer to read letter from Patty which I find in
bedside cabinet, Anna waves it away.


"'Another time. Patty is so intense ...'"


[21]


<i>Sunday, 8 July 1973</i>


"Woke latish--children came in. Got up after 9 am. Went
over to Anna at eleven--had just woken after sleeping

[p. <i>214</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00224&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"'<i>Wenn meine Mutter nicht da ist, geht's mir blendend</i>
[when my mother's not there I feel perfect],' she whispers
to me. Still very frightened--wants me to stay overnight.
Says night nurse never there to keep her company. Then
asks for grapefruit!


"Under impression she has killed Gabriel. Anxious to
leave the place.


"Located tin of grapefruit in kitchens. Fetch and feed her
with some--then leave while dressings being changed.
Children playing on common with Mutter--post letters
and buy a few things.


"Vicar with children. Says he saw Anna yesterday afternoon
and had a ten-minute talk with her--surprised at her
lucidity. She had said something very significant before he
left which I might understand. She had asked where I was--
and being told I was now the vicar's neighbour and thus
living very close at hand in a flat which his wife had helped
to get, Anna had gone quiet and then suddenly said: 'If you
try to help, you will get hurt.'"


"Go over to ward after lunch. Gunhilda comes at about
3. Goes in and Anna immediately recognizes her; talks about
Laing--says shouldn't have gone on the trip, that she was
too young, her children were too small ...


"Surprised Gunhilda by insisting that she should also
have a cup of Ribena and some of the apple I was giving
her. Then seemed to fall asleep, and we went out, talking
in waiting-room.


"SEN passes saying Anna asking to see me--no, demanding!

[p. <i>215</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00225&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Return to ward. Anna asleep for further hour. Then
mistakes me for someone else--smiles with delight when she
realizes. Says she thought I was going away from her,
leaving her with short hair ... Feels that doctor has made
incision with a knife. Talks a bit about the mental hospital
and the country--'wonderful few days'. Then she had left
farmhouse because she 'didn't want to share it with
others'--and when I ask what and whom she means, she
says the quality of it with Mary Barnes et al.


"I feel so tired. Stay with Anna till 11 pm when she begins
to sleep again. Can hardly keep my eyes open to write
this..."


[22]


Perhaps most difficult of all--more difficult even than the
sight, the reality of her condition, three-quarters of her
body ravaged by burns--are Anna's moments of insight
into what happened, her revelations. I feel crucified by
them.

[p. <i>216</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00226&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Monday, 9 July 1973</i>


"Woken at 6 am by Gabriel--says his throat is sore--
falls asleep in my bed; then Thomas comes over and has no
intention of sleeping. Had breakfast and then came over
about 9 am. Anna awake--cleaner (the one with the
German husband) telling her I was coming. Looks fairly
well--lips parched and cracked--thirsty. Said she had not
slept--not in the least hysterical. Show her pictures of
children--does not immediately recognize Gabriel. Again
spoke of time when the healing will be over. Wants 'good'
analyst--this said <i>à propos</i> her fears of a Chinese invasion.
Says that was her belief in the country--that she had burned
herself as she didn't have the courage to kill the children.
But even if the Chinese were to come why kill the children?
I ask.


"'To save them from the six hours of torture,' she says.


"I ask if fear of Chinese could have anything to do with
childhood fear of Russians? Says yes.


"'What would be the matter with continuing analysis
with Roy?' I ask.


"'When he comes back?'


"She is surprised when I tell her Landis hasn't gone away.


"'I'm very angry with him,' she explains.


"'Why?'


"'Because he ought to have known.'


"'Known?'


"'He should have seen that some people have tendencies ...'


"'But would you have wanted ECT at the mental
hospital?'


"'Well, if I'd had it at the beginning. I don't think it did
any good to go through all that--'

[p. <i>217</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00227&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"My heart sinks as my worst fears are confirmed. Intuition
had told me right at the beginning Anna could ill
cope with it all, however theoretically attractive Laing's
ideas...


"'Was Berthold affected by the burns?' she asks--as
though he might have been burned as well.


"'Where was I the first two days? What did they give
me?'


"Then the Registrar comes in. Asks Anna how she is.


"'Not so bad,' Anna answers.


"'Not so grand,' he repeats mistakenly. Significant misinterpretation,
as it appears. Asks to speak to me. Asks
whether I am willing to give skin if no other available.
Rings mortician--none. Smiles at mortician's reply that
there are 'two good ones in fridge', but no permission to
use them. (Only if a post-mortem is required is one allowed
to touch a body.)


"Then, finally, agrees to fill me in a little on Anna's
chances.


"'I can see you've been stimulated by your wife's progress,'
he begins, 'and you probably think that I was wrong
to paint such a black picture in the beginning. Certainly her
response up to now is remarkable. But,' and he turns back
to me, 'I still hold to what I said. She's not out of the woods
at all. She's still a very sick woman. She's still getting fevers.
There's the catheter, and she could get septicaemia.


"'I'm not saying she couldn't survive--some people have.
But I've seen cases like this so often. They survive the first
operation, the second--and then complications set in. I've
seen it before. And if she were to survive--I mean she'll
never be able to look after the children again ...'


"I explain how in fact she had not been able to do that
fully even before the present circumstances--that I am not

[p. <i>218</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00228&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"But, inside, his first pronouncement has left me floored
again--the sheer hopelessness of all this struggle, the hopelessness
of hope. I refuse to believe Anna will die because
she is so full of spirit at the moment; but logically I know
that could change very suddenly.


"'You must be prepared for the worst, no good buoying
up your hopes,' he says. No; but this is present reality, with
Anna alive, lucid, awake--that is the world I am living in
at present, and the other one--the cost of the flat, the girl,
and so on--is so utterly irrelevant at this moment.


"See Anna.


"'Well,' she asks, 'what did you talk about?'


"I say: 'Being.'


"'Always so vague!' Anna clips--though she cannot
know what it costs me to face her after this kind of
prognosis.


"Go home when they start to change dressings. Morphine
and sleep pm."


It is agreed that the operation will take place the next
day. They will take the top layer of skin from my thighs--

9·7·73


Dear Roy,


Gunhilda came down yesterday and will have
filled you in by now. Like everyone who comes
into contact with Anna at the moment Gunhilda
seemed overwhelmed by Anna's radiance, seemingly
unperturbed either by her injuries or the major
operation she went through on Friday. It is truly
something of a miracle; and yet one cannot pretend
that fate is now on her side. The Senior Registrar
continues to paint a black picture--not, I think,
because they have in any way given up, but because
experience teaches them to be sceptical until a patient
actually stands up and walks out of the hospital.
Nor do I quarrel with this attitude--his job is to do
everything medically possible to save Anna's life;
it is mine to hope that she will live.


Much more distressing than the doctor's refusal to
show optimism, however, is Anna's own attitude
towards what has happened. Pointless to conceal that
she feels angry towards you, feels you failed to
recognize the danger of her suicidal tendencies, that
the weeks of psychosis were unnecessary and could
have been halted at the beginning ... I retell this not
to hurt you, Roy, but because it hurts <i>me</i> so much.
Your commitment to recovery from "schizophrenia"

[p. <i>220</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00230&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Gunhilda asked about visiting etc, and I found it
hard to give a straightforward answer. Anna's will to
live is simply not in question at the moment, she is
very strong. The nursing staff resent too many visitors
because they feel it is exhausting Anna when
she needs all the rest and calm she can get under such
painful circumstances. On the other hand it is important,
in terms of her continual fears and phantasies
of plots, conspiracies, bugging, scandal, invasion,
murder, etc, that recognizable faces from outside
should appear--they are by far the best way of
dispelling such states of anxiety.


I shall stop here, though there is so much more
to say. I love Anna and only seem able to cope at
that level: any wider issues--guilt, responsibility,
death--leave me shattered.


Love, David

<i>Tuesday, 10 July 1973</i>


"Wake at 5 am; get up at 6.30; over at ward at 6.50--
nobody about, so peaceful. Wondering whether I should
have made a last will! Get undressed, put on white bed-gown,
take off rings etc, take pre-med pills. Three men
talking in and beside next bed, cannot get to sleep at all--
ask sister for my Conrad; read a few pages about how he
wrote <i>Nostromo</i> (he thought he had written himself out
already), started the story--and the next I knew poles were
being slid on both sides of me, I was lifted onto a trolley-bed
and wheeled outside--sister and the theatre boy pushing
me up ramp. Along corridor--doors on each side,
fluorescent lights. Then a woman in green tie-down theatre
cap asking me my name--Is your name David Branwen
Reed? Yes. Made me flex and ease my fingers and wrist,
rubbed back of my hand. I could see the anaesthetist I had
met the night before, and in went the needle--pushing into
the back of my hand. Do you feel yourself falling asleep?
the woman asked--and I turned my head over to the other
side, to Sister, to tell her something--that I loved Anna?


"Woke later--thighs stinging--seemed to be about 11.30
am--2½ hours after going in. Nurse came in with syringe,
I wanted to get out of bed, the pain in the thighs was so
cruel I felt only by distracting myself, by putting weight on
my feet, could I bear it. Then for a moment it seemed to get
better and I sent her away--too soon, too optimistic, alas,
for not long later I was calling for her, she told me to roll
over...

"Woke in the afternoon--talked to Nurse Sue, mostly
about Anna; Mutter and Simon both came and listened.
Slept at 7 pm; woke at i am though, with pain in chest and
back and was given something which put me back to sleep."


[24]


<i>Wednesday, 11 July 1973</i>


"Woke early. Was got up and out of bed after breakfast
and allowed to see Anna. She had sent the blue flowers
from Caroline to my ward the previous afternoon! The
Registrar and the surgeon who'd taken my skin--both
passed by--seemed stunned to see me there--Registrar says:
'I told you it would take two or three days--you've gone
one better than anyone else!' The surgeon warns that too
much movement doesn't help even healing. Anna relatively
quiet, dozes mostly, so I go and see children in morning."


Where they have applied my skin on Anna's legs her
limbs seem so thin, like sticks.

"I took Gabriel in to see Anna at 2.15 and only for a
very brief moment. Anna pretty quiet after rebandaging
and asking us to leave telephone number. Her chin had been
covered with a sheet, her chest and legs also--nevertheless
the scab wounds on her face worry Gabriel. He shies back
and I try to explain where it is getting better already.


"Then we go for a walk on the grass and talk about it."

<i>Friday, 13 July 1973</i>


"9.45 in the evening Gabriel goes to bed. For several
moments I wondered how I could possibly read Alice to
him, I was so filled with the image of Anna: so terribly
thin--'getting thinner before your eyes' as the Registrar
put it this evening in pointing out the importance of solids.
Her legs--like spindles, and held by actual metal spindles;
the gauze hanging on them, draped over them, as though
drying in the midday sun ... This is what greeted me this
morning when I arrived--at first not able to see her because
of the dressings being changed. Very quiet, staring,

[p. <i>224</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00234&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"At first he spoke to her very movingly.


"'I never trusted you,' said Anna.


"'You should have,' replied my father. 'Everyone who
knows me trusts me.' But then began to talk of how nice it
would be to see her again at the country house and in Italy.
I was crying, it seemed so much like a last parting; and
after he had gone Anna told me she was sorry he had come.


"'Why?'


"'Because he sounded so hopeless.'


"Talked a little afterwards with my father. Anna got
very fearful meanwhile. Had been asking nurse repeatedly
for me. Did not want me to go at lunch, so I stayed all day
till 7.45, by which time she was quite sleepy and ready for
me to go. Double drip up. The Registrar calls in at 6.15,
amused by the way Anna makes him promise to give anaesthetic
when changing dressings, but does not look too
pleased with legs. 'Still a lot of dead skin to come off,' he
says. 'It's going to take a long time.' Mutter leaves about
5pm.


"As for myself, still in great pain when I walk--and
bandages beginning to pong like something tropical!
Yesterday even worse ..."

[27]


The pain in my thighs goes on, I have difficulty in sleeping,
and it saps the very strength, both moral and physical, I
need for Anna. I am reaching the edge.


[28]


<i>Sunday, 15 July 1973</i>


"Woke latish--telephone call from ward sister saying
that Anna is asking for me--but excruciating pain in getting
up, so I only got there at ten. They had changed her
dressings and she seemed quite peaceful by then - temperature
normal, a little more white skin exposed under the lips,
but a nasty new gash over left eye as though knocked with
something. Managed to give her a lot of milk, soup, and the
peaches. In the afternoon the male nurse came to do her
observations. I asked how he had come into nursing. Said
he had been in merchant navy, then fallen ill, tried this and
liked it--too long a chore to do the whole medical training
involved in becoming a doctor.


"Anna seemed to be dozing while he spoke and cleaned
her mouth (she didn't want him to do dressings and there
was some misunderstanding). But later, after tea, she asked
for the 'seaman'--said she would only eat supper if he did
too! I wanted to cry I felt so moved."

[p. <i>226</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00236&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Monday, 16 July 1973</i>


"Woke early, heard Thomas crying, and as Gloria had
been awake coughing for much of the night I thought I
would try to help by being first up--however painful. Put
Thomas on potty. He ran downstairs then in his pyjama
top and asked Mrs Trent lots of questions, beginning
'What's this for?'--all of which she answers so genuinely
and straightforwardly. Gabriel asleep meanwhile.


"Breakfasted but could not manage bike, so had to wait
till 9 am and the children in fit condition to come--i.e.
wearing shoes.


"When eventually I got there I felt pale and exhausted.
Anna seemed dozy, but pleased at least to see me. Nothing
more exchanged till Laurie Herbert arrived at almost 12.15.
Nurse said she'd give Anna her soup--though Anna insisting
that the nurse should first have her own lunch!


"Talked about whole story to Laurie--a salutary telling,
for he seemed to listen intently and pick up many associations
--the very Christian symbolism--the continual attempt
to squeeze through narrow windows, etc, the search for
light, for rebirth. Says Anna needs to know of her own
courage--be helped to emerge from all this positively.


"Then I took him into Anna's room, but Anna asleep.
I think he was very cut. 'Worse than one could possibly
imagine,' he murmured. He left to eat with Gloria and
children, while I stayed with Anna. Towards 3 pm she
seemed to wake a little more, becoming quite bright--and
then Gunhilda came in. That really seemed to make the light
shine--Gunhilda told story of <i>Zaunköpfchen</i>, and sang a
song. Wondering how to feed up Anna a little more.


"Then Anna surprised me--and Gunhilda--by asking
about the Community. Gunhilda tells how Laing and Landis

[p. <i>227</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00237&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"'I'm sorry I smashed the Community,' says Anna--'No,
you did the right thing,' replies Gunhilda. 'You shook it up
at a time when it most needed it.'


"But at what cost!


"Nurse gives Anna a beaker of milk, but suddenly will
not drink unless <i>I</i> have some too! Says she is having it all
'easy and comfortable' in her bed while David suffers! Male
nurse, about to go, offers to get sauerkraut and wurst. 'We
think the world of you,' he says to Anna, giving her lager
and lime she'd just asked for. 'Now, no singing mind!'


"Sit on. Laurie comes and I go out--Anna seems anxious
that <i>I</i> get a rest, not exhausted by her when I say I am
afraid too many visitors would tire her.


"Laurie has brought beautiful flowers--so I send him in
with them to give to Anna personally. Apparently she asks
him to take good care of me!


"Go to local pub. Talk of other things as well--Laing,
effect on children, faith ...


"Return at about 8. Getting dark and Anna quiet. Her
teeth white, but when her eyelids close it is only black you
see from the left. How can this frail body survive, I wonder
--and yet somehow it <i>will</i>! Leave, tired, at 10 pm.


"Remembering yesterday--Laurie's mention of resurrection
and the vivid picture I have in my mind of Anna's
legs up: crucifixion. Also on responsibility: that the whole
problem had been one of responsibility--and yet one cannot
act God, cannot take responsibility for <i>everything</i>.


"Felt a bit better--told at 9.15 that Anna would be
having anaesthetic and new dressings at 11, and meanwhile
having linen changed and face done till 10.15. Anna quiet

[p. <i>228</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00238&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Collected by Gloria and children at 11 am and played
with them till lunch--both so contented really.


"After lunch, while children 'rested', wrote to Landis--
probably unfairly, but venting my spleen at Community
and helpers and their artificiality--how they used Anna
as convenient martyr symbol from the beginning! Poor
Landis!


"At hospital shocked to see nose-tube for feeding Anna--
so sickened when nurse began to suck out through it that
I had to leave. Sister explained necessity--Anna not taking
sufficient solids. Then sat with Anna till 6.45. Much of the
time apparently asleep (as when physiotherapist came), but
actually taking much in. Spoke of Roy, and Roy's child.
Calls him 'David Roy'. 'By artificial insemination.' When
picked up by boys at the fair? Yes. Took 2½ beakers of
milk, but major fiasco over orange (my fault for not thinking)
and nurse had to use aspirator--most uncomfortable--
Anna furious with her, saying only 'her' David to come
near!


"<i>Walked</i> home (without crutches!) and went, after
saying goodnight to Gabriel, to the central library.


"Saw Anna, but she seemed fearful--talked of poisoning,
and people taking me 'upstairs'--left 10.30. Went to bed."


<i>Wednesday, 18 July 1973</i>


"Woke about 3.30 am and could not sleep for an hour.
When I did I started a series of dreams about Anna--about

[p. <i>229</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00239&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"There was one terrible sequence--like a film and in
colour--in which I found myself among American troops
advancing through a town or village somewhere (it started
by seeing a picture of the vehicles and making a film of
them--Hondas and limousines just painted another colour).
Then the hair-raising ride; and as we drove, troops throwing
bombs in doorways--would make puff of smoke, then
mothers would come out pulling babies behind them from
the débris--mothers naked, flesh pink, and on their backs
and backsides a sort of grey-blue fungus burning their
skin--some of the babies already deformed by it--fingers
and limbs. How first Anna tried her suicide I cannot now
remember--only that as she thought a second time about it
and started back across the street, she was immediately run
down by a double-decker bus. Report to the police station
at the top of a department store; the distress I remember
clearly, and talking to a multi-denominational clergyman
called then to 'assist'--at first I shooed him away, but then
called him back, told him I was seeking a different religion
from the Anglican, one of the Spirit of God. Then a sort
of funeral meeting of relations (all dressed in black)--
mostly my family, against my will, insisting it was 'necessary'
that we all be together and it be done right; (I
remember sobbing between my mother's legs) and then
Anna appears, on chair, with a bandage on her forehead--
talking--and I am so credulous and wanting it to be true
that I get up to check verity of her death (certificate etc)--
but people around me make motions and signs signifying
that Anna has come to visit only from her other world, and
I should accept even this as a mercy."

[p. <i>230</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00240&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Woke finally later than usual, breakfasted and was taken
to hospital by Gloria and Thomas--children seemingly very
contented. Mrs Trent departing for a few days, Gabriel
making a Fischer-set aeroplane and Thomas trying his hand.


"Anna had just been changed when I got there. After
while I noticed that the drips had finished. I told the male
nurse and he turned them off. For an hour the drip was left
motionless--and then wouldn't start! The other Senior
Registrar called in. Looked for another vein, but none immediately
available. It was decided to give all fluids via
nose-pipe. Then nurse asked him to speak to me--went up
to the sitting-room. Sat down. Said sister had told him I
wanted a word with him.


"Had a long talk. Told him I knew it was serious and
wanted to be kept objectively abreast of things in principle,
but in fact got very upset if told that Anna was going to
die. Wanted actually only to hear good news. So he explained
problems--sudden burning up of muscle, etc, and
danger of secondary pack-up of organs, such as digestion.
Meanwhile large areas of burned skin uncovered, and even
on legs no more skin-laying possible as areas still too messy
to take it. Slower than expected--and so little time to play
with as body wastes away. Once the body is sealed one can
begin to equalize the race between intake and out. 'Chances
of survival, I would think, are unlikely,' he says. 'But she has
defied the law of averages in coming this far--perhaps she
might make it.' Would be hospitalized there at least 3-6
months before move to London possible. Rehabilitation--
possible amputation of fingers necessary, so badly burned.
If she could manage next week, though, she would be over
the hump.


"Saw Anna--meanwhile one drip started at least. Told

[p. <i>231</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00241&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Rode back to ward on bike. Both drips working now,
but Anna in great discomfort with tube--says wants it
out--will take drip-feed but not this--and when I try to
explain reason so vital, says, 'Oh you always want to be
right'--just as my father used to when I was a child.
Eventually she told me to go away--so I did till after four.
Had my own packing bandages removed. When I went
back Anna was looking very pale and trembling - comforted
to see me I think. Said she didn't want to be a
call-girl.


"Little chance of that now!


"Didn't want me to go home for supper and put children
to bed. 'They can manage all right there for one night,
stay with me ...' So I did--and half an hour later Anna
quite happily let me go.


"Returned at 9 pm--uncomfortable, mucus in throat,
etc--aspirated--quite horrid to look at. Remains uncomfortable
all time I'm there--almost unable to talk--seems
to trust night staff though, and asked me to go and be with
children at 11 pm. My own legs still stiff and enervated,
tender, where bandages removed. Hope all will be OK.
Nurse said I'd never lose traces all my life--quite a shock in
itself, though she tried to cover up a little. 'I mean you'll
always know, though others probably won't be able to
see...'


"Dream about buying house from family, moving away
and converting it--investigated by government/council
agent.


"Alarming symbolism! Particularly as my feelings beginning
to go beyond simple 'save Anna' stage ..."

[p. <i>232</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00242&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

[29]


<i>Thursday, 19 July 1973</i>


"Went in on bike to Anna. Told she was about to have
anaesthetic--seemed very parched in throat and still very
difficult to talk. A lot of black stuff still in her mouth. The
Registrar came round with another consultant (a man of
shortish build with bushy beard and rather suffering, intelligent
face) who came right up to the head of the bed and
asked if she were cold at all. Eventually Anna threw me out
for not being able to understand her mumblings.


"Went home for lunch at 12.30--the anaesthetic delayed
owing to non-appearance of anaesthetist, and her hands
about to be done. Was told I would be phoned in the afternoon
about what would happen--had lunch with children
and played with them a bit--talked to Gloria about length
of stay, etc; hospital phoned after 3 pm to say no anaesthetic
to be given. Arrived to find Anna rather pale and uncomfortable
--nurses cleaning her mouth--gave her some water
and slowly cleared the mouth and throat till she could speak.


"Sister spoke to me--said yes, was really a case of nursing
now. Then male nurse left and the female nurse found it
more difficult to clear Anna's throat. Eventually, though,
she seemed to go into a fitful sleep (with her left hand,
plastic-bagged, shaking like a leaf beside her head). She
awoke seemingly much refreshed. Did not want me to go
home, so had my supper there--but she didn't like my talking
to the nurse and told me off in no uncertain manner!
Undoubtedly it is her wit and tenacity have brought her
through.

[p. <i>233</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00243&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Alarmed to read in textbook that burns of more than a
certain percentage have no chance of survival--and surgeons
not recommended to prolong life at start of hospital
treatment.


"Will she live? Can she live? Still so impossible to tell--
statistically impossible: yet so far she survives.


"Eventually got angry with me again for talking to nurse
(seemed to distrust her) and told me not to come for a day.


"Yet we are all dying--and time is an illusion."


"'<i>Du kannst nach Hause gehen--die Früchte deiner
Arbeit ausüben</i> [you can go home now--reap the rewards
of your work].'


"Dream: chasing someone with the police and Peter--at
top of a sort of Empire State Building, of steps; coming
down get frightened, have to go backwards--something to
do with death."


The passage in the book, <i>Burns and their Treatment</i> by
Muir and Barclay, reads:
<blockquote>
<p>
HOPELESS CASES
</p>
<p>
The facilities available for the treatment of burns shock make
it possible for almost all patients, no matter how severe their
injuries are, to survive through the shock period. In the present
state of our knowledge, however, patients with burns above a
critical size invariably succumb after having lived in great pain
and misery for a few days or weeks.
</p>
<p>
The relationship between increasing age and the decreasing
size of burn which will be fatal has already been discussed in
Chapter 1, and a simplified form of "probability chart" is
reproduced in Fig. 20.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>[p. <i>234</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00244&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
The surgeon will sometimes be faced with the situation where
the age of the patient and the size of his burn put him in the
category where recovery is unknown. The question must then
be asked whether it is not more humane to give only symptomatic
treatment and to make the patient as comfortable as
possible, while awaiting the inevitable end, than to persevere
with resuscitation regardless of the outcome. We believe that
this is a proper question for the surgeon to ask himself and
that when the indications are clear it is his duty to withhold
active resuscitation, but to give as much symptomatic relief
as possible.

According to the Muir Barclay chart in their book, Anna
might have a good chance of recovery if her burns do not
exceed 37% of her total body. Between 37% and 50%
she would have a "small chance of recovery". Above 50%
she is doomed to die.


Anna's burns exceed 75%.

<i>Friday, 20 July 1973</i>


"Soaked off gauze in bath--slow, but not as painful as I
supposed, since it was I who was inflicting the pain. Arrived
at 11 am--Anna still very weak, only able to say a
few words--very pale--respirations high. Went to sleep
and I left at 12.30. The Registrar says no change really. Not
keeping down stomach foods, though. Returned after lunch

[p. <i>235</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00245&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"They leave at 8 pm, and Laurie and I are alone for
supper once Gabriel settles. We talk about writing poetry,
and Anna; the need to have fun--not to apportion blame,
but to find one's smaller place in the universe--not take
upon oneself God's role, which is what I was doing really--
so exhausted by everything."


[31]


<i>Saturday, 21 July 1973</i>


"Went in morning: Anna still very weak and finding it
almost impossible to talk. But still cheerful--smile for Mrs

[p. <i>236</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00246&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"'Was it too awful?' I asked; and her whole face said yes.
On the other hand she seemed definitely to want Patty to
come--or showed pleasure at the thought.


"Then in the afternoon Landis rang and said he would
come instead. He arrived at 7.45 and I went home and wrote
newspaper piece. Anna very weak, though showing good
response to Roy.


"He came over then at 11 pm and we talked until 4 am--
of guilt, of helpers, of irresponsibility, alternatives, other
cases ... Felt clearly my own uprightness and distrust of
others--not good."


[32]


<i>Sunday, 22 July 1973</i>


"Went to the hospital to collect Roy at 8 am--discussed
nose-tube; took him to the station. At hospital Anna not

"I went into town for the evening. The cinemas were
booked out, so I wandered a little in the streets of the old
quarter; then drove into the country, without stopping,
without knowing where I was going. It was dusk when I
reached the great, ruined abbey."

[p. <i>238</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00248&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

[33]


<i>Monday, 23 July 1973</i>


Woke finally before 8 am after uncomfortable night in
the van--cold and continually slipping off mattress.


Picked way over and beneath the ruined abbey then,
thinking of its size, its self-sufficiency: an example of a real
community, devoted to spiritual and religious aims and not
relying--as so many others--on generosity of others. Related
to Laurie's book and its anti-money theme very extraordinarily.
Thought how temporal greed (under Henry
VIII) had crushed it: and that one must come to see
"money" as a sort of interval in man's history.


Drove back mid-morning.


"At hospital (11.30 am) Anna 'out' and oxygen cylinders
by the bed. Nurse says that she had had anaesthetic and that
the dressings on her legs had been changed, and more of my
skin put on. Suggested I come after lunch. At home there
was a note from Gunhiida saying had returned to London
as no Bed and Breakfast available. Gave Gabriel and Thomas
their presents from my trip--Thomas almost asleep on
Gloria's lap, Gabriel playing with neighbour's boy.


Worked on layout for newspaper page. After lunch rewrote
a little, posted to typist. Rang paper, then cycled to
hospital. There Anna very much awake: breathing strongly
but very fast--mouth extraordinarily clean and fresh.
Seemed to recognize me, though eyes having difficulty in
staying down--often sliding upwards. Tried to tell me
something, her whole head shaking: looked intently at

[p. <i>239</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00249&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Gave her water. But male nurse says only sips advisable
as she has difficulty with mucus etc, in throat. Calmed her a
little, shaded her eyes and tried to encourage her to sleep,
saying there would be time to talk, but now she must keep
all her strength ...


"The flowers, bought only on Saturday evening, had already
begun to wilt--all of them I noticed suddenly--as
though someone had sprayed them with something. I could
not but be aware of an omen, with Anna so very weak.
Anaesthetic apparently not given owing to her condition,
only form of ether and then relaxing injection lasting an
hour. Sister says her condition 'worst so far'. Keeps saying
that. Says I should stay in the ward if I wish, the waiting-room
couch will be made up. Agreed to see how things go.


"At one point I had felt an urge to go into town to see
the film I'd missed previous night, but (7.30 pm) Anna
still waking from snatches of snoring-like sleep every few
minutes. Seems to have pain or something under left
shoulder, tipping hand towards me. Eyes sliding more and
more upwards--gradually impossible to bring them down.
Sitting there without a book suddenly I became aware of
what I was really missing ...


"Read Book of Job, first chapter, as Anna seemed to say
yes when I asked her--Roy had recommended it when I
deposited him at the station, reminded of Job's temptations

[p. <i>240</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00250&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"About 9 pm I asked sister to call the vicar. He came
immediately, and we said prayers. Tried to get Anna to
open her eyes and look at me when I told her the intention.
Then Simon asked: 'Would you like me to pray?' She
seemed briefly to nod her head in acknowledgment or to
say yes. We knelt.


"Afterwards Simon stayed for over an hour while we
talked of God, of the need not to usurp His place. Also of
the abbey, of money, of the need for the Church to become
more political. Anna began to stir her head agitatedly (not
at what we were saying, though, I think), and when I
caressed her hair with my fingers she seemed--as she had
done in the evening--to push her head upwards, against
the palm of my hand ...


"Simon left about 11 pm. I talked to the staff nurse about
acupuncture--I can't remember how it came up. She had
just aspirated 30mls from the stomach tube and put in a
small feed, had left me reading, and then there we were
standing on each side of the bed ... We talked about the
spirit as an element of healing. I was almost angry, didn't
want to argue over Anna's sick body. Then I asked about
whether I should go home or not--and we stood away
from the bed. She said it was up to me, and I asked what
was likely to happen in the next few days.


"'She will probably just...,' and she motioned with her
hand, signifying sinking.


"I asked what that meant: wouldn't something fail? She
shook her head. 'Not necessarily.' She seemed to want to
explain as best she could, but to be unable, or wary in
choosing words lest she upset me. I urged her to be

[p. <i>241</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00251&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"We discussed whether it was better for me to go home
or to stay in the ward waiting-room. On balance, she
thought the waiting-room. She went to get pillows, but
blanket and pillow already there. She said she would call
me if Anna's condition changed at all.


"It was about midnight now. I wondered momentarily
if--as at the farm--I would be guilty of deserting Anna if
I went to sleep; but it seemed too important for me to get
some sleep if I was to cope with whatever might happen
later.


"Got onto my knees and began to pray--as once when
a child. Only the prayer was difficult.


"'Oh God ... Oh God ... I don't know what to ask of
you ... I don't know what is best for Anna ... But I beg
you to give me courage to cope with what you decide,
whether it be Anna's death or her rebirth in recovery.


"'And forgive, dear God, my awful failings--my weakness,
my superficiality--all those failings where in contrast
Anna possesses such strength ... Amen.'


"I lay down, but could not sleep for a long while. At
one point the settee began to tremble, and I wondered
whether that were not a transference, but no one came.
Eventually I slipped away into sleep.


"When I awoke it was dark: and above me, as I was
turning, was a dark figure. I was frightened and shrank
back.


"It was the little night sister.

"She apologized, and then said: 'I'm afraid I've got some
bad news. Your wife passed away a few minutes ago.'


"I held her hand as she stood there, buried my head
against her. Then she sat down, insisting I wait until the
doctor came before going in. She explained that it had
happened 'quite, quite peacefully'. The nurse, who had
stayed with her, had left to replace the saline bottle, and
when she came back Anna seemed to have gone.


"It seemed impossible to digest--mind-leaping, incredulous,
because unimaginable. We talked; then I asked if the
vicar could be called.


"It was 2 am, and 2.30 by the time Simon was there. I
told him what had happened. Later the doctor called. Presumably
death was confirmed, but sister wanted to 'tidy'
Anna up--taking out pins, according to nurse.


"Finally sister returned and led me in. Anna was covered
completely by a white sheet--her legs now at rest. The
little sister ('You can come now, deary,' she had said
colloquially at the end of the ward) pulled back the top
end of the sheet.


"The sight caused me to start. The face was white where
the good skin showed--a deathly white like alabaster, with
the mouth very slightly open and the eyelids not completely
closed. I kissed her forehead, Simon went the other side--
and we prayed, kneeling.


"'Oh Lord, look down upon this Thy servant Anna ...'


"We prayed for strength for me and the children too:
and then also I said a prayer.


"'Oh dear, dear God ... thank you for giving Anna the
courage, the chance to live for these past five weeks. Thank
you for permitting her a chance to show her true spirit of
goodness, of concern for others, her generosity and thought.

[p. <i>243</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976813-I00253&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I kissed her twice on the forehead--felt the coldness of
the skin. Under the sheet the shoulders were going alabaster
white too.


"I picked up the prayer book Simon had lent me; I left
the Bible beside Anna. I gathered my jacket off the chair,
looked round once again--and left. Simon then brought me
home. I embraced him--as I had the night nurse who had
been so good.


"'Come and see us again,' she had said. 'Not that you
will want to.' And I kissed her cheek, held her shoulders,
thanked her for what she had done, for her goodness
towards Anna.


"The smell I can still remember--like a sweet brine."


Anna is dead. Her trial is over.
