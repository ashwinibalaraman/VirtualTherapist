BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay so I just wanted to check up and see how things are coming along with you since we talked last.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, well not to good I've had uh, difficulties with uh, mood swings.  Okay, I mean they're really happy or really sad right.  So, I'm not quite sure where that goes along with my illness uh, I guess I have a problem with my thinking.  As far as what I perceive to be true and what I perceive not to be true at times and um, I take medications for pain and I wonder if that affected my mood swings or if that is a truly, so to speak, organic problem in nature where I have a part of a bipolar affect.  Which I've been told that I do but not by you, yourself, you've never said that I'm bipolar.  But I've been told otherwise.  I -
<b>DR:</b> Well, there's a lot of over lap in symptoms what you call it whether it's <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> or bipolar.  It over lapse in the eyes of the beholder -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, you've been certainly treated for <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia2"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> for years and years and actually the fact that you've augmented your antipsychotic medication with Depakote would actually cover that because bipolar, uh, treatment includes Depakote.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So that is uh, a mood stabilizer anyhow and I'm assuming you've been taking your, your pills regularly?
<b>PT:</b> Yes sir.
<b>DR:</b> Okay -
<b>PT:</b> Yes I have.
<b>DR:</b> Are you on the pain pills or off the pain pills right now?
<b>PT:</b> Yes I'm taking them.
<b>DR:</b> Because I, I guess my way of looking at things is that you have this underlined illness, whatever you want to call it and, and these thoughts that you get and, and things that we've dealt with over time and I would almost bet that everytime you take that underline illness and then add pain pills, some of which are narcotics, which, which kind of cloud up and mess up your mind.  That it can bring out the, the symptoms from the underlying illness and make it get worse.
<b>PT:</b> Well what -
<b>DR:</b> So, I, I would caution uh, the, it's, it's a tough balance that we'd have to do.
<b>PT:</b> Well is there any medication that I can take that would give me the effects of the narcotics without being narcotics.  Like say being a more or a treatment of the highs and lows where I can feel more happy mood but not me taking those narcotics.
<b>DR:</b> I'm not sure I understand?
<b>PT:</b> What could make me feel like more on an even keel but not be taking something so drastic for pain and pain of mind also.  Do you know what I'm saying?  I mean is there like a medication for bipolar specifically that could treat even my mood level out that I wouldn't have the highs and lows of the narcotics.  But yet give me -
<b>DR:</b> I don't know that, that's a tall order.  I don't know that there's any guarantee.  You're asking me for a way to stay on your narcotics for pain and, and yet not have them cause what they cause and I, I think that's a better question to ask to your pain doctor -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Who actually left me a message saying that he was concerned about some of the effects that he's been seeing from some of the pain pills.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> He was concerned about, he had prescribed pain pills and he had seen some negative effects -
<b>PT:</b> Such as?
<b>DR:</b> With your mood and your psychiatric wellbeing and, and he was, I didn't talk to him.  He just left me a message saying here's what happened.  I prescribed the pills, this is what it caused I'm, I'm kind of hesitant because I know it can cause that.
<b>PT:</b> Right, cause what?
<b>DR:</b> The, the mood -
<b>PT:</b> Highs and lows?
<b>DR:</b> The mood symptoms and the thought symptoms.  It can bring those things out.
<b>PT:</b> But, you know, some of my thoughts I don't think are like that necessarily unreal because a lot of my mood swings have to do with my family and I see a lot of things going on there that I don't like and um, you know, a lot of times I think "well should I deal with this or should I flee?"  Okay, it's a flee or fight response or if I get mad.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So, I mean I'm, I'm dealing with situations that are happening to me also that aren't just related to my illness.
<b>DR:</b> I agree, I agree.
<b>PT:</b> You've said that for years.  So -
<b>DR:</b> There is an underlying illness and then different things that happen as you go through life, bring it out more, stress in your life, the family -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Other pills, other things that are in your body, different -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Things can make it or have an effect on it.  Can make it come out more or less.
<b>PT:</b> So, would you recommend that I try to get off of the pain pills, yourself -
<b>DR:</b> I, oh, I think knowing what, knowing what I know about pain pills and knowing what your pain doctor left me the message about that that's dangerous.  That, that's a dangerous way to go on account of what it might do to your psychiatric wellbeing.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum but what if I say "that I feel better when I take the pain medication."  It makes the pain go away, both physically and emotionally.
<b>DR:</b> I'd feel rich if I rob a bank.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> And, and I'd feel happy if I'd get high on dope but -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Just because you feel something doesn't make it right.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I mean how else to deal with it?
<b>DR:</b> That's what the pain doctor needs to talk to you about.
<b>PT:</b> That's what you need to talk to me about too, you're my -
<b>DR:</b> There's, there's -
<b>PT:</b> My emotional -
<b>DR:</b> Physical therapy -
<b>PT:</b> No I know that.
<b>DR:</b> There's nonnarcotic pills, there's exercises, there's all kinds of things that you can do but this is not a question of, gee I'm just going to take whatever makes me feel good, you know, or else I'd be showing up, up, on cocaine to work everyday and say "gee I feel high."  But you know, you can't say just because something makes you feel good that makes it right.  We have to go through life and, and except and understand and deal with some of the pain too.  Whether it's emotional or whether it's physical.  We can't always take the chance of popping a pill to uh, to make everything go away and I deal with this everyday.  You know, I work up at the hospital and on the Detox Unit and I'll tell you what half the, probably more than half the people who come in the hospital that are suicidal.  They're having real bad mood problems.  The time when they said they're suicidal was when they were high on something or drunk on something.  It's those substances that makes everything get worse and we have to get people and, and I'm afraid you fall in to that category.  We have to get them off of these psychoactive mind altering substances because they can send them spiraling in the wrong direction.
<b>PT:</b> I guarantee you that if I were to get off of the pain medication that I would not live at home.  I would totally, probably eradicate my entire situation at home because there's no way I could deal with it.
<b>DR:</b> Where would you live?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I uh, would get an apartment and I would, I already have one um, that I've tried to get one and um, I have to get my disability back before I can really move in to that direction but I really don't think that it would be anything I could stay at and um, I know it's uh, probably a cope out to say it but it's part of the reason why I stay there is because I can tolerate it right now.  Other wise I don't really know if I could.
<b>DR:</b> Now has that pain doctor discussed some of these same kind of things with you?
<b>PT:</b> I've talked to him about it yeah.  A little bit.
<b>DR:</b> So what does he have you taking now a days?
<b>PT:</b> Vicodin.
<b>DR:</b> And how often are you taking that?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, once every six hours as needed.  So once every six hours.
<b>DR:</b> So does that mean you're taking four doses a day?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And like I said "I don't know how much better you can do mentally, feeling these things that you're describing."  I don't know how much better you're ever going to do as long as you are on pain pills.  That, there's just one thing that counter acts the other.  Are you currently applying to get back with disability?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have to wait for uh, the judge to rule on it over payment ruling and then we'll see from there.  Like if I can, I'll reapply or not, if I owe them money then I can't, obviously and then um, after that is done then I'll reapply if it's, if I'm able.  If not I'm not uh, I have to get some kind of job, I don't know exactly what.  My license hasn't been totally eradicate, revoked from me.  Um, I still have um, July, it goes in to July but I can't testify for myself because I went past the date that they said that I could uh, apply for any kind of testimony on my behalf.  So, in order to even consider talking to any one they probably would want me to be, you know, not taking medication and uh, pain medication and getting help so um -
<b>DR:</b> And I don't care who you are, because of what I see on, on this Detox Unit.  There comes a time where you can't stay on pain medicine forever.  The pains going to be there with or without the pain medication because I see people addicted to high doses of pain pills and all they want is more pain pills because they say they're still in pain.
<b>PT:</b> No I'm not.
<b>DR:</b> So, at, at some point enough is enough.  You treat it for uh, how long you need to treat it as, as best as you can.  But you have to weigh the pros and cons.  Is that the same doctor that called me that's giving you the prescriptions now?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So he's keeping an eye on things?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I see him once a month.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum and he said he gave you some shots too?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah he gave me um, uh, epidural.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well maybe that helps too.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, epidural whatever they call that, I think, you know, the lumbar where the nerve was there but um, he says it's pinching on the, the disc is pinching on the nerve so, but I mean the pain is better.  I have to say that so I'm, I'm much better as far as the pain goes and that's a real good accomplishment for me because I hate pain, I really, I've got to the point where I just do not, I can't stand any hint of pain.  It has just been such uh problem for me and then when my daughter hit me over the head, bashed me over the head, she did something cervically to me too, so I get, I have uh, cervical pain too.  It's not like the pain isn't real, the doctor believes I do have pain, I think it's just at how it's, how I want to treat it or how I he thinks he should treat it is different from what I want.  I don't know, I don't know, I'm going to try to some yoga maybe and um, my daughter has me trying Capsicin P which is for nerve pain also.  Which does help so um, she wants me to stop, everybody wants me to stop taking the pain meds so but me.
<b>DR:</b> You know, as far as living at home, if you had a million dollars would, would you be at home or would you be -
<b>PT:</b> I don't know -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I don't know because I don't want to -
<b>DR:</b> Okay, what, what do you with that?
<b>PT:</b> Lose my, I don't want to leave my daughter but I do want to leave my daughter because she thinks exactly like her father thinks and he is such a good salesman that anybody would believe anything he had to say so.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you're on the pain pills right now so is, is the mood swing problem any better right now than it was before or is it any worse?
<b>PT:</b> Before what, before this medication or before any of them?
<b>DR:</b> No, no you, you said that "you're having trouble with mood swings."
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> That's the first thing you said when you came in -
<b>PT:</b> Yes uh-huh, so is it better -
<b>DR:</b> Then, then you said "but when I take my pain pills I feel great, I feel good, it makes me happier."  So well you're on the pain pills now are, are you feeling like those mood swings are gone and you feel happier or where are we at right now?
<b>PT:</b> I'm like a level, I'm even, on an even level right now and I'd say, "I'm not real happy."
<b>DR:</b> Because if, if we're at that level place I don't know if there's any necessary indication for use to go changing the, the prescriptions.  You asked if there's a pill that will work better when I'm on pain pills.  I don't know that ones better than the other.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> When you say being, having the pain under control being on this combination things are fairly level, I'm more inclined to not rock the boat.  Then to go trying all kinds of different things, um, I was just wondering though, have, have you ever been on Lithium?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Because that's another mood stabilizer -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> It's an alternative to Depakote.
<b>PT:</b> Right, what is, it's got a lot more side effects doesn't it, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Hum-um, there's just differences, there's not one worse than the other, they're, they're just different.  Depakote goes through the liver, Lithium goes more through the kidneys.  Depakote probably causes more weight gain and sedation, Lithium causes tremors and diarrhea.  So, it's just different potential side effects.
<b>PT:</b> I had been considered to be, to take it years ago and it was um, put on, put on hold.  I guess you have to have blood tests every so -
<b>DR:</b> Well you should have blood tests with Depakote as well -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So it's about the same.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, I just think something isn't right and whether it be the pain medicine maybe that's what it is but I just don't feel psychiatrically, I do sometimes I'd say but I don't others and I don't know.  I'm almost willing to make a change just to see what would happen, if it would get better or worse.
<b>DR:</b> If what would get better or worse?
<b>PT:</b> My, my mood swings.  My ups and downs but I know, you're telling my you just told me not to take the Vicodin and then my mood swings would go away basically right?
<b>DR:</b> And you said, you said it both ways.  You said that "the Vicodin makes you happy."
<b>PT:</b> But it makes me sad too.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Not just happy it makes me sad too.
<b>DR:</b> We could try switching you to Lithium and see if it helps the mood swings any better.  It's, it's equally as beneficial as the Depakote that you've been on.
<b>PT:</b> Let's try it -
<b>DR:</b> If you want -
<b>PT:</b> If you think we should.
<b>DR:</b> To try that.
<b>PT:</b> Should I, would I have to go to the hospital to try that?
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No, no.  Um, what, what are you feel in terms of the Stelazine.  I, I know you've tried different things there -
<b>PT:</b> I'm not real happy with it I'm really not.  Although my psychia, the uh, thoughts have been controlled so if that's what that's for then that's doing the job.
<b>DR:</b> Well it is, when I look back you've been on Seroquel, Zyprexa, Geodon, Abilify, and I want to say Respirdal?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> So, you've basically been on most of the newer ones -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you've always done better on the older one?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So, that is what it's for.  I, I think changing the Depakote over to Lithium would be the, the place to start.  But I, I think, I would hang my hat more on figuring out this thing with the pain pills.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, and, and you have a Detox Unit at, at your facility or where would you recommend I work through my pain medication doctor or how would that work?
<b>DR:</b> There, there is a Detox Unit at [DEIDENTIFIED] yeah.  Um, but you can always call them and talk to them and get, get uh, bed in there.  Um on the other hand I don't want to step on anybody's toes.  You may want to talk to the doctor who's working with you on this in the first place.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Either one of those are an option.
<b>PT:</b> Okay I'll think about it if that's okay with you?
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you bet.
<b>PT:</b> Excuse me.
<b>DR:</b> So instead of taking the Depakote.  I'm going to have you take the Lithium twice a day and then we'll keep you on the Stelazine.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So in terms of refills I want to say we, we need the Stelazine refilled and are you still getting the three months at a time and you're still taking three a day like, like we had you on?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, you send those through the mail or do you fill them locally?
<b>PT:</b> If I have the chance to if I get, I send them through the mail if I'm able.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have enough time to do that right now?
<b>PT:</b> Well with the Lithium no then I, oh the Stelazine, yes sir.
<b>DR:</b> Stelazine -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I think I'll just give you the Lithium through the mail and you can stick with the Depakote for another week or so and, and then switch.  I don't, I don't see -
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> Any emergency after you've been on it for all this time.
<b>PT:</b> See, I do.  Well, I do, see I really would like to switch right away if, can you give me like a prescription to get like 15 or something from the local pharmacy or is that too much -
<b>DR:</b> Well, we, we can, we can do that -
<b>PT:</b> Can you do that; because I would really like to switch.  I really haven't been feeling good and then I see the, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] next week so -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> We'll go from there, or would you rather I don't have uh, uh, never mind, never mind.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so three months of Stelazine I'm going to give you here to send in and then -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Why don't I just give you a couple of refills on Lithium to get locally, just -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Can you do it a couple of times locally when you first start.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I case I'm not -
<b>DR:</b> And I'll touch base with you in, we'll say, six to eight weeks after you've had a chance to meet the pain doc and try this long enough to get it in your system.
<b>PT:</b> Okay sounds good.
<b>DR:</b> You okay on, you've got to be okay on Cogentin?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.  I think I'll be take, I'll have enough to go until I die.
<b>DR:</b> You don't even take them everyday right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I do, I take one tablet -
<b>DR:</b> So take one, that'll give you a years worth last time, so you're -
<b>PT:</b> Something like that yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Okay, so Stelazine is written here and I'll give you that.  Lithium twice a day and I'll just give you a couple of refills for the local.  Are you doing any counseling these days?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> You still are?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm going to see her tonight.  With that, with my husband, which gets a little loud at times but we always leave.  He's been there once so we'll see.  It's good, it's a good opportunity to be on uh, uh, how you want to call, even  keel.  He is an always, screaming at me and everybody thinking I'm the bad guy all the time.  Gives a chance for me to vent too.
<b>DR:</b> Right and you still have your insurance now right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I do.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, here.  So, tell [NAME OTHER] to put us down for about six weeks or so late, late July.
<b>PT:</b> Late July okay.  Sounds good -
<b>DR:</b> I'm going to give you these prescriptions and see how the switch works for you.
<b>PT:</b> All righty.
<b>DR:</b> So ones for the mail and ones for local.
<b>PT:</b> Good, very good doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And thank you.
<b>DR:</b> You take care.
<b>PT:</b> You too.
<b>DR:</b> Stay well, well see you soon.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, bye bye.
<b>DR:</b> Bye.
