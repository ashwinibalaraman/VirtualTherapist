<i>A</i>s soon as Mrs. Lancaster and I arrive at the
Loring General Hospital, a young nurse in a neat white
uniform ushers us into the admission room. In a professional
manner she takes my temperature and blood pressure.
I glance about the small room, with its examination
table, grey metal supply cabinet and hospital-smell antiseptics.
Over the loud speaker a doctor is being paged.


A few minutes later a tall, impressive looking man steps
into the room.


"I'm Dr. Coburn," he says, as if to the room, overlooking
me. His voice seems cold, his presence detached.
He asks Mrs. Lancaster to leave.


"Now, tell me why you're here in the hospital?"


I can't answer ... I don't know why and I don't have the
energy to figure out why.


"Can you tell me what brought you here?" Dr.
Coburn's questions are demanding. I feel trapped. His dark
eyes are so serious they go deep into me and I'm compelled
to avoid his glance.


"You must know why you're here," he insists.

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Suddenly I realize I can't speak. Overwhelmed by all
that's happening, I think no words can explain my deep
sadness and depression.


I know only that there's no satisfaction in my life, and
that the world is a cold place where I'm being forcibly
detained. I want to hide away from all that exists. Seeking
relief from my feelings of despair, I wish only to sleep and
forget that I'm alive.


Dr. Coburn continues to press me for answers, but I
remain silent. Finding his efforts fruitless, he leaves the
room. The nurse helps me undress and put on a johnny.
Before I realize what's happening, Mrs. Lancaster is saying
good-bye and I'm being pushed in a wheelchair to the
elevator, then up to the sixth floor to the psychiatric ward.


The psychiatric ward is small with only three beds. Later
I learn it's an emergency care center for short-term patients
who are transferred to other facilities within ten days.
When we reach the ward a nurse takes my arm and helps
me onto a bed in the center of a room. The room is completely
bare except for a window with a heavy screen that
prevents me from looking out.


My bed is in full view of the nurses' station and I can see
them busy at their desk. Climbing into bed, I reach for the
covers and pull them over my head. The darkness feels good.
I'm safe, hidden away from the world. Hopefully nobody
will take me away from my warm, soft resting place.


As I lie under the covers, the voices of the nurses are
reassuring. Though I don't want to talk to them, I'm glad
they're there. They'll take care of me. It's good to have
someone else carry my life's burden. I'm secure ... and
totally dependent.


I remain in the psychiatric ward at the Loring General
Hospital for three days. During that time I do nothing to

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the morning of the fourth day, an ambulance
stretcher is shoved into my room and without any preparation,
I'm told that I'm leaving the Loring General for
another hospital. I'm scared ... no one is there to help me.
People are just milling around or passing me by, and when
they tell me to go somewhere or do something, they push
me. Although I can't understand why I'm going somewhere
else, I don't ask any questions. Inside the ambulance
I'm numb from anxiety and confusion. A nurse from Loring
General rides with me in the rear of the ambulance but
gives no comfort. Within thirty minutes, the siren is still
and we're at the Merrimac State Hospital.


I've never been in a psychiatric hospital like Merrimac
before. I'd heard of people going to the "nut house" but
had no idea that such places really existed. And to think I
could be in such a place! When I realize where in fact I am,
I become so frightened I feel myself shaking violently,
though I remain rigidly still. Mired in a stupor, I want to
run out the door, but can't move. The ambulance driver
and nurse from Loring leave me in the admission room.
I'm a wounded animal weakly struggling against the painful
iron of an unexplained trap.


A nurse helps me undress, giving me a johnny to put on.
As she takes my temperature and blood pressure, a young

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The doctor writes something down on a sheet of paper,
says something to the nurse and leaves. The nurse tells me
the doctor will give me a physical later.


"I'll need your clothes," she says as she takes them off me.
"The shoes and socks you can keep wearing. Your clothes
will be sent to the ward." As she speaks she wraps me into
a multi-colored bathrobe--at least two sizes too large.


In that bag of a bathrobe, I'm taken to West One. We
pass through the door and enter into a big day hall. It's
almost empty of furniture except for a few wooden
benches along the dark green walls. A ping-pong table is
set up in the center of the room and black iron bars line the
outside of the windows. The air is musty and the combined
stench of urine and disinfectant repels me, making
me feel dirty. Patients are standing around idly; their hospital
robes hang on them in disarray, here and there exposing
sections of their decaying nakednesss


I'm not prepared for what I've just experienced. To me,
hospitals are places where you go when you're physically
sick and leave when you're well. The nurses wear white
starched uniforms, with little white caps on their heads.
They move about an equally clean and white environment,
caring for the sick with gentle kindness. But I'm not sure
any kind of preparation would have been helpful. I'm
barely seventeen and terrified.


We walk into a small room that serves as an office. A
young nurse sits at the desk and looks up as we approach.
She's introduced to me as Mrs. Corcoran.

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"This is Ward One. I'm the head nurse here. Let me
know if you need anything." Mrs. Corcoran pauses
briefly, and looking at me for what seems too long a time,
asks, "Do you need anything?"


I remain petrified. If I respond at all to her words, I can't
tell. I'm in a daze, buffeted from the outside by frightening
sights, and from the inside by anxiety. I'm afraid to look at
anything or touch anything.


"You can go back into the day hall, if you like. Dinner'll
be in a few minutes," the head nurse continues.


As if released from my stupor, I leave the room and
walk into the day hall. There I meet up again with fear.
A disheveled woman about forty years old approaches
me. Her hair is stringy and unkempt--it looks like it
hasn't been combed for days. She has pancake make-up
plastered all over her face and bright red lipstick is smeared
outside the edges of her mouth. Her clothes, many sizes
too big, with their oddly matched colors, make her look
like a scarecrow. She stops in front of me, balancing jerkily
on her bare dirty feet. She looks grotesque.


I slowly move away from her. I don't want to speak to
her. I don't even want to see her.


"I'm Lady Esther. I'm sure you know that!" The woman's
voice catches me as she steps into my path. "I can help you, I
can make you better, you don't have to be crazy, to be crazy,
you don't have to be, I can be your doctor." Lady Esther
rambles on and on, shifting chaotically from foot to foot.


"This woman is crazy!" I think. "She's crazy ... and so
is every other patient in this room except me." My
thoughts race, "I'm not like these people. I don't belong
here ... I don't belong here."


I start to scream at Lady Esther to get away from me and
out of nowhere, several nurses rush to my side.

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I begin to sob loudly and my words pour out incoherently,
jagged and sad, "I'm not crazy ... I'm not really
crazy ... can't you see that, don't you see me? I'm not like
those ladies. Take me out, I don't belong here!"


The nurses hold me, tightly but softly. "You're all right
... we know you're just fine ... you'll be just fine," one
nurse says as she guides me over to a bench. She remains
with me for a while, calming me down. I become quiet.
Her presence is comforting, and my fears slowly go away.


It doesn't take long to become somewhat adjusted to the
surroundings. After the noon meal, student nurses arrive
in their gingham uniforms and white starched aprons.
They're refreshing after the dismal morning and soon I'm
talking to them, enjoying the attention I'm getting. We
play ping pong and toss around a ball. I ignore the other
patients, thinking I'll also be considered crazy if I associate
with them. I want to be different, to protect myself from
being called "crazy." It's easy for me to be different since
I'm the only teenager on the ward and, compared to the
others, able to carry on a normal conversation.


In the five short days I remain at Merrimac I become
very comfortable. I get used to eating my meals with a
large spoon, since forks and knives are not allowed. I get
used to the irrational and bizarre behavior of the other
patients and manage to get enough sleep even though my
bed is inches away from the babbling voices of others.
There are some night nurses who are mean-spirited, speaking
to us in harsh, demeaning language, abusing some of
the patients physically as well. But other nurses treat me
with understanding and that seems to make up for all the
negativity on West One. Soon I'm wishing I can stay on
the ward. It's a home for me. When the staff tell me I'm being
transferred to a hospital closer to my area of residence,

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My tears are useless. The very next day I'm sitting in an
official state car, on my way to another mental hospital,
Sutton State.


As the car approaches the town of Sutton, a huge building,
sitting high on a hill, comes into view. It's massive and
majestic, but forbidding. It looks like a rambling medieval
castle with its tall steeples stretching upward into the sky.
My stomach feels queasy and as we near the grounds an
uncontrollable fear takes hold of me. The car moves slowly
up a winding road. Beautiful tall elms line each side of the
road and I smell the freshly cut grass. The car stops and
the nurse who accompanies me from Merrimac steps out.
She leads me to the entrance of the building marked "Admissions."
What I soon learn to call the "outside world" is
left behind me as I anxiously, and with great hesitation,
enter Sutton State Hospital--called by patients and staff
"the Castle." The year is 1948. I'm seventeen.


In the admission room, the staff take all my clothing,
even my pocketbook and ring. An attendant in a grubby
white uniform with shoes run down at the heels comes into
the room. Unpacking my suitcase, she jams all my clothes
into a bundle to be sent to the marking room. All I can do
is wonder how I'll get the wrinkles out of my blouse and
slacks when I get them back.


"You can't have your shoes back for a couple of days,"
she says without looking at me.


I can't believe my shoes will be gone, but I don't have
the energy to object, and barely have the energy to put on
the pair of cloth scuffles she gives me. I tie the scuffles
around my ankles, but they're too big and I know they'll

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A doctor arrives. He sits at a table next to my bed and
begins writing on a sheet of paper.


"Do you hear voices?" he asks in a flat, distant tone.


I can't imagine what he's talking about, and my expression
remains blank.


"What month is it?" The doctor's question seems so odd
and cold. Does he really think I can't answer such a simple
question correctly? But again, I'm so surprised, I say nothing.


"What year is it?" he continues.


"Maybe I really am crazy if he asks me those kinds of
questions." I think, but all I can do is sit and say nothing.
I'm frozen with fear and confusion.


Finally, the doctor seems to lose interest in me and he
routinely takes my blood pressure and listens to my heart
and lungs. Without a pause, he proceeds to give me a brief
sermon on the virtues of good behavior. I listen but give no
response, not even a nod of my head.


"Take her to B-1." His words are an order to the attendant.
I want to ask the doctor, "What's B-1? What'll happen
to me there? Where am I going?" But before I can form
the questions, he's gone.


The attendant puts me in a wheelchair and pushes me
down through many long corridors, each containing row
after row of neatly made beds. At the end of each corridor,
a heavy brown metal door closes noisily behind us. As each
door closes, I feel the "outside world" fading further ...
and further away. I'm lost.

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

B-1, I later learn, is where all new admissions come
although the ward is almost totally filled with elderly
patients. All I see are old women shuffling around in confusion.
The youngest seems about seventy. They're milling
around, some of them in nightgowns and some of them
naked. I'm so stunned by what I see that I become numb
and my mind goes blank.


The attendant takes me into a room with a huge white
tub. "All new patients have to have a bath and shampoo
when they first come into the hospital." The attendant's
words are not reassuring.


As she starts the water running into the tub, she tells me
to get ready. I don't know what to do. Finally I feel compelled
to remove my nightgown, and as I stand by the tub,
I try to hide my nakedness with my arms. Embarrassed, I
climb into the tub and begin to bathe. I allow the attendant
to wash my hair--that feels good. But as I sit in the huge
tub, the voices of the old ladies resound in my ears and fear
fills the hollow of my stomach.


After completing my bath, I have to answer more questions
for my admission record. Then the attendant tells me
to go to the sunporch. "Could I have a cigarette?" I ask
meekly, even though I really need a cigarette since I'm a
smoker.


"Smoking only after meals and with supervision," the
attendant responds as she leads me to an alcove in the
center of the long ward and through a pair of double doors
into the sunporch. The sunporch has huge windows covering
one entire wall. There are no curtains, and except for
several wooden benches and straight chairs, the room is
completely bare. As I enter, I'm confronted by about fifty
old ladies wandering around going nowhere. I have to be
careful of stepping into puddles of urine on the tiled floor.

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dinner's at noon and it's mass confusion. The meal is
served on metal trays; the only utensils, large spoons. The
old women patients sit on wooden chairs and many of them
have spilled more food on themselves than they put in their
mouths. Abused by the constant shouting of the nurses,
they are crying pitifully. I drink a little milk and walk back
into the ward. I wait for smoking time to be announced.
After an hour, I'm led into the bathroom where three other
patients join us. They ignore me. We're each given one
cigarette. I try to make mine last as long as possible, smoking
it until I can't hold it between my fingers any longer.


"Remember that one ... the next cigarette won't be
until after supper," the attendant barks. I wonder how I'll
manage to wait so long.


After smoking time is over, a big tough nurse with red
hair approaches me.


"You have to return to the sunporch now!" Her words
leave no room for discussion, but still I wonder why the
other four younger patients, who are also on the ward with
me, don't have to go to the sunporch. My instincts take
over, and I tell the nurse I won't go.

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You'll go ... and if you don't, you'll be sent to A-2."


I don't know about A-2 but sense it must be pretty bad
if the nurse is threatening me with it. Yet, I can't budge
from my resolve.


"You go to hell," I blurt out, and immediately panic as
I imagine the consequences of those words, regretting they
ever came out.


The red-headed nurse gives me a frightening look and
walks away. For about a half hour I sit shivering, expecting
the worst. I feel sick to my stomach and want to vomit.


Without any warning, a group of nurses comes charging
through the door of the ward. They're coming toward me!
I'm terrified. Two of them grab my arms and push me out
the door; the others follow closely behind. My screams and
tears are futile as they drag me up the stairs. Before I know
it I enter what must be Hell and I just want to die!


Ward A-2 is dismal looking. With its poor lighting and
dull yellow walls, it's like a dark cellar that's been raised to
an upper floor. There is a long row of beds against the wall,
each with a yellow bedspread pulled tightly across it. Otherwise
the room is bare, with the exception of a small table
at the end serving as a desk. The stench of disinfectant and
urine stifles me, and the shouts of attendants drown out the
cries and moans of the disturbed patients. In an effort to get
a shine on the floor, two patients are pushing a polisher by
its long wooden handle. To the right of the ward is an open
doorway to the sunporch, which is now blocked with a
wooden bench. Through the door I see women in institutional
dresses that fit like large sacks with an opening at the
neck. As I look around, I feel sick in my stomach--such
a place seems inconceivable. What's happening to me? I
can't understand it. But here I am, in the back ward of
Sutton State.

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The attendants deposit me in the sunporch. Their keys
hang loosely from chains wrapped around their waists. I
feel as though I'm in a prison. Some of the patients are
walking in a circle around the sunporch. Their loud
screams hurt my ears. They're all ages and many are
naked. Conversation with most of them is impossible, for
they're mentally deteriorated. I sit in a corner, trying in
vain to ease my intense fright. I see no hope of escaping
from my situation and feel it's useless even to suggest that
I want to return to B-1. That's what really disturbs me.


The afternoon hours go by. I remain in the sunporch
until 2:30 P.M. when a new crew of attendants comes on
duty and removes the bench from the sunporch doorway,
allowing us to leave.


Mealtimes provide the only diversion, especially since
I'm allowed to help with the evening meal. I set up the
tables, serve food, and then wash the trays and spoons.
The attendants are pleased that I'm helping, and I soon
learn that doing such work is the only way to get in their
good graces. Because I've helped, I'm allowed to smoke.
Again smoking is restricted to the bathroom. As several of
us smokers stand in a corner of the bathroom, patients
come in and out to use the facility. All toilets are visible
with only a partition between them for privacy. A couple
of patients pee on the floor right in front of us. An attendant
comes toward them, shouting furiously at them to get
a mop and clean up the mess. We carry on our own business,
smoking our lone cigarettes, trying to remain cut off
from the pitiful plight of those women splashing their own
urine about with their uncoordinated mopping.


In spite of the terrible condition of A-2, I become
absorbed by that back ward environment and the shock of
being there subsides. I still want to leave A-2 and ask often

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now as I look back on that time, I'm amazed and saddened.
I needed so much to feel accepted and taken care of
that I sought and found some comfort even in the midst of
the oppressive environment of the back ward.


The evenings on A-2 are more pleasant than the daytime
hours. Most patients climb wearily into bed at five P.M.
and sleep soundly until it's time to arise at four-thirty A.M.
The evening crew are friendlier and have more time to talk
to those of us who can communicate. It's during those
quiet evening hours that I also become aware of the seclusion
rooms. I hear the pounding on the seclusion room
doors and the garbled shouting of those who cannot safely
be let out on the ward or who are sent to seclusion as
punishment. It would have been easy to observe the
patients in seclusion rooms through the small window on
each seclusion door, but I stay away, afraid I'll see more
than I can stand.


At 9:30 in the evenings I climb into the bed assigned to
me. The beds in the ward are less than a foot apart, and I'm
engulfed by the disrupted sleep of others. The rubber mattress
is stiff and musty. Even the pillow is unyielding, for
it's made of straw. At 10 P.M., when the night crew arrives,
the first sounds I hear are the slamming of the door and the
jingle of keys. Those sounds haunt me for a long time--
I never get used to them. As I try to sleep, the cries from
the seclusion rooms punctuate the quiet, darkened ward.
The night nurses set themselves up in comfortable chairs at

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On my second evening in A-2, at 2:30 in the morning, I
have to go to the bathroom. The bright bathroom light
that's kept on all night blinds my eyes momentarily. A
couple of patients are huddled in a corner sneaking a cigarette.
They have evidently stolen matches, which is strictly
forbidden. I join them for a smoke. My heart is pounding.
I know I'm breaking a rule and can be severely punished.
As we stand there smoking, a figure appears out of no-where
and fills the doorway. We're caught! Guilt and fear
come at once. I'm glued to the floor. Another nurse comes
in and they grab me roughly by the arms, drag me to a
seclusion room, and shove me in. The door slams. I'm
completely alone with only a rubber mattress on the floor,
an indestructible blanket, and my nakedness. My nightgown
has been ripped off and taken away.


I throw myself down on the mattress, cover myself, and
begin to sob uncontrollably. As the darkness of the room
engulfs me, I ask God to please take me. I beg Him, telling
Him I'm not afraid to die. I wait, but nothing happens.
When I realize that death is not coming, I just lie there and
gradually my tears subside. I remain awake the rest of the
night. At 6:30 the door opens and I'm let out--shaken and
confused.


Breakfast soon arrives and I put the horror of the night
behind me. I hope that this day I can return to B-1. Much
to my surprise, I'm taken there that afternoon. I'm glad to
be back, sensing my freedom there.


There are abusers in the back wards and the front wards
too. But there are also those in the front wards who are
sympathetic to me. When I come back to B-1 it doesn't
take long to learn who the "good" nurses are. As soon as I

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The following day goes in the same fashion, and I discover
that work is really the solution to the hated sunporch.
I'm never kept there again. The head nurse on B-1
insists that the younger patients be productive; otherwise,
out to the sunporch they go! I remain in her good graces
for the rest of my stay there.


On my fifth day in Sutton State Hospital I meet Dr.
Pearl. She tells me that I'll be going to the staff conference
the next morning. At the conference the hospital doctors
determine whether to commit or discharge the patients
who are admitted, as I've been, on a "pink paper" for a ten
day observation period.


"Marie, you might be discharged tomorrow." Dr. Pearl's
words are kind, but they make me very anxious. "I really
don't think you're sick enough to be here at the Castle," she
continues. "You belong back home, outside. Do you want
to go back to your home with the Bartellos in Gloucester?"


Ma and Pa had not been notified of my admission to
Sutton State since I'm now eighteen and no longer a

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I don't want to go back to Gloucester," I reply without
hesitation. "I think I should go back to Mrs. Lancaster in
Boston. She'll find me a place to live."


I'm glad when Dr. Pearl agrees to my plan, but the real
truth is that I don't want to leave the Castle. I know in my
heart that Dr. Pearl is right. I'm not sick enough to be in
the Castle. I'm not like those other patients, but still something
in the Castle is drawing me in. Though I've spent
only five days on B-1, I've already come to value the
security and personal attention I experience there. I'm not
a free agent at the Castle and the surroundings are depressing,
but I'm willing to give up my freedom to stay there.


I miss being able to have a snack whenever I want, and
sleeping late in the morning. I also miss the privacy of a
bath and being able to use a toilet without someone watching
over me. I particularly miss the luxury of a toilet with
a seat. Yet I would choose to remain in the Castle.


That night I don't sleep well. I'm anxious about leaving
and worried about my future. I also worry about the staff
conference. Morning comes too quickly and at eight
o'clock I'm sitting in an anteroom next to the hospital's
main conference room. The thought of going in and being
questioned scares me, and I feel nauseous. Within a few
minutes Dr. Pearl comes out, greets me, and leads me into
the conference.


The room is filled with people--doctors, supervisors,
social workers, psychologists, head nurses, and student
nurses. I keep my head down as Dr. Pearl ushers me to a
chair that is placed in full view of all. I quickly sit down.

"Do you want to die?" The doctor's question hits me
unexpectedly. I'm deeply embarrassed. My words become
hardly audible, and I can't be sure he can hear my soft

I'm like a laboratory animal being dissected before a
large audience, like an insect ready to be crushed by people
in white coats. My emotions are overwhelming and when
the doctor begins to ask me about my life growing up in
Gloucester, my eyes fill with tears. I bite my lower lip very
hard so as not to burst out crying, creating a worse scene.
I'm aware of all the people sitting attentively in front of me
and can feel their eyes staring at me. When they finally tell
me I can go, I get up from the seat and walk steadily out of
the room. Later that morning they tell me that I'm discharged.


At one o'clock I say good-bye to my new-found friends
in the Castle. I try to be cheerful, but I sense even then that
it isn't a final good-bye.
