<i>"A star cascaded across the sky and collided with the earth, and
the heavens were brighter for its having fallen."</i> Chris (Blind
Lady): January 1958. Thus did Jane live and die. To have been
born so spectacularly, and to have struggled so valiantly to live,
Jane's death was notably inconspicuous; she just, without warning,
ceased to return. Chris's period of blessed solitude, however, was
short-lived.


Chris and Don had traveled around the country long enough
now, following construction jobs, that they began to encounter familiar
faces when they pulled into new trailer parks; and when
they pulled into LaPorte, Texas, they were especially happy to
find their old friends Tom and Sarah Byrd. Sarah was the only
real friend Chris had made of all the people she had met on her
long cross-country treks, and she now desperately needed a friend.
Having just undergone her surgery, she was physically weak and
frail; and having just lost Jane, she had no one to "turn to" when
she encountered obstacles. Sarah, a competent outdoors woman
who could as easily change an automobile tire as bake a cake,
had exactly the traits that complemented Chris's fearful lack of
confidence and her insecurity. With Sarah to support her, she
might have had a long period of peace had not the old specter of
death brushed her again.


Stricken with Asian flu, she was seriously ill for several days.
Sarah, who generously tended her needs and cared for her family,
related to her recuperating patient one day that a small boy in the
trailer court had just died with flu. Chris's reaction to this news

[p. <i>376</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00405&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Chris, what's the matter?" Putting her hand on the flushed,
damp forehead, she urged, "Let's get you back to bed; you've just
gotten up too soon."


Chris lay limply against the pillow, appearing to be almost in a
faint; but when the eyes opened, they were calm and clear, showing
no trace of pain or weakness. They looked curiously around
the room as if they had never before gazed upon these familiar objects,
a behavior that concerned Sarah far more than had the sudden
attack of pain and illness. The lightning physical recovery was
remarkable enough, but the mental about-face was even more
startling.


"Is everything all right, Chris?" Sarah asked, watching her
friend closely. "Can I get something for you?"


"Oh, no, Sarah, thank you," the voice, calm and confident, assured
her. "I'll just lie here and rest awhile." The eyes gazed out,
controlled, knowing, inquiring; and they, coupled with the disciplined,
cool voice, made for a demeanor and an atmosphere that
Sarah had never before observed in her usually shy, dependent
friend. She was to see several of these eerie changes, and though
never in any way alluding to their strangeness, she must have
known that Chris had an unusual problem. No other explanation
would account for the obvious, basic changes in her personality
and behavior.


<i>That was the Bell Lady, And she was an entirely new and
different one. She was certainly not Jane. I know Jane had just
left, had been gone only a few weeks; but this one was not anything
like Jane--just the opposite. This one was very mature
and motherly. Jane was vain and selfish; the Bell Lady was generous
and civic-minded, and she was ugly. She knew she was
ugly and she simply accepted it, never worrying about it. She
was just</i>... comfortable! <i>She was called the Bell Lady because
she collected bells. She thought the sound of bells was the most
beautiful sound in the world. She was the first one who collected
things, and I know why she came, too. She came because</i>

[p. <i>377</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00406&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Here began a period of peace and calm for Chris and, thus, also
for her family. It was a sustained period not only devoid of hurtful
conflict but also filled with meaningful activity. But, once unhappiness
has paid a visit, its cloying stench is never completely
cleared from the nostrils. The suffering of the mind gathers momentum
as it quickens, and time does not erase the mind's ability
to suffer, ever anew, each exquisite pang. Once anguished, a being
becomes pensive, pondering not only the mysteries of ill fate, but
those of good fortune as well; knowing full well that they are, irrevocably,
opposite sides of the same coin.


As the Bell Lady, Chris reached her peak of maturity, losing her
restless striving for what was beyond her grasp and magnifying the
long-neglected treasures languishing at her fingertips. She developed
her artistic talents through ceramics, poetry, and sketching,
winning prizes and ribbons whenever she offered her creations for
competition. The fact that she felt sufficiently confident to enter
her work for competitive judging indicated a drastic change from
the shy, insecure Blind Lady. She developed an interest in politics,
national and local, became very civic-minded, and worked diligently
as a Girl Scout leader. She spent long hours in musty old
shops appreciating antiques that Jane would have considered junk
and of which the Blind Lady would have been totally unaware.


During this period she became pregnant. It did not occur until
almost a year after her surgery, and just when she was about to
lose hope. Having maintained her contact with Dr. Barfield following

[p. <i>378</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00407&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One incident, only, marred this tranquil period. While she was
waiting to turn left from a busy street, her car was struck from the
rear by a careless driver. An immediate thorough examination determined
that her unborn child had escaped injury but that her
own back and shoulder were damaged, greatly magnifying her
chances of aborting the four-month pregnancy. Above all, she
could not travel; she had to change all of her plans for returning
to Augusta for the birth. This was a difficult adjustment for her
and caused one awkward change. She was in the doctor's office
and had just been told that under no circumstances could she
travel several hundred miles to give birth to her baby. Bitter disappointment
engulfed her; she felt suffocated and faint, her head
pounded, and the room turned black. When she opened her eyes,
her amazement was utter: She was lying naked under a sheet in
an examining room. As she gazed around the room trying to
orient herself, she felt strange movements in her stomach, and
placing a hand on her middle, she was astounded to discover its
enormous size. Tentatively, she ran her hand over the tight, protruding
belly, finally gathering enough courage to look down at
the round bulge under the sheet. As she did so, the strange movement
within her was repeated, causing the sheet to mysteriously

[p. <i>379</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00408&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Are you all right, Mrs. Sizemore?" he inquired.


"It's a baby, isn't it?" she softly asked.


"It certainly is! It is very much a baby!" the doctor declared. He
was perhaps accustomed to the strange behavior of women caught
in the wonder of a live child's voluntary movement within their
bodies. He smiled indulgently at her, unaware that he had just
witnessed a woman awaken to find herself seven months pregnant
and willfully pummeled from within by a child she had not conceived.


<i>It's the Blind Lady. I can remember how she felt, how surprised
she was. She loved Don so much and wanted so much to bear
his child, and now she awakes to find that another woman has
conceived his child and is carrying it in</i> her <i>body. Because it</i> was
<i>her body, too! Did that make it her baby, also, even though she
had not been in the body when it was conceived? And what
about giving birth to the baby? Is the one who gives birth the
mother? What happens if one conceives the child and the other
gives it birth? Which one would be its mother? And what
about me? I have the body now. Does that make me the mother
also, even though I neither conceived nor gave birth? But
a body is a body! A child</i> could <i>be conceived and given birth by
a body that was mindless. Does that mean that it is simply the
body that is the mother, not the mind? A mind is not simply a
mind, as a body is simply a body. The mind</i> is <i>what it experiences.
If it does not experience the conception and birth of the
child, it is not the mother of the child. But what about the
Blind Lady? She neither conceived nor bore, but she carried the
moving embryo in her body, she felt it move, she fed it with her
own life's blood. Was she not also the mother?</i> ...


The change lasted for several days. The Blind Lady, unable to
even observe the activities of the Bell Lady, could experience only
if she were out, and she was so fascinated by the growing child
within her that she fought to remain out. She constantly felt and
examined her body, laughing in childish delight when the child
moved or kicked. Don seemed unaware of this change, thinking

[p. <i>380</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00409&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A major concern, since she could not return home for her
confinement to doctors who knew her history, was that the
trauma of birth might cause a recurrence of her problems. She decided
to tell her doctor who she was. Don went with her, and
seated in the doctor's office, she began,


"Doctor, there is something we feel you should know about
me: I am Eve of <i>The Three Faces of Eve."</i> She paused. The doctor
looked at her with a completely expressionless face.


"Dr. Thigpen of Augusta, Georgia, wrote about me. We
thought you ought to know, since sometimes unpleasant experiences
precipitate changes in personality." She stopped. The doctor
showed no reaction; he only continued to make notes on his
paper.


Whatever Chris expected from her doctor, what she received
was nothing, absolutely nothing: no comment, no expression of
surprise or disbelief; no smile or friendly pat on the hand; nothing.
And, fortunately for her, nothing was needed; it was a perfectly
natural childbirth. On May 24, 1959, Bobby, her dark-haired,
blue-eyed son, was born. There were no complications and
no changes. The Bell Lady gave birth to her child as she did everything
else, quietly, confidently, and without undue excitement.
It was several weeks before the much-weakened Blind Lady returned,
and, strangely, it was again in the doctor's office while
lying on the examining table. For no apparent reason, the headache
struck and the change occurred. As soon as she felt her flat
stomach, she became hysterical, crying and moaning,


"My baby, my baby! Where is my baby?"


The doctor, surprised, but judging this to be only some postpartum
disturbance, hurriedly brought in Taffy and the baby who
had accompanied Chris. Seeing Taffy holding the tiny blue-garbed
baby, she asked,


"Why am I here? Who is that baby?"


"You came to see the doctor, Mother," Taffy answered. "This
is Bobby, our baby." She held the child for her mother to see.


Chris looked at the small sleeping face and grew calm. She had
not lost her baby! She was, however, so embarrassed over the
scene she had created that she could not bring herself to return

[p. <i>381</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00410&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For two years there were no changes, the longest such period of
her entire life, and the greatest contributing factor was her home:
She finally got a house, her <i>own</i> home. When Don had first
learned of his approaching fatherhood, he had immediately
bought a larger trailer; then, shortly after Bobby's birth, finding
that the construction work was good and, seemingly, plentiful for
the future in the Washington, D.C., area, he decided to sell the
trailer and buy a home. It was a lovely little white house, surrounded
by green lawn on a settled street shaded by huge old trees
in Vienna, Virginia. Far from her childish remembrances of the
Strother place, it still satisfied her. It had spacious rooms, a wide
yard for flowers, a fireplace, and above all it was located in a permanent
community. It met her needs.


For the first time she cultivated friends and enjoyed a social
life. Theirs was a heterogeneous community, peopled by both professional
and blue-collar. Chris preferred the more intellectual,
idea worker, while Don gravitated to the "workingman." Thus,
though six years married, they discovered for the first time that
they differed widely not only in their choice of friends, but also in
their philosophies about life in general. Chris's new interest in
things civic and political caused her to disagree with some of
Don's heretofore ignored union activities, a question they were
never to solve between them. It was healthy! She was no longer a
confused, clinging dependent who selfishly contemplated her own
needs. She was able for the first time to place herself into the
proper perspective of things and to look with objective interest at
the offerings of her world.


While she and Don were beginning to communicate, though
not always agree, on surface matters, on the deeper, more fundamental
subjects they never even touched. For two years they lived
in their house, and Don knew that she was happy, but she never
told him that it was the anchor of the house itself that allowed
her the freedom to grow. She now had roots that nourished and
sustained her, and provided the permanence she so desperately
needed. Her lack of confidence demanded present security; while

[p. <i>382</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00411&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At about this time she met Dr. Ham, a man who was to become
not only her physician but her friend as well, and who
would lend her his considerable strength through years of frustrated
pain. Tibor Ham, a general practitioner, ironically entered
her life through the Yellow Pages of the telephone book as a result,
not of her own illness, but of Taffy's. A man of infinite
dignity, both professional and personal, his small, impeccably
groomed figure soon became for Chris a bulwark of strength and a
haven of security. She did not at first tell him who she was, there
was no immediate need, and when she did finally have to tell him,
he replied to her in his characteristic manner,


"All right, my dear. Tell me about it."


A bond was established. From then on she could tell him anything
and know that he accepted it with neither surprise nor disbelief.
He protected her and encouraged her, and though from
time to time he insisted that she seek psychiatric help, he never refused
to extend to her whatever aid was available to him within
the bounds of his medical expertise. She trusted him and could always
count on him for thorough honesty.


"Dr. Ham, will I ever be absolutely well?" she once asked him.


"My dear," he solemnly replied, "I do not deal with that kind
of absolute."


When she needed him, he was there. Her other stanch friend
and constant support was her daughter Taffy. Always a sweet,
well-behaved child, she had at fourteen become seriously dependable
and conscientious. She remembered her childhood as a most
pleasant time in which Acie and Zueline played a very strong part,

[p. <i>383</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00412&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The relationship between them was strange, it was reversed; and
neither of them seemed to question it. Taffy was obviously the
stronger and more stable of the two, yet she never took advantage
of her strength and position. Though gentle and respectful to her
mother, she never hesitated to be firm if that quality were needed.
Chris, in her turn, leaned heavily on her tiny daughter, yet never
abrogated her position as mother. They developed an unusual
closeness through the years, with neither seeming to recognize either
the strange nature of their relationship or the rare quality of
their affection.


Taffy, always a happy child, was especially contented and well
adjusted in the little house in Vienna. She had many friends, was
active in Scouting and sports, and was elected a cheerleader for
the athletic teams. She loved Bobby very much and never felt that
his coming in any way threatened her position in the family.
Often visiting her loved grandparents, she was delighted when
Acie and Zueline once came to live with them for an entire winter.


Only Don wanted a change, and he thought he was doing what
was best for his family. He could not have realized when he sold
the house in Vienna that he was shattering, perhaps forever, this

[p. <i>384</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00413&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Her troubles began immediately. The gradual weight gain,
begun before the birth of Bobby, had ballooned during her pregnancy,
and instead of losing after the birth, she had continued to
gain. While she was happy, her obesity had worried her little;
after all, she had borne a son, had a home, and was now contentedly
growing mature and plump in the bosom of her loving family.
She knew that her weight was unbecoming, but she was complacent
with indulging herself. This comfortable complacency
concerning her self-image was the first of her qualities of contentment
to go, as her happiness evaporated into the thin air. Suddenly,
she was not motherly and matronly, she was ugly.


In the midst of her growing unhappiness, her father had a cerebral
hemorrhage, a stroke, and almost died. For days he lay unconscious
and at the point of death, and then he began to rally. It
was a long journey back, and Acie never fully completed the trip.
Though his mind was clear and his thoughts as agile as ever, his
right side was paralyzed and his speech slurred for the remainder
of his life. After weeks in the hospital he was allowed to return
home, where Zueline devoted herself entirely to his care. This constant
physical and mental strain soon ruined her own health, causing
her to develop angina pectoris within a few short months.


Since they had so thoroughly enjoyed their visit in Vienna, as
soon as Acie was able to travel, Don brought them to Manassas,
hoping that the change of scene would benefit their health. But
the scene had vastly altered, and circumstances were different

[p. <i>385</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00414&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"The married women in my family don't work," she informed
him. "You just want to make a common woman out of me."


"Chris, the women I know about work and help their husbands.
If we could get some money ahead, we could buy a larger
house and move away from here." He reasoned with her, but to
no avail.


Finally, she told him that she would work if she had her own
business. Since she knew about materials and could sew garments
beautifully, they decided on a fabric shop. Borrowing six thousand
dollars, they rented a shop, stocked material, and bought seven
machines on which Chris could teach prospective customers to
sew. Bobby was dropped off each day with a baby-sitter, and all
might have gone well if this had not been such a traumatic experience.
Chris had so nurtured the relationship between herself and
the child that he protested any separation from her, and each
morning he had to be torn screaming from her grasping arms, a
heartrending experience for both mother and child.


Soon she was blaming Don for this problem.


"You're taking me away from my son by making me work," she
declared. "If you had not sold my house in Vienna, this would
never have happened!"


"You're always throwing that up to me!" Don struck back in
anger and frustration. "Most wives try to help their husbands get
ahead."


The shop, which had gotten off to a good start, began to suffer.
Although she had a woman to help with the work, Chris's own irregular
appearances to instruct customers caused her sales to start
a steady decline. Some days she was too sick to leave the house;
some days she could not force herself to leave the screaming
Bobby with his sitter, and simply returned home with him. He
soon developed an amazing battery of allergies that, of course,
were highly manifested when he became so upset. Chris abruptly

[p. <i>386</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00415&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Into this confused scene the Virgin was born. What does a man
do when he slips into bed beside his wife of almost ten years, and
she turns to him a face filled with surprise, slowly changing to
fright?


"Who are you?" she yelped, shocked, her blue eyes staring and
dilated with terror. "What are you doing here?"


She jumped from the bed and backed against the wall. Keeping
as far from his motionless figure as possible, she edged around furniture
until she reached the door; and there, turning her back for
the first time, she fled from the room. Don remained as her incredible
actions had caught him, his head spun, his breathing was
slow and shallow. Suddenly he drew a long, shuddering breath
and dropped back against his pillow. How much was there going
to be? How much could he stand? They were not appropriate
questions; he now had two children to care for; there was no question
of his enduring anything for their sakes. He had made a mistake
about the house, he knew that now; but it was too late, there
was no going back. He simply must carefully control the future,
making decisions in the light of his reality, not in the light of a
man with a normal life. He did not follow his wife. Hearing her
fleeing footsteps on the stairs, he knew that she had not left the
house, and that she had run to Taffy.


"There's a man in my bed!" she wildly exclaimed as she burst
into Taffy's room. Her eyes stricken with fear and her body trembling
uncontrollably, she sank down onto the startled girl's bed.
Taffy asked no questions; she put her arms around the shaking
figure and held her close.


"It's all right," she soothed. Only a lifetime of exposure to such
erratic behavior could have prepared her to so unemotionally accept
this impossible scene. Almost instinctively Taffy knew who
the "man" was, and just as automatically she did not question

[p. <i>387</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00416&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Can I sleep with you? I can't go back down there. Please, lock
the door."


"Of course," the girl answered. "Now, just go to sleep, and everything
will be all right."


Taffy was reassuring her mother with her own philosophy of
how to deal with intolerable problems: Just go to bed and sleep,
and everything will be fine. She watched as Chris fell into a troubled
sleep, twisting and turning and moaning, as if even in sleep
she were pursued and terrified by her waking fears. Does sleep
block out the tortures of the mind as it does the tortures of the
body? Or does it simply toss the demented into a chasm of confusion,
where the laws of logic are unknown and chaos reigns unchecked?
Taffy, observing her mother's tormented writhing, would
have awakened her except for fear of the physical harm she might
inflict upon herself. Thus, to protect the body from physical
harm, the mind, locked in sleep, was permitted to wreak havoc
upon itself.


Taffy stole from the room and went to her father.


"It's all right, Daddy," she told him. "She's asleep now."


"That's good, honey." They sat silently for a while, neither
knowing how to express their thoughts. No words were adequate.


"Your mother is sick, Taffy," Don began. "She has been sick
for a long time--probably all her life." He was facing facts himself
that he had for years denied. "I thought she was well. The doctors
said she was well. But she is still very sick."


"I know, Daddy," the child encouraged him. "Nanny told me
she was sick."


How could he explain it when he didn't even understand it
himself? "You know the movie you saw, <i>The Three Faces of Eve?</i>
Well, that was written about your mother. And the book she
wrote with Mr. Poling, that was about her, too."


"Really, Daddy?" Taffy was impressed. "She's famous."


"But nobody knows who she is. And we can't tell anybody.
Nobody would understand, and people would not accept us if
they knew. You must not tell anybody, not even your best
friends."


Don paused; he had trouble involving this innocent daughter in

[p. <i>388</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00417&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He could not ask her to take on this unfair chore, he could only
explain the problem. She understood.


"I'll do it, Daddy," she solemnly promised. "I'll help you."


And so, in the still of the night, the man and the child made a
pact. They silently agreed to pick up the discarded life of a
woman and to protect her from her most vicious enemy: herself.


At fourteen Taffy, with the conscientiousness that only a child
can bring to a task, took over her duties as mother to her little
brother, monitor to her mother, and lieutenant to her father. She
thought deeply about the movie she had seen, and when viewed
in the light of her mother's life, it became extremely offensive to
her. Her mother had never behaved like Eve Black! Taffy rejected
it totally. She read only a small part of her mother's copy of <i>The
Final Face of Eve,</i> rejecting it also. That was not her mother, either.
Becoming very protective of Chris, she made small effort,
thereafter, to enter into the activities of her peers, explaining that
her mother was sick and needed her at home. When Chris tried
to explain her bizarre behavior, Taffy cut short the embarrassed
attempt,


"It's all right, Mother," she reassured her. "I understand about
it. Daddy explained everything."


So Chris was spared even the unpleasantness of facing the need
to explain her condition to her daughter. After the advent of
this new member, Taffy had three personalities to deal with: the
insecure, dependent Blind Lady; the capable, overprotective
Bell Lady; and the prudish, depressed newcomer, whom Taffy
promptly named the Virgin, because she denied being Don's wife
and refused to sleep with him. They had only one thing in common:
All three were desperately unhappy and blamed Don for
their miserably depressed state. The changes now came often and
easily. Though always accompanied by the accustomed headache,
dizziness, and nausea, no longer was anything dramatic necessary
to trigger the process. Taffy became so familiar with the traits of

[p. <i>389</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00418&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The Virgin considered herself to be in her late fifties, about
twenty-five years older than the other two; and her mid-Victorian
ideas caused her to dress very plainly and to wear no makeup.
When she went out, she always sprayed her hair white from a can
of cosmetic hairspray, which the others would immediately wash
out when they emerged. When several changes occurred in one
day, most of the time was spent changing clothes and redoing
hair. The Virgin was totally lacking in skills, being unable to
cook, keep house, or drive a car; and she rejected any family relationships,
referring to Don in the third person and to Bobby as
"young'un." She scolded everybody, but it was on Don that she
especially heaped her anger, taking him to task at every turn.


It was into this confused scene that Acie and Zueline, both invalids,
came for an extended visit. Only a year before, they had
spent several months with their daughter, and it had been a pleasant
time of sight-seeing, card-playing, and talking together. This
time the change was immediately apparent. They, with near horror,
watched their daughter rapidly switch from youth to old age,
and from a shy wife to an overprotective mother to a raging
shrew. As a result of all the turmoil, Zueline had an angina seizure,
upsetting both herself and the paralyzed Acie to the point of
tears. Chris became immediately contrite and even oversolicitous,
but the damage was done; the invalided couple could not endure
such extremes of emotion, and they left for home after less than
two weeks, never again to return to their daughter's home.


Shortly thereafter, Chris was involved in another accident, of
exactly the same sort as the one before: Her car was struck in the
rear while she was waiting to make a left turn into her shop. Sustaining
a severe whiplash and reinjuring her old shoulder damage,
she was hospitalized by Dr. Ham for ten days. She had been seeing
him periodically for several years for her problems, for which
he had prescribed alleviating medication; but it was only at this
point that they felt it necessary to inform him of who she was.
His calm acceptance of her won her confidence and lasting trust,
and though psychiatrists came and went through her life, he remained
the constant stable help she came to reply on so heavily.

The accident plus the long period of sedated inactivity left her
in a highly nervous state. They had made only two lasting
friends in Manassas, Bucky and Fran Kemp; and Don, attempting
to shake Chris out of her unhappy state, arranged that the four of
them go to a stock car race. At a break in the racing, a demolition
exhibition was performed; and as the cars began to crash into each
other, Chris's composure cracked and deteriorated with every tearing
scream of rending metal. Each ripping screech sent a jagged
shard through her being, thudding her heart, splitting her head,
and dimming her eyes. Overcome, she fell heavily off the bench
and onto the feet of spectators. Her eyes immediately opened,
revealing fear and rejection so intense that the look faded even as
it sharpened. The lids dropped frantically, only to open again on
blue orbs clouded by confusion and anxiety. As they gazed up at
the faces bending forward, a thunderous crash of cars shook the
stands. Abject terror darkened the wide blue eyes and a high-pitched
scream of unreasoning fear tore from the constricted
throat. The eyes closed, the contorted face smoothed, color flowed
back into the marble cheeks. When the lids raised again, they
revealed calm, mildly questioning eyes that scarcely flickered at
the grating sounds of the multiple crashes.


Don helped her up, explaining to the Kemps that he had better
get Chris home. They agreed, believing that she simply had not
yet fully recovered from her accident. The rapidity of the changes
plus the general noise and confusion of the race had masked most
of the incredible happening, and possibly the Kemps were totally
unaware of what they had witnessed; but fearing a recurrence of
this disturbing behavior, Chris and Don completely ceased their
social life.


<i>Two of them were born at the same time. It was so fast; her
face was like a kaleidoscope. There were so many it's confusing
to separate them. It was the Bell Lady who went to the races
and became frightened of the crashes. No! No, it couldn't have
been the Bell Lady because the others could not come out
through her; it had to be the Blind Lady at the race. There is
always one, the pivot, in each group whom the others come
out through, and it was the Blind Lady in this group. When
the Blind Lady fainted, the Virgin made a brief appearance</i>,

[p. <i>391</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00420&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Chris was at work several days later when the telephone rang.
At the time she was talking with a friend, a barber, whose shop
was just up the street, and drinking a cup of coffee that he had
brought to her. The call was from her cousin, a truck driver, and
he was asking for her help, explaining that he had just been involved
in a wreck. At the word "wreck," both the coffee and the
telephone dropped from her nerveless hands and she slumped
heavily to the floor. As she lay there, her throat worked and
corded, and her face flushed painfully. The man bending over her
fascinatedly watched the face grow still and white and the blue
eyes open, calm and unperturbed.


"Hello," she greeted him, as casually as if he had just walked
into the store, as if lying on the floor in that manner were not at
all unusual.


Unnerved by this eerie calm under such exciting circumstances,
he helped her to a chair and beat a hasty retreat, murmuring
something about "waiting customers." And that was the demise of
the Blind Lady. As Chris sat in the chair, her three remaining personalities
revolved flashingly through her burning brain, the two
new ones inexplicably absorbing memories and experiences stored
in the common receptacle. One gathered some skills, bents, and
tendencies; the other chose different ones. When it was over, two
separate and distinct personalities lurked within the being, ready
by turn to motivate the dumb, pliable flesh.


<i>Was that the way it was always done, this kaleidoscoping and
absorbing of information? Or was this the first time? I can't
remember clearly about the others, the earlier ones. Some of</i>

[p. <i>392</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00421&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Within days the new personalities had demonstrated their dominant
traits to the point where Taffy could easily recognize them,
and it was she who dubbed each with a distinguishing name. The
new pivot became fascinated with turtles and began to avidly
collect their images in all sizes and compositions. She would
squeal with delight on encountering a turtle reproduction and declare
that she just had to have it. The other personality fell in love
with playing cards and began a career of acquiring decks of all
kinds, colors, and dimensions--even round. Taffy named the first
the Turtle Lady, and the second, the Card Girl. A collector is
striving to organize, to put things in order. Poor Chris; was this
thread, which ran so true throughout the fabric of all her personalities,
an attempt to organize her own scattered selves?


At this very bleak period in her life, Chris and Elen's paths
cross briefly. The cousins had seen each other only for minutes,
several times in ten years, and their knowledge of each other had
been by way of sketchy information passed on by relatives. Chris
wrote, perhaps annually, but, of course, her letters revealed only
trivia, nothing of her deep, torturous problems. Elen, a miserable
correspondent, wrote scarcely at all.


They met at the open casket of Elen's father. At seventy, Ellis
had been retired for ten years. He was in excellent health and had
just bought a house in Edgefield so that he and Mamie Lee could
more easily spend considerable time near Acie and Zueline. The
four of them loved to sit and recall times past, reliving and laughing
over their many years together. Driving cross-country in
March 1963, Ellis and Mamie Lee were involved in an automobile
accident that critically injured them both.


Elen, hurrying down from Chicago to watch over her parents in
the tiny Macon County Hospital in Alabama, cared for them for
ten days before Ellis died. Then she took them home to Greenwood,
her mother in an ambulance to the hospital, and her father
in a hearse to Blyth's Funeral Home. Mamie Lee, hospitalized for
nine weeks with multiple injuries, underwent surgery the very day
of the funeral; Laura, though married and the mother of a small

[p. <i>393</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00422&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Suddenly there was Chris. She said nothing; she simply pressed
Elen's hand, and Elen was no longer alone. The clan gathered,
and for the most part it was Ellis's in-law clan--the Hastings family.
He had lived among them for more than forty years, and they
showed their love and acceptance by bestowing on him their
highest honor: an eternal resting place among their own precious
dead. He was placed amid military honors in the same plot with
Papa and Mama, who had died peacefully only a short three
months earlier. Tears coursing down cheeks for Ellis that day were
generously intermingled with those for Mama, whose so recent
death still left raw, painful grief. Elen knew that Chris's tears
were not only for her and her loss, but also for her own loss. He
had been her "Unc," and they had loved each other even before
Elen was born. And he had loved Chris all her life, lending her
his help and support at her times of dire need. Who had a better
right to ride in the first car with his daughters as they followed
their father to his grave? Elen asked her cousin to ride with her,
and the Family clucked in disapproval. As usual, it was Chris who
got the blame instead of Elen. It was talked about for days that
"Christine should have known better than to ride in the first car!"


The death of Mama started a march of death that was to wipe
out seven members of the Family in four years before it halted.
Myrtle, gentle, compassionate, and uncomplaining, died shortly
after, after ten years of suffering; and within another year, Zueline,
wracked and wearied by her painfully constricted heart, died, leaving
her Acie paralyzed and helpless. Chris was totally incapable of
accepting her mother's death, coming as it did during one of her
weakest periods and immediately following a most debilitating experience.


Don, most concerned over Chris's state of health and her increasing

[p. <i>394</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00423&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Do you have your diaphragm in?" he cautiously asked.


"Yes, of course, Don," she answered.


"Are you sure?" he pressed, watching her closely for strange behavior.


"I'm sure!" she answered crossly.


"Are you sure everything is all right?" His concern would not be
allayed.


"Of course I'm sure, Don!" Gathering anger stained her voice.
"Don't you trust me?"


He could go no farther. To continue would spoil the lovemaking,
the very act that the diaphragm was intended to enhance.
Even this small encounter had brought to the experience a tenseness
that made it less than completely satisfying. And shortly,
Don's suspicions were proved well-grounded. Both of the new personalities
were fragile, webby constructs, containing weaknesses
fatal to their growth and development Existing in a make-believe
world, the Turtle Lady fantasized people and events, preferring
the world of her mind to the world of reality. Taffy often observed
her posturing and murmuring endearingly before a wall,
while caressing and bestowing impassioned kisses on its smooth,
blank surface, no more featureless, however, than her own unformed
façade. Extremely interested in sex, and preferring lonely

[p. <i>395</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00424&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The Card Girl was a thief, shoplifting cheap, inconsequential
items that struck her fancy, Very hardworking and dutiful, she
lived in deep, debilitating depression, believing strongly in fortune-telling
and living daily by astrological charts.


And this was Don's wife: a fantasizing suicide alternating with
a thief controlled by her superstitions. The tension created by this
duo was only occasionally relieved by the appearance of the comfortably
normal Bell Lady.


It was the Turtle Lady who put in the diaphragm, and it was
the Card Girl who came out and mischievously removed it. The
Turtle Lady, unable to observe the actions of the Card Girl, was
unaware of the trick that had been played until her interrupted
menstrual cycle heralded her pregnancy. Don was understandably
furious.


"You lied to me, Chris!" he thundered. "You told me each
time that you had the diaphragm in."


"I did, Don!" the innocent Turtle Lady protested. "I had it in
every time. Something just must have gotten by."


"That's not true. Dr. Ham told you it would work if you wore
it," he countered. "You just deceived me. Why do you do things
like that?"


"Why are you accusing me? I did use it." Hurt and confused,
she began to weep.


"Well, we don't need another baby. And we can't afford one either."
Just as hurt and confused as she, he was unable to comfort
her. His wife had deceived him; how she did it was of small consequence now.


"I won't have the baby, then. I'll get rid of it!" she struck back.


Shock cleared Don's head; he could not believe his ears. "No,
no, Chris, we can't do that. It's all right, we'll manage somehow."
Whether a baby was planned or not, if one were conceived, it
was a member of the family already and would be loved and

[p. <i>396</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00425&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Don and Taffy left the next morning, she searched the
house for something lethal with which to kill herself. Finding a
bottle of turpentine, she drank it and blacked out, but she did not
fall. Her senses cleared, and her eyes opened on the empty bottle.
Connecting it with the burning discomfort in her chest, she gradually
lowered her lids over quickly glazing eyes. When the eyes
opened again, she surveyed the scene, looked carefully at the
empty bottle, and grew dark with anger and fright. Hurrying to
the kitchen, she made a strong mixture of salt and water and
drank it down. In a moment she was retching violently, and the
smell of turpentine filled the air. Her head ached violently, and
her stomach cramped and knotted in its violent effort to disgorge
itself. She closed her eyes and slumped quietly to the floor. In a
moment the eyes opened again and she knew immediately what
had occurred, that she had been forced to vomit her deadly drink.
She was weak and trembling, but that was fine; perhaps the violence
done to her body would discharge the fetus as well.


<i>That was the Turtle Lady who drank the turpentine, and the
Bell Lady came out only long enough to see what was happening.
She couldn't deal with it, she left; and she never returned.
She never came back again. She had been growing weak ever
since the other two came out. She couldn't deal with their
shocking behavior, the stealing and the perversion, and now suicide.
Their bad qualities actually killed her off. Then the Card.
Girl came out long enough to save the body and then left, forcing
the Turtle Lady to suffer the physical results of her actions.
It's all so confusing, like a madhouse. These two are crazy, really
crazy! What did I need them for? I couldn't have been
doing</i> this <i>myself. Nobody would deliberately turn herself into
such obnoxious, despicable creatures. And these are only the
first of the disgusting ones</i>....


In desperation she sought help from Dr. Thigpen, who after
hearing her request suggested that she come to Augusta to discuss
the whole matter with him. He admitted her overnight to his psychiatric

[p. <i>397</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00426&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I can understand your wish, Chris," the gynecologist informed
her, "and Dr. Thigpen approves, but I cannot do it. We worked
too hard to make you fertile. I'm afraid the time will come when
you will regret this, and I don't want you to blame me. When
something like this comes up, you're emotional and not always
aware of what you're doing; but I <i>do</i> know what you're doing."


"What can I do, then, Dr. Barfield?" she asked, near tears.


"I do know someone who, I think, might help you," he promised
her. "Dr. Robert Greenblatt is in practice with me. I have
spoken to him. You need to talk with him."


Dr. Greenblatt performed the uneventful surgery, which included
a partial hysterectomy, and after several days, Don came to
take her home. It was a silent trip; in fact, it was almost six weeks
before he talked to her about anything other than absolute necessities.
How did they feel about aborting their child? It is psychologically
different from simply deciding not to conceive a child,
for after its conception, even at the moment of its conception, its
traits and characteristics are fully set. The decision not to join the
sperm with the ovum is somehow intricately different from deciding
to terminate the result once joined. It was these thoughts and
the sight of Bobby, the child they had once made together, that
interrupted their normal ability to face each other squarely.


Death could not have chosen a less opportune time than when
it again visited Chris. She received a call from her sisters that her
mother was scheduled to undergo a gall bladder operation. For
more than a year, Zueline had periodically been hospitalized for
her heart condition, and Chris, though knowing that her mother's
condition had gradually deteriorated, was not unduly alarmed.
Zueline weathered the surgery, and for a week continued to regain
her strength and good spirits. After talking with the doctor, Chris,
assured that her mother was out of danger, returned home. Two
days later, Zueline died.


Chris returned to a heartbreaking scene. There sat Acie in his
shining metal wheelchair, frail and wan; his dark skin, bleached
out by the long illness and confinement indoors, showed its blue
network of veins. His look of fragility was magnified by the sad
blue eyes, looking strange and alien without their usual merry

[p. <i>398</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00427&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Chris found strength where seemingly there was none to be
found; and for the sake of her father and her Aunt Meme, she was
calm, too calm. Acie himself selected his wife's last garments, and
he dressed her all in blue. Zueline, somehow, still looked like the
child she had been all her life, with her uncut hair, which had
long since gone salt and pepper, wound into a fat knot atop her
youthful face, a face that in death appeared no more pale and lifeless
than that of her husband of nearly forty years, who sat beside
her casket in his wheelchair, unable to even look on her still face
without help.


That night, her first night dead, Acie wanted to go home, back
to the house he had shared with her. It was past midnight when
Chris, followed by Mamie Lee and Laura, brought him back to
his empty house. Helpless even to disrobe himself, the three
women got him into the big bed, where his thin, emaciated frame
scarcely rippled the covers.


Looking down at him, perceiving his thoughts, Mamie Lee's
ravaged heart broke.


"Acie, do you want me to lie down beside you, so that your bed
won't be so empty?" Her low voice was choked with emotion, for
Acie and for herself; her own bed hadn't been empty long. She
knew what he was feeling.


"No," Acie answered her. "I'll be alone from now on. I'll have
to start getting used to it." Their eyes met; only they knew what
had been shared and what had been lost.


Dr. Dunovant, passing the house on his way from a late-night
call, saw the lights and stopped.


"I saw your lights," he said, "and stopped to see if I can help. I
heard about your trouble."


They asked that he look in on Acie to determine his condition.

[p. <i>399</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00428&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The eyes of the gathered clan were perhaps wetter than usual as
the wan, bent Acie in his wheelchair followed his Zueline to her
final resting place. Mamie Lee remained by his side, holding his
hand; and their sharing seemed to render their own grief more
bearable. But the family, seeing these two together and remembering
how close the two couples had been, grieved doubly for both
their lost mates.


Chris watched all this, and her anxiety and tension built to an
insupportable load. She did not break, however, until she took her
father back to the cemetery the following day. As she stood there
looking down at her mother's grave, knowing that she lay there
under all that earth, looking exactly as they had seen her yesterday,
but also knowing that she would never see her again, Chris
felt the cool, green spring day shimmer as if in deep summer heat.
The familiar headstones turned crazily, the tall, straight pines dizzily
upended, and her head thundered and buzzed. She heard her
father say,


"I guess I'll have to go to the nursing home now."


It was too much. Holding onto her father's chair, she felt cold,
thick darkness engulf her, but she did not fall. Suddenly the
bright yellow sun was back, and the dizzy world had set itself
aright again. She felt young and gay and lighthearted. It was
spring; nothing could be really wrong in spring!


"Oh, no, Dad," she answered him cheerfully. "You can live
with one of us girls. I'll take you home with me."


Acie looked at his daughter, at her happy, smiling visage on
which no trace of grief showed, at her matronly figure and face
out of which a childishly immature voice rippled, and his own
face registered a deeper resignation to the whims of life. Why had
they so whimsically claimed his agile, happy wife, so tortuously
twisted the mind of his lovely young daughter, and left his own
mind clear and unscathed in a twisted, useless body?

[p. <i>400</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00429&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No, Daughter," he quietly responded to her offer. "I must stay
here close to Mother."


Shortly Chris appeared to be herself again, but enough of the
anxiety had been drained off by this interchange that she was no
longer unbearably immersed in black depression. For a short moment
she had rolled back time, had regressed to a happier, less
complicated age when Mother was to be found simply by seeking
her.


<i>That was the Banana Split Girl, and now I know why she had
to come. She brought back childhood simply because the others
could no longer tolerate the problems of mature people. They
could not bear the finality of death, so she went back to childhood,
before the death occurred. What must Daddy have
thought, seeing her behave that childishly when he needed mature
support to lean on? She was no help to him at all; she only
saddened him. Or was it</i> me <i>behaving like an irresponsible
child? Did Daddy think that it was me? Was it me? Oh, no!
Surely I would not have done that to my father, to my mother,
to</i> myself! <i>But I know all about it, all about what they</i> all <i>did;
and I even know</i> why <i>they did it. Would I know all that if it
hadn't been me?</i>...


Chris returned home completely incapable of running her business.
She sat for hours in deep study, oblivious of her surroundings,
unresponsive to her family; and she moved in and out of personalities
so quickly that her conversations, often with strangers or
tradespeople, took startling turns, switching ideas in midsentence.
When Don or Taffy attempted to correct her mixed impressions,
she became violently angry. Soon Chris was not able to deal competently
with other people, in business or social encounters.


Don sold the business, paying off whatever debts he could, assuming
the rest on a term basis. At about that time, the house was
condemned for his veterans' mortgage loan because the property
did not meet flood control standards; and seeing his opportunity
to eliminate another irritant to Chris, he sold their home and
rented an apartment in Fairfax. If it were possible, she was even
more unhappy in the apartment than she had been in the house;
Bobby's allergies had worsened to a frightening point, and he was

[p. <i>401</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00430&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Their world was falling apart. In quick succession they were involved
in two automobile accidents. In the first, Chris, alone, was
struck by a speeding taxi, which totally wrecked the car and put
her in the hospital for several days. She was so nervous and distraught
that Dr. Ham insisted that she be seen by a psychiatrist,
who sedated her for days to force rest and quiet on her hyperactivity.
Within two months, just before Christmas, a second accident
befell the entire family, in which Don suffered a broken
back, Chris and Taffy received multiple cuts and bruises, and only
Bobby, through Taffy's quick action, escaped harm. Chris and
Don were both hospitalized for several weeks, leaving Taffy to
care for Bobby, get both herself and the child ready for school
each day, and shop for Christmas presents. Her parents came
home from the hospital on Christmas Eve to find the tree
trimmed, the house stocked with holiday food, and Santa Claus
ready to make his visit to six-year-old Bobby.


The next four years settled into an incredible routine, with the
four of them living together in the small, cramped apartment, yet
each following his own miserable path. Bobby, beset with myriad
allergies, was unable to participate in boyish activities or even to
play outside except in the best of weather. Don's concern over his
son's health was frustrated into anger over Chris's smothering protection
of the child, which he felt was a contributing factor to the
boy's condition. Teen-age Taffy passed resoundingly into her rebellious
stage. Strangely, however, this expected juvenile cantan-kerousness
was aimed at her father, with whom she had a normal
relationship, and did not affect in the least the abnormal, reversed
role that she played with her mother. It was as if she played out to
the finish the child role with her father, but on another plane, entirely,
she continued her performance as the mature guardian of
her emotionally juvenile mother.


Chris, at Don's urging, applied for a job as manager in a dress
shop, the first of many such positions she undertook over the next
few years. They desperately needed the extra money to help pay
off debts from the dissolved business, and Chris excelled at the

[p. <i>402</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00431&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Don often built plans around Chris's ability to excel at her
work and to earn substantial salaries. He once decided, when everything
seemed to be going well, to buy a new car to replace their
ancient, worn vehicle. He discussed it with Chris, and she urged
him to proceed, declaring that her job was secure. Don bought the
new car; but within two weeks, Chris collapsed at work and refused
to return, leaving Don with not only new-car payments and
new medical bills for Chris, but also the loss of her salary. How
could he be expected to understand such behavior? She did not
look sick, she had no broken bones, she was not feverish or weak.
Why could she not work as other women did? This was not a
kind of sick that he could sympathize with; it more resembled unwillingness
than inability. He felt betrayed.


On these occasions, after quitting a job with no warning, she
would be ill for weeks, completely out of touch with reality and
needing constant medical care. Dr. Ham usually sedated her at
home, but he occasionally hospitalized her for a few days. Twice
her condition became so severe that he insisted she see a psychiatrist,
even threatening to dismiss her as a patient unless she followed
his advice. The first of these psychiatric consultations was a
miserable failure. She seemed absolutely incapable of again completely
entrusting her mind and her emotions to anyone.


In December 1968, Taffy married James Thomas Fecteau, but
she did not desert her mother. Always living close by, Taffy spent
many of her days with her mother, doing her own work at night.
Tommy, a mild, quiet man, was completely understanding, and
never once complained when Don called for Taffy to come to stay
with her mother. And it was quite often most unpleasant. Chris's

[p. <i>403</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00432&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The only calm person on the scene was Chris. Opening her eyes
and finding herself lying on the floor amid this bedlam, she was
completely disoriented and simply lay still, attempting to determine
where she was. No one seemed to notice that all her anger
and hysteria were gone and that a sad, passive woman lay on the
floor.


<i>It's the Purple Lady. She came so quietly that no one knew she
was there, and she remained silent for a long time, just watching
the others and absorbing information from them. Not even
the other personalities knew she was there. Then how did I
know?</i>...


Even after her son, Jimmy, was born, Taffy bundled up her
baby, left her own home, and spent the day carefully watching her
mother to protect her from harm. She never knew what she would
find each day when she arrived. The deeply depressed Card Lady
slept most of the time, falling into such deep slumber that she
neither ate nor drank. The frivolous Turtle Lady kept mostly to
herself, fantasizing with her imaginary lovers or writing numerous
wills. Taffy had to watch her closely to abort her many intricately
planned suicide attempts. If the Banana Split Girl happened to
come out, Taffy simply had two children to watch. Irresponsible
and self-centered, she was a willful, spoiled child who vied with
Jimmy for Taffy's attention. She ate only banana splits, often consuming
several at one sitting. She crammed the gooey concoction
into her mouth with both hands, smearing it all over her face. As
she ate, she crowed with delight, laughing and squealing as might
an ill-mannered child of five.

"Ooooh, that's good!" she giggled, awkwardly and messily
smearing her face with her napkin. "I want another one!"


If Taffy protested, this naughty child in a middle-aged woman's
body grew angry and had a temper tantrum. What could Taffy
do? She could spank Jimmy if he so behaved, but she could neither
reason with nor spank a grown woman--her own mother!
Often this scene was played out in public, where Taffy could only
sit in embarrassed silence until this obstreperous Chris satiated
herself and retreated, leaving Taffy to deal with another Chris,
who suddenly found herself nauseated by the excess of sickening
sweetness in her stomach and had to be rushed someplace to
vomit.


Once Taffy and Chris drove to Edgefield to visit Tiny and
Becky. While stopping at a filling station for gas, Chris suddenly
began to laugh gaily and delightedly. Taffy, who had never learned
to drive, was shocked to hear her mother say,


"I can't drive."


Taffy looked at her in amazement. Chris giggled, put her hands
experimentally on the wheel, wiggled comfortably in the seat, and
said,


"You just tell me what to do."


And Taffy, who had never driven a car, instructed Chris, who
had been driving ten years, in how to start, steer, and control the
vehicle. Even though she knew that the knowledge of how to
drive a car was locked in her mother's head, she did not know if
this giggling caricature of her mother would be able to use it.
When they arrived at Tiny's, the badly frightened Taffy declared
that she would not risk her child's life by returning with Chris.
Tiny, unaware of her sister's desperate condition, scolded Taffy
for her attitude; and a confused quarrel followed, ending with a
call to Don and Tommy in Virginia. While on the telephone to
Don, Chris, before Tiny's stunned gaze, changed from a docile,
loving woman to a raging shrew. Realizing her sister's condition,
Tiny tried to persuade her to see Dr. Thigpen, but she adamantly
refused.


It was a terrible trip for Taffy. Whenever they stopped someplace
Chris stole small, inexpensive articles; once it was an antique
perfume bottle, another time it was a paper bookmarker. They
stopped by Mamie Lee's house on the way home, and Taffy was

Shortly after this trip, Chris secretly hoarded her carefully doled
out sleeping pills until she had collected a lethal dose, and only
Taffy's constant vigilance prevented her scheme from working.
Surreptitiously, she followed her mother into the bathroom and
surprised her preparing to swallow the pills, some of which were
already in her mouth. Horrified, she knocked the pills from
Chris's hand and then slapped her face smartly to force her to spit
out the rest. Trying to black out, Chris closed her eyes and leaned
against the wall, waiting. Nothing happened. She opened her eyes,
terrified; then quickly closed them again, and waited. Nothing.
She began to weep hysterically.


"What have I done? What have I done?" Her body shook uncontrollably.


Taffy took her in her arms and held her close. "It's all right,
Mother. It's all right," she soothed, just as she soothed Jimmy
when he hurt himself.


<i>That was the Turtle Lady who took the pills. When Taffy
found her she tried to leave and make the others come out. But
there</i> was <i>no one. The others were gone. Where did they go?
They never came hack again. I don't know when they died, or
when was the last time they came out. I just know that the Turtle
Lady tried to get them, and they were gone. The Purple
Lady is there, but she never comes out, and the Turtle Lady
doesn't know about her yet. There were some who did that
when I was young--just disappeared. I thought, perhaps, I just
didn't remember what happened way back then. But I remember
this all clearly. They just suddenly were not there. I
remember how lonely the Turtle Lady felt, just as I feel now, so
lonely</i>....


Dr. Ham hospitalized Chris for a few days to allow her to
recover, but before she was fully on her feet again, two events occurred
that proved to be too much for her to handle in her weakened

[p. <i>406</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00435&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It happened in the church during the funeral. Seated beside the
pale, weak Don, she felt herself retreating, slipping away. The
minister's voice grew distant, faint; the air was suddenly suffocating
and dense; she closed her eyes and settled deeper in her seat.
The eyes opened slowly, almost surreptitiously, and the slumped
body straightened, vibrant and strong, and the head raised slowly.
Her eyes fell first on the flowers; she had never seen flowers before,
and she was absolutely fascinated by the red and white and
pink carnations. She stared at them, unable to tear her gaze away
from their colorful blossoms; and when Don rose and took her
arm, she smiled at him gaily, happily. Even at the graveside, she
stared at the flowers, smiling mysteriously to herself.


That night, the family ate at a restaurant, and Chris, completely
ignorant of a menu, asked Don to order for her. As she was
eating her fish, a waiter passed with an order of strawberry pie on
his tray. Chris, spying the red strawberries and white cream,
pointed and exclaimed,


"That's what I want! I want that to eat! It looks like flowers."


Don, embarrassed, spoke quietly to her, "That's dessert, Chris.
We'll have some later."


"Then I'll wait," she joyously announced, and pushed back her
mundane fish to await the glamorous pie.


When it arrived, she clasped her hands like a small child and
cooed over the luscious concoction, picking it apart with her fork
and experimentally tasting each morsal with zest and rejoicing.


On the trip home, Chris exasperated everybody, even Bobby, by
constantly searching for places to eat strawberries, whether fresh,
in ice cream, or in pie. She ate nothing else.


<i>The Strawberry Girl. Another death, another personality. The
pattern becomes increasingly clearer. When the pressure becomes</i>

[p. <i>407</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00436&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Chris's life became a living hell. It was as if all the demons of
bedlam had been loosed within her. The two selves battling
within her were truly Jekyll and Hyde. As the Purple Lady she
was fifty-eight years old, her mother's age at death; and she was
obsessed with all things purple, Mamie Lee's favorite color. She
not only felt herself to be a misfit among people, but her body
also felt strange and misshapen, with elongated extremities dangling
awkwardly from a round, bloated body. Painfully modest,
she was humiliated and frightened by her counterpart, the twenty-six-year-old
Strawberry Girl, who talked to her and taunted her
from inside her head. She would attempt to placate her tormentor
by buying her' anything strawberry that she desired, but to no
avail. The maliciously mischievous voice laughed at her purple
clothes, her white wig, and her misshapen body. The Purple Lady,
never feeling clean, continually bathed her body; and the Strawberry
Girl waited until she was in the tub before she began to
taunt her,


"I see your pussycat," she teased, laughing vulgarly.


The poor modest Purple Lady tried to cover her naked body
with the washcloth.


"It'll take more'n that little ole washcloth to cover that big fat
body," she sneered. "Look how your flabby ole tits hang. You look
funny with white hair and that black pussycat. Where'd you get
that black pussycat?"


The Strawberry Girl did not seem to realize that the same body
that housed her victim was also her own body. She rejected the
size and weight of their common body, considering herself, even

[p. <i>408</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00437&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The shocked Purple Lady began to cry. "Please, leave me
alone," she begged.


"You're a funny ole bitch," laughed her tormentor.


Nervous and upset, Chris went to see Dr. Ham, but she was unable
to tell him the full story, only that she became very upset
when she took a bath. He gave her some pills, instructing her to
take them shortly before her bath, to relax her. As she was preparing
to take the pill before her bath, the voice warned,


"If you take that medicine you'll go blind."


Chris, ignoring the voice, swallowed the pill, and immediately,
to her horror, she was totally blind. The voice laughed.


"I told you! I can do anything to you I want to. That ole doctor
can't stop me!"


Chris's misery was unrelieved. She was so afraid of the voice
and what it could do to her that she never resisted when it wanted
to come out of her head and take over her body, even though she
was unable to see what was happening and was sure to take the
blame for any mischief done in her absence. At this point, Dr.
Ham insisted again that she see a psychiatrist, and over her strong
protest, he sent her to Dr. Tony Tsitos. Prepared to be uncooperative
and resistant, she was won over by his open, friendly air
and his first statement.


"I know all about your problem, my dear; Dr. Ham has told
me. We are going to talk about it."


And talk about it they did. At first she saw him twice a week,
with all three personalities attending the sessions; and strangely,
all three liked him and each thought that he was working to make
her the surviving one. A glimmer of light entered her dark life
when Chris found this doctor; here was help and hope. Almost simultaneously,
another ray shot through the blackness engulfing
her. Elen contacted her, requesting permission to relate their life
experiences together to a public group; and not realizing that
Chris had kept her identity secret all those years, she was expecting
to use Chris's real name. It was an opportunity to emerge
from hiding! Her hand also rested on a third light in the dark tunnel,
if only she had courage to turn it on. Her only close friend,

The way was open. Professional medical help was at hand, an
opportunity awaited to live openly and normally, and a medium
in which to express her soul was ready for her hand. Could a
woman who had for almost half a century run from life do a complete
turn and face it squarely? Her soul quaked at the very
thought, but her last shred of logical reasoning posed the question
"What is my alternative?" The answer was unmistakable: insanity!
