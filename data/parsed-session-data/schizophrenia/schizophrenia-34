It is only by pressing our ear ever closer and
closer to the unceasing murmur of our experiences,
as a child fastens its ear to a singing seashell,
or as it might sit up in its narrow nursery
cot to heed in the lonely stillness of a black night
the barking of a fox, that we shall come by a
knowledge that will fortify, nay, even in sudden
fortunate flashes, enrapture us, during the short
time that we have to live.


<i>Wheels on Gravel</i>, Alyse Gregory


I HAVE reached my early fifties despite having made two
attempts on my life. The first, had it been successful, would
have ended my career just before I was twenty. An interval of
nearly thirty years separated the attempts. An extraordinary
circumstance preserved my life on the second occasion, and I
was resuscitated when, by the law of nature, I should have
been beyond recovery. Both attempts have a kind of bizarre
absurdity about them that is so totally in keeping with my
character that it is impossible not to think that there is a lack
of seriousness about me which prevents such attempts being
successful.


Apart from this clownishness which perhaps makes it difficult
for death to keep a straight face in my presence, I have an
obtusely strong constitution.


I have now lived for two years. I regard them as an endurance
test. I have no feeling of having been ‘given another
chance’ or ‘making a fresh start’. I do not believe that my
life has been preserved by any divine intervention or for any
supramundane scheme. I do not think, even, that I have
changed radically by reason of this momentous break in my
life, but I have learned a great deal. I see it as a massive blow

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00010&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I write this I feel myself to be on a ledge. No one else is
near me, and I am by no means out of danger. Unless or until
I make a third attempt to destroy myself, I must lay hold of
anything I can--my sense of peril, my awareness of the abyss,
my total isolation--and make use of them. Were I to wait, to allow
these giddy sensations and wind-hovering thoughts to settle,
they might, it is true, be processed into a novel. But on my solitary
ledge, I do not feel inclined to wait any longer than I must.


I am writing an autobiography which begins with the death
of its author. I cannot foresee how it will end for I am living
it as I write. It is not a book in which a single well-known
person will appear, for I have known none. It will be incomplete,
for your personality is like the moon. You will never see
more than one side of it. In a sense other than scientific it will
be true, for I believe with Epicurus that every man is his own
canon of truth, and in this book I endeavour to see myself with
my own eyes and report what I see. Identity is something bestowed
by others. I cannot easily present myself as I appear to
those who know me. The truth lies not in a picture of myself
but in being. What I am is true. How I see myself and how
others see me are simply versions of that truth.


This book has been the dusty ground of a battle engagement
between myself and old habits, old falsifications, to which I was
so accustomed that I never questioned their truth. Now I question
every word I write.


My first attempt at suicide had taken place when I was
almost twenty. Its ludicrous failure had crystallised for me two
strands in my nature that he so close that I cannot drive a
wedge between them--my clownish sense of humour and my
melancholy. The one perpetually redresses the other, and so I
had contrived to live, uneasily jolted from one side to the

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00011&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But as I lived through my forties, I could see that to laugh
at myself was not enough. I wanted something more positive,
a fulfilment of my nature in living as well as in creativity, if
I was to continue. I thought at last that I had found it in both.
When I discovered that I had lost my love and not achieved
the recognition of my peers which I so deeply desired, it being
near my fiftieth birthday, I thought it appropriate to bring
matters to an end.


I can say nothing about my brief acquaintance with death,
for though I must have been very close to his doorway and am
a true <i>revenant</i>, I have brought back nothing. Nothing was all
there was to see. I believe death to be total oblivion, and if I
am wrong, then I think I cannot have ventured far enough to
know otherwise. My concern is now entirely with life and how
to live it. Quite fortuitously I have been given an opportunity
of assessing my life from the fairly unusual angle of
having nearly lost it.


My father had a small, fat, brown, leather-covered book, the
like of which I have never seen since. He kept it in the car.
The top half of each page showed a road map of a particular
route, say from Taunton to Bideford. The bottom half of
each page was a projection from the contour lines, showing in
coloured section the hills one would have to negotiate en route.
This little book fascinated me. I used to sit beside my father in
our old Ford, following the route meticulously, and noting
with extreme pleasure the way in which the overheated engine
conquered those daunting hills with their dark-brown crests,

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This is what my suicide has done for me. It has put into my
hands a little book of contour maps. Different routes are given
on its pages: of love; of friendship; of work; of my sensuous
life; of my intellectual pleasures. There they lie: the long
uneventful roads over the plains, the aspiring climbs, the rare
and marvellous snow-clad heights; the descents often so precipitous,
so unexpected. I take these sections between life and
death and plot their contours, as I look back over my life.


The phrase ‘look back over my life’ suggests a far-ranging
inward eye and a nice professional detachment, as of a surveyor
with a theodolite. But the writing of this book has far
more resembled a painful climb over peculiarly taxing and unagreeable
country. I am involved with what I am writing. I
am not looking dispassionately at the contours of my past.
My feet are at this moment slipping on the scree, my hands feel
the razor edge of the rock.


Here, then, in this perilous and hairsbreadth present, let me
give an account of the near death that hangs like a broken rope
beneath me. I will try to describe it in straightforward terms,
for it is interesting to know <i>how</i> a thing happens.


What is the act of suicide like, stripped of emotional overtones,
shorn of heroics, of stoic grandeur or defiance? What is
it you do and just how do you do it? With what are your last
thoughts occupied? How alert are your feelings? How sensitive
your nerves?


It was Easter and I was alone from Maundy Thursday onwards.
I had planned to take my life during the next few days.
The decision itself had been taken during the previous autumn.
I had lived with it for over six months. It was entirely
familiar and caused me no fear, though it had cost me much in

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wish to be honest, and I know well enough that you can be
more than ‘half in love with easeful death’. The thought of it,
the planning for it, becomes a perverted pleasure, a masochistic
pleasure, if you like. Death, or at least the events leading up to
it, are the deepest self-wounds you can inflict and there is a
hideous pleasure in inflicting them, though you may not be
conscious of it at the time, since you are too conscious of
the pain. And this mental, this spiritual pain (I find myself
using the old quasi-religious words) is so all-pervasive that it
afflicts you bodily. A severe heart-ache is not an imaginary
thing. It is <i>there</i>, piercing you beneath your ribs. You find
yourself lying prone, perhaps upon the floor, in such physical
agony that at times it mercifully releases you from your mental
hell, and presumably the corrective hand of nature does this
for you. Certainly I experienced these manifestations of absolute
physical torture on many occasions during that long
winter when I lived with the decision to kill myself.


To take the decision to die, a decision which we do not
normally take for ourselves, made a severe demand on my
spirit, despite my assumptions about death&apos;s desirability. To
declare that life is purposeless or worthless only begs the question:
Is death any more meaningful? No amount of intellectualising
on the subject can mitigate the awful truth that to
die is not an easy matter. When my decision to do so was
finally taken, it was upon my will and not upon my heart or
intellect that I relied.

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The roots of suicide may lie in despair, in defiance, in revenge,
or in insanity. Looking back over that night when I
arrived at the appointed time to take my leave, I see those
roots close up in darkness, leaving above ground a kind of
arboreal will, that spread its branches throughout my frame
and supported and bore me up when I came to face the fearful
barrier.


I had laid my final plans in January. I had then booked to
go to a hotel on Easter Sunday for a week&apos;s sailing, and from
there I intended to set out in my car and do the act some
distance away. I did not wish to embarrass the hotel. Though in
some ways I was desperate, certainly desperate in the exact
sense of the word since I was totally without hope, I was
quite clear in my mind as to what I was doing.


During the first part of the Easter weekend, I made my
preparations. I burned some private papers. I tied up others
with instructions written upon them. I put my will in a prominent
place. I packed up the diaries I had kept for years and
hid them, labelling them for my literary executor. On Easter
Saturday I felt that I was so fully prepared that I might as
well bring matters to an end without further delay.


For many years I had had a bottle of Luminal, secured
through a friend at the beginning of the war as a protection in
case Hider was victorious. I was an ardent socialist and had
no taste for heroism under torture or imprisonment and no
faith in my ability to stand up to either with fortitude. The
small brown bottle still had its lump of cotton wool in the
neck. I pulled it out and counted the pills. There were about
seventy. They were, of course, over twenty years old. I did not
really know how effective they were or of what strength. I returned
them to the bottle and screwed on the cap, some
vestige of consideration warning me that I was still in my own
home, where I might be found, an unsightly corpse, by one of
my dearest friends. To wait till I had left London required
almost more strength of mind than to die.


That Saturday afternoon, the loneliness of the house became

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went home at midnight. I do not remember that I slept
badly.


On Easter Sunday, I set off by car for my hotel, which was
in a small seaside resort where I had never stayed before. The
weather was brilliantly fine and warm. It was pleasant there,
and I spent Monday and Tuesday sailing all day. On Tuesday
evening I had a moment of panic. Was I justified? I suddenly
asked myself. Perhaps the pleasures of sailing had reminded
me that life might yet hold something else for me. A foolish
illusion, since one does not live by things like sailing, blue
water and sunny skies. But the illusion was sufficient to induce
me to telephone the one person who could have given me the
desire to preserve my life.


I telephoned her from a public callbox in a near-by village.
As I really knew in my heart and had long ago accepted with
all but the irrational force of longing, everything was over, and
this idiotic and painful phone call was only a trick perpetrated
upon myself, a kind of play-acting, a panic-stricken retreat
into unreality. When I put down the receiver, I wanted to
drive away and kill myself there and then, but I was determined
not to do it in these circumstances.


I went back to the hotel and ate a very good dinner. I
strolled on the quay, alone in the evening light, and found it
all inexpressibly beautiful. The extreme pain I felt prevented

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Late that evening I wrote a letter to an acquaintance. He
was a calm, level-headed person who could be relied upon, I
felt, to give the necessary information to the right parties, and
he would suffer the minimum of shock since he did not know
me personally. I gave him the addresses of those he should
inform, and told him where my body was to be found. He was
a solicitor and I knew only his home address. I realised that he
would almost certainly leave for his office before the post
arrived, but this was all to the good as far as I was concerned.
I worked it out that if I posted the letter late on the Wednesday
night, it could not possibly reach him before Friday morning,
and he might well not open it until Friday evening when he
came home. My plans went wrong. He received it first thing
on Thursday, the following morning, and read it before going
to his office.


On Wednesday evening, I had a drink in the bar and
bought some biscuits and bananas. I did not intend to have
dinner. I had spent the day sailing again, in miraculously fine
weather. I was brown and extremely fit. Really, I do not know
that I ever felt so full of well-being, physically, as on the day
when I ended my life.


I drove away from my harbour town, leaving the coast to
wind up a long river valley. The damp meadows were brilliant
with coltsfoot and kingcups, and the hills that rose to either
side were clothed in brown woods, powdered with the light,
aspiring green of spring. Every now and again, the river drove
a sinewy bend close to the road, and a smell of washed stones
and cool reeds and wet earthy banks filled the air. Willows
fringed the water in a soft haze of brilliant red.


At last I left the valley and entered the chalk country, a
colder, bleaker, bonier land, with fewer trees and hedges and
an air of only having very lately woken from winter. Here
there were many long, green tracks that travelled for miles

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Before I reached the hills, I stopped and ate the biscuits and
the two bananas. I sealed up the letter to the solicitor and
stamped it, and when I was about four miles from my destination,
I posted it in a small country town post office. It was just
after nine o&apos;clock in the evening. The last collection of post, I
noted, was at six-thirty p.m. Out of curiosity, I checked it later
in the year, and I found that I had not been mistaken. Yet I
was told, shortly after my attempt, that the envelope was
clearly post-marked ‘9.30 p.m.’. There must have been a late
collection not specified on the posting-box. How often have I
complained that letters take two or more days to reach a
correspondent. I never thought I should live to complain that
the Post Office had been too diligent.


The business of the letter and my subsequent rescue was
shot through with a positively Hardyesque irony. Fate plays
a strong hand in Hardy&apos;s novels: the letter that Tess pushed
under Angel&apos;s door, for instance, and that never reached him
because it slipped under the carpet; Eustacia&apos;s closed door and
its consequences for Mrs. Yeobright and Clym; Fanny Robin&apos;s
confusion over All Saints&apos; Church and All Souls&apos;, which released
Sergeant Troy from marrying her and left him free to
ruin Bathsheba&apos;s life. Something in me which is not reason
responds instantly to the conception of Fate which runs
through Hardy&apos;s prose and poetry, the literature which has
influenced me probably more than any other. ‘The President
of the Immortals had finished his sport with Tess’--I have
never forgotten that phrase which I must have read for the
first time when I was about twelve, and devoured the novel,
weeping copiously over its pages in the hot-scented pinewood
at the end of our Surrey garden. I posted my Hardyesque
letter, and returned to the car, committed. It was now fairly
dark and I needed my headlights. I drove up a long avenue of

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I tramped for about a mile along the track. Perhaps I was
not so much thinking as overwhelmed with sensations. My
plans were laid. I had no further decisions to take. No more
decisions in my life. Only the act to perform. My mind was a
sensitive plate, across which memory lightly traced, felt rather
than consciously remembered, the names of some of those
places I had known and loved, which had led me in the end to
this lonely moonlit down. Love is strongly localised in my
memories. The fields of Coleshill where the tawny owl came
sweeping over the stubble punctually at seven o&apos;clock every
evening, flying so low that we could almost touch it as we sat
eating our supper in the last of the sunlight. St. Nicholas&apos;s
pond with its grey willows alight with the flash of a kingfisher&apos;s
wings; Mendip and the lonely amphitheatre at Charterhouses
from which we looked out over the empty hills; Anmer with
its nightingales that sang all the night through; the murmurous
brown stream across Bodmin Moor, and the hot cornfields of
the Ouse near Huntingdon. Whether I thought of them all
consciously makes no difference. They were as much a part of
me as my flesh and blood, and I carried them with me along
the track and back again to the car. I wanted life, I thought,
as I stood there gazing out over the utterly familiar and beautiful
scene; I wanted life, but on terms that I could not dictate.
Death seemed the better bargain.


I took a small number of letters which I had kept till the last
moment and burned them in the grass by a birch tree. They
were a statement of love that no longer had any validity. It
was quite dark now, except for the moon shifting slowly across

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The details of how I killed myself, indeed the very fact that I
had made such an attempt, were lost when I first regained
consciousness. I did not know why I was in hospital and my
first reaction, my first words, were a protest against those who
had put me into one of these institutions which I hate and fear
more than anything else except prison. I could not understand
why I was so helpless, why I was unable to speak properly, or
feed myself. I was desperately lonely, unable to communicate
with the patients on either side of me, or even with the nurses.
I lay in a state of hopeless misery, longing for friends or relatives
to visit me, for some face which I could recognise, for I seemed
to have drifted into an utterly strange and hostile world. The
friends and relations were most faithful and visited me as much
as they could, but they did not tell me the truth. In this state of
puzzled, unhappy, half-consciousness, I spent the first twenty-four
hours of what was a new life into which I had been summoned,
like an infant being slapped into life at birth, by the
persistent, drumming voice of the doctor, trying to make me
regain consciousness: ‘Speak to me. You are to speak to

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My fifth night in hospital came. Visitors had gone. The day
nurses had gone off duty. I was thankful to see them go. I lay
there wondering at the way in which my friends had deceived
and betrayed me (as I thought), putting me into a public ward,
which I had always sworn I would not enter. My blood
thickened with a suppurating hatred. At last, quite late that
night, unable to sleep, and slowly walking, it seemed, down an
endless tunnel into darkness, I suddenly recalled what I had
done and why I had done it. I was overwhelmed with the
bitterest grief. Almost too weak to cry, I lay <i>in extremis</i>, and
something in my distorted face or my blurred eyes, brought the
coloured night-nurse to my side. I could not tell her what the
cause of my misery was. I could not explain to her that my
tears, which flowed at last at the sound of human speech, were
not for any event or person or emotion; that they were those
<i>lacrimae rerum</i> which cannot be translated into words. There
was little she could do for me but I cannot forget her
humanity, her quiet unquestioning presence. She approached
my bed several times during that night and made the loneliness
of finding myself alive a little less terrible to me. In the
early hours she sat for a moment on my bed and took my hand.


‘Nothing is so bad,’ she said.


‘Yes, yes, it is,’ I countered.


‘No, nothing is so bad,’ she persisted. ‘One gets over it. It
gets smaller. Life gets bigger.’


‘Not for me,’ I answered thickly.


I think the revelation that I had failed to kill myself, and that
I was back where I started, was more frightful than any other
experience I have ever had. The moment of truth is the
moment before death, in the accepted view. For me, and perhaps
for others who have seriously attempted suicide and
failed, it lies in the moment before life, a unique moment. When
we are born, infancy is a bandage over our eyes. We grow into
life. It steals upon us unawares and the bandage is removed in

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was in hospital for another three days. My splendid
physique played a major part in my recovery and exerted itself,
without consulting me, on the side of the doctors. I felt myself
in a state of siege, and betrayed within the very citadel by my
treacherous constitution. None the less, in the ruins there
skulked an underground movement. Almost desperate for lack
of arms, it still had courage and cunning. As soon as I was
out of that hateful hospital and in a nursing home, I was prescribed
sleeping pills, and night after night, I lay awake in
the direst unhappiness, in order to save a few of these precious
pills for my next attempt.


Slowly the details of that Easter weekend came back to me,
but I could not have put them down in my diary if I had tried.
I repeated them to a friend, Helen, who came to see me. Her
curiosity about the technicalities of the affair could have
seemed ghoulish, but in fact I was deeply grateful for it. It
sparked off something which has never deserted me for long,
my sense of humour.


In telling over the tale of that sombre evening on the hills,
the homely details of the food I had eaten, and the grotesque
business of the letter, I was struck by the irony of it all. And
to view the matter with irony, even with humour, was a protection
and concealed my despair, at times even from myself.
When, at last, my hand was strong enough to write, I set down
the account fresh from my telling of it to Helen, but I found
that I was quite unable to make any personal comment. The
half-jocular terms in which I had described it--as though I
had been relating some unfortunate adventure like falling into
a duckpond--were not possible in my diary, where I was face
to face with myself. Calmly, dispassionately, I wrote down a

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Here is what I wrote in my diary as I was travelling down to
the seaside resort. I had paused to have a picnic lunch, and
after eating it had taken up my diary.


I have reached a crisis in my life. I am fifty. I can no
longer be <i>laissez-faire</i>. I have to do something with my
life--end it or make something of it. I wish I could end
it in the noble Stoic fashion. At least I will not end it
on impulse. I have been re-reading the extracts I made
from Rilke&apos;s poems years ago, and with enormous interest.
I have brought them down with me, to read them
here.


Although my suicide was planned for only a few days ahead
of me, I could also plan my reading matter, and anticipate
re-reading Rilke&apos;s poetry with pleasure.


This was the last entry for nearly two months. When I
started to write in the diary again it was mid June, and the
hospital and the nursing-home were behind me.


I began to keep diaries in 1943, when, oddly enough, I was
also in hospital for a short time, a Catholic institution where I
was surrounded by bleeding hearts and other symbols of a
faith meaningless to me. In my crowded life, it was almost the
first relaxed moment that I had had. I discovered that I
wanted to take stock of myself, and perhaps it was time that I
did so. I had sworn since I was about fifteen that I would be
famous by the time I was thirty. Now I was past that age. I
was not famous, nor had I done anything that I myself considered

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Artists tend to personify the Muse. Kokoschka and the
‘Sunday painter’ Rousseau, both seem to have seen her as a
matronly, lank-haired and rather unattractive dreadnought;
Sidney&apos;s Muse (perhaps a similar type) roundly called him a
fool; Donne&apos;s, according to Coleridge (who knew a good deal
about the springs of inspiration) trotted upon a dromedary;
Horace was compelled to ask his wayward sprite: <i>Quo tendis</i>?;
Thomas Mann thought she came from the devil, ‘the giver of
all rapture’; Virgil, as befits so noble and pious a poet, found
his muse always ready to his call and was convinced that she
came <i>ab love</i>. He was, of course, writing for an imperial
patron. I cannot believe that the poet who coined the phrase
<i>sunt lacrimae rerum</i> did not have his own private <i>descensus
Averno</i>.


I think that it was in the September of 1943 that (perhaps
under the influence of an anaesthetic) I first became aware of
the plangent voice of my own Muse. She reminded me
sharply that I was over thirty. I had been writing ever since
I could hold a pen--poetry, plays, music, essays. I had published
nothing except a sonnet (on suicide) for which I was
paid two guineas by an eminent weekly paper. Apart from
this, I had not <i>tried</i> to publish anything. I was not satisfied
with what I wrote and I think I realised that I had not yet
found my <i>métier</i>.


My facetiousness about the Muse is a protection, not
against her, but against you. Riddles, jokes, blasphemy,
scatology, artists use them all as a palisade around what is
sacred, so that in the din of your laughter you will not hear
the secret voice that speaks to us; so that your idle mocking
eyes will not perceive the truth that arrogant poets keep
hidden; so that your conventional, authoritarian minds will
not meddle with what is irrational, subversive, anarchic.


<i>What my heart knows I will not say</i>,

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>I was in the Firmament<br />
With Mary Magdalen;<br />
I obtained my inspiration<br />
From the cauldron of Caridwen</i>,


sang the riddling Taliesin.


How, in what guise, we see the Muse is our business. What
we say under her inspiration is yours if you will have it. Yet
the phrase ‘under her inspiration’ is not quite what is meant
conventionally. It is to the goddess herself that we address ourselves
perpetually. You are the witnesses, and more than witnesses.
You are the partakers if you will approach the rails. The
mass is older than Christianity.


Back in 1943, lying in that private room among the
Catholic images, I think that whatever force it is that we
personify when we speak of the Muse, emerged from the
silence of my inner catacombs, and like the Sibyl in smoky
Cumae, uttered words, the meaning of which she did not know
herself:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Cumaea Sibylla<br />
Horrendus canit ambages atroque remugit</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>


<i>Cumaea Sibylla<br />
Horrendus canit ambages atroque remugit</i>.


In this case, her ambiguous and oracular command seems to
have meant: Keep a diary.


At first, it consisted entirely of quotations from books I was
reading. But soon it became a necessity to me to keep journals.
They are more accurately ‘workbooks’. I am like the old historian
Nennius: ‘I make a heap of all I can find’. Every idea
I have is volatile, is liable to escape me altogether if I do not
capture it on a page. Once there, it becomes part of my
memory, as though the diary were an extension of my mind.


Now I am writing this book, I remember Nennius again,

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

John Cowper Powys begins his autobiography with an
account of the thickness of his father&apos;s boot-soles. If I had not
started this book with an account of my death, what would I
have picked out of the heap first? Perhaps I should have
chosen my father&apos;s bow-ties.


These bow-ties always seemed to me to mark him off from
other men. The ties were themselves different from the few I
have encountered since. They were generous, plump bow-ties,
loosely knotted and winged like gulls. The collar which they
adorned was in my recollection not very high--an absolutely
straight band of starched linen, the front edges of which were
not turned sharply back but curved gently outwards beneath
my father&apos;s double chin, suiting their contours to the contours
of his ample neck. The ties were always black or grey, and
spotted or otherwise decorated with small mullets or roundels
or other devices. They were gay despite their sombre colouring,
and set off the redness of my father&apos;s cheeks. How I loved
them. The only thing that could vie with them in my sartorial
regard were his spats, grey or fawn in colour and fitting snugly
over shapely, well-polished shoes. My father had a little of
the dandy in him and exploited it.


Powys writes: ‘The greatness of my father as a personality
was first manifested to me not as a priest, not even as a trimmer

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was born in a small seaside town, a town full of the
smell of breweries and the heart-warming stink of a harbour
backwater. It was a town typical of many in Britain, and I find
myself at home in almost any small port, where those scents of
sea-water and hops, slimy mudbanks at low water, and warm,
yeasty outbreathings from brewery chimneys, are carried on
the breeze to my nostrils; where the clank of an anchor chain,
or the bell of a harbour train breaks the stillness of the early
morning, and feet in sandshoes thud over empty decks.


The first photograph of myself which I possess shows me at
one year old, an age when the features have formed some kind
of individuality, and are no longer embedded in plump babyhood.
I am standing by a table, my hands firmly grasping its
top. My legs are substantial and almost seem to grow from the
ground. My hands are palms downwards, fingers arched a
little, as though I were about to launch into a Beethoven
sonata. The face <i>affronté</i>, as they say in heraldry, and extremely
genial. My smile is bland and self-confident, my eyes

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The white desert in which I stood for my photograph was a
wholly unnatural background for a child, to whom things are
so important. No wonder I am grasping the table so lovingly.
There, at least, was one object that my infant hands recognised.
Do all children remember things rather than persons?
Good solid tables and chairs and houses are more comprehensible
than people. When I think back to my early childhood it
is almost entirely places and objects that I recall. I cannot remember
what Mary was like, the kindly Nanny who looked
after me from the age of about three to five, or Bridget, the
companion-help who lived with us when I was a little older.
They are nothing but names. But I remember with extraordinary
vividness the calefactor in the basement kitchen of

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The calefactor--and I think it was the word as much as the
object that fascinated me--the calefactor and my father&apos;s
aerial railway are two of the most vivid memories of my first
ten years. They belong to my childhood and to nothing else.
Other things, more potent and perhaps more influential and
lasting, have grown with me and belong as much to my adult
life as to my infancy. Paramount is the influence of place. Few
memories of the town remain which can certainly reflect the
sensations I experienced as a child and a child only. All have
been overlaid with later knowledge, yet some reach back into
the inarticulate past when I went for my afternoon walks,
clasping the hand of Mary or Bridget. The latter I once saw
undressing, and although I cannot remember anything of her
features or her voice or her character, I can remember the
shock I experienced at seeing the cocoon of undergarments,
petticoats, knickers, corsets, being unwound, and the oddshaped
female figure emerging--an ugly grub to my childish
eyes.


But built into my mind and into my senses are the backstreets
behind our house on the front. Fierce sea-winds funneled
down them from the esplanade, to blow dirty rags of
paper into the backwater, in those days a brown, stinking expanse
of greasy water. The gardens with the bandstand are a
confused memory of boys in blue, the wounded of the first war,
and the acrid smell of the hot, spidery, ivy-hung rustic shelters.


I have no gratitude to my parents, nor to my education, nor
to those who loved me when I was a child. My enduring love
and gratitude goes to the objects, the places, the scents and
sounds which nourished me so surely. The pleasures of books
and music, of conversation and friendship, all these are important
and I would not belittle them, and shall try to do
them justice in this book. But most of them seem to me more

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

These memories, rooted though most of them must be in the
lost world of childhood, have grown up with me, for though
I left the harbour town when I was only ten, I have often
returned, never to see people, for I know no one there, but to
walk the familiar places, to assimilate them, to <i>acquire</i> them,
deliberately, as a part of my adult life.


I have rediscovered in my grown-up self the scents and
sounds of the harbour, the pleasure of resting my long-sighted
eyes as my father must have loved to do, on a distant and satisfying
contour of green-crested cliffs. I have taken possession
again of the backstreets, sweet-smelling where the breweries lie;
of the warehouses and chandlers&apos; shops with their bins of corn
and toppings. But it has not availed me, this loving knowledge
of places. In the last resort, I cannot turn to them. They will
not save me.


Shortly before my Easter sailing holiday, I turned to my old
diaries and re-read a few random passages. I was filled with

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Like war records, journals have that morbid yet thrilling
fascination that belongs to the wider and more impersonal field
of history. Like Desdemona, we love to hear
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Of moving accidents by flood and field,<br />
Of hairbreadth scapes,<br />
Of being taken by the insolent foe<br />
And sold to slavery, of my redemption hence</i> ...
</p>
</blockquote>


<i>Of moving accidents by flood and field,<br />
Of hairbreadth scapes,<br />
Of being taken by the insolent foe<br />
And sold to slavery, of my redemption hence</i> ...


Yes, it is the <i>struggle</i> we love to watch with bated breath,
that we live over in our hearts and minds and indeed in our
flesh, as the skin creeps and the hair rises on our skulls. It is the
battle we watch that calls forth the long-drawn sigh for defeat;
the involuntary cheer for a quick recovery; that can raise a
blush of shame for cowardice, and a quickening of the blood&apos;s
pulse for an act of courage. If we were not so deeply involved
in this inner warfare of which our physical battles are a
bloody mimicry, we should never read autobiographies, letters,
diaries.


Other elements enter into it, of course: mere sneaking
curiosity, perhaps, or the superiority of Lucretius&apos; philosopher
who thought it sweet to stand upon the shore and watch
the struggles of another--but who cares for the cold detachment
of Lucretian ethics in the face of such a mellifluous
line as:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
I can, in any case, forgive Lucretius anything for the bite of his
scepticism. And now he has interrupted my thoughts and my
syntax, and I must catch up the thread again.


<i>Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis?</i>


I must write, even if it is only in a diary. The need to

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was a time when I thought this was very important,
not only to myself but to others. Now I do not think so. It falls
into place as one of those aspects of myself which has affected
me, of course, but affected me no more and no less than, say,
my reading. If I had proclaimed with as bold and belligerent
an air: I am a devotee of Hardy&apos;s poetry, of Dowland&apos;s lute
songs; their awareness of the dark side of life has influenced
my attitude to the world around me--readers would have been
puzzled at so categorical and challenging a statement, and been
hard put to it to perceive where the challenge lay. They might
have wondered at the relevance and smiled at the emphasis I
placed upon it, yet I am probably far more unusual in being a
devotee of Thomas Hardy&apos;s poetry and Dowland&apos;s songs than
I am in being a homosexual. Homosexuals are one in twenty.
Comparatively common. Does one in twenty people read
Hardy or sing Dowland&apos;s songs? Not one in two hundred, or
two thousand, or even two hundred thousand.

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This statement about my sexual proclivities must be taken
for what it is worth, no more. It explains why some of those I
have loved belong to the same sex as myself. But I cannot
describe my life&apos;s progress merely in terms of my homosexuality.
It is not this that has made my life difficult. <i>Any</i> irregularity in
one&apos;s life, sexual or otherwise, creates difficulties in a conformist
society, and I think that there are factors in my nature--some
of them, paradoxically, my best characteristics and talents--
which have prevented me from obtaining what most people
understand by happiness. There is no doubt in my mind that
those who batten down beneath hatches their inner selves, their
responsiveness, even their talents, reduce their capacity to
feel joy, as much or more than they avoid pain. If one is to
experience joy on a deep level, one must go armed against
other forces that may be encountered within oneself. My own
inability to restrain the destructive element within me has
allowed the enemy again and again to hammer at the gates.
I have not only capitulated to this force, I have actually wooed
it at times. There is something of the Quisling in my personality,
evidently. And this is where the true perversion lies, rather
than in the sphere of my sexual tastes.


Re-reading my diaries, I see their similarity to that little
brown contour book of my father&apos;s. From them I can plot, with
fair accuracy, the years of sterility in love but considerable
creative productivity; the long, featureless plains, the sudden
peaks, the steep descents, the painful climbs--all emerge
as I read. Perhaps what gives me more surprise than the
evasions and silences about my love affairs is to find from
what an assortment of bric-a-brac my creative work comes
into being.


If I were to try to describe myself as I was in the most
fruitful, lonely and private time in my life, I would, I think
inevitably, distort the picture. So, from the diaries themselves,
I take a rapid backward glance over my forties, a coda to this
first movement.

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>August 1st 1951</i>


There are going to be some changes made today.


(<i>W. H. Auden</i>)


I have spent a lifetime putting up with things I do not like.
I am not going to do so any longer. It might--in fact, I
think it <i>has</i>--become a vice in me. It is allied to my desire
to make others do things that they do not like for their
own good. There is a puritanical streak in me that dates
from my school days when I was trained to accept discomfort
and bad food. Now I will leave what I don&apos;t like
on the side of my plate and enjoy myself.


<i>December 2nd 1951</i>


It is very early in the morning, not seven, still dark but
with some colour in the sky. I have been lying awake for
a long time unhappy because I am acutely aware of my
isolation. I went to supper with J.H. recently and thinking
about this brought home strongly my isolation, for she
contrasts so markedly with the other friends that I have.
It was good to talk easily about books and plays to someone
who has an alert, sensitive mind. The trouble is that
whereas my need for friends of this kind is acute, hers
is not. She has plenty, or so I would imagine. I think
too that she has her own inhibitions, that she fears her
emotions. If I were openly to claim her friendship, she
would fear some emotional demand would be made on
her, which is not the case, for though I could say, I believe,
that I love her, I should not wish for any exclusive
intimacy, and I am not in the least ‘in love’ with her.
Above, all, I relish her conversation, which is light, witty,
yet never shallow--the light playing over deep waters.
It is one of the greatest pleasures in my life and I see her
so seldom that I feel myself severely deprived in not
obtaining more of it.

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

J.H. is one of the very few friends I made in my years at
the University. Now that she is dead from cancer of the spine,
I would like to recall her in words if I can, however briefly.
She was a friend who belonged to a different orbit from my
own. Our meetings were tangential. Hardly any of my friends
knew her, and I rarely met hers. Our interests were in many
respects dissimilar, mine in music and in the country where
I could indulge my passion for long walks (she could not walk
much owing to a slight clubfoot), hers in travel--she was one
of the most travelled people I have ever known--in people,
who fascinated her endlessly, and in mystic religion, the
ground to which she withdrew when she required strength to
face realities she saw all too clearly: her lack of sexual love,
her impending death.


Our common ground lay in the pleasure we took in each
other&apos;s interests. I hope I was as good a listener, as good a
communicator, and as responsive as she was. J.H. was endlessly
enquiring and delighted by what she discovered about people
and their various worlds. Her personal life she seldom touched
upon, not considering it of any relevance except to herself, and
more concerned with the discovery of life outside her own, and
the enjoyment and appreciation of it. In this, we were at
opposite poles, but as far as she was concerned, my capacity
for talking about myself was an advantage and a bounty to
her curiosity. It was typical of her reticence about herself that
she never told me of her first cancer operation until long after
it was over, and this was not because, like some victims of the
disease, she was ashamed or frightened of it. It did not seem to
her of importance in comparison with her fight to preserve her
love of life and exploit all it offered while it lasted. I took her to
the theatre when she was in an advanced stage of the disease,
wearing a brace and in considerable pain. She could not walk
easily nor stand for more than a few minutes. I had to leave
her in the foyer while I went and fetched the car, and never
has the walk from the Aldwych to Lincoln&apos;s Inn Fields seemed
longer. She commented good-humouredly on the failure of

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I only saw her once again, for a few minutes, when she was
lying in bed very ill, and knew that she had only a few days to
live. I called again at the house but she could not see me and I
never saw her again. She is a serious loss in my life. Another,
earlier loss is mentioned at the end of the next excerpt from
my diary. More will be said of Evelyn later, and of the part
she played in my life. The only justification for introducing her
name at this point is that the loss of her love overshadowed
such a long period of my life.


<i>December 30th 1951</i>


Staying near Hindhead with friends. I drove out and
walked for a time by myself round the edge of a fine hill,
crowned with fir trees. Pollarded alders along the bank
of the path, shooting their brown arms into the sky; green
moss as vivid and shining as pile velvet; a smell of resin;
a solitary silver birch here and there, its pallor emphasised
by the dark firs. Clear winter sunshine and evergreens
like hollies in sudden, solid masses, their colour so deep as
to be warm, almost burning in intensity. One thing was
wanting: a companion. More and more do I miss Evelyn.
It is nearly ten years since I saw her.


<i>August 2nd 1952</i>


At Hindhead. I see that almost a year ago I wrote:
There are going to be some changes made today. That has
proved true. I <i>have</i> changed. Tonight in my old familiar
room I have leaned out of the window. Above the black
trees rides an almost full moon and there are stars. A soft
rain is falling in the valley. A year ago and before that
I should have found in nature some echo of my own

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>December 31st 1953</i>


The end of an eventful year for me. Not a wholly
happy one, but generally speaking a prosperous one, which
is not at all the same thing. A year when I have become
desperately aware of my isolation, and of the closing of
my heart. I no longer want to look inward. What I seem
to have done during this year is to build a kind of floor
over my inner self, and this didn&apos;t matter as long as I
had access to it through the trap. Now I have dropped
the trap and lost or thrown away the key.


During these months I had devoted myself to my profession,
using it to blanket my thoughts. For weeks I would not touch
any creative work. Then I would pick it up again and play a
little with it. I knew that here, under my hand if I would only
use it, was the weapon I needed to cut a swathe through the
isolating undergrowth that darkened me.


In the spring of 1954, I went to stay at an old bow-fronted
hotel in the seaside town of my birth. I went there alone.
I could not return there now. The old ramshackle George,
disreputable and friendly, the haunt of sailors, and occupied
by a respectable and eccentric family, the Pascoes--this comfortable
disorder has been bought up by a brewer and is a
place of chromium and fake hunting horns and cellophaned
snacks. When I found it, in 1954, old Pascoe lived in an
indescribably filthy den behind the bar. He had lost one
arm in an accident and was now a crippled hulk, sitting
amid piles of books and papers, smoking, and drinking neat
gin, perpetually in a state of intoxication. He had known
both Thomas Hardy and William Barnes, the Dorset poet.

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My room looked out over the sea. There was a yellow
pitch-pine table in the bay window and I sat there writing a
new novel, miraculously released from months of sterility.
When I looked up, my eyes met first the gaudy crowned head
of George the Third, whose bust stood on the porch just
beneath my window. Often a seagull was perched irreverently
upon it. Then I would shift the focus to take in the vast blue
sweep of the bay.


I continued to work at the book throughout that year and
the next. It filled most of the pages in my workbooks. Only
seldom did I put down anything relative to my feelings, or
to the day-to-day life I was living. The novel absorbed my
thoughts, and was seldom from my mind even when I was
carrying out the work of my ordinary profession. But this
fertility carried its penalties. It isolated me even further and
occasionally, perhaps when I jolted to a halt in my writing, I
realised this isolation with painful clarity.


<i>July 8th 1955</i>


Inner solitude is a fact. Something incontrovertible, solid,
real. One of the few realities or certainties known to me.
One may have doubts about the existence of God, one
may even doubt one&apos;s own sanity, and one can often
enough be in doubt about the right course of action to
take or even what clothes to wear. But one thing is
absolutely certain. In the last resort you are utterly alone
and no amount of fooling yourself will alter this. Your
personal life is largely a ludicrous pursuit of love in
some form or another, bred of the delusion that love
is a uniting force, and thus, somehow, the closer you
approach another person, the more the burden of isolation

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Throughout that entry, I was writing about myself, yet I
used the impersonal ‘you’ or ‘one’ and nowhere is there an
entry which reveals the episode or the person which drove me
to write in this manner. As I neared the end of the novel, such
entries become commoner, but they are still without any of
the human data such as names and places which would recall
to me the reality behind them.

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>July 17th 1955</i>


The heat is tropical. Pigeons beat the leaves like children
with sticks. I sleep badly. A terrible sense of futility
oppresses me. My reason is everlastingly awake, criticising,
gibing, tearing me to pieces. I can&apos;t get any quiet
whatever.


<i>July 30th 1955</i>


In Cornwall. Very hot. I have slept out for two nights.
The skies are absolutely clear, the stars burn fierily; they
seem to hang very low in the sky. This morning I woke
with the early sun on my face, a perfect warmth, and a
light as though I were about to witness the birth of a new
world.


I read <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>.


<i>Why should I war without the walls of Troy<br />
That find such cruel battle here within?</i>


Time. I need time, an extension of the present time, of
my creative energy. If this Cornish holiday could be
prolonged. Last night I woke up about one o&apos;clock, to a
clear sky, after a rainy evening, a sky full of stars and with
a brilliant, deep, honey-coloured moon, just waning
from the full now and riding much higher in the heavens.
The light was golden, not a white cold moonlight, but
warm, almost radiant. The tide, just at its lowest, was
roaring as it does during these neap tides. I lay awake on
a tide of happiness, fathomless, drowned in it, conscious
of all I longed for, yet not filled with the misery of longing.


I woke and slept by turns, to see the stars lower and
lower in the sky. Hesperus vanished, the moon sank below
the hedge. I was still embraced in utter content and peace,
yet now that I recall it in the light of day, I know to have
been delusion.


<i>In sleep a king, but waking no such matter</i>.

How necessary it is for me to close my heart. These last
few months of incessant writing have drained me. I still
look for another Evelyn, for the right to expend myself,
for I know myself to be an outward-going, outward-expanding
person. I need to love more than to be loved.
So I think I must close up my heart. The fruitful season
is over. The novel is finished. Barren feelings should be
destroyed like the testament figtree. I want to have a
hospitable, social winter under a layer of superficial
contacts. I want to hibernate like an animal and consume
my true feelings painlessly while I sleep, wake to a new
year famished and lean, but unencumbered.


The new year came and the novel was published, yet early
in January, I wrote: ‘1956. It is against the grain for me to be
superstitious but I dislike the sound of 1956. I have never
cared for sixes.’


It is extraordinary to me now to read that I disliked the
sound of 1956, for it was one of the most blessed years of my
life: the year in which I was creatively productive as I have
never been before or since, and the year in which I embarked
upon my incomparably happy love affair with Elizabeth.


To re-read for the first time diaries that carry you back
into a quite different phase of your life is something of a shock.
You have forgotten what you were like, and here it is, in your
own words. My imagination was at its most fertile and I was
at one point writing three books at the same time. I see that I
was someone with an enormous capacity for joy, but having
a perpetual flirtation with sorrow and almost a love affair with
death. My capacity for enjoyment contained a morbid, self-indulgent
element which consumed, almost with relish, disappointments,
loss, pain. Yet throughout the diaries and
throughout my life there runs a vein of detachment which
enables me to laugh at myself and my masochism. As for my
encounters with death, that ‘outlandish knight upon the road’,

It was at this point in my diaries, the early part of 1956,
that I came to a stop in my re-reading. I could not bear to look
at any more. I put aside the volumes, one by one, till I came
to 1962. This one I opened at random to read an entry that
startled me by its frivolousness, for the date showed that it was
written when I had already decided to take my life, and was
indeed not many weeks from making the attempt:
<blockquote>
<p>
Death is the great cheat, the arch-deceiver. He is the
friend who can be counted on to come in the end, having
failed you on occasion after occasion, but when he comes
finally, he comes only to depart and you can have no
further converse with him. I have been on personal terms
with death nearly all my life, and enjoy his company
enormously.

This appalling passage was self-indulgent rhetoric. Empty
everything out of the bowl, and strike its shell. Windy rhetoric
is all you hear. When the bowl begins to fill again, it no longer
responds in this way when you strike it; then you can speak
and write from the store contained within it. The bowl was
drained in 1962, but I still could not resist the temptation to
hit it and make a sound, however valueless.


About three months after writing this, the frivolous light
which had played like marsh gas over the darkness of my
mind went out for good, as I thought, when I swallowed the
Luminal.


As I lay aside the diaries to write these words, the darkness has
closed in. I had a sense of it falling rapidly, and as it fell, as if
to catch the last departing light, a thrush burst into song. And
I remembered Hardy&apos;s poem, <i>The Darkling Thrush</i>.

<i>So little cause for carollings<br />
Of such ecstatic sound<br />
Was written on terrestrial things<br />
Afar or nigh around,<br />
That I could think there trembled through<br />
His happy good-night air<br />
Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew<br />
And I was unaware</i>.


Here in the warmth of a May evening, long after the sun
has left the sky, a thrush could still sing his defiant alarum
against the hosts of darkness, and a writer hear him and
wonder at the song and its confidence. A moment later, final
darkness closed over the trees. The thrush fell suddenly silent
and in that moment I was as conscious of every loss that I had
ever sustained as the companions of the Blessed Bran, when
they opened the door that looked on Cornwall and Aber
Henfelen.
