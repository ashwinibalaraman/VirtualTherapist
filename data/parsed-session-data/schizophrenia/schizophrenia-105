<b>DR:</b> So how are you doing, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I'm doing good.  I've been, uh, kind of, experimenting a little with the medicines —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because after you had given me the prescription, I, I was still tired —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> All the time.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> The only time I would be more awake is when I, uh, when it was coming time for me to have to take it again was when I was actually up.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh, one time I had completely forgotten to take it and I was up for, like, 24 hours straight, so I can understand why, if I didn't take it I'd be up for so long.  And why, I did take it, but I was always tired.  So, I started taking, you know, half as much, and it works just as fine.  I mean, I don't hear anything, nothing talks to me.  I don't have problems.  Um, I did have one problem and that's when, uh, I had gotten upset and my voices sort of, came back.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I wasn't, like, they didn't come back all the way, it was just faint talk and lots of mild stuff and —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> The, pretty much, I've been calm and —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> More focused and still doing the stuff I need to do.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's just, that I don't want to have to take as much, so I think that taking half of it —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Worked —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Pretty well.
<b>DR:</b> You'd make a good doctor.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, you think so?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you figured out, you see too much, was making you tired, and you cut it down, and the good part is, the voices haven't come back.  If they come back, then you'll have to inch it up a little bit more until you reach, you know, middle ground, where it takes care of the voices and doesn't cause tiredness.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But, yeah, you did good —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Uh, so what doses are you on now?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know, I take one Depakote and I think that's like 250 mg.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And the other one is Geodon and one of the trifluoperazine.  And I take those, all at night.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so it's one Geodon, one —
<b>PT:</b> Dep —
<b>DR:</b> Trifluoperazine
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And one Depakote, all at night.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Depakote really does its job when there's enough of it in the blood.  There's a level of between 50 and 100 or 110, then it does its job.  If it drops below that, it doesn't really do too much.  Now, the other two will still do stuff, even if the dosage is low.  So I would say if you find, the Depakote, if you can tolerate that, back at three a day would be a smart thing.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> The other two you can still leave at one.  But if you think getting the Depakote up to three won't get you tired, I mean, you know, in the past you were on the three Geodon, one Stelazine, the trifluoperazine, three Depakote, so if you, if you can keep those other two down to one a day, but get the Depakote up to three, that'll get the good out of the Depakote.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, I —
<b>DR:</b> And the other two will still do its good, even with one.
<b>PT:</b> I feel like it's the Depakote —
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> That, that's making me tired.
<b>DR:</b> Then keep it at one, but if you find yourself slipping with the voices coming back, then for sure, go up on the trifluoperazine, because that shouldn't make you tired.  Because that will take care of the voices pretty quickly.  Quicker than the Geodon, and quicker than the Depakote.  That may be one that, you might want to up that, you know.  And if it doesn't come back and you're doing good, that's good.  That's perfect, that's perfect.  How about school?
<b>PT:</b> School has been doing fine, um, I get, uh, I still have this paranoid, and I get anxiety —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Being in class with a bunch of kids.  I feel like I'm being, you know, compact and compressed —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I can't really stay focused a whole lot.  I'm, kind of, just off on my own thing.  But, I, I guess it's doing pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Do you want to up that trifluoperazine a little bit?
<b>PT:</b> You think that will help?
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  It shouldn't cause the tiredness.  And take it at night.  I'll write it for two, so that you at least have the ability to up it, depending on how, how you're doing.  Are you getting your work done, though?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm, uh, I come home and do my homework.
<b>DR:</b> And in the classroom?
<b>PT:</b> In the class it doesn't feel like I'm getting anything done.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I'm, I'm, like, studying for all this stuff, but it doesn't feel like I'm going anywhere with it.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> Like, for my tests at school, I always seem to fail my tests, but I do okay with the homework and I don't know why that is, but that's just, kind of, like, something I don't understand either.
<b>DR:</b> I think that school time is more stressful for you, that's what happens.  And it takes the mind, kind of, away from doing what it needs to do.  That's what's happening.  So paranoia has a little bit there at school, but no hallucinations?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Seeing things, hearing voices, none of that at all?
<b>PT:</b> Since I've taking, uh, the trifluoperazine —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Or whatever, I don't know how to pronounce it, but —
<b>DR:</b> Trifluoperazine, right.
<b>PT:</b> Trifluoperazine —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Is supposed to take down some of my anxiety.
<b>DR:</b> Anxiety, plus the voices, plus the paranoia, plus that, kind of, feeling that you have of feeling suffocated, that you describe.  So, it eases all of that, settles all of that down.  They all do in some way, but, uh, you know, the trifluoperazine doesn't cause the tiredness, so that may be the one to up.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And just keep it at two a day for now.  Do you need refills, do you need [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> Um, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Maybe I'll, maybe I'll give you for the trifluoperazine and the others you should have.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Because you've had, like, you know, you were on three a day, so you should have plenty of those.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, also I wanted to tell you that I also when I get upset —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I, kind of, feel very suicidal.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and that's, the thing is to control the emotions that you get.  Are you seeing the counselor here?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I see [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER].  How often is that?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I see him about once every week, most of the time.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But if, I don't know, I don't really like talking to him anymore.  I feel like, like he's just there, and just some guy that just sits there and tells me how I should be feeling and what I should be doing.  Not really of any importance, just a person.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.  But it'll be important because, you know, depending on how you are doing and how he sees you doing, if he needs to get a hold of me to adjust your meds, so that'll be good.  To make sure you share with him how you feel.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> You haven't tried to hurt yourself or thought how you'd hurt yourself or nothing like that, right?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I've thought about it, but I haven't actually tried to do anything.
<b>DR:</b> Well, doing is not an option.
<b>PT:</b> Hum.
<b>DR:</b> So, it's important, you know, to get the meds a little bit better.  They're kind of on the lower end of everything.  They're really, um, too low to really control everything.  That means, you may be more awake, but it's important to get rid of that, because if those feelings, you know, the paranoia, psychotic symptoms, the longer they stay, the harder it gets to control them.  So with that paranoia and anxiety happening, it's important to get that back under control, and probably the first thing is getting the Stelazine up a little bit and sticking with that, you know.  Okay, that's the Stelazine [PATIENT NAME].
