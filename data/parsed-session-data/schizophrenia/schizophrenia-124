<b>M</b>y twin brother Tim wrote these paragraphs the night he had
a nervous breakdown, seven years ago, our senior year at the
same college. He had stayed up all night finishing a paper on Richard
Henry Dana's novel <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i>, about a boy who goes
off to sea, and this was a sort of preface to his paper:


<b><i>"The History of Swimming"</i></b>


<i>My older brother taught me to swim when I was five years old. Edwin, who
was nicknamed "Porky" by my father, led my twin brother Kim and me to
the water one Sunday morning near Easter. He promised we would not
drown if we did what he said</i>.


<i>Porky held his arm across the water's edge and told us to fall over it until
we felt the water. I stared at the pool until my twin leapt over Porky's arm</i>

[p. <i>4</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00011&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>In adolescence, I forgot how to swim but spent a great deal of time
yearning for the water. At Boy Scout camp, I panicked when a water safety
instructor told me to run to the water's edge, strip, and save a pretend
drowning victim. I am still amazed by the speed at which the water becomes
a razor's edge</i>.


<i>With this story, I go swimming every night for a new adventure in space.
I am surprised that time and memory have taught me to swim again</i>.


I've read and reread those paragraphs countless times over the
years, but they've never seemed as foreboding as they do now. Tim
writes, <i>"With this story, I go swimming every night for a new adventure
in space,"</i> but which "story" does he mean? The novel he had just
finished reading—<i>Two Years Before the Mast?</i> The anecdote he had
just told, about being taught to swim by our older brother Porky?
Or the paper itself, the one he had written for his "Literature of the
Sea" class?


I keep thinking it's that, the actual paper, that holds the key to his
breakdown. I read it once, years ago—before I was looking for
clues—but it's disappeared since then. I doubt it even made it out of
Tim's dorm room at graduation; I can imagine him leaving it there,
hammering it into a wall like an angry edict from Martin Luther, a
warning about the dangers of thinking too much about the past to
the incoming freshman who would inherit the room and all its
secrets.


Maybe Jim Gray, the English professor for whom it was written (a
Vietnam vet who once told me the experience of war was like one
long, unrelenting rock concert), still has a copy of it. Not filed neatly
away, able to be retrieved at a moment's notice, but never completely

[p. <i>5</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i>, a boy goes to sea to find himself. It's
the basic plot of practically everything: somebody goes somewhere—
New York, Louisville, Africa, the moon, fill in the blank—and discovers,
for better or worse, wondrous, strange things about himself.
What did Tim discover about himself, reading that book? And did he
write about it, leave a map in those words, written seven years ago?
<i>"With this story, I go swimming every night for a new adventure in space. I
am surprised that time and memory have taught me to swim again"</i>. I keep
reading those sentences, but all I can see are separate words, nouns,
no verbs, themselves swimming in my mind and refusing to <i>do</i> anything:
night, adventure, space, time, memory, surprise. Little words,
big ideas. Scary things. I keep thinking I'm just on the verge of
understanding, but then the picture falls apart. The images don't
form a logical story, even though I <i>think</i> I remember the separate
images he conveys: being taught to swim by our older brother, the
humiliation of Boy Scout camp, the sadness of Easter (maybe that's
just my memory).


Who knows?


Who knows (and who the fuck cares—except me, right?) what
Tim meant in that goddamn preface. It was written ages ago, long
before either of us could have predicted what would happen in the
years to come. So <i>why</i> do those few, mysterious paragraphs keep
tumbling over and over in my head right now? Because they keep
my mind off the thing at hand? Because they're so beautifully
written? Because I think there might be hidden clues in them?


All of the above.

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My twin brother Tim is missing, really missing this time, and I
have no idea where he is. For the first time in my life, I think he
might be dead. I don't know if I can live without him, even though
I don't think I can live with him anymore, either.


The first call came around noon today. Joyce, the secretary where
Tim worked, called to see if I knew where he was, or rather, in her
not-wanting-to-scare-me-but-beginning-to-get-pissed-off way, if I
had "heard from him" this morning. He hadn't shown up, hadn't
called in, couldn't be reached. Joyce sounded like she wanted to say
more—call me paranoid, but I'm an expert at hearing things that
aren't there—but knew this wasn't the time.


I tried to stay calm and asked if this had happened before.


She said nothing, and in that silence, I knew it had.


I'd been expecting a call like this; I'd known something was going
to happen, sooner rather than later. Tim was following a familiar
pattern: any time he had to face a major change—and he was supposed
to move to a new apartment tomorrow, or rather, escape his
old one, with me helping him—he would disappear, usually on a
drinking binge. There would be no apology or explanation when he
resurfaced, only anger; usually directed at me, because he refused to
direct it at himself.


Things had been too strange lately. Things had been too strange
the last seven years. We had lived apart most of that time. I had
migrated from college in Texas to New York, moved in with a lover,
gone to grad school, gotten a coveted job finding scripts and books
for a semifamous TV star to turn into movies. Tim had moved to
Louisville, Kentucky, and social service, one of JFK's Volunteers in

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But on occasion, there was also long-distance love over the phone
and through the mail. We'd blithely make long, rambling phone calls
to each other in our lean and hungry postcollege years, no clue
how we'd pay for them, just certain there'd be some way once the
bill came due. It was the kind of enchantment, or luck, or blessing
that had followed us through most of our lives: things always seemed
to work out, at the very last possible moment. (It was the same way
we'd gotten through life to that point—no clue, no map, just a vague
hope we'd find a way by the time we got there—wherever "there"
was. Let it be said the Powers twins coasted through life with a certain
charm, but nothing a parent could call "real life skills.") We'd
exchange magnificent letters, more from Tim than me; his crafted
over long periods of time and written in different inks: this one from
work, that one scribbled on a bus, another from home late at night.
Letters that treated his drinking as a joke, a punch line. "I'm sitting
here in a bar, writing this letter. No, don't worry, it's 8 A.M., but I've
only had a few drinks."


But the drinking, or the cursed childhood, or the absence of a
map took control, and things in Louisville became more difficult for
him, until everything "crashed and burned," his frequent description
of things. He moved to New York, where I had already lived for several
years, and we didn't have the soften-the-blow cushion of long
distance anymore. Things got worse for him. He started losing small
things: phone numbers, keys, Citibank cards. Then bigger things:
jobs, apartments, boyfriends. Finally, he attempted suicide. I had

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

End of the line, indeed.


But none of it was worse than this: no phone call at all, his complete
disappearance. Even with his suicide attempt a month or so
ago, when he tried to hack off his hand, there was something to do,
an action to take: sew him back together. After his breakdown in college,
he used to say he'd let it happen so he'd have the luxury of
being put back together again, like Humpty Dumpty. But now, what
if there was nothing left to put back together?


With that one phone call from Joyce in his office, all the panic I'd
stored up over the last seven years came flooding over. "Maybe he's
just not picking up for me. Why don't <i>you</i> try calling him?" she
sneered, then hung up.


Well, fuck you, too.


And my little brother.


My little brother by all of five minutes.


There were a dozen useful things I could have done just then, but
my brain had stopped—one phone call and bam, it just froze—and
all I could think about was the little orange pumpkin on my desk.


I had brought it back from the country the weekend before, the first
bit of decoration in my new office at a new job. I had brought back
miniature pumpkins for the whole staff of four. For a while, they
were the only bit of color in the plain white rooms we had just
moved into, where I worked the phones and did lunches, begging
agents to let me see their "female-driven" projects first, before

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had bought the pumpkins at the last minute, as my boyfriend Jess
and I headed back to our apartment in Brooklyn after a weekend
trip to Connecticut. The little pumpkins weren't even officially from
New England; I got them at a roadside stand just before the New
York turnpike, set up for weary travelers who, stuck in Sunday return
traffic like ourselves, had put off buying their rustic mementos until
it was almost too late. I thought Tim, who had been staying at our
apartment that weekend, would like some farm-grown apples or
fresh-pressed cider—he was Mr. Fruit and Vegetables, always had
been, since childhood; I was Mr. Cookies and Cakes—and I got
those for him too, as well as a pumpkin to carve for Halloween,
never thinking a sharp knife was the last thing I should be putting
in his hands.


But by the time we got back to our apartment, our weekend getaway
euphoria was gone; we were tired and cranky from the drive,
the traffic and exhaust of New York. The same dread I used to get
every Sunday night about going back to school on Monday was
gripping my gut, but now, it had transformed itself into the dread of
the happy face, the high-pitched, happy voice, I'd have to put on for
Tim. The walking on eggshells. The discovery of some new calamity.
And, like time and tide, he didn't disappoint.


We got home, and the big iron gate that was the entrance to our
ground floor apartment was open and unlocked, and I knew Tim
had fucked up. The bolt was turned but hadn't caught in its slot; a

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My face clenched, I went barreling in, already yelling his name,
ready for war, even as Jess tried to pull me back. And even before
I saw Tim sprawled out on the coach, I smelled him: beer cans and
empty popper bottles, porno tapes stacked high and unwound on
the coffee table. He was still asleep, in a drunken blackout, even
though it was six or seven in the evening; his consciousness was
buried under boozy dreams and too many cum shots. But hearing
me, it took him no time at all to come alive and fly off the
couch—fully clothed, fully awake now—and know why I was so
mad. It took us no time at all to start screaming at each other, no
time at all for him to grab his things and run out of the apartment,
his final "Fuck you" ringing in my ears. That or the clang of slamming
the metal gate behind him; it was hard to tell which was
louder.


At least this time, he remembered to close it.


I chased after him, begging him to come back, at the same time I
wanted him to go away and never return.


When is a pumpkin not just a pumpkin? When you just gave it to
your twin brother, who's now running down a dirty New York street
with a hangover headache and no shoes. When your twin brother
turns around one last time, not to say he's sorry, not to beg the
heavens to explain why the twin boys who used to love each other
so much now hated each other, but to hurl the pumpkin at you,
splattering its rind and seeds all over the sidewalk.


Oh, yes, Mr. Sondheim was right: a weekend in the country.

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Fucking baby pumpkin.


I twirled it in my fingers, fingered its serrations like rosary beads,
as I tried calling Tim from my office. The message on his answering
machine was his regular one, Tim in happier times, not drunk, and I
already wondered if it would be the last record of his voice I'd ever
hear. I spoke through the machine, hoping that if he heard me, who
had seen him through the worst and still not abandoned him, no
matter how much I had felt like it, he might pick up. But there was
no answer, for me or anybody else, so I went to his office, just a few
blocks away from mine, to see if I could figure out anything more in
person.


Tim works for Frank, a director who once made important
"films," but now makes "movies." Bad ones. And even those he had
trouble financing. Tim was Frank's lackey, reading scripts and running
errands for his socialite wife. The company had just set up shop,
like my employers, but unlike ours, their walls were already covered
with posters that were a retrospective of the director's career, as if to
remind him he had once had one. Of course, Tim, not Frank, had
the job of schlepping around and getting all those posters framed.
There wasn't enough money to make movies, but there was enough
to buy big, expensive frames. (And really, was there that much difference
between me and Tim and our jobs? I had an expense
account and a business card that said "Director of Development"; he
had no card, no title, but we both schlepped home books at night
and on the weekends, to wade through for other people. Mine came
in the form of hundreds of loose pages of manuscripts that practically
dislocated my shoulder with their weight. Tim bought his off
bookstore shelves, already published, too late to really play the game,
but we were both doing the same thing: reading, the thing we'd
taken refuge in since childhood.)

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Frank's secretary, Joyce, had always been gracious to me, intrigued
by the mystery of twinship, asking the same first-meeting questions
people always ask: Can you read each other's minds?


(We can't, not really, but in the breath he takes before he says hello
on the phone, I can hear his life.)


Do you know what the other one is thinking?


(I don't know when he feels a specific pain, but I know he's <i>in</i>
pain.)


Can you feel when he's sick? Can you "mind-read" where he is
all the time?


(I don't know when he leaves his house, but I know he is not
there now.)


Did you ever try to fool each other's girlfriends?


(Maybe it was the fact that we are fraternal, not identical, that
saved us from that one; more likely it was the fact that anyone could
tell we didn't have girlfriends.)


Now, all that polite curiosity was gone, and Joyce wanted to hold
me accountable for Tim. His absence had screwed up her day, and
she needed someone to blame; it might as well be me. To her, at that
moment, we were the same person, interchangeable, even though we
weren't identical.


In our looks, and certainly in our voices, there is the hint of
kinship—that gap between our two front teeth, from the Perkins
side of the family, the barest touch of a Texas accent—but Tim has
always been taller than me, maybe because he stands up straighter,
with light blond/brown hair to my darker locks. Our late grandfather
called Tim "Blondie" and me "Brunie." Tim always has a tan, no
matter what time of year; I don't like the sun that much, and have
the "pasty-white skin of the stay-at-home," the only phrase from the
Boy Scout Manual that has stayed with me all these years. I look

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Look," Joyce said. "Is this a joke?" No preamble, no "I'm sorry,"
no "I hope he's alright," no "I can't imagine what you're going
through."


"Just give me extra butter and shut the fuck up," came back to
mind, but I held my salty tongue.


She pointed to Tim's desk, piled high with papers, scripts, receipts,
old <i>New York Posts</i> and <i>Daily Newses</i>, the packs of gum the director
needed to keep from smoking, probably even a change or two of
clothes.


I didn't know if the mess was the joke Joyce meant, or something
else. She just kept staring, pointing with her head, hands on her hips
like the proverbial little teapot (I expected her to say, "Tip me over
and pour me out"). Did she want me to clean it up? Is that what all
this was about? He hadn't been hired for his neatness; surely she'd
figured that out by now. There's a picture of him in one of our college
yearbooks, sitting in his dorm room, which was overtaken by
papers, books, records, dirty clothes, and, so help me God, a vacuum
cleaner. What that was doing there—it had certainly never been
used—I never could figure out. Tim should have pasted copies of
that picture on his résumé: "Here, this is who I am: smart, but a mess.
It's a package deal. Take it or leave it."


"<i>Look</i>," she said again. Alright already, I'll clean it up. I went over
to the desk and finally saw what she meant. Excavated from the
rubble was his Day-At-A-Glance calendar. Joyce had flipped to

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He'd also written, in the pages leading up to it, that familiar phrase
that made my stomach seize up: "Crash and Burn." He'd written it
so often he even came to abbreviate it C&amp;B.;


"What's that mean? Crash and Burn? Swimming?" She shook her
teapot head again. "I don't know how much longer Frank's going to
stand for this."


I looked at the page again; there was something else about it,
something more than those foreboding words "swimming" and
"crash and burn" in all their isolation. Was it the relative blankness of
the pages earlier in the week that was so strange? Monday through
Wednesday were completely empty, unlike most of the previous
weeks, which were filled with appointments written in different
colors of ink—"red/blue/green," said very fast, the punch line to a
joke I remembered from grade school. No erasable pencil for my
brother, no sir. Thursday night, the night before this, he'd written
"Something with Peter G." around 6:45. Tonight, Friday, he was
supposed to go out with "Dan M." (No last names for my brother,
either. It's not me protecting the innocent, that's just the way he
wrote them.) On the next day's page, Saturday, he'd written "Moving
to Weehawken, NJ" with big stars around it, like the light bulbs on
a movie marquee, the same icon he had drawn in high school and
college on special letters to special friends.


I would have called those people, Peter and Dan—I knew who
they were—but it wasn't the appointments, who had last seen him
when or where or who was supposed to see him, that meant something.
It was the date, the end of October.


I closed my eyes—not easy to do under the watchful, judgmental
glare of the ever present Joyce—and tried to think. And again, all that

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And there it was.


Swimming.


I suddenly knew.


If not the exact anniversary of his breakdown, it was certainly
around the time he had left school, near one of the fall holidays, Halloween
or Thanksgiving.


When he had gone "swimming" in time and space.


In the weeks before his breakdown, that fall of our senior year, Tim
had been reading <i>Moby-Dick</i> for his "Literature of the Sea" course;
"Moby's <i>Dick</i>" we'd yell out with a cackle, across the din of the cafeteria,
then stretch our arms as far apart as they'd go, a visual of
Moby's dick that left nothing to the imagination.


That was when we <i>were</i> talking to each other. More often than
not, in those days, we weren't: we'd pass each other and stare, a challenge,
angry over some unspoken slight. Those silent looks were our
favorite weapons then, much more than words. Strange: the boys
who were so much better with words than anything else—people,
cars, emotions—couldn't use them with each other, at least at that
strange juncture in our lives.


And I couldn't figure out why we weren't talking. Tim seemed to

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Pip was Melville's servant boy who went underwater and came
back—what? Dead? Alive? An unholy, visionary mixture of both? An
almost beatific look would come into Tim's eyes whenever he talked
about Pip, which was often, as if they had both lain witness to the
same thing. Maybe Atlantis, maybe God, but whatever it was, Tim
couldn't wait to see it again. And those of us who hadn't seen it,
whatever it was, weren't worth talking to.


Tim was Pip that fall.


My last conversation with him, before his breakdown later that
night, took place by a row of bushes surrounding the campus's central
administration building. It was early evening, and I, self-important
little college actor that I was, was racing off to a rehearsal for <i>The
Faust Project</i>, our attempt to be avant-garde, when I ran into Tim.
Literally. I was playing Faust and mumbling my lines to myself, wondering
how in the world I could convince an audience I had seen
hell—later, it would be so easy—when I bumped into him. He
blurted out that he didn't have time for me, didn't have time for anything.
I said something nasty in return, and we stood there, wondering
who was going to have the last word.


That's what it always came down to in those days: who would
have the last word.


For those few, silent seconds, I remember picking at the waxy
leaves of that hedge, getting their rich green and chartreuse pulp
underneath my fingernails, as if I needed to dig my nails into something,
to keep from digging them into my own skin, or Tim's.

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Several walkways radiated out from where we stood, like spokes
from a central hub, and we could have taken any one of them to
escape each other. But for some reason, we didn't. Maybe we were
bonded, for those few minutes at least, by memories from our childhood:
the feel and smell of waxy leaves, the sight of street lamps on
timers, flickering on and off as falling nighttime teased us, then
finally took hold, in those waning days of summer; the last days of
childhood, when we would try to squeeze every last second out of
the darkness before we had to go in for the night.


Now, Tim smiled first, a little cautiously, like dipping his toes in
water to test the temperature, then began telling me about a painting
that my dorm room neighbor had been working on: a mystical,
almost otherworldly depiction of two naked bodies, neither male
nor female, their hills and valleys beckoning to the acolyte. As Tim
described it, he was overtaken by the Pip look—that inscrutable set
of his eyes and mouth, his brow and the brain behind it, that
harkened back to some wondrous, strange thing that only he had
been chosen to witness.


I was surprised by Tim's description of my neighbor David's
painting; I didn't even know they were friends. I'd taken to nightly
chats with David as study breaks (I had a little crush on him) and had
never heard him mention the painting, or even knew he painted,
because he was a bigwig in the music department. I told Tim I'd have
David show it to me. Tim half smiled as he walked away; the missing
half of the smile was a mystery I was supposed to solve.


Later that night, I was at the <i>Faust</i> rehearsal when Tim "broke
down," unreachable even if he had tried to reach me. I've always
needed to think he did. (Did his breakdown happen in a single
minute, an hour, a night, or did it take the twenty-odd years of our
lives to gather force and strike?) Ironically, after that night's rehearsal,

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Gee, thanks.


Inadvertently, I was told on the phone the next morning by one of
Tim's professors that something had happened. Dr. Hinkle assumed I
already knew; I didn't. That was the first time I've ever felt the panic
on a phone call that has been a frequent visitor these past seven years.


Tim wrote this that very first night my father brought him home:


<b><i>"Time At Home"</i></b>


<i>I stopped crying after midnight and told my father about a friend at
school</i>.


<i>"His name is Michael. If boys are pretty, then Michael is such a
pretty boy."</i>


<i>My father stared out the window of the house where I was born</i>.


<i>"Last summer, he went across the United States and spent only $30.
Can you imagine that?"</i>


<i>My father counted streetlamps from the window and reached for a cigarette
on the table</i>.


<i>"Michael met so many people on the road. They bought him dinners
and gave him places to stay."</i>


<i>My father drew the shades. He stubbed out his cigarette in a cup of
cold coffee and said, "I think, son, if I were not such a scarecrow
now, I could make the trip for $20."</i>

<i>It is no time / To make your father cry</i>.


It is no time to make your brother cry either, but that is what I was
on the verge of doing, when Joyce brought me back to the present
and said Frank wanted to talk to me.


I was intimidated by Frank's fame and always worried about whether
I sounded intelligent and witty in his company. "Company" was hardly
the word for it; presence was more appropriate. But at the same time that
I felt awkward around him, I was privately dismissive about the commercial
comedies he was now making, and angry at him for causing so
much of Tim's unhappiness. (That's right, Kim: blame everybody but
Tim. Blame everybody but yourself.) Tim felt differently about Frank's
movies each time he saw them, depending on how he felt about Frank at
the time. When Frank was nice to him, the movies, even the bad ones,
were works of genius the rest of us failed to understand. When Tim was
mad at Frank, and I had finally figured out something nice to say about
the movies,Tim thought they were a mess, and was I out of my mind?


Frank was the kind of person I deepened my voice to talk to.


The first and only thing he asked, was if Tim had cut his wrist the
month before: the scar, the roll of gauze bandage he had passed off
as covering a burn....


Frank knew.


Maybe he had tried the very same things in his life.


I told Frank the truth, even as I knew Tim would be furious at
me for doing it. And even though Frank said he was worried and

At one point—maybe the only point of real kindness in the short
conversation—Frank shook his head and said, "Oh, Kim." Nothing
more, but I understood. He had been a child like us—nervous, sensitive,
not sure of his way—and maybe he still was, even though he
couldn't let it show anymore. He knew what could make a sensitive
boy disappear, but not how to find him. That would be up to me, and
he didn't envy me the task.


He wished me good luck, and our meeting was over.


I took the calendar on Tim's desk on my way out.


Joyce saw me do it—she opened her little tea spout and started to
say something, to protest, "We paid for that, it's ours"—but the pain
and fear in my eyes silenced her for once.


Maybe the calendar would help me find my brother, wherever he
was swimming.
