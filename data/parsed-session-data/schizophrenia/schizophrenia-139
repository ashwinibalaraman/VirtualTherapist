BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Alright. So I guess the first question is, do you want me to give you monthly statements? Would that be helpful? I generally haven't, you've generally paid me. If you want these statements I can. Either way, the way this will work is that it will just reduce the cost of the session by 50 bucks.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So I can look up how many recordings we did in February, but it was probably 3 maybe?
CLIENT: That sounds right. I don't think we did the first week, but I think we started right away as soon as you started doing them
THERAPIST: Right. So yeah I think I... If you give me a minute, I can just look it up if that's... because I went through all the billing over the weekend. (pause)
Right because I remember you being short one Wednesday for the month, but on the other hand you had done the recording which you hadn't accounted for. I think you were 50 bucks ahead, actually. But let me... Yes. Yup. Minus 50, there you go. [00:02:02]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So do you want me to credit you? Do you want to have this back? It's up to you.
CLIENT: Sure. And then next week I can pay for the rest of March, whatever month this is. Yeah March.
THERAPIST: This is March. (laughter) Whatever you want.
CLIENT: Yeah okay. Because I had to like withdraw from this thing I didn't know I could withdraw, so it would actually be useful to have the money this week and then pay you for the rest of the month.
THERAPIST: Do you want it all?
CLIENT: No, no. Take this weeks and then next week...
THERAPIST: Okay. So I'll take 100 for this week, right? And then we're good for this week.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So you will have paid me... Wait a minute. You have 50 ahead, I should take... If you gave me 50 bucks, we'd be even up through today. Because you were 50 ahead on last month. I don't know that I have two 10s, but I can look, or we can just...
CLIENT: I guess you can look so we can just not have to carry over confusion to next week. (laughter) [00:03:12]
THERAPIST: Okay. I do have a 10 actually. Here.
CLIENT: Lovely.
THERAPIST: Okay. So in that case I'll also give you this one, and this one. So you just pay me 50 bucks which means that I think we're current through today because you were ahead 50 from February...
CLIENT: This is like gambling. (laughs)
THERAPIST: You were ahead 50 from February. It would cost you 100 today with the recording. So if you're going to pay me for the rest of today that would be 50 more. So now I have 60 but gave you 10. So I think we're square.
CLIENT: And then next week I should bring 300? [00:04:08]
THERAPIST: If there are three more Wednesday's .
CLIENT: Okay. I don't know whether there are. I'll look.
THERAPIST: Okay. Do you want me to look right now or...
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: We can just switch over to accounting and it's not like you'd be wanting to talk to me about that. Okay month.
CLIENT: You can teach me math lessons. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Oh gosh, I don't know. So today is the 7<sup>th</sup>. So there are, if we scratch through today then yes, there are three more Wednesday's after today. So yeah, it would be 300 for the rest of March.
CLIENT: Okay cool. Oh man. It's Jeff's birthday today so we're going out in Provincetown later. So that should be nice. I keep to like Provincetown. Not easy.
THERAPIST: It's not about your efforts, but...
CLIENT: I actually went to a general doctor's appointment in the city on Monday and found a neighborhood I liked. That was nice.
THERAPIST: What? Where's that?
CLIENT: It was some part of the south end that reminded me a little bit of (inaudible at 00:05:38). A different style of brownstones, but I liked the preponderance of brownstone and small stores, it's sort of (inaudible at 00:05:49)
And this week I've been pretty annoyed because I e-mailed the place that hired me on Monday morning like, "So where is my first assignment? It's still not showing up in the system." And they got back to me, "Oh we're definitely getting the first assignments out this week. Keep an eye out." No, "Sorry we're behind" or no, "We're guessing Thursday morning...". So every week for the last three weeks, they've said, "This week we're getting you an assignment." And like my parents are starting to get worried because they had expected I would be getting paid by right now, but this time. I don't think they would have wanted me to come back if they thought I wasn't going to be working by the beginning of March. And they were saying maybe I should start applying to other jobs, which is sort of intimidating. Because applying to jobs just sucks. And if they actually give me my assignments and let me start, it will be a waste of time. So I've decided I'm giving them until the end of the day Friday, and if they haven't assigned me something by then I'm going to apply for more jobs. Ugh. It's frustrating. [00:07:23]
Because at least if I were doing that job I would feel like, "Well at least I'm getting my own bills paid," and that would be something to feel good about. Because in the past, even if I didn't like my job, at least I was independent. And it just feels like shit not being independent, especially at this age. Not that I feel like I'm super-old, but definitely old enough that I should not be taking money from my parents. I just feel that's really lame. And I know it's, it's not just the psychology of it, I know it's hard on them because they're taking money out of savings to support, pay my rent and stuff like that. It's not like they have this extra income that they can throw my way.
THERAPIST: I see. That's really a cost for them. [00:08:17]
CLIENT: Yeah. And they're already behind on their retirement savings because of Yale. They still are $180,000 in debt from Yale. They really shouldn't have sent me there. (chuckles) Because of the living expenses and tuition.
THERAPIST: I bet your living expenses are high.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like the dorms were 1,000 a month, which is... my senior year I got wise to the fact that that was ridiculous and got an apartment, but my first three years I was living in expensive dorms. And not that I had like a single room or something. I always had one to three roommates in a very small room. So I keep hoping I'm going to do something lucrative in the next five years and help them pay off Yale. Although I don't know what I can do that's lucrative. (laughs) I don't know. (sighs) I'm still working on that one.
I've thought of trying to write a novel that would just be purely for money-making purposes and doing it under a different name, but even that is such a gamble.
THERAPIST: Teenage vampire novel or something? (laughter) [00:09:54]
CLIENT: I mean J. K. Rowling, I don't know how you say her last name, had to send Harry Potter to like 50 different publishers. And she had all these books in a storage cabinet in her closet for years, and no one was looking at them. So it's not like I could figure out the formula to the magic money-making novel and pay off my undergrad tuition with that. So I don't know. (pause)
I guess last week I was thinking about what you said at the end and I probably took it more personally that it was meant. I sort of wondered if I was being bad at therapy or something.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: And I don't think that's how you meant it.
THERAPIST: That's not how I meant it. Not at all. [00:11:04]
CLIENT: So I sort of realized I was probably being irrational.
THERAPIST: Well tell me more, what did you think?
CLIENT: I guess last week in general I was feeling sort of frustrated with sort of the amount of effort I put into trying to figure stuff out. Or what seems to me like trying. And just frustrated with how unclear this mechanism is with what everybody wants from me. And I guess just having it called into question, whether I really wanted to figure out what was going on sort of made me wonder, "Oh dear, what if all this work that I imagine I've been doing is bad or useless or inefficient, ineffective?" And it would just seem like yet another thing at which I try really hard and just tread water.
THERAPIST: And what work were you thinking of? Were you thinking of here, or were you thinking of writing stuff down, were you thinking of something else? [00:12:34]
CLIENT: Hm. Just everything. I mean... I think the journals have been a big time investment and investment as a daily part of my routine. And coming here is hard in that it's sort of hard for me to own up to say what I'm doing with on a regular basis.
THERAPIST: How so? [00:13:02]
CLIENT: I think it's easier for me to not talk about my issues with actual people. And with Jeff especially I do talk about my concerns on a daily basis. But if I don't feel like it, you know, there are plenty of other things to talk about. When it's here I feel somewhat obligated to talk about concerns and I guess sometimes it seems like it would be nice to not have to, to just let myself imagine I don't have concerns. And I guess I feel sort of an obligation to be, to at least try to be honest about the state of things every week.
THERAPIST: Oh I think you do. I think you work at this and work in general to figure things out. I guess I also imagine that you, like the rest of us, are kind of ambivalent about it in that there's one part of you or in one way you want to know and you work hard and you try to figure things out, and then there is another part probably mostly unconsciously that gets in the way. That makes it hard to think, that makes it hard to put things together, that makes you want to forget, or makes you want to think things are otherwise. I think... (pause) To my mind that's part of what therapy always involves. Like very much inherently, in one way or another, is dealing with the ways when one doesn't want to know. Yeah. [00:15:30]
CLIENT: Yeah. It's interesting to try to think about what not wanting to know actually looks like. Because I think in a sort of practical sense I very much want to know, and I'm also curious to know just from a self-knowledge perspective. But I think I'm sort of skeptical that this other forest has anything that interesting to tell me, at this point. I guess I feel like I put a lot of things together and connected things that I hadn't connected before. And identified concerns that I hadn't really realized were so serious.
THERAPIST: What are you referring to?
CLIENT: Just sort of the pattern of traumatic events and how that related to concerns about writing and language. And I think that was really enlightening. And I sort of wondered that, "Now that I made those connections, what could this thing possibly want from me?" I guess it's hard to imagine whether there is something it wants me to think about beyond those things, or whether it wants me to think about those same things more. Or whether it wants me to have it as more part of my every day consciousness. Like I guess there was a time when it seemed like it really was trying to tell me things I didn't already know, and now I'm sort of really confused as to why it's sending me mysterious symptoms here and there, and what it wants. [00:17:32]
THERAPIST: What symptoms lately?
CLIENT: Um, I mean just... My old (inaudible at 00:17:43) says like last week when I was seeing the aura and the purple light...
THERAPIST: Yeah as we were talking. I think maybe it was right around the time I said something about you probably not wanting to help.
CLIENT: Yeah. It was when you were saying that.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:18:01]
CLIENT: And that was the most intense visual disturbance that has happened in months. And after that I think maybe I saw like a little bit of weird purple light or auras one day after that, briefly but that was it. I don't know. I've just been feeling sort of twitchy and fidgety and having these recurring anxiety scenarios that are a little bit harder to get out of my life. Some days are worse than others.
THERAPIST: Like what?
CLIENT: Talking to people in my cohort or in the English department. Or just really like talking to people from my past too and trying to tell them what I'm up to. It's really unappealing. There are people who I really should e-mail, probably e-mailed me and I haven't responded because I don't want to talk about my life. [00:19:08]
THERAPIST: So I think these are all moments, including what we were seeing last week, that upset you and made you feel like you're not safe.
CLIENT: It seems like being vulnerable to people's judgment shouldn't be such a big deal. I don't know why that's as upsetting as it is. (pause)
THERAPIST: I guess that's one of the things you're telling me today is you felt last week like I was not just making an observation, but making what felt more like a judgment. [00:20:14]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And that made you feel very vulnerable?
CLIENT: I guess I felt sort of judged. And it was almost like you'd said that I was doing bad work. And when I thought about your wording, it was clear to me that that was not what you were actually saying. But it still sort of felt like that, even though... (chuckle)
THERAPIST: Sure. Sure, sure.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So you were actually right, that was not was I was saying. However, there was something about hearing it that way that made you feel very uncomfortable. Do you have any thoughts about that?
CLIENT: I felt lame for getting upset about it. I told Jeff and I was like, "I'm being totally unreasonable, right?" And he was like, "It sounds like a question to push you in a new direction. It doesn't sound like a judgment." And it just sort of made me wonder; am I looking for approval everywhere? I don't know. Or has trying to deal with these issues become such a central part of my life that a judgment on it is much more upsetting than you think it would be? I don't know. And it made me sort of think that maybe I don't have a lot going on right now, so I guess everything that I'm doing becomes much more sensitive. And I guess I do like to think that I'm trying hard to make progress. Partly justifies the journaling and gives me something to feel marginally okay about. (laughs) I don't know. (pause) [00:23:15]
THERAPIST: I do think that you're not entirely in control of how you're working on that. In my opinion, none of us are, trying to deal with these sorts of things. I don't mean, (inaudible at 00:23:58) in various ways, but I do mean there's something that I think is making you pretty helpless in some ways about this stuff.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean there's something like a highlighter or something. It's like I submitted a statement and got it back with certain parts highlighted but no comments and I didn't know whether the highlighter was saying things were good or things were bad, or true or false, or if I was supposed to explore them or avoid them. And the total lack of directionality of these symptoms. Well not total. There have been times when it has been clear what the message was, but others when it's really not.
THERAPIST: Do you mean like having a visual disturbance is ambiguous? [00:25:24 ]
CLIENT: Mm hm. (pause)
THERAPIST: Like seeing something that's horrific is in a way more pointed and clear, but a colorful visual disturbance is more ambiguous?
CLIENT: Yes. And I remember when I used to see purple when one of my two professors would talk about self-expression in the text. And notions of how characters were expressing various things. Now I don't remember exactly what the context's were, but that was clearly being highlighted but I wasn't sure to what end. Whether maybe I agreed or disagreed with what they were saying, or whether it was just that that topic was important and I should pay attention to it. Or whether I was supposed to actually do something. I don't know.
And it's obvious whenever I try to go to rhetoric class which a friend led, and would get really busy and hot and get headaches. That was a pretty clear — I got that.
THERAPIST: Right. [00:26:59]
CLIENT: But when I would try to go to campus and would get really bad headaches and would get dizzy, it was... I figured out that I was supposed to stay away from this place. But it doesn't say exactly why now. Cleary it's a very sort of stressful place that requires a lot of vulnerability in that you are expected to be expressing your opinions in class and turning in papers really early and so it's just four days a week you are exposing yourself to the criticism of others and exposing opinions that are very important to criticism. [00:28:04]
But it seems odd to keep stressing that. I don't know why I just can't get over it. (pause)
THERAPIST: I guess I imagine that being in all these, being in school makes you want to do something that at the same time terrifies you, which is to say what you think. Express yourself. Which, especially when it's on the page, but even live, makes you quite vulnerable to criticism or other things. Manipulation, seduction, a number of other things, in a way. But at the same time I think you also really want to put that stuff out there. Bring new opinions about literature, will, (inaudible at 00:30:05) here. [00:30:14]
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. I guess back when the mechanism was being more communicative, it really wanted me to either go off to a cabin in the woods and isolate myself from people, or to join some like anarchist protest movement. Both of which don't really subject you to criticism. One allows you to express your opinions by yourself, the other allows you to express them in a way that isn't so much a dialogue, it is more of a spectacle. Which sounds more vulnerable, but sort of isn't because you don't really expect to get good feedback necessarily. (laughs)
So it seems like I find myself in this middle ground that's very uncomfortable. And it's been really nice to take reading notes. I always, when I was in undergrad and grad school, regretted not making my own detailed notes about things I was reading. And I did some of it in grad school. I did it with Prist (ph) which was really nice and with the Brontes (ph). I took notes of sorts of things events and quotes, and what page they appeared on to make it really easy to go back and find those events and quotes. So that is something I've been wanting to do, and it was helpful. But since I have time to write on my own, I've been taking detailed notes every day on what I'm reading. And it's so nice not to have to show it to anyone and knowing that I'll have that to myself forever. And it's almost like, "Well this is so much nicer. Maybe I should just do this instead." Just do it for my own enjoyment, because I do enjoy it. But I know working full time doesn't give you a lot of time to enjoy that. That's the problem. (chuckle) (pause)
THERAPIST: And why not show them to somebody else?
CLIENT: Hm. I think if maybe I myself can enjoy them, I think that's enough. It is an audience. (laughs) [00:33:18]
THERAPIST: I'm not trying to be directive about what you should do. But I'm wondering about the dangers of showing it to other people, I guess, regardless of what you decide to do, those seem to me important to investigate. Which is why I'm asking.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess people are so eager to criticize and I guess the notes I'm taking don't take into account research and secondary literature, which are things I'm most interested in. I still want to keep looking into, no matter what I do in the future. But there's something nice about being free from the burden of a billion secondary texts and an audience that is somewhat hostile.
THERAPIST: What burden is that?
CLIENT: That is having to take lots of other people's opinions into consideration, while and before expressing your own. With some of the contemporary literature, there isn't that burden. I can read something that came out last year ... [00:35:08]
THERAPIST: Sure. (inaudible at 00:35:08)
CLIENT: Yeah. So that's been sort of interesting. But I just started reading Anti-Oedipus by Deleuze and Guattari. It is sort of actually an anti-psychoanalytic approach that draws a lot on Marks and Micha (ph). And I thought it would be interesting because it is sort of, I don't want to say gimmick, it's the idea of psychoanalysis which...
THERAPIST: What's that?
CLIENT: ... sort of tries to get out of neurotic patterns and applies some sort of <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>-inspired interpretative scheme to the world. And this book came highly recommended from one of my theory professors anyway who is actually really into psychoanalysis and thought this was an interesting companion and asked interesting questions. So it's a well respected book. I think the subtitle is Capitalism and <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>. And I'm having some serious problems with its appropriation of <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia2"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia3" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> as a way of looking at the world when I don't think either of these guys is schizophrenic. Because have any idea what sort of weird mental disturbances feel like. And they bring in Judge Schreiber as an example of someone who could be better integrated into their pluralistic social society. And it's like, he wasn't exactly very happy about all of these delusions he was having. It made it extremely hard for him to be part of his family. He wasn't thrilled to have these different gods dictating to him.
THERAPIST: Sure. [00:37:36]
CLIENT: So it was strange because on one level I thought maybe it would be something that, I thought it might almost for something to talk about the positives of mental illness and disturbances. Like I don't know, it made me feel sort of good and like I had an interesting perspective to add. But it ended up just making me feel kind of bad because it's like — I don't think they know. They said there is no discreet clinical entity that is <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia3"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span>. Which is, I don't know to what degree that's true or false but it takes it away from the human level of an actual problem people have.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (laughter) Sort of, how would you need two of you to thrive in.
CLIENT: And I think... It's a very thick book. Densely written and not organized as well as it could be, but I'm curious to see whether it's good and interesting enough that they can sort of get away this extremely theoretical approach to human problems. So right now it bothers me. Maybe it can be overlooked. [00:39:19]
One of the interesting things about reading the really theoretical texts about psychoanalysis, like (inaudible at 00:39:32). He saw patients but you can read a lot of his lectures and forget that he's talking to himself. I mean, you know he has a ton of works so he's probably seen the words literary or (inaudible at 00:39:51). But there's probably a lot that I haven't seen that's more informed. With Freud, I think you get a sense that there's this very human presence in everything he's thinking about. Although with Schreiber, he never saw Schreiber, he just read the book.
So I guess I was just sort of looking for something that is disturbing me instead of empowering me.
THERAPIST: Wait. I don't quite follow. [00:40:31]
CLIENT: I thought that Deleuze and Guattari would be empowering, not so much Lecan (ph). I haven't read him in a while anyway.
THERAPIST: Right. I follow the way that you thought it would be empowering and how in providing sort of a more broad, inclusive view of mental life. Like writing psychoanalysis, in a way. And I guess in particular seeking the (inaudible at 00:41:47) that has been socially invalidated from the personal experience with most mental illness. Is that more or less what you had? [00:42:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. Like especially the second. Because I have thought that, I have been forced to ask foundational questions that have led me in interesting directions. And I was sort of hoping to have that maybe affirmed and to go further in that direction. But I don't know. I haven't read enough of it to characterize it. Well I just started it a couple of days ago.
THERAPIST: What kind of foundation questions did you have in mind?
CLIENT: Mostly in relation to the prohibition against using language, and how I could be allowed to use language again. I think that pushed me into interesting directions. And when I was supposed to communicate through colors and shapes and not language, like why and whether they were really safer in any way. I mean just having some really totally irrational demands imposed upon me, and trying to figure out why. [00:43:16]
THERAPIST: Why? I read one of Freud's earliest book which, when somebody reads, is sort of precisely about that.
CLIENT: Really?
THERAPIST: Yeah. On Aphasia?
CLIENT: I haven't seen it.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I think he wrote it in like 1891, maybe? And he was trying to propose a model of aphasia that accounted for more psychological aphasias which he saw clinically. In addition to things like aphasia resulting from illness or injury, like brain, like people being physically hurt in one way or another. Yeah.
CLIENT: Hm. I should check that out. [00:44:35]
THERAPIST: And it's interesting. I finished reading the book and then like if you read... I don't know how much of it you've already read, but to a remarkable degree, given how little was known a lot of people made a theory thereafter. It was something like a project for scientific psychology and other thesis.
But and, I mean, in a pretty abstract way and the way I'm quite sure it would be possible to get a lot more personal specificity, well that probably characterizes what's going on for you. (laughter). I think you can't write and speak of certain things because of traumatic experiences that are sort of connected and horrifying, overwhelming feelings that go along with them. I mean, that's a very generic way to put it. I think there's a lot more specificity to be thought about. What's going on with you in particular and how what's happened to you, how much it has to do with your upbringing, and what of that that doesn't have to do with it. I think there's a lot more (inaudible at 00:46:45) to be gotten about all that, but I just go back to the end of the story, not just because I have a theory direct to that but (inaudible at 00:46:56) thing that what he's saying. And sort of the feel that this has in various ways to me. [00:47:01]
CLIENT: I'll find it somewhere. Usually online.
THERAPIST: Sure yeah. Sure. Alright, well we should stop for now. I hope work comes through.
CLIENT: I hope so too. Well we'll see you next week. Thanks.
THERAPIST: Sure. See you next week.
