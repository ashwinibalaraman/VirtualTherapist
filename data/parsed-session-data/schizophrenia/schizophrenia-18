<b>Description of the Disorder</b>
[p. <i>291</i>]

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is an
Axis II personality disorder characterized
by a pervasive inability to regulate emotions
as well as behaviors associated with those
emotions. The <i>DSM-IV</i> (American Psychiatric
Association [APA], 1994) describes BPD
as "a pervasive pattern of instability of
interpersonal relationships, self-image, and
affects, and marked impulsivity beginning
by early adulthood and present in a variety
of contexts"(p. 654). Five of nine diagnostic
criteria must be met in order for a person to
be diagnosed with the disorder:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Frantic attempts to avoid real or
imagined abandonment
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Unstable and intense relationships
alternating between idealization and
devaluation
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Markedly unstable self-image or
sense of self (e.g., feeling like one
embodies evil or does not exist)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
4. Potentially self-damaging impulsive
behavior in at least two areas, such
as binge eating, sex, drinking, or
spending
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
5. Suicidal or parasuicidal (i.e., self-mutilating)
behavior
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
6. Affective instability and reactivity of
mood lasting a few hours to a few
days
</p>
</td></tr>

Linehan (1993a, chap. 1) reorganized
the <i>DSM-IV</i> diagnostic criteria into five
spheres of dysregulation. The first and
primary sphere is emotion dysregulation.
Borderline individuals tend to be emotionally
labile and experience episodic depression,
anxiety, and anger. The experience of
anxiety and sadness is quite intense, even
for those without comorbid anxiety or
mood disorders (Comtois, Cowley,
Dunner, &amp; Roy-Byrne, 1999). Linehan
(1993a) has likened the individual with
BPD to an individual with third-degree
burns covering his or her body. Analogous
to the burn victim's experience of physical

[p. <i>292</i>]

The second sphere, behavioral dysregulation,
involves extreme and problematic
impulsive behavior. Examples of behavioral
dyscontrol include binge eating, substance
abuse, impulsive spending, parasuicidal
behavior (i.e., deliberate self-harm without
the intent to die), and suicidal behavior.
These behaviors typically function to regulate
or cope with intense emotion, but
generate chaos and ultimately more pain.
Although all of these behaviors are self-damaging,
occurrence of parasuicidal and
suicidal behavior is most alarming and life
threatening. Severity of parasuicidal behavior
ranges from minor self-harm (e.g.,
superficial scratches) to accidental death.
Cutting is the most common parasuicidal
behavior. Other methods include burning,
head banging, hitting oneself with a hammer
or similar object, and ingesting harmful
objects such as glass or pins. Parasuicide is
a hallmark of BPD in that no other <i>DSM-IV</i>
disorder lists it among the diagnostic criteria.
Nearly 75% of borderline individuals
engage in parasuicidal behavior (Clarkin,
Widiger, Frances, Hurt, &amp; Gilmore, 1983;
Cowdry, Pickar, &amp; Davies, 1985). Borderline
individuals also engage in self-harm
behavior with the intent to die. BPD is associated
more closely with attempted and
completed suicide than with any other mental
disorder. Nearly 10% of all individuals
diagnosed with BPD die by suicide (Frances,
Fyer, &amp; Clarkin, 1986). Rates of suicide
and parasuicide in BPD decrease with age,
with the highest risk period in young adulthood
(Linehan, 1993a).


The third sphere, interpersonal dysregulation,
encompasses a number of dysfunctional
relationship patterns. Borderline
individuals often have chaotic and conflictual
relationships. Their assessment of others
tends to swing from idealization to devaluation.
Even with the most conflicted relationships,
they are highly sensitive to
criticism and fear rejection. To allay this
fear, they may engage in extreme efforts to
avoid abandonment.


The fourth sphere, cognitive dysregulation,
is marked by dichotomous ("all-or-nothing")
thinking and cognitive rigidity. In
states of intense emotion, concentration and
problem solving may be severely impaired.
Paranoid ideation and dissociative behavior,
ranging from trancelike states to complete
dissociation, are also common in this
sphere of dysregulation.


The fifth sphere, self dysregulation,
refers to identity instability and chronic
feelings of emptiness. Individuals with BPD
frequently report not knowing who they are
or what they want. They commonly follow
the lead of those around them and judge the
validity of their own opinions and perceptions
on the basis of reaction of others.
Thus, their identity is so context specific
that they have no stable sense of self.

<b>Epidemiology</b>

The prevalence rate of BPD is about 2%
in the general population and about 10%
in psychiatric outpatient populations
(Widiger &amp; Frances, 1989; Widiger &amp;
Weissman, 1991). In inpatient settings,
prevalence rates jump to about 20% (Kroll,
Sines, &amp; Martin, 1981). Fifty percent of
personality-disordered inpatients are diagnosed
with BPD (Widiger &amp; Weissman, 1991).


The most robust demographic feature
of individuals with BPD is gender. Nearly
75% of individuals diagnosed with BPD are
women (Swartz, Blazer, George, &amp;
Winfield, 1990; Widiger &amp; Frances, 1989).
Age is consistently negatively associated

[p. <i>293</i>]

Comorbidity of Axis I disorders with
BPD is high. Individuals with BPD are commonly
diagnosed with major depressive
disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders
(especially posttraumatic stress disorder),
substance abuse disorders, and bulimia (see
Linehan et al., 1999, for a review). Gender-specific
patterns of comorbidity have been
found, with males tending to show higher
rates of comorbid substance-related disorders
and females tending to show higher
rates of eating disorders (Zanarini et al.,
1998a). Complexity is the most notable
feature of the Axis I diagnostic picture for
individuals with BPD. In discriminating
borderline individuals from those with
other personality disorders, a complex
pattern of comorbidity has been shown to
have both predictive power (i.e., sensitivity)
and discriminant power (i.e., specificity)
(Zanarini, Gunderson, &amp; Frankenburg,
1989). Zimmerman and Mattia (1999)
found that approximately 70% of their
BPD sample received a diagnosis of three or
more current Axis I disorders, and nearly
50% were diagnosed with four or more
current Axis I disorders.


Zanarini et al. (1998b) compared
borderline individuals and other personality-disordered
individuals on their rates of
comorbid Axis II pathology. Rates of paranoid,
avoidant, and dependent personality
disorders were considerably higher among
those with BPD than among those with
other Axis II disorders. In contrast,
Becker and colleagues (Becker, Grilo,
Edell, &amp; McGlashan, 2000) found that
only other cluster-B personality disorders
(histrionic PD and narcissistic PD) were
significantly comorbid with BPD.


In summary, the prototypic borderline
personality-disordered individual would be
a young Caucasian woman with a history of
psychiatric hospitalization. She would be
diagnosed with at least three Axis I disorders,
one of which would be a mood disorder
or anxiety disorder. She would also present
with characteristics of other personality
disorders in addition to BPD.

<b>Assessment</b>

The diagnostic assessment of BPD is complicated
by a number of factors. First, without
longitudinal observation, the data available
to the diagnostician come through two primary
sources--snapshot observation and
self-report information. Unfortunately, at-the-moment
data available to an observer
may not be characteristic of the individual's
behavior and/or affect. Likewise, self-report
data may be unreliable due to the reporter's
memory and interpretation of his or her own
behavior and affect state. Furthermore, a
cross-sectional sample of BPD-related behavior
may be difficult to distinguish from various
Axis I syndromes (Skodol &amp; Oldham,
1991). It is recommended that, whenever
possible, diagnoses be based on longitudinal
observation; unfortunately, such data are
usually hard to obtain.


High rates of comorbidity also complicate
the diagnostic picture. Typically,
borderline individuals carry a cluster of
comorbid disorders, all with unique
characteristics (Zimmerman &amp; Mattia,
1999). The relationship of comorbid Axis I
disorders to BPD is varied ranging from

[p. <i>294</i>]

Another complication arises from the
diagnostic criteria for BPD itself. The number
of <i>DSM-IV</i> criteria for BPD (9) is
almost double the minimum number
required for the diagnosis (5), allowing for
numerous behavioral presentations of the
disorder. Therefore, a diagnostically homogeneous
group of individuals could be
behaviorally heterogeneous (Comtois,
Levensky, &amp; Linehan, 1999). This fact
restricts the assumptions that can be drawn
about an individual when all that is known
is that the person carries a diagnosis of
BPD. For an assessment to be useful, it
should be behaviorally (i.e., phenomenologically)
focused as well as categorically (i.e.,
diagnostically) focused.


Information germane to assessment
clarity should be gathered from a number
of sources, including the individual, his
or her prior psychiatric records, concurrent
providers, and significant others.
Information can be gathered in an unstructured
or semistructured format (e.g., PAS)
(Tyrer, 1988). Collateral sources provide
essential data regarding the chronicity and
pervasiveness of problem behaviors.


Research supports the use of self-report
inventories such as PDQ-R (Hyler, Oldham,
Kellman, &amp; Doidge, 1992) and PIQ II
(Widiger, 1987) as diagnostic screening
tools for BPD (e.g., Patrick, Links, van
Reekum, &amp; Mitton, 1995). Those endorsing
BPD symptomatology on a self-report
screening can be assessed more thoroughly
using one of a number of semistructured
interviews developed to assess personality
disorders, such as DIB-R (Zanarini,
Gunderson, Frankenburg, &amp; Chauncey,
1989), IPDE (Loranger, 1995), or SCID-II
(First, Spitzer, Gibbons, Williams, &amp;
Benjamin, 1996). Assessment of comorbid
Axis I conditions can be accomplished
through a clinical interview following the
<i>DSM-IV</i> (APA, 1994) or a semistructured
interview such as the SCID (First, Spitzer,
Gibbons, &amp; Williams, 1995) or the CIDI
(Wittchen, Kessler, Zhao, &amp; Abelson, 1995),
the latter of which requires little training
to administer.


Behavioral observation can provide
insight into the individual's cognitive style
(e.g., dichotomous thinking, rigidity, self
invalidation); sensitivity; and reactivity of
affect, judgment, and insight. However,
individuals with BPD may experience
greater psychiatric disturbance than is
evident in their behavioral presentation
(EdeII, Joy, &amp; Yehuda, 1990). Therefore, it
is useful to inquire beyond clinical observation
and diagnostic assessment by gathering
information concerning concomitant problems
such as disruptive affective states (e.g.,
Brief Symptom Inventory) (Derogatis &amp;
Spencer, 1982), maladaptive cognitive
patterns, and interpersonal and occupational
functioning (e.g., Outcome Questionnaire--
45) (Lambert &amp; Hill, 1994). It is also essential
to take a detailed relationship history
and assess for identity instability.


Given the relationship between BPD
and suicidal behavior, it is imperative to
take a thorough history of all prior suicidal
and parasuicidal behaviors--including
detailed contextual information and a
detailed history of related hospitalizations
--in order to assess short-- and longterm
risk. Included in this assessment is an
inquiry into suicide-related behavior, such
as suicidal ideation; communications of
suicidality; expectancies and beliefs regarding
suicide; and suicide-related affect
(e.g., apathy, depression, and cognition

however, another combination of the diagnostic criteria would paint a different picture.
As mentioned earlier, the experiences of those with BPD are varied. Not all of

because that, too, would not be representative of the typical phenomenology of individuals
with BPD.</div>
is a single, 32-year-old Caucasian
female. She experiences her emotional world
as a roller coaster, sometimes running
smoothly and sometimes thrashing her
about. Amy often feels "hijacked" by her
emotions, feeling as though she is "along for
the ride" wherever her emotions take her.
Her most troubling emotions are sadness,
anxiety, and shame. She has struggled with
depression since her teenage years and is
now typically melancholic. Superimposed on
her melancholy are brief bouts of "paralyzing"
depression, sometimes relegating her to
bed for days. She is troubled by attacks of
anxiety during which she cannot sleep, feels
sick to her stomach, and becomes immobilized
by her worries and second guessing.
She regularly doubts her emotional reaction
to situations and her interpretations of events,
frequently questioning whether she is thinking
and feeling "the right way." When criticized,
she is initially angry, but her anger is
quickly replaced by shame concerning the
focus of criticism. She is hesitant to state
preferences or offer opinions without first
feeling that they will be well received.


In the face of intense distress, Amy finds
relief by cutting herself. Amy does not
remember ever reading about or being
exposed to self-harm. At age 16, following a
fight with her mother, Amy felt an urge to
cut herself while shaving. She pressed down
on the safety razor, slid it sideways along her
thigh, and felt a sense of emotional relief.
Since then, the frequency of her cutting has
vacillated over the years, ranging from
monthly to several times a week. For Amy,
antecedents to cutting involve high levels of
agitation or self-loathing, and cutting brings
a sense of calm or emotional relief. She typically
uses razor blades and cuts on her upper
thigh in order to conceal scars. Her wounds
usually require nothing more than adhesive
bandages or gauze and tape; however, she
has cut deeper because "the superficial cuts
weren't enough" and has required stitches.


Amy has a history of multiple suicide
attempts. She was 19 and a sophomore in
college at the time of her first suicide
attempt. She ingested 25 pills of her antidepressant
medication following a fight with
her boyfriend. She took the pills and then
told her roommate, who drove her to a local
hospital where she was admitted and stayed
for 4 days. Since that time, she has made six
other suicide attempts (all by overdose),
ranging in lethality from requiring no
medical intervention to being in intensive
care for 3 days. She has been hospitalized five
times following suicide attempts. Her most
recent attempt was 3 months ago following
an argument with her boyfriend in which he
was talking about ending the relationship.
She was alone in her apartment when she
ingested a bottle of over-the-counter sleeping
pills with a bottle of wine. Her boyfriend,
feeling unsettled about how their phone conversation
had ended, tried to call her back
later that evening. When she did not answer,
he drove over to her apartment and found
her unconscious. She was medically treated
in intensive care for a day and then transferred
to inpatient psychiatry for 6 days.


<i><b>History</b></i>


Amy's biological parents are divorced
and live in the same city in which she resides.

[p. <i>296</i>]

During Amy's teenage years, her
mother was quite depressed and became
competitive about the amount of time Amy
spent with her as compared with her
ex-husband. She accused Amy frequently of
loving her father more than her. Although
merely executing the ¡oint custody arrangement,
Amy's mother would accuse Amy of
being selfish, saying "I wouldn't be so
depressed if I had you all to myself." Amy
felt that she could not keep both of her
parents happy and yet needed to try.


During her grade school years, Amy's
academic performance was unremarkable.
By early high school, she began to struggle
under the stress of her parents' divorce. Her
father told her frequently that she was
smarter than her grades reflected, and that
if she "wanted to amount to anything," she
had to do better. Amy began to fear tests
and dislike school, yet was always clear in
her own mind that she would go to college
because it was expected of her. As her
school performance declined, Amy became
less social and had few friends. Her friendships
and relationships with boyfriends
were intense and short-lived, often "burning
them out" with her problems. After
graduation, Amy went to community college
for 2 years and transferred to a nursing
program, where she received her degree.


At the time of her parents' divorce,
Amy went to counseling briefly because of
her poor academic performance. She was
diagnosed with clinical depression and
prescribed an antidepressant, which she
interpreted as additional evidence that she
was the problem in the family. After a brief
time, she terminated therapy, believing the
therapist did not understand. She continued
on her antidepressant medication under the
management of her primary care physician.
Amy did not see another therapist until her
senior year in high school, when her mother
noticed a recent cut on her leg that Amy
could not convincingly explain away as she
had on a few occasions over the prior year.
Grudgingly, she saw a therapist and was
diagnosed with major depression and generalized
anxiety disorder. She terminated prematurely
with this therapist because Amy
felt that the therapy was a "waste of time."
Amy had little interest in speaking to therapists
because, in her mind, they could not
make her a better person and so could not
help. In all, Amy has worked with four therapists,
none of whom she believes helped.


Apart from those who initiate contact
with her, Amy rarely socializes, believing
that she will ultimately be rejected once
people get to know her. With the few
friends she has, she subordinates her own
desires and opinions and follows their
lead as to activities. When a relationship
becomes conflicted, Amy will often "sense"
that rejection and abandonment are
inevitable and opt to end that relationship.
Amy's problems with emotion regulation
negatively affect her relationships with
others. She has difficulty regulating her
emotional intensity, identifying her own feelings
accurately, and interpreting nonverbal
expressions of emotions in others (problems
common to individuals with BPD) (Levine,
Marziali, &amp; Hood, 1997). Each of these
difficulties impairs Amy's interpersonal
functioning in kind.


She has been in an intimate relationship
with a man for about 4 months that she

[p. <i>297</i>]

<i><b>Employment</b></i>


Amy is currently employed as a nurse in
a nursing home facility. She has worked at
her current facility for 9 months and in the
nursing field for 5 years. This is her fourth
placement in 5 years. With each of her prior
employers, she began the job with a sense of
having a fresh start (and of "waiting for the
other shoe to drop"). Inevitably, some kind
of interpersonal tension developed that
would "swing" her perception of the person
involved and, ultimately, her perception of
the place of employment. She began to
simultaneously devalue her job site and fear
that they were losing favor with her, and
she began to fear being fired. In combination
with outside stressors, Amy's fear of
being fired, her dread of interpersonal
tension (secondary to impaired interpersonal
problem-solving skills), and her polarized
negative feelings about her workplace led to
exacerbations in parasuicidal behavior,
frequent absenteeism due to "paralyzing"
anxiety, and increased suicidal behavior. At
two of her Jobs, she went on medical leave
secondary to psychiatric hospitalizations for
suicide attempts. With all three of her prior
jobs, she exhausted all her vacation days
and sick days on missing work due to emotional
lability. She was fired from two of her
jobs for missing work too frequently; the
other job she quit, believing she would
inevitably be fired for the same reason.


In her current position, her supervisor
evaluates her work as typically above average.
Notably, Amy is seen as conscientious,
skilled at forming good rapport with patients,
and technically skilled. When there are criticisms
in her review, she feels her supervisor
has glimpsed her "true nature" and has seen
that she is not good enough. Although
achievement is important to Amy, the imagined
interpersonal consequences of failure
(e.g., rejection by others, being seen as a failure)
are most disconcerting to her. Amy's
supervisor also notes that she has frequently
called in to work "too upset to come in."


Amy's mood at work is unpredictable,
making it difficult for coworkers to know
what to expect from her in terms of her
affect and level of performance. At times, it
seems to other staff that Amy is "somewhere
else" and has difficulty concentrating.
Sometimes, she misunderstands that a
particular task is her responsibility. On
other occasions, she will work much slower
than usual and appear as though "in a fog."


Amy's supervisor has received comments
from coworkers that they feel they
"walk on eggshells" around Amy. They perceive
her as "hypersensitive," insecure, and
unstable (Carroll, Hoenigmann-Stovall,
King, Wienhold, &amp; Whitehead, 1998).
They feel that she reacts to criticism or joking
around too seriously and becomes either
defensive or ashamed; consequently, most
are careful not to joke around with Amy
(Bond, Paris, &amp; Zweig-Frank, 1994). Amy
ends up oscillating between feeling "picked
on" and "left out."

[p. <i>298</i>]

In the first 6 months of working at the
nursing home, Amy missed a week of work
secondary to a psychiatric hospitalization
after a suicide attempt. Upon return, her
coworkers' sense of needing to walk on
eggshells increased as curiosity spread
about Amy's "breakdown." Although no
one knew details or even about the suicide
attempt, Amy feared that somehow everyone
knew. Not wanting to be treated like a
mental patient, she did not confide in anyone
at work about what had happened.
She is uncomfortable about her supervisor,
the human resource department, knowing
about her psychiatric problems and feels
that if they knew "all of it," they would fire
her. As it is, she believes that her "mental
patient behavior" has given management
ample reason to want to get rid of her.


Despite her problems at work, Amy
enjoys being a nurse. When she is performing
well at work, her feelings of worthlessness
temporarily remit. Although she has
overdosed on her own prescribed medication,
she has never abused or taken medications
accessible to her through her work
duties because she opines that would violate
a trust the nursing home has placed in her.

<b>Precipitating Conditions</b>

<i><b>Biosocial Model of BPD</b></i>


Linchan (1993a, chap. 2) has posited a
biosocial model of borderline personality
disorder. This model suggests that BPD
develops out of the transaction between an
emotionally dysregulated individual and
what is termed an "invalidating environment."
An emotionally dysregulated individual
is one whose autonomic nervous
system reacts intensely to relatively low
levels of stress and is slow to return to
baseline. Furthermore, the emotionally
dysregulated individual has impaired
emotion modulation abilities; these include
the ability to inhibit inappropriate reactions
to strong affect, regulate physiological
arousal associated with affect, sustain attention
in the presence of strong affect, and
work toward non-mood-dependent goals
(Gottman &amp; Katz, 1990). Emotion dysregulation
is theorized to be biologically based
and may be due to factors such as genetics,
intrauterine abnormalities, or early childhood
trauma that leaves biological marks
(Figueroa &amp; Silk, 1997).


An invalidating environment, postulated
to be the contributing environmental
factor, is described as one that trivializes,
ignores, or punishes the individual's private
experiences (i.e., thoughts, feelings, and
perceptions of events). This invalidation
communicates to the individual that his or
her private experiences are incorrect, inappropriate,
and unimportant. Invalidation
occurs on a continuum from well-intentioned
statements that are experienced as invalidating
(e.g., "Why are you so upset?" "It's
not that bad.") to physical and sexual
abuse. Invalidating environments tend to
oversimplify the ease with which problems
are solved, so that when an individual
encounters obstacles to achieving desired
ends, he or she is, in essence, told to "just
do it." Thus, the individual never learns to
tolerate distress and solve difficulties. Over
time, the individual learns to self-invalidate
and trust others' reactions to them as indications
of how to think and feel.


Individual and environmental conditions
are hypothesized to continually influence
and transform one another, over time,
resulting in the individual becoming more
emotionally reactive and behaviorally dysregulated,
and the environment becoming
more invalidating. For instance, an individual
with extreme emotional vulnerability is likely
to draw out more and more invalidating

[p. <i>299</i>]

<i><b>Exacerbating Conditions</b></i>


Within the framework of BPD, a chronic
and pervasive disorder, precipitating conditions
refer to conditions that tend to exacerbate
symptomatology, such as extreme
emotional displays, impulsive behaviors,
dissociative behavior, and parasuicidal
behavior. Creating an inventory of common
precipitating conditions for emotional intensity
and related problematic behavior in
borderline individuals is difficult for a variety
of reasons. Given the borderline individual's
emotional sensitivity and reactivity, he or she
is more likely to respond to minor Stressors
than are other people, and is likely to have
more extreme responses. Furthermore, the
specific natures of antecedents that increase
symptomatology are idiosyncratic from person
to person; what one individual reacts to,
another may not. Additionally, the context in
which stressors occur requires (yet rarely
receives) as much attention as the stressor
itself. This means that a stressor that seriously
affects an individual at one point in
time may not at another because of an
altered context. One such contextual domain
is health; poor diet, use of mood-altering
drugs, and sleep disturbances (to name a few
health-related factors) moderate the impact
of stress on the individual.


Despite these difficulties, one loosely
generalizable precipitating condition that
applies to borderline individuals is the
impact of interpersonal problems (e.g.,
Figueroa &amp; Silk, 1997; Labonte &amp; Paris,
1993; Whewell, Ryman, Bonanno, &amp;
Heather, 2000). Two of the nine <i>DSM-IV</i>
(APA, 1994) criteria for BPD are interpersonally
oriented. Common problematic
interpersonal themes include rejection,
abandonment, criticism, and messages of
invalidation. Many borderline individuals
are especially sensitive to achievement-oriented
events, such as failed expectations,
poor performance reviews, and criticism of
work product. These events can cut to the
heart of core beliefs of worthlessness just as
interpersonal events can resonate with core
beliefs of unlovability. Whereas some may
experience these achievement-oriented events
as such, others may experience the sting of
these events through interpersonal pathways.
For example, the more serious impact of
being demoted at work may be the impression
it gives to others. Because interpersonal
sequelae can arise from both achievement
and interpersonal events (whereas achievement
sequelae are typically limited to
achievement events), those who are significantly
vulnerable to interpersonal events (like
individuals with BPD) are doubly vulnerable
to negative events (Goff, 1998).

<b>Course and Prognosis</b>

Borderline personality disorder emerges in
the late teens and early 20s. It is a chronic
disorder, presenting symptoms for many
years. Chronicity studies (e.g., Links,
Heslegrave, &amp; van Reekum, 1998) suggest
diagnostic stability rates of between 50%
and 70% at 7 years' follow-up, with the
higher stability rates belonging tu the most
severe. Level of functioning remains relatively
stable as well (e.g., psychiatric hospitalization
rates) (Dahl, 1986), with the

[p. <i>300</i>]

The prognosis for individuals with BPD
has been generally poor. Nearly all individuals
with BPD have received outpatient psychiatric
treatment (Perry, Herman, van der
Kolk, &amp; Hoke, 1990). Unfortunately, such
individuals tend to respond poorly or
decompensate in outpatient therapy. Their
treatment tends to be anything but smooth.
They often terminate prematurely, or their
therapist burns out and terminates (Linchan,
Cochran, Mar, Levensky, &amp; Comtois,
2000). Treatment is undermined by pervasive
noncompliance in keeping appointments,
completing therapy assignments, and
taking medications as prescribed. Lengthy
hospitalizations and worsening of comorbid
disorders often fragment the therapeutic
process. Borderline personality disorder is
also associated with worse outcomes in the
treatment of comorbid Axis I disorders, such
as major depression, substance abuse,
bulimia, and PTSD (see Linchan &amp; Heard,
1999, for a review).


Brief improvements are seen with psychiatric
hospitalizations for crisis stabilization;
however, improvements are attributable to
the temporary separation of the individual
from the stressor. The relief provided by
the hospitalization is transitory because the
individual then returns to his or her natural
environment no more capable of tolerating
distress or problem solving. Although some
of these capabilities can be taught in inpatient
settings, they often are not. Time constraints,
competing institutional demands,
staff training issues, and heterogeneous
inpatient populations make inpatient units
problematic settings for enhancing patient
capabilities. What skills patients are taught
are often poorly generalized to their natural
environment. Furthermore, crisis-stabilizing
hospitalizations can be iatrogenic, in that
the temporary relief associated with
hospitalizarion reinforces the behaviors
linked to admission--typically parasuicidal
or suicidal behavior.


In contrast to the plethora of discouraging
results of standard treatments, a
newer treatment, Dialectical Behavior
Therapy (DBT), has provided hope. Numerous
studies (see Koerner &amp; Dimeff, 2000,
for a review) have demonstrated the association
between DBT and decreases in parasuicidal
behavior, psychiatric hospitalization,
anger, suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness,
and dissociation, and with increases
in client retention, overall level of functioning,
and overall social adjustment.


<i><b>Referral Suggestions</b></i>


When possible, referral to a DBT program
or DBT-informed therapist is recommended.
Referring entities may do well to
suggest that an individual obtain assistance
for specific problematic behavior rather
than for a diagnosis. Diagnostic labeling
often triggers reactions of defensiveness and
denial, whereas observation-based descriptions
of behavior elicit less negative
responses. Individuals are often referred to
the Portland DBT Program (a privatepractice
outpatient clinic specializing in DBT)
for problems such as depression, anxiety,
anger, emotional sensitivity, cutting impulsivity,
and problems relating to others.
Although my colleagues and I discuss with
clients their diagnoses, we begin the discussion
with problematic experiences (e.g.,
emotional and behavioral dysregulation)
rather than diagnosis. We do this for pragmatic
and clinical reasons, and to avoid
becoming entangled with the deprecative
reputation of the diagnosis. By the time the
discussion moves to diagnosis, the diagnosis
is seen as descriptive and sometimes experienced
as validating--that others have
similar problems.

<b><i>Brief Description</i></b>


Developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan and
her colleagues at the University of
Washington, DBT is an empirically validated
cognitive-behavioral treatment for
borderline personality disorder (Linehan,
1993a, 1993b).
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_37566');">[note]</a><div id="_note_37566" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">3. The information presented in this section is based primarily on Marsha M.
Linehan's extensive writing on DBT. Readers are advised to consult her text on the
subject (Linehan, 1993a) and the companion skills training manual (Linehan,
1993b) for a more thorough understanding of the model. For more information
on training in DBT, contact the Behavioral Technology Transfer Group at (206)
675-8588.</div>
DBT is a behavioral treatment
drawing heavily from an area of
applied behavior analysis called self-management.
Self-management of behavior
is a process by which clients learn how to
define problems behaviorally, monitor these
behaviors in context, analyze the information
according to models of learning, and
develop analysis-based solutions. In DBT,
problems are defined, analyzed, and solved
in a collaborative fashion. Cause is not
inferred based on personality traits, drive
states, or self-object structures, but is
hypothesized according to operant, respondent,
and observational learning models.
Solutions usually fall into one of four categories:
skills training, cognitive restructuring,
exposure techniques, or contingency
management. Change-based therapy with
borderline individuals often recapitulates
their earlier invalidating environment and
results in escalated and extreme responses
by client and therapist alike. Thus, in DBT,
behavior therapy is balanced with acceptance
therapy and housed in a framework
that is "dialectical" in nature.


An area of classical philosophy, dialectics
promotes synthesizing opposing perspectives
or positions. A dialectical perspective
calls for a shift from a "black or white"
stance to one that is "black and white."
Dialectics continually searches for what is
left out. Rather than asking for a surrender
of an initial stance, it calls for the recognition
of the truth in the opposing stance. In
the therapy context, dialectical harmony is
achieved by continually balancing treatment
strategies (e.g., focusing on change and
acceptance, treating the client and his or her
environment) and client experiences (e.g.,
synthesizing pure emotion with reason,
drawing from logic and intuition).


The core acceptance strategy in DBT is
validation. The essence of validation is to
communicate to clients that their responses
are real and that they make sense and are
understandable within their current or
historical context. Validation is not used
simply to make clients feel better, but is
applied strategically to (a) provide a balance
to the push for change, (b) reinforce clinical
progress, (c) teach self-validation, and
(d) strengthen the therapeutic relationship.
Mindfulness is the core acceptance skill
taught in DBT. Drawn from certain Eastern
meditation practices, mindfulness is defined
as observing one's internal experience (i.e.,
thoughts, feelings, images, and physical sensations)
and external behaviors (i.e., overt
actions) in context in the present moment.
The quality of this experience is nonjudgmental;
no attempt is made to judge the
experience as good or bad, or to control or
change the experience. In short, mindfulness
is about focusing on one thing in the
moment and accepting that moment without
reservation with a willingness to do what is
needed in order to respond effectively.


<b><i>Treatment Stages</i></b>


DBT provides a stage-based hierarchical
structure around which to organize the
treatment of mult¡problem clients. Each
stage corresponds to specific treatment
targets. The pretreatment stage of DBT
corresponds to "getting ready" targets:
assessment, orientation to treatment, and
establishing initial commitment to participate
in therapy. Pretreatment is followed by

[p. <i>302</i>]

<i><b>Multimodal Treatment</b></i>


Clients in DBT participate in two
primary modes of therapy: individual therapy
and skills training group. The chief function
of individual therapy is to motivate the
individual to use his or her most skillful
behavior. To that end, individual therapists
provide telephone consultation between sessions
as needed to assist the individual in
generalizing skills to his or her natural environment.
With both the individual therapy
and telephone consultation, emotional,
cognitive, and environmental obstacles
for skillfulness are assessed and treated.
Obstacles to optimal skillfulness are treated
through (a) manipulating consequences of
behavior to change contingencies that promote
dysfunctional over functional behavior,
(b) exposure to reduce emotions and
avoidant behaviors that prevent effective
action, or (c) cognitive modification to
change distorted or extreme thinking. In
dialectical tension with motivating clients to
be optimally skillful is the task of accepting
and validating problem-solving complexity
and emotional pain (see Linehan, 1993a,
for a detailed description of individual therapy
strategies, including problem-solving
strategies, validation strategies, and stylistic
strategies).


Whereas individual therapy and telephone
consultation improve client motivation,
group skills training improves client
capabilities. Training occurs in four primary
skill sets: mindfulness, distress tolerance,
emotion regulation, and interpersonal
effectiveness (Linehan, 1993b). Mindfulness
skills increase capabilities for nonjudgmental,
in-the-moment awareness. The purpose
of distress tolerance is to manage distress
in ways that do not make matters worse.
Emotion regulation involves increasing
mindfulness to emotions and learning to
increase and decrease various emotional
states. Interpersonal effectiveness skills
include increasing mindfulness to relationships,
maintaining relationships, and building
self-respect in interpersonal situations.
Skills training is accomplished primarily
through didactic strategies such as lecture,
discussion, in-group practice, and homework
assignments.


A final treatment modality is the therapist
consultation group. Although the client
is not physically present for this mode of
treatment, it remains a central aspect of
DBT. The consultation group targets therapists'
own motivation and capabilities for
doing effective therapy. It is, in essence,
"therapy for the therapists." The team reinforces
the therapist for doing effective therapy,
because client-based reinforcements may be
associated with the therapist acting ineffectively.
For instance, a client may be pleased
with the therapist for deviating from the

[p. <i>303</i>]

<b><i>Time Element</i></b>


Implementation of DBT requires attendance
at weekly individual therapy and concurrent
weekly skills training group; length
of treatment varies. Original protocols
called for an initial 1-year commitment to
therapy (Linehan, 1993a, p. 112). Logistics-motivated
modifications have produced
protocols of varying lengths. For instance,
in the Portland DBT Program (described
more in Kim &amp; Goff, 2000), the initial commitment
and length of the skills training
group is 6 months. Although the skills training
group imposes a fixed-length structure,
clients vary in the amount of pretreatment
needed prior to entering the group to obtain
initial commitment, and in the amount of
post-skills training therapy needed. During
this 6-month to 1-year period, serious
behavioral dyscontrol (e.g., suicide attempts
and other self-harm behavior) is often
significantly reduced, sometimes even
eliminated, and behavioral skills are
implemented on a more regular basis.
Complaints related to mood and relationships
generally continue. Therapy is often
necessary beyond 6 months to continue
work on abiding Stage 1 problems and to
refine and strengthen newly acquired skills.
To this end, clients in our program are
offered the opportunity to enter a "Phase 2
group." The purpose of this group is to
refine skill knowledge and reinforce skillful
behavior. Whereas the initial 6-month skills
training group meets weekly for 2 hours
and requires concurrent individual therapy,
Phase 2 groups meet weekly for 90 minutes
and individual therapy is adjunctive. Clients
make commitments to Phase 2 groups in
3-month intervals.


Termination from treatment is often
difficult for individuals with BPD, and thus
services are slowly tapered over time. In this
way, problems that arise secondary to
decreased services can be addressed while
clients are still active in therapy. In our
experience, we have found that clients have
an easier time reducing individual therapy if
they remain in a skills training group during
the process.


<b><i>Side Effects of Treatment</i></b>


As with most psychosocial treatments,
symptomatology may worsen before
improving. Parasuicidal behavior and other
problematic impulsive behaviors function to
regulate emotion. As clients work to reduce
these problematic behaviors, they lose their
short-term benefit unless alternate methods
of emotion regulation and distress tolerance
are already in place. Furthermore, resisting
the urge to engage in impulsive behavior is
intensely difficult and can itself increase an
individual's emotional distress. Conversely,
the individual is spared the deleterious
effects of these behaviors if they are skillfully
resisted. In essence, tolerating distress,
including the distress of intense urges, does
not reduce pain, it simply prevents the pain
from becoming worse.


With mixed results, pharmacotherapy
commonly augments psychotherapy for
borderline individuals. The disorder per se
is not targeted, but rather areas of dysfunction,
including emotional lability (antidepressants
and anxiolytics); behavioral
dyscontrol (mood stabilizers and anticonvulsants);
and cognitive dysregulation, such as
transient psychotic symptoms or dissociation

[p. <i>304</i>]

<b><i>Workplace Accommodations</i></b>


DBT calls for few workplace accommodations
for the treatment of borderline individuals.
Allowing some form of brief,
self-initiated removal from stressful stimuli
would assist individuals in applying emotion
regulation skills. Emotionally dysregulated,
borderline individuals find it
exceedingly hard to focus on the present
moment and act skillfully. Mindfulness
skills are taught in DBT that promote a
sense of "groundedness" or "centeredness,"
characterized by present-minded thought
and effectiveness-oriented action. Briefly
stepping out of a stressful setting may be
conducive to becoming mindful. In effect, it
is "taking a breather." Additional accommodations
may include early release a few
days a week in order to attend therapy
(especially for skills training group, where
the meeting time of the group is less flexible),
and having available a private setting
where the individual could access urgent
telephone consultation if needed.


DBT encourages, and actually teaches,
environments to be validating of the difficulties
and needs of borderline individuals
(Kim &amp; Goff, 2000). Indeed, making an
accommodation is essentially functional
validation; it communicates through action
that the need is valid, like getting someone a
glass of water when the person is thirsty.
Dialectically, a basic tenet of DBT asserts
that clients need to function better regardless
of their situation or physical setting. A
related tenet says that clients may not have
caused their problems, but they must solve
them anyway. On one hand, making no
allowance for modifications may invalidate
the individual's struggle and hinder success.
Overmodifying may invalidate the individual's
capabilities and communicate that he
or she is fragile. The trick is to validate the
realness of the individual's problem without
invalidating his or her capabilities and
strengths. When made, modifications
should function to facilitate, yet still
require, skillful behavior on the part of the
individual.


The synthesis about accommodations
lies in DBT's approach of consulting with
the client rather than intervening directly in
his or her environment. This consultationto-the-client
approach channels solutions
through the client. Clients are coached to
present their requests in a manner that does
not damage their self-respect or the affected
relationship. Obstacles of having accommodations
made would be solved with the
client, and at the same time, the client
would be coached to tolerate the distress of
the situation.

<b>Maintenance of Gains/Relapse Prevention</b>

Even with good outcome data, DBT is not a
panacea for clients with borderline personality
disorder. Even while in treatment, clients
advance and regress over an indeterminable
period. Although this is understandable in

[p. <i>305</i>]

One such set of strategies concerns
methods of continuing therapy. Involvement
in an ongoing DBT skills training group
(such as a Phase 2 group described earlier),
allowance for occasional "booster" sessions
after formal therapy has ended, and even
participation in Internet-based therapeutic
discussion groups are all methods of extending
treatment. One specific example is an
Internet group whose members are all graduates
of DBT programs. The group shares
insights about and experiences of using DBT
skills, and provides peer-based encouragement
and instruction to act skillfully.


Dialectically, a second set of strategies
concerns the process of ending therapy.
Termination from therapy, if possible, should
occur only after clients complete Stage 2 of
therapy, where behaviors associated with
posttraumatic stress are treated. The work of
Stage 2 often precipitates relapses of Stage 1
behavior; therefore, this work is best done in
a context where the lapse into prior behavior
can be treated quickly. Additionally, as
suggested earlier, gradually tapering services
encourages the development of self-management
skills and greater independence
from the therapeutic relationship. Finally,
development of adequate social support in
the client's natural environment (and the
skills necessary to access the support) should
be a criterion for termination.


To further assist maintenance of client
gains and prevention of relapse, we have
added a self-management skills unit (Kim &amp;
Goff, 1999) to the units taught in standard
DBT to formalize the teaching of relapse
prevention strategies. The unit borrows
heavily from Marlatt and Gordon's (1985)
work in the area of relapse prevention.
Clients are taught about relapse cycles and
how to use other DBT skills to short-circuit
the cycle. They are also taught to analyze
behaviors according to learning principles
and to make changes in antecedents and
consequences in order to shape behavior.


<b><i>Workplace Strategies</i></b>


A maxim of behavioral psychology is
that behaviors that are reinforced are more
likely to occur. As supervisors note a
welcome change in behavior, they should
reinforce it through acknowledgement or
praise. Note that reinforcements are
idiosyncratic; some individuals do not
experience praise as reinforcing but instead
see praise as "the bar of expectation being
raised" and experience subsequent anxiety.
Also, it is important that reinforcing comments
or responses not sound patronizing.
A related suggestion is to validate (i.e.,
acknowledge nonjudgmentally) the individual's
report of emotion and the difficulty of
changing behavior. Supervisors should not
assume they know how to help, but rather
ask the individual if there is something they
can do to help. In addition to providing
content as to what would be helpful, the
individual is communicating to what
extent he or she wants the supervisor to be
involved. Supervisors are encouraged to be
patient, to the extent that business needs
allow, recognizing that when learning new
behavior, practice is needed before the new
behavior comes naturally. They should be
mindful of the fact that the BPD employee is
interacting with his or her environment, and
they are encouraged to consider whether the
workplace is or is not validating.


For the most part, these suggestions
most likely parallel basic management strategies
for increasing productivity and job
satisfaction. For individuals with BPD, departures
from this style of management are more
likely to be distressing and ultimately contribute
to a loss of treatment gains.

<b>Summary</b>
[p. <i>306</i>]

Borderline personality disorder is characterized
by dysregulated (i.e., reactive and sensitive)
affect, impulsive behavior (including
suicidal and parasuicidal behavior), chaotic
relationships, black-or-white thinking, and
a transient sense of self. Its diverse presentation
and typically complex pattern of
comorbidity complicate diagnostic assessment
and the prediction of workplace difficulties.
Common work-relevant problems
include frequent hospitalizations, emotional
dysregulation and paranoia at work, interpersonal
problems with coworkers or
supervisors, and absences resulting from
impulsive behavior.


There have been few data about
effective treatments for BPD until recently.
DBT is an empirically validated cognitive-behavioral
therapy for borderline personality
disorder. Grounded in both behavioral
theory and Eastern meditative traditions, it
emphasizes change and acceptance. This
dialectic addresses simultaneously the two
fundamental problems for borderline
individuals: (a) They need to increase their
capabilities in a variety of domains, and
(b) they feel fatally flawed and struggle with
accepting themselves and their problems.


DBT is composed of individual therapy,
skills training group, and telephone consultation.
Each treatment modality functions
interdependently with the others to increase
clients' capabilities, increase their motivation
to change, and help generalize these
new behaviors to their natural environment.
Additionally, DBT's treatment team
approach enhances therapists' skills and
motivation to implement the treatment.
Supervisors in the workplace are invited to
function as part of this treatment team.
They can validate the individual's efforts
and reinforce his or her changes in behavior.
In managing the BPD employee, supervisors
should assume a stance of flexibility
(making accommodations that validate the
individual's needs) and benevolent inflexibility
(requiring skillfulness that validates
the individual's strengths and capabilities).
