BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you were telling me about the voices, so -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it, it's scary.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And uh, I, uh, I pray at night.  It seems to go away more and, uh, I've been having a pretty, pretty nice dreams.
<b>DR:</b> Now tell me about the dreams.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I'm standing on my deck and the whole entire yard, my yard is filled with roses on the deck that are about 5' tall and the whole yard is filled with all different various types of flowers.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And it's real sunny but hazy and it's really bright that you can't even see, but you still could see all the flowers and the roses.  It was, it was nice.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Good.  And now you were saying that you hear a voice saying you're going to die?
<b>PT:</b> It's, the voice is like a, a male, deep voice.  Uh, more like, uh, someone with authority.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You're going to die soon.  And now, the other one is more of like a scary one and it keeps saying die.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.  Now, have you been taking that Haldol, the haloperidol?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and have you noticed any difference with that?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, it's better.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so it's helped some.  How many are you taking?
<b>PT:</b> Just the 1 before I go to bed.
<b>DR:</b> You just take it at night?  Okay, no side effects?  No stiffness or anything?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.
<b>PT:</b> I'm kind of paranoid.  I'm, I'm scared.  Um, I'm constantly watching out for myself, you know, expecting, expecting the unexpected.
<b>DR:</b> All right, here's what I recommend.  That you increase to 3 of those pills at night, okay, which is 1.5 mg, and take 1 during the day, like after lunch.
<b>PT:</b> Am I crazy?
<b>DR:</b> No.  You're just hallucinating.
<b>PT:</b> I wish it was good hallucinations.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well the roses sound nice.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but they, they, but they can't be hallucinate, I really heard it.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Like -
<b>DR:</b> Like the voice?
<b>PT:</b> Like, like I'm hearing you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's how I heard it.
<b>DR:</b> Got you.
<b>PT:</b> How could that be a hallucination?
<b>DR:</b> Well, that is a hallucination because a hallucination is when you hear something or see something that looks real but it's not.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I heard it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, see what happens is in your brain, if your brain is stimulated in the right way, it's kind of like, you ever get banged on the head and you see stars and stuff like that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, you can have hallucinations that are more vivid in your brain and stuff like that.  Like sometimes you go in a dark room and you can see funny shapes and stuff like that, you know if you come in from a bright room into a dark room?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and you can see things, those are like uh, hallucinations, they actually uh, after images, but if your brain is getting stimulated in a certain way, sometimes you can have hallucinations.  People that have seizures sometimes, uh, before they have a seizure they have hallucinations.  One guy, you know that Warner Brothers thing that goes, "Do, do, do, do, do.  Do, do, do, do, do, do?"
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You know that, every time he would have a seizure he would get an aura like that.  He would see and hear that thing, and it would last for, like, you know, 15 seconds, and they knew he was going to have a seizure, so he just, you know, go lie down somewhere.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So -
<b>PT:</b> My daughter's doing well.
<b>DR:</b> Well that's good to hear.
<b>PT:</b> She's perking up.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  That's very good.
<b>PT:</b> Do you think, uh -
<b>DR:</b> You guys are getting along better, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, me and my daughter, yeah.  Me and, me and [NAME OTHER], uh, it's like the end of the world every day.  And we get a, we, I try to put a little humor to avoid a conflict and it works for a little bit.  And then I said she, when I, I'll give you an example.  She says, "I need the sander."  I says, "[NAME OTHER], the sander isn't important right now."  I says, "We have to get everything out of the kitchen because the contractors are coming in a couple days to redo the kitchen.  Sanding is not important."
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> She got mad and says, "You're yelling at me and you're, you're bossing me and, and you don't even know what I'm using the sander for," when I do know what she's using the sander for, for the shelf that's in the kitchen which is -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> That they're going to redo.  Why are you going to sand something?  So, she didn't talk to me for a day for that.
<b>DR:</b> She was sensitive to your criticism.
<b>PT:</b> She calls it yelling.  I call it talking.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I can find -
<b>DR:</b> But she thinks its criticism.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's her perception.
<b>PT:</b> And I -
<b>DR:</b> Some people, they tend to -
<b>PT:</b> I don't understand, I says, "Do you want me to speak softly, or, or can I, what, what do you want me to do?  Change my vocabulary?"  I don't, I don't understand what -
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes it's the way that it's approached.  You might say, oh wow, I see you're remodeling your kitchen.  Wow, what grade of sandpaper are you using?  How's that feel when you sand it?  Does that feel nice?  Wow.  Hey, are you getting new cabinets next week?  Wow, I wonder, what are you going to do with these old cabinets that's so important that you sand them?  And I'd say, Well, I was going to donate them to charity and I wanted them to look good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it, it's just a, it doesn't make sense some of the things she wants.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, of course.  She's not working on logic.  She's working on emotion and feeling.  Some people have a feeling preference.
<b>PT:</b> It's like Noah and his wife, and his wife tells him, uh, fix the roof.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Well, the flood's coming.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Fix the roof, so he fixes the roof.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> She's, what it is, it's a shelf space, it's like indented into the wall -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And we have shelves and it's, it was full, it was painted.  So she tried stripping it.  Didn't work and I told her, I says, they'll just redo it, [NAME OTHER].  Just leave it.  No, I want to do it.  So I come home from work last night and one side's tore out, the other side's, it's a mess.
<b>DR:</b> She, she dug in the drywall and the plaster lath or whatever?
<b>PT:</b> Had no idea what she was doing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, when you dig deep enough you'll find pipes.
<b>PT:</b> But then don't talk to me for a day because you're criticizing me.
<b>DR:</b> Well, she's probably upset with herself and you just make it painfully clear.
<b>PT:</b> Well anytime I'm, I, I, this, if I say this isn't going to work and it, and it, it doesn't -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Then she blames me for letting her do it, so I can blame her for it not working.  It don't make sense.
<b>DR:</b> You know, some people project, um, their feelings on others and that.
<b>PT:</b> We haven't had sex in 8 months.  I still have the Levitra in my drawer.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> I told her, I said, I'm going to cheat on you.
<b>DR:</b> What did she say?
<b>PT:</b> You're the one that has to wake up in the morning and look at yourself in the mirror.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's a good comeback.
<b>PT:</b> She's good.
<b>DR:</b> Uh -
<b>PT:</b> But she doesn't like sex.
<b>DR:</b> No?
<b>PT:</b> No, and I'm stuck between a hard place and God and -
<b>DR:</b> Well, you could have the marriage annulled saying my wife doesn't want sex.
<b>PT:</b> Gee, I mean, before my daughter, before she got pregnant, we were in the park, at night with a bottle of good wine.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, yeah, I mean, uh -
<b>DR:</b> It was more fun then, huh?
<b>PT:</b> It was fun.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Now it's a chore.
<b>DR:</b> Hm, wifely duty.  Yeah, I think the Bible says you're supposed to do it once a week.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, to teach, so it would, uh, sustain, it would sustain -
<b>DR:</b> Reproduction there.
<b>PT:</b> Not only, uh, but it would, uh, stop you from uh, wandering.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, with temptation.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's a good idea, too.
<b>PT:</b> Many times I wanted to pick up a prostitute or something but then that's against my principles.  I liked a good dinner and a movie first.
<b>DR:</b> Um, yeah.  Or you can get a escort.  They'll do that for you.
<b>PT:</b> Too expensive.
<b>DR:</b> Hm -
<b>PT:</b> And they're, and they're too, too, they don't have any uh, character.
<b>DR:</b> Um, some don't.
<b>PT:</b> I'm more of a person with simplicity.  I guess I'll just wait.
<b>DR:</b> Until she comes to her senses, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Who knows?  I'm doing the best I can.
<b>DR:</b> Are you getting sleep at night?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Are you eating?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> How much sleep do you get?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, 4, 5.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well, that's why I want you to take 3 pills at night and 1 during the day, okay?
<b>PT:</b> I'm really depressed.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I think I'm losing it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's why I want you to do this stuff now.  You're working during the day?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I work 3:00 to 11:00, but I took today and tomorrow off.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, 3:00 to 11:00.  If need be, we can have you go in the partial program.  You get more therapy.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, even, um, if we, if you just did the intensive outpatient program that is, um, like from 9:00 until 1:00.  Are you doing any individual therapy now?  [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> No, I haven't found a therapist yet.  I found one but then when I sat down and I talked to her she says, I can't help you.
<b>DR:</b> Well, we can have you see someone here for some additional stuff.  So you took the day off, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, let me see if [NAME OTHER] has got something.
<b>DR:</b> Does [NAME OTHER] have an opening today?
<b>DR:</b> Good, we've got a client for her.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Bye bye.  Okay, you're going to see [NAME OTHER] at 2:15.  She's in the PPO thing.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I think the more I try, the more I do good, things are coming back and -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?  Things are what?
<b>PT:</b> Just, bites me in the rear.  No matter what I do.
<b>DR:</b> I wouldn't say no matter what.  I can hear your frustration right now.  Seems like things are better with your daughter, so that's good.
<b>PT:</b> It's getting better.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And she, she doesn't want me to leave.  She told me that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] honest about it.  We need the money.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well you got to be patient with some of these things.  Did you quit smoking?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Hm, then you're right, you're going to die.
<b>PT:</b> I cut down on eating.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, well, that will probably help you, too.  It looks like you're still well fed.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How much you smoking?
<b>PT:</b> Half a pack a day.
<b>DR:</b> Um, how about you cut that out and go on the patch instead?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yep.
<b>PT:</b> I'm building a ship, and I haven't finished it yet.  I can't believe I'm worried about the ship more than my kitchen.
<b>DR:</b> Ship in a bottle?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, no, the USS Constitution.  It's this big.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, a model?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and my father painted me, he's an artist, he painted me a picture this big, that wide -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Of the USS Constitution out in water.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It was, uh, [INAUDIBLE], perfectly.
<b>DR:</b> It, what's it made out of, your model?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, it's plastic.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, like a kit?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I, I -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Painted every single part -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm at, uh, I'm almost done.  Alls I have to do is, uh, string up, uh, 32 strings and then put up the masses.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm done.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I think it has 32 cannons on it all the way around.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It was the most historic, uh, ship of the United States Navy -
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Ever built.
<b>DR:</b> Ship of the line.
<b>PT:</b> And went to war with France.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, they called it old iron side.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Yep.
<b>PT:</b> I got to get away.  I think I need a vacation.
<b>DR:</b> Where would you go?
<b>PT:</b> Germany.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, what's over there?
<b>PT:</b> I got, my mom's got friends and relatives there.  I can stay on [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Hm.  Sprechen sie Deutsch?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Ambition, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Ambition.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well you can learn quickly.
<b>PT:</b> The only thing I know is [INAUDIBLE] and -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But, uh, uh, um, I'm, I -
<b>DR:</b> The [INAUDIBLE], huh?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  My mom's really into the, my mom speaks German fluently like I speak to you.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> She goes every year.
<b>DR:</b> Is she German?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> Maiden name's [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER], oh yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> My mom's German, my dad's 100, my mom's 100% German, my dad's 100% Lithuanian.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, um, yeah.  Speak Lithuanian?
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Very hard language to learn.  German is easier than Lithuanian.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, sure.
<b>DR:</b> Try Japanese, huh?
<b>PT:</b> No, no.  My daughter tried it.  Oh, [NAME OTHER] told me she wants to learn the guitar.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> And I said, "I'll buy you a guitar."  And I'm going buy her a guitar because she wants to learn how to play.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So this is a good thing.  And I put peroxide in, uh, the shampoo bottles but I keep a bottle of shampoo in my, uh, dresser drawer, because [NAME OTHER] dyed her hair black.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm trying to get it to come to the natural color.
<b>DR:</b> Got you.
<b>PT:</b> Is that devious?
<b>DR:</b> Everyone's got their little ways, little tricks.
<b>PT:</b> Um, is it too devious to put a bug in her room?
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's being devious.
<b>PT:</b> That's being not protecting privacy?
<b>DR:</b> And saying that you're not, uh -
<b>PT:</b> Trusting?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, boy.
<b>DR:</b> Well, anyhow, I want to see you back in a week.  And you'll see [NAME OTHER] today -
<b>PT:</b> Who is she?
<b>DR:</b> At 2:15.  She's a therapist, someone you can talk to.
<b>PT:</b> She's the one with the crew cut?
<b>DR:</b> Well, yes, she's got a crew cut in her back, makes a little bit of a twist.  But she's a nice lady.  Someone you can talk to.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> All right?
<b>PT:</b> Is she a lesbian?
<b>DR:</b> Uh, you would have to ask her.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> I don't think she is.
<b>PT:</b> Probably not.
<b>DR:</b> She's got kids.
<b>PT:</b> She's not.  That's another thing, my daughter keeps telling me she's a lesbian and I'm freaking out about it.
<b>DR:</b> How old is she again?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Maybe well, would you rather have her knocked up, huh?  Just kidding.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't think, it, it's not the point.  The point is, and I explained to her, I go you, you, you cannot say that now.
<b>DR:</b> Right, well, she may have some interest though.  She might say, oh, I like girls.
<b>PT:</b> Well, it's not -
<b>DR:</b> And you go, I like girls, too.
<b>PT:</b> I said, that's fine but that doesn't mean it's in stone that you are.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I says, you're [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You haven't even, even had sex.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> You don't know what this is, uh, whatever.  I says, you've got friends and you're, you're not, you're not.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know, she blames me for this because she caught me and [NAME OTHER] in the act, uh, when she was [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> And so it turned her off to heterosexual sex?
<b>PT:</b> I think it freaked her out really bad.
<b>DR:</b> Well, maybe it freaked her out, but, you know, the reaction is so, what she, would she rather come in and see mom with a girl?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Seen nibbling the giblets or whatever?  I mean is that what she would rather see?
<b>PT:</b> I -
<b>DR:</b> So think about it.  What if she came home, so you can't say it just because she saw, and that was to relieve your guilt.  Okay, okay, they caught you guys in the act.  Okay, fine.  That doesn't make her a lesbian.  Because there is plenty of heterosexual people that have caught their parents in the act, too.  They are heterosexual.  They are probably going, oh, so that's what it's like.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So it all depends what you make of it.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Well I was, I, you know, I tried to tell her, I said, I would support on anything you did.  I, I -
<b>DR:</b> And there are people who have like a gay dad who's got a gay boyfriend.
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> And they catch them in the act and the, they wind up heterosexual.  So it doesn't mean that just because you see someone doing this that you are going to do the same or the opposite.
<b>PT:</b> And this whole idea of, uh, you don't accept me for who I am deal you know, with the dying the hair black and the black nail polish and the black shirt and the black pants and -
<b>DR:</b> What is she trying to express?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> She's being Goth.
<b>PT:</b> I know that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but why?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, ask her what does it mean to her to be Goth?
<b>PT:</b> She's always into this negative, negativity.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But in, in reality when it comes down to it she, she's nice to other people.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I don't understand this.
<b>DR:</b> Well, she can be a sweetheart, she probably is.  And part of it is just the way of sort of feeling that she belongs to something.  But -
<b>PT:</b> The guitar, the guitar thing should work then.
<b>DR:</b> Come with me.  I want to see you back next week, and [NAME OTHER] is going to see you at 2:15.
