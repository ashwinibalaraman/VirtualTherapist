BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so how are you doing?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I’m doing okay. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that’s good to hear. 
<b>PT:</b> I went to a conference over the weekend and I think it’s gonna help me a lot. 
<b>DR:</b> What was that?
<b>PT:</b> It was on depression and it was offered out at [DEIDENTIFIED] by a therapist, I’m not exactly sure what his credentials are, but he was very good. 
<b>DR:</b> Good. What did you get out of it that was helpful?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I need, it’s the kind of thing where you have to go over all of the material, I think, a second time at least because a lot of it is presented in a short period of time, so I just would say that overall, um, I felt a little hopeful again, a little more hopeful again. 
<b>DR:</b> Good. 
<b>PT:</b> Feeling better. His thing is that you may always have to deal with depression, but you can manage it, if not get completely free of it. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> So it’s real practical. Well presented. 
<b>DR:</b> Good. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> And how long was it? Was it both days or -
<b>PT:</b> It was Friday night, um, most of the day on Saturday and then into Sunday morning. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Good. So your mood’s been reasonably - 
<b>PT:</b> Uh, you know, up and down, up and down.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Um, it’s very down when the weather is down like it is now. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> The lower the clouds get, the lower I get generally so, um, yeah, it’s kinda just been okay. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> I’ve been making it, so - 
<b>DR:</b> How’s your anxiety level been?
<b>PT:</b> It’s been pretty bad although on the weekend there was only one time in those three days that I felt so anxious that I had to take medication. 
<b>DR:</b> I’m sorry, you said how many times?
<b>PT:</b> One time. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> One time in three days. That says to me that it helps to be distracted. 
<b>DR:</b> Yes, or, yeah, busy, occupied. Maybe it’s a way of helping cope with the anxiety. 
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>DR:</b> And when you had the anxiety was it something that was there for hours or minutes, all day?
<b>PT:</b> Hours. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> And is it more of a mental kind of anxiety, like worrying about things, just more physical?
<b>PT:</b> It’s really psychological, yeah, I shake, yeah, I’m very tremulous and I don’t feel good, um, don’t think well, don’t - can’t express myself well. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> More poorly than usual, but, you know, it’s not something that I can think, oh, my gosh, this is really making me anxious, it’s not like that, it’s like all of a sudden I feel really anxious and I have a really hard time going back and identifying what triggered it, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, okay and are you getting a racing heart when you get anxious? A rapid heart rate?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes, um, I would say the predominant feature is feeling really tremulous. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, no shortness of breath?
<b>PT:</b> Well, sometimes, you know, sometimes, uh-huh. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Do you get a choking sensation?
<b>PT:</b> No, hmm-um. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and it feels like, I’m sorry go ahead. 
<b>PT:</b> And a lot of times I just don’t - I ache all over. You know, my joints hurt, everything, kinda like fibromyalgia kind of symptoms.
<b>DR:</b> With the anxiety?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just ache all over.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, do you get lightheaded or dizzy?
<b>PT:</b> No. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Do you get numbness or tingling?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well, you know, going back to the dizziness thing, maybe I do, but I attribute it to maybe the medication I’m taking, you know, prophylactically, the low blood pressure medicine. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> The other night I felt that way, I got really upset about something and we had to stand up for a long time in a conference and I’m either gonna scream or I’m gonna pass out. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> So I did feel that lightheadedness thing. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> And then, what was the other question, oh, the choking sensation, not really. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and do you get numbness or tingling anywhere?
<b>PT:</b> I do, but again I think that’s probably the diabetic neuropathy kinda stuff. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> But, yeah, if I - lots of times [PHYSICIAN NAME] I’ll wake up in the morning and my hands will be clenched and I’ll feel diminished, you know, like my hand has gone to sleep. That’s a lot of times and sometimes I have it in other parts of my body, I notice, this is really bizarre, but sometimes my rear end goes to sleep, like just one side does. 
<b>DR:</b> So, where you’ve been laying at night?
<b>PT:</b> Or sitting. Like it will even be like in the evening if we’re watching TV and I’m not feeling very good and I’ll notice, oh, how strange, you know, my left buttocks is halfway asleep, you know?
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Just kinda odd things and twitching, like one side of my face will twitch sometimes. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Um, and, you know, it’s just hard to differentiate like is this the progression of the complications of diabetes or is this related to medication or is this depression or the anxiety?
<b>DR:</b> Right, okay. 
<b>PT:</b> It did come to me the other day, there’s been a word I’ve been trying to come up with that describes how I’m feeling when I’m feeling anxious and even the precursor to that and all I, the word tension is how I feel. Like everything is tense, just tensed up. 
<b>DR:</b> Your muscles?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and that’s why I think sometimes I ache so much is because maybe I’ve been really tensed up for a while and it’s beginning to hurt, you know 
<b>DR:</b> Okay and if you take the Lorazepam, does it help still?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, it helps, yeah, it helps. 
<b>DR:</b> For how long? For hours, all day?
<b>PT:</b> It usually helps for hours. 
<b>DR:</b> And then it wears off and the anxiety comes back or the cycle is broken then?
<b>PT:</b> It kinda breaks the cycle I think. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> A few times I have to take a second, but you know, I only take like 0.25 mg. I break a 0.5 in half 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> And that if it doesn’t completely get rid of it or whatever, I’ll take the other half. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Looking back I don’t think I’ve ever even given you a prescription for that. 
<b>PT:</b> No, it was [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I think who gave it to me and I probably am going to have to get a refill prescription. I have two more refills through the [DATE], I just looked at the bottle.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> But, you know, it’s almost [DATE], so -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> And I still got some Lorazepam, it’s not like I’m desperate for it. 
<b>DR:</b> Do you want me to write you a prescription today, or do you need it yet?
<b>PT:</b> Well, if I have to get it refilled, I’ll need it after the [DATE] so that would be fine, whatever.
<b>DR:</b> I can either write it out for you now or you can let me know when you need it and I can just call it in. 
<b>PT:</b> I’ll let you know. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> And I do have a question before we stop about the medication. 
<b>DR:</b> Sure, go ahead. 
<b>PT:</b> Um, you know, I go to that support group on DBSA, support group for women and they talk sometimes about the medications they’re on and how they’re responding and stuff and there’s one that keeps coming up and I don’t exactly what it is, but I’m kinda open to trying meds again, just because, I just want to get better, you know? I know it can’t be just all medication, but anyway, it’s called Abilify?
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> Is that an antidepressant or what is it? 
<b>DR:</b> Not classically. It’s an antipsychotic mood stabilizer medication. It was originally developed to treat <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> and then after it was out they discovered it also helps with mood swings and bipolar disorder and more recently it was just approved to treat agitation, some people feel less agitated, but some people do get a lifting in their mood with it.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>DR:</b> So it’s not a classic antidepressant, but some people do feel better. Potential side effects can be, some people get really energized with it, where they have a lot of energy and some people can have the opposite effect where they feel kinda sedated with it. 
<b>PT:</b> Hm. 
<b>DR:</b> Um, so it’s an interesting medicine, we’re still learning how to use it best for people. 
<b>PT:</b> Um-hmm. And I understand it’s very, very expensive. 
<b>DR:</b> It is. It’s one of these newer medications, it is.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Um, it’s a good one for bipolar disorder. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and I think a lot of the girls, women are bipolar in that group. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and some people are using it to augment or boost an antidepressant, sometimes that can help. 
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>DR:</b> So it’s something we could consider, um, as long as I have, you know, enough samples to give you, because it’s hundreds of dollars a month. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, did you ever receive from the psychiatrist I saw before, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], did you ever get a record? Because I had asked him two or three times to send them. You know, I feel like I’ve been on so many meds and I don’t mind revisiting some of them
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> But some of the ones that I tried really made me sick, I mean just like jerking and awful like hallucinations and stuff. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. 
<b>PT:</b> I don’t want to go back to those. 
<b>DR:</b> No, I don’t want you to either. 
<b>PT:</b> But, a lot of people seem to be on two meds at the same time and I don’t want to dig my heels in and say absolutely not. So maybe I’ll try contacting him again and have him send the records out. 
<b>DR:</b> That would be great. 
<b>PT:</b> And then we could look because I’ve been on so many meds, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. 
<b>PT:</b> But I don’t remember what the side effects where or the reasons why I stopped them. 
<b>DR:</b> Sure. 
<b>PT:</b> But if you wouldn’t mind working with me on that? 
<b>DR:</b> Absolutely. 
<b>PT:</b> Maybe after I get back from [DEIDENTIFIED], if I ever get there. 
<b>DR:</b> Do you have dates scheduled?
<b>PT:</b> I have an appointment with the retinal specialist on the [DATE], which means I would want to get there maybe just early March or late February and maybe stay for a month. So, late February to the end of March maybe. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Probably I wouldn’t want to start on something new now.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Or different, but, it just feels like maybe I’ve missed something, you know, maybe there’s something that might help a little more. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, we haven’t tried everything, I mean, we’ve tried a lot, but there may be different medicines or different combinations even that we just haven’t tried yet that we could, so -
<b>PT:</b> Now there’s different meds like that work on the Dopamine and then there’s one that works on the Norepinephrine and maybe I need to understand a little bit more what each of those neurotransmitters do. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, it might help and it might not, [PATIENT NAME], and what I mean by that is, you know, the current theories say, or the leading theory says that that’s how they work is by increasing the levels of those neurotransmitters, but there are some competing theories that say that’s not how these medicines work at all. For example, there’s one emerging theory that says that a lot of the antidepressants, even though they do increase levels of those chemicals that doesn’t attribute, or doesn’t account for their antidepressant effect because that increase neurotransmitter levels happens very quickly within hours of taking medicine -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>DR:</b> And yet the antidepressant response lags off sometimes a week or more, and that theory says that it may actually be that these antidepressants also promote new cell growth. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh, wow. Wouldn’t that be good?
<b>DR:</b> It is and there’s evidence to support that theory, that it’s actually triggering new cell growth in the brain and new synapses are forming and that may be how these antidepressants work and that we also see in people that suffer from chronic depression they actually start to lose brain cell volume.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum
<b>DR:</b> And so the theory is that some of those brain cells or the synapses maybe dying off a little bit.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So there are different competing theories and as of yet no one has really proven which theory is correct and it may be a combination of different theories that explain how they work. 
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So really what we usually do is keep trying different medications, or combinations until we find something that works. We can keep doing that. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> So let me ask, are you sleeping okay at night?
<b>PT:</b> No. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, are you having trouble getting to sleep?
<b>PT:</b> No, I usually fall asleep really quickly. Of course, I take a lot of meds at bedtime that have, you know, may cause dizziness, may cause sleepiness kind of drugs for other things.
<b>DR:</b> Okay
<b>PT:</b> So, and I usually take a pain pill now because my left knee is hurting so badly, I’m so petrified that I’m going to have to have knee replacement, but anyway I take it because I’m aching all over, my joints ache and my knee is hurting, so I think that helps me sleep, at least, initially and almost without fail I wake up around three o’clock and other times when I’ve been affected by the depression in my sleep habits I’ve awakened more like five o’clock or five-thirty, so three o’clock was also the time when my blood sugars were going whacko -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> And so I’m beginning to think when I wake up at three o’clock instead of automatically assuming it’s the depression that’s affecting what’s going on, I’m going to be checking my blood sugar every time and I, I did that last - two nights ago and I needed more insulin. It was hyper- 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Glycemia. So, you know, I don’t know if the depression is causing that or if it’s something else, like, it’s blood sugar levels. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, how are your blood sugars doing?
<b>PT:</b> Well, they’re pretty good when I’m really working on it. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> A couple days ago, a couple days ago my stomach starting hurting again, and that’s the other thing I found out, whenever, talk about sugars, whenever I’m not feeling good physically, especially if it’s something that I say, oh this is a diabetic complication, boy that’s when I just take a nosedive, that is a major trigger for me, so the amount of anxiety and depression kind of out of bounds, you know. But I see now more and more how if anything goes wrong, my depression just plummets. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay 
<b>PT:</b> So, anyway, to answer your question which was what?
<b>DR:</b> Well, how your blood sugars have been doing?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that one day two days ago, my stomach was hurting really badly, the gastroparesis kinda pain and I just felt I kept eating things, not in large quantities, but I kept thinking if I just eat something I’m going to feel better, which is antithetical to what I should do, but I ate so much and I’m sure the gastroparesis was a happening thing so my blood sugar started going all out of bounds, but I would say that if I’m really working on it and paying attention to my blood sugars and doing what I know to be appropriate then my blood sugars are pretty good. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, especially compared to two or three weeks ago when I was having those terribly, horribly low blood sugars. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good, I’m glad it’s getting better. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, so [PATIENT NAME] what I hear you saying is that right now what you prefer to do is hold off and not make changes before going to [DEIDENTIFIED]. Is that what you’re thinking?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I think that would be wise. 
<b>DR:</b> I think you’re probably correct. 
<b>PT:</b> I would like to say, yes, give me something and I’ll feel better by the time I go, you know, but I know that’s not realistic. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, and the risk is if you have trouble while you’re out there it’s a little harder to manage it and it sounds like you’re doing okay, not great, but -
<b>PT:</b> I’m doing okay, yeah, I’m doing okay. 
<b>DR:</b> Maybe we can kind of at least hold things steady until you get back and then when you get back maybe we’ll have a chance to maybe make some more adjustments or try some newer things or do a combination, so maybe in the meantime if you can get a hold of your former doctor and get those records that would be terrific. 
<b>PT:</b> I will. 
<b>DR:</b> I mean it will give us some more ideas about what we can try. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
<b>PT:</b> That sounds perfect, yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. 
<b>PT:</b> Sounds perfect. And the other thing I keep thinking, so many of the symptoms that I feel like I have would be typical of somebody with thyroid problems and I know they check my thyroid, it’s always normal, but have you ever heard of anybody that needed more thyroid supplementation or whatever even though their values were within the normal range? 
<b>DR:</b> Yes, in fact -
<b>PT:</b> We may have tried that, I don’t know. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, in psychiatry there’s this condition they call it euthyroid sick, which means even though the lab tests are normal, sometimes people have symptoms and they do tend to benefit from taking some low dose thyroid and, I mean, that’s one of the options and also sometimes the thyroid medication is used just to augment or boost the antidepressants. Looking back, yeah, we did try it a couple years ago. 
<b>PT:</b> Did we? Maybe when we talk again about it maybe we could try that again? 
<b>DR:</b> It’s one of the options we could consider again. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> We tried Cytomel before, we could try Synthroid to see if it makes a difference, T4 instead of T3, um -
<b>PT:</b> Well, boy, you know, I just, boy, I’m just so weary of this, and I don’t want to have said no to something or stopped something prematurely that maybe would have helped.
<b>DR:</b> Okay .
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> Well, why don’t we do this then? Why don’t we hold steady right now and give you a chance to get out to [DEIDENTIFIED], have a good time hopefully, enjoy yourself, get away from the cold, gray skies and see how you feel when you come back. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> And then kind of reattack things anew, looking at new options and what else we can do just to kind of get you feeling better yet. Does that sound okay with you?
<b>PT:</b> That sounds good, uh-huh. 
<b>DR:</b> Anything else today that we didn’t talk about that you wanted to?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, boy, I don’t think so. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Do you want to set up a time now for when you get back or do you want to call me when you get back since you don’t know your dates yet?
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, I’m not going to earlier then probably the last week in February. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay. 
<b>PT:</b> So maybe we could just get together again before?
<b>DR:</b> You bet. Let’s set up a time before you leave. So you’re thinking -
<b>PT:</b> I’m so sorry I forgot that appointment. That is something new that happens that’s good that the conference reinforced. I am volunteering at a [DEIDENTIFIED], we just did it on Monday.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> And it was really good, it was really, really good and I’m so glad, you know, I got that far, to actually be doing it. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> It was good to get out and feel like there’s a purpose and I’m doing something to help someone and get my mind off -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> I need to pay you for that appointment. I just am so sorry. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, let’s figure out when we’re gonna meet next. Um, you think you’re going to leave that week of the [DATE]?
<b>PT:</b> Probably, yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> So maybe the week before that?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. That week some options would be, Friday, [DATE] at eight-thirty, which may be rough for you. 
<b>PT:</b> We have the ladies’ bible study on Friday mornings. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, what about Wednesday, [DATE] at two o’clock. 
<b>PT:</b> Wednesday, [DATE] at two o’clock that sounds excellent. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, let’s do that then. 
<b>PT:</b> Are you planning any getaways?
<b>DR:</b> Not any, well, at spring break we may take a break and go down to [DEIDENTIFIED]. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh, that would be nice. Pray they don’t have abnormal weather down there. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, it’s been strange all over the country, hasn’t it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, even in [DEIDENTIFIED] - even where I’m going to be staying most of the time, [DEIDENTIFIED], it’s like fifteen minutes inland from [DEIDENTIFIED] and my girlfriend, who loves to do yard work lost everything, even her sprinkler system froze. 
<b>DR:</b> I saw them -
<b>PT:</b> That never happens. 
<b>DR:</b> I saw them snow plowing in [DEIDENTIFIED]. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that’s exactly right. She said there was ice all over their roof, they’re in [DEIDENTIFIED]. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> It’s just bizarre. 
<b>DR:</b> It has been very -
<b>PT:</b> So I’m praying it’s not like that when I go. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
