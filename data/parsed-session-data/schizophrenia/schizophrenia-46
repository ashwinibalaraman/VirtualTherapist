BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] you’ve been coming for a while and you and I have established some medications and a treatment plan that has been relatively effective in keeping you out of the hospital.
<b>PT:</b> That’s correct.
<b>DR:</b> Because you’ve had some really significant recurrent depressions and manias.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> When did this all start [PATIENT NAME]? How old were you?
<b>PT:</b> 14.
<b>DR:</b> Age 14.
<b>PT:</b> 14.
<b>DR:</b> And can you recall the specifics of that first episode?
<b>PT:</b> Like a learned helplessness.
<b>DR:</b> And what other symptoms were you having?
<b>PT:</b> Despair, no way out.
<b>DR:</b> Were you suicidal at that time?
<b>PT:</b> I didn’t really understand it, I just, it was like a learned helpless.
<b>DR:</b> Elaborate on it, what do you mean by that?
<b>PT:</b> Like no matter what I could do at that time there wasn’t a sport or an activity or anything that would take, you know, internal pain away. 
<b>DR:</b> The pain was a result of what?
<b>PT:</b> Broken family.
<b>DR:</b> Changes in moods?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, changes in mood, not understanding. Really just not understanding.
<b>DR:</b> Now what changes in mood would you describe?
<b>PT:</b> Inferiority, if that’s the right word.
<b>DR:</b> Describe how you felt.
<b>PT:</b> Lack of purpose.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. So, lacking direction.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> How about your level of functioning, you were a very effective businessman at one time.
<b>PT:</b> I couldn’t concentrate.
<b>DR:</b> Anything else? Were you able to function?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> How were you functioning before this episode? Now this is at age 14 now, you’re doing well considering, that’s a long time ago.
<b>PT:</b> My grandmother used to take me for rides around the country, she, I used to go to work with her at the [DEIDENTIFIED] and you know it was more or less band-aids, taking my mind off, you know, whatever I was going through at the time. I would just, I don’t know how to explain it. She just tried to pick up the pieces.
<b>DR:</b> But what happened that you were hospitalized? Something must have changed rather dramatically.
<b>PT:</b> I would wander off, you know, the neighborhood, just disappear without differentiating time, you know, I would just come back late at night. My mom was livid, so…
<b>DR:</b> Were you confused?
<b>PT:</b> I wouldn’t say I was confused, I just, you know, time could, I could just be gone and not realize it had been 3 hours or 4 hours.
<b>DR:</b> And what would you do during this course of time?
<b>PT:</b> Just walk. You know, go, this was in [DEIDENTIFIED]. I would, you know, take a walk in the, it’s not a park, you know, they have big creeks….
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> You just take a walk and I think just, it’s like being on a feather, you know, just going into my own world.
<b>DR:</b> Being on a feather?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don’t know, just dreaming. 
<b>DR:</b> As if you were kind of lost or disconnected from life?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> The world or what, tell me?
<b>PT:</b> Just imagining, you know, what it would be like if things were okay at the time, if my parents were together.
<b>DR:</b> And all these symptoms were occurring at the time when your parents were divorcing?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I had a step dad at the time, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay but what precipitated the hospitalization, something must have changed?
<b>PT:</b> All of the triggers were in school, you know, the failing…
<b>DR:</b> So you were declining…
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Academically?
<b>PT:</b> Yes. 
<b>DR:</b> You’re a bright guy so something must have changed pretty dramatically for you to start a downward spiral...
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Academically.
<b>PT:</b> It’s hard to remember. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, all right. What actually precipitated a hospitalization?
<b>PT:</b> My mom told me that I was going to be evaluated. She said it would be just a few days, ended up being a month. 
<b>DR:</b> Were you pretty ill in the hospital? Was your mind playing tricks on you?
<b>PT:</b> No, I was just severely depressed.
<b>DR:</b> To the point of not caring whether you lived or died?
<b>PT:</b> Probably, I didn’t want to die.
<b>DR:</b> So you didn’t have any distinct plan, wanting to take your life?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t think anybody ever naturally wants to die.
<b>DR:</b> Well when you’re depressed your judgement is affected.
<b>PT:</b> Right, I’m sure. I don’t think I was, just lost.
<b>DR:</b> And that experience was approximately a month. Was medications employed in your management? 
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Therapy?
<b>PT:</b> Just more observation. I think that’s all they did. 
<b>DR:</b> So they discharged you approximately a month later?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And then what happened? Was there follow up?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No follow up.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Did they give you a diagnosis?
<b>PT:</b> Mild depression.
<b>DR:</b> Mild depression? 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. When did the serious depressions and the marked changes in your personality occur afterwards? You were 14, now you’re what historically?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE]. Wait say that again?
<b>DR:</b> You were 14 then and now you’re moving to the next episode.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Chronologically, okay?
<b>PT:</b> I ended up just making different friends, I think a lot of it was masked through activities, sports, I played lacrosse, I went skiing, I surfed, it was just a big vacation. I think whatever family I had at the time employed all their efforts to, you know, to disguise the truth, but I don’t have an operational definition of what that is. 
<b>DR:</b> I’m not sure what you mean by that.
<b>PT:</b> All right, you know, I never really knew what my mom or what my dad, any of these people, had in mind for me at the time. You know, I didn’t know what their, I didn’t really understand, I was just kept in the dark.
<b>DR:</b> Were you working at that time?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Or in school?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I had started working at age [AGE]
<b>DR:</b> And you maintained gainful employment until what age?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> On and off or pretty steady?
<b>PT:</b> Depended on the circumstances, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. You had a number of hospitalizations and as I recall there was a very serious attempt at your life in the late 90’s. 
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> What did you attempt to do?
<b>PT:</b> Well my mom was in really bad shape, to answer what did I attempt to do, I think I probably took 60 Ambiens and chased it with, what is it, it’s an anti-nausea medicine.
<b>DR:</b> Phenergan, Compazine?
<b>PT:</b> Compazine.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. That was the overdose?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Now I understood you made other attempts?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, let me think. It’s painful to talk about this.
<b>DR:</b> I’m sure it is, especially recounting the potentially lethal methods that you used or attempted to use.
<b>PT:</b> At that time, it was, you know, I was under, I had a wife that had been through a bone marrow transplant, my mother was, I don’t know, I guess she was just progressively dying of cardiac issues, you know…
<b>DR:</b> Cardiac failure?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I carried the burden and I just couldn’t carry it. I just didn’t want to, I couldn’t do it and I don’t know why I was, what I was really striving for, maybe it was just an illusion.
<b>DR:</b> When did things change? When did you swing from the depressed phase into the manic phase, full blown mania? Do you recall?
<b>PT:</b> 2002.
<b>DR:</b> And what was that like? What did you experience?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t remember a whole lot of it. 
<b>DR:</b> Try your best.
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] was shutting down their site, they said you have two weeks to sell your house, move here or there or whatever. I was still in graduate school. I had to finish that and one day I just, I woke up, and I could differentiate time. I couldn’t under-, you know, I didn’t know what day it was.
<b>DR:</b> Is that the time you were hearing voices too?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What kind of voices?
<b>PT:</b> Just torment. Just…
<b>DR:</b> Voices had a gender, were they male, female?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, male.
<b>DR:</b> And they were saying….
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know, a pastor would say it’s evil, you know, something attacking me, signs, I don’t know, I mean it just…
<b>DR:</b> That part’s kind of a blur huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. But the, I don’t know, a lot of things came to the surface that day.My wife was very violent with me and all I could do was hold her hands.
<b>DR:</b> Why was she violent to you?
<b>PT:</b> Because of all the lifestyle, the things I allowed to happen.
<b>DR:</b> I sort of got the impression that you weren’t in control of things, that these experiences you were having were….
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean that was the perception.
<b>DR:</b> Overwhelming to you.
<b>PT:</b> Right. I guess…
<b>DR:</b> Well let’s bring it up to date now. We have you on Lamictal and that’s being titrated upwards with our target range being around 200 mg, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And we discontinued Wellbutrin because…
<b>PT:</b> Too much mania.
<b>DR:</b> It induced mania. Okay. It was quick too wasn’t it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, any of those. Prozac, any of that stuff.
<b>DR:</b> So all the SSRI’s and…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And even the SNRI’s, Wellbutrin and so forth, those all triggered off the more hypomania though, right?
<b>PT:</b> Right, right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay but enough to make some significant changes in your functional status here.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Where are you now? What phase are you in now?
<b>PT:</b> Anxiety, mania. 
<b>DR:</b> You sound awfully depressed to me.
<b>PT:</b> Well I’m trying to control pressured speech, these things, you know, I guess I am. 
<b>DR:</b> Are you swinging back and forth, are you cycling?
<b>PT:</b> If that’s what we call it, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Cycling refers to the changes, sudden changes, the polarity of your feelings.
<b>PT:</b> Well last night I had a bizarre dream that I was being executed. The one time, you know, I’m not a criminal, never have been, in 2002 when I was arrested, you know, she was attacking me and I was holding her hands…
<b>DR:</b> She, your wife?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. And you were arrested?
<b>PT:</b> Right. The police, you know, they put me in an insolation cell, they had weapons drawn pointed at me, playing games, and that didn’t help so I guess this is surfacing now, it comes back. 
<b>DR:</b> Did that experience seem kind of surreal to you?
<b>PT:</b> Sure. It’s somewhere in the long term thought.
<b>DR:</b> All right, sure. What effect does the medications we have you on now, which is predominantly Lamictal and we have you on some Trazodone at night for sleep and I understand that’s a catch 22 type of medication.
<b>PT:</b> Right. If I go above 100 mg, I feel hung over the next day.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> Really. 
<b>DR:</b> And if you’re under 100?
<b>PT:</b> You know, it does the best it can do. I mean it’s…
<b>DR:</b> Does it help with the insomnia?
<b>PT:</b> No, not, maybe 40%.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I wish there was a…
<b>DR:</b> Well, we’re talking about an alternative, you know…
<b>PT:</b> Right, right.
<b>DR:</b> The Mirtazapine, Remeron and we’ll be considering that as a new approach right now and I don’t sense that it would have any problem interfering with the Lamictal as we’re titrating upwards.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and thus far, you’ve had no adverse events, side effects, rash?
<b>PT:</b> From Lamictal?
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no. 
<b>DR:</b> And you feel it definitely helps stabilize your mood?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah as long as I stay at 150 or above.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, you found that empirically to be the…
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Window range for you? 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. All right, that’s consistent with what we find as a result clinically.
<b>PT:</b> Sure, sure.
<b>DR:</b> All right. Well, we’re going to, your vitals have been stable [PATIENT NAME], and you’ve been compliant, you’ve followed up with your treatment and the laboratory indices look quite stable. We still need to work a little bit on the lipid profile for you because of the elevated cholesterol and the triglycerides are up there as well. Your HDL is low and, but your calculated LDL is 77 so you’ve got some several factors that are potentially atherogenic.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And I think the increased diet, increased exercise protocol can help improve those numbers. Now you’re following up with a PCP or haven’t you found one yet?
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] dropped me.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I see sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> And he dropped you for other reasons.
<b>PT:</b> I think he perceives this accidental overdose was intentional, that’s my guess, I don’t know.
<b>DR:</b> With the Klonopin and, or with the Tramadol? What?
<b>PT:</b> I don’t know.
<b>DR:</b> Well that’s what we have on the records [PATIENT NAME].I know this seems confusing to you, but we’re going to try to reduce that confusion and hopefully these changes here will help stabilize the mood further, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I want to thank you very much…
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> For participating in this session, we’ll stop for now.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
