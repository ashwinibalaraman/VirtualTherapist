<i>There is a higher court than courts of
justice and that is the court of con-science.
It supersedes all other
courts.</i>


-MAHATMA GANDHI


My parents' battle reached a climax in June 1962 when my mother and father
spent six days in court. Until the 1980s, it was common practice to
award mothers sole custody of the children while relegating fathers to the
role of a visiting bystander. But my mother's suicide attempt, along with
my father's vigorous opposition to her having custody, forced convention
aside. The fact that my maternal grandmother, Edith Vahey, supported my
father having custody and agreed to continue living at the Quail Street
house reconfirmed the decision.


There are few surviving documents and records to peruse, and my father
has never talked about how the custody battle played out in public. I am
forced to rely on what the newspapers reported, with their lurid headlines
and peculiar observations, to make sense of an outcome I could never understand.
In the newspaper accounts, my father is presented as reasonable
and concerned and hoping for a reconciliation. He is described as generous,

[p. <i>132</i>]

and as protective of the children. My mother is portrayed as hysterical, free-spending,
and unstable, with the question looming of whether she is "fit" to
take care of the children.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_1541');">[note]</a><div id="_note_1541" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. "MD Calls Mrs. Rappaport Fit to Tend Six Children," Record American,

TELLS STORY IN CUSTODY BATTLE,<br />
PILLS FELLED MOTHER OF 6<br />
(<i>RECORD AMERICAN</i>, THURSDAY, JUNE 7, 1962)


... Mrs. Rappaport seeks custody of their six young children.
She testified she had gone through a crisis in the past two years
and "I know now I should not have signed the agreement."


She told the court she has since discovered she had a "blood
deficiency," that she was "desperate, felt horrible," and could not
"stay in the same room with Jerry without bursting into tears."


Mrs. Rappaport testified she "just had to sign that agree
ment because I did not feel I was a fit mother for the children
at the time. I decided the only thing I could do would be to
get away and pull myself together as best I could. The only
reason I signed the agreement was because my mother was
co-custodian.


"The only thing that Jerry wanted was to get me out of the
house. He always said that I would always be their mother."


Mrs. Rappaport, who won a divorce in Alabama in Septem
ber, 1961, on grounds of cruel and abusive treatment after 10
years of marriage to the Boston attorney, told Judge Keville
that since the divorce she has had two doctors, one a psychiatrist
and the other a physician.

[p. <i>133</i>]

"I know now what happened to our marriage and what
drove me away from Jerry," she said. "I've been through a crisis
the past two years. I know now I should not have signed
the agreement."


She could not tell the reason for her illness.


Her testimony was interrupted to permit the court to hear
Dr. William A. Dixon, of Milton, a Beacon St. pediatrician, who
has treated the children since birth.


Dr. Dixon, a witness for Rappaport, testified that the care
and maintenance of the children at the present time, "considering
the upset of the home, is that they are adequately cared
for. Their care at this time is no better and no worse than it
was before the divorce."


On one occasion since the divorce, Mrs. Rappaport testified
she went to the 17-room Rappaport home at Quail St., West
Roxbury, to pick up her son, "Jerry," and the father shoved and
pushed her, so that the children had to step between them. At
one point, she said she feared they were going over the stair
railing.


Under cross-examination by Atty. Jackson Holtz, she testified
that although she was having a visitation problem, at no
time did she ask anyone to arbitrate her visitation rights.


The fact that this story made it into the papers heightened the drama for
spectators, but the problem was that there were kids involved in the media
circus. What is lost in the conflict is the fact that six children needed and
wanted both their parents--even if imperfect.


WIFE WASTED CASH<br />
(<i>RECORD AMERICAN</i>, THURSDAY, JUNE 14, 1962)


Atty. Jerome Rappaport Wednesday pictured his divorced wife,
Nancy Vahey Rappaport, as a woman with a violent temper,

[p. <i>134</i>]

who talked of suicide and spent her divorce settlement money
at a lavish rate.


The prominent politician-attorney testified during the fifth
day of a hearing before Judge Edmund V. Keville in Suffolk
Probate Court on her suit to regain custody of their six children
who had been given to him as part of the Alabama divorce
settlement she received last September.


Rappaport testified that Nancy would storm out of their
home in Quail St., West Roxbury, and when he would coax her
back home, she would throw books, a radio, dinnerware,
glasses or whatever was at hand at him.


... Rappaport said he promised to give Nancy $52,000 as
part of the divorce settlement, part of this sum to be considered
a "loan."


He said she wanted the entire sum at once but for tax purposes
he insisted on paying it in installments. Last month, he
testified, they had a discussion about money. She said she
needed more and admitted she had a little more than $1,000
left out of the $21,000 or $22,000 he had given her to date.


Rappaport said he tried to tell his wife that she was living
beyond her means. He said she took an apartment at $385 a
month and told him she did not intend to look for a job until
after the custody petition was heard.


The lawyer testified he was willing to give her money until
she remarried.


A bruise on Nancy's body, which her physician, Dr. Samuel
Kowal of Beacon St., Br00kline, had testified to seeing, may
have been caused by him striking her, Rappaport admitted.


He said there had been an argument Feb. 2, 1962, when she
was visiting him and when he tried to prevent her from going
to a telephone, she kicked him and he struck her face. He was
not certain where the blow had landed, however.

[p. <i>135</i>]

At the suggestion from Nancy's lawyer that Rappaport had
ordered her to leave the house during a Mother's Day visit with
the children, the lawyer declared that to the contrary he had insisted
that she stay. The visit lasted from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., he
testified. ...


My grandmother was the closing witness, portrayed in the newspaper as
sympathetic and doting. It is not clear to me why my mother would have
thought she had the support of my grandmother before the trial, as the
newspaper described Edith as willing to "share custody of these lovely children
with anyone"--a decided blow to my mother's bid.


GRANNY TELLS LOVE FOR 6 IN CUSTODY ROW<br />
(<i>RECORD AMERICAN</i>,<br />
FRIDAY, JUNE 15, 1962)


... Edith Vahey, trim and active at 65, spoke of the failings of
both her daughter and her son-in-law, Atty. Jerome Rappaport,
during her testimony as the windup witness.


She made it clear that she was neutral as far as they were
concerned but she emphasized that she loved the six children
whose custody she shares with her son-in-law.


(Mrs. Vahey ... spoke with conviction when she was questioned
about her concern for the children who live with her
and Rappaport in their Quail St., West Roxbury, home.) She
was asked if it was true, as maintained in her daughter's petition,
that she no longer wishes to share custody of the children
with her son-in-law.


"I would share custody of these lovely children with anyone,"
she said with finality to the Judge Edmund V. Keville.
Asked if she would assume full custody, she replied, "I certainly
would."

[p. <i>136</i>]

"The children are my life, "she said simply. "I have no outside
interests besides these children. They have my entire at
tention. I have had many arguments with my daughter and
perhaps always will. But I have been happy living in the house
with Jerry, although there have been times when I left when I
did not approve of his visitors."


"The children are the ones that are important."


Mrs. Vahey, who l00ked and played the part of a loving
grandmother, carried a cane into court but explained she does
not need it but carries it for support. ...


Near the end of the testimony, Judge Keville took the six children into his
courtroom and questioned us--Where did <i>we</i> want to live? My older siblings
remember this and I find it confirmed in the court records. Martha
and Jim wanted to live with Dad, Amy and Jerry asked to live with Mama,
and Judy could not decide. At 2 years of age I was spared as being too young
to understand or answer the question. My sister Judy says that her indecisiveness
that day has haunted her--if only she had been able to weigh in
confidently and let the judge know she wanted to live with Mama.


Today, a judge would never invite children under 12 years old into his
chambers for this purpose. People who work with families and children
know that this question is too great a burden for children so young. Nowa
days, court evaluations of children consider each child's developmental history,
what the children have witnessed, the separations and losses each of
them has experienced, the children's reaction to the parental separation,
and their attachment to each parent.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_10831');">[note]</a><div id="_note_10831" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">3. "Practice Parameters for Child Custody Evaluation," <i>Journal of the American
Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry</i> 36, no. 10 (1997): 57-68.</div> But in the 1960s, most judges were
not as knowledgeable about children's psyches as they are now.


At the end of the six-day hearing, Judge Keville considered the testimony
and made his decision awarding joint custody to my father and my grandmother
except for one month in the summer when my mother would have
us. He added the unusual provision that neither Dick nor Barbara Sears was
allowed to be in our presence. We would still live with my father and my

[p. <i>137</i>]

grandmother but if Edith was not able to serve as custodian, my father
would not be able to assume individual custody of the children without a
further hearing. My mother would be allowed to see us Monday through
Friday at Quail Street from 11:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m., and she could visit
our home on the holidays and on the children's birthdays and have us come
to her apartment on "alternate weekends." The probate court documents
also state that "she shall be informed and shall be allowed to visit the children
without limitation whenever they are ill."<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_12094');">[note]</a><div id="_note_12094" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">4. Probate court custody document, June 19, 1962.</div>


Elaine Werby tells me that my mother was devastated by her loss and felt
deeply betrayed by her own mother. The only reason she initially signed
the agreement when she separated from my father was that she trusted her
mother. "I think that she truly thought she was going to get you children
back," Elaine says. "That is what she lived on. ... She counted on it. She was
so sure." Elaine's voice is heavy. She sighs. "She left for self-preservation but
your mother couldn't see it as it seemed to an outsider. No mother deserts
her kids and gets them back."
