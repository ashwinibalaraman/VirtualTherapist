<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, good, so they did, they're now giving them to you at night?
<b>PT:</b> All they said, doc, they took it, they thought it a demand, or something, they said "You're doctor wants you to do it like this."
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It was a uh, a doctor's order, not a demand, but, maybe kind of a little bit, because you were going to sleep too early.

<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> I mean at [DEIDENTIFIED] aren't you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  My stimulus check came in, doctor.
<b>DR:</b> I don't know what that means.
<b>PT:</b> It goes all, as far as I know, goes to all the people on Social Security.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>CG:</b> The stimulus -
<b>DR:</b> Does, did it -
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] thing, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I want one.
<b>CG:</b> I know.
<b>PT:</b> Hey doc, I got that medicine, uh, it's a medicine card from AARP, can you sift anything from that?  The, the -
<b>CG:</b> She, we talked.  She gets paid.  She's fine.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I'm good, I'm fine, that's not, [PATIENT NAME] are you taking other medicines -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Like the over the counter stuff -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> That you weren't supposed to take?
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm not doing that.
<b>DR:</b> You're not doing that.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  And the, have you hit your other doctors up for other medicines?
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> What, has, has there been, have there been medicines changes?
<b>CG:</b> Um, he started him on an anti-inflammatory for his ankle, trying to help with the nerve pain.
<b>DR:</b> What, what was wrong, why do you have nerve pain?
<b>CG:</b> Did you tell her about your ankle?
<b>PT:</b> I want to control that, doc.
<b>DR:</b> What's the nerve pain?
<b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME] you want to tell her about your ankle?
<b>PT:</b> Mom wanted me to show you this.
<b>CG:</b> Well, she doesn't need to see it, just tell her about it.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, what happened?
<b>PT:</b> Vasculitis.
<b>DR:</b> Your uh, by the way, your blood work has done nicely with the Clozaril, um -
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Your, uh, if I remember correctly, everything is okay.  Do you think that you could benefit from taking a vitamin, a multivitamin with iron?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, I take iron.
<b>DR:</b> You, you take a, does he take a vitamin?
<b>PT:</b> Not a vitamin.
<b>CG:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> A vitamin would be good.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, doc.  Well, how about that, [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> But your case manager gets to help you pick it out.
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> One each day.  Just one with some iron in it.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> You want me to do that on my own?
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>CG:</b> We'll go to the store.
<b>DR:</b> She's going to help you.
<b>CG:</b> We'll go to Kroger and we will get you some.
<b>DR:</b> Because I, she's going to make sure you don't pick out a bunch of other stuff.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> You going to give me a script?
<b>CG:</b> You don't need a script.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you don't need a script, um, you can just buy the generics, you know, I think most of the vitamins are pretty much the same.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> Vitamin, just a multivitamin.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> Centrum?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, something like that.  Um, now, sometimes with these medicines, you can feel flat inside even though to us you don't appear that way.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> There's an idea, I don't know if you would benefit from taking the Risperdal Consta shot instead of the pill.  In the event that it could potentially help with you not feeling as sedated, but still allow us to make sure you don't get psychotic.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> Well, I say -
<b>DR:</b> Or -
<b>PT:</b> On the uh -
<b>DR:</b> Or I can, I can give you the higher amount of Clozaril at night and decrease the morning dose again.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And then we leave it there for a while and then decide about the Risperdal Consta shot.
<b>PT:</b> I was just telling [NAME OTHER] I love those shots, doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I know, well [PATIENT NAME] why, okay, I wouldn't give it to you because you love it, um, why are you so um, you are sort of obsessed about medicines.
<b>PT:</b> That's because I'm so dizzy, I couldn't figure it out, doc.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  That Consta shot might actually help that, I don't know.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> The only problem is with a shot, is it always, you always have to pull teeth to get around to get the shot, you know?
<b>DR:</b> No you don't you come here every two weeks and I give it to you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I mean -
<b>PT:</b> I'll take that, doc.
<b>DR:</b> You have, where do you get your medicine?
<b>PT:</b> Kroger.  From the pharmacy at the -
<b>DR:</b> At [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Oh.
<b>CG:</b> He gets his medicines through -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, they would give it to him, they would give you the shot then.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh, they would?
<b>DR:</b> Well, yeah -
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Or I could, I don't know.
<b>CG:</b> They give you all of your other medicines, so [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Um -
<b>PT:</b> Well, I was just telling [NAME OTHER] how I love shots.
<b>CG:</b> You like the medicine.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you do.
<b>PT:</b> Wow, doc, that's interesting.  Are, are you changing the Clozaril?
<b>DR:</b> I'm thinking right now, um, are you, when do you feel lightheaded the most, in the daytime?
<b>PT:</b> In the morning.  It's terrible, doctor.  I can't stand it any longer.
<b>DR:</b> One of the hardest jobs with you has been to keep you on the medicines that work.
<b>PT:</b> Yes ma'am.  Go on, what were you going to say?
<b>DR:</b> Uh, nothing.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> Is there such thing as a Luvox injection?
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't think so.  That and Haldol.  [LAUGHING].  She thinks I'm trying to get her to give me uh, shots of Risperdal and then later on it's going to be -
<b>DR:</b> Is, is -
<b>PT:</b> A shot of something else.
<b>DR:</b> Is he pretty hyper a lot?
<b>CG:</b> He has been hyper a lot lately.
<b>DR:</b> Has he been more hyper lately?
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> Oh, guess what, doc, it's, it's -
<b>DR:</b> What?
<b>PT:</b> Comfortable, it's not, it's not anxiety, it's comfortable.  You know what I'm saying, doc?  It's, it's comfortable.
<b>CG:</b> He's a little more active today than the norm.
<b>DR:</b> So more, more energetic, or -
<b>CG:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Loud, or pressured?
<b>CG:</b> Um -
<b>PT:</b> It's not that sad, doc.
<b>CG:</b> He's, it's been, he's been energetic and jumping topics a lot, but today it's uh, a little more than it usually is.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, and the racing thoughts were what were bothering you -
<b>PT:</b> They slow down and I go into a depression.  I forget easy, doc, can we help, can we work on that?
<b>DR:</b> Um, we can't do everything all at once.
<b>PT:</b> Yes ma'am.
<b>DR:</b> Um.  What's the date today?
<b>PT:</b> [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> I'm ready for a cigarette.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, hold on.  Hang on.
<b>PT:</b> I can feel, I can feel her pen.  That's good work.  I can feel that.
<b>DR:</b> Any suicidal thoughts?
<b>PT:</b> No, huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, let's see here.
<b>PT:</b> Where's your new pictures, doc, look at that one.  Isn't that a beautiful picture?
<b>CG:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Have you been on Depakote before?
<b>PT:</b> Depakote, yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Should I have you on that?
<b>DR:</b> What I'm wondering is if we slow him down a little bit with Depakote, decrease the Risperdal.  See if that allows you to feel less dizzy.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, that's great news, I used to take that stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Or, or decrease the Clozaril a little bit.
<b>PT:</b> Decrease the Risperdal and give me Depakote.  What do you want to do with the uh -
<b>DR:</b> He's not psychotic right now.
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> The uh -
<b>DR:</b> Just a second -
<b>PT:</b> The Clozaril, the Clozaril
<b>DR:</b> Let's decrease, let's decrease the Risperdal to 2 mg twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> That's a very small change.  Let's add, just Depakote 500 mg twice a day, try to slow him down a little bit, and hopefully not allow for the flat.  And let's um, leave the Clozaril for now and then when I see you next time we'll see if, what we need to do if anything.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Because I don't want to change too many things at once.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Oh, my goodness, it's just like the old days.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> In what way, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to start feeling better.
<b>DR:</b> You think?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I hope so.
<b>PT:</b> It's taking a long time but I've been working on it for so long, doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, you really have.  You've been doing, his, his uh, parents are feeling like it's, his treatment is good?
<b>PT:</b> My father's dead.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's right, I'm sorry.  Your mom feels like your treatment is going well?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  She talks to me with a civil tongue, doc.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's not hard to do with you, [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  What are you, are you doing anything with the Clozaril?
<b>DR:</b> No, not today.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Just adding the Depakote and reducing the Risperdal.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I used to like Depakote, and that, and listen to this, you guys.  If I have a flat feeling, that Depakote is the opposite of lithium.  And it's oppos, it's the same thing as the Depakote is the same thing as, it's a dull medicine, it's, what was it, what was the symptom about, the symptom -
<b>CG:</b> What are you talking about?
<b>PT:</b> Depakote.
<b>CG:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> It's the same thing as what, a -
<b>CG:</b> Oh, I don't know.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, my flat feeling.  My flat feeing.  Depakote is the same thing as a flat feeling, it's going to give me energy, quickness, agility -

<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, yeah that's sort of -
<b>PT:</b> They're growing up, huh?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, sure are.
<b>PT:</b> Hey guess what, [NAME OTHER]?
<b>CG:</b> What?
<b>PT:</b> Doctor's used to seeing me sitting in that chair.  [LAUGHING].
<b>CG:</b> Well, we're in opposite chairs today.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Oh, I've got another question for you.
<b>DR:</b> What's that?
<b>PT:</b> Should I stay away from alcohol?
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> No alcohol.
<b>DR:</b> None.
<b>PT:</b> Aw.  She's the doctor.
<b>CG:</b> Told you.  [LAUGHING].
