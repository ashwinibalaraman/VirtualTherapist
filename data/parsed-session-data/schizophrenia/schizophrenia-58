I was twenty-four years old and eighteen months into my first job as
a youth worker when things started to go seriously wrong. Until then
it had seemed to be a great two years with no repetition of any
extreme manic episodes or depressions such as I had experienced as a
student. I do recall vague feelings of unease at some obsessive behaviour
but I was not at all what you could call a reflective person in
those days. Cheered on by my ferocious work rate I was delighted
just to view myself immodestly as a gifted, super-energetic and dedicated
youth worker. Only once was there a warning that something
might be wrong: a colleague took me aside at a party and said that I
should slow down, that I was burning myself out.


And slow down I did when I was struck with pericarditis, an
inflammation of the heart and found myself laid out and helpless in
the medical ward of a general hospital. Once I was over the first
unpleasant couple of days, I settled nicely into the role of model
patient. It was a new, comfortable hospital in which the nursing staff
were attentive and friendly (one nurse used to give us all a kiss before
she went home at night -- things have changed I think!). There was
nothing to it really; I did not have to undergo any unpleasant treatments,
I did not think I was going to die any more and my friends
and work colleagues made a great fuss over me. I just lay back and
waited happily to get better, which in two weeks I did. However, a
second inflammation hit me and I was re-admitted, but now a

It was a hypomanic attack and desperately confusing. I did not
know what was happening; I had no control at all over my behaviour
and suddenly all my nice nurses were hating my guts. Finally a nurse
coming on shift found me relaxing in the hospital's outdoor
fountain. They dried me off and I was fortunate to be seen by a clever
doctor who came and spoke to me for some time. Would I speak to a
colleague of his, a psychiatrist? Obviously, he had a hunch.


I guess that moment when a psychiatrist is first suggested to you
is pretty well branded in your memory. Shrinks are one of those
things that mental cases need -- loonies, head-cases, other people,
that is, not people like me.


The psychiatrist <i>I</i> needed appeared a day later and after a brief
chat hit me with a dose of thioridazine -- turning me into a form upon
which the nursing staff could do their work. This drug, a powerful
anti-psychotic, plus the sleeping pills that appeared, were the start of
a prescription drugs problem which was to complicate my manic
depression wonderfully; but maybe my doctors from that time can be
forgiven for not looking that far ahead. After being discharged from
hospital, my manic depression still undiagnosed, I made the first of
many long visits to The Pits. Confused and unable to return to work I

In this state I got myself up north to my parents’ home in
Aberdeen and after making contact with the psychiatric service
there, was admitted to my second psychiatric hospital in six months.
I had come to the right place; my collection of pills was removed and
within days I was sleeping like a log without them.


Maybe it had something to do with the coal fire that burned at
one end of the ward or the night nurse who looked like somebody's
grandfather, but whatever the chemistry was I was to sleep like this
for the rest of my stay there. I cannot remember how long I was a
patient at this hospital, maybe three months. Negative memories
include milkless custard and the parting consultation I had with a
psychiatrist whose diagnosis was that I was just a ‘bit immature’. I am
sure I was but I rather think that I was a bit manic-depressive too. But
he sent me back to Fife in good shape and although depressions and
manic episodes were to continue to frequently complicate and interrupt
life, it was to be a while before I was to become so ill again. If
any of the doctors I had encountered in those first years suspected I
had manic depression I was unaware of it. The only clear description
I ever got was from my GP: ‘Recurring moderately severe depression.’

But life was sweet again and I was back in town to see what was
new. I found a new job as a residential child care worker, made new
friends, met the woman I was to marry. There was plenty to be
getting on with.
