BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Good Morning. [00:00:11]
CLIENT: Good morning. Well, I think that um, I think that I'm definitely going to try and make the most of my trip to Cincinnati. One because, it sounds really strange but um, I'm going to try and go see some of my doctors while I'm down there. I think I might need to get some steroid injections and, the kind that I probably am going to need is very painful and very um, the doctor that I get it, is, he used to be an athlete himself and therefore has had a lot of [?0:00:43.8] years. And so he does a mixture; he doesn't just take the, the uh stuff right out of the bottle; he mixes in a combination of fast acting and slow acting along with some lidocaine into it. [00:00:54]
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: And then warms it up so it's near body temperature so you don't have the burning. Actually he's had; he used to be an actual athlete so he knows exactly, you have to get it in here and in here, it's you know, it makes all the difference in the world. So, although it's going to be kind of weird for insurance because I'll be out of network sort of, um I think it's totally worth it because one, I won't have to convince anybody to do it. [00:01:26]
THERAPIST: Why will it be out of network?
CLIENT: Um, supposedly it is technically even though it's Blue Cross Blue Shield, it's not in the, like in the immediate bubble of the providers. I don't really understand it, but... [00:01:41]
THERAPIST: Huh, I mean it may be different but I know I've seen people with out of State Blue Cross and there's...
CLIENT: Well if they don't then that's even better, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I haven't had an issue like, if someone comes in on their parent's Blue Cross from somewhere else in the country and I bill it. [00:01:58]
CLIENT: Ok.
THERAPIST: I generally get reimbursed as in network and all of that.
CLIENT: Ok, that would be fantastic, either way, my one doctor is a friend of the family so, I could even potentially uh, you know, work something out for the amount that is not...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So, which is nice, um, so that's good. The bad -I have a lot of cousins I should probably explain. My, both my parents have many, many siblings, and although I'm an only child, I have you know, I'm the first of the grandchildren, and then Sarah is three years behind me, and then I have children, like, there's kids all the way down to being like nine-ish, you know in terms of cousins. And, my youngest cousin Lucas was a preemie, um, and long story short, he's getting a lot of crap at his school that makes me very upset. And I want to spend some time with him and explain to him that he's perfectly normal and also that I feel like I really need to do some sort of social action to fix this because I am so pissed off right now. Um. [00:03:08]
THERAPIST: What's going on?
CLIENT: Well, he made, ok, so he didn't know that it was different. He has, a lot of my family has synconesia, where they have colors and sounds compared to, you know what I mean?
THERAPIST: Synaesthesia?
CLIENT: I totally forget about I'm seeing a therapist. A lot of my family has that. Nothing really strong, just you know the, you know, things like colors and musical notes have like certain color, you know things like that. Well, he made the mistake of saying that. Next thing you know, the school puts him into like, you know, into a focus thing to see if he is schizophrenic. Then like, seriously. Then they start like, the teacher's actually tolerating the kids making fun of him because that's how the whole thing came out. [00:03:47]
THERAPIST: Ok.
CLIENT: I guess he said that, like I guess, numbers have colors related to them or something like that? And, the teacher sort of tolerates the kids telling him he's crazy and things like that, because of that.
THERAPIST: Oh gosh.
CLIENT: And they're like making him, yeah. And so, uh, I am so pissed because first of all that's not, that's not <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>. That's like you know, a well-established thing. I'm surprised that he didn't, that no one even told, I guess he said that no one ever talked about the fact that there's quite a few members of the family that experience this, so it just never came up.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I guess he never thought that it was nothing, that something wasn't normal. [00:04:27]
THRERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But because he was a preemie, he was born two months early, his mom uh, just wanted to have uh one last kid. And so she, she had a child in her forties and so he had a lot of respiratory problems due to, for a number of weeks. And so he has a number of health problems anyways, he's overcome most of them.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: And now he has to deal with the fact that like, he you know, like everybody thinks he's a crazy kid. Like, even the teachers don't understand that that's not, they're not educated enough to know that that actually isn't like you know, crazy.
THERAPIST: Right. It's an idiosyncratic cognitive thing that as far as I know isn't associated with any kind of psychopathology at all. [00:05:08]
CLIENT: No. And I just hope that even if it was linked with it, I have many members of my family that experienced it that you know, still do, that do not have any sort of any other mental health issues you know?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So, I don't understand and so, I want to try and help my aunt and basically, first I'll spend some time with Lucas to explain it's a completely normal thing, you know, completely normal. Spend time with him because he, he really has sort of like a hero worship for myself and my husband. Um, and so you know, hearing it from us that it's completely normal is going to carry a little more than other people.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And then the other thing is that I really want to push to get him out of that school district because having been around and seeing what happens with these school districts that are smaller, you can't ever really outlive anything once a teacher's decided something.
THERAPIST: Yup.
CLIENT: And so I'm gonna try and see what we can do to maybe get him into a private school or something. His mom's been, she's overwhelmed, especially since they told her, they told her that her child might be schizophrenic. [00:06:14]
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's nuts.
CLIENT: Yeah. And so, I mean, yes that school district, she specifically lives further out into the country, not that much, but enough you know it's the outer reach of the suburbs because she wanted to, she owns horses, she wanted her kids to be able to have, you know, to be able to run around and do things without having too many streets nearby. She did it so she could have a better life for her children, and on top of it though, the education that her son is getting is substandard because she wanted them to have a better life. [00:06:46]
I don't know if the education is substandard, but at least the education of the teachers is substandard in terms of that, you know and I just, everything I've heard about what happened in this incident has made me so upset, that um, because I would never want this kid to be shamed into thinking that, you know, that there's something wrong with him in, you know, his head. You know? Um, and he just (pause-inhale) it just really upsets me, so I want to try to get him involved in you know, a school that's gonna be different for that. [00:07:23]
Um, there is now, um, like (inaudible at 00:07:28) schools, things like that where they celebrate differences too, so I think that that might be better.
THERAPIST: Do you think this pushes a particular button for you? I mean...
CLIENT: Yes, very much so. I have seen this happen to people very close to me in my life. For me, I had it happen, but I was like, "Yeah, I know more than you do". Which sounds really stupid, but I remember being about eight or nine or whatever, and sitting in class and having a teacher say something like, "and the reason why it's colder in winter is because you're further away from the sun". And I'm like, "No it's not it's the stupid angle that you're at". [00:08:04]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And their like, oh well it's a very complicated program and little kids can't understand that. So, I remember just thinking to myself, "Wow, this teacher obviously doesn't, is not willing to open up their mind to other things". Not just that I'm right all the time, but, is unwilling to do that, so I was comfortable enough.
THERAPIST: What was the criticism you got? In other words like, I get that you consoled yourself kind of...
CLIENT: Right. I was criticized that that the program was obviously too hard for me to understand and therefore, I've gotten it wrong. [00:08:41]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: But my very very closest friend Bryant, um, all through school got tremendous, tremendously beaten up. He got, like, he was bullied so badly, and...
THERAPIST: For what?
CLIENT: Um, well, a couple of things. The major thing really was the fact that he had um, he was very very, his parents were psychiatrists so they actually picked up on this early. He, he's um, bipolar and they picked it up super early in his life and he was medicated for it. And, since the school didn't really understand what bipolar meant back in the early eighties, but, and he had, everyone knew he had to go to the nurses office x amount of times a day to get pills taken. [00:09:24]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And that was very odd back then. And so, it sort of leaked through that that was what it was and then next thing you know, like, people are treating him like he has a split personality. You know what I mean, like this whole he had to live this down? And, it, it, yes it was people didn't really understand that kind of thing, but then they just like, the teachers let people pick on him. They picked on him a lot. I mean they, he was poisoned more or less at one point. Some kid gave him stuff that had Ex-Lax in it, that kind of stuff, and so I saw a lot of horrifying things happen to him. [00:09:57]
And, I remember that basically in high school, he probably only attended maybe half of the days of high school. Probably in my heart, it officially was due to other things but I knew that part of the reason he didn't go is because he couldn't stand the, the criticism. And the fact that you know, that to me just struck such a nerve since you know, we've, it's the closest person in my life I've ever had to being a brother. We've often said we were fraternal twins, we're you know, separated by three months. Because, we've known each other since toddlers. [00:10:32]
So that's something that I mean, I, bothered me all of my life watching that happen. Where I felt confident enough to shrug a lot of it off. Yeah I knew that, I imagine that, I am always a person, personally I will step up for somebody else well before I step up for myself usually. [00:10:48]
THERAPIST: I....
CLIENT: You've gotten that part. Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: But I imagine you felt and in some ways you felt and were seen as different as well.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean like....
CLIENT: But in my own way I felt like it was awesome.
THERAPIST: You know I get it, like,
CLIENT: I mean, yes I had quite a bit of insecurity towards it but I don't think I ever felt like I was crazy, you know?
THERAPIST: Well that's good.
CLIENT: So, I had a brief period of time in my life where, um, the school district did, they were very confused because they weren't informed of, when my grandfather passed away I was very upset and very withdrawn. They did not know this happened, and so I went and basically sort of zoned out for a while and so they were very confused. And I had the experience of trying to talk to like school counselors and things like that, and realizing "Wow you guys aren't with the program, you guys don't actually know anything about this". [00:11:45]
But that was enough of a big shock to the system for me that I don't think I'd want anybody else to have to go through that either, you know? So, but it's just (pause) I'm super protective about that you know, and it bothers me that, it bothers me that, so deeply that somebody told my little cousin that he may have a very serious medical condition that you know, that can never be cured. You know? I mean whose business was that to tell that to him at the school, when it wasn't even right you know? [00:12:27]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's unconscionable.
CLIENT: You know and (pause) telling him that he may eventually start hearing voices and; that's very freaking scary. Very scary.
THERAPIST: Absolutely.
CLIENT: And I just, something about it really just got me I mean, it, it, I don't think it's about a personal, physical personal experience as much as the fact that I can imagine it happening to me. I can see it, you know it didn't happen but I can see it happening to me and being terrified you know?
THERAPIST: Especially like, (pause) somebody telling him that something is terribly wrong forever. [00:13:18]
CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) Yeah. I mean plus hearing things like that's the reason that most of the people that are crazy in the streets, that's what is wrong with them? I mean I don't know how much was given to him like, directly by school counselors or what, but they had no right to do that. It's not even the right profile of an age for that kind of thing, doesn't that normally happen around puberty or so?
THERAPIST: Uh, it typically happens, uh, like, for men, in their late adolescence.
CLIENT: Late adolescence, early twenties, yeah, so it's not even, it's not even like fits the profile of this kind of thing you know? [00:14:00]
THERAPIST: Right. There are, I haven't followed this, I mean there are diagnoses of like childhood psychosis and things like that, but um, possibly a childhood <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> but I don't even know it must be pretty rare.
CLIENT: I find it hard to believe that a school district of less than a thousand children between ten and twelve in rural Ohio is on the cusp of child psychiatry, you know journals?
[laughter]
CLIENT: You know what I mean? I mean it could be that some of these people are being asked to do peer reviews and things like that but I kind of doubt it.
THERAPIST: They've never heard of synaesthesia.
CLIENT: Yeah. I've heard of it, I've just never heard it pronounced, because I've only read about it you know?
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Oh my God. You know? And I just, getting to be so upset about that thing.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But I think that the reason why I want to get him out of that school, the reason that I felt so confident about being ok and being different and having my own world is partially the way I grew up, but partially because I did go to a, up through you know, a certain age, I went through Montessori. And so, that was you know, that was especially celebrated, not just on my part, but everybody was different. [00:15:10]
THERAPIST: Also like, your parents are pretty awesome about a lot of this, like, they were really so excited about you and thought you, you know, other things were so wonderful that like, you know, that helped a lot too.
CLIENT: And on top of that, I mean you know, people always used to ask me if it was sad and lonely being an only child, you know, honestly they always let me believe that you know, that they just felt like I was enough. That everything was great. Occasionally when I was being rotten, um, it was because I was more of a handful because I would be like, well let's break this up into actual philigosic logistic logic here. So you said, this argument; but the way that really pisses off my parents when that came out of me at like twelve. [00:15:57]
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: Like saying ok, this seems like a fallacy here, I said this and then this and then you came to this conclusion. (pause) But um, but for the most part yeah. I mean I always, I felt very confident in who I am. Maybe a little bit overconfident in certain situations which made for awkward situations but for the most part yes, and I just feel so much like, maybe he needs that to get himself past this hump. Maybe for a year or two even, just to see that, you know, that that's pretty cool. You know, whatever it is that you like to do is pretty cool. And so....
And I don't think that's trendy anymore, Montessori school. I think it's more like a, it's more that they are, you know, like it's an older thing.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: At least in Cincinnati I think it's more common. So, which is not the same thing but a similar concept of you know, making children confident in themselves. So, we'll see.
But I just, I don't know why, everything about it makes me... I've never been so angry about something, not ever but, I mean it's been years since I've gotten so upset about hearing about something. It's made me very very upset, I mean, there's, there's no, I can't even think of anything that would get me, even potential like situations, that would get me more upset you know. So, I don't, like I said, it's got me very very riled up so.... And, I just, I feel like my parents also had a trouble navigating that the school system, not the same one but, like not always, not understanding how to handle things also. Luckily they were, most of it was pretty much um, uh, harmless in terms of not really understanding it for the most part. But, I've seen it go much worse... [00:17:55]
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: And therefore, I really feel like I want to help my aunt out and say, "You know what, if this is starting now, and he already had trouble before. That, you know, let's cut the losses and you know, I'll help you find something better".
She's, she doesn't have a problem with me saying that kind of stuff too, she really respects my opinion. But you know, having been in, you know, all of them have been in two private schools themselves, and they were told that these public schools are so great for kids now and how terrible it is to put kids through like the Catholic school system or whatever. Well, there is, there are differences between religious schools and you know public schools or something in the middle that is you know, secular per se, but has really, you know has a lot of value. I don't think she really realizes that there is something. So. (large pause) [00:18:51]
Not that I think there's anything wrong with Catholic schools either myself. I would have loved to have gone to a private school.
THERAPIST: You would have?
CLIENT: Yeah, I think I would have. From the people that I know that went to ones, there are certain things about the rigidity that I think I would have really rejoiced in. So. (pause) You know, my husband went to a religious school and he adores, he adored it, and um, he still has very strong friends for life whereas I have like maybe four people that I want to even ever see again, from my high school? And um, you know the kinds of bonds that he made were in, and he's not the only person that has told me about this. That they had, you know, it sounds like it's a pretty great opportunity. And my experience in private schools, and the Montessori school system, I do want to see those people that I knew. And I did have you know, some of my teachers at my wedding and things like that. So, yeah I think it is you know, a good, it would have been a good fit but at the time it wasn't you know, in vogue to put your kids in private school I guess. You're supposed to trust in the public school system. And it was a very exceptionally good school, but still. You know? A lot of that was for regret. [00:20:13]
(inhale) But, so that's really big for me. I'm going to try and make sure while I'm down there I get a lot of stuff going cuz I just feel like, part of it is getting myself put to right, but part of it is helping out with other things.
THERAPIST: When are you going to go?
CLIENT: Um, it's not this week, I think it's next week? It's the same week that the carnival is so, it's I have to make sure, hold on, because I need to tell you when I'm not going to be here. Although they have a homecoming, a carnival is a much bigger deal there.
THERAPIST: I see, uh huh.
CLIENT: Well mostly because we don't cover, I mean there's a football team supposedly but nobody really pays attention to it. It's gonna be between uh, late night on the 17<sup>th</sup> through the 22<sup>nd</sup>, so I guess I will not be in on the 19<sup>th</sup>.
THERAPIST: Ok. But the 17<sup>th</sup> is ok?
CLIENT: Yeah, we're going to do middle of the night driving because of uh, traffic. So. But yeah that way we can also you know, try and talk to people we know, reconnect, I've already gotten my husband to talk with some of the people who advised him both formally and informally already through the years already. So, I guess I'll try to do some more of that, which is good. I uh, it's only taken two years to get do this, and I admit it's worth it. So.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Which is good, this is really good, but you know, I just, I need to, like a recheck at home now you know, I feel a little out of my element a lot. Um, I don't have much like immediate family but the ones I do have I guess are dead so. (pause) And um, it's very weird because it's not that far away, and the cultures are not that different but I think the fact is, is that there's, there's a slight enough difference. Unlike Kentucky where I knew it was going to be very different, um, you know. Austria I knew was going to be very different you know, that kind of thing. But this was very, this is close enough that the differences, it's very easy to overlook them and then all the sudden get caught up in this, "Oh my God, this is a problem", kind of thing. So, um, which, you know can be frustrating. So. And um, so it will just be nice to go home for a little bit.
THERAPIST: Yeah, which differences do you have in mind?
CLIENT: I'm sorry?
THERAPIST: Which differences do you have in mind?
CLIENT: Oh gosh, um you mean differences?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: In terms of? Oh God. (long pause), I'm trying to think of things right now. (longer pause) I can't think of anything off the top of my head right now, but there's definitely... I think the passive-aggressive note concept instead of knocking at somebody's door to tell them that you have a problem is kind of weird you know. Um, apparently very common though. Uh, I don't know. The concept in general of reporting somebody for something instead of (inaudible at 00:23:48) with them like face to face.
THERAPIST: I see, yeah.
CLIENT: I think is very strange to me. You know? Um, like instead of like if you're sidewalk isn't shoveled in the winter, calling the, calling you know Dartmouth to report you for not having a shoveled sidewalk instead of knocking on the door, asking you know. Doing it, maybe it's a little bit passive aggressive, saying, "Hey is anybody injured, I noticed you didn't shovel your sidewalk" or something like that.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Sometimes it actually is that somebody hasn't been able to do it. You know? It's not like they don't know where you live cuz they're reporting your house, that kind of stuff. I don't know, that kind of gets me. Um, there's a lot of things, I just can't think of any, there's a lot of things that are much more important that I cannot think of off the top of my head.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: But there's just little differences that um, surprises me, um, that kind of thing. (long pause) The um, (pause) yeah, so, I mean that's, every city does this, but when it's a bigger, when things look different and they seem completely different then it's easier to frame yourself and be braced and notice the differences than, I mean the architecture is remarkably similar, like the industry that you know, that everything about little things are so similar that when the differences happen you don't, they hit you a lot, you don't look at the differences you know?
THERAPIST: Yeah yeah yeah.
CLIENT: You know? So maybe that's it, I don't know. Um, I noticed that the, the education level as you spread out to the suburbs is very different in this town. As opposed to there is, there, although once you get like in the city like of Hanover, big city things like that, you get a lot of people that are very educated. But it seems to be like, it bleeds out really fast. And, up here like in terms of people being not as worldly or not as educated as much?
THERAPIST: Maybe it depends a lot on which suburb?
CLIENT: Yeah, well then you lead up to the city like up to the North, like once you start to get to like the (inaudible at 00:26:13) but once you get past Concord. I teach a lot of these people, so, as you get up to like that area there, it seems like I'm getting a lot less people who are...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And when I say education, I'm not talking about degrees; I'm talking about just being knowledgeable about things.
THERAPIST: I see, worldly in a way.
CLIENT: Yeah, not big things, but just like, um, things that they, I would think that they would know that they do not know, so. Um, and I don't mean to, to make anybody feel bad about it, um, I do my best to be as nice as possible, but every once in a while I guess, um, you know, I get caught up in it. So, um, but yeah it seems to be that although there isn't as much of it, intellectual horsepower in Cincinnati, though right around the area where all the Universities are it definitely is. It seems that there is a lot more, um, it, and maybe like I said, I'm only sampling from the North up, cuz that's where I work. And from the South down it may be different, but it seems like that there's more basic understanding and knowledge about the world. You know?
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: I don't know, so. I, I, and I guess I could just be biased you know? I lived in a couple of cities where it was even worse than that you know? But I am to this day, completely befuddled that I had to have an argument with somebody over where Denmark just happens to reside. Yeah. I really didn't know why in the world that we needed to look for Denmark on a map, but I'm like, "it's the North Sea, it's much further down". They're like "no, no no, it's above Sweden". No, it's not. You know. That kind of thing. And yes, these are just words, these are just facts, but you don't need to know them but I'm still a little bit shocked about that one, so. [00:28:15]
But, so that's pretty much the big thing, um for me right now, is just going home for a little bit. It's funny because although Mike was raised in, mostly in Kentucky, a little bit in Arizona, he spent more of his adult life outside of his home town now. You know? Um, so that Cincinnati is home for him too. So, um, it's uh, so he kind of misses it too. When we get to Kentucky like, there's all kinds of quirky things that drive him crazy too. So, it's not like it drives you crazy but um, they actually have signs on any store that has, that sells saccharin, on the door they have to have a big sign on the door that they sell saccharin and that saccharin can kill you. This is fantastic, because this is a state that allows concealed carry in all places.
THERAPIST: chuckle.
CLIENT: And bullets will kill you.
(laughter)
THERAPIST: Saccharin is a...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, so there's, it, it, you know, like I said it's, and those kind of things that I thought was completely bizarre and was living down there and he's now gotten to the point where he thinks it's kind of strange too, so. (pause) There's combination like gas stations and liquor stores, that kind of stuff. (whispering) I have no idea why. (normal voice) But um, so, it's you know, and you know, even with that I mean I really, I'm trying real hard to be a good sport about living here because I think that actually I could have a better time than I am, I'm just so grumpy. Everything around this move made me grumpy that just in general I just had a bad, a sour attitude about it, that I'm not having as much fun as I could you know, about the whole thing. So, I just sort of been clinging onto that anger and that like, everything that was going wrong around that period of time that I haven't...
THERAPIST: Well, (pause) your health has also been crap a lot of the time.
CLIENT: That's probably the reason why, yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: That can really do wonders for the attitude in my experience, so.
CLIENT: (inhale) It doesn't. You know it's, it's my health, it's you know a very depressed husband which is always fabulous to have to deal with. Um, you know, I mean having a long commute actually lends itself to not knowing the city very well. Because when I get home I want to go to sleep.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know, that kind of thing. But um, it, it's weird that there are cities that I know much better than this one that I have never officially lived in you know? Um, one of the people that I work with is going to do (inaudible at 00:31:45) Edinburgh School of Economics. By the way, I mean, I am so like, and he's been very sweet about it, I am so peripherally getting excited for you, that I, it's about as good as if I were going myself.
I'm like ok, so, you're an employee and like, you probably want to live in the area of zip codes of SW1 or SW2, this and it's Southwest one and, I'm telling him all about where he wants to do this and I'm super happy for him, I barely know this guy, but I'm getting to know him better. But it sounds silly but I'm just like, it's nice to be able to get somebody else's' excitement and enjoy it and just be happy for them. Because I know Edinburgh very well.
THERAPIST: Mmhmm... you spent awhile there for work didn't you?
CLIENT: Um, not, I lived there a couple of times for work, actually I was in Austria. I was officially a resident of Austria for almost a year. What they did was, um, back when I worked in [anonymous] uh, (inaudible at 00:32:39) was in Austria which sounds really glamorous. Not so glamorous. Um, I was in Edinburgh quite a bit for Microsoft, but the number of days is maybe in ten. [00:32:52]
When I grew up as a kid I went to Edinburgh a lot with my family. So I know it really really well. But um, when I was in Austria, instead of having you deal with the work permit thing, they just sent me home every three weeks. So I never really had to worry about being a resident, I just had a business trip that you know, lasted for three weeks. All the time. So. So, it, when I say I lived in Austria, most people, was not officially lived there but come on, three weeks of every month I spent in Austria. So. So, like I know that place pretty well, like right around Vienna and a couple other places, but like I really don't know my, like, I don't think I've ever been further south than, no I've been to IKEA, so I've actually been further south than the south end but only once and that's it. And, I really don't have an interest in it. You know? I have exactly zero interested related to learning much about the area around here. And, (pause) I don't know if I should try to force myself to do it or not, you know? I know that the, the likelihood of trying to get a physician in the city is probably pretty low. Uh, it's pretty uncommon to, to stay at the same University that you do your post doc in, so. Um, though it could I mean, technically could go to one of the other ones. But I just kind of see it as a temporary place of living. Just like you know, you know, I, and normally when I'm in a temporary place it doesn't bother me that much. I knew I wasn't going to be living in Lexington, Kentucky very long or, actually I really liked living in Baltimore. But, yeah, so. But the only person in the world that did the commute from the city into the suburbs for the job in DC, so. I like cities, I don't like suburbs. So, um, so I don't know. [00:35:03]
But, I'm just looking forward to the next place at this point. Maybe I'm giving unfair, like feeling towards it, but you know what, I can't (pause) I can't make myself feel bad about the fact that I don't like this city. Yeah, I like to visit and I think I'd be great and happy with it on vacations and like coming for conferences and stuff, but I just you know? But I'm just not really feeling it, you know? That could change I understand but just not right now. So, and, just... `
THERAPIST: Yeah, I would imagine that kind of thing if like, I mean like for whatever reason you don't like it and that's kind of how it is. [00:35:03]
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't even like, it's not like I have to be closer to home, it doesn't bother me. I mean it does bother me but I've lived far away from home before, like across the ocean away from home, so it's not a big deal. It's a big deal, but it's not the hang-up. [00:36:10]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It's that, just something maybe with the wrong timing or whatever, but I decided I didn't like it. The first impression, you know I've been here before, the first impression went off on a bad note because of everything else going on and I've decided that I'm stuck in my ways. I'm not (pause) and I think that just because I know, I'm don't think I'm going to be here permanently I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing that I'm stuck in my ways you know? It's (long pause) [00:36:36]
I feel guilty talking about how much I really don't like it here.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you do.
CLIENT: Well I am constantly, people are like asking me, like, how are you getting along, have you done this, isn't this great? I just have to lie to them and tell them yes, this is a lovely place. Um, I mean what else am I supposed to say with people that I barely know, you know? If you're having an awful day and you run into someone that you don't know very well and they ask you how you are, you never say. If somebody very close to you, you can tell them you're having a rotten day, but somebody you barely know? You never tell them the truth. [00:37:10]
THERAPIST: Do you feel bad saying it to me?
CLIENT: About Boston?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: No, I don't think you're from here are you?
THERAPIST: Um, sort of yes and no. I mean it, uh.
CLIENT: I didn't really think about it.
THERAPIST: Yeah, no it doesn't bother me, I didn't know if that was the...
CLIENT: No, no no. It's the little ladies who are asking me how I'm settling in more.
THERAPIST: I see, I got you. Sort of like, more (inaudible [00:37:37])
CLIENT: Or like my boss is taking me out on Sunday so, um, which I'm a little nervous about. She's decided that I'm going to love it, I don't know anything about the place and why I have to go research it. What exactly about it I'm supposed to love, but I guess so yeah.
So, I mean, I think I've told you I have a lot of bosses. And I'm mystified that one of my bosses adores me because we barely know each other, but, um, (pause) I think it's kind of nice that she's you know, going out of her way to do stuff with me, so. Yeah, she's the, she's the head of all the bosses, so. [00:38:18]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So we don't have much interaction, but she's been very nice to me so...
THERAPIST: How nice. Is it just the two of you going?
CLIENT: I think so, we may go with somebody else that I kind of know, I think. But, we've gone to wine tasting things before and you know, which is kind of nice, but it still, she, I'd feel really guilty about hating it here; because she, she left and came back because she was in love with this place, so. And so, uh, she'd lived in, you know, in the middle of like mid-town NYC. She's lived in like, Shanghai, she's been a lot of places and she came back here so I feel really guilty about not liking it, so.
It's also like if this place is supposed to be super great and I'm gonna love it, I'm kind of worried that, what if I don't like it you know? You know so? But, it's nice, it's nice. It's weird to have most of my female friends have been very intellectual in my life, whether or not they've been in the same discipline as mine, but they were intellectual and, um, so it's weird to have somebody approach me and really want to be good friends with me who has not just actual academic credentials, because I've had friends who didn't really spend a whole lot of time in school but just had pursuits of their own, that were, you know of that nature. She doesn't, I mean it's just not her thing at all. Um, but pursuing our friendship is kind of, it's awkward for me. I'm like, what, why do you want to be my friend (laughter). What are we gonna talk about? I have no idea. You come from a family of eight; I am a family of just me you know. So, it's gonna be kind of weird but, you know. [00:40:07]
THERAPIST: It sounds nice though.
CLIENT: Yeah, it sounds nice. So, (pause) it's (pause) always like, been strange though because when it's a boss that's doing this, is uh, you know, it's trying to figure out where compartmentalization is? It was harder with the wine tasting. Because it's very easy to when you go to a wine tasting to accidently get tipsy. So that was a lot more stressful.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: But this one, I don't think so much. But, cuz, you know.
THERAPIST: You mean kind of figuring out where the boundaries are, and what....
CLIENT: The boundaries are, and what you can't talk about and can talk about that kind of thing. She was the person that sat me down and told me that no matter how worried that, because we were discussing where my husband could end up being. And, although um, although Kansas City is not actually a place that we would actually end up being, she sat me down and said, "No matter how great the offer is, if it's in a place like Kansas City, you have to make sure to turn it down because you're never gonna live, you'll never be able to deal with it". So, it was kind of interesting that she had that insight not knowing me that well.
THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible at 00:41:15)
CLIENT: Yeah, so, I like the city, I've never been a person that wants to go out in the countryside for more than an afternoon. And I lived in a quasi-suburb, but it was close enough that it was, they called it the T in Cincinnati too, it was a T-ride in, so it was you know, not very far at all. So, and um, you know, I mean Baltimore is about, is, like, that was possibly the point where I realized I needed to live in cities, is because the fact that I love, just being able to get up and being in the middle of everything. You know, which is nice.
THERAPIST: We have to stop for now.
