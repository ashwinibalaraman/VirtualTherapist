INTRODUCTION:
The following transcripts were provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.  
Two psychotherapy sessions follow that feature the work of Drs. Richard Felder and Carl Rogers.  Each has a distinct approach to this patient, Loretta, a hospitalized woman with <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span>. Following the two sessions is a discussion featuring these therapists as well as Dr. Albert Ellis and other (unknown) participants.  In the discussion, several participants refer to a session that Dr. Ellis did with Loretta the day before Drs. Rogers' and Felder's sessions.  Unfortunately, that interview is not among the ones on the AAP tapes that were transcribed. Nevertheless, it is a lively discussion session that addresses the pros/cons of these therapists' approaches. 
ABOUT THE THERAPISTS:
Albert Ellis, Ph.D., was born in Pittsburgh in 1913. He received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in clinical psychology from Columbia University, and held many important psychological positions, including chief psychologist of the State of New Jersey and adjunct professorships at Rutgers and other universities. He is the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), the first of the now popular Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT).
In 1959 he established the Albert Ellis Institute, a non-profit organization whose mission was to promote Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) as a comprehensive educative and preventative theory. Albert Ellis died on July 24, 2007.
Richard Felder, MD graduated from Emory University School of Medicine in 1944, served as a US Army physician in Germany and practiced internal medicine before going into psychiatry. With this medical background, Dr. Felder viewed clients' mental health along with their physical well-being and by linking the two, advanced a more holistic approach to healing. 
Dr. Felder was president of the American Academy of Psychotherapists and a founder of the Atlanta Psychiatric Clinic. He died in May, 2008.
Carl Rogers, PhD. (1902-1987) was one of America's most prominent psychologists. Rather than identifying persons as "sick" or mainly flawed from childhood experiences as the Freudians did, Rogers was interested in how he and other mental health professionals could recognize the strength in people. 
Rogers is the acknowledged creator of the "client-centered" approach to psychotherapy. It has also been called "person-centered therapy." His studies resulted in the creation of several totally new mental health therapy techniques. Client-centered therapy is based on the principle of talking therapy and is a non-directive approach. The basic elements involve the therapist creating a supportive, non-judgmental atmosphere in which the client is encouraged to reach his or her full potential. The therapist encourages the patient to express his or her feelings and does not suggest how the person might wish to change. By listening and then repeating back what the patient reveals, the therapist helps them to explore and understand their feelings for themselves. In client-centered therapy the therapist's role is mainly to act as a facilitator and to provide a comfortable environment and NOT to direct therapy outcomes.
Called "the quiet revolutionary," Rogers also accomplished what no mental health professional had done before. His 1942 innovation of the tape-recording of psychotherapeutic interviews was far ahead of its time. Many of his taped interviews were donated to the American Academy of Psychotherapists' tape library, and those tapes have now been transcribed for this database.
SESSION #1 with DR. RICHARD FELDER
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
MODERATOR: Loretta, this is Dr. Felder. 
DR. FELDER: Hi.
LORETTA: How are you?
DR. FELDER: You want to sit over here. Did you know we were going to see you again today?
LORETTA: No, I just thought it was going to be one doctor. 
DR. FELDER: You want him back?
LORETTA: Well, I don't care. (inaudible) with me.
DR. FELDER: Okay. You knew you were coming back today, but you thought it would be the same doctor?
LORETTA: No. I thought it was going to be just one doctor.
DR. FELDER: Just one, one time? Yesterday?
LORETTA: I didn't know about today. I mean I knew I was going to talk to the doctor, but I didn't know who it would be though.
DR. FELDER: Oh. Well I was in the group yesterday.
LORETTA: (inaudible) 
DR. FELDER: And I wanted to start today by telling you my feelings about yesterday. I came away from it with a headache.
LORETTA: I had a headache today. So. (inaudible). I tried to read a book and I couldn't.
DR. FELDER: And I had two main feelings about yesterday. One of them is a little bit complicated. I felt you entertained this and we enjoyed it, but that that was kind of a dirty trick on you as far as to enjoy your entertaining.
LORETTA: I'm glad you were entertained. 
DR. FELDER: The second feeling I had, and I'd like to find out some more about that today, is that you have been helped someplace along the line. 
LORETTA: I don't know. I had shock treatment. I know I had insulin and some insulin and deep insulin.
DR. FELDER: I didn't mean help in that kind of way. I meant, had the feeling you had been helped by some person rather than something artificial.
LORETTA: I don't know. 
DR. FELDER: Then there's something else I wanted to tell you. After they told me they wanted me to talk to you today. As I was going to sleep last night, I thought about you. I was sort of half asleep. This was half a dream. When you're half asleep, half awake. You and I were there in this place wherever it was and I was offering you a mushroom.
LORETTA: Oh dear.
DR. FELDER: And I got the feeling that you were afraid to take it because so many mushrooms are poison and then immediately you changed into a goose. A goose or a duck. I'm not sure which, which had two heads and two necks, and one pointed in each direction, in opposite directions. 
LORETTA: I don't know what to say about that. 
DR. FELDER: Well, I wasn't asking you what you thought about it. I just wanted to tell you about it.
LORETTA: I beg your pardon.
DR. FELDER: So to bring you up to date on where I am with you.
LORETTA: Well that's nothing. I had a dream that I was in back of the hospital and I did.
DR. FELDER: I don't know what you're asking me, but I'd like to tell you that I think you're capable of anything you dream.
LORETTA: Well I dreamed that I had a tooth that needed to be extracted and I didn't want it taken out, and he said, "either you have to take it out on your own free will or we'll give you shock treatment and take it out". And I said, "No. I don't want shock treatment". He said, "Well, I don't care. You're going to get it anyway and you're going to get that tooth taken out". 
DR. FELDER: I felt kind of mad when you were saying that.
LORETTA: I can't help, but that's the truth. That's what happened.
DR. FELDER: I wasn't mad at you. 
LORETTA: I also dreamed that my brother-in-law was in love with me, but he married my sister instead. And I couldn't figure that one out because I never met my brother-in-law until after I got out of this place. I've only seen him once or twice.
DR. FELDER: I can't figure that one out either.
LORETTA: I can't either, but I've dreamed about him twice. The time he was helping me and nobody else would. Well it was more than that. It was quite complicated though.
DR. FELDER: I felt sort of excited when you said that. I could feel my heart rate speed up. 
LORETTA: Well, he was the only one that would talk with me when I was (inaudible) . And my other brother, he said that was always the thing he could do was to talk to me. And I don't know where he got this information because they claimed they never talked to the doctors around here when I was let out. So I didn't[t know where he got his information, but my brother-in-law, he had a lot of talk to me. He said that was the worst thing he could do for me.
DR. FELDER: I was beginning to get tired of your talking. 
LORETTA: I don't blame you. (laughter). Everybody gets (inaudible) after a while.
DR. FELDER: What I was thinking is that, it's quite an experience to look into your eyes. It's kind of frightening to me. 
LORETTA: It shouldn't be.
DR. FELDER: And yet I like to. 
LORETTA: I don't try and hyponotize me. (laughter).
DR. FELDER: Well, I've felt it was sort of the other way around. You know, I felt like asking you if you could help me with this. Why should I be scared to look into your eyes?
LORETTA: You shouldn't be.
DR. FELDER: But why am I?
LORETTA: I don't know. Maybe you're a hypnotist. You hypnotized yourself. 
DR. FELDER: It sort of relaxed me when you said that, as though there must be some truth in it. 
LORETTA: You look like, ahm, what's that movie star's name? He's on TV a lot. McClock. No. I can't remember his name. He's always called in on these criminal cases when they can't - McGraw? I don't know what his name is. Pardon me.
DR. FELDER: I don't want to pardon you. I liked it when you touched my -
LORETTA: Now what?
DR. FELDER: Well, I think that's one of the exciting things about seeing you. I have no idea what now. What's coming next. 
LORETTA: I think your (inaudible) for a specific purpose, but I don't know just what it is.
DR. FELDER: Does it matter? 
LORETTA: Yeah. It does, because I don't like people to mislead me. 
DR. FELDER: I think you're right. 
LORETTA: I think you're trying to hypnotize me. I don't think it's working. 
DR. FELDER: Would you like to be hypnotized?
LORETTA: No. I wouldn't. I'm afraid of being hypnotized. 
DR. FELDER: I'll try not to. (background screaming)
LORETTA: I've been listening to that for three days. It's beginning to get on my nerves.
DR. FELDER: Do you think she's feeling anything?
LORETTA: I don't know. I know she doesn't want to be locked up though.
DR. FELDER: Do you think she's just trying to (inaudible) ?
LORETTA: I think she's been given so much medication, she doesn't know what she's doing.
DR. FELDER: Would you like a cigarette?
LORETTA: No thank you. I don't smoke. You better put on your sunglasses. (laughter).
DR. FELDER: Well, I'd sure like to because you still frighten me when I look in your eyes. I get very tense, but I'm not going to because I don't want to hide from you. 
LORETTA: I don't think you're hiding, but I don't want to be hypnotized either. 
DR. FELDER: Sure don't blame you for not trusting me. I don't trust you either. 
LORETTA: Good. I'm glad. I'm not to be trusted. I wish you'd (inaudible) glasses. (laugher) or else let me put them on. 
DR. FELDER: I don't think it's too important, but I feel like telling you that I'm very tense with you.
LORETTA: Well, that feeling is mutual. (Screaming in background) I wish she'd quit that screaming. That's what I wish. I don't think that's going to help. 
DR. FELDER: It doesn't bother me. In fact, more than wishing she would quit screaming, I think I kind of wish I were there with her.
LORETTA: Not me. It's too much. Been listening to her for three days. It's getting on my nerves. Not to mention the fact that my knees tickle all the time.
DR. FELDER: Tickle or tingle?
LORETTA: Tickle. 
DR. FELDER: You don't like that?
LORETTA: No. I don't. Should I? How would you like it -
DR. FELDER: I was just a little surprised. 
LORETTA: If your knees tickled all the time?
DR. FELDER: I think I'd like it.
LORETTA: Well, you wouldn't. I can tell you that now. They don't tickle like when you're ticklish. They just tickle. 
DR. FELDER: It's annoying, right?
LORETTA: Very annoying. 
DR. FELDER: I'll tell you what came to mind when you said it. It's a silly old saying that doctors tell patients when they've had a paralyzed arm and it starts tickling and the doctor says, "You should be glad because it means it's coming back to life". And the patients always thinking he's full of crap.
LORETTA: Maybe I don't want it back to life though.
DR. FELDER: That's just, that's what came to my mind. It was something about you coming back to life.
LORETTA: I don't mind being living or being dead, but I don't care for life imprisonment. That's about what you get when you come back to life.
DR. FELDER: This is kind of the way I see you too. I don't feel that you're alive.
LORETTA: I'm not. So -
DR. FELDER: And I don't feel that you're dead. I just feel like you're in prison. Oh. I almost forgot to tell you one of the most important feelings I had about you yesterday. 
LORETTA: I think you're handing me another line, but -
DR. FELDER: I do too. I'll skip it. Got any ideas how I can quit handing you a line and get really relaxed with you here and talk straight, quit lying to you? 
LORETTA: You're talking now, but I just don't like people to tell me something that isn't true.
DR. FELDER: I sure don't blame you, but I'm asking you do you have any idea how I can quit doing that? 
LORETTA: You're the doctor. I'm just the patient.
DR. FELDER: Well, you're a human being. You have feelings. You have ideas. 
LORETTA: I'd just like to go home and forget everything.
DR. FELDER: You want to go back to your room now? Is that what you want?
LORETTA: No. I said go home. Going back to my room is not going home.
DR. FELDER: I thought you were talking about you and me.
LORETTA: I don't have a private room anyway. I sleep in the dormitory. 
DR. FELDER: Suddenly felt glad that you had been courageous enough to take off the glasses.
LORETTA: I thought of a word called peristaltic this morning and I don't even know where I got it from, but I knew what it meant. 
DR. FELDER: I sure know what it means too. 
LORETTA: That is I didn't know what it meant. 
DR. FELDER: And I have a silly idea that you're answering my question. 
LORETTA: I have a silly idea that you're trying to hypnotize me. (overhead speaker in background)
DR. FELDER: (inaudible) ?
LORETTA: No. (inaudible) . 
DR. FELDER: Do you think I'm afraid you're hypnotizing me?
LORETTA: No. Why should you be? You're the hypnotist.
DR. FELDER: I'm scared. My hands are sweating. I'm shaking. 
LORETTA: Well, maybe you got a cigarette reaction. That's all.
DR. FELDER: No. I have a Loretta reaction. 
LORETTA: No. I don't think that's true. I think you're just telling me that. 
DR. FELDER: I don't think you believe what you're saying. 
LORETTA: I am not going to contradict you.
DR. FELDER: I had a feeling you wouldn't. I'm glad you didn't. Is there anything you'd like to ask me?
LORETTA: No. When can I go home?
DR. FELDER: We'll stop now. Thanks (inaudible)
LORETTA: Thank you.
DR. FELDER: You're welcome. 
LORETTA: (inaudible) 
DR. FELDER: Thank you for coming.
END TRANSCRIPT
BEGIN SESSION #2 WITH DR. CARL ROGERS
DR. ROGERS: (inaudible) It must seem confusing and odd and so on. But I feel when you left, I felt really sorry that the interview had been kind of cut short, because I sort of felt maybe there were other things you wanted to say.
LORETTA: I don't know. I'm really new. So (inaudible) transfer. And I was just wondering if I'm quite ready for a transfer. I mentioned that it's annoying, that woman talk or been yelling like that, but I really rather like that ward. And I had been hoping, I had thought maybe I could go home from there. I know being transferred (inaudible) and I don't feel quite up to that. 
DR. ROGERS: That's one immediate thing of concern. Am I ready to face whatever is involved in moving away from the spot where I've -
LORETTA: You get kind of oriented to one place (inaudible).
DR. ROGERS: You get sort of used to it and -
LORETTA: I meant to correct one thing when I said no before. I didn't mean I was talking to that doctor. I just meant (inaudible) that I was ready - that I wondered why I couldn't go home. 
DR. ROGERS: But we felt we didn't quite understand you on that, that really -
LORETTA: He thought I was being blunt and I just meant, no. I didn't want to talk to him anymore. 
DR. ROGERS: If I sense some of your feeling now, it is a little tenseness that maybe he didn't really get that. Maybe he thought you were sort of -
LORETTA: I thought that he thought I -
DR. ROGERS: Shutting him off or something.
LORETTA: Yes. That's what I had thought and that isn't what I meant. I don't know. I'm wondering if that transfer is a good thing. I mean they make you feel so important around here (inaudible) you aren't, but then when I go over to Two, I know that's an open ward. That's dormitory. And I've been wearing not so many of my own clothes, because I don't like to loan them. (inaudible) quite ready for that change.
DR. ROGERS: Um hum. And that -
LORETTA: But my father and aunt don't come to visit me or anything. So I don't get out at all on weekends or anything. 
DR. ROGERS: And I'm not quite sure about this, is it in the ward where you are now that you feel they seem to make you so important, but then really you're not? Is that?
LORETTA: That's really it. I'm important, but I'm really not. I probably would be on the other ward if - well I know that you're not very important when you're moved to that ward. 
DR. ROGERS: I see. So that if you're not very important where you are right now, you feel than if you were transferred even less so.
LORETTA: Even less so. 
DR. ROGERS: That's something that concerns you.
LORETTA: I think it means working (inaudible) the laundry and I'm not quite ready for that. I mentioned earlier that I had this tickling sensation in my knees when I was on 6C. When I was getting (inaudible) and (inaudible). And I asked the doctor if at that time if he would move me so I could go to work and work in the laundry. And transfer came today. I didn't ask to be transferred over to them.
DR. ROGERS: The trouble is whether you're really ready to face some of the things that would be involved. 
LORETTA: I don't know - there isn't much to face. It's kind of confusing I think.
DR. ROGERS: I see. It's more a question of facing the uncertainty. Is it what you mean?
LORETTA: I don't know what I mean. (laughter) I just know that -
DR. ROGERS: Right now you feel kind of mixed up?
LORETTA: Well I know that there's Anita on that ward that I didn't trust very far because she's the one that put me on shock treatments. 
DR. ROGERS: I see.
LORETTA: Well I think she did anyway. And still she put her arm around my shoulder when I came back, but she was the one that told me I had to go on it, and that I had done this, and that I knew of to be put on that kind of treatment.
DR. ROGERS: So there's something that's real confusing. To be putting you next to a person who seemed to like you and put her arm around you. And by gosh, was responsible for shock treatment.
LORETTA: That's right. Of course she said it was doctor's orders, but I hadn't talked to a doctor that I knew of at the time. And I know that they gave (inaudible) even though that was a work ward, they had them go over to the treatment ward and then back to the work ward, and then to work. 
DR. ROGERS: Your sure you hear all the explanations it was doctor's orders and all that, but you can't help but feel is she really trustworthy. Because here she seemed to -
LORETTA: Well I don't trust people anyway any more. That's why I don't want them to trust me. I either believe in them or I don't believe them. 
DR. ROGERS: And it's all or none. 
LORETTA: And I don't think I quite believe in her very much. 
DR. ROGERS: Really with most people, you feel, I don't think I trust them.
LORETTA: That's true. I don't trust them. Either believe them or I don't believe, or I'm not quite certain whether I believe them yet or not. But I don't believe in trust anymore. 
DR. ROGERS: That's one thing that you feel has really dropped out for you. That just to trust people. Not for you.
LORETTA: No. I don't trust them. You can get hurt much too easily by trusting people.
DR. ROGERS: If you really believe in someone and let your trust go out to them, then I guess you can -
LORETTA: I don't have any trust. That's why I can't let any trust (inaudible) .
DR. ROGERS: Evidently your feeling is that when that has happened in the past -
LORETTA: You just get hurt by it.
DR. ROGERS: That's the way you can get hurt.
LORETTA: That's the way I have been hurt. 
DR. ROGERS: The way you have been hurt. 
LORETTA: I don't mind being moved. I mean if it's another thing toward going home, but I don't get out anyway and I don't know that he - my brother - I wrote a letter, but I didn't get any answer from him. He never came. 
DR. ROGERS: It isn't, at least what I understand you to be saying is, it isn't this practical question other than the move so much that, but it's the question of -
LORETTA: Am I quite ready for that.
DR. ROGERS: Yeah. Are you ready for a next step? Is that -
LORETTA: I don't think I'm going to like working in the laundry. That I know, because I didn't like either the other two times. And I don't think I care too much working in the food center over there either, because I worked there before and I didn't care for it. Well I didn't have anything - The first day I worked or the second day I worked for about a half an hour and I blacked out. I tried it three more days and I blacked out each day. So I just quit trying to work there. It was too much electricity or something.
DR. ROGERS: You feel something was wrong over there. Too much electricity or something that really had a bad effect on me when I was working there. 
LORETTA: It did. I blacked out completely. If I hadn't gone and sat down, I would've have fainted.
DR. ROGERS: You feel really you were in kind of a desperate way at those times?
LORETTA: No. I didn't feel desperate. I just - I didn't understand it. I didn't know why I blacked out.
DR. ROGERS: I see.
LORETTA: It did frighten me though. I just couldn't work so I .(inaudible).
DR. ROGERS: Just something very odd happening to you more -
LORETTA: Because I don't have epilepsy seizures or anything like that. So I couldn't imagine what it was. I don't - I'm not. I don't usually have fainting spells.
DR. ROGERS: This made you feel real puzzled. "What is happening to me?"
LORETTA: What it was. Yeah. I tried. So I couldn't work and they wanted me to work. So sometimes I think you could be put back on treatment if you refuse to work.
DR. ROGERS: You know, maybe shock treatment is really something they may use for punishment if you don't do the things they want you to do.
LORETTA: Well it would appear that way from what everybody says, but I don't think I was even - I don't know why they even gave it to me in the first place. I was just beginning to come to enough to realize that I was in an institution I think. And the next thing I knew, they said, "You're already on treatment". And I said, "Why? I didn't do anything. I haven't had any fight or anything with anybody." And they said, "Well, doctor's orders". And I said, "Well I haven't even talked to the doctor", because I hadn't talked to one. At least, I didn't know if I had. 
DR. ROGERS: So you it seemed, here I was just beginning to come to life a little, to really to know a little bit what was going on.
LORETTA: I was just beginning to realize I was in the hospital when they put me on it. And they put me to work the same day.
DR. ROGERS: Then you feel that for no reason you could discern -zingo - you were -
LORETTA: I began talking very badly and everything. I still haven't forgotten some of the things they said.
DR. ROGERS: Feel that as though that sort of brought out the worst thing you had ever (inaudible) .
LORETTA: If I had - it was like it wasn't even me talking.
DR. ROGERS: Almost seemed as though -
LORETTA: Then I went home weekends and I got in trouble there because I talked so much. Of course, I was getting sodium amytal too. So it might hive been the combination of the two, not just the one thing. 
DR. ROGERS: There too, I guess I get the feeling that you're wishing you could understand that part of yourself. Whether it's something that was not you talking or was it just the effect of the drugs or what was it that made you act?
LORETTA: It was a combination I think. As you noticed, I move my feet. 
DR. ROGERS: Yes. I did notice.
LORETTA: As I said, my knees tickle. I don't know if it's the drugs I'm getting or what, but it's something I can't help. It isn't that I'm so terribly nervous that I can't sit still. That isn't it. I do that at group meetings or anything, and I can't control them. It's rather embarrassing.
DR. ROGERS: You would like me to understand that it isn't just tenseness or something, it's -
LORETTA: I'm not do-
DR. ROGERS: (inaudible)
LORETTA: Something I can't control.
DR. ROGERS: Uncontrollable tickling sensations. 
LORETTA: In my knees and therefore, and my feet just move. If I am sitting up there in the corner alone, that isn't so much, but my knees still tickle. But when I get in a group and that - my - my knee just moved.
DR. ROGERS: Feeling as though being in a group makes this worse.
LORETTA: Well I have it when I'm alone sometimes too. I think it's medication I'm given.
DR. ROGERS: Probably it's just the drugs.
LORETTA: I think it's the gray medication I'm getting. I don't even know what it is because I haven't asked (inaudible) . I think these meetings are very enlightening.
DR. ROGERS: Do you? 
LORETTA: Well, if she can't think quite clear at this time, you can think about it later. 
DR. ROGERS: In that sense, they're somewhat helpful in making -
LORETTA: I think I've been helped a lot by -
DR. ROGERS: You think more clearly (inaudible) .
LORETTA: More by talking than I have by the pills (inaudible) . 
DR. ROGERS: Really it seems as though getting things out to some degree in talk.
LORETTA: It seems to alleviate whatever the situation is. If it's created a situation that seems to alleviate (screaming in background) - I wish that woman would quit screaming. 
DR. ROGERS: Why doesn't she stop.
LORETTA: She can't stop. (inaudible) that's the worst of it. That gives you a terrible feeling, what's going to happen to you if you end up like that.
DR. ROGERS: Part of the disturbance of that noise is the feeling, "My God. Could this happen to me?".
LORETTA: Yes. Exactly. You think you could just about go out of your head just from hearing that all the time. That's been going on for three days now and why did they give her that much? If it's who I think it is, she was up on the ward for one of those GYN clinics and I sat next to her and she said something about liking to talk. An all of a sudden she just - she just began talking and didn't quit.
DR. ROGERS: This seems kind of awful. Here is this person and -
LORETTA: She was perfectly all right, then calm. She wasn't (inaudible) or anything.
DR. ROGERS: Next to you and telling them and now here it's just going on and on. 
LORETTA: I should think - I thought they could relieve those, not make them worse.
DR. ROGERS: And that's kind of discouraging in a sense to feel that they seems to - that they aren't helping her.
LORETTA: Yes. Considering it's an admission ward and they shouldn't be that far out of their heads. It's more like the drugs they're giving (inaudible) are doing it to them. 
DR. ROGERS: Almost makes you feel, are they making her worse with their drugs. Isn't it?
LORETTA: That's right. 
DR. ROGERS: That's kind of a disturbing -
LORETTA: I think it is.
DR. ROGERS: Thought too.
LORETTA: Because after all, I'm getting drugs too and I wouldn't want to end up like that. 
DR. ROGERS: You can't help but raise the question in you, with the drugs they're giving me. Make me like that.
LORETTA: That's right. And then once you're that way, what can you do about it. Only, only I know what they're like and I can see it. So I have enough control to hang onto myself not to keep from just batting my head against the wall like you - some of them have that feeling and they just can't control it. They - but I've seen so much, but it hurts so much of it, that I can't hang onto myself a little bit.
DR. ROGERS: Yeah. Those things are kind of -
LORETTA: I think that's why - pardon me. I think that's why my knees tingle all because rather than batting my head against the wall, I have that type of reaction. 
DR. ROGERS: So in a sense you can hold yourself enough so that you aren't going to bat your head against the wall. Yet it's as though it has to come out somewhere and it comes out -
LORETTA: It comes out . the tickle is terrible.
DR. ROGERS: In the tickling of your knees. 
LORETTA: Because, well I've seen my (inaudible). So I mean I know that it's just futile to bat your head. Anyway I think my head is too valuable to bat against the wall. It's my own head and I like it. 
DR. ROGERS: By gosh. I'm not going to smash my head against walls.
LORETTA: That's right. After all, God gave me that head. That's the head I want. I'm not going to bang it against the wall even if I like to, which I really wouldn't like to do anyway. How does that help that girl to be locked up like that and screaming like that? I mean what beneficial aid is she getting out of that? 
DR. ROGERS: I guess that's the question -
LORETTA: Anything?
DR. ROGERS: I guess that's the question you're asking yourself, what earthly good. -
LORETTA: No. I'm asking you.
DR. ROGERS: Asking me. Well, I'm not on the hospital staff and I really guess I wouldn't try to answer because I don't know her and don't know anything about it, but what I can understand is the way that that affects you and the feelings that it stirs up in you. Sounds as though with you that is disturbing not only from the noise from her, but the things that it stirs up in you.
LORETTA: I don't know. I'm all mixed up. I want to go to building 1, but still, I know building 1 is not (inaudible) home (inaudible), but if I can go home tomorrow, I'd say yes. I've been there before. I know it's going to be a great change from this building. I hate to leave this building because it's quite beautiful. But still maybe its better than listening to that girl screaming all day or everyday.
DR. ROGERS: It's a real tough choice to make.
LORETTA: But I hate to think that I'm going to have to go to work in the laundry all week. I'd rather - and there isn't as much to do around that ward as there is here. That much I know. 
DR. ROGERS: To feel (inaudible) 
LORETTA: Like people laugh in their sleep because you do have (inaudible), but I don't think they do. I think they expect you to work if you come. They don't go that far as to just let you rest like you're in a hospital for a rest. Keep you working all the time. 
DR. ROGERS: If it represented a chance to rest, then you might like it. But if it's a chance just to work all the time, then you're not sure that (inaudible).
LORETTA: I don't think I'm ready for it. Because my knees tickle. Maybe that - I worked in the laundry before and I know. I got a long all right. I know I can get along now, but -
DR. ROGERS: I could do it, but am I really (inaudible) for it.
LORETTA: But why?
DR. ROGERS: Why. 
LORETTA: Well I packed my own (inaudible) I'm more ready to go. I didn't say "No. I won't go", because I'm always putting up a big fight about it. If it's an improvement, well I'm willing to go along with it.
DR. ROGERS: Chance you're willing to take, although within yourself, you feel a lot of question about it. 
LORETTA: I'd rather like to feel than admit it, although I can't say that I like to see them get worse. But when they improve, it's quite a joy to be where they're all coming in and going out.
DR. ROGERS: It kind of helps you inside when they get better.
LORETTA: I know that others get well (inaudible) 
DR. ROGERS: So that you're sort of discouraged and encouraged of what happens in others.
LORETTA: I had thought - I had thought that I'd go home from here because I haven't done anything very serious or I hadn't had any violent struggle with anybody or anybody, anything like that.
DR. ROGERS: That's part of your feeling (inaudible) "I haven't done anything wrong. I've held myself in a - I really have not been violent. I haven't broken many rules". 
LORETTA: I haven't broken any I don't think.
DR. ROGERS: Broken any. 
LORETTA: And you have to find - find out what the rules are because they don't tell you.
DR. ROGERS: But the feeling is I've been good.
LORETTA: But I haven't been too good though. (inaudible) can go over board about being good too. I don't believe in that either. I've been as good as I know how to be and I'm not letter perfect. I would like to be, but I'm not. 
DR. ROGERS: In terms of what you can do, you feel you've done the best you can do. 
LORETTA: Good. It's good (inaudible) how.
DR. ROGERS: Loretta, I know that some of these people have gotten to go and I expect you will get to collect (inaudible). I appreciate the chance to talk to you.
LORETTA: Thank you very much. I know that you're very important people. That's what I've heard anyhow. 
DR. ROGERS: Nice to - nice to have talked with you.
LORETTA: Thank you. 
END TRANSCRIPT
DISCUSSION SESSION
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
MODERATOR: I think the - I think the difference in the interviews was dramatic and at the same time there were similar patterns manifested .
I think when Al was interviewing her, he was working in an area that she felt comfortable in. Namely the area of verbal dueling and with her, character defense. So that the exchange was strictly in terms of the power struggle that she engages in. Dick did not engage in a power struggle with her. This threatened her and frightened her. It undermined her usual defense of talkativeness and verbal dueling. And at the point where she began to feel some communication with him, she tried to resort again to the defense of the power struggle by insisting that he was trying to hypnotize her by insisting that this was a struggle between them. And something in her had to reconstitute the events that (chairs moving in background) he could not permit himself to fight with her, and I think this was unnerving to her. And the dramatic change was the change from talkativeness and clowning to a feeling of anxiety and tension with the lowest of the usual defense, and I thought it was beautifully handled within limits in view of the circumstances. 
PARTICIPANT: Why did you terminate the interview?
DR. FELDER: I felt like she was saying she wanted to - (speaker announcement in background). I want to go home. I always assume the patients talking about her and me, no matter what she says.
PARTICIPANT 2: Dick, I want to ask you something. Several times (I was sitting behind you), and several times I thought you were going from the borderline of technique to feeling, technique to feeling, and I thought of all the stuff written on a double bind. You know? When you communicate on one level and you're saying something on another level. And at these points, I felt that's where the contact began to get a little shaky and I felt that you're saying to her, "Yes, I'm concentrating more on technique now than on you", was the point where she was helped because you were being honest with her. 
DR. FELDER: I intuitively double bind schizophrenic patients in the beginning of therapy.
PARTICIPANT 3: You do?
DR. FELDER: Yes. For a long time I felt terrible about this, but I have come to not feel terrible about it because I think it puts me in the position of being their parent. Then they get mad at me about it and I'm glad to hear them being mad about it. Whereas the parent would refuse it.
PARTICIPANT 2: Are you always comfortable in your capacity to extricate yourself from the double bind or is that why you use (inaudible) ?
DR. FELDER: Yes. I'm not saying I extricate myself. I'm saying that I'm proud of them for not tolerating it from me. But I go in and deliberate - not deliberately, unconsciously deliberately be a bastard. And sometimes I'm horrified at this, but it seems to be an unconscious technique, whereby I become as bad as the parent. 
Well, I'd like for somebody to answer a question for me. I was terribly tense through the whole interview and never got over it. (laughter).
PARTICIPANT: I felt that I was just going to offer as a comment. I thought you terminated to comfort to your own tenseness.
DR. FELDER: Well I declined to terminate the first time I thought she asked to, because I didn't want to terminate out of my own anxiety. 
PARTICIPANT: - rather than undermining completely. . .  
DR. FELDER: I had no idea - had no idea previous to the interview that I could relate to her on a positive basis. It seemed utterly fantastic to me this was even possible. 
DR. ELLIS: I think you proved that it wasn't. And I think you were tense because there was never any contact between the two. You were exactly different things. She was saying one thing and you were saying another thing. This went on consistently. (cross talking). 
DR. ROGERS: I think on the subverbal level, it was a sort of communication (inaudible). Were you conscious of the constant edging up of her, both her feet that (inaudible) ?
DR. FELDER: Yeah. 
DR. ROGERS: This was confused (inaudible) (cross talk). (inaudible) yesterday as well.
DR. FELDER: She said, "Pardon me" and - (cross talking). Well, I don't see what you're talking about. 
FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Well she was (inaudible) (cross talking)
DR. ROGERS: We received communication in this sense. Not always, but sometimes we're in - in that your next response shows that implicitly you must have received hers. All right. That's mostly what ordinary conversation is, but I think of her (inaudible) as a person frightened (inaudible) most people in her state - (inaudible).
FEMALE PARTICIPANT: - not the deepest thing I felt that she said there. I felt real, I'm real (inaudible) . This business about lights and (inaudible) I would have really wanted to understand her. 
DR. FELDER: Well, now if you remind me of two brakes I had on. One Max telling me I have to keep my brakes on in here and John telling me to cut the interview short. And I respect both of them enormously. So I'm sure that was part of my intensity. She was taking care of me when she challenged me on my sincerity the second time. Because what I was going to tell her was that that I had forgotten was that my feeling of how terrified she was yesterday. I feel now that if I had told her this, she would have had to deny it and she didn't want to put me in this embarrassing position. And she protected me both in embarrassing situation by stopping (inaudible) 
PARTICIPANT: When I was sitting behind you, Dick, (inaudible) recall what Carl was talking about with your eyes. There was a characteristic about this woman in terms of our discussion yesterday, Jule. I felt beyond being frightened, she was terribly frightened of her own aggression. She was very hostile. 
DR. FELDER: And so was I and I told her. 
PARTICIPANT: And that's what you were talking about and maybe that's what Harry had sensed with this breakthrough was that she could become violently angry and she was frightened of it and so she couldn't decide which role she should play. 
DR. FELDER: I guess the reason I felt that she would not do that in here was because I was able to tell her that I was scared. 
PARTICIPANT: I think she was (cross talking). 
DR. FELDER: The one thing she can't tolerate is a positive relationship (inaudible) 
DR. ELLIS: One thing that she can't tolerate is somebody being more irrational than she. 
DR. FELDER: She can't tolerate that?
DR. ELLIS: That's right.
DR. FELDER: I beg to differ with you. (cross talking) Indeed I wanted - I wanted to be (inaudible) with her that I can be crazier than she can. 
DR. ELLIS: And this poor girl is grasping out for some possibility of rationality and you're regressing. 
PARTICIPANT: I think that the - I think that when you have a damaged ego, you don't .. you don't threaten it so directly with subsequent, with the consequent anxiety that comes out, which only leads to a remobilization, remobilization of events in terms of "I don't trust you. You're trying to hypnotize me". There should be some communication between the two levels. 
DR. FELDER: There was a point where I did what you're suggesting. I should have done more of. That was when I told her I didn't trust her. 
PARTICIPANT: Why did you tell her that?
DR. FELDER: Well, I started to say because I felt it, but that's not quite true. It was more technique. 
PARTICIPANT: That's what I felt (inaudible).
DR. FELDER: But I think technique in exactly what you're talking about. To hear something for your ego now so you won't be so troubled about what we're doing, about my (inaudible) you.
PARTICIPANT: Yes. I felt that this was an artifact, however. When you said, "I don't trust you". 
DR. FELDER: Yeah. I didn't feel that. That was technical.
PARTICIPANT: It was technical. It was by way of saying, "I'm not the one with the power. You are the one with the power". And she said, "You're not (inaudible)".
DR. FELDER: All I'm saying is that I was doing what, what you were referring to I think.
DR. ROGERS: I can't help but come back in here predictably. It's very interesting. Most of the time, especially with a discussion of this sort (background noise) - I can really let other people have their own way of working with people and realize, sure, which works one way. 
Very surprising how deeply I feel in that yet in an actual specific situation, how much of a partisan I have become. So what I will say now is definitely partisan. But I can't help but feel truly disturbed by the fact that we are so convinced that all the judgments have to be made in US! We get to know if her ego is strong enough to fix this and so then yield a little to her unconscious. And does she mean by peristalsis what I mean by it? Sure. I know just what she means by it. So, the hell you do. I feel like saying all of that stuff. (laughter). And my feeling is that there is an in-between kind of way. Curiously that happens to be the way I work. (laughter). 
But the - take combining (inaudible) these things just fit. It seems to me that when she was afraid you were hypnotizing her, I feel it really would have helped to have tried to understand that, which would have led into the kind of thing you were just saying. I mean if one had responded, "you really are scared, but I'm going to somehow exercise power over you". Yeah. I'm sure. (inaudible) you're talking about. 
And on this peristalsis thing, pick any angle. But there, I would say, "You don't know what you mean. I don't either. I have hunches, but I don't know". And I would've, I would've liked to respond, "somehow this experience had real meaning for you. That this is a turn that somehow seemed to make some kind of sense to you". Then I think she would have felt very much drawn to explain what kind of sense it did make to her. Then I would know whether she was gradually beginning to know it whether she was talking about a positive experience with illness or whether out of the fact, out of that experience or the total experience, where things are in the hospital, or what not. 
Another meaning that occurred to me whether she felt that the life does have a rhythm and things do digest and move on through,. And I just feel we would not need to make all the judgments and all the decisions in ourselves. Dammit we have the best resource for knowledge right there in the other chair.
PARTICIPANT: Carl, can I ask you a question since I kind of (inaudible) ? 
Why don't you start with her and from an analytical point of view, I'd be interested in knowing more about now (inaudible) peristalsis. But it's been my clinical experience inside her history, that she can (inaudible) for months, with elaborate conundrums on peristalsis spelt backward, forward, up, and down. 
DR. ROGERS: Not if you responded to the feeling. If you notice, the way I responded, it wasn't all, "What is the meaning with (inaudible)?". The context of feeling in which she expressed that, but here was something important. She didn't know why. Didn't know where it came from. The cause. She didn't understand the point. All right. That feeling I would respond to. And then she starts to give me some elaborate intellectual thing which I don't believe she would. It just that (inaudible) . Okay. So she does. Then I would respond to the feeling context of that. That, "I guess your feeling is now that there really is a precise definition of this that makes so much difference to you". 
PARTICIPANT: - ask something that I don't feel (inaudible) (laughter). Let's suppose you did say to her you were hypnotizing her and proceeded to hypnotize her. What do you think would happen at that point? I have an idea. I have done this with exactly the same kind of patient. But I would like to know what you think would happen?
DR. FELDER: I'm afraid I can't answer it because I have never hypnotized anybody nor would I ever any more than I would give anybody shock therapy. 
PARTICIPANT: You don't think it's fair.
DR. FELDER: I don't feel it's fair. 
Two questions I wanted to ask you or one. Did you think I was saying that I consciously and purposefully was doing some ego repair?
DR. ROGERS: No. No. I was speaking more about the comment on the (inaudible). 
DR. FELDER: Second question. Do you think she would say the same things to you that she would say to me? 
DR. ROGERS: That doesn't make any difference. The thing I feel is that with most of us or I would add with any of us, though I know some would differ with this, if the thing moved at all or she would get more and more into feeling (inaudible) the one generalization I would make. Then I'd think if that's cool with you then I think that would be cool with me. 
FEMALE PARTICIPANT 2: I was wondering, Doctor Rogers, she asked several times forreassurance about the way the hospital was treating these patients. 
PARTICIPANT: (inaudible) what?
FEMALE PARTICIPANT 2: Reassurance -- about the way the hospital was treating these patients, of which she is one. And I know you all have met the hospital staff, but still, you were there. You were the only person she could ask. I wonder why you didn't give her the reassurance of this instead of disassociating yourself from it. Since you were a person in authority in this hospital as far as she was concerned at the moment.
DR. ROGERS: Yeah. I'll answer her. I want to make sure somebody in the hospital is here to hear my answer because part of my feeling is I wouldn't (inaudible) the hospital proceedings because in my experience hospitals are made of the human beings and human beings are not always right (inaudible) . I feel she is in a hospital. So the things she is uncertain about, "Are these people treating people right" and "Is there any assurance I'll get well" and so on. But if she weren't in a hospital, it would be other people that she felt the same kind of issues about. No. I'd prefer to try to help her live with the situation which I'm sure has bad elements in it, as well as good elements, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't be properly assuring her. (inaudible) 
PARTICIPANT: I'd like to give my impressions of the three different approaches of the other two. I think with Al, he was working with a defense that she had and in that defense, actually stimulating it and mobilizing it in terms of inducing her to fight with him and to engage in controversy. I think with Dick, he didn't fight with her, but with his intrusive kind of warmth at that time, he was threatening her and thereby tended to remobilize her defense, namely "I don't trust you. You're trying to hypnotize me". I think Carl did neither of these things, but what he did do was not fight with her, thereby not giving substance or support, subsidizing this combative controversial clowning defense. Instead stayed with her on a level that she was prepared to stay on.
Now this brings us to another point and that is what is her motivation. She is not coming here for therapy. She has her own ideas about what she's going to get out of this situation. I think her ideas have been the same for the most part, although she has secondary gratification as she did yesterday. Her idea is, "I want to have this jury help me in my hospital situation", and this was her continual preoccupation. And this is the thing that you of necessity related to. Namely, "Am I going to transfer to this ward or to the other ward? Am I ready to be transferred? What can be done?", so on and so forth. And in terms of motivation, I think that the most constructive kind of approach was the one that you used with her. 
DR. ROGERS: Could I differ a little bit with one thing you said? It might be the incorrect way to comment, I feel that part of her motivation is this jury, that she may well be. Part of it though is the desire of any human being to get somewhere within themselves. So that I feel it isn't a question. Whether this person or any other is motivated for therapy. It's a question of whether or not I can reach that motivation. Whether that is so deeply buried you can't touch it or whether you can some way (inaudible) respond to it. 
One reaction I'd like to give a different sort of experience -- I don't know what I did expect her to begin with, but I somehow sort of thought it would have been some way kicked off from her contact with Dick. I was a little floored by this notion of the practical problem of transfer to another ward. But it's interesting to me and it seemed to be evident several times in this (inaudible), that if you're willing to stay with what is meaningful to the person, even though it seems like trivial administrative bunk, it leads somewhere in each case, it led to something quite (inaudible). 
PARTICIPANT: I think the difference where it went had to do with the therapist not with the patient. There is a striking difference in the two therapists that we saw having the study because they were both therapeutic images. In the first place, I think Dick accepted her as another adult, as he met her frontally more or less. (inaudible) and the exchange was in terms of his person, as well as her person. 
With you, there wasn't a single comment about your person. She wants tried to ask you a question about the hospital, which is sort of a long way around to get to you. And it brought me back to some of the child guidance days where the person and the therapist is doled out in real small doses because the disturbed patient is so little Her response to this seemed to me was to become more and more defensive even in terms of her transfer, which initially though she announced that she was (inaudible) .
JOHANNA: It's interesting. I had the opposite feeling exactly.
PARTICIPANT: She did not announce (inaudible) 
JOHANNA: I just said that the first interview today was to (chair scraping) and the second one was much closer being two adults. 
FEMALE PARTICIPANT 4: I didn't hear what you said (inaudible).
JOHANNA: The first interview was much more two children. Not two adults. 
PARTICIPANT: I think what John was saying, Johanna, is on the surface, this is the way I understand, on the surface, possibly calls this more adult, but on the deeper level, Dick is dealing with the more adult material because he's confronting her more directly -
JOHANNA: But the direct -
PARTICIPANT: Way of life.
JOHANNA: But what you confront this person with, what you confront her directly, is her babyish, most babyish self.
DR. ELLIS: All I hear is reading in again, because I have also (inaudible) and cause is unquestionably much different in my mind, makes it much better and it was better than mine because I was intent on doing something else than you were. I was intent on literally showing a technique and you approached her therapeutically by far the best of all three as far as I can see. All three of us, but the significant thing was that this patient has not moved an iota. She is exactly where she was when she came in to me. She will be here as far as I can see 50 years from now because I suggest to you, going on and on and on like this, and she is very concerned with specific problems (inaudible) anything to really solve the problem. She wants you to solve, wants me to solve, wants Dick to solve these problems for her.
JOHANNA: Seems to me this is a contradiction of what she said. At first she didn't trust anything. Now she's saying she's putting some trust and faith in the hospital. I felt this could have been affirmed somewhere. Certainly she's going to trust the administration -
DR. ROGERS: No. She's going to let (cross talk) trust in herself more than (inaudible)
PARTICIPANT: She simply said, "I'm doing this, because if I don't do it, I'll either beat my head". (cross talk)
PARTICIPANT: (inaudible) that isn't used by you, Carl. I don't know just in terms of therapeutic technique. You got two things that she led you to and I think this is your affirmed belief. I think personally I would use some juxtaposition. When she says, "I don't trust anybody", and then she makes three appearances here, I think I would like to know, "But you came here three times and you say you don't trust anyone". When she said -
DR. ROGERS: Can I pick it up right there and answer? Because that's a very good example. That certainly occurred to me (inaudible) also are these equally strong things occurred to me. She was, you can say she was saying, "I don't trust you either. I want you to know this" and so forth. But the reason I don't do that is that, and here I'm speaking from someone that's in physiologic research or just getting started, and I'm talking off the top of my head on this stuff. I'll bet you that if you had used this response you speak of, you'd have seen the PGI go shooting up. In other words, I would prefer to keep a threat level situation as low as possible because in my estimation, that's the best way for her to deal with the internally threatening things. 
PARTICIPANT: And I would say that the threat level should be kept at some optimal level for the quickest movement and I don't think that the lowest level is necessarily optimal. 
DR. ROGERS: Well, let me, let me put it this way because I realize then - I didn't quite communicate there. I would like to keep the external threat as low as possible because then I think the person who left the internal threat rises as high as I can tolerate (inaudible) 
PARTICIPANT: Well with your physiology (inaudible), how are you going to distinguish (inaudible) the external from the internal?
DR. ROGERS: That's (inaudible) (laughter). I don't have an answer to (inaudible) impossible.
PARTICIPANT: I have been sort of watching this. I didn't see now, Al Ellis's interview yesterday, but I - in fact probably, part of the problem we're getting entangled with is -- which is the preferable approach to a total situation. Now I think personally that if I, myself, were carrying this as a case, I would probably start with your technique. I would move very cautiously, very slowly, feeling my way. Letting her come forward. At some point somewhere, I think I would move toward Dick's approach, being more provocative, even sexually arousing as I think he somewhere advertently or inadvertently attempted to be, and then taking up some of these things and eventually ending up if there were movements aroused, assuming that there were, with something more on an intellectual level and a direct exchange, if this ever became possible. 
I feel that this is how the problem of the difference between the eclectic approach and the approach where we feel we‘ve got to stick to one way consistently. I think that there is more likelihood that somewhere at a given point we have to shift from one approach to another. Now this may not be true in all cases either. Some cases may be (inaudible) totally in one fashion. Now, I really would like to know how some of the people here, including yourself, Carl, (inaudible). But I think that this is an area we tend to neglect because we have so much vested interest in the given approach. 
As for the physiological point, I think that the arm PGI sometimes may be a very important indicator of movement. Now whether we should keep it high or let it fluctuate, I know with some of my schizophrenic patients where we have some records of when we get this little shift, we know that something is happening, because we take it out and move it. 
PARTICIPANT: I'd like to firstly underline very heavily what Henry said, but there is one addition which I would note is rather important in many of the cases we have seen and this reminds me of what many of us have seen so often in diagnostic reports. We see so much of what's wrong with the patient and often not enough of what is right with the patient. What do we have to work with in this particular patient? 
Now, I think in our sessions too we often encourage what we say to patients who speak of what's wrong with them. I felt for example in the session that you had, Carl, where you talked about trust. She talked about trust. But she didn't start off by saying, "I don't trust anyone". The initial attitude was, "I either trust someone completely or I don't trust them at all". 
PARTICIPANT: I believe them or I don't believe them.
PARTICIPANT: All right. Whatever, but (cross talking) but what I felt was picked up more was the not trusting. I think this is the thing that turns into control. You have a patient who may speak of fear or anxiety about maintaining control. But at the same time, is managing to have some kind of control. But we often talk about the fact that she's afraid of it rather than she has been able to do it. 
So that what I'm trying to get at, I'm trying to get the patient to perhaps get some kind of picture of herself, an image of herself. We want her to see what's wrong, but we also want her to realize that here is hope in terms of the fact that there are things that are right with her and that these are the things that are really going to help her get well. 
DR. ROGERS: Even more importantly, (inaudible) there's another (inaudible) see both those aspects, but you really live them. I feel that's what therapy is to give them a chance to live the worst aspect of themselves, the things they're scared to death of, and to live the constructive aspects. I quite agree that there should be room for both. 
If I can comment just to go back to Henry's statement just for a moment because there's something I would really like to say on this. That is,  that though I think there is much to be said intellectually for an intelligent eclecticism. Yet I would have to say, Henry, that you couldn't start with the same "technique" that I used today if in the back of your mind is the feeling that it is your judgment that you are trusting as to when to change the approach. Because the very basic part of my approach of me in this situation was both for today even when I had feelings of, "Oh my goodness. That's trivial stuff (inaudible)". I was willing for it to be her situation and just follow. In other words, you can't - if I'm only going to trust her potential for movement up to the point where I decide I better do something else about how to have her move, then that represents a different quality than really trusting her potential (inaudible) .
PARTICIPANT: I also got to make a comment on this too. I agree deeply with Carl's approach with this patient in this single interview and for a very specific reason among others. But the main reason is being that this particular patient -- any interpretation or any comment or observation is construed as an accusation and as a challenge. Now it seems to me that what you were doing in this interview in my terms was giving very effective ego support in the sense that you were saying, "You are a person with choices. You choose this. This is your perception of things – this is the way you feel". This was constantly reminding her that you knew that she was a person capable of independent judgment, capable of making choices, and having feelings. Now I think that if, had this kind of supportive therapy and I would call it supportive therapy, continues, a time is reached when her tendency to construe an interpretation as an accusation would be reduced. At that point, I think the patient dictates a certain change in our approach to them.
PARTICIPANT: I'd like to throw in a thought. What struck me was how they seemed to be three different people. I didn't see the comment about the person who could trade blow for blow was certainly a different(inaudible) person that I saw (inaudible) other times. This is about (inaudible) respect to the problem of varied therapists as we have seen them, having success. Maybe we have success because we work with our person. 
DR. ELLIS: No. I think that's wrong. I think we have unusual unanimity of agreement here (inaudible). Because I agree with what Jules said and I agree with what Henry said, and I agree to a large extent with what Carl did today in that if I were seeing this patient under normal circumstances, I wouldn't do an exactly (inaudible) or anything like that. But for many sessions, I would just get her to open up and respond (chair moving) . I completely get what Dick says because I think it is very wrongful. He was way off the beam. He didn't know what he was doing. He was completely autistic. He had no contact with the patient and so on. So I would give that (inaudible) . Gradually I would get to my own phase. I think that there has to be with this kind of patient who is a small minority of individual, and I still have a basically poor prognosis for her in particular. That there has to be some kind of difference in movement and in technique, because I don't see now doing what Carl would really get done indefinitely, would get her to change her basic plot or anyone else for that matter.
FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I'd like to communicate something which was very important to me in my perception of this patient (inaudible). It's very important to me and I would like to try to (inaudible) . It has to do with the thing that I like most about your approach and that is your respect for self-direction and autonomy. To me this patient's reactions were such a beautiful illustration of this in a way that had continuity from yesterday to today. I responded very much against what you said, when you said that her reality of the patient today was a decision made because of yesterday, that she was good and cooperative. You weren't here yesterday. You didn't hear her response. What she said at the culmination of the attempt to calm her was in effect, "I will stay in the hospital and I will die before I will accept this (inaudible) ". 
PARTICIPANT: (inaudible) after thinking about her. 
FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Then today she came with a dream of a tooth which she wanted to keep and somebody was trying to take those away from her. In my mind, she requested this of you. 
DR. ELLIS: In my mind, there is.
FEMALE PARTICIPANT: And then, (inaudible) with her. Then she was able to feel her own upcoming and she was able to feel her own self directly and that she was able to apply that reality (inaudible) .
FEMALE PARTICIPANT 5: I'd like to say something about this. Now I wasn't here yesterday either and people who where I was know that my general approach was pretty much more like Dr. Rogers. I feel very strongly, in agreement with what you have said, but I do believe that besides the dream, we have the evidence of her reaching out for other members of the group, which was certainly somehow related to what had happened before with Al. I think we have the fact that she came back with a tape, the fact that she came back to the very room and sat down. I can't help but feel that if we're going to make some of the other interpretations we made with some facility, that something positive must have been involved.
FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I (inaudible) . I believe in that very much. I think Al reached her. I think he reached her in a way which mobilized her determination that she was not going to submit to (inaudible) . I think you reached her and it was effective, and she came back fighting. Then I was so pleased that Carl was able to come in and (inaudible) 
PARTICIPANT: Say something about what you said, Jules, where you felt that this was an ego supportive approach and Carl was using that and enhancing the positive feature. I think it's also important and I would agree with that, but as a - also she was allowed to admit confusion and doubt and uncertainty.
PARTICIPANT: Which is ego supportive to that, "I have a right really to my doubts and uncertainties and I can acknowledge my confusion. I don't have to be perfect". At one time she said, "I feel as if I ought to be perfect". But then she modified it and she said, "Well, I'm not perfect". This I think is ego supporting. (inaudible)
FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I wonder if Dr. Peterson would care to say anything about this.  
DR. PETERSON: Oh I could make some comments about the group, but I think (inaudible) (laughter). 
PARTICIPANT: We're ready.
DR. PETERSON: Or maybe that's a very important thing to hear which is here on one end is Dr. Rogers and another end is Dr. Ellis. Maybe they represent two extremes. I don't know. Maybe all the rest of you folks are somewhere in between, but regardless you can bet a plug nickel that Dr. Ellis's percentage of helped patients is probably equivalent to that of Dr. Rogers. However, the same percentage would apply in general to the whole group. I don't know, but we can only agree it seems that way and so normally inescapable conclusion you can come to is that there must not be anything horribly wrong with people in any of these techniques. Oh we can fight like cats and dogs (inaudible) (laughter) what's wrong with one guy and what's right with the other. I think that possibly since this group apparently ostensibly is gathered here to learn, well maybe that might be one variant we could sort of investigate, perhaps to learn by this experience, what these common denominators are that cause patients to get better in spite of such a wide variations in approach.
PARTICIPANT: That's why we sent (inaudible) (clapping).
