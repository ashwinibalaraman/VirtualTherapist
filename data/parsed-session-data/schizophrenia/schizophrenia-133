<b>Eleanor Morris, "Easter Sunday"</b>


<i>The poet Anne Sexton thought that writing poetry kept her sane</i>.
Shortly after her first suicide attempt at age twenty-eight, Sexton
was institutionalized at Westwood Lodge, a comfortable sanitarium
not far from her home in Wellesley, Massachusetts. While
recuperating, Sexton met a talented young musician who was also
a patient of her psychiatrist, Dr. Martin Orne. "I was thrilled to
get into the Nut House," Sexton later told a friend. "I found this
girl (very crazy of course) (like me I guess) who talked language."
By "language," Sexton meant the bold, figurative language of poetry.
According to Sexton's biographer Diane Middlebrook, the

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sexton had another id√©e fixe: She wanted to be admitted to
McLean. "I want a scholarship to McLean," Sexton confided to
her longtime friend and amanuensis Lois Ames, as if she was talking
about a fellowship to the American Academy of Arts and Science.
Sexton certainly had the qualifications: Two suicide
attempts by the age of thirty; extended stays at the Glenside and
Westwood Lodge sanitariums. She wrote about her mania in her
first poetry collection, <i>To Bedlam and Part Way Back</i>. She reveled,
theatrically, in her madness and was not above exploiting her
shocking mood swings to manipulate her friends and family. But
Dr. Orne, wary of McLean's high prices and extended stays, refused
to commit her there. Sexton had won the Pulitzer Prize and
been profiled in national magazines. But she had never punched
her ticket at McLean.


Why McLean? Because of Sylvia Plath and Robert Lowell. "We
both recognized that Plath and Lowell had been there, and she
wanted to be in that lineage," Ames says. "The same way she
wanted to be buried in Mt. Auburn cemetery, where her family
was buried." Sexton was ferociously competitive with Plath in all
respects. Both had been reared in Boston's well-to-do western suburbs.
Both women were fearfully articulate, beautiful, and sexually
alert. They had both committed themselves to big poetry, publishing
in the big magazines (<i>The New Yorker, Atlantic Monthly)</i> and
with the big publishing houses (Knopf and Houghton Mifflin),
and to winning the big awards (the Yale Younger Poets Award, the
Pulitzer Prize). Each knew she was unstable and vaguely understood
that psychological torment somehow produced good poetry.

<i>Thief!<br />
how did you... crawl down alone<br />
into the death I wanted so badly and for so long</i>.


The experiences of Lowell, a mentor of sorts, weighed heavily
in Sexton's thinking too. Although deeply versed in classical poetry,
Lowell wrote in a beautiful American vernacular, and he
wrote about life as he found it, whether it be an uncompromising
portrait of his ineffectual father ("Father's death was abrupt and
unprotesting") or a heartrending description of returning to his
wife and daughter after a few months in the "bin" ("I keep no rank
nor station / Cured, I am frizzled, stale and small"). As a student
in his class, she could not help but notice that he disappeared
around Christmas time, sometimes to McLean, when his mania
overwhelmed him. One of Sexton's first recognized poems describes
the ungainly Lowell, "like a hunk of big frog," leaving his
crowded poetry seminar to make the trip to the hospital grounds
in suburban Belmont: "I must admire your skill," Sexton wrote.
"You are so gracefully insane."


<i>By the time he first checked in to McLean in 1958, Robert Lowell was, as</i>
they say in the consumer-products field, a repeat user. Forty-one

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Robert Lowell was the uncrowned poet laureate of McLean just
on the strength of his magnificent poem "Waking in the Blue"--
excerpted at the front of this book.


"Waking" was included in the book <i>Life Studies,</i> which many
Lowell scholars believe to be his best book. It is intensely autobiographical
and unsparing of his immediate and extended family.
One of the poet's cousins, Sarah Payne Stuart, has recently suggested
that the family's hostility to the poems may have precipitated
a breakdown that landed Lowell back at McLean. After
reading a prepublication copy of the book, Lowell's formidable
aunt Sarah Cotting announced that "I've just read what Bobby
wrote about [his parents] Charlotte and Bob, and it's just awful."
From her Beacon Hill town house, she marched downhill to Lowell's
home on nearby Marlborough Street and gave her nephew a
piece of her mind. (This was the same aunt who once mused,
while sitting on her yacht: "Why doesn't Bobby write about the
sea? It's so pretty.") "I'm sorry you didn't like it," Lowell answered
softly. "I thought it was rather good." A few weeks later, when <i>Life
Studies</i> was formally published, Lowell was at McLean.


Because he was born into the Boston aristocracy, Lowell understood
instinctively who was in McLean and why. He had
grown up with the "Mayflower screwballs"; the "thoroughbred
mental cases"; "these victorious figures of bravado ossified

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I live in an interesting house now at McLean's, one in which no man
had entered since perhaps 1860; suddenly it was made co-ed. It was
like entering some ancient deceased sultan's seraglio. We were treated
to a maze of tender fussy attentions suitable for very old ladies: chocolate
scented milk at 8:30; a lounging and snoozing bed read after
meals, each announcement of an appointment gently repeated at ten
minute intervals, an old crone waiting on table barking like television
turned on full to pierce through deafness. On the other hand, it took
three days to get a shaving glass.


The man next to me is a Harvard Law professor. One day, he is all
happiness, giving the plots of Trollope novels, distinguishing delicately
between the philosophies of Holmes and Brandeis, reminiscing
wittily about Frankfurter. But on another day, his depression blankets
him. Early in the morning, I hear cooing pigeon sounds, and if I listen
carefully, the words: "Oh terror. TERROR!" Our other male assembles

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Both men, and I too, shrink before a garrulous Mrs. Churchill,
sometimes related to the statesman and sometimes to the novelist.
"How are you related to Thomas Arnold Lowell?" I assumed she
meant James Russell Lowell, and was abysmally wrong and have
never been to explain. Pointing to a classical moulding on a mantelpiece,
she will say, "That's Cameron Forbes, the ambassador to
Japan," or begin a dinner conversation with, "Speaking of Rhode Island
reds..."


Sometimes with a big paper napkin stuck like an escaping bra on
her throat, she will dance a little jig and talk about being presented to
Queen Victoria. She was.


Lowell visited McLean four times over the course of eight years.
Like Plath, he left a paper trail of letters with the distinctive return
address "175 Mill Street, Belmont, Massachusetts." He is possibly
the only patient to have exchanged letters from the wards with
Jacqueline Kennedy; she thanked him for a book he had sent her
and congratulated him on getting away for the holidays. Lowell
also corresponded with the poet Theodore Roethke, who had his
own struggles with mental illness (Lowell: "I feel great kinship
with you"), and mailed a letter from Bowditch to Ezra Pound,
who had been locked up in St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington,
D.C. "Do you think a man who has been off his rocker as often
as I have could run for elective office and win?" Lowell
inquired of Pound.


I have in mind the state senatorship from my district--the South End,
Back Bay Boston, and your son's Roxbury etc. The incumbent is an
inconspicuous Republican. His rival is a standard losing party democrat.
I'd run as a democrat, and if I could edge out in the very difficult
primaries, then I'd cream the Republican. And then there'd be vistas
before me as I sat in the Boston State Capitol on my little $5,000 a
year job that would cost me about $10,000. What's your advice?

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is no trace of a reply.


Many of Lowell's students, some of whom became noted poets
in their own right, trooped out to Belmont to visit their mentor.
Some days, Lowell was very clear and his students would read to
him from books he had requested, or they would share poetry, occasionally
attracting a small crowd of not-very-aware patients. On
other days, Lowell was in the mania, reworking famous poems in
his copy of the <i>Norton Anthology</i> or retranslating, for naught,
works from Greek and Latin. The students were suffused with sadness,
seeing their brilliant teacher temporarily defeated by mental
illness.


Poet Frank Bidart, a former student who became Lowell's friend
and literary executor, recalls one visit:


People knew he was a writer. He was an older person, and there were
other older people there, as well as some kids in their twenties. There's
a way in which the place and the circumstances became very egalitarian,
each patient is just one more person with a roommate. There was
no hierarchy. Lowell was fine with that. I think he was a little embarrassed
at the beginning for me to see him like that, that he couldn't
leave, that I had to bring him books. I mean, he could have worn
shoes if he wanted to, but he didn't want to. He was living as if he
were at the beach or something, but he wasn't at the beach.


<i>Just before Alfred Stanton took over as psychiatrist-in-chief</i>
at McLean, Franklin Wood admitted a young woman who would
become the hospital's first mass-market celebrity patient: an intelligent,
troubled Smith College junior named Sylvia Plath.
Writing about her suicide attempt in her novel <i>The Bell Jar,</i> Plath
informed a generation of young women that one could suffer a
nervous breakdown and live to write about it, in theory, at

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The story of Plath's stay at McLean has entered the literary
canon not only by way of <i>The Bell Jar</i> but also from the pens of
numerous biographers and memoirists. The consensus tale runs
like this: Plath, a sensitive, erudite, and hard-working young
woman from a conventional but not particularly happy family in
Wellesley, Massachusetts, experienced mild depressions while
studying at Smith College. As versed in Freud as any budding intellectual
of her generation, she thought she had "penis envy" and
suffered from "schizophrenia." After winning a prestigious national
contest to work at <i>Mademoiselle</i> magazine in New York during
July 1953, she suffered a rare career setback; she was denied
admission to a Harvard summer writing seminar. Trapped at
home in August, drained of energy, she began to contemplate suicide.
After a half-serious attempt to drown herself during a beach
picnic, Plath swallowed an overdose of her mother's sleeping pills
and hid in a crawl space underneath her parents' home. She very
nearly died. ("Beautiful Smith Girl Missing at Wellesley" and "Top
Ranking Student at Smith Missing from Wellesley Home" were
two of the front-page headlines in the Boston papers.) Her family
and doctors properly concluded that her attempt exceeded the
classic suicide gesture and packed her off to McLean.

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As at Smith, Plath was a "scholarship girl" at McLean, supported
by the well-to-do novelist Olive Higgins Prouty, a forceful
and intelligent woman who had suffered her own nervous break-down
a quarter-century before. Talented and ambitious, Plath had
a knack for aligning herself with the best brains wherever she was,
and McLean was no exception. The psychiatrist with whom she
met every day was the aforementioned Ruth Tiffany Barnhouse, a
real New York Tiffany and a rare female doctor at McLean. Freudians
would call it a transference; whatever the case, Plath fell in
love with her doctor. In <i>The Bell Jar,</i> Plath invoked her <i>Mademoiselle</i>
magazine training to describe "Dr. Gordon," as she called
Barnhouse in the book: "She wore a white blouse and a full skirt
gathered at the waist by a wide leather belt, and stylish, crescent-shaped
spectacles. This woman was a cross between Myrna Loy
and my mother," Plath concluded. Who could ask for anything
more?


Although Plath did provide vivid descriptions of life at McLean
in her letters, she rarely discussed her therapy. In one sense, there
was not a great deal to discuss. When Plath first arrived, Barnhouse
decided to supplement psychotherapy with insulin shock treatment,
which not only failed to address the patient's acedia but also
caused her face to bloat up and bruise, spoiling her natural beauty
and compounding her crisis of self-doubt. Like most McLean patients,
Plath was dosed up on the antipsychotic drug Thorazine,
which contributed to her affectless behavior. Months after arriving,
her therapy was blocked. "I got her to draw things first, and
then I had gotten her to talk, which was already something," Barnhouse
recalled. "But she had been in there for months, and Mrs.
Prouty was paying the bills--this was going on and on. She was totally
depressed and she wasn't getting any better."


Mrs. Prouty was visiting Sylvia regularly, and she was becoming
quite impatient with McLean. In November, she wrote a letter to
director Franklin Wood threatening to stop paying for a treatment
regime--Prouty felt it was nontreatment-that seemed to be leading
nowhere. Prouty herself had spent time at Silver Hill in Connecticut,

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Plath's story was approaching its climax. Barnhouse decided to
gamble and proposed electroshock therapy to the young girl. The
idea of shock therapy was plenty scary, but it was especially scary
to Plath, who had suffered through several painful and impersonal
shock sessions at the hands of Dr. Peter Thornton and then Kenneth
Tillotson at Valley Head Hospital that summer. She had received
no anesthesia for the treatments, and after being
semi-electrocuted, she had been wheeled into an empty recovery
room to cope with her trauma. "She was not properly protected
against the results of the treatment," Prouty wrote to one of
Plath's doctors, "which were so poorly given that the patient remembers
the details with horror." Prouty was a meddler, but an
informed meddler, and she voiced her opinion that the botched
electroshock sessions had driven Sylvia to attempt suicide. Plath
herself later described the "rather brief and traumatic experience
of badly-given shock treatments" at Valley Head to a friend:
"Pretty soon, the only doubt in my mind was the precise time and
method of committing suicide." But Barnhouse promised to stay

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They were. On December 15, Plath received the first of two
shock treatments. She regained her personality and composure so
rapidly that she was able to spend Christmas at home. Prouty
brought her a typewriter, and Plath resumed her erudite and
chatty correspondences with friends: feeling better; the company
is swell. She rejoiced in the high-minded company: a classmate
from Smith, girls from Vassar, Radcliffe, and Cornell, "plus an
atomic genius from M.I.T." The hospital officially discharged her
in late January, and by February she was back at Smith. Five years
later, Plath mentioned the treatments in her journal: "Why, after
the 'amazingly short' three or so shock treatments did I rocket uphill?
Why did I feel I needed to be punished, to punish myself."
Neither she nor Barnhouse could explain the miraculous turn-about.
"I can't tell you what happened," Barnhouse said in a 1998
interview.


The human mind is very complex.... That sounds obvious but people
keep forgetting it. They think you just throw a little Prozac in here,
and a little of something else in here, it'll do this, this and this. It's
ridiculous.


Nobody can explain why Sylvia got over her depression after one
or two shock treatments. She just didn't want to have any more shock
treatments, so she reorganized herself inside so she wouldn't have any
more. I never saw it happen with anybody else, but I wouldn't be surprised
if it did happen.


Most psychiatric hospitals still administer a milder form of
shock treatment, more palatably rechristened "electroconvulsive
therapy," to blocked patients. When it works, doctors are still at a
loss to explain how.

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Barnhouse and Plath continued to see each other long after their</i>
McLean encounter. When Plath lived in Boston in 1958 and 1959,
she saw Barnhouse professionally, as often as once a week. To
Plath's considerable chagrin, she often lacked the money to pay
her therapist, who lowered her hourly rate to five dollars to accommodate
the struggling young poet. On Plath's side, the transference
held strong. She wrote often about her need to be
"worthy" of Barnhouse's friendship. She idolized the older
woman, who seemed to be successfully juggling her psychiatric career
with a strong marriage in which she bore responsibility for the
raising of three small children. (The marriage later broke up.) By
contrast, Plath fretted constantly about her career and worried
that having children with her poet husband, Ted Hughes, would
impede her literary progress. Although Barnhouse probably
would not have admitted it-she soured on both Plath and
Hughes at the end of her life--the psychiatrist probably stuck with
Sylvia, gratis, because she was flattered by the attentions of the rising
literary star. "The paid business is (not silly) but irrelevant,"
Barnhouse wrote to Plath in 1962. "If I help you, it is my reward. I
would love to have the dedication to RB. [Plath had talked about
dedicating a book of poems to Barnhouse.] I have often thought,
if I 'cure' no one else in my whole career, you are enough. I love
you."


Their therapy sessions worked wonders for Plath. "Better than
shock treatment," Plath wrote in her journal. To Plath's great satisfaction,
Barnhouse gave her "permission" to hate her mother: "'I
hate her, doctor.' So I feel terrific. In a smarmy matriarchy of togetherness
it is hard to get a sanction to hate one's mother especially
a sanction one believes in. I believe in RB's because she is a
clever woman who knows her business and I admire her." A few
months later Plath wrote: "RB has become my mother."


Plath and her husband moved to London in 1960. The therapy
sessions ended, although Plath did telephone her old friend and
mentor on rare occasions. In late 1962, Plath's marriage plunged
into crisis; Hughes was having an affair. Sylvia wrote Barnhouse a

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Has he left you? OK, sad, tragic stupid, unfortunate, anxiety-provoking,
BUT NOT THE END. There are other ways of life, which may or
may not involve another man.... You help neither him nor yourself
by going down in a whirlpool of HIS making. Decide what you will
put up with and what you will not. Stick to it. Don't be anyone's
doormat. Do your crying alone....


The psychiatric pitfall that I see is your succumbing to the unconscious
temptation to repeat your mother's role-i.e., martyr at the
hands of the brutal male. If he really needs a succession of two-dimensional
bitchy fuckings, let him have it. Set your conditions (quietly,
in your own mind). Get a good lawyer, make him feel the bit of
responsibility for the children (BUT NOT FOR YOU) in his pocket-book.
Stand back and be an old-fashioned lady. If he is a boor, throw
him out. If you happen to want to go to bed with him, do.


Nine days later, Barnhouse was lecturing Plath on the importance
of selecting a first-class nanny ("Get a really, really good
one") to throw into the child-care breach and offering more, concrete
suggestions on coping with her rapidly dissolving marriage.


If you really mean it about separation and not liking him, I would advise
going whole hog and getting a divorce. You can certainly get the
goods on him now while he is in such a reckless mood. If you wait,
until he finds out a) you're not as spineless as he thought and b)
maybe he made a mistake and wants to wiggle in again, you'll have a
much harder time getting the evidence....


The rest, you have said for yourself. Keep him out of your bed. In
the U.S., if a woman sleeps with her husband after he has committed
adultery, she can no longer sue him for divorce on those grounds as

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Plath and Hughes formally separated the following month.
Four months later, Plath committed suicide at the age of thirty.


<i>In 1968, Anne Sexton got her wish, sort of. Like a bolt from the blue, Sex</i>ton
received an invitation to teach a poetry seminar at McLean:


Dear Mrs. Sexton,


During the past two months, I have been directing quite a small group
of McLean patients who write. Some are quite talented; some of the
poems, especially, are fascinating.


I have heard you had, at one time, an interest in the writings of
psychiatric patients; the patient who told me this is a great admirer of
yours and suggested I invite you to address the group. I would like to
amplify her suggestion to include a possible series of workshop or lecture
meetings which you would lead. Your visit or visits would be immensely
valuable to motivate as well as instruct the patients.


Margaret Ball, Patients' Librarian


The librarian's proposal was well timed. Not only was Sexton
still fascinated by McLean, but she had just befriended a young
Philadelphia poet named C.K. Williams, who had been teaching
poetry in a mental hospital. Williams was ghostwriting books for
local psychiatrists and had started up a literary magazine edited by
the disturbed patients of the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital.
"The editorial meetings started becoming group therapy, and
we started taking advantage of that," Williams remembers. The formal
term the psychiatrists used to describe the patients'quasiliterary
outpourings was "primary process thought." "The thing I
found amusing was that the people who were most floridly psychotic

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Still, she had her doubts. "Anne was quite agitated one day, and
called and said she'd been asked to do a poetry workshop at
McLean," recalls Ames. "She saw this as an enormous responsibility.
'What if they're suicidal?' she asked. 'What if I say something
about a poem that sends them over the edge?'" Furthermore, except
for a high school seminar she had arranged with a friend, Sexton
had never taught before. The pair decided that Ames, an
experienced social worker, would help her teach the seminars at
McLean.


The seminar assembled every Tuesday evening in the hospital
library. Typically, Sexton would read a few poems written by her
contemporaries, such as Diane Wakoski, Frederick Seidel, Robert
Bagg, and Aliki Barnstone. Discussion would range from highly
agitated to desultory, depending upon the mix of student-patients
in the room. Sexton would ask each participant to prepare one or
more poems for the following session, which Margaret Ball would
collect during the week. Ball then sent the poems to Sexton's
Wellesley home, where she read them and prepared her comments
for the next class.


Some of Sexton's initial trepidation about her new charges was
confirmed. From week to week, there was no way of knowing
which patients might show up for the seminar. Although some patients
enjoyed privileges to meander around the hospital grounds
or even take the subway into town, others emerged from
maximum-security wards with aides, dubbed "angels," holding
them gently by the wrist, meaning that the patient was on suicide
watch. Some patients' conditions varied from hour to hour, not to
mention day to day. A patient who wrote an excellent poem
might then disappear for several weeks until his or her condition
improved.

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Robert Perkins, an author and documentary filmmaker now living
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, described the seminar in his
1994 memoir <i>Talking to Angels:</i>


While I was [at McLean] Anne Sexton taught a poetry-writing class.
She would come every two weeks to meet with a small group of aspiring
poets. It was as boring a two hours as any other, although some of
the students were entertaining. These wackos would rise to their feet
and make up their poems right there, often yelling them out loud. A
chorus of nutcakes. Occasionally, Anne Sexton would speak, but more
often she sat there with the rest of us and let events swirl around her.
If people wanted to argue about poetry or about poems, that was fine
with her. Most of us, and I was one, could barely raise our heads, let
alone write poetry or find anything intelligent to say.


Eleanor Morris, then a young patient who had dropped out of
Bryn Mawr several years before, preserves a different memory of
the sessions with Sexton:


I have a mental image of Anne leaning on something in the library,
maybe a piano, and the rest of us sitting around in chairs. She assigned
us exercises, and you had to read your own poetry, which took
a lot of courage. What I remember most is the blue, blue eyes. Her
eyes were a piece of hope for me to see every week, they were daring
me to do something.


Ellen Ratner, who has channeled her intense energy into a successful
career as a syndicated radio talk-show host and television
commentator, now reflects cynically on the proceedings: "Frankly
I couldn't care less about poetry but she was famous and I wanted
to meet someone who was that well-known." Ratner called Sexton,
who was often mistaken for a model or an actress, "Sexy
Anne," and even questioned her motives for teaching the
"loonies." Ratner remembers, "I said, 'Well, Sexy Anne, why are

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To be fair, there is no evidence that this suggestion is true. Sexton
kept few notes of the sessions, and most of those were teaching
guides for herself. She wrote only one poem, "Out at the
Mental Hospital," about her experiences at McLean, and she
never published it:


<i>No one has been tamed out at McLean<br />
See how the machine man is pounding with his stick!<br />

There was no shortage of breeding or brainpower in the Sexton
seminars. Perkins sprang from one of Boston's venerable First
Families; he had interrupted his studies at Harvard for a year to
acquire his McLean "diploma." Morris was a collateral relative of
Ralph Waldo Emerson and Frederick Law Olmsted. But Sexton's
favorite student proved to be a young girl from Fort Smith,
Arkansas: Eugenia Plunkett, who had suffered a nervous break-down
at Radcliffe College and checked into McLean.


Plunkett, an attractive and precocious high school poet, had
been a patient at McLean for five years before meeting Sexton.
The transition from Arkansas to Radcliffe and Cambridge of the
1960s had overwhelmed her. "She wasn't prepared for the transformation
to Harvard," says her younger brother Robert, a businessman

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It may have been Plunkett who suggested that the patient librarian
invite Sexton to teach at McLean. Although she made
much of being shy, she sent Sexton some of her poems before the
seminar began and emphasized that she was a big fan. In one
note, she told Sexton, "I feel like your stringbean girl," a reference
to a famous poem ("Little Girl, My Stringbean, My Lovely
Woman") that Sexton had written on the occasion of her daughter
Linda's eleventh birthday.


The two women corresponded between classes. Sexton gossiped
about the other patients in the seminar and enjoyed sharing confidences
with her young acolyte. When Plunkett announced that
she had left her psychiatrist because he had divorced his wife and
refused to embark on an affair with her, Sexton--no stranger to the
temptations of the therapist's couch--reacted knowingly:


He could have handled it better. Of course you felt rejected, but it
seems too bad that you had to stop seeing him. One thing I'll say. All
the psychiatrists I've seen have been crazy and yet I learn from them.
From your description of him you certainly wouldn't want to be married
to him, but I know the feeling better than you think.


Sexton offered heartfelt congratulations on Plunkett's success
when she published poems in the <i>Hudson Review</i> and the <i>American
Scholar</i> during the seminar. And she did not hesitate to criticize
Plunkett's work more firmly than that of the other patients.
Upon receiving one batch of Plunkett's poems, Sexton wrote her,
"I find them quite different and not worth much bother on your
part.... Frost once said a poem should be 'lively,' not personal. I
say a poem should be personal--in the sense of somebody having
really lived something they are writing about."


At other times, Sexton would proffer advice tempered by her
own considerable self-doubt: "Your work is very accomplished.

One of Plunkett's most harrowing and successful poems appeared
in the <i>Hudson Review</i>. Entitled "Encounter, Psychiatric Institute,"
it took place at McLean:


<i>That awful<br />
Anonymity.<br />
She smiled at me<br />
From her pinned-down, stretch-out position flat<br />
On the tilted stretcher two big men<br />
Were hustling down the stairs. "And whom have I<br />
To thank for care of me?" she seemed to say.<br />
She smiled at me. Dark red and bright red were<br />
The colors of her arm. Suddenly I knew she'd done that shredding.
Dire, innocuous smile!<br />
That anonymity? All people, strange<br />
(Sudden, yet by an awful, slow degree<br />
I knew), could never get a small word in<br />
On her dark room, her razor, finger, arm,<br />
Or her blind soul presiding. "Hearye!" she<br />
Said to the dark room of the world, alone.<br />
And later even, outside, like galaxies<br />
Of rocks--the stars--or animals--the dogs--<br />
All we could ever do was stand and stare.<br />
And there, the arm, bare. Like her own soul, bare.<br />
She smiles at me across the ribbons--flesh--<br />
That say, "I am alone--without a sound</i><br />

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the summer of 1969, Plunkett returned to Arkansas, where
she remained in touch with Sexton. In June, she announced that
she had again been institutionalized; "No sweat, though, be out
soon, I think." She described the experience of listening to Sexton's
poetry/rock record, <i>Anne Sexton and Her Kind:</i> "I cried all the
way through 'Her Kind.'... The music is haunting, but nothing
to the words. Had to hold my aide's hand--she, poor kid, not having
the faintest idea of what was going on."


That was the summer of the moon landing, and Plunkett sent
Sexton a poem about the event. In her last letter to her former student,
Sexton wrote, "I was pleased that you sent the poem to me
although I didn't understand it. Your rhyming is very skillful, but I
do hear you, Jeanie, I do hear you sing." Later that year, Plunkett
published her only book of poetry, <i>If You Listen Quietly,</i> which included
the poem "Fragment for Anne." Sixteen years later, after an
adulthood beset with psychological and physical disorders, she
died of a neurological seizure in Fort Smith at the age of fifty-three.


<i>How good were the other students' poems? A few of them were very</i>
good and were eventually published. Most of the poems were student
quality, some good enough to print in the hospital newsletter.
And some were just blots, words scrawled on paper by men
and women shocked into the verges of catatonia.


One anonymous patient satirized his mental predicament:


<i>Once I could<br />
and now I can't<br />
Write poetry<br />
I merely rant</i>

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sexton believed in encouraging all of her McLean students.
When the late journalist John Swan wrote a poem called "Kids,"
describing his feelings for the his two young daughters, Sexton
handed back his work with "GOOD" swathed across the page in
capital letters. When she read this fragment of Swan's,


<i>This last time<br />
When the children were told I was off<br />
For another rest...<br />
Lynn cried quietly...<br />
Her real cry</i>.


Sexton responded, "Powerful--maybe better than anything Lowell
or Sexton has done on the subject." The praise was real, and her
comment anything but casual. At the time, Sexton perceived Lowell
as an important competitor, and both poets had trouble expressing
affection for their children in their poems.


At one point, Plunkett chided Sexton for being too solicitous of
her students' feelings. "You seem afraid to discourage anybody."


In a letter, Sexton responded, "You are right. I don't like to discourage
anyone at McLean. I feel that everyone has something to
say and will perhaps, in time, have more important things to say.
Poetry led me by the hand out of madness. I am hoping I can
show others that route." But Plunkett's complaint wasn't quite
true. When Sexton sensed that one of her students could take
constructive criticism, she freely dished it out. She continually
pressed one of her poets, who later published a small collection of
his poems, to push himself beyond writing fragments and expand
into poetical form. He sent her these lines from a poem called
"Anticipating Sexton":


<i>I thought her eyes were green<br />
before she came.... The scene<br />
was her with lanky bone<br />
and skirt above bare</i><br />

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She wrote back, "Good ending" and asked for "another verse
about what she is like--however disappointing to me personally."


Perhaps better than Plunkett, Sexton understood how close to
the precipice some of her students were standing. Three girls in
East House produced a mimeographed book for Sexton, entitled:
"Behind the Screen: Poems from the Maximum Security Hall."
Several were on suicide watch and wrote about it. One not untypical
fragment:


<i>(Half the skill of succeeding at suicide<br />
Comes with having a decent knife.)</i>


"The needs are so immense at McLean," Sexton wrote halfway
through the seminar. "And although I try to meet them I generally
fail."


<i>In the spring of 1969, conflicting commitments started pulling Sexton</i>
away from the McLean seminar. She taught her last class in June.
She corresponded with several of the patients for a few years after
the class. Although she eventually lost touch with them, several
followed her high-profile career in the newspapers and magazines.


Perhaps inevitably, the intensely self-critical and depressive Sexton
viewed the seminar as a failure. In December 1973, she gathered

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Whatever her misgivings, the McLean seminars did give Sexton
the confidence to press forward with teaching. One of the
McLean students organized a weekly seminar for his Boston-area
Oberlin classmates at Sexton's home. Then Sexton arranged a faculty
appointment at Boston University, where, in the 1970s, her
poetry seminars achieved the same mythic cachet accorded to
Lowell's classes in the 1960s.


The McLean students seemed to love Sexton, for her celebrity,
for her own struggles with mental illness, and for the effort she invested
in the course. Margaret Ball, who sent Sexton periodic updates
on the patients' lives between the seminars, informed her
more than once that her works were stolen more than any other
author's: "'All My Pretty Ones' (replacement volume 4) lasted 1
week on the shelf before stolen.... It's their highest compliment,
because usually they're so honest."


Robert Perkins, who remembers Sexton as "very pretty and very
nervous," wrote that "I've since come to appreciate how difficult
it must have been for Anne Sexton to come back to the hospital
and deal with a group of loonies. She had been there herself.
Maybe she felt she could help one of us. Maybe she did."


<i>In 1973, Sexton's awful wish was finally granted in full; she was admitted</i>
to McLean as a patient for five days of psychiatric examination.
The grim "Patients' Property Form" is one of the few documents
remaining from this visit, detailing that Sexton surrendered her

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00183&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sexton's former student Eleanor Morris met her teacher unexpectedly
in the North Belknap medium-security hall. "She remembered
me from the seminar, but we didn't talk much," Morris
recalls. "She looked so awful.... my heart went out to her." Here
was the terrible leveling of mental illness; Sexton, the elegant,
chain-smoking, Pulitzer Prize winner cast adrift among her
student-patients on the desperate ocean of unhappiness. Sexton
was just one year away from her own suicide, firmly embarked
upon her <i> Awful Rowing Towards God</i>, the title of her last collection
of poems.


Morris still remembers her clock radio waking her on Saturday,
October 5,1974. A newsreader announced that the poet Anne Sexton
had died. "It just said she had died, but I knew she had committed
suicide, and I spent the whole morning crying," Morris
says.


Morris still has a copy of a book of poems that Sexton gave her
after one of the seminars, a 1966 collection called <i>Live or Die</i>. In
the flyleaf, Sexton wrote: "My directive is LIVE--to Ellie."


Eleanor Morris is living and writing poetry in Concord, Massachusetts.
