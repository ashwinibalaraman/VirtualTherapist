The days passed slowly. One tired of playing Ping-pong
and Scrabble. I was frequently asked to keep score at these
games. Reluctantly I would turn to this painful task.


Some of the patients tried to crochet, but our rugs would
usually turn out as triangles rather than as squares.


I enjoyed etching with charcoal best. This occupation
seemed to ease my tensions. I kept drawing trees and more
trees.


"You're in the woods," Dr. Schoen would say as he looked
at my trees.

"Yes, I know. I am indeed lost in the woods," I would
answer. "Will I ever find my way out?"


At times I tried my hand at painting in oils, at which I
had had a smatter of training. I would copy portraits, some
of which took on a human likeness.


Dr. Schoen would look at them and say, "I am no art
critic."


I thought this was his way of saying that my art was no
good.


Although Faith, Bette, and I became fast friends I always
felt that I was a little on the outside. Faith and Bette would
sit cross-legged on their beds and talk. I believe that they
would have spent the nights together if the attendants had
not separated them. I would sit on my bed listening. Sometimes
we discussed our husbands.


Things had gone quietly for some time. I began to think
that I would soon be allowed to spend the weekends at home
with my husband.


On this particular day, we were seated on the beds talking.
Dr. Schoen burst into the ward in an angry mood, A
nurse from another ward was with him. Between them they
held a distraught and struggling Marie.


I asked myself what had happened. Whisper, whisper.
Rumors were flying.


Dr. Schoen and the nurse dragged Marie to a back room.
Surely, I thought, he must be taking her there for tender
words. How wrong I was.


"Marie tried to hang herself with a bath towel," my nurse
comforted me with a pat of her hand. "She was allowed to
visit her family last weekend, and she has been very upset
ever since."


I wondered what hold Marie had over Dr. Schoen. I
would watch her cagily in the weeks to follow. If she were
the doctor's favorite, I would imitate her. Then, perhaps, he
would like me too.


"I know whom to imitate now," I told Dr. Schoen. "I'll
imitate Marie."

"Don't imitate a sick person," he advised.


"Well, then, I'll imitate you," I replied.


He turned on his heel and left the ward. He seemed unable
or unwilling to supply an answer to this remark.
