SIX-STEP REFRAMING
______________________________________________________________________________
CONNIRAE ANDREAS: This videotape features a demonstration of six-step reframing, an NLP method developed by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, that can be used with a wide range of problems or outcomes. You'll join an introductory weekend NLP seminar from September 1988 on the morning of the second day.
I first introduce reframing with a story and brief discussion. Then you'll observe the complete demonstration of reframing with Elna, who wanted to stop smoking. Following the demonstration is some discussion, and finally a follow-up interview with Elna.
CONNIRAE: During World War II at the height of Japanese expansion there were-as some of you may know-Japanese garrisons on hundreds if not thousands of islands throughout the Pacific. They were expanding all over the place. Now the soldiers that went to these islands were very loyal. They were dedicated. They were trained that no matter what, they were to defend their people and their country. That was their job. It was their mission.
From their perspective, what they were trying to accomplish was to defend their country from external threat. Now when the tide of the war changed, a number-quite a number of these islands got overrun. And a few of them got missed though; there were just too many. And any of you who've looked at a very complete map or know much about geography know that there are just too many islands to get to all of them.
So consequently some were missed. And others were in fact overrun. But there were small units of isolated Japanese soldiers somewhere in the back-in caves-some isolated spot that really couldn't be gotten to very easily.
Now as a result of this, in the years following the war, from time to time one of these Japanese soldiers would be discovered. The way they would be discovered is that some unexpected tourist boat would go by and it would get shot at, or a fishing boat would get shot at. And this would alert them that someone was there.
Now this happened for up to 30 years after World War II. That was when the last one was discovered to my knowledge, where they still found another one of these soldiers still out there fighting the war.
Now when you think about it, what would be appropriate to do with one of these soldiers when he is discovered and returned back to civilization? What kind of approach would make sense? I mean one approach would be to go, "Oh, what a stupid jerk you were. I mean you were fighting a war for 30 years that wasn't even going on anymore! How stupid can you get? You know, isn't that ridiculous?"
Now what the Japanese government actually did is really fascinating to me, and unusually responsive and sensitive to those soldiers. What the Japanese government did is they thought about it from the perspective of that solider who was doing his best to do what he'd been told to do. Do what he thought his mission was-namely to protect his country-to protect his people.
And when one of these soldiers was discovered, they would get a high ranking official who had actually been a high ranking official during the war, get him to get out his old uniforms, put them on, get out his old samurai sword or whatever, go out to the island. And they sent that high ranking official to be the first one to meet the soldier.
And he'll call out in Japanese to the solider and greet him. And upon greeting him, the first thing that that Army official would do was thank him for being such a loyal supporter and for doing his job so loyally-so faithfully for so many years.
Then gradually they would embrace the guy, welcome him back into culture-into the culture very gradually over the course of about three days. They would let this person know that the war was over. That he no longer needed to fight. They would bring him back to his homeland to Japan and give him a hero's welcome. They give out medals. They sometimes did parades-the whole works to give a hero's welcome to honor his return home, and his entrance back into what was currently a more productive, more useful way of being a part of Japanese society.
So this morning we are doing six-step reframing. I really like six-step reframing. It's one of my favorite all-purpose patterns. Sometimes we call it the "dandruff to flat feet" pattern. Because literally you can take anything and run it through this pattern and come out with new results. So you can take any symptom, any behavior that someone wants changed, run it through that format, come out with new choices on the other side. Very useful.
Now there's some important presuppositions of six-step reframing too, that I want to alert you to before I demonstrate it. The main one-the main presupposition is that no matter how bizarre, how weird, how crazy, how dumb or stupid anybody's behavior seems including our own, you know. Including-no matter how stupid you think it is and you go, "Boy I wish I didn't do that," that there is some useful, positive purpose to that behavior. That it has some-it has some positive intent. And in fact that you would be worse off without that behavior than with it, if you were just to get rid of the behavior itself-because there's some important, useful purpose to it.
I'll give you several examples to make sure that that idea makes sense. One person that I worked with recently wanted to lose weight. And this person was overeating. In one sense you could think about it as if a part of her was making her overeat when she didn't want to. She thought it was a bad idea. She wanted to lose weight. Now the part of her that really didn't care about overeating that much, what that part really wanted for her was a way of interacting with other people socially, and a way of maintaining her independence. Those were the two things that that part wanted.
It had turned out she had grown up in a somewhat rigid environment. And that was a way that that part figured out to maintain her independence. And it was also a way that that part had figured out to socialize. When you're with people you eat, kind of thing.
So once this person had-or this part had new choices for how to accomplish those goals the overeating wasn't really an issue. That part didn't care about that. And that behavior immediately dropped away. And the person began losing weight.
Another example. A woman came to work with Steve a long time ago-a number of years ago--who had pseudoendometriosis. She'd been diagnosed by a doctor. The doctor had scheduled her for a hysterectomy because the doctor thought that it was extremely serious. She'd put off getting one for a long time. Thought it was extremely serious, too much bleeding and so on. She had high blood pressure that they assumed was partially a result of this. And the doctor thought it was medically dangerous.
The woman came in. Steve did six-step reframing with her. It turned out that there was a part of her that wanted her-what it wanted for her was to take care of herself. It may not be immediately obvious how that worked in this case. But this woman was a super mom. She took care of anyone available, in general. And she already had at least one kid if not more that she had raised. Now she had begun thinking about having another child and this part of her thought, "No way. This is not good for you. You need to take care of yourself. I'll do anything I have to do to keep you from having a child. I'm not interested. It's not going to work."
And that part did. And it was effective. It in fact did keep her from having a child. Now it wasn't the most convenient way. It wasn't the healthiest way to keep her from having a child, but it did work. So in this case once she got the message from that part "It would be really good for you to take care of yourself now," she-her blood pressure went way down immediately and her other physical symptoms cleared up.
She went in to the doctor. It was kind of funny because she went into the doctor, had her blood pressure taken and it was way, way down. She had it taken on one arm and she didn't believe it. She goes, "Take it on the other arm," right? (laughs) Take it on the other arm. It was still just as low. It was a part of the same body.
So does this make sense to you so far? Do you have any questions about this idea of every behavior even if it seems objectionable, even if it seems weird, or you don't like it, every behavior does have some positive intent.
The next thing that I want to make sure that you're alerted to, is that when we do six-step reframing we use the idea of "parts." I've already been using that. See what response I get, you know. And when I talk about parts I'm not talking about some little person inside of you or me that runs around and does these things. And I'm not talking about a body part. You know, "My kidney made me do it." (laughs)
What we are talking about is a set of behaviors and responses that's organized around a particular behavior or purpose. So with the person who was overeating, it's as if a part of her was making her do it even though she didn't like the idea. It's not that she was 100 percent congruently going "Hey, overeating is what I want to do." It's that one part of her wanted to. Another part didn't. Does that make sense to you? OK. So that's the kind of thing that six-step reframing works with really effectively.
Now without further introduction I would like to demonstrate this for you. So what I need is someone or some ones-who of you are-would be interested in doing this with me? And this is an opportunity-this one I will not have you practice with each other. It just takes a little too long to train it. We usually spend four days going through all of the ins and outs of it, and all of the ifs, ands, or buts and how you deal with all kinds of things that sometimes come up. And then in the process of that you also learn a pretty thorough set of negotiation skills.
So when-I'm not going to actually well-now have you guys do this but I will demonstrate it for you. If you have something like this-any behavior or response, feeling that you have that you don't-it's like a part of you makes you do it, and you don't want to that's the perfect thing for this. You've got one?
ELNA: I decided to quit smoking.
CONNIRAE: Today? Great. Great. Perfect. Good timing.
ELNA: This is a culturally divided issue.
CONNIRAE: Yeah. You can't on airplanes anymore, and all kinds of stuff. (laughs) That's great. And you're Elna. Am I saying it right?
ELNA: Elna.
CONNIRAE: Elna. OK, and we even know what the behavior is. Usually I don't reveal this anyone, so they don't hallucinate too floridly out there. (laughter) It's true. People start making up all kinds of ideas about-about things. But this is fairly straight-forward. So it's as if a part of you has been making you smoke when you don't want to. Is that right?
ELNA: Right. Right.
CONNIRAE: You're a hundred percent consciously-you're a hundred percent ready to do something else.
ELNA: Yes. Yes, I want to quit. And the question has been when.
CONNIRAE: OK.
ELNA: And so when I was driving here today I said today's the day.
CONNIRAE: (laughs) I like that tone of voice. (laughter) That's going to put you a lot closer already. (laughs) Yes. You hear the finality and the commitment in that. That's very nice. And it will be much easier and more graceful for you to do that when that part of you that has been making you smoke today has just so many other choices in reaching your outcomes and reaching that parts outcomes that smoking really is not important. It's not relevant anymore.
ELNA: Right.
CONNIRAE: So that's-that's my goal here. Now I'd like to have that-to make sure that that part of you that has been making you smoke understands certain things before we begin. OK. One is that to remind it-I know that's part been here this morning but I want to remind it that my assumption is that it has been doing something very important and very useful for you by making you smoke. Does that make sense to you too?
ELNA: Yes.
CONNIRAE: You may even have some sense of what that is. I don't know. Often people are not consciously aware of the positive purpose for them-is my experience. And consequently often they don't really appreciate that part of them as much as they would. You know, if we knew the valuable important thing these parts of us were doing for us we would appreciate those parts, and be really glad to have them. Often this hasn't been there and so there's been a sense of almost unnecessary conflict.
So that's what reframing helps us do is-is get more unity between a person's conscious and unconscious once we discover those positive intents. OK, so that part of you has been making you smoke. I also want it to know that my role here is as a consultant. That's the way I think about it. My assumption completely is that part of her knows more about this area of her experience than I ever will.
So that's the part that's going to be making all of the decisions. That's the one that knows even more than her conscious mind knows about this area-about what's important, what that part really needs to make sure happens. OK? All right.
Now what I'm going to do is in a moment ask you to go inside and ask a question. (to the group) And some of you may want to scoot further forward to be able to hear what I'm saying. If you want to sit in the aisles that's OK, as long as your chairs aren't there. Is that right?
CAMERAMAN: Yeah.
CONNIRAE: You could sit on the floor right there if you want. Is this going to work for you guys? The-OK. Because I don't like to yell at people's parts. (laughter) They don't like it. OK. A softer voice. They like that better. Yeah. OK. So in a moment I'm going to have you go inside and ask a question. And you do all you need to do is pay attention to what you see, hear or feel on the inside.
ELNA: OK.
CONNIRAE: OK. Now the question is, "Will the part of me that has been making me smoke communicate with me in consciousness now?" You go inside. Ask that question. Notice what response you get. (pause)
ELNA: OK.
CONNIRAE: OK. Now how do you know it's "Yes"? What did you actually see, hear or feel?
ELNA: Umm. A release. Relaxing.
CONNIRAE: Kind of a relaxing feeling?
ELNA: Yeah. Just sort of like um.
CONNIRAE: (laughs) OK. Now I'm guessing she's right in her interpretation. What I like to do with six-step reframing is get a really unambiguous signal that's out of her conscious control, to be sure that we have direct access to that unconscious part. And we're sure that we're getting what that part wants to let us know not what she consciously hopes that part-or what she consciously hopes that part is telling us.
So you got a release. And where exactly did you get it?
ELNA: In my shoulders.
CONNIRAE: OK. And do you know that-
ELNA: And in my head. My head went-my-I felt like my head went up, and my shoulders went down.
CONNIRAE: OK. Good. So you know that feeling. Yeah. So you know the feeling. And you would recognize it if you had it again?
ELNA: I think so.
CONNIRAE: OK. Good. Now what I'd like you to do is check just really quickly. Can you make yourself have exactly the same kind of feeling-exactly by just consciously trying to make yourself?
(to the group) No. She's not getting it. And here's where sensory acuity comes in too, because I'm watching for what her response is. And I'm nonverbally checking-am I seeing the same thing she's reporting to me. And I agree with her completely. She can't get it back by consciously trying.
OK. Excellent. I want you to go back and thank the part of you for giving you that signal. Because it's really a wonderful thing when you think about it; the part-that a part is willing to communicate with you at all. That to me is really worth thanking your part for. When you've been trying to stomp it out, and get rid of it and all of these kind of things for years, usually for most people. So it's worthy of appreciation. Yeah.
And now so that we're really certain about the meaning of the communication. We want a way for that part to say, "Yes." We want a way for that part to say "No." So that part can tell us either one. Now what I would like to have you have that part do is if that part is indeed saying, "Yes, I will communicate with you in consciousness now," to increase that signal of relaxation of letting go-of release. And if it's saying "No," to actually have you tighten up more.
OK. Go inside and if it's saying, "Yes, I will communicate with you in consciousness now" to relax more. It's meaning. So what's your experience?
ELNA: Yeah. The relaxing is down and up. And the tightening is forward and down. Yeah.
CONNIRAE: Now so did you get both when you went inside?
ELNA: I asked for both and I got one, and then the other.
CONNIRAE: Oh. OK. Excellent. So she asked her part to give her the "Yes" signal now and to give her the "No" signal now. That's excellent. That's good. OK, thank the part again for its clear response. It's nice to let-to give your parts appreciation when they deserve it. And it begins to build a nice rapport between you and your unconscious parts.
OK. Good. Now I have another question for you to ask that part of you. And again what we're going to for is a yes or no answer. That part wants to let you know "Yes," you know when it will signal you-that releasing. And if it says "No," you'll know what you'll get.
The question is, "Will you, the part of me that has been making me smoke, let me know in consciousness what you're positive intention is for me in smoking. Is that clear to you? OK. Shall I repeat it or is that clear?
ELNA: I think I've got it.
CONNIRAE: Yes. I think so. In fact I think she's already getting a response. OK. Yeah. By the way, for those of you who are taking a lot of notes these steps are all in several books-Reframing and Frogs Into Princes. And I will go over them afterwards. So you may as well watch and listen. That's the one thing you can't get from the book. OK. So what did you get?
ELNA: "Yes."
CONNIRAE: (to the group) And how many of you knew that already, that she got a "Yes"? Yeah. Excellent. And I'll like you to thank the part again that it's willing to let you know what its positive intent is for you in smoking, and tell the part to go ahead and let you know now what it is that it's been doing for you all these years by making you smoke. And to take all the time it needs to let you know. You've already got it? Sort-you're not sure?
ELNA: Rebellion.
CONNIRAE: Rebellion. (laughs) Now. OK. Now thank it for that information and ask it what it wants for you that's positive by wanting you to rebel. (pause)
ELNA: I don't know if this answers that question. But it's like a release from limitation.
CONNIRAE: Some kind of release from limitation?
ELNA: Yeah.
CONNIRAE: Oh. And if-now I want you to go back-I think that-I think she's getting it. This makes sense to me. And what I'd like you to do is go back for a little bit more clarification. Tell that part we would really like to understand fully what it's doing for you, so that we can fully appreciate it. Because the more you know about what it's really wanting for you, the more you'll be able to give it really well-deserved appreciation.
So how might that part state what it wants for you in the positive? In other words it wants you freed from limitations. What does it want for you? A sense of freedom? A sense of being able to choose your own direction, or-
ELNA: To get total release, unlimited, and there was something else that-that flew.
CONNIRAE: "That flew"-that flew right through there. OK. Now when you get these messages are these things that you want a part of you to have-to be doing for you?
ELNA: Oh yes.
CONNIRAE: Do these make good sense to you?
ELNA: Oh yeah.
CONNIRAE: OK. Now that's the point at which this step-at which we've achieved the outcome for this step. When we have an outcome-see rebellion she might go well on one hand that sounds great, but on the other hand I don't know. So if we go, "Well what is it doing for you that's positive by doing that," we get to something that's even more valuable for her. It's even more bottom line, that that part will really want to maintain and never give up, and rightfully so. That part's going to go for this. And it's going to hold onto it. And we want it to. She wants it too, right?
ELNA: Right.
CONNIRAE: Yeah. OK. So what I would like you to do is go inside and thank the part for having those outcomes for you-for wanting those things-and just let it know that you appreciate that. Probably haven't done that before. And parts like to be appreciated just like people do. (pause)
CONNIRAE: OK. What happened when you do that?
ELNA: I was very relaxed, and feel good inside.
CONNIRAE: Good. Good. Yes. Now we have unity rather than conflict. Now she and her part are in complete agreement about this. They both want the same thing. Good. Now I have another question for you to ask the part. And again you can ask for a "Yes" signal if the answer is yes-a "No" signal if the answer is no. The question is, "If there were ways for you-this part that has been making you smoke-to achieve its positive purposes for you-its positive outcomes-that this part thinks would work as well or better than smoking-preferably better-would it be interested?
ELNA: Again?
CONNIRAE: If there were ways that this part thought would work as well or better than smoking to reach exactly the outcomes that part wants would it be interested? (pause)
Now what do you get?
ELNA: I get "Yes."
CONNIRAE: OK. Now is it clear? Is it a clear yes?
ELNA: Yes once I got through the question. Usually- it was like I just froze up. (laughs)
CONNIRAE: OK. Good. Good. Great. And you always need to be clear on this step that it's-that that part is going to be the one deciding. It's only if that part because that part does know a lot more than I can ever hope to about this whole area and what's going to work for her or what won't. So it's only if that part thinks it's going to be better, that that part's going to be interested in going for something else.
OK. And it makes good sense. I mean if you're just offered a better way to get exactly what you want, you're going to take it and so will her part. OK. Good. Now are you already aware of a creative part of yourself?
ELNA: Yes.
CONNIRAE: Good. What I'd like you to do then is go inside. And I'm going to give you a set of instructions. It's going to be a little bit longer, so you can just either repeat them to yourself or just let your parts listen directly to me and go ahead and begin.
ELNA: OK.
CONNIRAE: OK. That's right. Now what you can allow to happen-you can have your part that has been making you smoke that wants this kind of freedom-whatever you might call it-but wants these positive purposes for you-have this part go to your creative part. And let your creative part know-either consciously or unconsciously, I really don't care which-fully what your part's positive purposes are for you.
Now once your creative part understands this fully, your creative part will do what it does best-what it likes to do-namely begin to generate lots of new possibilities for how to achieve that same outcome-that same positive purpose.
Now some of these ways are going to be wonderful. Some of them are going to be mediocre. And some of them are going to be lousy. It doesn't really matter, because the creative part's job is just to develop ideas-generate ideas.
Now once your creative part has generated the idea-each idea, the part that has been making you smoke-that has made you smoke-is going to evaluate them. And either go, "Yes, this will work as well or better than smoking to achieve my outcomes" or "No, it's not quite as good-not good enough. Each time the part of you that used to make you smoke gets one that it likes as well or better than smoking I want that part to give you a "Yes" signal-a definite "Yes" signal-so that you'll know you have one method. And that way you'll know even if the communication happens at the unconscious level; you'll get an unambiguous signal that "Yes, I've got a method now that I like as well or better than smoking to achieve my positive purpose." Now, do you understand?
ELNA: Yes.
CONNIRAE: Good. Since this is something like smoking I'm going to suggestion one additional thing. And that is that your part select also for alternatives that are as immediate as smoking. So methods that work as well or better in achieving the positive outcome and that are as immediate. When you have three "Yes" signals-that you've got that, let me know.
And now we'll just give her a little time to let her unconscious creative part generate lots of new alternatives and to allow the part that had been making her smoke select from them. (pause)
CONNIRAE: Good. You got three already?
ELNA: Yes.
CONNIRAE: OK. Quick parts in there.
ELNA: I-one that I intellectually thought was going to be good was rejected.
CONNIRAE: Good. That's a good sign. (laughter) Yes. OK. So are you consciously aware of the three new choices, or not?
ELNA: Yes.
CONNIRAE: OK. Great. And it doesn't really matter. Sometimes people are. Sometimes they're not. Either way is fine. OK. The next question that I want you to ask on the inside-she's got these three new choices now-well actually this part does-that it thinks will work as well or better than smoking to achieve exactly what the part wants.
The next step is go inside and ask this question, and notice a "Yes" or "No" response. "Will you-this part of me-take responsibility and actually try out-actually use these new choices-in the appropriate context in the future in the next several weeks? (Elna's nonverbal "Yes" response is obvious) That's fairly unambiguous-fairly clear. Excellent. Excellent. So go back inside and thank your part again. And thank your creative part too for its contribution-important contribution.
Great. Now another-now we're going to do an ecological check. Now the part of her that wants-how would you state the outcome in one word? Wants freedom? Wants the positive purpose-or phrase?
ELNA: Breaks.
CONNIRAE: Wants breaks?
ELNA: Breaks. That would be it.
CONNIRAE: OK. So the part of her that wants breaks now has a number of ways to do it that it likes. It's happy. You can see that (in Elna's nonverbal response. (laughs) What we want to be sure of now is just make sure as a double checking that these ways are also satisfying to the rest of her-to her as a complete being. So I want you to go inside and ask of all of your other parts-is there any part of me that has any objection whatsoever to any of the three new choices? And notice if you get any response. (pause)
ELNA: If anything I get a "No."
CONNIRAE: OK. (laughs)
ELNA: Yeah. It was kind of like-
CONNIRAE: Uh-huh. So. But see anything, hear anything or feel?
ELNA: No.
CONNIRAE: OK. Good. Good. And she looks completely congruent. I'm checking at this point for nonverbal congruence, and do I need to push further because if there were a part, I would really want to know that right now. Now's the time to find out because what that would mean is that there was another outcome that also needed to be taken into account here to get solutions that we're really going to be working for. She's got that already. So great.
Now I'm going to have you do one additional thing. And that's sort of an extra future-pace. So go inside and give your unconscious part that wants you to have ways to take breaks an opportunity to go through an additional "dress rehearsal." So to give you the experience-the full experience, either consciously or unconsciously, of actually utilizing one of these new choices in the appropriate situation in the future. And when you're done you can let me know. (pause)
CONNIRAE: Great. (laughs) Now I really wouldn't mind if your unconscious did that while you were sleeping tonight. Just for the fun of it.
ELNA: OK.
CONNIRAE: Just to make sure that's fully wired in and totally automatically, easily comfortably available to you in the future. OK. We are now done.
ELNA: That's great.
CONNIRAE: Enjoy.
ELNA: Thank you. I will.
CONNIRAE: I can see that. (laughter) Good. OK. And well, actually before you sit down, does anyone have any questions of her? No? OK. Thank you.
PARTICIPANT: Can you do it by yourself? I mean do you have to have someone to ask you all of the questions?
CONNIRAE: I've done it with myself many times. No problem. Now often it's easier to have someone guide you through it-unless you're real familiar with it-is what we've found. So we usually-the sequence that works best for most of the people that we've trained is to have them do it with each other a lot of times and pretty soon-what happens then is that you do wire in that way of thinking. It becomes automatic to you. The program itself becomes a part of the way you experience the world.
We used to try to teach six-step reframing in a two-day weekend. And we thought we were doing it for a while. And then we realized we weren't getting-we weren't getting much across. So now we do it over four days and in a very carefully thought-out sequence where you get certain small steps first. And they build on each other, and by the time you do six-step reframing it's all-it's almost all in your behavior already.
The nice thing about reframing is that there's always another way to go. It doesn't matter if you get "Nos" anywhere along the line. There's always something else to do. And by doing a careful set-up, I make it fairly unlikely that I'm going to get "Nos." "No's" usually come out of some kind of misunderstanding, and I need to make something clear. As long as I've carefully set this up ahead of time that rarely happens.
So that's the point for doing the Japanese soldier metaphor. That's the point for giving you a few examples ahead of time. That's the point for giving you in advance several presuppositions about reframing. I could have started this without any of that. And it would have worked just fine. I would have just got "Nos" several points along the way. And I would have needed to make some of those points in the process. You can do it either way-either way.
Now before I get into the specific steps I'd like to ask you a question. "What happens-what would happen if you do six-step reframing with someone. And they went out and they used their three new choices and suddenly they found they were using their old behavior again? What do you do?" You go, "Oh, it didn't work. I knew it wouldn't work. Nothing works. Nothing ever works." Or you go, "Well, reframing is bad or-" What?
PARTICIPANT: Does it take time to process it for it to take over?
CONNIRAE: Generally not. It's generally immediate that you get that. That's a good idea. Yeah?
PARTICIPANT: You can ask that part why it didn't work.
CONNIRAE: Well, go back and get some more information is-is the direction I think you're going in there. And I agree completely. See when you think about it, if a part goes out-if a part has been using one choice for 5 years, 10 years, 20 years-sometimes more, how much does the part know about what works and doesn't work to achieve the certain positive outcome? It knows about one thing. That's it.
Now if you send that part out with three new choices that it thinks are going to work in its best guess, knowing all that it knows-thinks they're going to work, then that part tries them and goes, "Well, hey, I guess I was wrong. These don't really work as well as I thought. I think I like the old one better." And it does those again. That part now is in a position of having four times the information that it had earlier.
So it means that you're in a position to go back and do reframing again. Go, "OK with what you know now, let's go back. Let's get some more choices that are a lot more satisfactory, given all of the new data you've got." And that part is much more apt to be accurate about getting three choices at that point.
Now usually people-people's parts-guess correctly the first time anyway. They do get-they do get methods that work. In case they don't, you've always got that to go back to. Just go back and get new choices. Yeah?
PARTICIPANT: Could you say something more about parts? I mean is it-it's not immediately obvious to me that there are parts-separate parts.
CONNIRAE: Yeah. Yeah. And there aren't. It's just a way of talking. It's a way of organizing someone's thinking so that you can communicate with the set of experiences that is in charge here. Because she probably has wanted to stop smoking before. Is that right?
ELNA: Right.
CONNIRAE: So conscious-it's not like her whole person was going, "Hey, smoking-I love it." Her conscious mind was going, "I don't like this idea. I know it's not healthy. You know I'm not really so thrilled about this." But it's as if a part of her was going, "Wait a minute, it's the best way I know to take breaks."
PARTICIPANT: So you're not encouraging your psyche to break up into parts. You are-you're dealing with parts that have already splintered into some disagreement?
CONNIRAE: Exactly. Yeah. It's exactly-that's exactly it. You can think about it this way. We all have-in living, we've all got multiple outcomes. There are a lot of things that human beings want, to live a happy, satisfying life. So you know you want some-there are things about relationships. There are things about-satisfaction, about asense of competence that most people have. They have those kind of outcomes. I want to be able to do something well. There are outcomes about well-being and happiness. And there are lots of other outcomes that most of us have as human beings.
Now if someone perceived a particular outcome like taking a break and the only-the only behavior that they knew to get it was smoking or eating or whatever, then the person would be perceiving this outcome-which is kind of a part of well-being-as being in conflict with another one which might be health. Now if you're focused on the behavior, smoking-and stopping the behavior itself, then you're in conflict. Because you go behavior-"Well, I want to smoke because it gives me a break, but I don't want to smoke because it violates my health concerns." Now if you get back up to the outcome level and go, "Well, I want to be able to take a break. And I want to do things that are good for my health. Are those in conflict? Absolutely not. Not at all.
So reframing gives you a way of getting back to the outcomes where there isn't conflict. And then from there generating new behaviors off of that. So you start with a behavior that someone complains about. You go up to the outcome. Then you come down with three new behaviors that are better-you know, that work better to get your same outcome. That's another way of thinking about it-about what you're doing with reframing.
Now once you've got these new choices that work better, why would you want to do something that didn't work as well to get exactly what you want? So reframing is a format for change without struggle. Does that make sense? OK.
There's something else that I want to comment on about reframing, that I think is way more important than any specific solution-because a lot of people have gotten a lot of specific solutions with reframing. To me more-there's something more important than that about it. And that is that it trains people to think about all of their "behaviors" and "symptoms" as positive-rather than to fight with themselves. And that's what's really useful about reframing.
PARTICIPANT: Acknowledging ourselves.
CONNIRAE: Yeah. Yeah. Because a lot of people go. "Well, you know, I have this feeling and I shouldn't have it. You know, I feel angry or I feel-have one of these feeling and I really shouldn't have it." What reframing begins to train people to do is go, "Oh this feeling is a signal for something that's valuable, for something that's important for me. Maybe there's a way. Maybe there's another behavior that I can have instead of it that will actually work better. But we recognize and value the signal for what it is-for its useful purpose rather than being in conflict about it. Make sense? OK.
PARTICIPANT: Can you do this externally with people?
CONNIRAE: Yes.
PARTICIPANT: Think positive. You're not really trying to compete.
CONNIRAE: Exactly. It overlaps to dealing with other people. And that's where this leads to a good negotiation format. Because with other people you start going, "What's their positive outcome?" Different people can be treated exactly the same as different parts of the same person. Once you've-I get your outcomes and your outcomes and my outcomes-at the level of outcomes we're going to be in agreement. And once we get to that agreement we can figure out solutions that satisfy all of the outcomes. It's a little more complicated than that, but that's a real important basic first step. Yeah?
 
ELNA: I had a comment in hearing you speak about this now. The answer that I got for what the behavior was accomplishing-I did not understand at the time. It's only now that I have sat down and thought back over it that I understand what that meant. And when I finally came up with "breaks" that was what that meant. Because I was saying relaxation and release and freedom and all of that stuff, and it didn't make any sense to me. I don't know if it did to anybody else or not.
CONNIRAE: Did to me, but- (laughs) Yeah.
ELNA: But it makes me aware that that came through then eventually to my consciousness.
CONNIRAE: That's-that's a nice report. I appreciate that. And when you get that kind of report-when I get that, I trust it much more than if the person goes, "Oh yeah, it's telling me what I always thought." Then I go, "I think there's something else. I think there's probably something even more important that that part is doing for you."
Usually it is new information, because usually if the person were already thinking at the outcome level they would not be in conflict. They would have already figured out new solutions that would work better. So thanks-thanks for that response. Yes?
PARTICIPANT: We have now seen an indication of how this would work with the behavior such as smoking. And you indicated overeating, and I've heard of using this for phobias and things like that.
CONNIRAE: Not really for phobias. You don't want to do that.
PARTICIPANT: No. OK. Well in person what does this work well for? You know, what kind of-are we talking about someone that has temper tantrums or a-personal things that we each have that are more behavioral? Smoking to me is an instinctive behavior-
CONNIRAE: Behavior. A habit.
PARTICIPANT: A habit. What other kinds of things might this be useful for?
CONNIRAE: I will list some things. About the only thing that comes to mind that I could-wouldn't use it for or couldn't is-you could even with phobias but I wouldn't. The reason you don't use it for phobias is because the signal usually is the phobic response, which is too overwhelming. You don't want it. You don't want the person to have to experience that.
PARTICIPANT: OK.
CONNIRAE: It's just not-and it's not necessary. There's a faster way with phobias. So some things there are faster ways with. But this will work with almost anything. So things that come to mind immediately. Some things that are ideal, are where the signal itself is the behavior-the thing somebody doesn't like. Something like migraine headaches where it's out of consciousness. You don't get a lot of conscious information. So if you sit down with this person and go what's the positive intent of your headaches? They're not going to have a clue. That's the kind of thing where it gives you a way of getting access to the unconscious without having to go through somebody's cognitive ability to understand.
So things that already have physical symptoms are perfect. And I've used it on just about everything. I've used it-some things that come to mind are a guy who wanted to be more assertive with women, and something stopped him. He would clam up every time a woman came along who was attractive to him. And I did this with him. It worked really well.
And it's kind of interesting with this particular guy too, because he didn't get any conscious communication. We did the whole thing unconsciously. He had no idea what the positive intent was. He had no idea what his new choices were going to be at the end of it. All he or I knew were that he was getting signals. And that at the end of it, his part was signaling us, "Yes I do have three new ways-three new choices."
Now that's all we knew. Now if I hadn't already done it with a lot of people I would have been real skeptical that anything was happening. (laughs) But I could see by the nonverbal responses that he was in fact moving through the format and reorganizing himself.
So several weeks later I talked to him again and I was real curious what had happened. I sai, "What went on?" And he said, "Oh, it was really interesting because I would get in the situation where there was a woman I was interested in and I got this really loud voice on the inside that said "Go over there and say this." (laughter) He had this Gestapo voice that just ordered him around. And he did it! (laughter) Whatever the voice said, he did. Now it's kind of funny in one way. It's not what I would have chosen, but it worked for him. And it got him his outcome.
PARTICIPANT: With that example you just gave, what was the positive outcome of not approaching women?
CONNIRAE: I never found that out. And I don't know if he even did. Sometimes parts don't like to tell you stuff. (laughs) I've had a few of those things. Once I was doing this with myself. I was doing six-step reframing with myself and going through the format. Because I was in a bad state and I didn't like it. I have this feeling. Don't want this feeling. We'll do six-step reframing.
So I was going through the steps and got to the step where it goe, "Will you communicate with me in consciousness?" I guess that's right at the beginning. Isn't it? And I got this really loud voice that says, "No." (laughs) I thought "Oh, OK. I trust this as a signal from my unconscious." I don't usually get that obvious a signal. But that one was totally obvious. No question about did I make that up!
So I said OK. OK. We don't have to. But I'm curious what you're objection is. And the same voice came in and said, "Because you wouldn't listen anyway." (laughter)
I thought "Oh. (laughs) Well, OK" Now at the time I kind of thought well this part doesn't understand me very well; I would listen. But when I thought about it later-see what actually happened is about 30 seconds later my unconscious had run through the process; that's all of the time that it took. I felt fine. I had new choices. I had no idea what they were. I had no idea what the positive intent was. I just felt better.
And that took maybe one or two minutes. When I looked back on it, I realized if I had tried to do that and get conscious information at every step I would have still been there two hours later in this case. And in a sense that part of me was right, because I would have gotten messages and then said, "Well are you sure? Is that really what you mean? Is this really a signal from my unconscious?" I would have done that too much. My part knew me better than I did myself and goes, "Forget this. We're going to do it unconsciously." So sometimes it works better that way.
PARTICIPANT: If you're doing it with yourself and you're not getting clear answers how can you check to be sure that it's really taking, or working, or whatever?
CONNIRAE: There's several ways. One good way is to have somebody else work with you. Because that way-see I sometimes have done this where the person had no idea what the signal was. Here everything was out of consciousness even including the signal. I was watching the signal from the outside. I could see a shift. And it was clear enough that I was-that I could read the "Yeses" and the "Nos" unambiguously.
PARTICIPANT So if you're trying to do it with yourself and not getting clear responses you might be better with someone else?
CONNIRAE: Yes. Yes. Where they can watch from the outside. Another thing that you can do if you're not getting clear signals-often that's an indication that you haven't built rapport yet with your unconscious well enough. And overall I like the idea of building better rapport, so you do get information from your unconscious and you do know what that part wants for you, especially you know that; whether you know the new choices is less important I think.
And once you build a rapport with your unconscious, your unconscious is a lot more willing to let you in on all of this stuff-your different parts. Does that make sense? If the part goes, "This person's going to screw me over and misinterpret me; I'm not going to tell it anything." Whereas if the part goes, "Oh this person is going to respect me-it's going to treat me well if I let it know things, and in fact it's going to appreciate me a lot more," then it's more apt to let you know things.
Now one way to do that is to go inside and apologize. It works with people; it works with parts. So if you're not getting a response at all you can go inside and go, "I want to apologize for the way I have treated you over all of these years. I have been totally unaware that you were doing something useful for me. And I'm really sorry about that because that lack of knowledge on my part led me to try to stomp you out, and do all kinds of things that were obnoxious. And I'm not surprised that you're more than a little annoyed. So I want to apologize completely and invite-let you know that at this point I am receptive and I do understand that you're doing something useful for me." So do whatever it takes to get back rapport, is one approach.
Sometimes when people don't get signals it's more a matter of being overly-what we technically call overly conscious mind about it. (laughs) Or having a real-a certain convincer strategy where-this was the case for me. It takes a lot of examples for me to get convinced of something.
So when I learned NLP I wasn't convinced the first time I saw a demonstration. I had to see it work over and over and over again before I got convinced. And sometimes people are like that with their unconscious signals. They have to-it has to be obvious over and over. By this time your parts are getting bored. They're getting a little annoyed. So that's when it can be helpful to have another person there.
And for myself I learned to take the attitude that I would go with what I had. I would go with the signals I had. The worst that would happen is nothing. The best that would happen is that I had three new choices, and a lot.
Some time-I can think of another-a number of examples where I was working with people on fairly serious matters where I thought they ought to get signals all of the way. You know each day if something came up they'd want immediate feedback from that part. So we sat up a signal system-a way that that part could alert them that they really needed to do something, and get their attention without having to use some kind of counterproductive signal. So to give the part a positive signal. So it might be that they would literally see a red flag go up. Or they might hear a little siren go off. You know "Alert, alert, pay attention to this," whatever would work to get that person's attention. And they will often know better you. So I leave it to that part and the person's unconscious. And I don't tell-I would tell the part, "Look, if the person doesn't pay attention, you go back and use your other signal. If they don't respond to the nice one, use the other one." (laughs) That way they've got a deal. They're more motivated to respond to the nice one. Yes?
PARTICIPANT: Can you use this with the mentally ill, like <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span>-people that are?
CONNIRAE: People that are what? Hallucinating floridly and all of this kind of stuff.
PARTICIPANT: Well yes.
CONNIRAE: You can. And it's probably not going to be the only thing you need to do. But if it's-it can be really useful when you have-often when people are hallucinating it's split off parts of themselves-even more extreme then what we're talking here. If I'm hearing voices out of the wall plugs, giving me instructions to do things, now that's a real disassociated part. It's a real separated part of me that's making me do something that I don't want to do. So six-step reframing can be a really useful way of going for "What's the positive-what does that voice want for you?" And if it's a voice it's great because if it knows how to talk to you already-"Just listen to the wall plug and it'll tell you what it wants," you know. (laughter)
So yeah. Then to get back to the thing about parts-what ends up happening with this is more of a unification. The person begins to become a whole person, rather than as split off-split apart, incongruent.
PARTICIPANT: So whatever's the message, does each part set up its own signal? You set up this first signal of straightening up with that part; could another part wind up using that same signal or-
CONNIRAE: It could.
PARTICIPANT: Is it up to them? I mean it's up to the parts, basically what they're-what signal they're-
CONNIRAE: We-yeah. In NLP the approach is to let the part choose its own signal. And what that accomplishes is that it saves you usually about six sessions. Because- maybe not, depending on the person, sometimes less, sometimes more-but if you have to take the time to set up lots of arbitrary signals and get the part to use them, that's a lot more work. If you let the part use whatever is easy for the part to do already, it just saves a lot of time. And I'm much more convinced I'm really getting a communication from the part.
Usually the signal that you get is in fact related to the behavior that the person is dealing with. So when-usually if-you know, somebody is dealing with stage fright-the part of me that makes me get butterflies in my stomach-often the signal will be the butterflies. Or if it's a migraine the best signal is the headache itself. You know you're talking to the right part if you get that. And you know you're dealing with something that's outside their conscious control.
I would like add a reminder here, if it's not already obvious that with-when you're dealing with anything physical including migraines, I also suggest that you, or anyone you work with, be under a doctor's supervision for your and their safety. That that's an important part of it. Occasionally it-or I don't know, I don't know how occasionally, sometimes someone will come in and want to work on a physical symptom.
I have one-an example that comes to mind, a woman who wanted to work with a particular symptom. She also had endometriosis. In this case the six-step reframing did not cure the endometriosis. Now she went to a doctor. And I made sure she was doing that, too. I didn't want to take any chances here. I want her to get all of the care and use all of the resources that she's got available to her. She discovered some time later after going through a whole bunch of doctors that she had a Vitamin K deficiency. When-once she took that, her endometriosis cleared up.
Now I don't understand medically exactly how that worked. And I understand that it's a particularly unique situation with her. It was her. It's not everybody with endometriosis that has that physical problem. But it turned out the Vitamin K did it. Six-step reframing did not.
However, in the process of doing six-step reframing with her, she revamped her life in a lot of useful ways. So even if it is something where someone gets some useful medical input. This woman also got-the positive intent I got was about taking care of herself-often with physical symptoms it is. It has something to do with that. Take better care of yourself. And she got a bunch of new choices; like every morning-one of her new choices was every morning to do reframing. Her part wanted her to do that. Every morning go inside, check it and find out what her parts wanted her to do that day to take care of herself. And then she had a number of others.
So she really liked that. It was really useful. And the medical part was also very important. People have utilized this with a variety of other physical illnesses, and sometimes gotten "spontaneous remissions" or whatever happened. Often if it's serious, they'll do other things along with it because you know if a person has something serious they want to try everything they've got available to them. Yeah?
PARTICIPANT: I mean I feel stupid for asking this but why does this seem so easy?
CONNIRAE: It is.
PARTICIPANT: You know, when you think about things that people struggle with all of their lives and probably have-they're just going to-well I guess it's kind of like you know, "Why don't they teach this to people in first grade?"
CONNIRAE: Yeah. I had that question. Yeah. And the way I think about that-it's a good question I think. Did you hear that? He goes, "Why does it seem so easy?" You know why doesn't-"If it's so easy, kind of why aren't we all doing this all of the time?"
The way I think about it is that when you do-NLP teaches people the structure of experience and then real specific ways of thinking about what needs to happen to make the resolution easy. When you know what the key is to making a shift, it is easy. It's only when you're trying to use the-an incorrect, inappropriate solution that change is hard.
Think about that in your own life. You've made a lot of changes easily, haven't you? I mean are you the same person you are-were when you were one and a half? You've made lots of changes. Most of them were easy. It's only the ones that people were trying inappropriate solutions or somehow the solution was a mismatch for the difficulty. What?
PARTICIPANT: It's our belief. We've been taught that it's not easy to make a change.
CONNIRAE: Yeah. Yeah.
PARTICIPANT: That's not-that's not what I was saying though. I guess what I fear-my fear, my objection is that- You know, I'm real complicated inside. And I won't be able to get a clear signal. I think that's kind of-that's you know what I mean. I watch this and it seems, "OK. This is kind of a neat little parlor trick." And you know their finger jerks and that's, you know, they get the answer.
CONNIRAE: (laughs) Yeah. Yeah.
PARTICIPANT: But it's the-maybe that's why I-I'm skeptical but still you know I look for things. I mean I'm looking for things that work.
CONNIRAE: Yeah. Yeah. And I think it is wise to be skeptical. I am when I go-like I told you I'm not convinced ever by one demonstration (laughs) of anything personally.
So what I go for-what I did with reframing when I learned that, I thought, "This is weird, you know." I thought it was very strange even weirder eye accessing cures. I went out and did it with all my clients. I did. I pretended as if it was going to work. I did it and found out what happened. And it worked, with most of them-not with everybody on everything the first time. And I also learned I got a lot better at it. I learned how to handle objections and how to deal with obstacles. But that's the final convincer.
Now for me personally I was the last one I tried it on. It's not that I necessarily recommend that. But that-I mean that's more just my own personal history-but I knew I would be more successful first with other people. So I was going to do it that way.
Other people find it easiest to begin with themselves. And certainly I think that's wonderful, because then you get the benefits for yourself right away. So I think the time to be convinced is after you've had enough experiences to be, and no sooner. So I can't go, Well, you ought to be convinced now. That's not what I think.
I do think though that it-even if it is a parlor game-as long as it gets people new experiences, new choices, it helps them-if it helps a lot of people get over smoking it's a good parlor game as far as I'm concerned. And I wish it went on in more parlors.
Follow-up Interview
CONNIRAE: Before you observe the follow-up interview I'd like to comment that Elna responded very quickly to each step of the process. This has to do both with the way I framed it, and with Elna's responsiveness. Even when six-step reframing takes a little longer, you can get excellent results.
CONNIRAE: It's been a little over three months since the introductory workshop where we did reframing on your outcome to stop smoking.
ELNA: Right.
CONNIRAE: And I'd like to ask you about what the results were.
ELNA: Well, really fantastic. I haven't had a cigarette since.
CONNIRAE: Great. That sounds good.
ELNA: And it has been amazingly easy.
CONNIRAE: Good.
ELNA: I have not had what you would generally consider to be problems with quitting smoking. I have not lost weight, although I have wanting to. I'm in Weight Watchers and trying to. And I've been just staying steady. But I thought that was good because so many people gain quite a lot of weight when they quit smoking. And it's always been a fear of mine.
CONNIRAE: Yeah.
ELNA: It was one of the things that kept me smoking, was that I was afraid that I would gain a lot of weight. So I've stayed the same for these whole three months.
CONNIRAE: Great. Great.
ELNA: And I have not really craved cigarettes. There've been times where I wished I had one, but you know it's not been hard. None of it was hard. The one other thing I'll just mention on that is that I got an unexpected bonus. And that is that I enjoy being around cigarette smoke.
CONNIRAE: Oh yeah. That's really nice.
ELNA: Which I had no idea that would happen. And it never has been true for me before. Even when I smoked I didn't like being around cigarette smoke.
CONNIRAE: Oh.
ELNA: But now I like to hang out with the people who smoke on breaks and just sometimes just like to be around smoke, which is a tremendous gift.
CONNIRAE: Yeah. For social reasons that can be nice.
ELNA: Right.
CONNIRAE: Your friends smoke and so on-or some of them do. Great. That all sounds really good. I wanted to ask you how much did you smoke before?
ELNA: Well I-I had been smoking for more than 25 years. And there was a time where I smoked 1 to 2 packages a day. That was a long time ago. Over the last 10 to 15 years I had gradually diminished to where I just smoked a few cigarettes a day but I had never for any extended period of time completely given it up.
I had always thought that I could just smoke situationally and socially, which is what I wanted to do. And what would happen is that I would cut way back and do that for a while, and then gradually build back up again because I had never quit.
CONNIRAE: OK. So this time you quit.
ELNA: So. I quit. For good.
CONNIRAE: Great. Great. Sounds good. Now do you-are there any other responses that you noticed, or shifts? You already mentioned a few of them. That may be it.
ELNA: I've told a lot of people about it, because I've been really excited about it. It's sort of been, "Oh yes, and I've quit smoking now," You know? And I like to tell people that. I have tried to-in my enthusiasm-get other people that smoke that wanted to quit to try the six-step reframing. And I've explained to them from my notes how to do that.
No one has done that, although a couple of people have reduced their amount of smoking. I haven't tried-I did try on one friend to do it, and-
CONNIRAE: Well maybe they'll watch this videotape now.
ELNA: Yeah. (laughter)
CONNIRAE: Have an easier way.
ELNA: I do think that it was key that I was really ready to stop. I had had in mind for some period of time that I wanted to stop. What happened that particular day-maybe you'd like to hear just a little bit about my perception of what happened. This was the second day of the workshop. I-I was not highly invested in the workshop at the time that I went. I had things-a whole lot of things had changed since I'd signed up for it. And I was starting a new career and you know. I was just-my mind was on other things.
And so I was just sort of being there. And I was interested in the material, but I wasn't really involved in it, until that morning when you asked for a volunteer. And I found myself raising my hand, saying, "Sure I'll do this," you know in front of the video camera. (laughs) And I was really surprised at myself. And it was just so easy. And I-and it was just great.
I had no idea what you were going to do. But I really felt a trust in you; I felt very comfortable with you. And it was-it wasn't scary to me to do that. And now-
CONNIRAE: Great. Great.
ELNA: I had just on the way that morning driving the hour or so that it took me to get there, I thought, "I'm just going to quit smoking now." And that didn't even connect until you asked for a volunteer. And I thought "OK, this is me. I'm wanting to change a behavior. Yeah. This is a behavior I want to change."
CONNIRAE: Yeah. Great. Great. You did seem very much ready and very much there for that process.
ELNA: Yeah.
CONNIRAE: OK. Well I want to thank you again, and wish you continued enjoyment of this shift.
ELNA: Thank you. Thank you.
CONNIRAE: It sounds like weight loss will be the next one. (laughs)
ELNA: Yes. I would like that.
CONNIRAE: All right.
ELNA: And I thank you, because that was just a very joyful experience for me to have it this way.
CONNIRAE: Good.
ELNA: As easy as possible I think.
CONNIRAE: Great.
After the follow up interview Elna asked to watch the videotape of her session. While watching, she mentioned additional information we both thought was interesting. She commented that at the time-and even now-the reframing process seemed almost too easy to her.
More interesting, Elna said that all three of the new choices she'd gotten through reframing were not ones that she had thought of consciously before that. In fact one of them was the opposite of what she'd expected would work. Her new choices were reading something funny, playing music, and getting away from people. Consciously she had thought socializing more would be a good new choice. However her unconscious part let her know she needed to do the exact opposite.
Right after the reframing session Elna bought a joke book and carried it around. She also carried around a pack of cigarettes for close to a month when she finally threw it out. More recently she started a job working around many smokers. At first she was concerned that she would start smoking again, but she says she hasn't been seriously tempted.
