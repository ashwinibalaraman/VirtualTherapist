The greater the number of intimate relationships
we have, the more life is revealed to us.
Through the expression of our amorous desires
we multiply our most valuable insights ... our
prides are challenged, our imaginations educated,
our discriminations given a sharper edge;
and above all we become more tough towards
ourselves, more tender towards others.


<i>Wheels on Gravel</i>, Alyse Gregory


THE THEME is love. If I were at this point to print the opening
bars of Schubert&apos;s G major string quartet, I suppose that this
would be as incomprehensible to most of my readers as if I had
filled the page with Chinese characters. Yet I think it might
be easier to define love in musical notation--Wagner achieved
it--than in words. This quartet, with its torrential outpouring
of strange harmonies, with its sudden pauses and hesitations
and silences; with its rapid opening crescendo, the chords
abrupt, forceful, as though they could hardly contain all that
has to be said; the tune of the first theme mounting the tremolando
harmonies; the savage climax followed by the sweet,
rocking tranquillity of the second theme, which bears above it
a delicate quivering descant as of fingers playing over bare
skin; the music climbing again and again to ecstasy, to sink at
last to rest--there can be no more perfect expression of the
comprehensiveness of love, running as it does the whole gamut
between the poles of desire and tenderness; no better mirror of
love&apos;s creativeness, perpetually renewing itself at the source of
its own central theme; playing upon it with infinite variation.


The musical analogy cannot be taken further than this,
however. The course of experience--tentative, empirical, often
chaotic--is far removed from the logic of musical form. Only

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Reality exists only in that instant that it is enacted. After
that, it is immediately modified by a host of afterthoughts,
impressions, inaccuracies, even perversions. I attempt vainly to
hold on to any one particular moment, to return to it and
recapture its mood or feeling, but the reality of it has already
been absorbed into the next, and I am myself changed.


How can one recapture that overwhelming sense of total
involvement when the heart cried: ‘I love!’? We have ourselves
gone as much as the moment.


What have I sought for? What have I found in love?
I consider soberly this second movement, and I ask myself:
surely from a life which has contained much loving, however
crassly it was conducted, however brief its term, it should be
possible to draw out some quintessence of meaning, personal to
myself, on this subject? Where do I begin?


When I was a child, I wanted to love, but I did not find it
easy. My brothers were so much older than I was that they
seemed young men and rather alarming. My mother I loved
in some ways and hated in others. She was kind but her
affection encroached upon me, wanted too much in return, as
though she were determined to extract from me, her last child,
the utmost that she could. I was relieved to escape from her to
the world of boarding-school.


My father I loved and admired. I used to long for his letters,
and read them again and again. I kept them for years and wish
I had them still, for he was a good letter-writer. When I was
about fifteen, at an age when I could have enjoyed his
companionship which I had experienced all too little on the
long walks we used to take, he withdrew from me and the

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My father had an enormous sense of humour and would
have enjoyed the macabre, Dickensian scene provoked by his
death. He had a series of strokes and my mother and the family
were summoned by his mistress. We arrived on a bitterly cold
January morning, our breath steaming. She flung open the
door upon the burly ranks of her lover&apos;s family, standing in
stony silence outside her front door.


‘He&apos;s just gone!’ she sobbed hysterically, and seizing my
mother&apos;s unwilling hand, she dragged her into the house,
crying: ‘Come and touch him! He&apos;s still warm!’


The rest of us tramped gloomily up and down the frosty
garden between the brown stalks of michaelmas daisies and
golden rod.


This event occurred during the war years, when I was
already grown-up. In my &apos;teens, starved of the opportunity of
loving, it was fairly obvious that I should fall for one of the
mistresses at my school, and so I did, an experience hardly
remarkable, for it happens to many adolescent girls. I escaped
from school, from the schoolmistress, and from home, at one
and the same time, but ‘escape’ is too positive a word, perhaps.
I was really in headlong flight and I had no idea where I was
going. I placed all my hopes upon my next port of refuge, the
university, but unhappily I did not notice much difference
between my residential college and boarding-school, except
that the former was far more disagreeable than the latter, and
more lacking in freedom; more childish in its standards and

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Only a month before I entered my first term at the university,
my parents&apos; marriage had finally broken up. I had no
home. My mother, whom I did not like and was angrily sorry
for, was lent a small, damp cottage, and I joined her during
the vacations. I found myself living in a kind of limbo, which
I crossed at intervals to take up residence either in the cottage
or college, both equally alien and unreal. Mildewed walls,
fungus sprouting from the wainscot, brown linoleum clouded
with damp on the floors, and virtual solitude since I did not
want my mother&apos;s companionship. Or--for longer periods--
the pitch-pine, impersonal furniture of my college room, the
hive of students buzzing round my ears, most of them away
from home for the first time and revelling in it. For my part, I
was looking for freedom after years of boarding-school life, and
found nothing but pettifogging rules and ludicrous undergraduate
‘traditions’, invented, for there <i>was</i> no tradition--
while my mind was suddenly confined by booklists of books
that I had either read, or had no inclination to read. I was
utterly dismayed by my first university year and had the
appalling sensation of travelling rapidly backwards chased by a
pack of pedant-hounds, their ears all too surely sweeping away
the freshness of the morning dew, while their throats bayed:
‘You must not read this, that or the other. He is not in the

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had never been driven in upon myself before, and I was
quite unprepared for what I found. My adolescence had
seemed at the time merely a corner of the battlefield on which
my parents were engaged, but, now that the engagement was
over, I blanked out the combat and remembered only the
things that contrasted with my present state: the freedom to
wander over the countryside, walking or cycling, time to play
the piano not very well but with enjoyment, the liberty of the
world of books, where no one questioned what I read. My
University entrance work had given me a range of reading that
at college was narrowed down to a course as dry as a winter-borne
in summer. Despondency turned to utter misery and I
decided that there was only one way out of a state that seemed
to have no bearable present and no viable future. I made an attempt
in my college room to hang myself. I failed. I did not
even hurt myself. But I did give myself a severe shock which
released both my sense of humour and my will to live. To kill
myself seemed a capitulation to the despicable establishment
which was, after all, only going to last for a limited term.
My life was limitless, I realised. I laughed off my attempt as
the equivalent of a childish tantrum, and planned my second
year like a military campaign. I would indulge my taste for
music and I would get to know some of my fellow students.
I was not successful in the first, but in the second I was
rewarded.


When I left college, I knew that the only valuable thing I
had gained from my University years, apart, of course, from a
degree, which I am glad to have, however dismal most of the
work connected with it was at the time, was friendship. I had
fortunately acquired a love of poetry before I went to college.
Academic drouth could not succeed in drying up those springs.

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I lived with Diana for many years, and the friendship
remains though our lives are now separate. When she married,
I began to share a house with someone else, to whom I am
also deeply attached. Though I have not married or succeeded
in forming a permanent relationship with anyone I loved
sexually, I am quite likeable. I am not a monster with whom
no one can endure to live. Indeed, the two women who have
at different times made a home with me would say, I think,
that on balance they have gained from living with me, despite
my difficult temperament, the restless energy I possess, which
crackles through the house like electricity; the black moods
of despair; the constant need to withdraw for long periods by
myself.


And there is Rosemary, whom I have known all my life but
whom I see only intermittently. She erupts from time to time
into what I believe to be my inviolable privacy, with her excess
of energy, her heterogeneous interests and enthusiasms, her
passion for instruction. She tears me away from my writing,
even, to compel me to accompany her on some expedition from
which we bring back some utterly useless but fascinating object
-- a brass rubbing, a drawing of a church tower (for Rosemary
has a facility with a pencil which I envy), a photograph of a
misericord or bench-end which has taken an hour to obtain
because of the accompanying lecture on the meaning of its
symbolism. Or there have been those exhausting walks, when I
have found myself following some obscure hill path, and
denied the shorter route back because the longer route passed
by some iron-age encampment which must be inspected. To
me, these hill forts look much alike except for the views one

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although these three women have such a brief mention in
this book, I cannot minimise how much I owe to them, and
thinking about them prompts me to make a short digression on
the subject of friendship. The theme is love, and friendship
should properly form one of its variations.


It is extraordinary to me that so many people are willing to
inhibit their instinctive feelings, and reduce the bold demands
of their natures to relationships which consist of little more
than an exchange of dinner parties, Christmas cards, and telephone
conversations. A man who, today, wrote to a friend as
Donne did:
<blockquote>
<p>
Sir,
</p>
<p>
It should be no interruption to your pleasures, to hear
me often say that I love you ...
</p>
</blockquote>
would risk being stigmatised and laughed at for a ‘queer’. But
though overt expressions of sexual love may be absent, I believe
that the warmth of close friendship is pervasive through
the whole personality and may often touch, even if lightly, the
sexual field. In one of my workbooks, I found a quotation from
an American writer which put the matter admirably:
<blockquote>
<p>
Friendliness in general is subject to the anaemia which is
likely to blight all sublimations as they become more and
more widely dissociated from direct instinct gratifications.
Much that passes for friendship, for example, is motivated
entirely by opportunism and the wish to be amused ...
The capacity for friendship depends upon a kind of inner
vitality which permits a strong erotic component to be

injected into all human relationships ... Most people are
unable to support many friendships upon these terms.
The erotic component may be too weak, their fears
too great, or opportunity lacking for cultivating human
relationships.

<i>Man Against Himself</i>, Karl Menninger


I know of nothing in literature that so well supports Menninger&apos;s
psychological speculations as the following passage from
Louis Marlow&apos;s book, <i>Welsh Ambassadors</i>, a personal account
of the Powys family:
<blockquote>
<p>
At Cambridge Llewelyn [Powys] and I were friends at
once; and very soon we were very great friends. It was
the kind of friendship often enjoyed by men, and women
too, who are not homosexual, but who, possessing something
of the awareness of the artist and the ardour of the
poet, are drawn lovingly by the physical idiosyncrasies of
those of whom they are fond. The physical expressions of
a friend&apos;s nature, the physical conveyance of a friend&apos;s
charm, mean more to them than they do to others; they
are more deeply and movingly interfused with the friend&apos;s
self. It is possible for one man to be preoccupied with
another in loverlike fashion, as Llewelyn and I were, in
that special loverlike absorption, without the completeness
of being ‘in love’ as with a woman: though of course in
the two kinds of love many of the same elements exist.

I have felt the truth of these unfashionable words myself.
If I have omitted from this account any attempt to portray
those whom I have loved in much that way and upon those
terms, it is because I have chosen to be severely selective and do
not feel that every relationship I have made necessarily comes
within this book&apos;s compass. I realise that another omission,
some account of my profession, has been made, but for a
different reason. I dislike it, and feel under no obligation to

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Yet the very fact that I keep it dark has a significance for
me, for I have to confess that I am very successful at it, and
that this is a kind of offence to me, so deeply do I dislike it.
Were I to confront the girl of twenty with the woman I am
now, few things would surprise her more disagreeably than my
worldly success. This was something she never sought, that
indeed she actively proclaimed against and angrily foreswore.
Fame as a writer, yes. That was ardently desired and has been
increasingly desired with the years. I am as cruelly ambitious
as April to reach summer&apos;s zenith. But the rewards of a well-performed
career, no. There was no career that I wanted to
follow except that of a writer, but I lacked any confidence in
my ability to earn my living in this way, and pure chance put
me into a sphere where I have little more than the mild
satisfaction of doing a job properly that has to be done to earn
a living. I am a perfectionist and I would rather be competent
than incompetent. I regard myself as someone who has quite
fortuitously been given a kind of sleight of hand, like an ability
to do card tricks or skim stones across the surface of water.
It has required a certain skill and practice to perfect it, but it
touches only the edge of my mind.


I think that the twenty-year-old would despise the woman
of today, yet she too had her limitations, The girl who
had with unexpected perspicacity foreseen while still at school
that she could never accept domesticity, child-bearing and the
ties of social convention; who had determined, by the age of
fifteen, to devote her life to writing, and sworn that she would
be famous before she was thirty, entered a dead-end job at the
age of twenty-two, and wrote less in five years than she had
written in one at the age of seventeen. Far from devoting
herself single-mindedly to the business of becoming a writer,
she fell in love with a conventional young man and would
willingly have accepted marriage if it had been offered her,
though she pretended to herself, as far as I remember, that all

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I found myself tramping over derelict, unploughed fields,
helping Andrew to measure up half-ruined outbuildings, and
to wrestle with a perpetually recalcitrant electric generator
which stood in the yard and seemed petrified by the bleak east
winds and the inertia of years. In the late afternoon we would
come in exhausted to a large meal of solid, dull food, prepared
by a village woman. Suet pudding was an invariable accompaniment
to whatever meat we had. Andrew would kick off his
muddy boots and spend the evening in his working clothes,
walking over the flagged floors in his stockinged feet. He would
build the huge logs into a close-locked pile, his face ruddy with
heat, stand back admiring his handiwork, and pour me out
glasses of whisky without really looking at me.


All through the evening, the blaze was never allowed to die
down. He pulled the fire about and poked authoritatively,
and the talk would be all of barns and roofing materials and
fencing. If I had been more detached, I might have laughed to
see the way Andrew had shed his man-about-town veneer and
was acting himself into the farmer&apos;s role; I might, if I had
been more subtle, shared the tenderness with which he considered
every detail of his farm&apos;s well-being. At that time, I was
only too painfully aware that he was not considering mine, that

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Andrew suggested neither sleeping with me nor
marrying me, but made it clear that he regarded me simply as
a useful companion for his depressing rural occupations, I
skidded to an abrupt halt. I found myself very uncertain on
my feet when I picked myself up. I went into what the
Victorians termed a ‘decline’ and what the psalmist describes
more poetically--and accurately--in the phrase: My treadings
had well-nigh slipped.


It was not only this abortive affair with Andrew that was
responsible for my state. He was no more than the catalyst that
released inward pressures which had been building up for
years, now to rush upon me and throw my inner self into dusty
confusion as though a roof had collapsed. I had forced
beneath the surface the stresses created by my parents&apos; separation,
the wasted university years, my attempted suicide. Now
the total failure of my first attempt at a love affair broke into
these stern suppressions and I was very ill for about a year.


And yet, if I were to plot my life on a graph in terms
of happiness, the twenties would be a period when the line
showed a strong upward curve, when I began to understand
the nature of friendship and the value it was to have for me,
the period when I first tasted the incomparable pleasures of
sharing one&apos;s tastes and enthusiasms with a congenial companion.
That I was able to enjoy life, and that I emerged from
a serious breakdown relatively stable on my feet was certainly
due more to the devotion of my friends than my own strength
of will or understanding of myself.


I loved the life of London, the theatres, the concerts, the
evenings in the company of friends. I found it pleasant to share
a flat in south London, a flat of character and charm, that
provided a splendid view over Dulwich Vale to the Crystal
Palace. Diana and I had graduated to these enjoyable

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My office was in Westminster, which was also a pleasant
place to work in, with the riverside and the abbey precincts,
and St. James&apos;s Park. I used to buy a remarkably good packed
lunch for a shilling in a shop in Tufton Street. As far as I can
remember it consisted of several meat sandwiches, a piece of
cake, and an apple or an orange. I ate it in the abbey cloisters
or beside the lake in the park. Two million unemployed were
really paying for it, but I did not quite understand this, despite
my socialist principles. In the evening, there would be the
rollicking tramride home, past the Elephant and Castle, down
the Walworth Road with its herbalists&apos; emporiums and tattooing
experts, and the fried-fish shop on the right-hand side,
which sometimes delighted me with the chalked-up legend:
‘EYEBALLS TONIGHT’. Through Camberwell Green and
past the Tiger on the corner; up the shabby-genteel slopes of
Ruskin Park and Dogkennel Hill, with big houses set back amid
lawns and laurels in an air of decayed Victorian comfort
hedged in privacy.


I was young enough to enjoy this life enormously, despite
the two flaws which broke across those years like brown cracks
in a plate: the ignominious outcome of my love for Andrew,
and the breakdown in my health. I had hope enough not to
feel too seriously the inner discontents that were later to make
themselves far more imperious: a growing distrust in myself
and in my ability to become the writer I intended to be.
I suppose that, on balance, I had more belief in myself than
disbelief, and I had the resilience of youth. I had also certain

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Rather belatedly, I remembered that I was to be a writer,
and hastily put pen to paper, in what time I could spare
from the delights of music, the theatre and getting into the
country. Much of what I wrote consisted of fiery articles on
political and social subjects, a few of which were published
(without payment) in short-lived, red-covered magazines. But I
did not see myself as a journalist. Meetings were held at my
flat and I was urged to write for the cause, but I did not
respond with much enthusiasm. There was so much else to
occupy me. I discovered to my lasting joy the pleasure of
places. I explored the country round London, finding in Kent
and Sussex a countryside sufficiently akin to that I remembered
from my childhood for me to root myself at least
temporarily in it. I came to know well the Weald of Kent,
Ashdown Forest, and the downs that stretch from Cocking to
Petersfield.


I remember a night--we had acquired a ten-pound car by
now--when we found ourselves up on the hills near Hastings.
It was a warm, starry night, and we were reluctant to go home.
We pulled some dry bracken into a heap, covered ourselves
with a car rug, and slept out under the sky. I have never
forgotten the early morning on the downs, the silence, the
wheeling birds against an enormous colourless sky, the brown
trees below the hill, their long colonnades disappearing into a
white mist that filled the valley.


I experienced then one of the deepest joys I had yet known.
I recognised, however vaguely, something that was going to
become much clearer to me as time went on, that places
were to give me enduring happiness and peace, and that I
should come to know and love them intimately, perhaps more
intimately, than it is possible to know and love people.


Back in London, I withdrew myself behind a barricade of
books and began to study local history. I borrowed volume

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I began to write an absurd travel book, a kind of ‘Rural
Rides’. Without even visiting again the places that I had
known as a child, I conjured them up vividly before my eyes,
and wrote of them in loving and minute detail, adding for the
delectation of my reader, as I thought, a mass of information
about their past history. This monumentally boring book was
entitled <i>The Discursive Traveller</i>. Its one interesting and intriguing
feature was an ambiguous person who apparently
accompanied me upon my journey, with whom I discussed
life in philosophical and rather foolish terms, who slept in the
same room as myself, and was the subject of delicate hints at
eroticism which were not clear enough to titillate even the most
curious reader. It was never made plain whether this person
was male or female. I was obviously carrying on an internal
debate as to my sexual proclivities. I was also indulging in a
dream of irresponsibility, a life conducted exactly as I liked,
wandering round familiar places, never lonely when I needed
company, and with sensual love at hand for the asking. These
are the dreams which do no one any harm, but which it is
unwise to try and put into action, since they are doomed to
disappointment from the outset.


Fatuous though this book was, I loved it and kept it for years.
It was the first piece of my own writing with which I fell in
love--writing is very much like conducting a love affair.
I never showed <i>The Discursive Traveller</i> to a publisher. I was
content merely to write and perfect this derivative book (I had
become much addicted to Laurence Sterne at the time, and
imagined that I was writing a twentieth-century <i>Sentimental</i>

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had played this game before, as a child, practising this trick
against the forces of darkness. I am in the lane that led from
our Surrey home down to the village. How often was I sent to
the post along this lane on dark winter evenings. My father
was a countryman and had no idea that trees were a terror to
a child brought up in a town. Along one side of the road,
behind a bank, ran a deep and ancient drove way, slippery
with the leaves of a dozen seasons, and fraught with lurking
horrors. The trees met overhead and the lane was full of unidentifiable
sounds. Panic-stricken, I would force myself to
walk down it and home again by measuring it out in small
landmarks: the Congregational church, black but at least solid
and reassuring, the disused well, the huge Lombardy poplar at
the end of the garden which ‘ceaselessly gave a soft answer to
the wind’. At least in childhood the posts along the way are
familiar objects. As adults, we have to live more empirically,
more daringly, on hopes and suppositions and ideals, but I
have always retained this comforting habit of setting myself
limits and landmarks. When I arrived at the summer after I
was fifty, and was recovering from my overdose of Luminal,
I gave myself three targets, like the child in the Surrey lane:
twelve months; another twelve months; and then six months.
‘A time and a time and half a time’: the curious words that
Jobber Skald so often quotes to himself in John Cowper
Powys&apos;s novel, <i>Weymouth Sands</i>.


This is how I seem to have spent much of my life, edging
forward step by step, always forcing myself to look down at
the abyss under my feet, indeed at times preoccupied with it
to the point of falling; at other times foolhardy and willing to
take risks which surprise my cautious self; capable of enjoying

Throughout this precarious crawl through life, I have not
entirely lost the belief that it could be conducted more profitably
with another. But for too long I saw it in terms of a
pleasant walk, hand in hand, rather than in its true aspect: the
stern climb of two independent spirits, linked for safety by a
rope, responsible for each other only to the extent that they
are responsible for themselves.


Certain words and phrases have had an indescribably
strong influence upon me. One of these occurs in Verlaine&apos;s
lyric, <i>N&apos;est-ce-pas</i>? I have it still in a dog-eared little paper
edition, entitled <i>Quelques Poèmes</i>, and published for the
Fauré, Debussy and Verlaine commemorative concerts in
1943. I went to those concerts alone. I was at the time unhappy
in my work, my milieu, my loneliness and my total
absence of productivity, as unhappy as I was ever to be again
until after my suicide.


Sometimes I helped with outdoor labour as many of us did
during the war. I remember propping up the Verlaine on the
bough of an apple tree in front of me, and reading and learning
poems as I dug the heavy marl a few paces away, constantly
going over to the book to correct my memory.


<i>Sans nous préoccuper de ce que nous destine<br />
Le Sort, nous marcherons pourtant du même pas,<br />
Et la main dans la main, avec l&apos;âme enfantine<br />
De ceux qui s&apos;aiment sans mélange, n&apos;est-ce-pas?</i>


With whom? With whom? I had just parted from the
woman who had given me great happiness in love. With her
my personality had flowered in ways quite unexpected to me.
I carried into the waste of my thirties the bitterest regret that
I had lost her, and I searched for fifteen years afterwards for
someone with whom I could step, <i>la main dans la main</i>, whom

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I met Evelyn when I was about twenty-nine, soon after I
had changed my job and left London to work in a country
town. Is it possible to convey even a trace--<i>veteris vestigia
flammae</i>--of my feelings for this lively, sensitive, gifted woman
who, in Blake&apos;s words, opened the doors of perception for me
as no one hitherto had done?


We came to know each other through mutual interests in
music and poetry. She wrote both. So did I at that time. My
early meetings with her took place on the dusty stage of a
provincial theatre, where we rehearsed in the local choral
society. We sat on the back bench and left the front to the
elderly ladies, jostling for the conductor&apos;s attention, and vying
with one another so heartily that it sent their voices a trifle
sharp. The society was a well-known one and the conductor,
as well as being most attractive, was a first-rate musician. I was
fortunate that I learned much of what I know of choral music
from him. What glorious works we sang: Bach&apos;s Christmas
Oratorio, Mozart&apos;s Requiem, Haydn&apos;s Maria-Theresa Mass.
Sometimes Evelyn and I used to meet at the theatre when only
the orchestra was rehearsing. We sat at the back of the hall,
listening to works which are deeply imprinted on my memory,
partly for themselves and partly for their association with
Evelyn: Elgar&apos;s Introduction and Allegro for Strings, for instance.
Over and over again, the conductor rehearsed that
torrent of notes that echoed the mounting passion of our hearts.
After rehearsals, we used to have a meal, and then, one night,
I took Evelyn home. She lived several miles away in a house
buried deep in beech woods on a hillside.


We drew up at the gate and she got out and stood beside
the car. The moon was bright and the valley below us was a

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For eighteen months we saw each other constantly, but there
were many things that militated against our happiness. I was,
in truth, very green and most precariously balanced. I still
pined, or thought I did, for Andrew, though I never told
Evelyn of his existence. There were large areas of reticence between
us. I was unwilling to commit myself, and this was the
greatest stumbling-block to any enduring relationship. I refused
to throw up newly found work in order to set up a home
with her elsewhere, which is what she wanted. Another major
impediment to our happiness, though we hardly recognised it
at the time for we had so many other pleasures, was our inexperience
of sex. We were lamentably unenterprising. We lay
in bed, loving and content. We kissed and caressed but our
sensual pleasures were mild and inconclusive.


Evelyn, with her lively curiosity and her capacity for mental
and sensuous pleasure, gave me a view of life which I never
wholly abandoned even though I too often let it go underground.
I expressed it in one of the last poems I wrote before
my relationship with her broke up, and I did not experience
its truth again until I met Elizabeth. It was probably the best
poem I have ever written but not good enough to quote here.
The point it made was that love is not an ivory tower into
which you retreat, secure from experience without, from the
demands which other relationships or life in general may make
upon you. It is a fortress from which you plan, singly or together,
cunning and well-armed sorties against those elements

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Evelyn and I parted because I fell in love--or thought I had
-- with someone else. Deeply insecure and secretly disappointed
at the boring lack of conclusiveness in lesbian love as I then
knew it, I made a boast of inconstancy and openly proclaimed
my interest in Christopher, a young musician I had met and
with whom I spent an increasing amount of my time. My behaviour
was the culmination and expression of deeper and unrecognised
differences between us, but I knew Evelyn&apos;s character
so little that I was quite unprepared for the consequence.
She refused to see me again, and, to ensure that she did not, she
changed her job and left the district altogether. My letters she
did not answer. I was abruptly severed from the first person
with whom I had experienced anything approaching the true
state of being ‘in love’.


Ironically enough, she subsequently became engaged to a
man to whom I had introduced her. I met her again. I cannot
think what we imagined was to be gained from it, but we went
away for a short holiday together to the Hampshire downs
which we had explored so often. It was a miserable experience.
Evelyn discussed her future husband, Arnold, in fond and
intimate terms. ‘When we&apos;ve made love,’ she said with unction,
over a glass of beer, ‘he always turns over with his back towards
me and snores. I suppose I shall get used to it.’ I suppose she
did.


She dragged me to country sales to choose furniture for their
home. I was thankful to say goodbye to her, to the person she
had become. Yet though I remember and record these painful
things, these affronts to my romantic conception of love, they
do not impair the image I retain of her, which stays in my
mind as something brightly coloured, radiant. Gifted in many
directions, she was entirely unpretentious and modest. Evelyn
was well versed in the names of plants and trees and birds, so

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Years after I had parted from her, I saw her fiery hair
burning like a torch among the audience at a London concert.
She was alone and so was I. I waited at the door for her afterwards,
but she came out, her eyes full of remembered music,
and did not glance at me.


I now entered upon a new phase of my life and one which
was to last a long time. I staggered on in self-willed disintegration,
nourishing my isolated intellect on an enormous quantity
of reading, and searching with growing despair for my <i>métier</i>
as an artist, while my thirtieth birthday dropped further and
further behind me. The sexual side of myself I assuaged by
liaisons of such an exclusively sexual nature that any value
they may have had was more than outweighed by their contribution
to the imbalance and chaos of my disordered life.


The affair with Christopher was, I must admit here, a total
failure, despite the boastful and callous way in which I had
used it as a weapon to fight with Evelyn. Had she been more
experienced, she might have found ways to disarm me. Indeed,
I think now that I probably wanted to be disarmed, but she
was as ignorant of the warfare of love as I was. Her only
answer was total retreat, which left me nothing to triumph
over.


Christopher himself was a dead loss. A brilliant pianist, and
something of a composer, he was a hopeless neurotic, dominated
by his mother. We were, in our different ways, fascinated
by each other: I by his remarkable musicianship, and by his
fauve, shambling appearance, his dark eyes, and thick, curling
hair of Byronic length; he, I suppose, by my assumed air of
worldliness, and paper-thin assurance, and by my dedication
to the art of poetry, to which I had returned after a two-year

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Christopher and I thought it our Bohemian duty to sleep
with each other, but it was not very enjoyable for either of us.
To this musician, passionate enough at the keyboard, belongs
the dubious credit of taking my maidenhead, but he clearly
wished that he had not. Looking back on our inexpert lovemaking,
I am only surprised that he achieved anything so decisive
and irrevocable. He never reached anything so positive
in his compositions.


The failure of our affair did not prevent our remaining
friends for the few months left before war broke out. Then he
departed, I don&apos;t know where, and I did not see him again for
nearly twenty years. The meeting was a fiasco. I had, at least
in some respects, matured. I was well embarked upon my
writing career, and in my profession I was an acknowledged
success even if it meant little to me. Christopher had done
nothing. He played the piano still, but too unreliably to get
much professional employment. His creative vein had petered
out. He existed on a small allowance from his now aged
mother, though he no longer lived with her. His appearance
was exactly the same. His eyes were as dark and brilliant as
ever, but they no longer attracted me. We parted without
arranging a second meeting.


Long before this, when I was about thirty-five, I met
Maurice, a man of about my own age, with whom I fell in love
with sudden and painful completeness. I came to know him
through musical friends who held from time to time exhilarating
though exhausting parties in a shabby old Edwardian
mansion on the upper Thames. The whole place, house and
garden, was falling almost into ruin, inadequately heated and
totally lacking in hot water. Baths were a nightmare for the

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The house had a vast music studio containing a very beautiful
chamber organ. More money was spent on keeping this
room warm than on the whole of the rest of the building, for it
was here that most of the music was made, and the instruments
kept. But there were innumerable other rooms where one could
always find a few music stands, if not a piano. Maurice was
an excellent viola player, despite a severe physical handicap
that would have daunted a less determined man. He had lost
the fingers of his left hand, except for the thumb and fore-finger.
His instrument was therefore strung for him to finger
with his right hand, and his bow had a special fitment which
enabled him to control it with his mutilated left hand.


He minimised this handicap, as most disabled persons do, and
never referred or drew attention to it, usually wearing a glove
when he was not playing, or keeping his left hand in his pocket.
He compensated for the humiliation he secretly felt by being
almost as passionately athletic as he was music-loving. In particular
he was a superlatively good swimmer and tennis-player.
But under the apparently pleasure-loving and happy exterior
life he led, was an obsessional hatred for his father whose carelessness
with a woodsaw had caused the accident when
Maurice was sixteen. When I eventually heard the story I began
to understand why it was that Maurice was incapable of
suppressing a desire to wound anyone who offered him love.
People found him attractive, men enjoyed his wit, and
women succumbed quickly to his charm, and were carefully
steered away by his defensive armour from trying to mother
him. Yet as they talked about Maurice, it was apparent that
most were a little afraid of him, and when one heard the sorry
tale of his deliberate cruelties, which unguarded moments revealed

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Maurice was handsome, bearded like an Elizabethan at a
time when beards were uncommon. He was immensely proud
of his small, compact, muscular body and tanned skin. He
never allowed the parties to devote themselves for too long to
music-making. The intensity with which he himself played exhausted
him, and he would want to refresh himself by the
purely physical pleasure of walking or swimming, and if he
did not wish to be by himself would drag some of us off to
accompany him on, perhaps, a bathing expedition in the nearby
Thames. As he was himself in constant demand as a viola
player, his defection to the river was almost certain to break up
an ensemble, and we would come stumbling out into the sunshine
with our towels and swimsuits, to find Maurice standing
impatiently beside his ancient Bentley, clad only in bathing
shorts and plimsols, looking every inch an athlete.


I understood him very little. I knew that he slept around
with any girl who was willing, yet the fact that he continued to
demand my company gave me the illusion that it was myself
with whom his deeper feelings were involved. Although I
longed to sleep with him, I almost prided myself on the fact
that he never invited me to. I dreamed incessantly about him,
fervidly sexual dreams, tender romantic dreams, all the dreams
I should have dreamt twenty years before, when I was seventeen.


When I met him after an absence, he would make straight
for me, and sweep me into his orbit, sit all the evening with me
when he was not playing his viola, kiss me, take me out for long
walks in the dark lanes full of river scents, and tell me about
his life abroad, where he worked for much of the year, and the
girls he had and how little they meant to him.

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘Just bedworthy’, he would say, dismissing them, and far
from feeling despised that he did not seem to think me so, I
was secretly encouraged and elated. My private conviction
that I had access to a deeper part of him than any of his sexual
partners mitigated for me the too frequent unhappiness he
caused me. Suddenly, in the middle of a conversation, he would
change abruptly, perhaps at some chance unwary remark of
mine. The gaiety of his speech would falter, a shutter come
down over his face. He would remove his arm from my
shoulder and withdraw into a cold, black mood; say some
cruelly cutting thing to me, drive me away with a curt dismissal,
or go off with some other member of the party, deliberately
breaking some date he had with me, and contriving
that this should bring upon me a devastating and often public
humiliation. Yet he would not cast me off finally. He sparred
with me. He tried to see how far he could go. I let him come
too close and was badly hurt over and over again. We jousted
across the barrier in a game of which I really did not understand
the rules. Maurice made me suffer and it was the first
time that anyone had done this in such depth and with such
malevolent skill. I had inflicted suffering enough upon others.
Now I knew what it was like to have said to my face, casually:
‘Faithfulness is not a word that I recognise in my vocabulary’.
I did not really expect him to be faithful but the use of the
word as an aggressive weapon hurt.


I turned to others, even while I was still in love with
Maurice. I could not endure immediately the idea of making
love with another man. I sought an outlet in another lesbian
experiment, the most indiscreet affair in which I have ever
taken part.


Very late at night. The meadow at the back of the house is
washed empty in the light of the moon, scoured like a shallow
bowl. I avoid the paths. Walking on the damp grass under the
silver quince trees, and then through the back gate into the
road. It&apos;s a small town. It takes me only twenty minutes to
cross it to the house where she lives, in a room in Mrs.

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Before I go in, I wait for a few minutes to subdue my heart.
I&apos;ve been walking rapidly. Also I am, for the first time in my
life, subject to a strong physical desire that makes my blood
throb like drumbeats. I wait, not at the door where someone
might see me, but behind the hedge at the side of the house.
The air comes cold into my lungs, cold and laden with a heady
tang of laurel.


The nights shortened into summer. She slept out in the
garden sometimes, and I would step softly in my bare feet
under the stars to find her. When they lost their brilliance, I
knew it was time to go. On my way home I walk slowly, in
step with the dawn, my hair wet with dew.


There&apos;s a workman on his bike, riding to some legitimate
task. A railwayman, perhaps, or a farm worker. Grey trousers
clamped into bicycle clips and a bag at his saddlebar with his
sandwiches and tea-flask. He grins in a friendly fashion. She&apos;s
a collaborator, he thinks, a fellow-traveller up before sunrise.


‘Lovely morning!’ he calls. ‘Lovely morning!’


I&apos;m educated, curse it, my head full of poetry. I pull out a
quotation, but for my private ear, not for him: ‘The air is all
in spice.’


But we do share something: the privileged excitement of
being abroad at half-past five on a summer morning, when
others are asleep. His cockcrow smile is as good as a line of
poetry, any day.


The affair ended disastrously. She left a batch of my letters
at her home, in a suitcase, where they were found and read by
her parents. Her father, a high official in the church, wrote me
a letter threatening me with exposure and legal proceedings.
However, he was ignorant of the fact that lesbians cannot be
prosecuted. He consulted a lawyer, found out his mistake, and
penned another long and blistering letter, admitting his

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Easter. I am walking along a beach in the early sunshine of
the Sunday morning. The sea is very calm, lying supine in the
moment of pause between tide and tide, resting thinly over the
sands like a wafer on the tongue. And every tamarisk and every
clump of sea holly sends a long shadow over the golden sand.
Suddenly all my unhappiness drops away from me. I feel
overwhelmingly conscious of another&apos;s hand clasping my own,
the hand of this girl from whom I have only a few days before
parted finally. And I am filled not merely with the illusion of
her presence beside me but with a benison that pervades my
whole being. Perhaps the hand that held mine in its phantasmal
grasp that Easter morning was the hand of the life
force, that same power that laid the early sun on my skin with
its faint but welcome warmth, and drew my eyes to the far out
tide that must turn, and the long shadows that must shorten to
noon. The power of rocks and stones and trees.


I only saw this woman once again, many years later when
she was married and a mother. In the brief moment we were
left alone, she suddenly put her arms round me and said: ‘I
shall never cease to be glad that I knew you and that we loved.’
The nightmare that had preceded our parting was washed
away finally by this single, touching statement. It was the most
graceful ending I have ever known to any affair, though the
affair itself was one of the least creditable in my life.

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Music again, and an encounter which was brutish and
short. He was one of those perennial bachelors whose personal
self-satisfaction and sexual talents are such that he contrived to
live a life entirely uncommitted to anyone. The requirements
of such men are contained, as it were, in clearly labelled jars
on a shelf. They can take down whichever one they want at a
given moment. I met Philip at a music summer school. We
spent most of the fortnight together but there was no suggestion
that we should continue the affair. If it had been geographically
easy, no doubt we might have met again, at least for a
time, but the essence of Philip&apos;s way of life was that the jars of
sex and other requisites should be within easy reach. We lived
a hundred and fifty miles apart. Too far for convenience.


I learned something, however, from this brief encounter. I
discovered a sexual enjoyment quite new to me, and very
illuminating. I was surprised that I found it with someone for
whom I cared nothing. In retrospect it became entirely boring
to me, but I was filled with longing to experience these pleasures
with someone I loved--and this was still Maurice. The
misery of knowing what I had missed with him was sharpened
by the knowledge that I could not even see Maurice, for he
was now abroad. It was fortunate that at this point in my life
I embarked upon a liaison which lasted for several years and
which helped me to rid myself of the incubus of my love for
Maurice, which was causing me such profitless pain.


Gerald was friendly, kind, amusing, and good in bed. During
the first couple of years I knew him, I greatly enjoyed the
times we spent together. These were not very frequent, for he
was a married man with a family, but they were frequent
enough to give me a sense of being his mistress, and I learned
how rewarding it can be to have a clearly limited relationship,
and one where the limits are equally recognised by both
parties. He was in business when I first met him, and it was on
his trips to London that we used to meet. However, there came
upon him a curious and most unwelcome change. He suddenly
decided that he had missed his vocation, that he ought to leave

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sexually, Gerald changed as well. He was just as amorous,
but he was no longer amusing, because he was no longer
amused. He wanted me, but I had become a vice. Like most
people with a vice rather than a pleasure, he was in deadly
earnest over every move. He employed, to the point of excess,
practices which are enjoyable if you are in love but boring if
not actually disagreeable when you are not. For me, nothing
is sexually stimulating and pleasurable when it goes on too
long. I begin to go to sleep. I am also very resistant to the
suggestion that all is being done for <i>my</i> benefit when it is perfectly
obvious that it is done for his. ‘You are happy, aren&apos;t
you, darling?’ ‘You <i>are</i> enjoying this, aren&apos;t you, darling?’
‘Take it in your mouth and <i>enjoy</i> it, sweetheart.’ My mind, if
awake at all at this point, will wander off to the graffiti I so
often see on lavatory walls (Amesbury, Wilts., has the most
varied collection): ‘Shirley likes putting Pete&apos;s cock in her
mouth’, and I speculate why Shirley hasn&apos;t something better to
do.


Finally I became more than bored. I began to dislike
Gerald. In the circumstances under which we met, it was
difficult to escape from him, so I put myself under the protection
of a married couple who liked me and understood the
situation. The husband took me under his wing so effectively
that Gerald was annoyed and transferred his attentions to
someone less well protected and, presumably, more co-operative
orally. When we meet now, we do not even speak to one
another, and I look at him in wonder, amazed to think that

[p. <i>77</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This was my outward life for many years. Within myself
the fires were banked down. This does not imply that I was
neglecting them. I have never read so widely as I did during
my thirties. I discovered authors whom, fortunately, I had
not read in my immature youth. Conrad was one of these and
George Eliot another. At that time I read with an avidity I
cannot now feel for the writers of the sixties, the new authors
who were my near contemporaries, writers like Orwell, Isher-wood,
the group of poets centred round W. H. Auden, and
the many minor authors who helped to create that curious
oasis known as ‘the Thirties’, a kind of mirage between the first
decades of the century and the brutal forties.


I now regret a little of some of the reading I spent my time
upon and wish I had given my time to writers whom I may
never have leisure to read, like Tolstoy and Goethe and Boswell.
But I have no regrets for the paintings I saw or the music,
new and old, that I listened to. Music especially gave me experiences
which enriched me far beyond the literary pastures
in which I strayed too often profitlessly, always hopeful that
the written word would be a revelation. It can rarely be so in
a century when it has been debased by its use as an instrument
of propaganda, deception, and hypocrisy, and as a stimulant or
a soporific or a distraction. The Word has become mere words.


Benjamin Britten, Michael Tippett, Samuel Barber, Stravinsky,
Hindemith--there is not one to whom I am not deeply
indebted for some contribution to my life, and I am thankful
that I have some musical ability, so that I can not only listen
to their works but take part in many of them. I can think of
very few modern works of literature that have made anything
like the same impact upon me as, say, Bartok&apos;s quartets, Britten&apos;s
<i>Les Illuminations</i>, or Shostakovich&apos;s Fifth Symphony.


I no longer believed that my musical talent was more than
moderate, and I had long given up any attempt to compose. I
knew, too, that the poetry I had written was no more than an

There was an ironic footnote to my first published story.
Maurice was abroad when it appeared. I sent him a copy, of
course. He had asked me to do so. In fact, he had encouraged,
almost bullied me over my writing. But he never acknowledged
the copy of the magazine. He never wrote to me and it marked
the end of the affair, at last.


When I consider my sexual life, I see how defective I am. I
lack the capacity to enjoy sex for itself, as I enjoy many other
sensual pleasures. I must be involved with my partner on <i>some</i>
extra-sexual plane, even if it is no more than laughter. When
Gerald&apos;s sense of humour apparently deserted him and we had
to devote the night to sex ungarnished, as it were, I found it as
boring as a train journey without a book.


Which reminds me that a man once offered me a bag of
shrimps in a railway carriage, and asked me to go to Brighton
with him for the weekend. I am glad that I resisted the temptation
to go, for the bag of shrimps remains clear in my memory,
whereas the man himself does not. The sexual act is of itself
so unremarkable, and so repetitive, remaining a verb in the
present tense, no matter how you try to conjugate it, but it is

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To those who are connoisseurs in sexual excitation; those to
whom orgasms are a matter of measurement in time and
quality; to whom penises are organs to revere for their length
and thickness; who bring to sex a formidable array of techniques
and think in terms of positions, prowess and performance,
I fear I shall be a tedious writer. I enjoy sexual
pleasure but I want to discover how I react to someone as a
person far more than how I react to the insertion of their penis.
I can pretty nearly always predict the latter. I can never predict
the former. I am not a happy hedonist, though I can be a
hedonist when I am already happy. I am not a carefree sensualist
but I can abandon myself wholly to sensual joys when I
am free of care. I would rather sit and stare out of a window
than to go to the trouble of going to bed with someone, if it
were to bring me no more reward than an orgasm. I could
contrive that for myself.


Within the self that longs for the abandon and release of
sensual love there stands a detached observer, a kind of <i>eidolon</i>,
as the Stoics called it, an essence of self-hood which will never
be involved with another. To the person I love it may well be a
stumbling-block, perhaps an offence, and to myself an interfering
spoilsport.


Sex induces a sense of physical well-being which for me at
once opens the gates to every demand that my <i>whole</i> nature
requires to make. Since these demands are seldom met, sex
loses what pleasure it had, as though falling ‘like a spent exhalation’
into darkness. The <i>accidie</i> that follows the sexual act,
that utter melancholy of which Petronius wrote: <i>post coitum
triste est</i>, is something I have experienced over and over
again. Orgasm gives me a sense of opening outwards towards
the sun--but to what end, when the person who brought about
this extraordinary physical delusion neither possesses one&apos;s
heart nor is possessed? Then I am only aware of the purely

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I cannot now think that they were wasted, these years in
the wilderness of unsatisfactory sexual encounters and entire
loneliness of spirit, and I begin in my fifties to accept them, to
acknowledge that waste was as much a necessity to me as positive
experience, and must be regarded in itself as a contribution
to my life. And I recognise also that it is the years in the
desert that often precede the revelation. It was just before my
fortieth birthday that the revelation manifested itself; that I
realised with almost mystical clarity that I required happiness,
and that it was my birthright, something which had to be
won and was the reward of rebelling against the forces that
militated against it. I realised with a physical stab of amazement
that I was full of potential love of life, that I had within
me enormous capacities and dammed-up reserves that were
beating fiercely at the walls of non-commitment and isolating
introspection which had grown up, or rather which I had myself
built, around me. It was then that I set out quite consciously
to find someone with whom I could share this discovery
and with whom I could integrate my disparate parts.


I considered myself in relation to others, and from the random
encounters I have described I slowly drew up a kind of
blue-print of what I desired. One learns much from what is
absent. From Christopher, from Maurice, Gerald, Philip and
even from Evelyn--from what was lacking, I gradually clarified
the design. It was not altogether a matter of searching for
an ideal person, but for certain essential qualities, for a woman
or man who would see beyond the barriers of assumed wellbeing
and confidence that I had erected, admit the predicament
in the human situation, and enter with me upon a
conspiracy to outwit and out-manoeuvre not only the visible
pressures and power-blocs which constitute society and its
values, but also the swarming monsters which inhabit our
Hieronymus Bosch worlds.

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Did I in fact search at all? Is it not rather that I had the
good fortune to find? Like unto treasure hid in a field: the
which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof
goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Forgetful
of those wise words, I did not sell all that I had, and
therein lay my deserved loss of Elizabeth. It is now time to give
some account of her and my love for her.


Those who attempt to describe their own happiness in love
often fall into sentimentality. This is not necessarily an indication
of shallowness of emotion. You fasten upon the trivia of
love because you cannot bring yourself to speak of things that
touch you too deeply. When I consider how I am to prove that
for five years I was supremely happy with Elizabeth, I do not
know how to do it.


It is easier to describe what damages a love affair or what
destroys it than the love itself, with its private joys and intimate
pleasures. It is, therefore, comparatively simple for me
to analyse the breakdown of my relationship with Elizabeth,
though I say this with humility, because I may be wrong and
she cannot speak for herself. What is not easy, and indeed may
prove impossible, is to describe the essence of the relationship.
If we could be articulate about this elusive compound, love,
we could explain adequately what puzzles everyone but ourselves
--namely, why we two particular people fell in love.
From this premise, if it were stateable at all, we could then go
on to define the quality that made our love unique. But this
is precisely what we cannot explain. It baffles not only our
speech, but even our rational processes. To frame the words
for such a revelation places too great a strain upon the already
limited means of verbal communication.


When I first met Elizabeth, I was just finishing a book rather
different from those I had written before. I was a little uncertain
as to whether I had pulled it off. Elizabeth was in the
publishing world. She asked me if she could read it, unofficially.
When she had finished it, she wrote me several pages of
criticism and notes about it. I can see the foolscap sheets now,

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What changes in the chemistry of our souls, what imperceptible
shiftings and redispositions of our inner cosmography take
place between the day when we first encounter the person we
shall love in the future, and the moment when love is fully
realised? ‘Whil&apos;st our soules negotiate there’, we continue to
meet, to exchange conversation, to live on the usual terms of
social intercourse--for how long unaware of the ‘new concoction’,
as Donne puts it, that is being brewed by love within
us? It may be, for a very long time.


I suppose that we could have taken this step towards each
other on some quite different pretext. The newly written book
was an opportune point of parley for our ‘two equall Armies’.
By this time, I no longer disliked her as I had when I first met
her. She was interested in me and my writing. Writers are too
much in need of this to refuse it lightly. A typed manuscript
brought us together as though we were two swimmers whose
hands met over the same spar. And this is a fair simile, for love
does spring from a desperate need and at first both lovers seize
upon it as if the value resided in something outside themselves.


That winter I read for the first time two scholarly books
about the Brontës&apos; childhoods. I had been wondering how I
could reward Elizabeth tactfully for the trouble she had taken
over the manuscript. I bought the books and gave them to her.
And it was then, in the act of giving, that I recognised with
involuntary wonder, the birth of feelings about her which at
the time I hoped that I could suppress. This did not prove
possible.


I find myself ill-equipped with words to convey the subtleties
of love. As I am writing this, there is on my desk something
which gives me a deep sensual pleasure, a dark red rose. The
petals have a pile like velvet; the scent is warm and heady;
the shape of the rose is one of the most perfect in nature. The
opulent rose, called Josephine Bruce, is standing in a vase of
very thin emerald green glass, which displays it beautifully

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>When love, with one another so<br />
Interinanimates two soules,<br />
That abler soule, which thence doth flow,<br />
Defects of loneliness controules</i>.


To read this poem, <i>The Exstasie</i>, again, as I have at this
moment, and read it for the first time for many years, is to
realise that nothing was ever said by any poet or philosopher
which analysed so powerfully and truthfully both the consummation
of love, and the strange moment of pause before it, a
moment which may last days or months. In Donne&apos;s poem, the
lovers are together for a few hours, ‘and we said nothing all the
day’. But time is an arbitrary division. For all lovers, Donne&apos;s
‘negotiation of soules’, takes what time it will.


The love that Elizabeth and I experienced was for me, and
for her too at the time, the most rewarding experience I have
known or dreamed of. I have something to compare it with, for
not only have I loved before but as a writer I have felt
those ecstasies of creation which have so much affinity with the
process of falling in love, and of consummating love, with its
subsequent sense of utter well-being.


Sexually, I found with Elizabeth what I had not found with
Evelyn and only experienced in other affairs on a purely

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The last thing I wish to do in this book is to make any
special pleading for the pleasures of homosexuality or any
attempt to explain why I should be a lesbian. The analyses I
read usually seem to me quite wide of the mark and I warn
readers to beware of them. However, I will make some sort of
statement arising from my own experience which may help to
correct both the misunderstanding on the part of the public
and the knowing statistics of the pundits.


I detect a distasteful ‘holier than thou’ attitude in the
assumption made by some writers in the psychological field
that deviants cannot know the full joys of love. Who is to
measure one joy against another? The statement seems to me
incapable of proof and therefore better left unsaid. It is mere
opinion. It is stupid and ignorant to regard homosexual passion
as something sub-standard or second-rate, as though love
were a material object which could be given a Good Housekeeping
seal or a Design Centre award.


As for the disgust with which so many people view the
notion of two men or two women sleeping together, this is a
prejudice whose roots are too deep-seated and complex in
origin to be discussed or dismissed lightly. It exists, whatever
the reasons, and colours much of the obloquy hurled at homosexuals
and much of the ridicule that raises guffaws at the
spectacle of a homosexual in a film or a play. No one, however,
should leave his conscience unexamined in this matter. To
approve one form of love and condemn the other on the score
that one is natural and moral and the other is not, is to refuse
to face the truth that any sexual act remains, without love and
tenderness, as gross and brief as a farmyard encounter, comic,
ludicrous, nauseating, the beast with two backs.


Love dignifies the absurd, and if it dignifies it in heterosexual

One Saturday early in March 1956, I took Elizabeth out for
the day in the car. No one knew I was meeting her. It was very
warm and sunny. We sat on a hillside in Kent and ate cold
chicken and drank half a bottle of wine. I did not record it in
my diary, perhaps because it meant too much to me, but a
few days later, among some very mundane entries, I find the
following:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>March 14th</i>
</p>
<p>
The happiness that contains me is like a crystal globe
through which I look into an enchanted and delightful
garden.
</p>
</blockquote>


<i>March 14th</i>


The happiness that contains me is like a crystal globe
through which I look into an enchanted and delightful
garden.


Like a sundial, memory shows only the sunny hours. Of my
childhood, I remember the richly scented downs, with the
gorse burning in the sunshine; the smell of the sea and the
breweries, and the backwater; the feel of hot sand running
through my fingers, of cold, wet pebbles at the edge of the
waves; the wind cutting my bare legs as I walked along the top
of the stone sea wall. Of my school days, I remember the place
which became my secret refuge and so grew into my heart that
I was able to write of it thirty years later, as though I had only
recently discovered it. Of my twenties, it is London that I recall,
and the friendships that made up the web of my life in a city.

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For my loves, I still have a tenderness for those who really
engaged my heart, even if only briefly, and those who did not
have left me a legacy of laughter at myself, even when they
have not left me their names.


Of my love for Elizabeth, I remember nothing but happiness.
When I first started to re-read my diaries, and reached
the year 1956, the year when we fell in love, it was the record
of happiness that I dreaded. I had been through all the pain of
losing it and I wanted to forget. At last I steeled myself to read
them. What I found in them is not truer than my memory, but
it was true at the time and ‘plainer than the infancy of truth’.
Troilus must stand as the prototype of all lovers for whom
reality is too painful to bear. ‘This is and is not Cressid,’ he
cries bitterly. Ah, but it is. It must be. <i>All</i> the truths must be
present. The history of scientific discovery should have taught
us that truth&apos;s landscape holds some startling contrasts and
glaring antinomies. What the diaries reveal is not the defect in
the relationship itself, but an inner core of unhappiness in me--
I did not know then that Elizabeth had her own sorrow--and a
central inner refusal on my part to commit myself even then to
this love that I had searched for and found.


The essence of my relationship with Elizabeth was the harmony
that existed between us and embraced all facets of love:
sex, companionship, silence. One of the strongest bonds was
our sense of humour. We were so well attuned that we were
always at ease in each other&apos;s company. Without it, I doubt if
we should have survived our first night together. After the
stolen hours when we made love in London, in circumstances
that prevented us from enjoying the experience of falling
asleep together, we were at last able to go away together, and I
selected, as I thought, a peaceful country hotel in East Anglia.


We arrived there late in the evening to find that it was
situated immediately beside a railway junction. We spent a
sleepless night, the trains shunting to and fro, a relentless background
of puffing and snorting and metallic collision which
accompanied the laughter and love-making going on within

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Not long after this, I was away for a brief holiday, while
Elizabeth was abroad. I wrote in my diary:
<blockquote>
<p>
I have come to a firm decision that I must find some place
where I can work undisturbed and live alone as I like and
wear my old clothes and live off cheese and dates and
eggs and drink whisky galore and be a mild and cultured
savage.
</p>
</blockquote>


I have come to a firm decision that I must find some place
where I can work undisturbed and live alone as I like and
wear my old clothes and live off cheese and dates and
eggs and drink whisky galore and be a mild and cultured
savage.


No mention of Elizabeth or our love, or the future we
planned together.


How significant that I should have written that and never
noticed that it contained the evidence that there exists in me a
person who cannot share a life with anyone. How extraordinary
that at the height of my extreme happiness, believing
myself to have found in Elizabeth the love I had been seeking
for years, I could determine that I would one day ‘live alone’.


A little later I went on:
<blockquote>
<p>
I am frightened at my detachment. The detachment of
my thoughts; at the sudden fears that attacked me last
night in full force, though I have felt warnings of them
before. I wonder if I shall be able to stand living at close
quarters with someone ...
</p>
<p>
The image of isolation in the novel needs to be thought
out deeply. I can only do it if I withdraw into myself
more.
</p>
</blockquote>


I am frightened at my detachment. The detachment of
my thoughts; at the sudden fears that attacked me last
night in full force, though I have felt warnings of them
before. I wonder if I shall be able to stand living at close
quarters with someone ...


The image of isolation in the novel needs to be thought
out deeply. I can only do it if I withdraw into myself
more.


Now I am really confronted with myself. There is no
evasion possible. Knowing how deeply I loved Elizabeth, and
how prolonged the sense of loss, it takes a violent inquisitorial
wrench of the screw to make myself answer now this question:
Did I ever intend this love to be more than an affair?

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

How I hate these diaries now. They reveal too much to me.
How gratifying the picture you build up of yourself until you
suddenly see the self-portrait of years before, and have no
longer the excuse that the likeness is falsely drawn by another.


I see my present life breaking in pieces and I do not want
to lose it. There is a limit to what I will pay, I suppose.
Elizabeth has said, perspicaciously, that if I will not pay
it, I may find myself falling back on what is no longer
there ...


I recorded a weekend in the upper Thames valley, and I
quote it not for itself but because it is typical of many such
entries about our days and nights together during the five years
I knew her as a lover. To quote many such passages would say
no more. One must speak for them all.


It was very hot and thundery in the evening when we
arrived and found a camping site. The cornfields were lurid
under a brilliant hectic sky. We didn&apos;t sleep too well, but there
was the pleasure of waking continually to find her there beside
me, and during the night the storm cleared away and I woke
to a bright morning.


A green light suffused the tent. The day smelt new and
birds were singing with that kind of abandon they display
when there is no human to invade and alarm their world
of open field and hedgerow. I lay for a long time, wholly
given up to the all-pervading pleasure that soaked into me
like the sun&apos;s warmth, the conscious pleasure of having
beside me a warm, breathing, loving presence and around
me a natural world new-minted in the dawn.


Soon after this, Elizabeth came to stay with me for three
weeks in my London home. The morning she was to arrive, I
wrote:

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is seven and I must get up. But lying in my bed I cannot
but record -- how pleasant it is here. To be lying in
bed alone in the house. How pleasant it is. Oh, really,
what a ludicrous figure I am.


The three weeks were the first long uninterrupted spell that
we had had with each other and they established us in our
happiness, despite my meditation on the pleasures of being
alone. Elizabeth had some editing work to do which had to be
done away from her office, so we worked all the morning, she
for her publisher, and I at a novel which I was just finishing.
After eating cheese and fruit, we worked again, and then prepared
a large evening meal, and after eating it, we talked and
read and listened to music. I thought it a perfect life. Indeed,
it is, and I can think of no way of life that can compare with it,
for me.


Every love carries the seeds of its destruction within it, and
Elizabeth saw this far more clearly than I did. On a foggy
morning in the late autumn of 1960, we left her flat after a
night together and walked in a near-by park. Houses and trees
were vapourish and indistinct. There was that sweet autumnal
smell in the air which even city smoke cannot dispel. We loved
much of our city life, despite our passion for the country. The
river especially was a place we visited and revisited very early
or in the evening, to watch the water burst into warmth as the
setting sun flooded the whole sky with colour and blazed its
reflected light into every riverside window; the lanes and
alleys; the ruinous old squares. How often, when we enjoyed
such pleasures, had I attempted to persuade her that they
formed the basis of our happiness. Here we are, I cried, at the
centre of our universe, snatching at its pleasures like children
grasping at flowers and grasses in the summer fields. And she
agreed -- and doubted. I quoted Llewelyn Powys at her,
Epicurus, anyone who supported my hedonism. She listened
and said that she felt that, somewhere in all this, there was a
flaw.

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now, as we wandered with clasped hands through the foggy
park, with only a hint of sunshine behind the yellow stucco of
the houses on its fringe, Elizabeth fell silent and when we
parted, she went home and wrote me a letter saying that she
could not endure her loneliness much longer. I did not understand
what she meant.
