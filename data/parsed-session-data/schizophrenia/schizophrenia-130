<b>I</b>t was Halloween, and I was home.
Sort of.


I was back in New York around three on Sunday afternoon, but
instead of going to my apartment I was going directly to the police
station and my old buddies Sean and Dave, the police who'd last seen
me make a fool of myself as I hopped into a cab that would take me
to Texas, where I had just left a part of my heart, and some of my
blood.


"Guess what, guys? It didn't pan out. Except I cut my wrist a little
and almost drowned and had a nervous breakdown (another one)
and still didn't find my brother, so you think you guys could take
over from here? I'm kinda worn out."


I didn't know what else to do.

[p. <i>235</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00242&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

More than forty-eight hours had passed since I first got the call
that Tim was missing. I had no more money; I hadn't showered in
days—except for my dunk in the Guadalupe; I had abandoned my
boyfriend; I had been taught some life lessons by a complete stranger
and, I didn't know what else to do.


As I got out of the subway a few blocks from the police station, a
group of children in Halloween costumes came barreling down on
me, their voices so high and squealing, my hands flew to protect my
ears. I was swallowed up in that sea of costumes, mermaids and
pirates and witches and devils, going from store to store in the
neighborhood in their late Sunday afternoon hunt for candy.


A little boy in a devil's costume and pitchfork jabbed me, but I
didn't jump. I was too hypnotized seeing myself in him, from a time
long ago when I had been a little boy dressed up like a devil, trying
to scare away the bad things.


Devil costumes: the last Halloween costumes our mother would
ever see us wear, in the third grade, five months before her death.
For some reason that year, she had let us splurge on Halloween and
get real costumes, not those scratchy nylon things that were
squeezed into black-and-orange cardboard boxes with cellophane
windows. She had taken us to the nicest clothing store in town, to
pick out a pattern from the Butterick catalog for our neighborhood
babysitter/seamstress to make for us.


Standing on our tiptoes to page through that catalog, high up on
a counter, Tim and I settled on devil costumes because we loved
the appendages that stuck out of them: cotton-stuffed horns atop a
little skullcap, a forked tail, and the best feature of all, a large fluffy

[p. <i>236</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00243&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That fated Halloween of our devil costumes, after we had gone
trick-or-treating, our father took us to his Lion's Club carnival, on
the parking lot of McKinney's first shopping mall. In the costume
contest, a "fashion lady," as we called her, flamboyant by McKinney's
standards, pulled us out of the line-up, fluffed out our capes for all
to see, to admire the handiwork herself. We were awarded third
place and given two separate but equal five dollar bills. Our father
drove us home after our big win, then went back to the carnival with
the excuse—half legitimate, half not—of helping to tear down the
rides when the carnival was over. He had started drinking earlier that
evening; I heard my mother tell him not to bother coming home
that night, and he didn't. I wore my devil costume to bed that
night—horns, tail, cap, and everything—to stretch out the excitement
of winning, to protect myself from any bad dreams that would
come during the night.


That was our mother's last Halloween.


I would wear that costume for the next several Halloweens, long
past the time I was too old to go trick or treating; I wore it to try
and bring my mother back from the dead. By my last Halloween, in
the sixth grade, the costume was sad and forlorn from my sleeping
in it; the red had faded to dingy pink, the horns sagged, the cape was
torn. But I wore it anyway, up and down the street by myself; it was
my armor, coated with special alloys to make me invulnerable to
pain. When one neighbor told me I was too old for candy, I finally
went home, to Tim's "I told you so."


After that, I combined Tim's devil cape with mine, put them

[p. <i>237</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00244&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That cape would literally save my mother, but not me.


But not yet, not yet. That story must wait.


I have to save Tim first.


I went back to the police station, even though I thought Tim was
dead. Friday, Saturday, Sunday afternoon; three days and nothing. He
had never disappeared for that long with no word.


The<i>word</i>was dead.


Sean and Dave were all I had, but I had the feeling they wouldn't
know what else to do either. They had already broken into his apartment.
I had done all the detective work they would normally do—
called Tim's friends, checked out the places he had last been seen or
heard from, flown to and from halfway across the country—but now
I just wanted to sit and do nothing. I could sit on one of those
wooden benches in the police station as easily as any other grieving
family member.


On my way to the station, I stopped at a pay phone and checked
back home for messages, but there were none. ("I don't suppose
there's anything in that bag of tricks for me," Dorothy Gale had
asked, after the Wizard had given out all he had to her fellow travelers.
"No," he answered sadly, knowing how much the answer
would upset her, knowing he wasn't a wizard, but just an old man
who had gotten as lost as she had.)


This time, there was a woman at the station's front desk, not
a male clerk; she told me to wait. This time, I didn't want to push
ahead, insist on my importance, as I had in the ER, but just stop and

[p. <i>238</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00245&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

An arm.


A leg.


Whatever.


A pay phone was across from the bench. Using it would just be
killing time, I knew; I had already called home and Tim's apartment
so much, nothing would have changed. But I decided to call
anyway, something to be active, so I wouldn't look like a victim or
a suspect, sitting on that bench.


I called Tim's apartment.


Nothing.


I called my apartment.


Something.


The staticky sound of the tape rewinding let me know that
someone had called. I pressed the buttons that would play back the
message and turn the static white noise into words.


They were words I hadn't ever expected to hear again, from the
voice I had been waiting for all weekend: Tim's. Tired, drugged,
telling me he was—what? I want to be exact here—not "okay," but
just...was.


Alive.


That's not the word he used, but it's the only one I can think of
right now.


Alive.

[p. <i>239</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00246&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Speaking into the phone.


Leaving wherever he was to go back to his apartment.


Tim.


It was Tim.


It was.


Tim.


I suddenly understood Gertrude Stein.


Yes and no, both at the same time. The word hasn't been invented
to describe what I felt; only gestures and angry scratches and blood
would do.


I understood Jackson Pollock now, too, a million colors splattered
on a canvas to turn it into one big angry blob.


My heart stopped.


It started again and ricocheted out of my body, banging against
walls, leaving blood and tissue everywhere.


My brother was back from the dead.


The relief lasted a millisecond; the fury was...


AAAHHHHHH...


I HATED HIM.


I slid down the wall and folded over into a fetal position, shaking,
epileptic, because of a phone call no one else had heard.


I wanted the police, the woman at the desk, Dave and Sean, the
junkies and whores, to see how mad I was, that this wasn't a joke.
I wanted them to see that I had just heard Lazarus had risen from
the dead, something that hadn't happened in over two thousand
years.


I had just heard a miracle.


The woman at the front desk came running to me; even one of
the whores sitting on the bench came to help, smelling of musk. The
one fragrance I had ever worn in my life, Jovan Musk, that I hadn't

[p. <i>240</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00247&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

NO.


The woman at the desk didn't come to me.


A whore sat on the bench, but she didn't come to me either.


I didn't slide down the wall, although I wanted to; I calmly put the
receiver back on the hook and betrayed nothing of what I had just heard.


Tim's drugged-out voice, after a disappearance of three days,
saying he was going home: that's the only thing that was true.


The whore did wear Jovan Musk, though; I smelled it. And I did
wear it in high school.


(I don't even know that she was a whore.)


That much is true.


I started walking toward the desk, wondering if I should just walk
on by, or tell them I was going. No one would miss me if I left;
clearly no one would miss me at all.Tim hadn't. But I didn't have to
decide. The desk woman said Sean and Dave were on their way back
to the station.


I said, "It's okay, I just got a message that my brother's okay."


I walked out as quickly as I could.


That's the truth.


I couldn't be alone.


That's the truth, too.


My brother was alive.


That's the truth.


After all my searching, he had been found, but I hadn't found him.


He had just found himself.


I could have been asleep all weekend, not going anywhere, not
breaking my heart, maybe breaking someone else's, and the outcome
would have been the same.

[p. <i>241</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00248&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He would have found himself.


I called my friend Brett, who had dutifully stood by me on so
many occasions, whom I had called on Friday to tell what had happened.
He would be waiting for me, at his apartment on the Upper
West Side, the wheelchair and ambulance ready as the plane pulled
onto the runway.


I stopped at a Korean vegetable market, with its fruit salads in
plastic containers and fresh flowers hidden by bamboo curtains, and
bought the cheapest pack of gum—Juicy Fruit, still just a quarter for
a foil-sealed pack—to get change for phone calls. I called Porky first,
and told him that at least Tim was alive; I didn't know anything else,
not yet. I wanted him to shout with me, to shout at Tim, to match
my anger, but he didn't. I called Frank, Tim's boss. He told me that
everything was going to be okay, that we'd get it all worked out.


No, we wouldn't.


<i>That</i> was the truth.


Porky, Frank...they didn't get it.


They hadn't buried Tim in their dreams.


They hadn't heard the music that would be played at his funeral—
"A Quiet Place," from the record album we had made in high
school, to finance our church choir trip to Puerto Rico. The song
that Tim had told me, way back then, he had wanted played at his
funeral.


They hadn't known that I had died, that I had lost myself and
wondered if I would ever be found, that I was Tim and Kim at the
same time, that I had seen and mourned my own death, because I
couldn't go on living if Tim wasn't here.


They hadn't seen that.


They hadn't seen me in my coffin.


They hadn't known.

[p. <i>242</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00249&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They couldn't.


Nobody could know but me.


If Tim was dead, then so was I; my reason for living would be
gone, and I would just fade away, whether I did it by my own hand
or not.


The sad truth.


I took a cab across town to Brett, flopped down on his trundle bed
that was already pulled out, as if waiting for my collapse.


I called Tim's apartment; he picked up the phone in the same
drugged, sad voice, telling me he had just set up an emergency session
with his shrink and couldn't see me yet. He was more worried about
what Frank had said, about losing his job, than seeing me. I was the
expendable one; I would survive. Well, fuck you, Gloria Gaynor, I
wouldn't. I screamed at him that I didn't know what Frank was going
to do; I wanted him to be afraid, to be in as much pain as I had been.


I wanted to kill him, now that he was found.


I screamed did he know what it was like to go through old pictures
for a missing person's poster.


I screamed at him did he know what it was like to hold your
breath as a policeman opened a bathroom door, because you're sure
a dead body's going to be on the other side.


I screamed at him: "Why'd you do that?! Why'd you DO that!
WHY'D YOU WANNA HURT ME!?? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO YOU. You could at least THANK me! I SAVED
YOUR FUCKING LIFE!!!"


I screamed at him what I had stolen from Stan, what he had
screamed at me, back on a bluff overlooking a river in Texas.


I screamed at him that the worst thing a person could ever do was
kill himself and make someone else witness it, and be left alone, as
he had left me.

[p. <i>243</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00250&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I screamed at him I hate you I hate you I hate you before I slammed
the phone down, and tears burned my face with heat and salt.


You may have seen broken men, but you have never seen a broken
man like me.


They were the words Tim had used to describe his nervous break-down,
but now they fit me, more than they ever fit him:


YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A BROKEN MAN LIKE ME.


I washed my face at Brett's house and went home.


Tim called near dusk that Sunday night, after a three-hour session
with his shrink. He didn't remember much of what had happened,
except that he had woken up on a bench in Central Park. He had
gotten drunk Thursday night, at Peter's apartment and afterward, at
Uncle Charlie's, knowing it was the anniversary of his breakdown,
knowing he was going to have to pack up and leave for yet another
new home the next day. He had planned to go to Texas, to escape,
but hadn't; he had called a car service that he never met. How he had
passed the days to Sunday he didn't know—and he would never
remember, or tell me, at least—except that he had gone from man
to man, stranger to stranger. He woke up shivering on a bench in the
park, covered by wet fall leaves.


Halloween had come; red and gold leaves had fallen and covered
him, maybe the one bit of protection he had, hiding him so no one
could kill him, except himself.


In my mind, I had seen him covered by leaves.


Somehow, I had known where he was.


On the phone, he told me his story, and I told him mine: I had
walked on eggshells around him, waiting for the bomb to go off, ever

[p. <i>244</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00251&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But there would be no more.


My skin couldn't take it.


I couldn't take it.


And yet, I would—after threatening that I wouldn't help him
move to New Jersey that evening, our last chance to use Jess's car
before he had to take it out of town the next day.


I threatened him but knew I would help. It went to the very core
of our twin DNA; no matter what I said, it was the one unchangeable
thread. I knew I couldn't keep my promise never to help again.
I made my first promise in the womb—to come out first—and I
knew I would continue making promises, and keeping them, until
I died.


I might hate him, but I would still help him.


I might hate <i>myself</i> for it, but I would do it, because it was easier
than the gnawing worry I would go through about what would
happen to him if I <i>didn't</i> help. The relief that he was okay, for now,
had completely disappeared, in the anger of riding to the rescue yet
again. We were back to our old pattern, however much I might have
told myself "just this one last time."


I told him I would be there to pick him up and he'd better be
ready.


Several hours later, around eight or nine that Sunday evening, I
drove Jess's car from Brooklyn to the Upper East Side, such a foreign
land until the past few days. I pretended the minor dips in the road
were the hills and valleys of San Francisco; I forced myself to think
about cable cars and Rice-a-Roni. As I gunned the car and bounced

[p. <i>245</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00252&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I parked in front of the apartment complex in exactly the same
spot the police had two days before, Friday afternoon, a million years
ago. The old car had sputtered on the way here; now I wondered if
I could get it to start again. We would have to hurry. Walking across
the courtyard, I looked around furtively for the super, wondering if
he had set up watch to capture the escaping twins, get them before
they could climb over the Alps, out of danger. (That's it, Kim, make
it all a game; use some metaphor, some movie reference, instead of
digging into your own heart to see how you really feel.)


What did I really feel?


Nothing.


But really, everything. So much going on it was like one of those
canvases that just looked black but was really the accumulation of
every color. The same thing I felt when Tim told me how our
mother died, and I writhed on the kitchen floor, the same way she
had. I could describe what I saw, but not how I felt.


And what I saw, as I opened the door on that fourth-floor landing
and saw my twin brother for the first time in days: a face as red and
puffy as mine from all the crying. We certainly looked enough alike
to be brothers, but at that moment, we looked identical: our faces
had the same redness and puffiness and tiny little blood vessels popping
out in our eyes. We looked like we had been on the same trip,
with the same deprivations: no shaving or face-washing, hair mussed
and greasy, clothes rumpled and smelly, unchanged for days. For two
boys who had always looked different enough to be thought of as
the little brother and the big brother, we finally looked like mirror
images, our faces young and old and weighted down by history, all
at once. And all the same. And even though one look said he'd gone

[p. <i>246</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00253&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Just myself.


As we silently glared at each other, daring the other to speak first,
this is what I saw, that wouldn't let it go: our patented stare, the stare
that had started as far back as the womb, saying, "You go first."


The stare from Tim's suicide attempt, saying, "I win."


The stare from his hospital room, saying "Do you forgive me?"


But I couldn't forgive him.


I couldn't even look at him.


If it was a big reunion scene I wanted, or expected, or even
needed, it wouldn't be happening; I could already tell. It wouldn't
happen, because I wouldn't let it.


I barged into the apartment, barely saying anything, just grabbing
stuff, the inevitable green trash bags that would stretch and go
translucent as I carried them down the stairs, bouncing out in front
of my knees. They were the perfect metaphor for his life: stretching
and ripping and tearing, but never quite spilling all the way open,
because of all he pushed inside, so malleable you could stuff them
anywhere.


He did try to break the silence: "Please don't be this way. Please
don't act this way." But the words didn't have any energy, or real
pleading, left in them; they were just exhausted, taking all the
breath, the little effort he had left, just to get out. His emergency
session with his shrink had used up all the words he had. And when
I didn't even acknowledge them, the few words that were left, but
just kept moving green trash bags, he gave up trying to say anything
more.


I didn't care.


All the desperation I had felt earlier to know where he'd been,

[p. <i>247</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00254&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He'd spent the time running away.


So had I.


We were the same, after all: I'd spent the time with a young boy I
barely knew.


I hadn't been drinking, we didn't have sex—although I probably
wanted to—but wasn't it the same?


Maybe that's why I was so angry, and silent, and ashamed.


We were the same, after all.


When I finally did speak, it was to ask Tim a question about his
mattress, the very last thing of his left in the room, and whether he
wanted to take it.


"Well, do you or don't you need it? What are you going to sleep
on tonight? Another park bench?"


(Only my nose and eyes were still above ground.—I was gasping
for air as the devil pulled me deeper into hell and poured more
venom into my mouth.)


Tim said his sleeping bag; he'd buy another mattress later on.


"With what?" I said, the venom almost gagging me.


(Now my nose was in the flames; only my eyes were left in the
cool earth above, and already my eyelashes were getting singed.)


"Because I'm not going to buy it for you this time. I'm not going
to do <i>anything</i> else for you."


(My head was in flames, my hair screaming with fire. There was
no more saving me.)


Without a word, he grabbed the mattress and half walked, half slid
it down those four flights of stairs, throwing it over the banister the

[p. <i>248</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00255&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was no fond farewell to the apartment, no good-bye note
for Liz.


There had been no good-bye note for me.


Tim refused to sit in the front seat with me.


He screwed up the directions to Casey's house in New Jersey—
our college friend Casey, who had called out of the blue to offer
sanctuary because he needed a roommate, and Tim needed another
place to run to—telling me to go way downtown to the Holland
Tunnel instead of the Lincoln Tunnel near the Port Authority. We
drove through the tunnel in silence, our arms stuck out the windows
on either side of the car, to keep the mattress from blowing off.


We got to the other side, to New Jersey, and I gunned the car to
the side of the road so I could rest my arm, just as the car stalled out.


Just like me.


"We can't go on like this," I said.


"I know," Tim answered.


We sat in silence, until I put my head down on the steering wheel.


"No good-bye note. That's how much you think of me. No note,
no letter. Not when you disappeared this time, not when you cut
your hand off, not when you disappeared in college. That's all I ever
wanted. A fucking good-bye. A thank you. Something to let me
know you were thinking about me when you left, just like I think
of you every fucking hour of every fucking day. And believe it or
not, most of those times, I love you."


"I love you, too."


"I even tried to pretend that's what all your letters over the years
were, one long good-bye note, one long love letter, but they weren't.
That was just me making up stuff, looking for what wasn't there."

[p. <i>249</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00256&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I could see he had started crying, even though we didn't look at
one another.


"You think you're the only one who's had it bad. About mother,
about everything, that you were the one with the most pain. You
wanna know about pain? I'll tell you about pain. I'll tell you about
the first time I didn't get a good-bye note, just so you'll know what
that's like. Just so you'll know neither one of us won."


I heard my own voice, in that stalled-out car on the side of a New
Jersey road, with a mattress flapping overhead in the October wind,
tell my most painful story yet to Tim.


Saturday afternoon.


Third grade.


Just weeks before Our Mother died, whether by her own hand or
not, we would never know.


Months after we wore our devil costumes for the very first time.


I was across the street from our house, playacting with Jim Poston
and Mike Willis, the boys I would later jump across the ravine to
impress. My arm not yet broken, we played capture the castle, the
two giant bushes with purplish-blue berries in Mike's backyard as
our hiding places, our parapets. I nominated myself the damsel who
needed saving and even volunteered a costume: my red cape from
Halloween, which I would combine with Tim's to wrap around my
waist to make into a medieval skirt.


I ran home to get it, throwing open the door to Porkys room,
where I had secreted my treasure trove of disguises.


There, on Porky's bed, the same bed where Tim and I would pretend
we were in the womb as we read his letters, the same bed where

[p. <i>250</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00257&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A plastic clothes bag was tied around her head.


I stopped, not understanding.


I stopped, dropped, and rolled, for the first time in my life.


I was seven years old.


Inside the see-through bag, her closed eyes popped open, but she
didn't move.


Neither of us did.


Then her hand reached up to tear the plastic off her face.


She gulped for air, silent for a few seconds, then said—oh, what a
fast thinker she was, just like the clever twins she had given painful
birth to—that this was how to get rid of a cold.


She never thought her impressionable little boy might try it himself,
the next time he had a cold.


She told me not to tell my father what I had seen.


What I had seen, what I remembered as I told the story, a very real
story, for the very first time, to Tim: the small white printed warnings
of suffocation flaking off the blue transparent bag; her nose, red,
when she pulled the bag off; and what she used to keep the bag on,
fastened around her neck: the madras print belt that matched the
plaid Easter jackets she had just bought us.


"Oh, Kim."


"Oh, Kim" is right, even though "Oh, shit," or "Oh, God" would
have said more.


"Why didn't you ever tell me?


Tim said it, bringing me back to the present, and New Jersey, and
two little twins left to their own devices, by the side of the road.


My eyes were dry now. I was looking at the past and present at the
same time.

I needed clear eyes for that.


I would not cry again, as long as I lived.


I WOULD NOT FUCKING CRY AGAIN, AS LONG AS I
LIVED.


"You know what, I just realized something. All these years, until
this very <i>second,</i> it's always just been ‘one of our belts’ she used to tie
that noose. One of our belts. But you know what? I just realized it,
I just saw it in my head: it wasn't ‘one of <i>our</i> belts,’ it was <i>mine</i>. The
belt around her neck was blue; that's the one that went with my
jacket. My jacket was blue."


"And mine was gold," Tim said, as if he saw the same scene.


"That's right."


The one thing we had that wasn't the same.


We both looked straight ahead, not at each other, only at the past.


"She used <i>my</i> belt to try to kill herself. Does it matter? Did she
think it out, decide which one of us she wanted to fuck with more?
Maybe. Maybe she just reached in Porky's closet and grabbed the
first belt she found. One more thing I did wrong, without ever
knowing it. Almost caused her to die then. My belt. <i>Did</i> cause her
to die, wearing those stupid hobo pants to school. <i>Did</i> cause you to
have a nervous breakdown, even though I don't know how. Anything
bad that happens, it's my fault."


"Jesus, Kim...."


I stopped him. "But I <i>was</i> a good boy: I kept that promise, not to
tell anybody how I'd found her. I did exactly what she asked. All
these years. I never told Daddy, I never told you, I never told anybody.
I just lived with it."


"Why?"


The answer came out immediately, although I had never thought
it before.

[p. <i>252</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00259&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Because it was mine. Because it was the one thing I had all to
myself. Because I didn't want to share, I didn't want to have to be a
twin with it and share it with you. It was mine."


Silence, on that New Jersey roadside.


"I went back to that room later that night, even though I didn't
really understand what I had seen, but I knew it was bad. I knew to
look for a letter, just like all those letters she had written to Porky.
Did she write one to us? No. No good-bye. That's why I kept being
drawn to that room, looking for it, and keeping my secret. That's all
I've ever wanted. Just a good-bye. From her. From you.


"I found her trying to kill herself, just weeks before she died.


"Then you tried to kill yourself, just weeks before....


"This.


"So that's what I've always thought: if you try to die but don't
succeed, try, try again. You do it for real a few weeks later.


"I thought that's what had happened to you."


Silence, on that New Jersey roadside.


Silence, after our mother died in the third grade. But I couldn't
keep silent anymore.


"I kept reading your letters, all weekend, just so I'd have a map to
get to wherever you were, a treasure map. I could find you, when
nobody else could."


I couldn't go on.


"Oh, Kim. I've fucked us up so bad."


"I've gone through life thinking everything's my fault. <i>That's</i>
fucked up. I know it's not my fault, not really, but the night you had
your breakdown in college, did you try to find me? I would've done
anything to help you."


I still couldn't look at him.


He couldn't look at me either, but he could talk, finally. He could
finally solve the mystery of that night.

[p. <i>253</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00260&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I was ashamed. My head was out of control. I started thinking
about Mother, about the summer, about Carrie, about Gil. I didn't
know who to love the most. Sarah, I loved her, too. But I didn't save
her. You would've saved her. You wouldn't have had a breakdown.
Maybe that's why I had mine, so I'd have something all to myself,
too. And then, this weekend. I...wherever I was, if it was in a bar
or the park, I don't know, I just kept thinking, just praying, that if I
closed my eyes and pictured you, you'd come get me. And you did."


"No I didn't. You called me."


"No, you did. The pictures in my head...you made me call you.
You made me get out of the park. I was covered with leaves."


"Like Rip Van Winkle," I said, somehow allowing myself to see
something beautiful from something so sad: my twin, covered with
fall leaves, old before his time.


I had seen that.


"How are we gonna fix ourselves? How are we gonna fix all this?"


It didn't matter which one of us said that; we both felt it. It was
the apology we offered at the same time.


"Double trouble. The Powers twins."


We laughed—no, but at least we smiled, oh, so ruefully—to keep
from crying. It was so true: double trouble. The trouble we'd caused
ourselves, the trouble we'd caused each other, without ever meaning
to. Maybe I'd just realized it for the first time: that we were both in
pain. That we hadn't intended malice. That we were doing the best
we could. That as angry, and scared, and lost as I had been this
weekend, Tim had been, too, maybe even more so. That we would
need to work together to recover.


It wouldn't be easy. There would be starts and stops, backs and
forths, but our forgiveness had to start then and there, or we might
as well just get out of the car and walk into the traffic.


And somehow, it <i>wasn't</i> the same as before, it wasn't just going

[p. <i>254</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00261&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We both had scars now.


Tim would begin the act of contrition, with an offer to take over
the wheel. "Let me drive the rest of the way to Casey's. I owe you."


It's as if he were making up for his stubbornness in the womb all
those years ago, when he'd refused to "come out" first.


I smiled, thinking that something like that could almost be true.


He got out the passenger side of the car and came around to
where I was in front; I scooted over inside the car.


"I'll get us there. I'll get us the rest of the way there. I won't fuck
up this time. I promise."


And he drove us the rest of the way to Casey's house and found
the key above the doorjamb, where Casey had said it would be.


We quickly moved in Tim's things, among Casey's favorite colors
of purple and orange and black, the colors of UT Austin, where he'd
gone to grad school.


Orange and black.


Halloween.


"You wanna come back to our house and give out candy tonight?
It'll be fun. Just till things settle down."


I asked it simply, but the world was in it: apology, forgiveness,
sorrow, a promise to do—to try to do—better.


He answered the same way.


"Yeah. That would be nice."


The house in New Jersey would still be there when he was ready
for it.


Halloween.

[p. <i>255</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00262&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It had been our favorite holiday once, a time for dress-up, a time
when devils were just make-believe, not real, a time when falling
leaves were a miracle, not something to cover a body.


Maybe it could be again.


We got back in the car and left New Jersey, making up stories
about the new world there, about the bluffs in Tim's backyard that
he could jump off, to swim to Manhattan.


Oh, how wonderful it would be, to swim together once again.


We sat in the front seat together this time, and looked out the
window to say a prayer, a very real prayer: "Blessed Virgin Mary, protect
us now, and at the hour of our deaths"—as we made our way
back through that narrow tunnel, as we had done so many years ago.
