This chapter is based on the writings of a number of manic-depressive
persons. Their stories tell us much about some
of the several types of this disease, and also about the lamentable
difficulties we physicians often have in making
the diagnosis. In many a case we remain confused for
months, partly because the patient complains only of feeling
tired or toxic, or full of pain here and there. I remember
the mildly depressed daughter of a badly depressed mother
who for half a lifetime complained only of a most distressing
feeling of fatigue when she tried to get up in the morning.
Others of my depressed patients complained only of a
stomach-ache, or a headache, and a few complained mainly
of paroxysms of fear, or distress over their supposed great
sinfulness.


The biographies from which I now quote are remarkable
for their magnificent descriptions of some phases of the
disease. For instance, Mrs. Lenore McCall's description of
the process of drifting into a depression is a classic. Mrs.
Judith Kruger's book is noteworthy for its excellent portrayal
of the type of depression that sometimes attacks a
woman shortly after she has given birth to a child. She
shows how serious a problem a psychosis can continue to
be for long months after the patient has been discharged
from a mental hospital.


Mrs. S. W. Pierce's story is excellent to show, first, how

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

John Custance gives the best description I have ever found
of the great activity of a manic brain. He gives the best
verbal picture I have seen of the mixture of sense and nonsense
that is to be found often in the thinking of a mildly
psychotic man.


Robert Dahl's book shows how distressing to a man's
relatives and close friends can be their having to tell him
that he has lost his sanity--when his only response is to turn
on them in anger and bitterness. Dahl brings out an interesting
point about entering a mental hospital. He says one of
the most unpleasant features of this is that the patient has
no idea when he will be freed--granting that some day
he will be let out again. As he says, a man entering prison
commonly knows how long his sentence is.


Alonzo Graves's book is of interest for two reasons: one,
that he supplies such good records of his several depressions,
and the other, that he gives the best description I
have seen of mental illness as it ran through a family.


Jim Piersall's story is very unusual, first, because for some
time his first symptom of mental trouble was clowning, and
second, because he had a long period of amnesia (loss of
memory) during which time he nevertheless kept playing
excellent baseball.


Mrs. Anna Agnew's story is valuable in showing that a
person who suddenly goes insane in middle life can have
been mildly psychotic and expecting and dreading insanity
from early childhood onward.


<b>A Vivid Description of a Depression</b>


An able woman, a trained writer--Lenore McCall--has given
us a vivid description of her long and very distressing bout
with depression (<i>Between Us and the Dark</i>, 1947). Mrs. McCall's
book should be read by all students of psychoses, if
only so that they may get an idea of how slowly a person can
go insane, what the symptoms are during this early stage of

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>At first, great fatigue</i>. Mrs. McCall tells us how she--a
well-educated and well-to-do woman, and the mother of
three children--gradually began to feel tired. Soon, she became
so tired that she could hardly make the effort to carry
on from day to day. All enthusiasm went out of her. For
a while, she did not guess what was wrong. As she says,
how wonderful it would have been if someone could only
have recognized the fact that her symptoms were those of
a beginning psychosis. "The signposts were there, but their
markings were unintelligible to me. I did not know what
horrors lay ahead on that road, and so I did not stop to
ask a qualified guide how I might retrace my steps to safety
--while there was still time."


<i>She was too fearful to ask for help</i>. Her greatest difficulty
was that she was so fearful that someone might see that
her mind was slipping. Hoping to avoid being put into a
mental hospital, she would not let even her husband know
what was going on in her mind. Later, when her husband
asked her fine old obstetrician to see her, she turned on the
doctor angrily and would take no advice from him. Like so
many psychotic people, she had the idea that if she could
only keep concealing her mental troubles, she could avoid
insanity.


It was not until one September when she had to close her
summer place and return to her city home that she realized
how seriously ill she was. She just could not force herself
to attend to all of the details of closing the house. But still
she managed to behave well enough so that nobody knew
that she was ill. She did this even after she had "progressed
over the border into that strange land of shadows."


<i>She became manic</i>. Then, for a while, she became slightly
manic and did too much. She could not relax, and in her
there was a restlessness which drove her on to ceaseless activity.
"I seemed to be untiring; and paradoxically, the one
effort which I could not face was that of resting. I was so
thankful, however, that my mental and physical inertia had
vanished." She did not realize that what had replaced the
depression was equally bad. "So," as she says, "I hurtled on,

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Her mind began to disintegrate</i>. Eventually, she began to
realize that her mental activity and her thinking were becoming
disconnected, like the wires of an electrical apparatus.
"For example, I sat one day doing a bit of mending
for the children. I fumbled in my sewing basket for a pair
of scissors, and not finding them, I walked across the room
to a table where I might have laid them. By the time I had
crossed the short space I had forgotten completely what had
brought me there--what it was I was looking for." As she
said, all of us have had such experiences, but this was an
extreme case, so extreme that with it she became frightened.
she saw that this sort of thing was happening to her too often,
"as though there were an ever-increasing breach between
my will and my brain."


As I shall keep noting in this book, one of the surest
signs I have found to show that a person's brain is beginning
to function badly is the person's inability to grasp what is
read. As Mrs. McCall says, "One night, reading in bed, I
realized that I was going over and over the same paragraph,
and that its content was an absolute blank to me.
Nor could I connect what I was trying to read with any
subject-matter which had preceded it, for my mind was
wiped clear of what had gone before."


<i>Great loneliness</i>. Then Mrs. McCall began to feel the
tremendous loneliness that comes to a person who is losing
contact with her fellows. As she said, "I could see people
through the invisible wall, I could speak to them and they to
me, but the mental and spiritual I, the essence of me, could
not reach them, and this was a part of the horror which was
enfolding me as I slipped into that dark and unknown
world."


Then, she found that she "was numb to all the beauty
around; it had no power to assuage the bleakness of my
mind. I sat down and, without any warning, I burst into

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Horrible fears</i>. "There is no emotion in life more paralyzing
than <i>fear</i>, no element more devastating." From then
on, fear was Mrs. McCall's constant companion, and this
fear grew into <i>horror</i>. "My fear was based fundamentally
upon a terror of myself, of what was happening to me, of
the helplessness which was overpowering my faculties." "I
began to be afraid of people, of my family and my friends."
This was "because of my inability to cope with ordinary human
contacts. The world which others inhabited, and to
which I rightly belonged, was unreal to me; and I felt myself
an alien as I trudged farther and farther into weird and
unknown terrain."


About this time, sleep became largely impossible, and
specters haunted her as she lay in the dark. Then she began
to worry about "little sins of commission or omission." They
became "heinous crimes as I lay shivering with fear, dripping
with perspiration, my hands and feet ice-cold, my body
aching with the tension that was becoming so familiar. Why
had I done this, and what would have been the result if I
had not done that? I had been wicked, though in what
manner I was not quite certain, and this suffering was my
punishment." This is so typical of the manic-depressive person.
He or she feels a tremendous burden of sin, but with
very vague ideas as to what the sin was. This is so typical
also of many deeply religious people.


<i>Fear of doctors</i>. In spite of her great suffering, she was
"determined she would not seek medical aid." She was too
afraid to see a doctor. "I was afraid to find out what was the
matter with me." She was afraid of being committed. Curiously,
if only some other part of her body below the neck
had been misbehaving, she would have gone immediately
to a good specialist in that field. "But because my brain was
the offender, I could not bring myself to enlist aid from
any source."


<i>An inability to make decisions</i>. "I was no longer able to

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then she turned on her beloved husband and looked on
him as her enemy because he kept wanting to find out what
was wrong with her. To her sick mind, he was a menace to
her safety. "I was determined to be on my guard." She went
on avoiding contacts with her children, her husband, and
her servants, "while my sick spirit ached for the human
relationships now denied me." Then she no longer cared
what happened to her. She went out and walked in the
snow until she became exhausted. She thought to herself,
"I am done for. Someone will find me, but I hope it will be
too late." "But the children, what about them? I don't want
to five. Not this way."


That night her husband found her, and then a contest began,
with him trying to get the doctor to see her, with her
objecting strenuously. When the doctor came, she was nasty
to him. And when he wanted to call a psychiatrist, she
became angrier than ever. Through the years she had
thought the doctor was her friend, and now he wanted to
betray her! So she hated him.


When a psychiatrist came, she insulted him. But, finally,
she felt that there was no longer any use struggling. She
no longer had the strength to fight. She said, "Even my
children have slipped away from me. I can't hold on to
them in my mind. I can't reach out even to my husband.
I'm shut away by myself where everything is dim and queer.
The only thing that's real now is the horror I'm in."


<i>Problems of hospitalization</i>. She was taken to a <i>general</i>
hospital for a few days. There she did not want to talk even
to her children. She didn't want to see them. She had to
force herself to greet them. Then came discussions between
her family doctor, her psychiatrist, and her husband in regard
to putting her into a mental hospital. She so rebelled
against the idea of hospitalization that her poor husband

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mrs. McCall says she had the idea that "by refusing to
accept the idea that I was going to enter a mental hospital
I nullified its existence." In many ways this is not a particularly
insane reaction; it is the reaction of many supposedly
sane people to many a medical emergency.


<i>Loss of contact with the world</i>. Christmas Day came, and
she had to steel herself to talk to her children over the
telephone. She didn't want to, and she didn't want any
presents. She did not want to see her husband. She felt
hopeless. She was sure she would never recover. Seeing that
eventually she was going to leave the children, she thought
it would be better for them if they were to be told that she
was dead. One can easily see that when a depressed person
feels this way, it is a short step to suicide. Suicide looks like
a welcome end to it all. The patient has the idea that her
suicide will help her loved ones out of a miserable situation.
"It will be better for all concerned." Actually, about this
time, Mrs. McCall broke a drinking glass and chewed up
and swallowed the pieces. They cut her mouth and her
throat but they didn't injure her much. When she woke the
next morning and found herself alive, she was much disappointed.
"The realization that I was still alive was so
bitter that I cursed God."


<i>Life in a mental hospital</i>. For the next year she improved
but little. After a while, "I no longer sat for hours weeping
bitterly; I gained a modicum of control, and settled into
a quiet hopelessness. There was less rebellion in my attitude,
because I felt there was nothing to be gained by
rebelling. I was done for," and "now I abandoned any hope

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the occasions when her husband came, she found no
pleasure in his visit; in fact, it was a torture to her. Also,
with her sick mind, she got the idea that he must be having
a love affair with her best friend. Grief over his wife's illness
nearly broke her husband down. It was agonizing, also,
to her to realize that Henry, "who had meant everything in
life to me had now no more substance in my mind than a
shadow." "And yet I could remember how I once had felt
toward him." "I loathed the spiritual paralysis which had
deadened me, and I was torn to pieces by a sense of bafflement
and failure." "I wanted Henry to stay with me, and
yet I was glad he was going. The reminders he brought
with him of what I had lost were too agonizing; the conflict
was too severe, and I was worn out."


It is remarkable that even her mother love left her--that
emotion which is perhaps the strongest a woman can have.
Later, a horrible obsession laid hold of her: "I became convinced
that an unpleasant odor emanated from me, and it
caused me unspeakable torture." No one around her could
smell anything, but, as always happens, their statements did
not cheer her. She was distressed by this hallucination of
smell until the day when she got well. When months passed
and she did not get any better, she began trying again to
figure out another way in which she could commit suicide.


Then it was decided to move her to another hospital
where the discipline would be more strict, and where she
would be compelled to live by a schedule. It was thought
that the program of activities would help her, but it didn't.
She still remained rebellious and defiant. She, who had always
been a lady, would curse people who were trying to
be kind to her. As she said, "I'm all mixed up. I only know
that I want to hurt Henry, and that I hate him because he's
well, and he's keeping me here in this place."


After nearly four years she was much worse! She was
silent and withdrawn. All she did was to try to keep up with
the mechanics of everyday living in the hospital. She became
very thin, she limped, and her face became etched by lines
of suffering.

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>A cure is found</i>. And then, very fortunately for her, one
of the then-new treatments, in which the patient's brain is
electrically shocked into health, began to be used. For three
months she had a series of these treatments. At first, the
shocks did no good, but then, one day she woke up in the
morning--well. "I sat up suddenly, my heart pounding. I
looked around the room and a sweep of wonder surged over
me. God in heaven, I'm well. I'm myself. This is I.... My
mind is working. I'm glad to see the day; the sunlight is
beautiful. I'm well. I've come back from the dead." "I went
to bed last night, sicker than I thought I'd ever been, and
this morning I'm well. It's a miracle. Tears ran down my
cheeks; warm, relieving, happy tears." "I'm going back to
everything I thought I'd never see again. Henry, I'm coming
back to you and the children. I'll make up to you the
rest of my life for all the worry and unhappiness you've
gone through the past four years."


"Also, the smell has gone, the dreadful smell I thought
I had. I don't think it was ever really there. I think I
imagined it." She doubtless did, because I have seen many
psychotic persons who were sure they smelled terribly bad
when they didn't.


One of the most wonderful things about a depression is
that it can clear away in a minute. Many a time a patient
has said to me, "One day the curtain went up, and then I
was well again."


Mrs. McCall was kept in the hospital another four months,
during which time she had to be educated "in the art of
living." Just before she went home, she said to her psychiatrist,
"One of the essential things you've taught me is
to take criticism without my stomach turning over, and
without my getting angry. That is something to have
learned."


And then her husband came and took her home. "Two
tall boys and a slender, leggy girl, her golden pigtails streaming
out behind her in the wind," came running to greet her.
"It was John and David and Emily, and I was home."


Today, if a woman who has slipped into a persisting depression
and perhaps is feeling terribly tired and uninterested
in everything, and complaining of abdominal pain

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>A Mother's Depression After Her Child Is Born</b>


Many a woman with an inborn tendency to depression goes
into a slump after she has given birth to a child, and the
best description of this illness that I know of was written by
Mrs. Judith Kruger (<i>My Fight for Sanity</i>, 1959). When she
went insane, her husband was a medical student, starting
on his internship.


<i>The slow beginnings of unrecognized insanity</i>. As she
says, long before her mind became badly disturbed, there
were occasional flurries of anxiety that caused her concern.
She was too serious about her housekeeping; there was no
fun in her work; she went at every task with tension. What
made life hard, also, was her great fear of any change, such
as moving to a new apartment.


After her child was born, Mrs. Kruger could not sleep, and
in order to get some rest she had to keep taking larger and
larger doses of sedatives. She says, "I was consumed in
mounting tension. It was like a cloud around me--a choking
fog. I had no inkling of what was wrong. I only knew that
I was more nervous than I had ever been in my life."
"Nothing looked right to me." "When my father and brother
made their first visit to us, the sight of their faces upset
me." "I moved thickly through the days. Panic was rising
and spreading like a slow paralysis." In the evening when
her husband came home from the hospital she wanted to
be responsive, but "I was different; I was a strange somebody
who couldn't see or feel or move beyond a growing
wall of fear." "Everything is closing in: steel hands on my
chest. I can hardly breathe." Then her hands began to shake,
and they kept shaking; "and inside was a great fear."


Finally, she began to wonder if she was "going crazy."
She felt dead--"cold and dried up inside." "I can't feel sex
or love or anything. Just dead." "I want to sit in a corner
and not talk; not say anything." "I want to kill myself." "I
want out. Escape. I have to get away from pain and fear."

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Hospitalization</i>. After this, they put her in a mental hospital,
where soon she was again trying suicide: not once, but
twice. She was given some shock treatments, and with these
she improved. But she still had feelings of guilt, and when
her husband tried to kiss her, she would turn away. From
the start she had no use for her baby and could feel neither
interest in him nor love for him. Her mother had to take
all the care of him. Typical of the concentration on self of
psychotic persons is her statement that when her father
and husband would make a trip to the hospital to see her,
"I would waste precious moments talking to myself instead
of to them." Then the doctors let her go home, but
she was not much happier there. Like many psychotic persons,
she got a diarrhea which lasted for weeks.


Her "emotional control was still very ragged." There was
a difficult and unhappy time during which she tried to
adjust to living but failed. She could not get along with her
husband, and she could not get along with her old family
doctor. She had some obsessions, and she couldn't sleep.
Any work in the home was almost impossible. She tried to
play the role of a mother, but she couldn't do it. She said she
was not made for it; that was all. She thought she wanted
to be free--out in the world again--to mix with adults. She
wanted "kicks and thrills." She did not want her baby, but
she could not "give him back." One evening she tried to
cook supper, but it took her three hours. "<i>Three hours!</i>"


Later, she was so nervous she couldn't listen to the doctor
when he talked to her. She was too upset to think straight.
It was six months after her baby was born, and still she was
in bad shape. She was hating herself because of her inability
to love her husband. She begged him to forgive her.


<i>More psychotherapy</i>. She then forced herself to go to a
doctor for psychotherapy, but it didn't do her any good.
Her harassed husband retreated into a shell and quit talking
to her. She began to wonder if she was really a woman.
She decided she wanted to be a breadwinner, but only for
herself. She said everyone had tried to make her into

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Psychoanalysis</i>. Next, she found a psychoanalyst and
liked him. Wisely, he convinced her that there was no sense
in her trying to run away from herself; she wouldn't be
any happier in a lonely room. With wisdom he told her
that even if she didn't learn the origins of all her fears and
phobias, she could get well. But, following out the theories
of his group, he went ahead to do what he could to prove
to Mrs. Kruger that she had been too fond of her father in
a sexual way. After the doctor had talked to her awhile, she
said, "When my father kisses me now, I want to scream. I
feel so dirty; as though I've discovered an ugly secret about
us."


She told her analyst she hated him when, near the close
of each interview, he started looking at the clock. "It's like
a door slamming in my face. I feel so shut out and shut up.
Bang! Finished! You're through! Bye, bye!" Soon, the analyst
insisted on her believing that her trouble was that she
wanted a penis! Then he tried to get her to admit that she
was sexually in love with her brother, but that was a bit
more than she could stand.


One day, she got the shakes and shook and shook. As she
said, "The worst thing about fear is not knowing why you're
scared." Then her husband had to go to another city to get
the hospital residency he needed, but she wouldn't go with
him. Like so many persons who have become dependent on
psychoanalysis, she said she just could not leave her analyst,
not even so that her man could go where he could earn his
living!


<i>She scolded her husband</i>. Eventually, she had a wordy

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mrs. Kruger said, "I've flung myself headlong through
Me, dragging the demons of hate and guilt and fear: like a
cat running down the street with cans tied to its tail." "I
have never done a spontaneous thing in my life." As she
finished her book, Mrs. Kruger decided she was feeling a
little better. One feels sure that she had a long way still to
go before she could become "normal" again.


I marvel that in so many of these autobiographies, the
person speaks often of the hatred he or she feels for many
people. Apparently, a strong tendency to hate one's fellows
is a sign of a trend toward psychosis. I know many psychically
normal persons who cannot bother to feel hatred even
for those persons who tried once to do them great harm.


This account of Mrs. Kruger's illness is so extremely important
because it calls attention to a common disease which
we physicians usually fail to recognize for what it is. Often
psychiatrists--as well as other physicians--fail to recognize
that these people only rarely can be helped with psychotherapy
or drugs. The treatment most likely to produce
real improvement in a short time is electroshock therapy.


Mrs. Kruger shows us so clearly how a person may not be
sane for months after return home from a mental hospital,
and she shows how the depressed woman loses all ability to
love--even her baby and her husband and her parents. She
shows how the unhappy woman often drives all love for her
out of the heart of her husband.


<b>A Woman Whose Depression Was Treated in Many
Ways, Perhaps All of Them Futile</b>


Some forty-odd years ago a woman concert pianist and her
husband wrote an excellent story to show how badly, at that

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I might explain that in their book (<i>A Layman Looks at
Doctors</i>, 1929), Mrs. S. W. and Mr. J. T. Pierce (pseudonyms)
described their unfortunate experiences with a series
of psychiatrists of a type such as one might well have found
before 1919. The specialty of psychiatry was then in its
infancy, and many of the exponents of this new science were
but poorly trained. In those days, most "psychiatrists" were
really superintendents of mental hospitals, whose only job
was to run the place and keep the patients locked up. They
also did much work in courts as medicolegal experts.


<i>The acute onset of the woman's illness</i>. The Pierces' book
is the story of Sally (Mrs. Pierce), a young woman who apparently
was well enough until around February, 1919,
when she began to have what almost certainly was an
hysterical pain and weakness in one arm. She also developed
a strange hatred for the mental hospital in which her father
worked as a psychiatrist. This hate probably arose when she
began to sense that she was headed for the place, or one
like it. At this time she married, and apparently was happy
and, at first, well adjusted. Seven months later, when she
and her husband left on a boat for San Francisco, she
promptly went into a terrible panic, and demanded that
the ship put back into New York to let her off. The couple
got off the boat as soon as they could, at Savannah, but
Sally was not better; she continued to pace the floor day
and night, wringing her hands in the agony of what psychiatrists
today would call an agitated depression. Although
this serious disease can easily be recognized from a glance
at the patient, we doctors commonly fail to realize what is
wrong--because at college no one ever told us about the
malady.


<i>A doctor tries to laugh off her psychosis</i>. At the first hospital
to which she was taken, the doctor tried to laugh off
her troubles. He gave her the impression that they were of
no consequence. But this attitude only distressed Sally the

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She felt she was never going to get out of bed again,
which, of course, is typical of the discouragement of a depressed
person. Typically, also, she said her life was over;
it had stopped, and she was insane. She was full of fears;
she felt she couldn't stand another day of her suffering. She
sensed that some terrible danger was all around her, and
she was filled with panic. She was afraid to live and afraid
to die. Then, as is the case with some psychotic people when
they get slightly manic, she found that she could write
poetry.


<i>Treatment with contempt and brutality</i>. The second doctor
who saw her treated her with contempt and brutality--
apparently with the idea that if he could make her angry
enough, she could "snap out" of her depression. When he
sneered at Sally's talk of suicide, she decided she would
"show him," but fortunately she fell to the floor before she
could thrust a red-hot poker into her brain. Some months
later, she found some codein pills and took them all, but
the dose wasn't enough to kill her. As a result, next morning,
she woke much disappointed to find herself still alive.


<i>Treatment by making love</i>. Then, a new doctor was found
who had the idea that what nervous women need is an extra
lover. He said, "The trouble with you, Mrs. Pierce, is that
you need another sexual outlet; to put it frankly, surely
there must be some good-looking man up at the hotel?"
This so disgusted Sally that she would have no more to do
with the doctor.


<i>Treatment with classification and long words</i>. The next
doctor who saw her loved long words with which to classify
his patients. He finally was happy when he figured out that
she was "an outstanding example of overspecialization and
of community neglect." When she did not get well under the
impact of his beloved long words, he was satisfied that her

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Treatment by glandular products</i>. The next man felt sure
that her trouble must all be in her glands of internal secretion.
He spent much time and great sums of money on every
test he could think of to prove his theory correct, and then
he started trying on her, one after the other, the different
types of glandular products. As anyone might have prophesied,
none of them helped.


<i>Treatment by a "complete examination."</i> Then, as often
happens still today, it was decided to call in an internist, to
find the <i>cause</i> for her depression in some organic disease
below her neck. Accordingly, she was put through the whole
diagnostic mill. Many physicians and many laymen still
have the idea that if someone will only give the patient
enough tests, this will in some miraculous way bring a
cure. Actually, as could have been foretold, the tests didn't
show anything, and the patient got worse.


<i>Treatment by psychoanalysis</i>. Then the husband heard of
psychoanalysis and felt sure this was exactly what his wife
needed. So she started on her hour-long sessions. At first,
the analyst had great difficulty because sometimes Sally was
so depressed she could not be induced to talk at all. Also,
she had no faith in the procedure, and she had no desire to
keep talking about herself--going again and again over what
few unpleasant memories she could rake up, together with
the apparently meaningless dreams which were of such
interest to her analyst.


For months, there was not the slightest improvement.
Sally was even more despondent and bewildered and hostile
than before, and she rarely spoke to anyone. When she did,
she begged her husband to spare her the tedium of the
analysis. As she said, she had no idea as to what the analyst
was talking about or trying to prove, and she could not
believe that he was on the right track. What with all the
talking about herself, she became more and more introspective;
and often, after her visit with the analyst, she would
cry for hours. Then, for two months, she slumped and spent
most of her time in bed.


But then, gradually, she began more often to get out of

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After many months, Mrs. Pierce began to talk a bit more,
she began to go out more often, and she began to look into
shop windows. Then she found she could take her arm out
of its sling in which she had kept it all this time. A few
months later, she began to buy some clothes, and then she
went back to playing her piano. In another six months, she
went to tea with someone; and finally, in July, 1923--three
years and ten months from the time she had become depressed
-- she came home well.


<i>A great argument followed as to whether the analysis had
worked the cure</i>. The question then was, had the analysis
had anything to do with her recovery? Her husband was
so sure of it that he had the utmost contempt for the doubts
of Sally's psychiatrist father, who said he had seen hundreds
of patients, after some years, come out of a depression in
just this way--<i>with no treatment at all</i>. As he said, psychiatrists
haven't the slightest idea why many people go
into a depression, or why they find their way out. The father
thought the analyst had just been lucky in that Sally had
happened to get well toward the end of the long time in
which she had been under his care.


The husband, with the infinite wisdom of many untutored
persons, said that the father's scepticism "would have been
amusing if it had not been so pathetic." Pierce could not
know that thirty years later few analysts could be found
who would think of going into a mental hospital to try to
cure a depressed patient. Even Freud was not inclined to
attempt that.


About all that the analyst could draw out of Mrs. Pierce
during the course of her long analysis were such facts as
that she had often failed to get along well with her neurotic

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

An old-time psychiatrist like Sally's father could conceive
of the possibility that these slight psychic traumas might
have upset a person who had been born to be upset, but
he could not accept the analyst's idea that Sally's tremendous
attack of claustrophobia, which had hit her at the beginning
of her mental upset, was due to her "fetal memory of her
prolonged birth." The analyst was evidently following the
ideas of Otto Rank, who, out of his inner consciousness,
when about twenty-two, wrote a book to show that much
mental trouble in adults is due to the terror which once
overwhelmed the infant as he or she was going through the
mother's birth canal.


Sally's analyst was satisfied, also, that her old fear of going
on a boat was a relic of the fear she had had as a fetus,
when she was unwilling to be torn away from her mother's
womb. Today, most brain physiologists would probably find
it hard to accept this idea. Why? Because they say a fetus
or an infant being born has a brain which is so far from
complete it can hardly do any thinking. This brain does
not show much of an electroencephalogram until the fourth
year of life. Actually the record is not that of an adult until
the child is eleven. Few adults can remember anything that
happened before they were three or four years old.


All in all, this book raises many interesting questions, and
every psychiatrist should have a copy to show to his students.
It should serve to keep them thinking.


<b>A Remarkable Description of Mania and Depression</b>


In many ways the best description of mania and depression
I have seen is the one written by John Custance (<i>Wisdom,
Madness and Folly: The Philosophy of a Lunatic</i>, 1952). It
ought to be read and studied by every psychologist and

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>A mixture of philosophy and mysticism</i>. Custance well
sums up his book when he says, "I have perhaps shown that
there is a wisdom in ‘madness’ which has not yet been fully
explored." He has filled a number of chapters with a mixture
of philosophy, mysticism, ancient religion, anthropology,
Freudianism, and present-day psychiatry, the value of which
is hard to appraise. It may be pure psychosis, and then again
it may some day throw light on the workings of the human
mind. Custance himself wondered how psychotic he might
still be after he had been dismissed from a mental hospital
and had gone into one of his "sane" intervals between a
manic spell and a depressed spell. He was obsessed by the
idea of opposites, as were the Chinese with their yang and
yin.


Part of this book was written while Custance was in a
mental hospital. As one reads such parts, one suspects that
the man's mind was jumping rapidly from thought to
thought, much as it does in cases of schizophrenia; but in
other parts of the book, he writes beautifully and clearly
and logically.


<i>Curious religious phases of insanity</i>. Interestingly, Custance
tells us that, as was the case with Anton Boisen, insanity
brought to him "an intense emotional religious
experience, very foreign to the temper of staid Anglicanism
in which I was brought up." Again and again during the
manic or elated periods of his illness, he "felt this sense of
a revelation of ultimate harmonies." As with many schizophrenics,
the sun came to have "an extraordinary effect" on
him. "It seemed to be charged with all power; not merely
to symbolize God but actually to be God. Phrases such as
‘Light of the World,’ ‘the Sun of Righteousness that setteth
nevermore’ ran through my head without ceasing." "I felt
impelled to address the sun as a personal God."


One day Custance wrote, "I feel so close to God, so inspired
by His Spirit that in a sense I am God. I see the future,
plan the Universe, save mankind; I am utterly and
completely immortal; I am even male and female." (See
Schreber and Nijinsky.) This reminds us of some of the

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Like so many insane persons, Custance felt that he had
become a close friend of God and Jesus; he felt that often
he was in their immediate presence. He said, "I feel that I
talk to Him and He talks to me without the slightest difficulty."
Custance said at times he even argued stubbornly
with God, and disagreed with Him on some matters. At
times he had other delusions of grandeur. In many ways
Custance thought like a schizophrenic, and yet he alternated
between mania and depression. His is a beautiful example
of those many psychoses that are hard to classify. As the
famous psychiatrist Dr. Abraham Myerson, of Boston, used
to point out, even after his years of experience with the
insane, he often could not differentiate manic-depressive
psychosis and schizophrenia, because a patient could behave
for much of the time like a typical schizophrenic and
then go into a typical depression. In many cases no two
psychiatrists will agree as to the diagnosis, and this is not
so much their fault as it is the fault of our inability to work
out a logical classification.


<i>The great conviction of sin</i>. Like some depressed persons,
Custance was often convinced that, Faust-like, he had sold
his soul to the devil. He made three attempts at suicide. At
times he was sure God had turned His back on him and
left him to Satan. (See, also, William Cowper's Life, <i>The
Stricken Deer</i>.)


A hundred times I have been impressed on reading the
writings of religious people to see how horrified they were
over their sinfulness, and yet none of them could ever say
exactly what their sins had been. When Custance kept
telling his wife that his sins were so awful as to be unforgivable,
she would ask again and again, "But what were
those sins?" And never was Custance sure what they had
been. He brooded over sexual sins which, if really committed,
probably wouldn't have bothered him at all if he
had been sane.

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I remember an insane patient of mine who was overwhelmed
with a sense of sinfulness. When I insisted on his
telling me exactly what his sin was, he said he feared he
had once been unfaithful to his wife, but he could not remember
when, where, or with whom! And yet he said he
would just have to expiate in some way; his only salvation
lay in being severely punished.


Custance, like Anton Boisen, thinks there is a place for
religion in the treatment of some of the insane. He tells us
how insanity causes a man to associate sex with religion,
and to get the two mixed up together as they have been
in many churches, both ancient and modern. Doubtless,
much of the contempt deeply religious people have always
had for sex arose in the minds of definitely schizophrenic
men and women who came to be looked on as saints. Like
many other psychotic persons, Custance felt that he was
part of a great pattern of divine purpose.


<i>A good description of a depression</i>. Custance tells us that
he was attacked by a manic-depressive psychosis in his
middle thirties. He quotes William James who, in describing
his own painful experience with depression, speaks of "Desperation
absolute and complete, the whole universe coagulating
about the sufferer into a material of overwhelming
horror, surrounding him without opening or end. Not the
conception or intellectual perception of evil, but the grisly,
blood-freezing, heart-palsying sensation of it close upon
one; and no other conception or sensation is able to live for
a moment in its presence." Custance speaks of the depressive
state as often "one of misery, dejection, and at times of
appalling horror. These states are generally interspersed
with periods of more or less complete normality."


<i>Mania</i>. As many writers who have been manic have said,
when they are elated, their brains work beautifully, their
ideas flow with great ease, and their pens can scarcely keep
up with the rapid flow of their ideas. There is a sense of
great well-being. Everything in the world then "makes a
much more vivid and intense impression than usual." Most
of the senses are heightened so that, for instance, lights
seem "deeper, more intense, perhaps a trifle more ruddy
than usual." People's faces seem to glow so that they almost

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Custance gives examples of how rapidly the mind of a
manic person jumps from one subject to another in the
process of free association. Also, a man will find himself
able to remember pages from books read. For instance, one
day Custance remembered a long passage from Amiel's
<i>Journal Intime</i>, which he had read long before. After his
recovery he checked back and found that his memory of it
had been correct.


He tells us of curious differences in the reaction of a
manic and a depressed man to dirt and filth and human
excreta. These differences may throw light on that admiration
for a lack of cleanliness which was characteristic of
many old saints and anchorites in the fourth and fifth centuries
A.D.


In one place Custance says, "At one moment a schizophrenic
friend of mine feels that he is a devil doomed to
eternal torture, and the next that he is a god presiding over
eternal bliss." With a manic-depressive, the two states remain
farther apart; they may each last for months or years.


<i>Improved health during spells of mania</i>. Remarkable is
the fact that during a manic spell Custance could do without
his glasses. Apparently, the muscle of accommodation
in his eyes became stronger than usual. During mania, his
metabolism seemed to have been so speeded up that in cold
weather he could walk about out of doors naked without
discomfort. Also, during mania, all his old great fears disappeared.
As he said, in many ways, it would be wonderful
if a man could be manic all the time. The only difficulty is
that a manic person is likely to become a nuisance to other
people about him, as when he calls them on the telephone
at three in the morning! He tends to travel about, using
up all of his family's money, perhaps getting drunk, perhaps
attacking people, and perhaps getting arrested by the
police. Often he has to be committed.


<i>Sufferings during depressions</i>. For a while, after a period

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later, when depression comes back again, these persons
go down to the depths of despair. "God has left them, and
they cannot find Him." When depressed, St. Theresa wrote,
"All the favours ever granted me were swept out of my
memory. My mind was so greatly obscured that I stumbled
from doubt to doubt, from fear to fear. I believed myself
so wicked that I regarded my sins as the cause of all the
evils and all the wickedness that afflicted the world." This,
of course, is literally what many a depressed patient says
today.


As Custance said, when a man is depressed, "It is appallingly
difficult to concentrate; and writing is pain and
grief." There are all grades of mania and depression: some
with and some without illusions and hallucinations, ecstasies,
or horrors. As happens to many people in a depression,
Custance never really lost his grip on reality. But at times
he "feared poverty, failure in life, inability to educate my
children, making my wife miserable, losing her, ending up
in the gutter as the most revolting type of beggar, and so
on." Sometimes "I was dominated above all by an overpowering
sense of fear." He was convinced that he was
finished for good and all. "There was no possible chance of
my coming out of the hospital alive."


<i>When a man leaves a mental hospital, he may not he
perfectly straightened out</i>. In his Epilogue, Custance leaves

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Custance thought it is unsound for doctors to try to teach
mental patients to be "normal"; what is necessary is to teach
them "to <i>play</i> satisfactorily at being normal!"


As I said at the beginning, this is a remarkable book because
Custance is so well educated; he is literate, and he is
a good observer. I wish thoughtful psychologists and brain
physiologists would study this book to see if, perhaps, by
his analysis of what goes on in a disturbed brain, he has
thrown light on how a normal brain works.


In his book <i>Adventure into the Unconscious</i> Custance
tells much more about his life, and his adventures during
times when he was slipping into a spell of insanity. He has
written much more on the psychology of psychosis as he
sees it.


<b>A "Nervous Breakdown"</b>


Robert Dahl's story (<i>Breakdown</i>, 1959), which now follows,
is instructive largely because he gives a good picture of the
terrible time the wife and close friends of an insane man
can have when they have to--as he thinks--turn against him,
and lose faith in him. Naturally, he resents this keenly, and
sometimes, as was the case with Dahl, he bitterly accuses
his wife and friends of being his enemies.


Robert Dahl thought his troubles began around January,
1952, but he admits that his moods had been a bit too intense
before that. He was "cyclothymic" in that at times he was
too enthusiastic, or overbold, or too self-confident, while at
other times he was too sad, or too painfully shy.


<i>The usual failure of everyone to recognize the early symptoms</i>

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

About that time, Dahl's wife, Marilyn, had a difficult confinement
in which she lost her baby. A few days after this,
Dahl decided he just had to get to a hospital. He went so
quickly that he did not wait for his wife to recover. A psychiatrist
sent him into a mental hospital where he soon decided
to commit suicide. He attempted this by running
head-on into a brick wall. All this did was to give him a
sore head and neck. Along the way his mind was filled with
dull terror. After three months he was sent home.


<i>Discharge from the mental hospital did not mean a cure</i>.
Like so many of these people, when his dismissal came, he
was not yet ready to go back into life. His wife was earning
their living. Robert still could not even carry on a conversation
with anyone. He said he could not think of anything to
say. He knew that he couldn't hold any job; he couldn't
even read the newspaper comfortably; he would look at the
paper, but his mind would be somewhere else.


Then, Dahl became tremendously interested in returning
to the Catholic faith into which he had been born. To get
back into the fold he remarried his wife with a Catholic
ceremony. But he failed to receive the great spiritual uplift
he had expected.


<i>Dahl becomes manic</i>. Then, suddenly, Dahl became manic
and decided to write a book. As usually happens with
manic persons, he felt like a new man, just full of energy
and ideas. The pages flew through his typewriter, and soon
he was working from fourteen to sixteen hours a day without
any strain or fatigue. In "an ecstasy," he wrote several
hundred thousand words. His wife realized that there was

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In his mania, Dahl had visions of organizing a great corporation,
publishing many books, and becoming tremendously
successful. He went to New York and blew in all his
savings in a few days. Then he demanded that his wife
quit her job. He wanted to employ three stenographers to
take down the thoughts which were pouring so rapidly out
of him. He told his friends to quit their jobs and get into
his huge business with him. Naturally, these friends got together
and told him that he was a very sick man and ought
to be back in the hospital. As was to be expected, this only
made him angry, and he told his friends that they were insane
and hostile to him. He turned angrily also on his wife
and said he never wanted to see her again.


<i>Another hospitalization</i>. But, willy-nilly, soon he had to
go back to a mental hospital. One of the hardest things
about insanity is that a man who so greatly needs help refuses
to take it, and only hates his relatives and his best
friends when they have to commit him. He may even be
sure that his doctor, also, has gone crazy or has "sold him
down the river" in order to please some enemies.


<i>Dahl gradually improves</i>. After a while, Dahl's delusions
left him, and he no longer thought he was going to save the
world and make a million dollars. But still he was too deeply
religious--which, of course, was a bad sign. Gradually, he
became less and less bitter toward his devoted wife.


Eventually, Dahl came out, well, and when he wrote his
book, he was regional Director of the Indiana Association
for Mental Health. There he could use his personal knowledge
of insanity to help others.


<b>The Story of Several Depressions</b>


The following abstract is of a book which is very instructive
for a number of reasons. It was well written by a newspaper
correspondent.


<i>A marvelous family history</i>. Alonzo Graves (<i>The Eclipse</i>

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Graves's father was an energetic newspaperman, a mild
manic-depressive who was a bad judge of human character
and of investments. The mother was unstable--a hypochondriac
and a difficult person who often went into tantrums of
temper and attacks of hysteria. Sometimes for a while she
would remain silent and almost unconscious. The family
were afraid of her. Some of her sisters were bad-tempered.
Graves's father and mother were always quarreling violently.
The father's brother was a drifter who eventually
was lynched in a cattle-stealing adventure. The father's sisters
were intelligent, and three of them were unusual characters
-- one of them a medium. The mother's sibs did well
enough, except that two of them had a tendency to hysteria.


Graves's elder brother, Geoffrey, stuttered. The eldest sister,
Laura, was an able schoolteacher, but she married unwisely,
and later she twice attempted suicide. A younger
sister, Edna, for years kept going in and out of insanity.


As a child, Alonzo walked and talked in his sleep, and
wet the bed, beyond the usual age. He suffered from
asthma. He says that he was able to read almost as soon as
he could talk--at about the age of three! He was markedly
myopic. He early quit college and went into newspaper
work, in which he continued for most of his days.


<i>Five attacks of insanity</i>. On five occasions he had to go
into a mental hospital. Some of these spells followed a period
of great overwork. He tells of one of the first experiences
he had when he was slipping into a psychotic state. "I began
to run into serious enhancement of the neurotic symptoms.

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>A unique comparison of the patient's hospital record with
his notes</i>. On many pages of his book, Graves puts his hospital
record, with its notes made by his psychiatrists in the
left-hand column and his running comments in the right-hand
column. There is much on how the doctors quizzed
him and tried to get him to accept their theories as to the
cause of his troubles. Again and again they tried to get him
to admit that he was homosexual, but this he denied. Often
the doctors tried to prove that his manic-depressive insanity
was due--of all things--to an occasional period of sexual
continence!


There is nothing in the record to suggest that it ever occurred
to anyone, except the patient, that his poor nervous
heredity might have had a little to do with his psychotic
episodes and those of his two sisters. Actually, Alonzo appears
to have been slightly manic for much of his lifetime.
It is shown by the great self-centered drive which enabled
him to write 722 pages about his troubles. Whenever I receive
a letter over thirty pages long from someone who describes
his or her symptoms, I know I am dealing with a
psychotic person.


<i>An excellent study-book for students of psychiatry</i>. This
book can serve as a good text for students of psychiatry
who would like to see the daily notes made by physicians in
regard to a patient who for years was going in and out of
insanity. Beginning on page 554, there is a splendid description
of life in a state mental hospital.


Interesting is Graves's statement that, like many psychotic
patients, he had a bad habit of talking "too freely to others
of personal matters." For instance, he usually told his sexual
partners all about his supposed syphilis, which doubtless

<b>A Major League Player Goes Insane</b>


This is the well-told story of one of baseball's best players,
Jim Piersall (<i>Fear Strikes Out</i>, 1955), who for month's, as
he was going insane, did a lot of clowning. He became more
and more restless and more and more talkative, until finally
he cracked up and had to go into a mental hospital. For
some time his wife had seen that he was seriously ill, but
she was helpless to stop his mad rush toward a mental breakdown.
Remarkable is the fact that Jim remembered nothing
after January 15, 1952 (when his mind clouded) until
the next August, when he came to his senses in the violent
ward of the Westborough State Hospital in Massachusetts.
Even more remarkable is the fact that during part of this
time, psychotic as he was, he kept playing wonderful baseball.


<i>His poor nervous heredity</i>. Jim had some reasons to go
insane because his mother had had several episodes when
she had to go into a mental hospital, and his father had a
violent and abnormal temper. As one would expect, Jim
had had a hard childhood, with poverty, unhappiness, fear,
and great worry over his mother. He had good reason to be
afraid of his father because of his violent outbursts of anger.
Jim's father's father apparently deserted his family, and the
wife died while Jim's father was a baby. Jim Piersall apparently
inherited his father's temper, but he managed usually
to keep it under control.


<i>Jim was always hypomanic and tense</i>. Even when Jim
was a lad in High School, he apparently was somewhat manic.
He says he could never "unwind at night." From the
time when he was fifteen, he woke up every morning with
a terrible headache. (The mildly psychotic sometimes have

<i>When he began to crack up</i>. One day, on a train, he sat
by himself staring out of the window. He was mentally upset,
physically uncomfortable, and perspiring so freely that
he got soaking wet. Later, he got the distressing delusion
that his ball club, the Red Sox, were trying to get rid of him.
No one could convince him that they weren't, and when
they sent for him to go into training quarters, he didn't
want to go. His head was buzzing, and he hadn't had a good
night's sleep in weeks. Soon after arriving in Florida for
training, he lost his memory. Some seven months later, he
had to be put into a mental hospital, and there is where he
came to. He had been cured by electroshock treatments. To
his great joy, he found that his headaches were gone. He
was released from the hopsital on September 9, 1952,
and, very fortunately, his team manager took him right back.
Fortunately, also, he could play baseball as well as ever he
had done. Later, in the summer of 1960, he had another
rough time with his nerves.


This story is interesting in that it shows the tenseness that
long preceded the nervous breakdown. The clowning was
unusual; also, the loss of memory for many months.


<b>Boswell's Depression</b>


It may be of some interest that the famous Boswell was at
times depressed. Several entries in his <i>London Journal</i>,
written when he was twenty-two, to describe the events of
nine momentous months of his life, show that there was a depressive
strain in him.


On page 253, he said, "Gloomy terrors came upon me,

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On page 319 he wrote that he complained to Samuel
Johnson that he was much afflicted with melancholy, which
was hereditary in the Boswell family. Johnson said that he
himself had been greatly distressed with it, and for that
reason had been obliged to fly from study and meditation
to the dissipating variety of life. He advised Boswell to have
constant occupation of mind, to take a great deal of exercise,
and to live moderately; especially to shun drinking at night.
Melancholy people, said he, "are apt to fly to intemperance,
which gives a momentary relief, but sinks the soul much
lower in misery."


When Boswell discovered that Samuel Johnson was also
subject to melancholia, he felt that satisfaction which many
sufferers feel when they find that someone else is suffering
as they are--"and the greater the person our fellow sufferer
is, so much the more good does it do us!"


<b>A Depressed Person Who Had Trouble
from Childhood On</b>


I shall quote only a little from Anna Agnew's <i>From Under
the Cloud</i> (1886). What I find most interesting in this
woman's story is her statement that she had always been a
problem to those about her. As a child she was proud, willful,
bad-tempered, and often disobedient. She gave her
mother more trouble than all the rest of the family put together.
She was often into devilment. Even as a child she
had days of great gloom with a desire to commit suicide.
Like Lara Jefferson, she said that all her fife she had felt

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One night in 1876, while she sat sewing, something "came
over her"; something horrible settled down over her. What
interests me much is that she says that there came the
revelation that this something "had been with me all my
life walking by my side, invisible but felt even in my happiest
minutes." "It had come and it was insanity."


It appears that in her agony she decided it would be better
for her children if they were dead. She thought of killing
them because she wanted to save them from inheriting her
insanity. I suspect that she did kill or attempt to kill some
of the children, because this would explain the fact that for
several years she was in a states prison. Only after that was
she transferred to a mental hospital. She says she eventually
recovered.
