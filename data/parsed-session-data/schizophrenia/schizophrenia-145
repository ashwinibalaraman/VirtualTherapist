BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: The iron deficient like the range is nine to 150 and I'm a six.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: So that might be the reason why I'm feeling so much fatigue.
THERAPIST: Absolutely.
CLIENT: There might be other things, but I got my thyroid checked. And while the TSH was lower than what they suggested to be, my TSH was .15 and the range was .5 to two if you're a healthy young adult, mine was low but it was higher than it had been so I'm glad I got it checked. I was referred to an endocrinologist to take me from there because I think there are a lot of hormonal things that might have to do with libido. I mean I remember when I was sort of experiencing the same lack of libido and sleepiness it was also correlated before I was treated on thyroid so it might be sort of switching around. I take two meds for thyroid, but the main point is I'm glad I went in. [00:01:14]
THERAPIST: Yeah, because it sounds like you got some really useful information both of the iron levels and whether or not your medications for your thyroid need to be tweaked.
CLIENT: Yeah because I mean I guess I forget the body is a whole balance. And I really do hate taking vitamins. For some reason I can take every other medication so I'm just going to get the adult chewy vitamins. I mean if that makes me take them it doesn't matter.
THERAPIST: It doesn't matter how they get into you it can help you with that. Are there dietary changes that you could make to help with that?
CLIENT: I saw that for iron it said eat lots of beans and collard greens, and spinach. What else? Like other things like mollusks, oysters, and stuff. And these are the things that I ought...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:02:02).
CLIENT: Yeah I eat lots of beans for one thing. I used to be like - I go in phases of spinach like I used to have eggs with spinach every night for dinner. I mean I eat a lot of those things. I eat beans everyday for lunch except for today. I was out of them so I had ice cream. I know that is... [00:02:22]
THERAPIST: It's not your traditional lunch.
CLIENT: Yeah I know. I'm celebrating my last few lunches that can be untraditional and unhealthy before I move in with Jeremy. And one thing that was really big that happened so I told my dad and my dad didn't seem to care about us moving in, or at least he seemed not to care, but he told my mom and my mom was very upset.
THERAPIST: That's more of the reaction that you were fearing.
CLIENT: Yeah and she called up and she was saying that she got a call from our godmother and my mom's goddaughter, Ginger, the girl, she was cohabitating with a guy for five years and they just recently broke up. She developed alcoholism and then she moved to India with her mom who is sort of living on inheritance money right now. And so my mom was telling me oh you're going to wind up just like Ginger. Then she's like I need a date that he'll engage by. So it got pretty ugly so finally we agreed on after I graduate. [00:03:41]
THERAPIST: What were you feeling?
CLIENT: Well I was feeling a whole mixture of things. In one sense I see that I don't think I reacted very well with my mom. She's like I know what you're trying to do. You're just trying to make him marry you and it's not going to happen. And then I felt just sad because at one point I want - I felt sad for many reasons because, I think, I want her to accept and like my boyfriend. And also I don't like thinking of the possibility that oh he's not going to marry me because maybe in the back of my head I was thinking okay I know he's a little bit of a tester. I mean I guess we're all testers. But me moving in with him one of the things in the back of my head was oh I see he's a little bit of a tester, but he'll see what a good woman I am to live with 24/7 and, of course, he'll want to marry me. I had more of an optimistic look on it instead of I'm like every other girl that's... [00:04:55]
I mean I guess I've been in that case when I was with my last boyfriend who I remember when we were looking for a places and I was like oh we were having indecisions about certain places. And he's like you know I really don't care if you want to live with me. If you don't. He's like if it's not going to work then I can just live with someone else. I'll just get roommates. And I was like no, no, no, no we'll make it work. And I remember at that point I was trying to preserve and like maybe our relationship will be better if we move in more. I mean I learned that was a mistake. But I already have a really good relationship and I have this constraint that I'm rushing around town trying to spend lots of time with him because it makes me happy. And also because my stuff's not there. I do see him... I guess it's interesting because unofficially before my mom made him declare after I graduate that summer he has to propose. [00:06:04]
THERAPIST: Is this something that he knows?
CLIENT: Yes he does. He talked to my mom and my mom said I'm going to stand in front of your door with a gun making sure that no one leaves until a decision is made. And he was like Jackie I'll give you that gun. So she was really upset. We talked last night so it got much better. And she was really trying to figure out because her and Jeremy were fighting on the phone and the reception was breaking up. She was crying. It was really upsetting. I broke out pretty bad. Maybe makeup doesn't tell it but it was just - I mean Jeremy doesn't feel it like I do because I know where my mom's coming from, and I know sort of... Well we once had a cat that gave birth to kittens, and she would drag her little kittens by whatever she could grab whether it was their eye sockets or not, and take them to safety, and throw them out of trees because she thought that was safer than climbing out of the trees. Sometimes from their experience, like mom's experience, she's afraid and not with totally no reason. [00:07:27]
Jeremy explained to her that I would be engaged right now but I really want Janet to finish her PhD. I don't want to distract her from it. And he's like as soon as she gets her PhD that's - and then he's like then when we feel emotionally ready and the time occurs... My mom's like why don't you buy a promise ring? And he's like I can promise you that I'm committed to her and that I'll engage to her. He's like but what is this material possession really going to do? He's like it really doesn't say as much as how I feel about her. I love her and I'm very committed to her. That didn't make my mom happy but it did make her like eventually she wrote me a Facebook message that she found an article in "The New York Times" that cohabitation effect how the success of marriage is often lessened by cohabitating prior to marriage. And she's like who imagines me and "The New York Times" would agree. But in this case they stated exactly how I feel only more eloquently. [00:08:50]
THERAPIST: As a scientist do you know why those two things are correlated?
CLIENT: Yes. I mean I looked up and a lot of it has to do with what's the initial intention before people move and the socioeconomic status whether it is because of convenience and I actually found the "USA Today" article maybe two years earlier that said studies have shown that there can be different types of cohabitation and that it has only a two, three percent knock on success rate when you cohabitate when you have made future plans or engagement plans. [00:09:37]
THERAPIST: One of the things often talked about in that research is the confounding variable of beliefs and that people who are likely to cohabitate tend to be more liberal in their beliefs than people who won't live together before marriage. Same thing stands for those who would consider divorce are usually more liberal in their views than people who would not. So sometimes the difference in whether the marriage stays together isn't really about whether they lived together or not but it's about what are your views on marriage in the first place. So really what you want to look at is for those people who stayed married are they happy because married is not necessarily a success. [00:10:22]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So if you're married and unhappy is that any better? It might be for your mom and that idea of being married is really important to her.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But a lot of that research looks at well what's the thing that's actually... Is this cause and effect? Is living together really having on effect on happiness in marriage or is there something else that explains both of those things?
CLIENT: Yeah. So I mean yeah and that's basically what I explained to her going into this. I told my mom actually Jeremy and I had discussed that article in "The New York Times". We had thought hard about it and we sort of chuckled to ourselves like are we setting ourselves up for doom. And by talking about it, it really sort of - because he was able to convey that he doesn't believe in cohabitating more than one or two years because you should be able to make up your mind by then whether it's someone you want to be with or not. And he said that he believes in marriage. That marriage is something that he believes is very important and you shouldn't go into hastily. And that was sort of the sign of okay that was the save kind of like sometimes... [00:11:48]
THERAPIST: It sounds like it makes sense for you. You feel comfortable with how he's thinking about it.
CLIENT: Yeah. I did. It didn't come out when my mom started accusing me the first time. But then I also explained that right now planning a wedding, planning engagement, even having a ring on my finger this would be distracting to my PhD. I have a hard of enough time staying focused when I don't have any sort of thing. I have a problem staying awake. I mean after I read for an hour or maybe 30 minutes, I'll give myself a 20 minute break of just sleeping or sometimes if I'm in my office I won't sleep. I'll just sort of look on the Internet. [00:12:36]
So I'm having a hard time getting revved up. I mean I still have a lot of work to do. I mean when I say oh I'm starting to write my PhD, like my background for my PhD, and people are like oh you should first look at the papers and look at what are the correlations between them. It's like there are no papers. And so I'm going to meet with my advisor as soon as the semester starts so that I can talk. I mean I'm running results like crazy now because I have to finish in a year. Just like I want to finish in a year, but now I have pressure from my family. And my mom actually she told me she's like you know Janet I'm still kind of pissed off that this is going on. But she's like I realize that you are getting your PhD and that is really important, and if you need someone to take care of you, make sure you go to bed on time, make sure that you're staying regular well then... [00:13:42]
Because she remembered that her brother when he was going through his lawyer school he wasn't really happy and was sort of really needed someone to tell him what to do in life. He lived with mom and dad, and they fed him, and made sure he did his homework. I mean it's kind of weird like that. I mean I used to be so motivated but now by someone just waking up, it's time to go to bed, okay it's time to go to bed. Oh it's time to wake up. Oh I don't want to but then I go to my office at 9:30 and rather than me wake up at 7:30, start working at 8:00, go back to bed 9:00 to 10:30, and then I'm reading. But still it's just not as focused. [00:14:34]
If I'm in my office I can do computer programs. There's people to talk to about science, and I really see that that's something I really appreciate about Jeremy is that he does prevent me from baking late at night when it's time to go to bed, and I'd be like oh I have a barbecue to go to tomorrow. I'm going to make an extravagant dessert which I did last night. It's very tasty but I wound up staying up until 1:00 baking, and packing, and reading. Maybe it was 1:30. So as you can see I mean it just made me appreciate Jeremy. [00:15:18]
THERAPIST: That he can help you focus.
CLIENT: Yeah. And like I even saw that for packing I'm like why does everyone pack so far ahead of time. It's like I have more than a week and a half and my roommates like no dearie you're out in less than a week. You're out on Friday. And I was like oh. I guess I never saw myself as easygoing, but I'm pretty easygoing when I'm not anxious about something, or stressed, or passive aggressive, or insecure. I know that sounds like a lot. But you know for other things I'm really easygoing about well I have moved a lot, and I guess I learned if I pack something up I don't have it. [00:16:06]
THERAPIST: You're used to packing.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: There's a lot of time living out of a bag or going here and there so perhaps you're pretty practiced at it.
CLIENT: Yeah I know. And that's another thing I told my boyfriend Jeremy. He was just like well Sheri's been there for seven years. She would have to take a month packing up. For me I just dumped out a lot of things that were old because they were cheap, or they were cheap and they were stained with pants with burnt sugar on them. And I had a number of pots that I had burnt through because I was making candy. But I guess I sort of see... I guess maybe that's a lot of things it's just getting more experience because I'm experienced with packing up. [00:17:03]
And same with my dad he's an experienced traveler as a pilot. And so he just travels with one carryon. He knows exactly what he needs. I mean he's low maintenance. It's not like he has to bring seven things to do his hair, but if you were traveling all the time you know you wouldn't need that. I know that it's just probably not a priority if you're coming and going or maybe it's just a man thing. But anyway I think I see that getting my blood drawn, having more regular check-ups just forcing myself to become comfortable with these things that are regular I think that's part of being more easygoing about more things in life. It's like having that experience of being stressed out and learning that it's okay. [00:18:01]
THERAPIST: How was the experience of doing a blood draw? I know you were very nervous about going into the room and fearing contamination possibly.
CLIENT: I was and I was... Actually it was funny because at first I was just very direct. (inaudible at 00:18:16). She was like oh you can go in the room and sit in the gray chair. And I was like I have a backpack. Can I hang it on this coat hanger? And she's like yes, go ahead, take a seat. And so I looked at the two chairs and I was like there's a blue chair and that one looks scary and then there's a gray chair. I'll go for the gray chair. She said gray chair. So I sit down and I'm just like deep breathe and sitting in a chair. She comes over. She was very chatty and then we were talking about veins and I was just trying to be in the present and answer her questions and I was just sort of being comical but scared to really talk because I didn't want to lose my focus and just ramble and then wonder. So I was like okay let's be pretty regular about this and I was like oh - and then I said my veins are kind of small so a lot of times I need the children's needle and so she got out the butterfly. And then she was talking oh you don't want to see your blood being drawn? Look it's just going really easy. I was closing my eyes because I don't like to see it. And she was finishing up the bottles and she's like oh are your eyes still closed. See these bottles they say your name on them. Do you want to see them? And I was like no. I'm rather fine. I trust you. [00:19:41]
And then she had me sign something and then I was out. I put hand sanitizer on my hands and later I washed my hands after because I just don't like the hand sanitizer feel. And actually it was another chance. It was kind of cheating. But I didn't freak out. I went shopping before I washed my hands so I considered that. I was able to cope and forget about it because I was buying tootsie pops and other things to keep me up; other candy. I have a really bad sweet tooth. It's in my office. [00:20:22]
But anyway yeah actually I mean by staying in the present I've actually - at least with the physics bathroom I've gotten really good. It almost feels like my own private bathroom because I just use it so often because I'm drinking so much tea to stay up whether or not nibble just because I'm so board.
THERAPIST: And because your iron is so low. I mean I hear you attributing a lot of this to something. You feel like you're blaming yourself for how tired you are but it sounds like a lot of that might be the anemia that you didn't realize you had. [00:21:06]
CLIENT: Well that makes sense why I've been bruising so easily.
THERAPIST: Yeah it answers a lot of questions.
CLIENT: Yeah because I was wondering... It doesn't ask... Maybe it has other consequences like why my red blood cell count is low and other things. It wasn't terribly low but it was on the lower side. I mean I don't know too much, but I know that the body does require... I mean I guess because she didn't test for other things it sort of opened my eyes to other things that might be low as well because I have a feeling that it's probably more than just iron that I probably could be low on. I probably should be taking a multivitamin. I always take my calcium chews because I love them. I love the taste of them. But I don't like - the pills are just so big. [00:22:00]
THERAPIST: Well it sounds like getting the gummy ones if that's a way that it's going to be easier for you to take it and remember to take it then that's great. That's why they made these things to make it easier.
CLIENT: It's funny that other people have that problem. I mean my dad he also - my mom gets the Flintstone gummies and my dad will just eat them like gummy bears so she has to hide them. But it's just funny how other people have these problems. I guess I'm not alone.
THERAPIST: They wouldn't make a product if only one person was buying it.
CLIENT: That would be a sad world if no one else liked the gummies. Yeah and I guess I'm curious to see how everything sort of changes once I start having some iron and it reaches new equilibrium.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it would be interesting to track how much of an effect that has and whether it's worth it to pursue. If it doesn't have the effects you're hoping we can pursue maybe some other answers. [00:23:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. But I will be seeing an endocrinologist on the fifth because that's...
THERAPIST: That's already scheduled.
CLIENT: Yeah, so I can see other things about hormones and other...
THERAPIST: And fiddle with the TSH.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well I know my mom's side just does not have a good side. I mean a good sort of genetic on her, my grandma's side including <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>. My grandma has <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> and Addison's disease which is under cortisol. She also had hypothyroidism and narcolepsy so some of these things are just running about. And I used to fear getting <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia2"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia3" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>. But now I see that when I'm not anxious I'm pretty easygoing.
THERAPIST: I have not seen any symptoms that would indicate <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia3"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia4" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>. Anxiety, yes, and the obsessions and compulsions fall under that. I haven't seen any indication that we need to worry about. [00:24:08]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Psychosis.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I guess I used to worry more about but now it's sort of just in the back of my head like it's in my gene pool but it's not necessarily something that's expressed.
THERAPIST: While there is a hereditary component to a lot of mental illness it's not (inaudible at 00:24:31) and doesn't mean that if someone in your family has it that you necessarily will. <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia3" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia4"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Schizophrenia</span></span> is just not that common in the population. So even if your likelihood is increased somewhat because of your family history, it's still a really low probability. And at this point in your life there hasn't been any indication in your life that would mean that's something that's a concern. [00:25:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. It's just something that I think I'm more like hypothyroidism is something more common...
THERAPIST: Much more common in the population, and much more common to be passed down, and very controllable. Yes you have to face the blood work, but there's a pretty easy medication regime. It's just needs to get calibrated correctly.
CLIENT: And that's another thing my sister was telling me because I told her that why I didn't check my diet is because I was kind of squeamish about the needles and the whole room. And she's like you know you should spend more time in a hospital where people are getting stuck here and there many times. Think of old people who get many different tubes inserted here and there.
THERAPIST: It doesn't make it easy though.
CLIENT: Yeah. Why are we beeping?
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: The little battery...
THERAPIST: We only have a couple more minutes anyway so if it cuts off a little bit early it's okay.
CLIENT: But yeah I guess now I'm sort of just really excited now. I'm going to move in with my boyfriend. I know I don't have my parent's support but I'm not...
THERAPIST: You have your dad's support or did that disappear when mom got upset?
CLIENT: I think that disappeared when mom got upset. But I think he's more just (inaudible at 00:26:32) than care which is really a sign. I was wondering that because normally when he comes to layovers, and he wants to visit, and have like steak salad...
