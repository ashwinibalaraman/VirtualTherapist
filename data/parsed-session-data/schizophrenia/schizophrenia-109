<b>DR:</b> I'm going to review the forms and then we're going to get started.  All right, thank you [PATIENT NAME].  Hello?  All right, thank you for coming today.  So, how are things going?
<b>PT:</b> Um, they're okay.  Uh, you heard I quit taking the antidepressant?
<b>DR:</b> You quit taking, why, why that?
<b>PT:</b> I like fell into this really deep depression —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Where I didn't want to be around anymore and wanted to give up on everything.
<b>DR:</b> I see.
<b>PT:</b> So, I quit taking it because I just, I don't feel like it's working.
<b>DR:</b> So, how long have you been off it?
<b>PT:</b> I've been off it for probably a week.
<b>DR:</b> For a week.  Do you feel more depressed or less depressed?  Do you feel any difference?
<b>PT:</b> I, I'm not in that deep depression.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I feel okay.
<b>DR:</b> You feel okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> So, what happened, when you had, when you said —
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I don't know.  See, I went to go to summer school and the, the class that I was going to take is real hard because it's four weeks instead of four months.  You have to do —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So much work in one day.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And I, uh, couldn't do it.  Didn't want to do it and not understand and, um, just I quit and I, I think that it made me feel real bad because I wasn't doing anything for the rest of the summer, and, uh, because shortly after that, I just got extremely depressed and I still feel bad for not, uh, being in school right now.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you are not, you didn't go for the summer course?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> That, that was important for you.
<b>PT:</b> It was.
<b>DR:</b> Because I know that you enjoy going to school and studying.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  I mean why, why, why didn't you go for the summer school?
<b>PT:</b> I went for one class, and it was real hard.  It was, um, biology, which I, I haven't taken any of them yet, and, uh, it just was, I could tell in one day that I was going to struggle with the class, so I decided to do it in the fall where I'd have more time to study and understand and all that, which maybe I won't.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have, do you have difficulty understanding the subject sometimes?
<b>PT:</b> Some, sometimes I'm a little slow, like I, uh, like will lose my concentration.  So I'll have to go back and —
<b>DR:</b> And do it again.
<b>PT:</b> Do it again, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, that's about it.  I, you know, did fine in, uh, Algebra and pre Algebra, and now I'm on the sciences.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So, I don't know.  Uh, I understand I'll have to just take my time and, you know, do one class at a time because I know you have a class and then a lab, and, uh, some of it, when I went for the one day, was going back on the math, which I had already forgot.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So, I, I just decided it would be better to do it in the fall —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> When I have more time.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So how do you spend your time now?
<b>PT:</b> For now, I've just been reading.  I just read.
<b>DR:</b> Reading?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What do you read?
<b>PT:</b> I read mostly like self help books.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Just go to the library and I don't really read a lot of stories.
<b>DR:</b> Do, do you go out?  Do you socialize?
<b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> I go to the gym.  I've been going to the gym, but another thing, I've been feeling just completely drained where I, I can barely take my dog to the bathroom walking.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I just want to sit down.  Then I have to, uh, lay down during the day for whatever reason, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I just have no energy.
<b>DR:</b> No energy.
<b>PT:</b> No energy.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Crying.  Are you sad?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  I feel very sad.
<b>DR:</b> Sad.
<b>PT:</b> I feel like crying and I feel like crying just mainly because I feel so bad.  Like I, I just feel drained, and I don't know why.  It, it bothers me because I don't know what it is.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I feel like it slowly came on because I know when I was in college, I started carrying this book and the book started getting real heavy, you know, and then all of a sudden, I'm not, now I'm not doing anything.  I just can't do anything.  I can barely do my hair and makeup.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  So doing the, the day to day things is becoming harder lately?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.  It's very hard.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, all right, and so you stay in bed most of the time, or do you stay home?  What do you do when you are home?
<b>PT:</b> I read.
<b>DR:</b> You read.  Other than reading, other than that?
<b>PT:</b> Other than that, I don't, I don't do anything because I —
<b>DR:</b> You go to the gym.
<b>PT:</b> And I go to the gym.
<b>DR:</b> How often?
<b>PT:</b> I go once a day.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> For about almost an hour, but it's, it's a struggle.
<b>DR:</b> Does it, does it help?
<b>PT:</b> It doesn't help anymore.
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't help anymore.
<b>PT:</b> When I first started going, yeah, I felt really confident and —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Thought like this is going to really help —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And then I quit going for like a week or two —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And the next time I started up, I didn't feel as good as the first time —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And I ended up quitting again, and the third time I started, I didn't feel nearly as good as —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Now, I don't feel like it's helping my self esteem or —
<b>DR:</b> It is not anymore?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> It is not anymore?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And we started Ambien 10 mg?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Did it help you sleep?
<b>PT:</b> It's helped me sleep at night.
<b>DR:</b> Help you sleep at night?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> So, because at one point, you did not sleep well.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> But —
<b>PT:</b> I can take a nap during the day, but at nighttime, I, I just couldn't do it.  I, I would, my mind was rushing, rushing, rushing, and now —
<b>DR:</b> What thoughts do you have in your mind?
<b>PT:</b> It doesn't matter what the thought is.  If I get excited about something or something is bothering me, it will just continue and continue and continue and not stop, and then eventually I, I would get drained for not sleeping —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And then I would catch up like a couple of days later.  I would have to catch up on it because that's what my body was doing.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you stay up because of the thought —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then the next day you, give me an example of what thoughts you have in mind.
<b>PT:</b> Um, well I used to get really irate at, um, [NAME OTHER], my sister in law I don't get along with.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I was getting very upset with her, uh, you know, alone by myself.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Getting angry, and, uh, my, you know, it would just go from there, just —
<b>DR:</b> Keep thinking about her —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All the time.
<b>PT:</b> And hated her, and suddenly all of a sudden, I got over her.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> For whatever reason.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> And, yeah, I quit thinking about her, and, uh, then it would be like school, you know, or I would meet somebody new and I would be happy and then never talk to him again.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So, just whatever it was.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Okay, any problems with the neighbors?  You said that —
<b>PT:</b> Not really.
<b>DR:</b> All of the workers in the complex.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  They, um, you know, they all talk and they'll mind their own business, but I try to just walk by.  I have to take my dog out, so.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I have to see them, but, uh, I, I, I ignore them.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Other than that, not, not as much as it used to be.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And right now, are you still taking the Seroquel XR 800 mg at bedtime?
<b>PT:</b> Four hundred.
<b>DR:</b> You take two of them?
<b>PT:</b> We, we cut it down to one.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  We, and, um, you still, okay, so now you take the Geodon 120, is that right?
<b>PT:</b> And a 80.
<b>DR:</b> Huh?
<b>PT:</b> And a 80.
<b>DR:</b> And the 80.
<b>PT:</b> So I take 200.
<b>DR:</b> And then the, and the Seroquel XR, you take just one of the 400?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you think that this controls your paranoia a little bit?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes.
<b>DR:</b> That using both of them is, is, is a good way to go?
<b>PT:</b> Right.  We cut it down —
<b>DR:</b> Because we were thinking about taking you off the Seroquel and stay on the Geodon.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm a little nervous about getting the rest of the way off of it.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because we cut it down from 800 to 400, and what I realized, what I've realized recently is that when I was having the <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> attacks, I would always say it gets me when I'm down not doing anything, like not in college where I —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Have something to concentrate on.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I think now that I've been this depressed is when the <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia2"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia3" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> would come on real strong.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> So I just wish there was some way I could get over the depression because I think I could control the <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia2" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia3"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia4" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> more because I feel like when I'm depressed, now that I know.  Back then when I was really depressed, I must have been, that's when all the thoughts would —
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Come because that's how I feel now, except for the thoughts aren't there —
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Like they used to be.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  So when, when you are more depressed, the thoughts would come more.
<b>PT:</b> More.
<b>DR:</b> That's right?  That's what you're saying.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Do you think that when we used the, uh, Seroquel XR 800 mg, was it better than using, uh, at 400?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So, you, are you, are you feeling —
<b>PT:</b> I feel good.
<b>DR:</b> Good, good with the, with the thoughts.  For the <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia3" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia4"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia5" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> part —
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You feel good with the Seroquel XR 400 —
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And the, and the Geodon —
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> A hundred and twenty and 80.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Is that right?
<b>PT:</b> I feel good.
<b>DR:</b> Feel good there?
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> But now we are, we need to work on the depression part.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Is that right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And right now, you are taking Wellbutrin SR?
<b>PT:</b> I think that's what I'm taking.
<b>DR:</b> And you take 150 every four hours?
<b>PT:</b> I'm taking 200 now.
<b>DR:</b> Two hundred.
<b>PT:</b> We just raised it a month ago to 200.
<b>DR:</b> To 200 twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> Once.  Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Twice.
<b>PT:</b> One —
<b>DR:</b> One in the morning and one at —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> In the afternoon.
<b>PT:</b> So was it 400?
<b>DR:</b> Total of 400.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and do you take it, do you take your medicine every day, or do you skip days?
<b>PT:</b> No, I, I take it all the time.
<b>DR:</b> All the time.  Um—hum.  Do you think that the Wellbutrin, when we increased the dose from 150 to 200, did it help or no?  Actually not at all.
<b>PT:</b> No, I felt worse.
<b>DR:</b> You felt worse.  Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I don't know if it has anything to do with the medicine —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But I —
<b>DR:</b> Because I think right now we have to make a decision about your depression medication.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Right now, you are taking the Wellbutrin 200 twice a day.  So, maybe it's a good idea to take you off the Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Keep, keep the, uh, Seroquel XR and the Geodon going.  Keep the Ambien going, and then we'll find another antidepressant that works —
<b>PT:</b> Right.  I think —
<b>DR:</b> Better than the Wellbutrin.  What do you think?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think that's what we need to do.
<b>DR:</b> That sound good?  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I, I never —
<b>DR:</b> Was there any antidepressant, yes, go ahead.
<b>PT:</b> I never want to feel that way again.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> I don't.  I —
<b>DR:</b> Right.  And you're right, when you are so depressed, your thoughts will come back, the psychosis is going to come back and the paranoia is going to come back and, and all the, have you been hearing voices lately?
<b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.  No.
<b>DR:</b> No.  Any ideas of killing yourself or hurting yourself?
<b>PT:</b> I, I felt that bad.  I wanted to die.  I wanted to go to the emergency room, I felt that bad.
<b>DR:</b> And you know that we are always open for crisis and, and 24 hour 7 —
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Coverage.  So I mean really, did you think about ending your life using any methods or —
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> It was just a flying thought?
<b>PT:</b> I wanted to go to the emergency room.  I felt very bad.  I, I felt like I didn't want to live anymore and I wanted to give up and when you feel that way, you know, you just want to give up.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh, so I, I, I know I'm not, killing myself is not what I want to do, but when you feel that bad, you, you don't want to live, and, uh, so I, there was no plans for suicide or.
<b>DR:</b> It was, it was just that you are so depressed feeling that life is not worth living —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you want, you didn't know what [INAUDIBLE] but you didn't plan anything.
<b>PT:</b> No plans.
<b>DR:</b> But you know, if things get worse, and, and if you need to go to the emergency room, just feel free to go to the emergency room, and then we'll talk to you.  We'll be able to handle that.  It's easier to handle it when it is still manageable rather than leave the thoughts and, and stay depressed.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So back to the depression part, were there any antidepressants that worked well for you better than the Wellbutrin?
<b>PT:</b> There was one when I first started all this stuff.  I was on Geodon and something, but the doctor that I was going to at that time, he didn't send the medical records, so I don't know the name of it.
<b>DR:</b> Do you, was it once a day or twice a day?
<b>PT:</b> I think it was once a day.  It's hard to remember now.
<b>DR:</b> Was it Zoloft, Prozac, Lexapro?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Effexor.
<b>PT:</b> None of them sound, I want to say it started with an A or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> Citalopram, Celexa?
<b>PT:</b> Maybe it was Celexa.  I think it was Celexa.
<b>DR:</b> Celexa?
<b>PT:</b> I think so.  I'm pretty sure.
<b>DR:</b> So now you remember?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm pretty sure.
<b>DR:</b> Celexa, do you, do you remember what you used, 20 mg, 40 mg?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay, if we are going to change it, we, we can, we can try Celexa.  We can try Celexa, but we, I think what we are going to do, we take you off the Wellbutrin, all right?  We're going to take you off the Wellbutrin gradually.  For example, you take, you are taking 200 twice a day.  So the first week, go from twice a day to once a day.  Then the, the next week, you take, you take yourself off it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> At the same time, we're going to give you a new prescription for Celexa 20 mg, okay?
<b>PT:</b> I just feel like, I feel like no matter what I do, that if I get on medication again, I feel like I'm going to go back to that same point, which I don't know if it's psychological or what, but I, I'm just afraid.  I'm really afraid.
<b>DR:</b> Afraid of what [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Afraid to feel that way again.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.  But that's, that's why I think we need to work on the depression part.
<b>PT:</b> So, I guess I'll just try it and —
<b>DR:</b> We'll try it.  The, the problem with antidepressants is that it takes four weeks.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  And, uh, with Celexa, there is some side effects that's kind of different than the Wellbutrin side effects.  The first one that may happen will be nausea and vomiting.  You had it, had some sexual side effects too.
<b>PT:</b> Um.
<b>DR:</b> So, it's, it's kind of a typical antidepressant, uh, but it, usually most of the patients do well on it.  So you need to be physically aware of it and then if, if something happens, just give me a call and we'll talk about it.  Twenty mg is, is a low dose of Celexa.  So, most, most of the time we need to go to 40 mg.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> So what I think is good idea to use it for the first four weeks at 20 mg, but just that's not enough by the third week or the fourth week, give us a call —
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then we, we are going to up it to 40.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> The, the other option is there is another medication very similar to Celexa called Lexapro.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, and again, it's, you can use like 10 mg and then we can go up to 20.  Both of them are, are good ones for depression, but you did well on Celexa?
<b>PT:</b> I'm pretty sure that's what it was.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So if you did well on Celexa, we can go back to Celexa, give it a try for, for three or four weeks and go up to 40 mg if we need to.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And see how it goes.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, it's, it's a struggle.  I, I know <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia4" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia5"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia6" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> is a struggle and I really thank you today for sharing all the mental history and the thoughts about <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia5" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia6"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia7" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>.  That's very good because you are open about it, and that would help us.  Um, I, I just think if, we have the day program here, uh, if you, because you're isolated —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You stay home.  I know that you don't like, you're not kind of open to social life.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I know.
<b>PT:</b> But anything that would help with, I feel like I'm doing whatever I need to do, and if there's more that I need to do to help whatever.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Then I want to do it.
<b>DR:</b> Would you, would you like to come to our day program just to, to be more —
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Because you are not going to school anymore.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So that could be something that I would really ask you to talk to [NAME OTHER] and she can give you a list.  We have several, uh, groups going on during the day.  We have the diet and nutrition group.  We have the sleep group.  We have the women's group.  So there is many groups going on.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> An anxiety and depression group too.  So, I would say, I would, if you, if you come for a few of these groups —
<b>PT:</b> A week?
<b>DR:</b> Once, most of the groups are once weekly.  So you can come, uh, for two or three groups that you kind of pick with [NAME OTHER] —
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> That, that you are interested in coming to.  Find it in the schedule and, and which you, you'll be able to come in.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, that's important too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, especially with, without going to school.  I, I like that you are going to the gym.  I like that you have your dog.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's all good news.  Uh, if you add some lifestyle changes regarding like diet and nutrition and sleep hygiene, and, and the depression and anxiety group may help too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I did that, I, um, found a chat online where people go and, you know, chat for depression.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I do that once in a while, but not much.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But, yeah, anything, I was going to ask you about the groups because —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> If, you know, you think that would help, then I want to do it.
<b>DR:</b> I, I highly recommend it.  I think it's important because I mean with the <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia6" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia7"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia8" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>, you need to be out.  If you stay at home, you isolate the thoughts and the paranoia and the voices and they come back.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> We don't want that to happen.  I mean when you are, when you are by yourself, you are not busy.  This is, this is not good idea.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Have you been thinking about drinking or anything?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Excellent.  So just, I think, I think you are trying to maintain your recovery, trying to maintain your insanity, your sanity I should say.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Which is good.  I mean I think you, you are doing, uh, the best that you can.  There is a lot of effort [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> To do this, um, but I, I think if we add the groups, and if we switch the antidepressants —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> We have a chance.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> About that.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.  Yep.  Sounds good.
<b>DR:</b> That sounds good plan?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, uh, do you have an appointment to see [NAME OTHER] or not?
<b>PT:</b> Not again, but I can call and make one.
<b>DR:</b> See if she is available today.  I think that that would be good way to, I mean if she's available today, talk to her before you leave.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And then, uh, I'm going to ask you to just sign this informed consent
<b>PT:</b> What is this for?
<b>DR:</b> It's for the, uh, start of Celexa.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Then I'm going to give you, uh —
<b>PT:</b> Um, this one?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I'm going to give you the prescription for Celexa and then you are going to take yourself off the, um, Wellbutrin gradually.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, physically, have you been healthy?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  I eat well, try to.
<b>DR:</b> Do you cook?
<b>PT:</b> Not much, but —
<b>DR:</b> Not really.
<b>PT:</b> Just little stuff, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Vegetables, fruits?
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Love fruit and chicken.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that is your favorite?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I don't like much red meat.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Have you been gaining weight or losing weight?
<b>PT:</b> I think I've gained, but I don't [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  You think that you are gaining, but with the gym too, I mean you are physically active.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> This is good.
<b>PT:</b> But I think I eat more when I go to the gym.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, because you feel like you did something, so you can, you have an excuse to eat.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Okay, this is the Celexa.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  Let, let, one more thing.  Um, I believe it's, it's time to do your lab work again.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> We do like the, uh, Lipitor [INAUDIBLE] and the CBC, CNP.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, let's do that.  It's fasting after midnight.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So, let's do your lab work too.
<b>PT:</b> Do they check cortisols?
<b>DR:</b> Uh, cholesterol.  The cortisol we don't.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> But cholesterol we do.
<b>PT:</b> Cholesterol.
<b>DR:</b> Cholesterol, triglycerides, the liver function test, the kidney function test.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> Because some of the meds that you are on, they increase your triglycerides and cholesterol, especially the, the Geodon, not to that extent, but sometimes Seroquel and Geodon.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Do you need refills, by the way, on anything?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so, but the Seroquel I've been getting, uh, still the 800 mg instead of —
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you, you have, you have too many?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You [INAUDIBLE] so you are good with that.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And we did several changes lately —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> On that, so.  Okay, any questions or anything else?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Let's check your weight before you go because I forget about that.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I gained.
<b>DR:</b> Was it 130.
<b>PT:</b> Almost 130.
<b>DR:</b> One thirty eight, 138.
<b>PT:</b> So, do I go to the nurse for the —
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you gained three pounds.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You gained three pounds.  Uh, the nurse is, is here every day in the morning.  So you can do your, uh, blood work in the morning, uh, anytime after 8:00 whenever you are able to come at 8:00.
<b>PT:</b> No eating before.
<b>DR:</b> You don't eat after midnight.  You can still take your medications and drink water —
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But don't eat after midnight.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, and then check with [NAME OTHER] before you go.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then fill the prescription for Celexa.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And, uh, let's meet again about eight weeks.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  I think I have an appointment still.
<b>DR:</b> You have another appointment.
<b>PT:</b> August, in August.
<b>DR:</b> Excellent.  So keep the August appointment.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I think that, that will be, uh, I mean a good time to check again and see how things go, but definitely, if depression gets worse or, uh, you are kind of down, can't stay by yourself, just go to the ER or call the crisis number.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what I ask you.  I, uh, kind of planned on moving with my mom a year from now.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I'm a little nervous about it because I don't have a driver's license still, so I, um, like to stay over here.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> And, um, but I thought if you thought it would be better not to be alone, I don't know.  I mean I'm a big girl.  I think I should be able to be alone, but —
<b>DR:</b> You know, what, what I'm saying, I mean I would like you to have, uh, a busy day.  I mean structured schedule.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I, I would rather, I, I definitely would like you to socialize.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I don't, I don't like it when you isolate.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So, is your mom going to be helpful, if going close to mom, I mean we always encourage family to be involved.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If mom is willing to be involved and wants you to be with her, and think that it would be good environment for you, that's good because that would provide a stability for you and then some social life and more activity to do.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So, that's, that's fine.  Um, if you think that this is a good time to do it, we can help with the transition, of course.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, where is she living?
<b>PT:</b> She lives in [DEIDENTIFIED] —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> California, but I, I didn't plan on going for a year even if, if I decided to go.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  If you, if you think that this is a good idea, we can, I mean definitely if mom wants to come in, if your mom wants to come in and, and I think that may be a good idea, if she wants to come in and talk to us about what meds are you on and what <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia7" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia8"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia9" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> means and what depression, about the depression because I mean if she's going to take care of you, so at least she needs to know —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> About this.  Does she believe that or is she going to be supportive with the meds and the treatment?
<b>PT:</b> I, I think that all my family is still in denial and they don't think I have <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia8" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia9"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia10" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>.  She just told me that.  She's here right now, but my nieces and nephews are there, so she's watching them, but —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> She still said you don't have <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia9" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia10"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia11" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span>, and I said yes, I do because I know that the meds, it's different with the Geodon than when I'm not on it.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So I know.
<b>DR:</b> And, and the thing about the, the strong point about you just that you understand your illness.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And I think today you helped us understand it too because you know what I'm saying, with that —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That was a great session.  So I think that was good that you understand and you know the importance of being on the meds and, and the meaning and what, what <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia10" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia11"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> means and what, um, the medication do for you and everything.  So, that's, that's, I think that's how you keep yourself, uh, healthy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's like any other illness.  I mean if you don't believe it, if you don't take your meds —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If you don't, if you're in denial, nothing is going to get better.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So, better face it and, and confront your illness rather than deny it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And I'm, I'm willing, if mom wants to come in to have a session with us, we can do that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Well, well we'll meet you in, in August.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But, uh, check with [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right?
<b>PT:</b> I'll do that.
<b>DR:</b> Thank you [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
