"Did you hear about Dr. Shein?" they asked.


<i>In 1967, Walter Jackson Freeman, the father of the ice-pick lohot</i>omy,
published a book called <i>Psychiatrist: Personalities and Patterns</i>.
It is a generally undistinguished overview of the profession, for
the most part a collection of poorly written profiles of Freeman's
heroes, the biologically oriented therapists like Manfred Sakel,
the inventor of the insulin shock treatment, and Ant√≥nio Egasmoniz,
the Nobel Prize--winning lobotomy pioneer. Freeman, the
archetypal hands-on kind of guy, lumped Sigmund Freud, Otto
Rank, and Harry Stack Sullivan into one brief chapter called "The
Great Theorists." And yet, in a ghoulish final chapter entitled
"Mortido: The Death Instinct," Freeman hit on something. Eight
of Freud's closest disciples had killed themselves; why? He went
on to suggest that "suicide might be called a vocational hazard for
the psychiatrist."

[p. <i>218</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00241&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Freeman was a crackpot enthusiast; maybe he was even a little
mad. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_1417');">[note]</a><div id="_note_1417" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">* At some length, Freeman dwelt on his hunch that Alfred Stanton's intellectual mentor, Harry
Stack Sullivan, committed suicide in Paris in 1949. Freeman noted that Sullivan once predicted
that he would die at the age of fifty-seven years, five months, and three days. Sullivan actually
died at age fifty-six, but Freeman pointed out that if one counts Sullivan's "time of quickening"--in
utero--then his prediction was accurate.</div> But the mad often have special insights, and Freeman pursued
this one as far as it would go. There was no literature on psychiatric
suicide, so Freeman did his own research. He combed the
obituary notices of the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association
(JAMA)</i> to prove his point. When a reported cause of death
seemed suspicious, he addressed the relevant state Bureau of Vital
Statistics, with mixed results. Although his findings were far from
scientific, they were provocative. He reported that 203 American
psychiatrists had committed suicide in the seventy years from 1895
to 1965. He deduced, convincingly, that suicides were underreported
by the medical profession and also that this seemed like a
high number. As with his hurry-up-time's-a-wasting lobotomies in
his medical office, his methodology was suspect. But yet again,
his work commanded attention.


Perhaps understandably, there is very little literature on the subject
of psychiatric suicide. In 1980, two California psychiatrists revisited
Freeman's thesis, and--unlike most of his theories--it held
up perfectly. Writing in the <i>Journal of Clinical Psychiatry</i>, Charles
Rich and Ferris Pitts reported that "psychiatrists suicide regularly,
year-by-year, at rates about twice those expected." They used
American Medical Association records instead of the <i>JAMA</i> obituaries
that Freeman combed through; the <i>JAMA</i> understated suicide
rates by about 20 percent, according to Rich and Pitts. But
even this report was misleading, because they were comparing
psychiatrists' suicide rates to <i>doctors'</i> suicide rates, which are considerably
higher than those for the general population. The two
authors even allowed themselves a moment of what must have
been unintentional levity: "The occurrence of suicides by psychiatrists

[p. <i>219</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00242&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Why do psychiatrists kill themselves? Many admit that they entered
the profession to wrestle with their own demons--"to find
out what was wrong with me," is the phrase I heard over and over
again. Rich and Pitts confirmed this. Massaging their data, they
hypothesized that one in every three psychiatrists suffered from a
mood disorder like mania or depression. This, they wrote, is three
times the incidence in the general population: "This would logically
imply that psychiatry is depressing to the practitioner and/or
physicians with affective disorder tend to select psychiatry as a
specialty. For a variety of reasons, we believe the latter to be the
case."


Mental illness can be infectious. Nurses, psychiatric aides, and
therapists are hardly indifferent to their surroundings in the mental
hospital, and many of them break down themselves. As the
doctors are fond of saying: No one is immune.


<i>It is not uncommon for psychiatrists to check themselves into a sani</i>tarium
or hospital, although they usually seek shelter outside their
practice area to avoid the possible embarrassment of meeting patients
or students inside the hospital. Boston doctors might travel
to the Yale--New Haven Hospital or to the bucolic surroundings
of Austen Riggs in Stockbridge, in the heart of the Berkshire
mountains.


But some ended up at McLean. One well-known patient was
Dr. Doris Menzer-Benaron, a prominent member of the Boston
Psychoanalytic Institute, who spent a good deal of time with the
"crazy ladies" of Codman Hall. Benaron was married to a prominent
local psychiatrist, and she had trained some of the doctors at

[p. <i>220</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00243&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another sad case was that of Julia Altschule, who was married
to Dr. Mark Altschule, a cardiologist who also functioned as
McLean's one-man research laboratory from 1947 through the
early 1960s. Julia had been a ballerina and assumed a curious Asian
affect as she grew old at McLean, diagnosed as a chronic schizophrenic.
She often wreathed herself in a black shawl, and wandered
the grounds along "Julia's path," which took her from
Codman Hall, behind Eliot Chapel, down over the Bowl, down
to the Pleasant Street Lodge and back again. Julia would occasionally
stop and talk with small children, as she did with Harold
Williams's two-year-old son. What did they talk about? "God only
knows," Williams now says. "I never heard a sane word come out
of her."


Nurse Maria Pugatch remembers seeing Julia at the head of the
grand staircase in Upham Hall, where she lived for a time: "Imagine
how spooky it was to come into this building, and there at the
top of the stairs is this short little woman dressed entirely in black,
speaking in a kind of a tongue. Sometimes when you drove into
the hospital, she would be standing on the top of a hill, casting
spells on you. Everyone said she was a witch."


Huddled in a tiny, one-room lab in a tunnel just beneath the
main administration building, her husband devoted much of his
life to discovering a cure for his wife's illness. Working with pots and
pans instead of test tubes and petri dishes, Altschule kept searching
for the biological roots of his wife's illness. He experimented with
different megavitamin recipes, occasionally tube-feeding them to
catatonic schizophrenics in the hopes of mobilizing them. He also
tried to isolate an extract of the pineal gland, which he injected into
schizophrenics, hoping for a cure. "Like all therapy in schizophrenia,
it worked in the beginning, or seemed to, and didn't lead anywhere,"
remembers Dr. Alfred Pope, a friend and colleague of Altschule's.
"The pineal had been considered a vestigial organ that did nothing,"
Pope adds, "and Mark deserved credit for putting it on the map. It

[p. <i>221</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00244&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Worse tragedies than a doctor's wife's madness were to befall
the hospital. On Father's Day, 1962, Williams, the hospital's doctor
on call, decided to look in on a young resident named
Wellington Cu, whom Williams himself had urged to transfer to
McLean from a post in New York City. Cu had been depressed
and acting strangely. He had broken up with his girlfriend and was
also having problems with the immigration authorities, who had
threatened to deport him back to the Philippines. Cu, an ethnic
Chinese, had been raised by his grandmother in Shanghai and did
not speak Tagalog. As it happened, McLean's suicide epidemic
was in full swing. Cu's friend and fellow resident Dr. John Ellenberg
thinks as many as eight patients had killed themselves during
the previous year. "There was this business of suicides going
around," he says, "and we were trying to figure out among ourselves
why this was happening." Dr. Captane Thomson encouraged
Cu to emigrate to Canada, and the two men even bought a
footlocker together. "'That will be my casket,' is what he said,"
Thomson remembers. "He was dropping broad hints. We said,
'Come on Wellington, don't be so discouraged. We know you can
get through this.' You know how you try to jolly people along and
help them out. None of us thought he would take his own life."


Mounting the stairs of Waverley House, the white clapboard
three-story colonial home where the cheery young assistant Earl
Bond had lived in 1909, Williams had a premonition of fear. "I
had the feeling that someone was dead there," says Williams, "and
there he was lying on the bed." On Father's Day, Cu had taken his

[p. <i>222</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00245&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the presence of the dead body, Williams recalls, the two doctors
had no idea what to do. "Luckily, Ellenberg had some religious
training, and he had that to fall back on. We went back
downstairs, he put on his hat and said, 'Let's have something to
eat and say a prayer.'" In a neighboring bedroom, Ellenberg sang
kaddish for the deceased Chinese-Filipino resident. "Then," says
Williams, "we wondered whom we should call first. We decided to
call Stanton and ruin his entire month." Once at the scene, even
Stanton was not quite clear about the proper procedure for disposing
of a corpse. Eventually they located an Episcopal priest
who knew how to handle these things.


"Wellington once said to me that the worst thing you can do to
someone is to kill yourself on his doorstep," Williams recalls.
"Well, that's exactly what he did to McLean." More than a decade
later, another doctor took aim at the hospital and hit squarely on
the mark.


<i>During the years that I interviewed people for this book, I joked that I</i>
was actually building an impressive archive of tape-recorded
restaurant and coffee shop sounds, what radio reporters call actuality.
And indeed, I have put together a sort of audio field guide to
clattering spoons, crashing crockery, and the repeat visits from solicitous

Bergman, a tall, imposing, bald eagle of a man, is in his mid-fifties
and has written three novels under the pen name Samuel
Shem. He is well known in the Boston medical establishment, if
not well liked. His first novel, <i>House of God,</i> was a bawdy, artfully
written roman √† clef about his year spent training in the emergency
room of Boston's Beth Israel Hospital. Relentlessly realistic
(and thus unflattering) in its portrayal of the medical establishment,
it alienated virtually every important doctor in the city, sold
well, and has since become a classic among medical students.
Bergman's third novel was <i>Mount Misery,</i> a similarly disguised account
of his psychiatric residency at McLean, where he developed
an instant attachment to an intense, cigar-smoking young administrator
named Harvey Shein.


Bergman picks up his story after his stint at Beth Israel:


I was all set to go Mass Mental [Massachusetts Mental Health Center]
for my psychiatric training. But I thought okay, I'll take a look at
McLean. Back in the early '70s, McLean had a reputation of <i>not</i> being
a place where smart Harvard Medical School students wanted to go
for their psychiatric training. It was a second-rate place in terms of
who was out there. The first-rate place was Mass Mental. McLean was
kind of this aristocratic backwater where rich patients went. They got
the second tier of the medical school people who either weren't very
smart or weren't very broad. So I wasn't too interested in going there.



[p. <i>224</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00247&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then we had a really wonderful conversation. I respected him because
he was both an analyst and he was interested in the neurochemistry
of psychiatric illness, which also interested me. He had a very
kind, down to earth, modest, humble manner and it was on the basis
of that, and seeing the beautiful grounds and tennis courts--I had
been up to my elbows in the blood and gore of the inner city at the
Beth Israel emergency room--that I said, "Hey, I'm coming."


That was in 1974, really the first year that some of the top guys at
the medical school decided to come to McLean. A big reason for that
was the new director, Shervert Frazier. He was a real hotshot. He had
been president of the American Psychiatric Association, he was an
eclectic psychiatrist, and he was hell-bent on making McLean into a
good place. He was from Texas, and he spoke in this deep drawl, and
would say things like, "Y'know, I'm going to get the best people here."


One of the best people in Frazier's stable was the forty-one-year-old
Shein. The track is very fast at the Harvard Medical
School, and Shein seemed to have covered more distance than
any doctor of his generation. Shein hailed from a middle-class,
not particularly religious family of reformed Jews living on the
east side of Providence, Rhode Island, not far from Brown University.
He attended Classical High School, the Providence equivalent
of Boston's competitive Latin schools, and then went on to
Cornell to study philosophy. His childhood friend John Livingstone,
who later joined Harvey at Harvard Medical School and
McLean, describes Shein as an intellectual plunger who would
dive into huge bodies of art or knowledge--the works of Stravinsky

[p. <i>225</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00248&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At Harvard, Shein landed a job in the virology lab of Dr. John
Enders, a legendary figure in medical research who shared a 1954
Nobel Prize for his work on polio viruses. Later, he collaborated
with Julius Axelrod, a biochemist who won the Nobel in 1970.
One of Shein's analysts, Helen Tartakoff, wrote a famous paper
about the "Nobel Prize complex" that affected extraordinarily precocious
young men, and she noted that their addiction to ever-greater
achievement and laurels could never be satisfied. Shein
boasted to colleagues that he was the model for Tartakoff's maternally
indulged, perennially disappointed superachiever.


In his mid-thirties, he reoriented his career to psychiatry and
quickly made his mark at McLean. Before he turned forty, he was
made director of residency training, the number-three clinical job
at the hospital, and Frazier seemed to be grooming him for even
more responsibility. In 1973, he appointed Shein psychiatrist-in-chief
of Upham Hall, Louis Agassiz Shaw's old haunt, to add administrative
experience to Shein's already impressive portfolio.


Starting in 1968, Shein had begun to publish research papers on
suicide. Writing with his colleague Alan Stone, Shein asserted that
psychiatrists and mental hospitals had to change the way they
treated suicidal patients. Shein and Stone argued that most patients
talk openly about their suicidal intentions and would be
willing to discuss them with their therapists. But doctors too often
were reluctant to place suicide front and center in the "therapeutic
alliance," either because they feared upsetting an apparently stable
patient or because they mistrusted their own motives. An over-concerned
therapist might become enmeshed in a "rescue
counter-transference," meaning that the therapist might fall victim
to a fantasy that he or she could save the patient's life. The authors
argued that suicide talk had to be brought into the open,

[p. <i>226</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00249&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Shein acknowledged that there are other possible avenues for
treating suicide, for instance, electric shock. But if the therapist
opts for the kind of open intervention that he and Stone espoused,
one element is key:


It is, of course, essential that the therapist take pains to make clear to
the patient that he (the therapist) considers suicide to be a maladaptive
action, irreversibly counter to the patient's sane interests and
goals.... <i>It is equally essential that the therapist believe this;</i> if not, he
should not be treating the patient within the delicate human framework
of psychotherapy. [Emphasis added]


How odd. Why would Shein raise the possibility that a suicide
counselor himself might not believe that life is worth living?


<i>The grim answer came in the summer of 1974. On the surface, Shein's</i>
life continued its upward trend. With his impressive achievements
in neurovirology and in psychiatric research, he seemed to have a
lock on tenure at Harvard. His last published paper was "Loneliness
and Interpersonal Isolation: Focus for Therapy with Schizophrenic
Patients." Shein no longer ran Upham, but he continued
to oversee the residents and was handed some of the responsibilities
of the clinical director, the hospital's second-in-command and
chief flak-catcher. "He was being pushed to get more clinical experience
so he could be clinical director," Irene Stiver said. "He was
a brilliant researcher, but he was very young. I think he was overwhelmed."
Shein was overloaded as usual, but he had been allowed
to cut back on his psychiatric load to compensate. One of

[p. <i>227</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00250&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>There were smoke, then booze, then tokes<br />
then Herc<br />
And my head were dead and gone<br />
And with Doctor Shein a lot of<br />
money and time<br />
And a few friends sticking around</i>.


One of Shein's friends from Upham, who remembers him
cheerily navigating the character foibles of the assembled
Mayflower screwballs, felt he looked sad now that he had moved
"up the hill" into the administration building. "They were promoting
him up on the hill, out of the valley [Upham], and nobody
was really all that sure that he wanted to do it," this woman
says. "He used to come back to Upham and visit. He was lonely,
he talked longingly about the good old days. He seemed very
stressed and not very happy. We all used to worry about him." A
peer who was meeting Harvey for the first time immediately concluded
that his colleague was experiencing an agitated depression:
"His hands were shaking, he couldn't hold a pen." Although it
was not widely known, Shein had switched away from his longtime
analyst Tartakoff and had begun to see Dr. Elvin Semrad, a
revered presence at Massachusetts Mental Health Center, who was
sometimes regarded as a healer of last resort. "I remember joking
with Harvey about the Harvard appointment," says Peter Choras,
"and he told me, 'For the first time in my life, it looks like the
road is going downhill, not uphill.' I assumed that he was thinking,
'It's easy now, I don't have to keep climbing.'"


On the evening of July 17, 1974, Shein invited the young residents
from McLean to his home on Ward Street, in a comfortable
neighborhood called Newton Centre. With the windows open to
the still summer evening, Shein led a discussion of Sigmund

[p. <i>228</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00251&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Stephen Bergman walked into McLean the next day and
began his usual bantering with the secretaries, they cut him short:
"'Did you hear about Dr. Shein?' they asked, and I said no. 'He's
dead. He killed himself last night.' And I said, 'Are you sure?' and
they said, 'Oh yes,' and they knew how many pills he had taken,
and what kind. I was totally stunned."


According to the police report, Shein had swallowed 500 milligrams
of chloral hydrate, a common sleeping medication, which
had been prescribed for his wife. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_25003');">[note]</a><div id="_note_25003" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">* Five hundred milligrams of chloral hydrate is not a lethal dose, leaving open the possibility
that the police report may be wrong or that Shein took the medication in a lethal combination
with other drugs. The medical examiner noted the presence of a barbiturate in Shein's blocd,
but chloral hydrate is not a barbiturate.</div> Mrs. Shein commented to one
of the officers that her husband "had been depressed lately." The
attending doctor at Newton-Wellesley Hospital failed to revive
Shein, who had apparently taken the pills three hours before the
ambulance arrived. Although the Newton police labeled the incident
a suicide, the state medical examiner, Nathaniel Brackett Jr.,
was more circumspect. He noted that Shein died of "acute pulmonary
edema assoc w therapeutic level of long acting barbiturate
in the blood." He refused to speculate whether the death was a
suicide or an accident. Harvey Shein, one of the most promising
physicians of his generation, was dead at age forty-one.


<i>The death was shocking to Shein's numerous friends in and around</i>
McLean. Many found the institutional reaction horrifying. Just a
day or two after Shein's suicide, the McLean psychiatrists gathered

[p. <i>229</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00252&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We were sitting there all grief-stricken, and the nurses are giving their
presentation. I just broke in and said, "I'm terribly sorry to interrupt
the nursing department, but I think it's very important to process
what happened to us." And for the next hour people shared their despair
and dismay in a profound way, which had to happen. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_27264');">[note]</a><div id="_note_27264" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">* Merton Kahne remembers walking ashen-faced into a similar meeting on November 22, 1963.
The clinical director, Dr. Samuel Silverman, inquired what was wrong. "The president of the
United States is dead," Kahne reported. "And they just went right on with the conference."</div>


Peter Choras remembers,


It was the worst-bungled way of managing it I had ever seen in my life,
and not typical of Shervert Frazier at all. We got into a meeting a day
or two after the suicide, and Sherv started to go through his agenda. It
wasn't until one of the more prickly people at McLean, Dick Budson,
said, "What are we doing here, Sherv? Harvey Shein is dead." There
wouldn't have been any discussion unless Dick had broken into that.
People were very protective of Sherv.... he was a lost man. Harvey
was his heir apparent.


Shein's friends blamed Frazier for overloading Shein; "People
were in a blaming mood," one psychiatrist remembers. Frazier
contributed to the atmosphere of crisis and cover-up by refusing
to acknowledge Shein's suicide. "Harvey M. Shein died suddenly

[p. <i>230</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00253&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Even though people knew that he had committed suicide, and
they even knew what pills he had used," Stephen Bergman says,


the administration position was to deny that.... At one point, someone
said to us residents--you've got to remember, these were my first
two weeks as a psychiatrist--"No, no, that was just a rumor that he
killed himself, he died of a fatal disease." That was the exact quote. I
mean, wait a second! That was really, really, really destructive to us.


But the patients knew, lots of them. Imagine how the patients felt.
He had been treating patients for depression, and here their doctor
commits suicide!


John Livingstone recalls,


I remember being over at Harvey's house before the funeral, and
Sherv was there, and this doctor from [the Psychoanalytic Institute]
was there, and they were all taking over. The story was "death, cause
unknown." There was the McLean brand name to protect, and of
course the stigma to the Institute. It was damage control, spin doctoring.
At that point, they were controlling what they could control.


Ever since he was involved in a plagiarism scandal in the 1980s,
the once media-friendly Shervert Frazier has not been meeting
with many journalists. But Frazier granted me an hour of his
time--a fifty-minute-long psychiatric hour, because at age seventy-nine
he was still seeing many patients--with no strings attached.
He was as Bergman described him: intensely charming, intelligent,
and above all, <i>Texan</i>--tall, gregarious, and outgoing--the kind of

[p. <i>231</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00254&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is no question that one cannot ask a psychiatrist, and Frazier
evinced no difficulty in talking about Harvey Shein. "He was
admired and revered here," Frazier told me. "He was extremely
bright, a good clinician and a good teacher." Shein's suicide


had a great impact on me and on the staff. I was very sad. He was one
of the brightest people I ever knew. I didn't know anything about
what was going on in his mind, though I've learned a lot of it since--
that he was in psychoanalysis, he was uncovering all kinds of things,
that he was clinically depressed and that he had a couple of psychiatrists
working with him and treating him.


How, I asked, did Shein die? At the time, Frazier replied, another
doctor investigated Shein's death and concluded that it was
accidental. "Now that I look back on it, I think maybe he had the
feeling that because I was relatively new here, I didn't need to suffer
the shock of suicide of a senior staff person. I think it was
probably a suicide, if I had to add everything up that I've learned
since."


Shein's colleagues traveled to Rhode Island to hear him eulogized
at the Sugarman Funeral Home in Providence. "I went to
his funeral, and I have never seen so many people crying in a funeral
room in my life," remembers Dr. Edward Daniels. "The people
I was sitting with didn't just sob, they were wailing." When
discussing his friend's death, John Livingstone remembered Harvey's
fascination with Wittgenstein and with Wittgenstein's contention
that language could be a straitjacket that limited our
ability to understand and describe the world. "Here's an example,"
Livingstone said to me:

[p. <i>232</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387547-I00255&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Why did Harvey Shein commit suicide?


Well, we know the cause of his death; he killed himself because he
swallowed an overdose. We can certainly come up with some reasons
why he killed himself: He was overinvested in his career, he was losing
ground in his personal relations. Or maybe it's a false question.
Maybe it's not a question at all, but a statement of our own pain.
