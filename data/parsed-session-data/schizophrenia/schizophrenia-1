COUNSELOR: Number seven. November 4 1970. Client 0324-006. Session number seven. 


PATIENT: Counseling places and stuff like that. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. 


PATIENT: And I guess you're the first one that kind of recommended this place to me. At all. And that I heard anything positive about it from. So. 


COUNSELOR: Okay. So it's like it doesn't make you that uncomfortable if you encounter people that you know here, it's just that you didn't want to be in therapy with them. Or wouldn't want to discuss with them. 


PATIENT: Well it depends on who I know. I mean -  I know. 


COUNSELOR: No that's okay. (Inaudible at 0:00:41.0)


PATIENT: And some other people. I don't particularly care to run into. That's all. 


COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:00:48.1)


PATIENT: (Long pause from 0:00:57.4 to 0:01:00.5) It's really funny I feel pretty good about being here. You know? I just think, four o'clock I just came so close to just calling and saying that I couldn't come. Because I just didn't care to talk at all. 


COUNSELOR: Would you say it is possible to -  you didn't feel like talking. To come and not talk? To sit and not talk? 


PATIENT: (Long pause from 0:01:25.2 to 0:01:37.1) It would be very hard. If I'm sitting and not talking, then or taking part in what's going on or something like that, then I just want to get away. [0:01:53.1]


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. 


PATIENT: And like, I really wanted my roommate, since she's never really home because she's always living at her boyfriend's, came home today. During the day. And I really didn't want to talk to her. Because she just depresses me like anything. And she's always kind of complaining about everything I do is not right. The last thing I wanted was to start a conversation with her. 


COUNSELOR: Okay. 


PATIENT: And so I just let her sit there reading the paper. Or something like that. Trying to say the absolute minimum. And it was just really hard. Because I really wanted to escape and yet not let her think that I was running away from her because she's really sensitive. To rejection. And is probably more screwed up than I am in that sense. 


COUNSELOR: But is that in some way how you were, I jumped ahead and assumed that that's how you were feeling at four o'clock when you didn't want to call. 


PATIENT: Yeah. I mean by four o'clock I had just locked myself in my room and just laid down and listened to the radio. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: And (Inaudible at 0:02:52.8). Which I've decided is probably an even worse feeling than wanting to kill myself. Because at least then there's some kind of energy involved. And just feeling like doing nothing but blocking out the world. Not even having the energy to feel like doing anything destructive is probably the nth of being just really out of it as far I'm concerned. Being really on the negative, absolute negative end of - . 


COUNSELOR: You're on the what?


PATIENT: Anything. Yeah. 


COUNSELOR: Like as much -  (overlapping voices)


PATIENT: Kind of like the most like the same. That's the way I see it. 


COUNSELOR: Like as much as that that energy that's there when you want to kill yourself you know hurts in whatever bad signs it has for you, at least it's some stirring in you. 


PATIENT: Yeah. That's really true. I mean I was thinking that today. Just as I was lying there. I didn't feel anything at all. And yet in a sense it's a different kind of like, like had the other roommate come home that's usually cheerful and that I can talk to, and I managed to talk to her earlier today and I was fine with her. [0:04:07.2]


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: I mean would've been okay talking with her. I wouldn't have really been out of it. So. I guess in a sense it was just blocking out part of the world I really wanted to. 


COUNSELOR: Did something happen to, or did something happen to pull you out of it? Or did something change?


PATIENT: Walking over here helped because it was really pretty out. That's about the only thing. And oh that was a really gorgeous moon and that reminded me of my second to last camping trip which was very nice. And it was just dark enough so I didn't have to meet anybody. But I could, it was still light enough so I could kind of see. 


COUNSELOR: That sounds almost like a psychological twilight. Like nobody was pulling on you to communicate but you could open yourself up to that moon. And like be with that. 


PATIENT: Yeah. 


COUNSELOR: Like nobody was grabbing at you. 


PATIENT: Yeah I could open myself up in a sense. I could see everybody that was going past me, but they were dim enough so that almost that they couldn't see me kind of. I didn't have to interact with them. And I can usually, I have to be pretty down to not be able to open myself up to the sky or the moon or something like that. In the sense it's (Inaudible at 0:05:29.3) I think. 


It's the place to escape to if I'm feeling really overwhelmed by people in the city. Because it's the only thing that's just really beyond it. That you know darn well exists in other parts of the [country] (ph). And in a sense even really be alone. And not - somehow it's not negative. [0:05:55.9]


I don't know just what I mean by that. But I can feel really free and really open. And kind of a better side of myself. In a sense, that's another reason I was thinking kind of as I was walking over here when I was realizing I really didn't want to come. One of the reasons that I didn't want to come was that I'm getting very tired of coming here and complaining. 


Because in a sense it can be kind of a reinforcing cycle. I mean just sort of like getting angry just makes you angrier. Sometimes talking about being depressed and stuff like that just makes you equally depressed. And I just am kind of really tired of presenting that side of myself as the only side that there is. Because it's not. But it just seems to be right now. 


COUNSELOR: Sounds like two things in there. One was just the image I get is, you know if you drive a truck or a car on one of those real rutty country roads sometimes you caught on the hump in the middle and your wheels are just spinning and spinning. And it sounded like in a way that's where you felt with yourself. Like oh, you're stuck in complaining, you're stuck in depression. It underlines it for you.


PATIENT: Mm-hmm.


COUNSELOR: And then I also thought I heard some feeling about, God what it looks like to just be that kind of person. Like what it feels like to have to have to present myself to, present yourself to me that way all the time.


PATIENT: Yeah. All pretty true. I guess I just kind of, kind of sometimes if I feel that way, really depressed (Inaudible at 0:07:47.4) or something like that, just for a little while, it's not too bad. Because everybody can feel that way.


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: And kind of knowing that I can conquer it. That the other side of me can, is really dominant somehow. And is really the most real. Is alright. But then when it sort of gets around to the fact that I may have to admit that in fact this part's the most real, then it's very depressing. Not just very depressing, it's just really untolerable. Certainly very unacceptable. [0:08:28.7]


COUNSELOR: (Inaudible)


PATIENT: I mean I couldn't stand that. So I sure wouldn't want anybody else to. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: Anybody that could; I couldn't stand I'm sure. 


COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you have the experience sometimes of turning around and looking at yourself and that's all you see, when you come away from here.


PATIENT: Mm-hmm.


COUNSELOR: Or that's what you feel like you've been doing. Just looking at that all the time.


PATIENT: Well I really wasn't looking at every session. I was just kind of thinking, I was just kind of looking forward to the session today and thinking what the heck am I going to say. And thinking that I didn't really have anything positive to say. I wasn't feeling tremendously positive. I mean that's probably the main reason I didn't want to come. 


COUNSELOR: What I keep wondering about, and I always, I have to say I always wonder about this, whether or not I hear it, and what the person is saying. Like I wonder if you have some sense of how I am looking at you. Or how you seem to me. Or whether or not, whether that doesn't even matter at this point. To you. 


PATIENT: I don't know. It probably matters. Everyone is sensitive to that. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: I haven't really thought of that that much. About the (Inaudible at 0:09:56.0) 


COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) I mean just forget about it, or not worry about it?


PATIENT: Yeah I guess that was a kind of thing I was saying to you yesterday. One of the things I was saying to you yesterday. [0:10:06.8]


COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Inaudible) Yeah. Yeah and I really heard that, and I felt like I didn't respond maybe. Or I didn't convey a response. And I think it was partly because I didn't, I did hear it, but I didn't know -  conversation like that often makes me feel like, okay now there's a new regime of we'll go along, and that's that we'll go along in a new way. 


And like I really, I shared with you some need to maybe change some things or you know, lock horns a little more, but like I wasn't quite sure what to do in the moment kind of thing. So I didn't, like I didn't know how to at that point what a concrete thing I could do would be. I'm just saying like that's how those issues seem to me. But I did hear that. And like I'll try more to let you know, I'm not aware of holding back any feeling I had about you before. Opinion (Inaudible at 0:10:59.0). 


PATIENT: (Long pause from 0:11:02.2 to 0:11:41.8) I don't know really what to say. The temptation is so strong just to escape in fantasy. It's just fantastic. 


COUNSELOR: Would you do that and tell me what that is? Does escaping into fantasy mean leaving, does it really mean leaving this situation? [0:12:04.1]


PATIENT: Well in this case it does. It doesn't always. If I'm really happy or something like that I can dream about or imagine my sort of plan or something like that, all kinds of things, and I'd be happy to share it with whomever I'm with. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think, there's something I keep missing. I'm beginning to feel like a blockhead. I sense that, I sense myself having asked you about a half a dozen times, well you could tell somebody about it, could you tell me about it. Could you share it? It was kind of beating me over the head. But the essence of this and maybe some other ways that you are, it means not sharing. It means no talking to anybody. Or no communicating. (Inaudible at 0:12:50.3) That's been hard for me to hear, I guess. 


PATIENT: Mm-hmm. Essentially the no communicating kind of thing. It's not communicating only the negative side of me that I can't stand. It's like really wanting, that's really when I want to get away from everybody. That's when I don't want to write letters. That's when I don't want to talk to my very best friends. 


COUNSELOR: And you're feeling the pull of that now in some way? 


PATIENT: Somewhat, yeah. Yeah when I feel good, I want to talk to everybody. And I can. And it's really strange. I mean it's like I'm a completely different person. And be at a party or something and be fantastically verbal. And talk with all kinds of people about all kinds of things. And I can be just the opposite. I can go and not say a word. And just feel really uncomfortable with everybody. And just really want to get out of the whole situation. [0:14:02.7]


(Long pause from 0:14:02.7 to 0:14:12.6) I mean there's sometimes that I try to communicate. If it's a very definite thing that I know I'm thinking or feeling and it's not just a whole blah feeling on just part of me, which I don't want to communicate. But like if I want to ask, ask my boyfriend to talk to me or something like that. And say there's something that I really want to share with him. Or that I was really, not even necessarily upset about, just interested in, or some realm of communication that I felt like we were sort of hitting heads. And that I kind of wanted to clear up or something like that. 


Then I would, you know, at least ask for some kind of communication. And at least attempt to communicate what I was feeling. Because I would feel like there was some kind of positive result that could come from it. But to just you know, sit down and tell somebody, gee this is how I feel. And it's so amorphous that I can't even really put it into words myself. It certainly isn't going to do them any good, and it's not going to do me any good. 


COUNSELOR: That's where I'm, that's where I'm where I'm wondering why you think that. I don't mean I think it would do you any good, but I'm not clear why it wouldn't do you any good to try. Given that there'd be frustration and pain and risk involved. 


PATIENT: Because in a sense it's not communicating anything. It's communicating a state of nothingness. And what can anybody do with that? I don't know what I could do with it if somebody communicated it to me. And I have friends that communicated it to me. Or just you know whole general negative feelings about themselves and the world. [0:16:16.7]


At a time, like when I was in college, and I was really kind of, had made up my mind to be really up and on top of things. Which I was for the first two years. And really popular, and really had all sorts of dates and everything like that. And I had this good, semi good friend, that was a roommate for a little while, that just hated me. Because she was so jealous of me. And decided, you know how can I think so positively about everything, when actually, she felt so absolutely negative. 


In a sense it's just completely, well I don't know if it's completely turned around because I think she still feels negative. But I know I feel about as negative as she did then. And I could talk to her until I was blue in the face about you know, sort of just deciding to that you really could talk to all these people. And that you really weren't inferior. And you could get along with people and stuff like that. And by deciding that, you therefore could. Which in a sense is true. But given her mood, and I think the talking helped her some, but it didn't change her feelings. Not then. 


COUNSELOR: Do you feel like I'm pushing you in some way to try that with all these, like I keep asking you what it's about and do you do this, and could you do that? 


PATIENT: Mmm. Somewhat. Except that it's impossible. Because I don't have anyone to try it with. I mean even trying it with you is just really getting to me. And I don't really have any good friends in the city that I could try it with. And-[0:18:03.4]


COUNSELOR: I didn't know if getting to you meant like it just felt impossible for you to talk to me. 


PATIENT: Well I just (Long pause from 0:18:11.8 to0:18:19.0). I just don't want to. (Inaudible) (Long pause from 0:18:25.0 to 0:18:58.9) I think part of the problem is I hate that I just feel absolutely completely undirected right now. Towards anything. And this is really so cynical about psychology and about-.


I was just like I was, I went over to some friends last night. To watch the elections. And the girl used to work for [Wetman] (ph) (sp) and therefore knew a lot of psychologists, clinical students, but wasn't a clinical student herself. So she was talking to some of them and they were just talking about what a good living they could make off of it. And just, you know, really great altruistic reasons. 


Humanistic reasons for being in psychology. And she was just so turned off by the whole thing. I sort of agree with her. Yeah I met a lot of people like that too. And you know I keep kind of deciding, well, do I really want to get into anything like that? That there are so many negative feelings about. [0:20:06.0]


And I think if I could decide that I did, I could do like fine. Like yesterday I had my first family in family therapy. And it was fantastic. And it was really, really good. And it was something that I had been asking for so long. And my supervisor said, "Well you know." And I finally got another student that was a couple of levels ahead of me, and I said, "Look I want to be a therapist. Will you be a co-therapist with me?" And he said, yeah he was looking for a co-therapist and he'd get us a family. Which he did. And it just worked out so well. 


And like I was really so excited about it because there was so much potential. To work with this family. They just keep coming. And I felt really good about it. Like I'd never worked with a family before. And in a sense really had no supervision and nobody telling me how to go about it or anything else. And yet for the most part I think I said the right things. And managed to bring up some really important things on the part of these people. 


And you know like that sort of -  I was really, I had, I couldn't sleep the night before. Because I'd slept all day on Monday. So I couldn't go to sleep Monday night until like two-thirty in the morning. And I got up at six-thirty. And it didn't bother me at all. Like I was really wide awake. And I was really looking forward to going to work. And somehow that whole day I managed to stay busy and get everything done. And it was really a good thing. And today I couldn't face going to work. Because I knew there was nothing whatsoever to do except go over some stupid tests for the supervisor that was the worst cynic I've ever seen. And I think I know more about testing than he does. [0:22:08.2]


And just mostly for the sake of doing it because he decided I need a certain amount of experience. And he doesn't really have anything else to offer me is the main thing. And I don't want to put in my $500 that way. And - I don't know. If I could somehow make myself start finding things that I was really interested in and that I really felt that I could do something worthwhile. Then I think these days wouldn't occur. When I felt so absolutely (out of it) (ph). And I think I would have, I would not need boyfriends that didn't care or anything else. 


COUNSELOR: To be on topic, you're questioning in some way, or like there's something that's not sustaining about being a psychologist. That they have [cornicion] (ph) and that sounds very intellectual in a way. But like there ought to be something there when you're not really in with the family and excited. Like that, okay that's good. You know that's good. 


PATIENT: Mm-hmm.


COUNSELOR: But there's something that turns you that sounds like it's both missing and other things that really kind of turn you off later about the whole enterprise or something. 


PATIENT: Well it's just that so much of the enterprise, as I've run into it, is just so bad. I mean it's just, it's not doing a damn thing to help anybody. And it's glossing over problems. It's putting them in very simplistic terms. It's not dealing with people as whole people. It's labeling people schizophrenic and giving them a drug and turning them away. And that kind of thing. And that's the part I don't want to be involved in. [0:24:20.4]


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. 


PATIENT: And just, you know, sort of like makes me rebel against the quote system that makes you go through with all of these great training experiences. At the same time not giving you a damn bit of training as far as being a therapist itself. And as far as really understanding these people that become things that you're working with. And it's like you really have to fight for any kind of decent supervision. As far as working with a family or working with a group, or working with a person. But oh you can get all kinds of quote supervision. 


COUNSELOR: On things like your Rorschach and - ?


PATIENT: Which is not really supervision, it's a kind of a overseeing, counting how many Rorschachs you've given that day, or something like that. And there are lots of staff around to assign new cases to do something like that. And to spend hours just bullshitting about the clinical program or something like that. And, anyway. I just, I guess it's really kind of maddening. Because like right now I'm not qualified and I'm not skilled to go out and start working with people in groups or anything like that myself. I have to stay around and get trained. And yet I'm not getting trained. [0:25:58.8]


COUNSELOR: Account on how you're going to get there. 


PATIENT: And I'm really, it's really a kind of a bad thing. Because I really believe in being somehow like really professionally competent. And more than competent. I mean I've got all kinds standards of perfection and that kind of stuff. Which is in a way why probably my boyfriend and I just rub heads, knock heads all the time. Because he's probably you know like doing excellently in his law work and accomplishing all kinds of things. And I just haven't been able to feel that way. As a psychologist. And I don't respect myself and I can't expect him to respect me. And at the same time I don't even great avocation that I can feel really comfortable with. 


COUNSELOR: Well it almost sounded like you feel you're involved with something slightly dirty or sordid. Sordid is the word I wanted I guess. At least the way you're having to do it. 


PATIENT: Somehow it's becoming that way, yeah. Namely you get paid for putting in a certain number of hours and for checking in at the time clock at eight o' clock. Sitting around for an hour because there's nothing go on at eight o' clock and nobody else is in at eight o' clock. And rather than thinking about the good that you do for anybody or the amount of real understanding of personalities or something like that. 


My supervisor is continually criticizing my reports because I don't label anybody. In any category. I haven't read enough books on what the symptoms of <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> are and all the different kinds and why this guy should be classified as that. Instead I go much more into the dynamics of how he's functioning and why he's functioning that way. [0:28:17.3]


And kind of, like my supervisor says, "You really have a great empathic understanding of all these people, don't you?" Because I'll write pages about just how this guy feels and why he's functioning this way. 


COUNSELOR: When she says that it has a negative tinge to it. 


PATIENT: Yeah of course. I mean like you know I'll say well, I've got to give you this that you can you know, maybe this guy really isn't paranoid schizophrenic like my supervisor thinks almost everybody is maybe. His escape into religion does have bearing on his race and his intellect and interaction with the culture and the fact that he can't get along with people and this is his only way that he can be proficient. Which I had brought in. But it's much easier to label him paranoid schizophrenic. And - .


COUNSELOR: One must be succinct then. 


PATIENT: And heck, what normal person has this kind of visions or hallucinations or something like that. Completely ignoring the culture. And the fact that my supervisor doesn't know a damn thing about this particular religion that this guy belongs to. And doesn't make any attempt to find out anything while at the same time criticizing his -  Anyway. 


It just -  somehow what to me is a really good job of understanding somebody and talking to somebody and trying to deal with somebody's problems, turns out clinically, professionally, or anything else to be just really a bad thing. Or just really not professional, really naive or like he continually knocks me for being really naive or for really for looking for the good in everybody. Namely trying to explain what's wrong with them. Rather than just saying the guy's crazy. [0:30:11.7]


COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Inaudible at 0:30:12.9)


PATIENT: And you know if that's what the kind of thing that I'm going to have to do, then how do I get out of it? And yet, you know, I can't sort of go off on my own even if I go on and get a degree and start practicing because I'm not competent. And I know I'm not. Maybe perfectly competent to understand what's going on with somebody, but I'm not competent to help them get out of it. 


COUNSELOR: Yeah.


PATIENT: I mean I've tried that with my friends. And you know I just really botched things up. 


COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like you're saying, look there are things I could learn, I'm not saying that, I'm saying that all of this stuff they're trying to tell me I have to do has nothing to do helping people. And I can see what from what you're saying why not going getting into practical lessons has been a very deep disappointment. 


PATIENT: Well, it's like - 


COUNSELOR: Maybe it wouldn't have been perfect, but at least it tries, or something. 


PATIENT: Yeah. I mean it's like I can't find any alternatives for it. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. 


PATIENT: You know it's not so much this thing that I wanted and I'm disappointed and therefore I'm going to go off and cry. 


COUNSELOR: Yes. 


PATIENT: It's like where else do I go?


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: And I mean all of my co workers are like oh - -


COUNSELOR: No!


PATIENT: And you know they have a great chairman of their department or their clinical program I hear about day and night is like test, test, test. And label, label, label. And I'm not about to transfer there. 


COUNSELOR: I will never forget I had some supervisor during my clerkship who I think was from Loyola but he might've been from somewhere else, but anyway. He, I remember him telling us, when I see three M's, I just copy, he sounded like he copied out of [Kopfer]. (ph) [0:32:08.3]


PATIENT: Mm-hmm.


COUNSELOR: Very concretely. 


PATIENT: (Inaudible due to cross talk)


COUNSELOR: (crosstalk) And he'd look up and say alright when I see three M's and I really surprised I made it through that class.


PATIENT: (laughs) 


COUNSELOR: I just felt like vomiting. 


PATIENT: I can tell you lots about the Rorschach. But only by knowing the guy and everything else. Don't give me any quantitative stuff or I'll hit you over the head with it. 


COUNSELOR: Well, yeah. You feel like, at least I often felt like I was in a totally different world where I had several choices. One was to hide everything about myself that I thought was important and kind of lose a lot of self respect. 


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: And another was to try to and express myself and have people go, "huh? Or that isn't very professional. Or what about such and such. Or you have to diagnose." I don't know what any of the other ones were but it's distinctly uncomfortable. 


PATIENT: Mm-hmm.


COUNSELOR: And think the only thing that got me through it was I knew there were limits. And I could play their game when I had to. Sometimes.


PATIENT: Yeah. 


COUNSELOR: I'm not sure I liked doing that. 


PATIENT: I guess what worries me is that's all I've got is their game. 


COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.


PATIENT: And - 


COUNSELOR: So how do I learn my own? Or no I wouldn't call it a game. I don't like that. For some reason game has a bad feeling. 


PATIENT: Yeah. I don't want to learn a game. I want to learn what the hell to do when I, because there are so many kinds of people that I would really like to work with. Like I'd like to work with groups of teenagers. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: And I think I could. Because I don't ever seem to be growing old myself. I usually seem to work very well with them. 


COUNSELOR: You don't seem to be what? Growing old? 


PATIENT: Ever growing old myself. I have the worst time trying to look older when I'm working with the families so they won't think I'm their 17 year old kid. 


COUNSELOR: I know I hate that. 


PATIENT: That's trying to advise them.


COUNSELOR: Now this nice young lady will help us with such and such a thing. 


PATIENT: Yes. 


COUNSELOR: I now have such a nice wrinkle furrowed across my brow that I get away with. 


PATIENT: I wish like anything I were a male so I could grow a beard and at least look ancient. But like I don't know how to do it. [0:34:11.1]


COUNSELOR: It sounds like it, it's more than being trapped in a particular world that you don't see out of at this point, but it sounds like from something you said earlier, that this also makes you feel deeply suspicious of the whole enterprise. Like anybody who's doing any of it. 


PATIENT: Yeah. 


COUNSELOR: As far as you can tell, has to be doing some of this crap stuff. 


PATIENT: Well, I mean that's not completely true. I'm not deeply suspicious of you. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. 


PATIENT: And I'm deeply suspicious of most people, that's true. 


COUNSELOR: I kind of thought though, maybe it's not the same thing, I kind of sensed from yesterday, and maybe I thought about it afterward, like I kind of sensed that you were quite deeply suspicious of whether or not this was going to help you at all. 


PATIENT: Oh that's true. 


COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. But it's for a different reason.


PATIENT: But I mean it's not like personal, you. As much as you know questioning the process. (Inaudible at 0:35:12.6) 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Okay. 


PATIENT: But, I don't know, it's just like I know really, that I've really got to have something to grab onto. And to do and to focus on. That is not escaping from myself, but that's kind of using everything's that's in me. Which is basically and always has been basically, directed towards trying to understand people. Which I've always been trying to do. 


Because I've always had so many problems in my family. And kind of so many clashes, and so many people hating other people, all of whom I liked. And I mean from the time I was kid, trying to figure okay, you know what's going on here? And each of them can't be wrong just because the other one says that he is. Or she is. [0:36:17.3]


COUNSELOR: It sounds like you had an intuitive feel for a lot of the dynamic issues or psychological issues very early. And like you're really socialized in that. Or that's just a part of you. 


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: Because that was part of surviving for you. Or learning to have some order. 


PATIENT: Right. 


COUNSELOR: But like, so it's like okay I even have these instruments in some way inside me, I mean instruments in the sense you'd define musical instruments.


PATIENT: Right.


COUNSELOR: But like how I am I going to -  Like God I can't even tune it up. Because now I have to learn it from scratch but I have no acceptance of it almost. Or there is no acceptance almost. 


PATIENT: Kind of. Kind of the problem is like the only structure that I've really grown up with is kind of not accepting anything. Because it always had an opposite as far as style of life or something like that. I mean when I was growing up my mother was like a Catholic and my stepmother was a very fastidious Southern Baptist who was very cold in contrast to my mother being very warm at the time. 


And just everything being the opposite. And everything that they tried to instill in me as far as ways of behaving and ways of believing, I could never accept at face value because I always saw the opposite in the other home. And I guess the thing that always bothered me the most, in a sense I always stand back from it. I could never be really a part of it. Because I could never really wholly accept any way of life. [0:38:10.7]


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: Except maybe my grandmother's who accepted just about everybody. Which is, she's a cool person. But what really bothered me more than anything else was everybody's hating everybody else. Everybody's not understanding everybody else. And you know just blatantly criticizing them for what they were. Rather than ever trying to understand what they were. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. 


PATIENT: And I mean in a sense this is my whole life has been taking the other person's side. No matter who it was. Whether it was a woman driver on the road that my father was criticizing or a cousin who was unhappy and was therefore failing in school and was really not no good. Or a mother who just didn't happen to have, who happened to have a different way of life than my father's very puritan values and that kind of thing. And kind of helping people to understand other people. And themselves as well. And to realize that they had all these different things inside of them. And somehow it doesn't work. 


COUNSELOR: What doesn't work?


PATIENT: I mean it's like somehow you've got to adopt some kind of a role, a posture, or something like that. And join the crowd. And stop sitting back analyzing and trying to help and all that kind of stuff because it doesn't work. [0:39:56.7]


COUNSELOR: Mmm. Like you're saying, you have to, that's all well and good, but you have to take some kind of stand. And that's what you didn't learn how to do? Or?


PATIENT: The only kind of stand I learned how to take was a very positive stand towards people as individuals. And the only ability that I ever learned was how to understand them. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: And what was going on with them. And the only value I ever had was that. I mean as a result of which I would fail exams, not fail exams, but not do term papers so I could talk to somebody that needed talking to at the time. I mean this was before I was really screwed up and would just really get inside myself. Or like spend a whole lot of time just really upset and feeling really sorry for my aunt or something like that. And kind of being really into her whole realm of feelings. 


This was when I was like a teenager and she was going through hell. And really put me through hell. But I didn't blame her then at all. Because I really felt sorry for her. And somehow you know, ideally, I should be able to use this. Which is really me. Which is all that I want to do. To like really work with people. Because that's really all I'm capable of doing and the thing that I'm really best at. When I'm at my best. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. 


PATIENT: Or when I'm kind of my natural self. It's just like being really outgoing, but honest. I mean like I never got the Southern sickly sweetness, at all. And but I don't know that I can have that. Because I don't know that I - certainly that's not what this university wants out of you. [0:42:07.2]


They want some kind of a nice research project that'll give them good quantitative results and give you a doctorate so you can go off and do whatever you want. Even if you still don't know how to talk to people or do therapy or anything else. If that's what you (Inaudible at 0:42:24.2). 


And it's really funny. I was just reading an article in the paper today about this convent that was helping delinquent girls. And I just had this really strong urge to join a convent that was doing something like this. Because they were actually doing something and they weren't criticizing other people. And it was some kind of sanctioned way to actually accomplish something. And I know I'd make a really lousy nun. 


COUNSELOR: (chuckles)


PATIENT: But - 


COUNSELOR: So you're saying that it might be worth it, at least they're doing something, they have, they're not involved in this other crap. 


PATIENT: Yeah.


COUNSELOR: They need to do for other people and they go do it. 


PATIENT: I mean they have a recognized role. I mean they're not some kind of a freak that's trying to work, do anything on her own, which I've decided you can't do. And you just get frustrated doing it. And you just end up feeling fantastically alone. And yet at the same time there's not the pomposity of going out and getting a degree and becoming a great scholar or something like that. Or trying to outdo your colleagues in rank or professorship level or job level. Or something like that. Or salary scale. Or how much politicking you can do in whatever's going on. [0:43:58.5]


COUNSELOR: Sounds like it's, in a way it's a very simple process. This is what they have to give and they can give it. They don't have to get quote, trained. They don't have - 


PATIENT: They do get trained. Just that's it. They do. 


COUNSELOR: But they don't have to get trained the same the way that you're having to get trained. 


PATIENT: The point of the training is like it's very completely related to what they're going to do. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. 


PATIENT: And it's not training for training's sake. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: Which I don't call training. 


COUNSELOR: Yeah. 


PATIENT: And there's something sordid in coughing up facts or something like that. 


COUNSELOR: There's something very appealing about being able to do that. 


PATIENT: Mm-hmm. There really is. I mean like, I know, I just, I've thought practically every time that I decided to kill myself, you know gee maybe there's something that you could be doing that's worthwhile. But in that sense would be a bad thing if you kill yourself. And the thought that there was something would usually keep me going. 


And you know kind of that even if it was some little, insignificant thing, even if I had to be a nun in some kind of a little convent, where I was doing something for a few people, I would be making more of a contribution then than I would if I were dead. And you know then I would sort of thinking about it, sort of get inspired to see if I could find such a thing. Or something similar. But like I have no desire. I've got at least nine or ten incompletes or something or like that. That I have no desire whatsoever to make up. Because who cares? [0:46:09.1]


COUNSELOR: It sounds like there's something very defeating about your current situation. And you read it quite clearly in the sense that that's okay you've got all these things to do, but essentially you're unmotivated. 


PATIENT: Mm-hmm. 


COUNSELOR: Or like you know - 


PATIENT: There's, I can do things really well. And put a hell of a lot of effort in them and do them much better than is required, actually. I usually do. But I'll either do that or I won't do a damn thing. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm


PATIENT: And if there's no reason for doing something. I mean if nobody's going to care if you do it, and if it's not leading to anything, I mean I can do a certain amount of shit work if it's going to lead to something worthwhile. That's no problem. I can make up every one of these incompletes and read every one of those books that I'm supposed to read. Some of which I would really would like to read. If somehow it's going to help me to be a better psychologist.


In the way that I want to be one. If it's going to give me a PhD that means that I know something rather than that I put in a certain amount of shit work. But you know as it stands right now I just got this whole list of things to do and I refuse to start on it. Because somehow even reading the newspaper or talking to a roommate or something like that is more important. Than something that just adds to a list of things that you've done that doesn't mean anything. 


COUNSELOR: It sounds like you really feel in some way that it's very important, I don't know where I'm getting this from, it's very important not to do, not to assent, not to acquiesce, not to act like you were motivated when in fact you're not. Like that in some way is a very true expression of part of yourself. To have these incompletes and to leave them incomplete. [0:48:15.9]


PATIENT: It's not so much a really wanting to do it as it really, I can't do it. I mean there's so much in me that's rebelling against it. That waking up with the thought of today I'm going to finish this incomplete that I consider meaningless, makes me go back to sleep. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: Or makes me, puts me in such a bad mood that I literally can't concentrate on whatever book I'm reading. I mean I will read it and reread it and nothing will go in. And I will end up just hating myself and getting into really such a horrible state that I literally can't work. I mean it'll be just such a complete depression and such a complete blocking out of the world because I'm doing something that I don't consider worthwhile. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: And that really, I mean it really prevents me from reading. Or certainly from absorbing and doing anything creative with what I've read. 


COUNSELOR: Sounds like you're almost, like I not only can't, but you suspect like it's partly I just won't participate in this. I won't participate in anything that's part of this system or something. I mean it sounds like it feels like you can't. And that you just, oh, turn over and go back to sleep. But it's sounding like partly I guess maybe the word rebel made me feel like, well it isn't just a question of not being able to, but there's some sense in which, I won't. 


PATIENT: It's kind of a combination. 


COUNSELOR: Is that conscious? The I won't?


PATIENT: It's -  the I won't is somewhat conscious except that even if I say I will for some other reason, like it would be really nice to tell my father who keeps asking me, "Have you made up all your incompletes?" That I have. [0:50:08.1]


And I would really feel better if I didn't have them hanging over me. I would feel a lot freer to do other things. And I wouldn't feel like I had to stay trapped in my room. And so I mean it's really doing a lot of negative things for me. 


COUNSELOR: Yeah.


PATIENT: To me. But at the same time, somehow to say that I will for no reason, isn't enough. I mean to sit down at the desk, I could go through a ten hour day of sitting at that desk trying, and just putting myself through absolute misery, whereas to just get it done would be a lot simpler. But somehow like there's something in me that won't let me get it done. I mean, for the most part, it's not that difficult. It's just, but it requires a certain amount of motivation. That I just don't have. Because there's so much in me that's speaking against it. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.


PATIENT: But I literally, I mean I really can't. It's not it may be an unconscious kind of I won't that's making the I can't. 


COUNSELOR: Right. 


PATIENT: But it comes out as an I can't. Because I really wish I could. I'd love to get rid of those things.


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. 


PATIENT: And I mean that's really been really true all through college for the most part. Every term paper I wrote was a like masterpiece in the sense but it was only because I ended writing on something I really cared about. I ended up doing ten times more research than I needed to do and making it five times longer than it needed to be. But longer not just in you know like really in content. I ended up writing my prelims from all of my own old term papers because they were all the sum of my knowledge practically. [0:52:03.9]


And you know I would stay up all night for weeks and you know in a sense put myself through what anyone else would consider hell. But it was, it was fantastic, because I really cared about what I was doing. And I could do it again, I know. If there was a reason. And I don't know how to find that reason. 


COUNSELOR: You're feeling like you're going to have to trick yourself almost into doing it? Is that it?


PATIENT: I'm going to have to trick myself into doing it or I'm going to have to quit. I mean keep going closer and closer to the quitting. 


COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Like something's going to force the issue. You just can't, you can't stay hanging like this. It feels like.


PATIENT: Well I can go on doing another clerkship or something like that. But that's about it. I don't even think I could get an internship at this point. 


COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.


PATIENT: Given my academic record. And yet there's so much in me that's fighting against doing it. And it's just it's really -  reaches a point of like okay one thing I really want to and have to do is go off and start finding some good internships. At the same time, before you do this you've got to finish the incompletes. And I end up not doing a damn thing except worrying about all the things that I'm not doing. 


COUNSELOR: It's time to stop. [0:53:40.2] (end of audio)
