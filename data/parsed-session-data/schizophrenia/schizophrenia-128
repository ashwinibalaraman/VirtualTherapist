<b>I</b> came back out to the parking lot. Stan had driven the car over
to the gas pumps and was studying a map he had laid out on the
car hood.


"How much farther?" I asked.


"Where's my fried pie?" he asked at the same time.


"I forgot. Sorry."


"I need a sugar stimulus. I'm fading," he said, then left for the
McDonald's. "Don't go anywhere without me."


"No, we don't have time. He called."


That stopped him in his tracks.


"Where. When."


They weren't even questions.


"Well, I <i>think</i> he called. Jess said somebody called. Back in New

[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was shaking as I got behind the wheel.


A call in the middle of the night.


I couldn't take another one.


I couldn't go in that room again.


Isn't that what Tim had said once, "I can't go in that room again"?


No, he had said, "I <i>won't</i> go in that room."


But there was no place else left to go, as the car headed in one
direction, and I went somewhere else entirely.


Oh, yes, we've had this date from the beginning.


The thing I had dreaded for so long but never truly thought possible,
began, like so many things in our history, with a phone call. It
was Tim, just a few weeks ago, about five on a Saturday morning,
saying he had just tried to kill himself by slashing his wrist. He was
drunk and crying and there was blood everywhere and he didn't
know where he was.


I ricocheted out of sleep, from dreams to def con in milliseconds,
scrambling for words. I tried to stay calm, but the shakes and panic
he must have felt carried through miles of buried phone cable to me.
I squeezed the phone as hard as I could to keep from dropping it and
tried to remember what to do when you're on fire:


Stop.


Drop.


Roll.


I did them:

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00187&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My heart stopped.


I dropped through the sky.


I rolled through time, wondering if this is how, after everything
else, it would all end.


"WHERE ARE YOU? D'YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?
STAY THERE. I'LL COME GET YOU."


I was screaming at a deaf man.


"Don't know...don't know where...come you...come
house."


"NO! WHERE ARE YOU? STAY THERE. What's your phone
number? LOOK AT THE PHONE. Give me the number...give it
to me before time runs out."


The phone slipped from his hands, his bleeding hands, as I heard,
"Don't get you, gonna die."


A scrambling sound, trying to find the hook for the phone, plastic
banging at metal....


"TIM...TIM...WAIT...YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT...."


Then the dial tone, same as a fiat line.


I had just lost the only link to my twin brother, who was drunk
and lost and bleeding to death.


I had started not to answer that phone.


That Saturday morning, I heard the jangle, squeezed my comfortable
soft pillow tighter and whispered to Jess, "Don't get it." I knew it
was Tim and I knew I didn't want to, or couldn't, save him anymore.


He needed money.


He needed a place to stay, another boyfriend having kicked him out.


He needed a job; did I know of anything?


He needed to stop drinking.


He needed a friend.


And I didn't need any of those things.

[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00188&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But sometimes there is God, so quickly.


A second before the answering machine picked up, I rolled over
and grabbed the phone.


Seven years of knowing, and waiting, were finally over, but all I
could do was wait some more, and remember the litany of good and
bad that had happened since Tim had moved to New York two years
ago, on the rebound from Louisville.


The bad: drunken phone calls late at night, berating me for some
failing, some comfort I had that he didn't, that I had gone to Yale for
grad school but he should have, because he was smarter than I was.
Calls that would end with him slamming down the phone, just after
he'd scream that his miserable life was all my fault.


The good: seeing Saturday matinees of plays together, Tim crying
and saying they made him want to be a better person. His saying that
made me want to be a better person, made me want to open my
heart to the brother whose calls I used to welcome. One Christmas,
we made stockings out of felt and glitter and hung them on my
mantle in Brooklyn. They were the first stockings we'd had since we
were kids.


Two years of life in the Big Apple, and a few plays and Christmas
stockings were the only good things I could remember.


All that, flashing through my head, like the life review I'd have at
Judgment Day.


I didn't think I' pass.


Finally, Tim arrived at my apartment—minutes, hours, years
later?—and stumbled out of a cab, as if pushed. (He <i>was</i> pushed,
because he didn't have the money to pay.) Through the bay window
in my living room, my eyes met his for a second before I ran to the
front hallway to let him in.


His face was puffy and red, his hair abnormally short, as if he'd

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00189&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I pulled open the gate; metal scraped across the concrete floor.
The dogs whined and pawed against Tim's blood-soaked legs. Still
not saying anything, he held out his left arm to me, like Frankenstein
slowly raising it to his master for the first time: "See what you have
created." His fingers were smeared with blood; his skin was stuck to
the sleeve of the shirt, but I could see where he had hacked into it:
a V of skin, hanging loose, two slashes ending in a sharp point. I saw
skin and blood and bone and muscle and snapped shut my eyes, just
as I had done in the fourth grade, when I looked at my own broken
arm and saw bone pierce skin.


Bone-pierce-skin; noun-verb-noun, it was that elemental, that
primal, that unadorned, that horrible.


I said a quick prayer—Blessed Virgin Mary, save us miserable sinners,
now, and at the hour of our deaths—and opened my eyes to
find Tim staring at me with a dare. This was our contest: who could
withstand the most pain. And he had won, hands down, hands cut
off. He had gone to the mat, the bell had rung, the referee had held
up his bleeding arm for victory, skin flapping in the breeze.


He had hurt the most and won.


He could burst into tears, now that he had been declared the champ.


Standing there, crying, he rocked back and forth on his heels,
looking down at his shoes. "I just shined my shoes, I just shined my
shoes," he kept intoning. He was wearing shiny black loafers, so
shiny I could see my face in them, and I could imagine how nice his
outfit must have looked at the beginning of the evening: the shirt
clean and pressed, its sleeves rolled up and cuffed a perfect three

[p. <i>183</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00190&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I moved him into the living room and sat him down on the
couch, as he switched to saying, "I would have died if you hadn't
been here."


I had been seconds—less—away from not answering that phone.


But sometimes there is God, so quickly.


I tried to distract him from his pain, and mine, while I figured out
what to do; we had to get his arm sewn up. Most of the blood was
dried up but a little was still seeping; if the loss of blood didn't kill
him, I thought, massive infection would. To vamp for time, I was
grabbing at straws, saying anything. "Look at the new rocker Jess just
bought. We got it from an antique store in the neighborhood. Jess
recovered the seat. See how much Opie and Franny love you?"
Franny was trying to sneak her head onto Tim's knee, her favorite
spot with visitors. I started asking—Tim, Jess, God, anybody who
would answer—if we should take him to the hospital. Jess had been
quiet, brought Tim water, but now started asking, too. Tim went
back to rocking back and forth and saying he had just shined his
shoes; he didn't want to go to the hospital.


It is no time/to make your brothers cry, shined shoes or not.


Jess went into the bedroom to find something for a bandage, and
I followed, trying to be quiet so Tim wouldn't hear. It would have
been funny if it weren't so damn serious, a movie scene where
someone slaps a hysterical person to shut them up. Jess didn't slap
me, but he should have; I clutched my stomach and wailed, "He's
going to die," soft at first, then uncontrollably loud. I didn't care who
heard me; I couldn't keep it in anymore.

[p. <i>184</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00191&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He was going to die.


He was going to die.


Where had I heard that before?


Jess hissed that he <i>was</i> going to die if we didn't get him to a hospital;
there wasn't any "Does he want to go?" about it. The cut was deep,
and it was still bleeding. It had to be sewn up. Jess gathered a clean
white tube sock with a red band around the top and some tape to
patch it up temporarily. We went back to the living room, to hell with
whatever Tim had heard. Jess, whose life had been so carefree and
steady and uninterrupted before he met me, wrapped the wound.


Without warning, without even knowing I was going to do it, I
grabbed Tim and whispered that everything was going to be okay,
then guided him off the couch and out of the apartment, even as he
held back and said he didn't want to go. Jess took his other side and
we kept walking; there was no turning back. We moved outdoors
like the characters in the final scene of <i>The Birds</i>: our avengers were
gathering, ready to attack, but all we could do was leave. We couldn't
stay in that house anymore. We gathered the dawn around us like a
battle hymn, an anthem to survival, as Tim had once written, and
began walking to the hospital, seven or eight blocks away.


We supported Tim on either side; he wasn't just cut and bleeding,
but drunk. We hadn't changed his blood-soaked shirt—that would
have meant unpeeling it from the wound—so the few people who
were out so early stared at us. We walked in silence, nobody daring
to ask what had happened, or where or when. I was looking for the
mundane, the practical, like "a few hours ago, at my apartment";
Tim, the poet, the philosopher, the truth-teller, would have
answered, "Twenty-one years ago, the day Our Mother died...seven
years ago, at Mo Ranch, when I couldn't decide who to love...but
neither wound has ever stopped bleeding."

[p. <i>185</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00192&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Street lamps flashed by on either side of the highway, as Stan said
something to me again. He had been saying it for a while; I just
hadn't heard. "You sent him the same thing?"


"What?"


Stan had been reading more of the letters, and I had been remembering
my brother with his hand cut off, and the family that had
handed him the knife.


"This letter...it says you sent each other the same book for your
birthday."


"Wait." I shook my head, to try and clear it. "What are you talking
about?"


"I don't know where you've been, but I've been reading these letters.
His letters. The one about the birthday, where you both sent
each other the same book."


"Oh. Yeah. We did that a lot...the same thing...same book. We
even had the same nervous breakdown."


"Huh?" Stan asked. "Now I'm confused. Which one of you had
the nervous breakdown?"


"We both did," I said, focusing carefully on each word, so I
wouldn't have to focus on drunkenness, or a long walk to a hospital,
holding up my drunken brother, or a wrist that was cut and wouldn't
stop bleeding.


"Read something, make noise," I practically begged Stan. "Make
it go away."


"Make what go away?"


"The pictures in my head. Make the pictures go away."


So he read.

<i>To little Peatie on his Birthday:</i>


<i>I bet the old woman who made our jelly-bean cakes is dead now, but if I
could bring her back, just this once, I would, and you could eat jelly-bean
cake with all your little friends. Would Little Peatie like that?</i>


<i>Enclosed is your birthday present:</i> The Habit of Being <i>has been one of
my constant companions for the last month or so, and I believe you'll enjoy
Flannery O'Connor's letters. In a very strong way, they remind me of the
letters from Mother to Porky we used to sneak into his room to read. Porky
told me something very interesting during my visit to him in D. C. this 4th
of July. We were sitting in his kitchen on a Saturday afternoon, drinking
something called Lilet (it had won prizes, like A-1 Sauce). I was telling him
about</i> The Habit of Being <i>(what a brilliant title) when he asked me if he
had ever told me about Indira Gandhi. Of all the things we had talked
about, that was not one of them. In a very quiet, humble voice—something
rare from Porky—he said she was just like Mother. He talked of his surprise
at flying halfway around the world to find a woman who looked, acted, and
treated him like Mother would have. (Mother and the three gay Powers
boys. What was in that water we drank as children? I think we should offer
ourselves up—for a sizeable cash advance, of course—to any scientists who
would care to study us.)</i>


<i>Just as I was getting ready to mail this yesterday—obviously, I haven't
made it to the post office yet—I got your birthday present to me, a copy of</i>
The Habit of Being. <i>Somehow, I'm not at all surprised we sent each other
the same thing; are we the same person, I often wonder? That would not be
such a bad thing. I love you more than life itself, you are my very habit of
being</i>.


<i>My heart goes out to you, during your rough summer in the sticks,
bringing art to the masses—even if it is in the form of</i> The Man Who

[p. <i>187</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00194&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>I face the day with a bourbon on the rocks in a chic little downtown bar,
before my lowly collection job at the bank. I've only had one drink, not a
third of the way through, and my lips are tingling</i>.


<i>Word is out now that First National Bank, where I work, now that my
VISTA tenure is over, discriminates against queers. (Me, working in a bank:
the irony. Me, the new gay activist: the irony.) Do you remember my telling
you about Sam Dorr, who was fired by the bank when they found out he
was gay? I have been in a rage for two days over it. When Sarah was raped
in college, I wrote a pointed letter to John D. Mosely, our esteemed college
president, full of sound and fury. He passed it on to Howard F (didn't that
stand for Fuckface?) Starr, the dean of students. There are times when you
speak and wait and look and watch for some spark of recognition to strike
in the other's face</i>.


<i>RAGE, RAGE AGAINST THE ABSENCE OF THE LIGHT</i>.


<i>Lord, give us the ability to rage correctly</i>.


—<i>Litany that rage will not drive men to madness</i>—



[p. <i>188</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Oh, well, oh, hell, I still don't think I've learned to live in the real world.
I promise I won't turn into a martyr about this. One more thing—I feel like
a raging drunk in a bar late at night, just before closing time, except this bar
has just opened—it was my fantasy in high school, seriously, to save my
friends—women, mostly—from ever marrying the wrong people. I wanted to
save Sarah in college; I couldn't. I was going to save Ellen in high school; I
didn't, and look what happened. I never told you that Ellen sent me a letter
a week before she married saying she needed to talk to me very much. We
never talked. She got married</i>.


<i>Draw your own conclusions</i>.


<i>Does all of this make you want to cry? Are you crying now? I've had too
much coffee—and just the right amount of booze—to cry now. It will have
to be a different season before I cry again, but I will cry</i>.


<i>I promise you that</i>.


<i>Timmy</i>


He kept his promise.


He did cry again.


Happy fucking birthday.


"What's a breakdown like?" Stan begged. "I think I had one, too."
"You'll know when it happens."
I knew, because that's what happened to me, the summer I spent

[p. <i>189</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00196&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That's how bad it was.


I tried to go swimming in a nearby pond to get over the stress but
couldn't, because I was afraid of the water.


<i>That's</i> what a nervous breakdown is like, in case you want to compare
and contrast.


Stan was staring at me.


Had I said any of that aloud?


I don't know.


That's what a nervous breakdown is like, not knowing whether
the white noise in your head is coming out, not being able to stop
all the white noise of memory, not being able to forget Tim begging
for help in a hospital.


The pictures were coming back, and I couldn't stop them.


"Was he working heavy machinery?"


Blood was seeping through Tim's makeshift bandage, but all the
lady at the hospital's front desk cared about was his insurance and
work address.


She was looking down at her silly forms.


I kept saying, "He cut himself."


She kept thinking I meant accidentally.

[p. <i>190</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00197&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"He cut himself, he cut himself," I kept saying, not able to say the
truth myself, "He cut himself <i>deliberately</i>; he tried to <i>kill</i> himself." I
could only give the polite version; even Tim, mad at me for
answering for him, would only say, "I cut myself."


"He <i>cut himself</i>."


Finally, the light dawned in her eyes. It was the first time she
looked up from her paperwork. "You shouldn't have done that," she
said and seemed to slow down even more. I begged, then yelled at
her, to call a doctor. When she wouldn't, I grabbed Tim as my
human shield and pushed him through swinging doors into the real
emergency area.


We came upon a clump of doctors, young and tired-looking, but
at least they weren't hiding behind the protocol of forms to fill out.
"How did he do this? Was he drinking?" One whiff and they knew.
One doctor took over and unwrapped our sock bandage. "That's
pretty nasty," he said, in front of Tim. "Whatcha use on yourself?"


"A bottle," Tim said.


"You drink it first? That's pretty dumb." He was the first person
that morning to express any anger to Tim's face. This tired, busy
doctor was too tired and busy for the special handling of twins.


Good.


We could have used him—both of us—years ago.


He told me to wait outside while he took stitches, just like when
we were children and Tim's head was gaping open. This time, there
was no nearby phone booth to hide in.


By the time they let me back in, I'd expected that Tim would have
been changed into a hospital gown, but he was still wearing the black
jeans and yellow shirt. His right arm was still caked with blood, but
the cut forearm, his left—<i>sinister</i> in Latin, that's the one other thing
I remember from four years of studying a dead language, besides

[p. <i>191</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00198&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tim must have been given pain shots, but he still winced as the
doctor sewed his hand back on with heavy black thread. Tim was
Humpty Dumpty all over again, just as he had been, had wanted to
be, in college, now literally being sewn back together.


When he had finished, the doctor brought me out of the room to
tell me he wanted to keep Tim overnight for observation. They
would try to get him into the psychiatric ward of the hospital rather
than the closest facility, which he told me was a real snakepit. That's
when it hit me: this was bigger than the Powers twins doing whatever
they wanted to, damn the consequences. We had—fuck it, <i>Tim</i>
had—crossed a line, and "authorities" had taken over. As much as I
wanted someone else to take over, I was scared. Could they do what
they wanted, or did Tim or I have any say?


No, we didn't.


The doctor left, and I went in to see Tim again, sitting in a side
room on a gurney. He reached out to hug me, crying and saying,
"Please don't leave me," and I pulled away. I pulled away like I did
that night in college, when he wanted to "hold hands like European
men" and dance across a dew-covered lawn in the early morning,
and I wanted to have things my way.


Then, he hadn't felt me pull away.


Now, he did, because I wanted him to.


I wanted to make him mad for all those times he had made me mad.


It worked: he lashed out at me, as he had done so many times
before. "Okay, be that way. Fine. Just get out of here. Leave me alone."


But I refused; I wanted another pound of flesh. "Make me. Just try.
You're too weak to fight. Just try to get me out of here."

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00199&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I swear to God I said that.


(I light a match to my skin now, to feel the flames of hell I know
are waiting for me.)


He tried to hit me with his good hand, but he lost his balance and
tipped over on the gurney because he couldn't put weight on the
bad arm, bandaged up to the fingers in white gauze.


I laughed at him; I dared him to try again to hit me.


(I move the match to the delicate skin under my left bicep and
think this is what hell will feel like. The pain is unimaginable.)


Tim started crying. "What have I done? My life is ruined. My life
is a disaster. I could have died."


I told him I <i>might</i> come back to visit him that afternoon and left.


(I move the match to the hair under my arms and smell the curly
singe.)


Outside the hospital, the promise that had been in the air that
morning had turned into reality. It was a bright, beautiful day. The
flea market was in full swing, people were in jogging suits, couples
were picking up orange juice and bagels. I crumpled over into the
chain link of a parking lot fence; Jess pulled me up and supported
me all the way home, the way we had supported Tim.


"Pull over, pull over, grab the wheel...."


I thought I was having a heart attack, or a brain attack. I felt like
I was going to die if I had to remember one more horrible thing I
had done.


Stan reached over me to grab the steering wheel and swerve us to
the side of the road. I managed to cut the engine; a crunch of gravel,
a sudden stop, and we both banged into the dashboard.

[p. <i>193</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00200&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What's wrong? You okay? What happened?"


You don't wanna know.


You don't wanna ever find anybody cut up and dying.


You don't wanna ever deny your brother.


That's what's wrong.


I got out of the car and sat on the still-warm hood of the car. It
was cool and dark outside, about five in the morning, and the
warmth of the engine was the best thing I'd felt in days.


Tim and I used to sit on the hood of our car back home and talk
about the future. They were the best, and scariest, times we'd ever had.


"Are you cracking up on me?" Stan ventured.


"You tell me. I'm too tired to think anymore."


I thought about my brother and curled into a fetal position on the
warm car hood, under the limitless Texas sky that was just turning
into morning.


I could die right then and there, and it would feel wonderful, and
I would never have to think about my brother in a hospital ever
again, waiting for me with his hand hanging on by a heavy black
thread.


But even on the warm hood of that car, it's all I could think about.


Back at our apartment, I took a shower and put on clean clothes, to get
the hospital off me. Jess plunged into sketching; I languished on the bed
in my robe, my skin still damp, not certain what to do or who to call.


Of course, I called Porky, as I did whenever disaster struck. A Saturday
morning, calling him early at home, and I was afraid of disturbing
him by telling him our brother was in the nuthouse with his
arm hanging by a literal thread.

[p. <i>194</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Something bad happened. Everything's okay now, but Tim tried
to kill himself this morning."


He said a quick, "Oh my God."


"He's in the hospital now and has to stay overnight."


I flashed back to the first conversation like this I had ever had with
Porky, seven years earlier, when Tim had his breakdown, and I made
a collect call to Big Brother, in my bare feet, from my dorm. The triangle
was still the same: Tim, the one in trouble; me, the bearer of
bad news, but almost apologetic about it; and Porky, the one who
could fix any situation, mend any problem, with the same practical
questions as always: was Tim's insurance paid up? Was there a convenient
shuttle to take?


He told me to call him after I had seen Tim that afternoon, that
he would come to New York the next day if I needed him to.


I didn't tell him I might not see Tim, because I already knew I
would. I had known I would the second I told Tim I might not.


That afternoon, I put together a change of clothes and some magazines
for Tim; packing them reminded me of Anne Frank, taking
her few belongings with her in a little sack. The worst had happened;
at least now we could live in hope.


Tim had been placed in the last available bed in the geriatric
wing of the psych ward. For all the elaborate sign-in procedures
downstairs—you had to carry a big wooden visitation pass, visible at
all times—chaos reigned upstairs on the ward. Patients walked
around at liberty, some wearing hospital shifts, others wearing regular
clothes. It was difficult to tell the patients from their visitors,
who seemed just as worn out and drawn from their visits as the
patients did their incarceration. That's where those big wooden passes
came in handy. Us versus them, they said; here but for the grace of
God, they also said. A man shuffled up to me in broken-down house

You have seen broken men, I am sure.


It was the phrase Tim had written in the letter to his friend Roy,
describing the day and night of his breakdown in college, a phrase
that conjured up the absolute depths to which Tim had fallen, from
which seemingly nothing could lift him. And it was a perfect
description of this place he was in now, a psych ward full of broken
men, and the equally broken people who came to visit them.


Us, and them.


Tim had finally taken off his bloodstained clothes, wadded them
up on a Naugahyde chair in his single room, and put on a hospital
gown. His pale, spindly legs poked out from underneath the hem;
how desperately I wanted him to have a summer tan on those legs,
as if that would have prevented all this.


We stared at each other, then tears filled his eyes as he told me
he had just prayed as hard as he could, a very real prayer, for me
to come.


He looked at me with those pained eyes, no dare in them now,
and asked, "Will you forgive me?"


Before I could say anything, he began talking.


"I've never told you this, but back in college, right before my
breakdown, I had a dream. I had the same dream again just the other
night. Maybe that's why this happened."


I still said nothing, so he began telling the story like a monologue
from a play, as if he had already rehearsed it time and again. Maybe
he had, so it would never leave him.


I know it hasn't left me, and never will.


"I said it was a dream, but I don't know. I think it was real."


He took a deep breath and started.

[p. <i>196</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00203&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"We were back at home, and we were...it's like we were grown
up and little at the same time, like we kept switching back and forth.
It was after dinner and the streetlights were on. I was playing in the
front yard and I looked up to see Mother walking down the street
toward me, carrying a suitcase, that old blue cardboard thing we used
to have. I said, ‘I thought you died.’ She smiled, like it was a joke or
something, and said she couldn't stay. I was so mad at her for dying,
just when I needed her, that I yelled at her.


"‘Get out of here. Now!’


"But she didn't.


"It's like she looked right through me and said, ‘Will you forgive
me?’


"I wanted so bad to say no, but I couldn't.


"She said it again. ‘Will you forgive me?’ and this time...it's like
...something inside broke or something, and I said, ‘Yes.’ And she
held me and she was so warm, it's like I'd never felt anything that
warm, and we were playing in the front yard and having so much
fun I forgot what time it was and she said, ‘I have to go now.’


"And I knew I couldn't go with her.


"She kissed me and told me she'd always be with me. Then she said
good-bye and walked down the street. I watched her, harder than I've
ever watched anything in my life, but, I don't know...a bird flew or
a dog barked or something, and I looked away, just for a second. Just
for a second...and she was gone. Maybe that's why I had a breakdown.


"Maybe that's why I cut my hand off.


"Because I didn't see her leave.


"I looked away.


"So...will you forgive me?"


He asked me again, the same question our mother had asked him
in the dream.

[p. <i>197</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00204&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I didn't answer, not exactly, but pulled from an even deeper place
than the heart—oh, biology doesn't begin to teach us of these other
places, other rooms, where the real business of life goes on—and
asked, "Will <i>you</i> forgive <i>me</i>?"


Us versus them.


Broken men.


We held each other and cried.


He tried to tell me what had happened, how he cut his wrist, but
he couldn't remember. All he knew is that he felt as if he had been
asleep and filled with rage ever since our senior year in college, when
he went home; so filled with sound and fury he thought he could
literally uproot lightpoles from the ground. He would stare at them,
close his eyes so tight he shook, and try to levitate them into the air.
When that didn't happen, he turned the fury on himself; he could at
least uproot his hand from his body, make it fly around and do his
bidding. He dug into his arm the same way he would dig into the
ground with a garden spade; he wanted to get to the root of the anger,
which had spread and wouldn't let him go. And when he found that
the "ground" of his skin was too hard, he started hacking into it,
hard, sharp, with no concern about what the final result would look
like, just that he had been able to break through.


And that's why I saw skin and bone and muscle and cartilage and
veins and blood when he showed up at my apartment.


Now the anger had been leeched, at least for a little while, and there
was nothing to do but try to live, and even laugh, until it returned. And
make no mistake about it. It could, and would, return. So we laughed:
about the "Nurse Ratched" who tried to get Tim to join "therapy";
about hatching a plot to break Tim out; about his joke in college that
he was going to end up locked away in a nuthouse with a bunch of
crazy old women who thought they were the Bronte sisters.

[p. <i>198</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00205&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It wasn't a joke anymore, it had come to pass, but we still
laughed at it.


We were the twins, sitting on Porky's bed once again, wondering
what life would be like. The twins: one with his arm nearly slashed
off, the other bearing gifts of toothbrush and magazines and clean
clothes.


The blood was gone, for now.


I stayed at the hospital through the afternoon and into the
evening, through the meal with plastic utensils and no sharp edges
that was brought into Tim, until the announcement came that visiting
hours were over. I left with the prayer that I had given him
enough strength to face the night, to not be afraid of its newness, its
darkness.


I left with the prayer that I would be given that same strength.


Outside, it was a perfect Indian summer evening, warm and cool
at the same time. Now, I thought, I am a man, I have survived this
day, and I would probably survive many more to come. As Tim had
once written, I couldn't imagine anything more terrifying.


Back home from the hospital that night, I called Porky, already
afraid of losing that special connection I had felt with Tim, of Big
Brother taking over. But he seemed to sense that and knew to be
gentle. "Don't worry, little brother. Everything will be okay now."


How I loved it when he called me little brother; it brought back
the times when I truly was a little brother, rolling around, reading his
letters on his bed with Tim, wishing and dreaming, crying and whispering,
listening to ghosts. And safe. Always safe, like the lock was on
the inside of the room as well as the outside.


But when Porky arrived the next day, he was in his no-nonsense
business mode, honed through years of cutting through red tape and
bullshit in Washington. Instead of good memories of New Year's Eve

[p. <i>199</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00206&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He wanted to make us grow up by looking into the flames; oh, I
was grown up now, I wanted to tell him. How many flames had I
looked into since then?


"Well, what happened?" he asked, point-blank, as much what did
<i>you</i> do as what did <i>Tim</i> do.


How should I answer? Should I go back to that night in college
when I wasn't there to save Tim, when he threw an alarm clock
across the street, its breaking glass the only sound he heard as he
cried and screamed? Should I go back to the funeral of our mother,
which Porky wouldn't let us attend? Go back to him holding us over
a trash can alive with flames, watching our childhoods melt?


Should I go back to the time Porky himself had spent at home, a
sick young man who might not live, when I heard our mother cry
out, "He's going to die. He can't make it. <i>I</i> can't make it." Should I
tell Porky that I—and maybe even Tim—had heard that, and carried
that time bomb with us for years, that our whole family could go at
any minute?


Should I tell him how Tim and I had both witnessed our sainted
mother beat our drunken father with a frying pan, saying with
clenched teeth that "the Great Apostle Paul told me to do this" and
knowing she was insane, and that the same fate might befall us as well?


No, I didn't tell Porky any of those things; he wouldn't understand.


To his question "Well, what happened?" I told him, "I don't know."

[p. <i>200</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00207&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As we walked to the hospital, we passed a junky souvenir shop
that had T-shirts in the window; Porky's eye was caught by one that
said, "Because I'm the Daddy, that's why." He was the "daddy" in his
relationship with Steve and said for me to remind him to buy it on
our way back from the hospital. We were about to visit our brother
who had just tried to cut off his hand, and Porky was thinking about
cute T-shirts. But I went along, agreeing how funny the T-shirt was,
how much Steve would love it, because I wanted Porky to love me.
The walk was exactly like the one Jess and I had taken with Tim the
previous morning to the hospital, talking, or not talking, about
everything but the thing at hand:


<i>Tim's</i> hand.


With his assured, steady politician's voice, Porky got our clunky
wooden guest passes, the ones that said we were "normal." On the
elevator ride up to the ward, Porky said he would have a one-on-one
with Tim, while I dealt with getting him released. But from the
minute Porky and I walked into Tim's room together, just as I had
known when Porky walked into my apartment, I knew there would
be no more honesty, no more laughing and crying, but sullenness,
defensiveness, silence, and fear: Porky bullying, Tim the same in
return. Porky stayed behind as I signed a form accepting responsibility
for Tim, formalizing what I had been doing most of my life.
It was amazingly easy and only took a few seconds. As eager as they
had been to get Tim into the place, now they wanted him out.


Must have had another patient on the way.


The heartfelt one-on-one between Porky and Tim did not take
long; I don't know what was said, except that Porky was all business
when I came back, ten or so minutes later, telling me to wait outside
while Tim changed his clothes.


Not a lot was said as we took that now familiar path back home.

[p. <i>201</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00208&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I couldn't forget anything, that was my problem.


Neither could Tim.


Porky was a boy no longer; he was a "Daddy," as the T-shirt he
bought testified. He was already rushing to get home; if he did this
and that, he could make the next shuttle back to Washington. It was
like when our mother died; we made plans—or plans were made for
us—but we didn't talk about what had happened.


Porky made sure I would take Tim back to his apartment, too
afraid to face the truth, whatever physical evidence Tim had left
behind: a shard of glass, the lost ring of keys, the blood. He left, in
and out in all of three hours.


Although I offered for Tim to spend the night at our place, he
grimly wanted to get back to his sublet, to try and solve the mystery
of what had happened, because he had no memory of it. We took
the subway together to his sublet on the Upper West Side, only for
him to realize he no longer had his keys—they had been lost some-where
along the way.


He had to buzz a stranger to get into his very own building.


When we got to his apartment, the door was unlocked, but not
broken into; his keys weren't in the lock. There was no blood inside,
no broken glass, just the usual mess of his life, his green trash bags,

[p. <i>202</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00209&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Where, and how, he had cut his wrist would remain a mystery.


I felt arms around me.


"Are you cold, tiny baby?"


They were the words Tim used to say to me, at our best, most
tender times together.


I imagined he was whispering them to me now.


I opened my eyes; I was still curled up on the hood of the car, and
Stan was wrapping me in a blanket from the trunk.


"We're almost there."


"Where?" I asked, shaking myself out of my reverie, knowing that
that was the right question to ask, but having no clue as to where we
were. I had been lost to everything but looking for blood, and a
sharp knife or jagged piece of glass, for the last leg of the journey.


"There. Mo Ranch. I didn't realize we were so close. The fog
cleared, and I saw it. See?" He pointed off in the distance. "Like
Brigadoon.We did that in high school. I ran the light board."


It was just like Tim had described it, once upon a time—the gates
of Mo Ranch, a wooden cross up on the hill in one direction, and a
shimmering river in the other.


Stan magically whipped a bottle of orange baby aspirin from his
pocket and spoonfed me a few of the chalky tablets. "I've been
thinking. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. Not every one I have is.
Maybe we should go back."


"But we're already here. I wanna see the sunrise. Tim used to say he'd
get up early in the morning there, just to see it come up over the river."

[p. <i>203</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00210&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Yeah, but you...are you feeling okay? You seem kinda...sick.
Upset."


"Let's just keep going. A few more miles isn't gonna make a difference.
We've gotta find out if he's here or not. We can't stop now."


"I guess, yeah, but no more letters. I think they're kinda depressing
you. Just funny stories the rest of the way. Or ‘Ninety-nine Bottles
of Beer on the Wall.’"


He got me off the hood of the car and put me in the passenger's
seat. "I'll drive the rest of the way. You just look, or sleep. Don't read.
I'm taking the letters away."


That's what he thought.


They may have been in the back seat, but I didn't need them in
hand to remember what they said.


Didn't he know that by now?


He said it one last time before he turned the engine back on.
"See, I told you it was beautiful."


And it was.


A hint of orangy violet in the sky, a tease of rising sun: the beautiful
place where my brother fell apart.
