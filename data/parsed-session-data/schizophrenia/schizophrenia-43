In this chapter I bring together the stories of a number of
persons who were so little disturbed mentally that it is
questionable if they ever needed to be locked up. I imagine
they could have been taken care of, at least for most of the
time, in the home of some kindly and sensible person--
perhaps a retired nurse. Some could have been cared for in
the new type of mental hospital in which the person stays
only at night. By day he may go back to his job.


Some persons, when mildly manic, seem sane enough; all
they need is to be kept from rambling about, wasting the
family's funds, perhaps getting drunk, or getting into conflicts
with the police and others. Some get to calling up
their friends at 2 A.M., or they start throwing big expensive
parties that they cannot afford. Many persons, like Jim
Curran, need mainly board and lodging during the years
in which their mind is so dulled they cannot work and earn
a living. Miss Margaret Wilson could probably have been
cared for in a home, if there had only been one open to her.
William Moore seemed to have little need for confinement
in a hospital. Henry C. Brown was a bit depressed, but he
doubted if his thinking was ever much "muddled." Perhaps,
in his case, as in that of many other depressed persons, he
had to be in a mental hospital mainly to protect him from

[p. <i>264</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00262&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>A Man Who, for Years, Was Just Unable to Work</b>


The story told by Elsa Krauch (<i>A Mind Restored</i>, 1937)
is one of the best about the mental troubles of a man who
was only slightly disturbed. Even when he was at his worst,
I doubt if anyone meeting him at a luncheon would have
noticed anything wrong with him, but technically he was
insane because occasionally he had to be hospitalized.


<i>Lack of ability to earn a living</i>. The only reason for Curran's
staying in a hospital as long as he did was that during
some of the years in which he was unable to earn his living,
when his family had gotten tired of taking care of him, he
needed board and lodging. Apparently he was always quiet
and inoffensive and well-behaved. His trouble was that he
had lost his drive, his business sense, and his ability to work.
He had a mild depression. He tells how for years he kept
slipping mentally. From being a prosperous businessman,
he "slid down hill," he lost his good judgment, and he became
a less and less efficient salesman until finally he couldn't
get or hold any job.


<i>The seeds of insanity can show up in childhood</i>. Even as
a child, Jim had been a great worrier. "I worried at night
until every member of the household was home. I worried
because I was afraid that someone would drop into the
cistern under the house. I even worried about my dog. I
often cried myself to sleep." His mother had never been
well, and she, also, cried a good deal. She had a severe
diabetes. Jim's father also was a great worrier.


Curran had an idea that his mental troubles started when
his girl broke their engagement of several years' standing,
but I suspect this was only a trigger that upset a man who
was basically unstable and inadequate to stand up to the
strains of life.


<i>The beginnings of the breakdown</i>. "Five years passed,
and then I began to notice changes in my personality--

[p. <i>265</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00263&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As time passed, Curran became so restless he decided to
do some of the traveling for his firm, and hence he started
out "on the road." "But wherever I was I wanted to be
somewhere else." "I couldn't stay at any one thing, whatever
it was, for very long. So I had to keep going." "Like so
many persons going insane, he soon began to suffer from
recurring abdominal pains. And as so often used to happen
when people suffered from a psychic pain in the abdomen,
the doctor promptly diagnosed appendicitis and rushed
Curran to a hospital for an operation. But, fortunately, the
patient was so restless that that same night he took French
leave. The doctor was furious at him, but the pain was gone,
and so there was no operation!


<i>Loss of business judgment</i>. Later, as Curran said, "I began
developing a new trait--obstinacy. I thought I knew better
than others what ought to be done. I had slipped so much
that I was no longer alert." So he sold his share in his
prosperous company and bought into a business in which
anyone could have told him he would lose his money.
Worse yet, later, when things started to go downhill, and
he saw the financial crash coming, he could not make a
move to get out. He just watched in a numb terror. "Procrastination
became my most predominant trait." He worried
and worried and became more and more inefficient and
tired. It was harder to think or to plan or to concentrate or
to do anything for any length of time. The worst of it was
that no one--not even he--guessed what was wrong. Then,

[p. <i>266</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00264&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Apparent laziness</i>. Like many people going insane, he
began to think he was physically ill. His friends thought he
was just lazy and stupid. He went back to selling but had
no luck. Like many people going insane, he didn't want
to see people, and he refused to see even old friends. He
started spending his evenings in a hotel lobby, smoking one
cigarette after another. About this time, his wife left him
and took the children with her. "My restlessness increased
from day to day. I walked and walked and walked." As we
have seen, this is a common trick of psychotic persons. Another
typical danger signal was his inability to read. This
is definitely a sign of a disintegrating mind. Another bad
sign was that he grew thinner and thinner. As so commonly
happens in these cases, it did not occur to his physician--
untrained in psychiatry--that there could be a mental basis
for all of his patient's discomforts. Only after Curran had
been going downhill <i>for five years</i> did the doctor send him
to a hospital and call in a neurologist.


<i>Relief on entering a general hospital</i>. Curran liked being
in the hospital, because there he didn't feel any distress
over his not working. He dreaded leaving the place because
that would bring back the problems of making a living. He
got better, and for a while his wife came back to him.


<i>He entered a mental hospital</i>. Next, he was put into a
mental hospital where he spent seven months. His friends
kept telling him there was nothing the matter with him,
but he only resented this.


For a while he was so negativistic that whenever anyone
asked him to do something, he did just the reverse. He refused
to bathe. He wouldn't play cards; all he did was to
walk up and down. He dreaded seeing people. Then he
left the hospital, unfortunately only a bit more bewildered.


<i>What they said he needed was a change</i>. "My relatives
then had a new idea. They said I needed ‘a change of
scene.’" Relatives often say that; and usually they make
a great mistake. His family sent him out West to do hard
physical work in a grocery. They told him to "snap out of

[p. <i>267</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00265&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Again, he went into a hospital.


About this time he became much distressed because his
family got disgusted with him. To them, he looked like a
lazy failure--entirely to blame for all of the mess he had
got into. Naturally, they became so hostile and bitter that
he came to look on them as his worst enemies.


<i>He had none of the usual symptoms of insanity</i>. Still
Curran had none of the usual symptoms of insanity, such
as delusions and hallucinations; he just felt terribly tired,
and uninterested in life. He gave up and decided he would
never be well again. All he asked for was some let-up in
his mental suffering. A year later, although he was no better,
he was released from the hospital. He worked a while as a
salesman, but still he would rarely speak to anyone outside
of the store. He couldn't even play cards as he formerly had
loved to do. He couldn't read a newspaper because he
couldn't grasp the meaning of what he read. He much
wanted sleep, but often that would not come.


<i>Common stupidities in the care of the insane</i>. Soon he had
to quit work, and so he had to go back to a hospital so as
to get bed and board. This time it was a state mental institution.
In this hospital, everyone had to get up at 5:30 in the
morning, no matter how badly he needed more sleep. This
was one of those curious relics of medievalism--an utterly
stupid regulation which no one had ever thought to change,
even though it must have been just as much of a nuisance
to the staff as to the patients.


As is the case with many derelicts in a state mental hospital,
Curran could have been cared for just as well in the
poorhouse. He had only a few queer sensations.


His family still thought him lazy, but as he says, he had
the laziness of a man with a broken leg. Interesting, as
showing how sane many legally insane persons can be,
Curran tells about a brilliant attorney in the hospital who
sometimes was borrowed by a lawyer in the nearby city to
help him try a difficult court case!


One of the best things that happened to Curran came one
day when it occurred to him that all his troubles hadn't

[p. <i>268</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00266&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>The need for help in convalescence</i>. Then came parole into
the home of a nice attendant who had grown fond of his
patient. As Curran said, "An interlude of this kind, between
institutional life and the responsibilities of the outside world,
can be of tremendous help. When Curran did go out into
the world on his own, he was glad when a friend got him
the job of running a freight elevator! This was lucky for
him because, for the next two years, he wasn't ready for a
job in which he would have to work with his brain.


Finally, he found he could do office work again, and
then he improved rapidly. Instead of daydreaming or feeling
bitter or sorry for himself, he began to "live almost
wholly in the present, without worrying too much about
yesterday or tomorrow." Eventually he again came to be
interested in other people and their problems, and as he
says, "That was a real triumph." The psychotic person is
generally too completely self-centered. He thinks only of
himself.


<i>Curran recovers</i>. Three years later Curran was pretty
much himself again. He expressed the hope that as time
passes we will have better facilities for the care of both
the person who is going insane and the one who has just
been discharged from a hospital. As he said, often it is a
mistake for a patient to go <i>home</i> upon dismissal. Too often
one of the causes for the person's attack of psychosis is to
be found in his home. There, perhaps, is a nagging wife, or
a domineering mother. Curran tells of some of his hospital
buddies who went home to a mean wife and there did about
the only thing they <i>could</i> do to escape her bitter tongue:
they committed suicide. Curran tells of a psychiatrist who
used to say that sometimes he wished, when he sent the
patient home, that for a time he could <i>lock up the family!</i>
If the relatives of the recently insane want their loved one
to stay well, they had better not keep telling him what "an
ornery and expensive bum" he has been.

<b>A Boat of Mild Insanity after an Operation</b>


Although Margaret Wilson (<i>Borderland Minds</i>, 1940) spent
five years in a mental hospital, at no time was she much
upset or confused or difficult to handle. She probably
wouldn't have been hospitalized if she had had a family
to take care of her. Unfortunately, when she became slightly
depressed, after an operation for gallstones, she was rooming
with a woman who couldn't very well take care of her.
As a result, she had to go into a hospital. She writes that,
on looking back over her early life, she could see how,
unwittingly, she had forged the chains that later were to
bind her, and how some mistakes and wrong decisions she
had made had led her into an unhappy maze from which
it was not easy to escape.


<i>Emotional immaturity from childhood on</i>. She tells how,
as a child, she was a "troublesome brat" who tended to fly
into passions. Later, she was a hoyden. In school, she was
very bright, but her "behavior was unsatisfactory; she was
emotionally immature.'" She was never very attractive to
men. She was a bit neurotic and inclined to nervousness.
She had indigestion and "colitis." Following her gallbladder
operation, she lay in coma for two days and was hardly
expected to five. She had either hysteria or a little stroke,
due perhaps to a lack of sufficient oxygen with her anesthetic.
She had to learn to talk all over again, and for a
while she stuttered. She became irritable, dyspeptic, apprehensive,
and unable to sleep. Then she grew despondent
and thought of suicide. Later, when she became manic, she
was very talkative, excitable, and unlike herself. She knew
she was in the borderland of insanity.


<i>Hospitalization</i>. On Christmas Eve of 1931, she was deceived
into going into an old-fashioned mental hospital
where the discipline was overly strict and every patient had
to take a dose of salts after supper! Cold packs were used
as a punishment, or as a threat of punishment.


On one occasion, Miss Wilson almost succeeded in committing
suicide by hanging. As she was contemplating
suicide, she was interested to read in Revelations 9:6, "And

[p. <i>270</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00268&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Some problems of a person in a mental hospital</i>. Very interesting,
and probably true, is Miss Wilson's statement that
if, in one's home, one has a bit of a tantrum or, because of
lack of appetite, fails to eat one's dinner, or fails to have a
bowel movement, nothing is thought of it; but in a mental
hospital, if one gets a bit miffed at someone, or has a tantrum,
or fails to eat, or fails to go to the toilet, the attendants
immediately chalk up a bad mark and assume that the patient's
insanity has taken a turn for the worse.


Miss Wilson makes an interesting point that many an
eminent person has gotten by for all his or her days with a
marked eccentricity such as would have been looked on
with alarm in a mental hospital. For instance, there was
Emily Dickinson, for years a recluse; Elizabeth Barrett
Browning, another recluse; "poor old Carlyle with his dyspepsia,
his melancholy and his bad temper"; Amy Lowell
with her cigar; Charles Lamb with his alcohol, his stuttering,
and his spells of depression; and Edgar Allan Poe with
his alcoholism. Miss Wilson suspects some of them might
have been locked up if someone had only turned them in!


<b>The Story of a Kindly Man with Just One Delusion</b>


William L. Moore (<i>The Mind in Chains</i>, 1955), a college-educated
ex-marine, after a year and a half in a mental
hospital, has always doubted if he ever was really insane.
In high school he became so strongly attached to a certain
teacher of his, a Mr. Armstrong, that he almost worshiped
him. Then, Armstrong died, and soon Moore got an idea in
his head that his old friend would some day return from
the grave, so that the whole world could appreciate his
greatness.


<i>Early psychic difficulties</i>. As so often happens in these
cases, when one goes back into the history of the patient,
one finds that from early life, Moore had some problems of
adjustment. Then, when he was seventeen, he had such an
argument with his father over a small matter that his father

[p. <i>271</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00269&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As Moore says, he always stood a bit apart from the
crowd. Others often compromised with their beliefs in order
to adjust to reality, but Moore couldn't. He says that often
he was too forthright and stubborn.


In 1937, his teacher noted that he was nervous and was
twitching and jerking a good deal. He became greatly interested
in the Children's Crusade of the Middle Ages.
After brooding over the tragic end of this crusade, Moore
started out one day with $1.15 in his pocket on what he
thought could be a bicycle trip to the eastern end of the
Mediterranean. Fortunately, that night, he decided that he
had better call off the trip and go home.


While at college Moore got the idea that his troubles had
all been part of a gigantic scheme to make him face adversity.
He felt that this had been planned for him by Mr.
Armstrong, and hence "he must have only <i>pretended</i> to be
dead. He must be directing everything from behind the
scenes. There could be no other explanation!"


<i>Moore is committed</i>. Apparently, Moore did enough curious
things so that his father had him placed in a state
hospital for treatment. Moore was one of those persons who
are practically normal except for one peculiar idea, which
they cannot believe is a delusion. So long as Moore maintained
that Mr. Armstrong was alive, the psychiatrists felt
that he had better stay in the hospital and be treated. He
had many insulin shock treatments, which he describes
magnificently. Every psychiatrist ought to read at least this
chapter of the book.


He says that after one has taken such treatments, one
knows what it is to die. After a session, "Gradually, I returned
to ‘normal’; my being rejoined this world. I was once
more what I used to be." "Going out under insulin is similar
to going to sleep. If the dose is large enough, there [is] no
recollection of the thought processes during the unconscious
period." His first impression was that "the physical world
had dissolved, and that I had left my body and was looking
at fife objectively. People were but phantoms or shadows,
and the walls of the institution had disintegrated. It took

[p. <i>272</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00270&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Moore recovers and decides to devote his life to helping
others</i>. Finally, in 1954, Moore was discharged from the
hospital. Ever since, he has been trying to help persons who
have been dismissed from a mental hospital.


Like so many persons who leave a mental hospital, Moore
immediately ran up against the terrible problem of where
to find a job suitable for a man of his education. As I write
this, Bill Moore, now my good friend, still hasn't the sort
of job he should have, with his education and his possibilities
for usefulness. To me, it is interesting to see that Bill,
who as a boy so much wanted to do some great thing for
the world, is still struggling to find some way in which he
can help his fellow men.


<b>An Excellent Description of a Period of Depression</b>


In an excellent book (<i>A Mind Mislaid</i>, 1937) Henry Collins
Brown tells of his breakdown. It seemed to be brought on
by the great disappointment of failing to be elected director
of a museum which he had spent years in building up. As so
many ex-insane people say, "If only I or my family had
known more about mental hygiene, and the early symptoms
of a nervous crack-up, my break might have been avoided."


Brown wrote interestingly and well, and with a certain
jauntiness which is pleasing. He showed how observant and
clear-minded a man in a mental hospital can be. After he
got well, he said, "Not only does a recovered patient dread
to speak of his illness, but he looks upon himself as having
brought disgrace on his family." "There are occasional exceptions,
and I am one." On his return to the world, he
made no secret of where he had been. Once, when he was
to speak before a big audience, he was introduced as the
only ex-crazy man who now brags about it! According to
Brown, many of the patients in a mental hospital are "in
there largely as the result of some damn-foolishness"; they
did not live wisely.


He said, "I am powerless to describe the abject terror

[p. <i>273</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00271&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>A plea for eugenics</i>. As Brown looked around him at many
of the poor specimens of humanity, he got to thinking about
the need for eugenics. One of the psychiatrists said that he
hoped that some day when two people plan to marry and
to raise children, they will look into the goodness or badness
of their stock, much as a breeder of race horses does
when he starts buying a stable. But, as the doctor said, none
of us are likely to live long enough to see that day. People
are not yet ready for this idea. For years to come, many a
young woman, when choosing a father for her children,
will look more at the size of the man's bank account than
at the badness of his heredity.


<i>An illness that came slowly and went slowly</i>. Brown saw
that, if only because his illness was a long time in coming,
it was a long time in going. There were many little relapses.
Brown did not recall ever having been muddled in his
thoughts, but for a while he was so depressed as to be utterly
indifferent. "In that state you seldom speak to anyone,
and then only to snarl. A constant state of hostility would
perhaps define the attitude." "Physical pain is bad enough,
but mental pain is a thousand times worse."


Brown could not say that any one particular thing brought
about his cure. As his spirits lightened, his body weight
went up. It had gone down from 180 to 113 pounds!


Then, as Brown said, and as so many depressed persons
say, "<i>the curtain began to go up</i>." After many months, he
got interested in things; and the idea of going out again into
the world somewhat lost its terror for him. Again, he could
talk with people.


<i>His intelligent interest in the stock market</i>. Brown maintained
that even when he was in bad shape, he retained his
interest in the stock market and what was happening there,

[p. <i>274</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00272&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later, as he improved, Brown became very unhappy because
he so missed his work. As he said, there is no blessing
so precious as work. But actually, he still was in no shape to
work. For a time, he didn't even want to get well. He preferred
the idea of dying, and for a while he fought his returning
health.


<i>The desire for suicide</i>. In a mental hospital the patient's
"urge to commit suicide is something that constantly
plagues the doctors." That is why each night all eyeglasses,
neckties, suspenders, and bathrobe belts are collected and
locked up. But even with all the watchfulness of the attendants
and all the precautions that are taken, each year a
number of the patients succeed in committing suicide.
Brown reminds us that many a person occasionally will say,
"I wish I were dead" without really meaning it. "The feeling
that comes over you when mentally ill is altogether different;
there is no comparison. The one is a passing emotion,
the other represents an absence of any desire to live." "The
natural fear of death, which we all have in normal moments,
no longer exists." "A mental depression is something unspeakably
horrible." The patient feels, "Why endure this
cruel tumult of the mind when peace is within reach?
Peace, blessed peace!" "The first law of Nature, self-preservation,
has completely broken down."


<i>His life in the hospital</i>. The struggle to conquer fear was
a bitter one. To return to the world seemed to be a terrible
ordeal. For a time he couldn't face a return to the old life.
For months he had been pacing the floor for 14 hours out
of each 24. Then came a sign of recovery--the walking began

[p. <i>275</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00273&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Curious is his statement that nothing was so annoying as
his having to witness the moving pictures that were shown
to the patients. This interests me because sometimes when
I want to find out if the patient sitting before me in the
office is sane, I just ask her, "Do you still enjoy the movies?"
Sometimes then she, who I suspect is going insane, says,
"I used to love the movies and went to see them every
chance I got, but now I won't go. I am now so wrapped up
in myself that I haven't the slightest interest in what those
people are doing."


As Brown says, thoughtless people keep saying to mentally
disturbed relatives, "Come now and snap out of it."
For a while this phrase greatly angered Brown, because
what he wanted most in the world was to "snap out of it."


Remarkable is Brown's description of a hypochondriac
of an extreme degree whom he knew in the hospital. This
man "spent most of his time examining a small swelling
on his forehead which he was convinced was a cancer." He
was constantly waylaying the doctors and asking them
about the "lump." They all told him it was a harmless projection
of his forehead, but such reassurance brought him
no comfort.


Interesting and instructive is Brown's description of the
griefs and terrors of Visitor's Day, when many a devoted
mother or father or wife of a patient travels far to see the
loved one--only to be snubbed or reviled in the most cruel
way. "A peculiarity of mental illness is that it turns you
against all those nearest and dearest to you." As Brown
says, it is very necessary that the relatives realize that the
cruel behavior of the patient is just a part of his illness and
hence must be forgiven. It must not keep the relatives from
returning.

[p. <i>276</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000842814-I00274&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Encouraging to many persons will be Brown's statement
that, in spite of his having interviewed many of the patients,
he never heard anyone say that he had been falsely locked
up by a relative who wanted his money. He describes some
of the alcoholics being "dried out" in the hospital. Some of
them bragged to Brown that on the afternoon of the day
of their release they would have a woman and a bottle and
be stinking drunk again!


Brown tells us how, in a mental hospital, the attendants,
whenever they have to take a number of patients from one
place to another, are always counting them to make sure
no one has slipped away and hidden somewhere. Brown
says he got the habit of counting like this so ingrained in
him that, for long after his release, when in an elevator he
would count the passengers in the car!


<i>Gradual improvement</i>. Eventually, Brown sensed the
"subsidence of something like a great storm at sea: the howling
wind died down, the tumult of the waves seemed spent,
and the tossing billows gradually sank to rest." Finally, there
came brief spells with "a glorious feeling of tranquillity."


One of the signs of Brown's return to health came when
he began again to read books and magazines and to write
letters home. Eventually, he was dismissed, well. Cheering
is his statement that on his return to New York City, all
but a very few of his old friends welcomed him as if nothing
had happened.


<b>A Spoiled Young Woman for Whom Life Became
Too Strenuous</b>


A good description of the impressions gained by someone
who enters a mental hospital with a mind fairly unclouded
is that of Marian King (<i>The Recovery of Myself</i>, 1931).
She was hospitalized because, for a while, she had been
taking too much Veronal (to help her sleep). Then she had
attempted suicide. Luckily, the doctors at the emergency
hospital had quickly saved her.


She was a young woman of the smart set who drove herself
to do too many things. She drove herself until she
cracked up. Doubtless she had an inborn tendency to be

On entering the hospital, she was shocked, as so many
other patients are shocked, on seeing bars on the windows
and on hearing the click of the lock as she was shut into
her room. As so often happens, the girl's family had been
unwise in not telling her what type of hospital she was
headed for, and hence it upset her much when some fellow
patients came in and said, "You are in the bug-house all
right!"


As commonly happens in most hospitals, during the first
few days, when the girl sadly needed rest and sleep, and
should have had it, someone was constantly coming into
her room, either to take a history or make an examination,
or make some tests, or take some blood, or take her temperature.
Even some of the other patients were allowed to come
into her room to bother her. That she was slightly psychotic
at the time is indicated by the fact that for several days she
was negativistic and unwilling to eat. Also, when she refused
to get out of bed, it took four attendants to get her
up. She admits that at times she was so unsocial she would
shut herself up in her room.


<i>The factors that led to the breakdown</i>. The girl tells us
how, as often happens in these cases, she had been overdoing,
and getting more and more tired and more and
more unable to sleep, until finally, on her own, she started
taking Veronal in large doses. She says that for months she
had strained every nerve to keep up with the strenuous and
exacting demands which her life had made on her. She
would not complain to her parents or let them know that
she was overtired. She feared to disgrace the family by not
attaining high marks. Worse yet, she who was being forced
along so hard in college, was going to art school; she was
trying to learn to write stories; she was playing almost
championship tennis; she had taken an active part in a
field meet, and she had had to train for a charity benefit
performance. Finally, in the evenings she had been doing
some dating!

Then, she had to face problems of adjustment to life--
problems of selfishness, problems of feigning illness to get
out of work, problems of taking Veronal to drown her disappointments
and help her with her problems of handling
her parents so as always to get her own way. As she said,
if she could not get what she wanted in one way, she would
get it in another way. She admitted that her skill in getting
herself more and more spoiled had led her into the mental
illness.


<i>The early symptoms of brain fatigue</i>. Very important is
Miss King's statement that there came a time when she
could not concentrate. "Try as I would, I became restless
and could not apply myself to a thing.... Sleep would not
come. Do you know what it means to he awake as the minutes
drag into hours, fevered with the weight of the night,
reaching for rest with your two hands?"


<i>Her impressions in the hospital</i>. Because Miss King was
not much disturbed mentally, she was soon moved to an
unlocked section of the hospital. Even in this unusually well-run place, she gained the impression that if some of the
patients had been handled in a more gentle way they
would not so greatly have resented their confinement.


Miss King admits she made many demands, and sometimes,
when her requests were not immediately granted,
she "became a picture of seething resentment."


As she wrote to her mother, when she was getting better,
"I think that all my trouble lies in the fact that I never
sought your confidence, no matter how much you asked for
mine. I have learned now, Mother, what it is to confide in
someone." She came to see that often she had made trouble
for herself. This brought discontent upon her, and then
she turned to the drug. When she entered the hospital, she
told the doctor that her only fear was that she would not
always get her own way. Later, suddenly, she saw herself
as a spoiled child. But, as she said, "I have always been
that way."


In the last weeks in the hospital, while Miss King was
putting together picture puzzles, it suddenly occurred to
her that when she came in, she herself was like a picture
puzzle with the pieces all in a heap. The good psychiatrists
