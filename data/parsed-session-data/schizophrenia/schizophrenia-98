-NANCY VAHEY RAPPAPORT, <br />
LETTER TO JEROME RAPPAPORT


Choosing to leave a marriage is never a casual move. When two bodies come
together to make one and then many more, how is it possible that they can
separate without an explosion? Even blessed marriages have their crisis moments,
times when it is hard to believe there is a way around an apparently
permanent impasse. It is easy to worry whether love can inform the art of
reconciliation or if the impasse is a sign of impending loss.


Research psychologist John M. Gottman analyzed the patterns of marital
success and failures in order to identify difficulties and teach couples
more productive ways to communicate. He devised a questionnaire he hu
morously called his marital "poop" detector to assess how life was going in
the partnerships he studied. His diagnostic tools can sometimes seem as if
they've been pulled from the pages of Cosmo, in that they involve checking
to see if a partner feels "emotionally distant" or "irritable" or is "fighting

[p. <i>112</i>]

more than usual," but Gottman's methods are actually based on twenty-five
years of longitudinal research on more than 600 couples as well as detailed
analysis of 3,000 additional marriages.


Having observed so many marriages, Gottman claims he can predict
which marriages will fail. He says that marriages in crisis share key behaviors--the
"four horsemen of the apocalypse," which are "corrosive to marriage."
These are <i>criticism</i>, especially the kind where one spouse starts a
diatribe with "You always" or "You never"; <i>defensiveness</i>, or the evasion of
responsibility for one's action; <i>stonewalling</i>, in which one or both partners
become impassive or withdraw from the communication as a form of self-soothing;
and <i>contempt</i>, which is characterized by sarcasm, eye-rolling, and
teasing that are experienced as humiliating by the partner. A high degree of
contempt expressed between two partners is seen as the single best predictor
of divorce, "the sulfuric acid of love." If negative exchanges also outweigh
the positive ones, the marriage is doomed.


Couples in trouble, Gottman writes, have repeated "failure of repair"
whereby the partners feel that the same problems keep coming up again
and again with little progress toward resolution. One partner may feel that
the other is making unreasonable demands or may feel attacked unfairly
or disregarded. It can feel like gridlock--every argument heats up and interactions
grow nastier and more intense. In these situations, Gottman asserts,
solving problems (as some couples' therapists try to do) is not the
answer. Instead, he recommends that couples learn how to live with differences,
figure out how to de-escalate, keeping things lighter and more
humorous between them. If each partner can give up some power, the couple
may find a compromise and move forward. Over time, they can develop
greater flexibility.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_3328');">[note]</a><div id="_note_3328" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. John Mordechai Gottman, <i>The Marriage Clinic: A Scientifically Based Marital
Therapy</i> (New York: W. W. Norton, 1999).</div>


But what Gottman recommends is a tall order. I wish my parents could
have pulled it off. Looking back at their relationship, I wonder if their divorce
would have been averted if they'd had good referees like Gottman.
Once there is irreparable damage, the decline is rapid. It follows a somber,
three-phase pattern described by noted divorce researchers Judith Wallerstein

[p. <i>113</i>]

and Shauna Corbin.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_3930');">[note]</a><div id="_note_3930" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">2. Judith S. Wallerstein and Shauna B. Corbin, "The Child and the Vicissitudes
of Divorce," in <i>The Scientific Basis of Child Custody Decisions</i>, edited by R. M.
Galatzer-Levy and L. Kraus (New York: Wiley, 1999).</div> This well-trod path will be familiar to anyone
who has been involved in a vitriolic divorce.


The tone of the first or "acute" phase is set by the fact that divorce in a
family with children is rarely a mutual decision. This acute phase is filled
with drama, highly emotional responses, and escalating conflict. Sometimes
there is physical violence between parents--even if neither spouse has been
violent before. Wallerstein and Corbin note that both parents may have
thoughts of suicide.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_4679');">[note]</a><div id="_note_4679" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">3.Ibid.</div> They may accuse each other of betrayal and revenge.
They may misinterpret what the other intends and have exaggerated responses
to minor insults. In addition, parents in the acute phase of a marriage
breakdown often have lapses of judgment, act rashly on sexual urges,
and behave immaturely. This acute phase may be brief, or it may last several
years. Some couples remain trapped at this stage, reenacting the drama over
and over again in a futile effort to change the outcome.


This acute phase is followed by a "transitional" phase in which the couple
disentangle from each other's lives. They may find increasing satisfaction
with new friends, work, and time for self-discovery. However, as
families readjust, this stage can be stressful. The "final" phase involves the
establishment of post-divorce households with single or remarried parents--households
that are relatively stable but may experience awkward
adjustments along the way. I don't know if my parents ever actually got to
the supposed second phase, much less the third, but then again, I'm not
sure <i>divorce</i> is even the most apt term for their conflict.


It's difficult to read anyone else's marriage or conflict from the outside.
In my parents' case it can also feel particularly intrusive, as I try to piece together
something that happened forty years ago, which was further com
plicated by the fact that my mother made a suicide attempt right after their
separation and killed herself after the divorce. As my father says, exasperated,
"Who are you to rekindle a mishmash of events that are not pictured
in entirety?" I will never know why my mother gave up on her marriage or
why she needed to leave in a way that hurt and shamed my father. It is easier
sometimes to make up a script about why the separation and divorce

[p. <i>114</i>]

happened, and what role each partner played, to make it more understandable.


The sequence of events I find are sketchy. My mother left our home after
the affair started with Dick and she temporarily moved in with a neighbor,
Elaine Werby. She made a suicide attempt during a fight with my father,<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_6909');">[note]</a><div id="_note_6909" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">4. "Wife Wasted Cash," <i>Record American</i>, June 14, 1962.</div>
and it is hard for me to place what was going on when this happened--she
had returned to our home to see if she could reconcile with my father. He
declined and she took an overdose. After this suicide attempt, she made a
financial settlement and signed a custody agreement that gave custody to
my father and my grandmother Edith and also allowed her liberal visitation
at our home. She then moved into a two-bedroom apartment with Dick
Sears, and during her visitation with her children the negotiations with my
father became increasingly contentious. She returned to court to fight for
the return of her children.


My father, who was reticent with details until recently, noted that one of
his biggest mistakes was not to reconcile with my mother. From his vantage
point, here was someone (Dick) who came into his household and had
an affair with his wife. He didn't think it was fair to the kids that their
mother was wandering in and out of their lives while she was having an affair.
When he found out she had gone off with Dick to Tanglewood, Dad
was hopeful that he could get her to end it, but she chose to stay with Dick.
He told me that he "cared most about you kids, and [he] was willing to give
her financially what she needed," but he was too hurt to take her back later.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_8304');">[note]</a><div id="_note_8304" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">5. Jerome Rappaport, personal interview, February 9, 2009.</div>


Elaine Werby reappeared after thirty years (she says that my father had
discouraged her from having contact with us while we were growing up)
when my sister Judy arranged for a visit to my mother's grave. It was the
first visit with my brothers, sisters, and father together, and Elaine joined
us. I kept her phone number for ten years after this memorial service, and
when I was trying to understand more about what happened with my
mother I decided to see if Elaine was willing to talk with me. She was.


Elaine Werby was my mother's close friend and knew my parents for nine
years; she is 77 now, with a warm smile, an elegant dress, and a hoarse voice.

[p. <i>115</i>]

My mother stayed with Elaine and her husband after she left my father. She
told me with great enthusiasm,


I was crazy about your mother. She was very smart. Such good
times. ... We would sit around the pool in summer and the
kids would swim and we would yak and talk about politics. We
were on the board of the League of Women Voters and we were
drawn together by geography since we both lived in West Roxbury.
We were the two ethnics on the League, your mother representing
the Irish, me the Jewish, and most Brahmins saw us
belonging together. As two couples we would go to movies, go
to dinner, go to the house. One evening, your parents came
back from Paris; it was your mother and father's first trip, she
was absolutely gorgeous, she wore a purple cloche hat. They
had brought back dirty books that were contraband at the time
and we sat around--my Jerry, your dad, and your mother--and
we were hysterical reading.


After your mother finished the fund-raising drive as chairman
of the United Fund, she needed something that was hers.
She wanted to be more interesting to people. She liked being
<i>somebody</i> whenever she felt let down and she conceived of the
idea of running for School Committee. She had an idea of strategy
that was wonderful. She never really articulated it but she
always felt a mission to carry on what her family did--she felt
that they had shaped Boston politics. Your father had made
such a name as a do-gooder at the beginning with Hynes; this
was something where she needed to be on her own. She was
proud of her family and political role all tied up also with her


own ego. She had enormous charisma. I always felt that either
people were drawn into her orbit or they didn't like her at all.
I raised questions to Nancy when she chose to have Dick run
her campaign.

[p. <i>116</i>]

I was naive and it took me a while to figure out what was
going on. The summer that she was running for School Committee,
I saw your mother every day and I didn't see anything.
Dick was in and out. Your father called me and I was startled
because he was crying. That was his first open emotion and he
said that your mother was gone and he didn't know where.


The sequence is fuzzy when your mother came back from
Alabama, where she had gone to get a quick divorce. She asked
to stay with me. I remember for three weeks she was living up
on the third floor in our attic. Dick Sears came to visit in the
afternoon. ... My husband was annoyed that I had taken your
mother in ... afraid that I would get in the middle and advised
me just to not get involved. I remember wondering where she
was going to get the money to move. She got a financial settlement
when she signed an agreement giving custody to your
grandmother and your father [she had daily visitation]. When
she signed the agreement that allowed her to move with Dick
Sears into a beautiful small apartment, on a corner downtown
in a walk-up on the second floor, that was the beginning of the
end of our friendship. ... She was so engrossed with Dick.


She continued, her voice heavy: "When she moved into the apartment in
late September, she was <i>so</i> convinced that she would have no trouble get
ting the children back. During six months she worked out an arrangement
of kids coming to her apartment and her visiting at the house.


"Those visits intensified. She kept going back to court and each time she
would think that she was going to get you back. You couldn't dissuade her.
And it would be another blow. It was more than she could bear. She was
leaving you all with your grandmother. Edith would supervise your care
while your mother figured out her next move. I couldn't believe it at the
time how Edith could back your father." She paused. "I am not sure what her
finances were but your grandmother was living on Jerry's largess and she
wasn't going to threaten it."

[p. <i>117</i>]

I asked her about Dad and Mama's marriage.


"It was very hard to tell with your Dad and Nancy. ... They were very
competitive, which was a problem. Your mother and father loved kids, and
loved the idea of having a lot of kids. Your dad had a quick temper. Your
mother may have had unrealistic expectations. It must have been difficult
that your grandmother was there all the time though she was an integral
part of the household running smoothly. She had a major role with the kids
but it must not have been easy to have her around."


Yet my investigation into my mother's life as I read her journals and look at
court documents adds to the complexity. She was struggling with excruciating
decisions. She worried that, if she followed her desire for Dick, it
would kill her as the person she was and that she would damn herself. In her
journals, she's caught in depression's torment, losing her equilibrium, knowing
that she was making an agonizing choice that seemed to eat away at her
natural self-preservation.


All my life I've been like a peeled onion with all my nerve endings
exposed, and all sorts of feelings have rushed through. ...
I'd say that I have had a marvelous life, with all sorts of wonderful
sensations coming through me, until lately. And now
someone has put the skin back on, and I can't feel the pain, because
I won't l00k at it, but I can't feel the pleasure, either. ...


Long and uncertain stretched the smooth black road, urging
one into forgetfulness, deceiving one into day dreams,
long, long, long--long black insomniac nights broken only by
the white line of consciousness and ... hateful solitudes, as
indistinguishable from one another as curves and crossroads
before the headlights. Consciousness, uniqueness, slowly
drains away from the asphalt and from the cottony, lonely
wakefulness until finally there is nothing but the black road
ahead and death. ... Death is a change in degree rather than

[p. <i>118</i>]

in kind, and for many of us is a blessing in neon rather than in
disguise.


On September 12, two weeks before their divorce would be final, four
months after the affair with Dick had started, and one month since she had
dropped out of the School Committee campaign, my mother went to the
Quail Street house to talk to my father. By some accounts, she was there to
reconcile with him, to apologize and ask forgiveness--perhaps defiance was
too difficult for her and came with too much risk. My father could not forgive
at that time. My mother swallowed three handfuls of the sleeping pills
that she had been prescribed for her insomnia and "nerves." Dad found her,
groggy on the bed with a bottle next to her. He immediately knew there
was something wrong and called for an ambulance. It scared the hell out of
him.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_16171');">[note]</a><div id="_note_16171" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">6. Ibid.</div> She was taken out of the house on a stretcher, my sister Judy remembers.
Dick Sears told me that Dad called him to meet them at the emer
gency room, which is somewhat mystifying to me. Dick told me that when
he arrived at the hospital he "was desolate, shocked. She came close to
killing herself that time. I had never seen the panicked side of her before.
It was all a mystery to me. ... I never had an understanding of why, and she
did not tell me anything beyond that she couldn't take it anymore."


My older sister Amy adamantly insists that my mother was simply "distraught."
She spent five days at Faulkner Hospital. When she was released
she returned to Elaine's house where she signed an agreement to give custody
to my father (with Grandma Edith as co-custodian) and reached a financial
settlement. She needed time to recover and to work out a plan. I am
puzzled as to how Elaine can remember so many details about spending
time with my mother but remains "blocked" about my mother's suicide attempt
when I ask her.


It's hard not to look at my mother's writing as an ominous prediction of her
eventual suicide--as a long suicide note to her children. But I also realize

[p. <i>119</i>]

now that writing was a way she had of working out her first suicide attempt
that September, an honest effort at trying to understand who she was and
how she had come to that point--her way of comprehending so she could
find strength not to do it again. As my parents fought, as she downed the
pills, my father was terrified by my mother's recklessness. Now, as a parent,
I can sympathize with my father's fear and his desire to protect us from
her behavior. In that moment, she was capable of anything.


In my mother's novel, Diane wonders whether her husband Peter would
accept her death guilt-free or if he would be "overcome with remorse and
self-disgust" after her suicide. Remorse does not come easily to my father.
If my mother had been looking for this reaction, she did not get what she
wanted from him. Instead of bringing remorse, her suicide attempt only
distanced them further.


It must have been frightening to her, too, to realize that she could swallow
so many pills so easily, and so easily punish my father by dying. If she
sometimes could not stop herself or even recognize what she was doing,
then surely she was at risk of dying. She needed to quiet her racing thoughts
and take time to think them through.


The divorce was finalized on September 25, 1961. The next day, the preliminary
elections for Boston School Committee were held, and Louise Day
Hicks was victorious.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_18907');">[note]</a><div id="_note_18907" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">7. As a member of the Boston Schoo Committee, Louise Day Hicks garnered
national attention for opposing the desegregation of Boston's public schools. For
many, Hicks personified intolerance and contributed to the prevailing view that
Boston was a racist city. In 1976 she became the first woman president of the
Boston City Council.</div> By this time, my mother had no thought of any political
victories--she needed to steady herself.


Curious to find out more about this period in her life, I requested the divorce
decree from the state of Alabama. It starts out innocuously, specifying
that my parents had lived together for ten years and had six children
and that they had agreed on a separation agreement with reference to the
support, custody, and maintenance of minor children. But I was stunned by
what I read next: that my father "committed actual violence on the person
of complainant [my mother]; attended with danger to her life or health or
from his conduct there was reasonable apprehension of such violence." In

[p. <i>120</i>]

a response, my father protested this characterization and "denies allegations"
and demanded "strict proof." Dad recently explained to me (when I
got up the nerve to ask him about this), "The laws of divorce were archaic
in the '6os. There were only limited grounds for divorce--it had to fit
within circles. There was a long mishmash, and somebody took the hit.
There was nothing like irreconcilable differences; someone had to have an
affair or somebody got hit ... stupid way to get divorced. Alabama and Nevada
were the two states that competed to be the divorce capital to expedite
the process, and your mother went to Alabama."<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_20660');">[note]</a><div id="_note_20660" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">8. Jerome Rappaport, personal interview, February 9, 2009.</div>


As she took time to heal in the autumn months, my mother started seeing
a physician regularly and a psychiatrist three times a week, documenting
the appointments in a leather-bound date book. My grandmother Edith had
a hip fracture and needed to be in the hospital. With my grandmother's role
as caretaker temporarily suspended, my mother became more vigilant to
safeguard her children at Quail Street, following our every move to the extent
that my father permitted. My father made sure that there were always
two or three adults in the house when he was working and tried to help us
accept the change and get used to the comings and goings. However, even
with the best intentions he was bound to miss Martha's homework assignments
or little Jerry's performance or when I required a nap. My mother
yearned to share our daily routines--she wanted to bathe us, talk to us about
school, and comfort us. I know from working with children that parents
draw their children close when there is a crisis, and in my mother's case
she might not have known how to explain what was hard for her to understand
herself. My sisters and brothers could not understand why my mother
had moved out of our home even though she was visiting most days. Amy
remembers that my father told her that my mother had given away her children.
But Amy knew better. In my mother's papers I find short notes--proof
of love--written by my sister:

[p. <i>121</i>]

<i>Dear Mr. Sears and Mama</i>,


<i>I love you very much! I hope you both see us all soon. .1 like to be at your
house, I like the toy I have</i>.


<i>Love, Amy</i>


My mother writes wistfully, "Only the mother can hear the cry of her
child." She details the small and large conflicts she was having with my father,
who only grudgingly conformed to their arrangement that I find
archived in the courts: "[D]uring such periods as the custody shall not be
in the wife, the wife shall have the right to visit all said children at all reasonable
times, free of supervision, control or the presence of any person. ...
The wife shall be consulted in all substantial matters affecting their health,
education, religious training, and summer camp and the decisions relating
thereto should be by mutual agreement." Yet the access did not happen easily.
She was allowed to come to our home only as an unwelcome visitor.
Her entries capture the intensity of my parents' antagonism and mutual
hurt. After Thanksgiving, as my mother's strength and frustration increased,
their situation escalated into a high-stakes tug-of-war over decisions about
parenting and visitation. The affair between my father and Barbara had become
more serious. Everything--the money, the punch bowls, visitation
arrangements--triggered another confrontation. I read through her diary
with the sad realization that their bitterness was allowing no room for cooperation
or compromise.

[He] refused little Nancy any time because it was too difficult
to get her in and out on her schedule. He hung up and called
back and apologized. Agreed that he hadn't been letting me

[p. <i>122</i>]

see Nancy enough and she'd be coming Sun. and Mon., so Sat.
wasn't the best possible day.


Never told me about school recital or Mother's Visiting Day
11/9. I said so and he said he figured the children would tell
me. Little Jerry is just four and lisps and wouldn't know time
anyway. He agreed that he should have told me about Mother's
Day but nothing important. GRR.


Said he'd give me $1,800 for a $2,500 car, I said no, $2,500.
And he could have that back if he'd give me the car plate. He
said he'd do it for $2,000. I called him a cheap bastard, which
he is.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_24687');">[note]</a><div id="_note_24687" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">9. It was politically prestigious at the time to have license plates whose digits
were four or fewer in number: The Brahmins usually had the three-digit plates;
the politicians, four.</div>


Refused punch bowl and cups (we have 2 and 150 cups,
none of which will be used over weekend).


On Christmas Day, despite the constant bickering, my mother embraced
the festivities of a family tradition. She prepared a feast and wrapped piles
of presents. This was "her holiday," and she forged ahead, never mind that my
father was holding hostage the punch bowl with its matching cups. She and
Dick hosted a small tree-trimming party in their apartment. She welcomed
old friends and held her head up and looked vibrant. When she was compli
mented on her appearance and asked if there was something different, she
quipped that the improvements had come from divorcing my father.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_25619');">[note]</a><div id="_note_25619" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">10.

custody case), personal interview, May 2005.</div>


But the brief festivities quickly deteriorated.


THURS. DECEMBER 28TH


Called at 11:15 am, not having heard from the children yet.
Jerry still refused to let me talk to them, but agreed to let me
have little Jerry. When I arrived at 1:15 was told that little Jerry
was going to the movies (he's only 4!!). He wanted to do that
instead of be with me. Jimmy decided to come instead. I
started toward my mother's r00m to get some things she

[p. <i>123</i>]

needed in the hospital. Jerry told me he'd get what I needed. I
said don't bother. ... I said all I want is some clothes for
Mother. He said you can't get them and turned and pushed me.
I pushed back and he started hitting me hard around the head.


We were then at the banister and Bee [our housekeeper]
tried to separate us saying, "Watch out for the banister," at
which time I realized he was pushing me halfway over. He let
go when Amy and Judy came out of Mother's room crying and
begging him to stop. But then he started in again twice
more. ... He then refused to allow Jimmy to come with me,
screaming and trying to pull Jimmy out of my arms. Jimmy as
often cried "Daddy I wish you'd get the divorce and leave me
with Mamma." He took him aside and said, "Don't let your
mother make you choose between us, Jimmy." Jimmy told him,
"But I do. I love Mamma. I hate you." I told him he didn't hate
Daddy and that because he wanted to be with me didn't mean
he didn't love Daddy. Jerry screamed at me for about fifteen
minutes with Judy, Jimmy and Amy clinging to me and crying. ...
He was saying things like, "You're crazy, a lousy
mother, always were, never loved them. ..." He was VERY
upset. Finally, he let Jimmy come with me and Judy will come
tomorrow, though he had been saying I wasn't fit to see them.


No one deserves to be hit; it upset me to know that my father hit my mother
in the head. No one in my family had ever talked about hitting, so I asked
my sister Amy if she remembered. Amy remembers the hitting. Martha tells
me it doesn't matter if he slapped her forty years ago.


During my next meeting with Dr. Johnson, I read the entries to her in
choked despair, indignant for my mother forty years later and struggling
with my loyalty to my father. Trying to understand what happened to my

[p. <i>124</i>]

family, I have to acknowledge with sadness that my father was apparently
abusive at that moment.


James Gilligan, a researcher with extensive experience working with men
who have been violent, contends that "the first lesson that tragedy teaches
us is that all violence is an attempt to achieve justice, or what the violent
person perceives as justice for himself." But Gilligan cautions that "explanations
are not to be confused with exculpations." Just as it is important for
me to understand my mother's sorrow and fear, it is also necessary to examine
my father's rage. Gilligan writes that he has "yet to see a serious act of violence
that was not provoked by the experience of feeling shamed and
humiliated, disrespected and ridiculed, and that did not represent the attempt
to prevent or undo this 'loss of face' no matter how severe the pun
ishment, even if it includes death.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_29183');">[note]</a><div id="_note_29183" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">11. James Gilligan, <i>Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic</i> (New York: Vin
tage Books, 1997), pp. 11, 110.</div> Dr. Johnson reminds me that none of
this seems fair.


When my mother left my father, she injured him profoundly. When she
chose so publicly to live with Dick Sears, it was a special form of humiliation
aimed at my father. She left, but she did not make a graceful exit.


I think of myself as well schooled in the tragedies of violence. I make my
living trying to understand why children are aggressive and how to prevent
this behavior. I appreciate how shame can fuel anger, and I don't want to be
judgmental of my father. I do not write about this incident as an act of betrayal,
though I fear he will see it that way. I will not overlook his devotion,
his dignity, his love, his steadfast interest in the people his children have become,
or his presence and involvement in our lives. My father has a fierce
and justified pride in his parenting and by any standard he more than managed
to balance the demands of work and family while we were growing
up. I don't want to reduce him to nothing but a man who used his physical
power to intimidate my mother. He can be more generous than that and he
has learned from history.


Anna Freud emphasized that children may not have perfect recall and
that there is a dynamic force that shapes how they construct their meaning.
She wrote that "human beings are acquainted with only a fragment of their
own inner life, and know nothing about a great many feelings and thoughts

[p. <i>125</i>]

which go on within them, that is to say, all these things happen uncon
sciously without their awareness. ... [T]he importance of any event is by
no means a guarantee of its permanence in our memory; indeed, on the
contrary, it is just the most significant impressions that regularly escape
recollection." I know that if I were at the banister watching, at an age when
I was too young to have verbal memory (the language of affect), I would be
left with an unspeakable fear that my father could use force and intimidation.
I have often worried that angering him could be dangerous,
threatening to my security, and I've been frightened by the consequences.
My mother's words leave me with the visceral dread that I did see this, peering
down the hall, holding Amy's hand, terrified of the yelling and hitting.
I feel as if I have traced an insidious fear of my father (which has tempered
over the years)--what Anna Freud described as "the forgotten act of the
inner world [that] has the curious characteristic of retaining its dynamic
force when it disappears from memory.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_31923');">[note]</a><div id="_note_31923" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">12.

they were excruciatingly vulnerable as they watched our family breaking
apart. Many of the most significant findings from clinical case studies highlight
the intense reactions of children exposed to conflict between their
parents. Family researcher Ava L. Siegler writes that children who witness
domestic violence "live in terror that they or their parents will be hurt and
in guilt that they are helpless to do anything about it. This terror makes
children... feel ashamed about their inability to stop the hostilities between
their parents." This terror can be worse if the abuse is chronic. Such experiences
exaggerate the sense of weakness of the children in the face of adult
power and can "erode their self-regard."<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_33130');">[note]</a><div id="_note_33130" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">14. Ava L. Siegler, "Home Is Where the Hurt Is: Developmental Consequences

learn "bitter lessons" when they are "caught in the crossfire of intimate aggression."
Most learn that a parent they love can frighten them; many learn
that a parent they love can hurt.


During the time that I was finding out this upsetting information, my
stepmother Phyllis and my father were concerned that I was growing increasingly
withdrawn. I agreed to meet with my father to figure out how to

[p. <i>126</i>]

explain my distance, and also wanted to ask him why he hit my mother
when he knew she was so fragile.


It was devastating to talk with my father. He told me that my mother was
a big woman and capable of defending herself. He was furious that I would
question him. I left him and went to the bathroom. Putting my head against
the cool wall, I went down on my knees; torn with my loyalty to my father
and disappointed that I was on the defensive, I begged for strength from
God, from the love for my mother, to go on.


When I arrived home spent, there was a package from my mother's best
friend Peggy Melgard. She had written me a note saying that she'd found a
few more of my mother's papers that must have fallen out of the trunk that
Peggy had sent to us before and she thought that I would want them. There
were more diary entries that spoke of my mother's frustration at not being
able to comfort us. The battle between my parents had escalated to the point
that her children were like human torpedoes, and she seemed thwarted
even as she appealed to the courts and the police for help. The urgency and
immediacy to reach us had added meaning when she lamented in court,
"No mother can imagine what it means to be separated from her children."<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_35267');">[note]</a><div id="_note_35267" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">15.

Although she admits that my father "had said that I would always be their
mother," there is a tragic sense that her authority was undermined:


TUESDAY, MARCH 20


9:30 I called my mother to see which children were still sick,
having promised Martha and Amy on Monday that I would visit
them again on Tuesday. Mother said JLR [my father] thought
he was sick t00 and I said that was t00 bad but I'd see her
around 11:00. Immediately Jerry [my father] called. "Nancy it
doesn't make sense for you to come out today. Come out tomorrow."
I told him I had promised the children and would see
him s00n then hung up. Ten minutes later he called to tell me
he had spoken to the court and the police and if I appeared at

[p. <i>127</i>]

the house I would be evicted. I asked if he had spoken to Judge
Casey himself and he said yes. I said I'd call and see about that,
which I did right away. The judge was already sitting and I left
a message, calling again at the noon recess. The court officer
said the judge would speak to neither party in the case and
could do nothing but if a law had been violated it was a police
matter and I should inform them.


About 1:30 I arrived at Div 17, W.R. [West Roxbury], asked
for Cap. Hogan and showed him the agreement and told him
the story. He said he'd see if he could get a plainclothesman to
accompany me to the house and went to the poker room returning
with Det. or Lieut. Jerry Sweeney. He said JLR was a
lawyer and knew his rights and could throw any cop out unless
a felony was in progress. I burst into tears and asked if I had
to be beaten again to get their help. They all commiserated
then. Jerry Sweeney, after much talk about using reason, called
JLR and requested permission for me to visit my sick children.
JLR refused them. Sweeney went in another room. JLR called
him back and became convinced by him to give me an hour
with the children. He was alright at the house but my mother
and two oldest children were furious with him. ALL the cops
thought he was extremely unreasonable but claimed the Alabama
decree had no validity and they couldn't help me unless
he hit me again, but that I should hurry and get to court.


Also in the envelope were a few handwritten pages given the title "Problems
of a Long-Distance Mother": To me it could almost have been an article
in a parenting magazine. She instructed about the importance of
"setting up the atmosphere in which the children can grow--warm, loving,
unsophisticated, relaxed, yet preparing them for each new step in their
development and presenting that step at the right time--in the right way.
This requires intimate knowledge and frequent 'lightening' supervision of

[p. <i>128</i>]

myriad minor aspects of their environment which, actually, are the whole."
Then she set down a list of "typical day's problems," which conveyed her
anxiety that she was not able to create the kind of nurturing that comes
with the small decisions that weave a durable protective connection.


What to wear to school?


Whether a cold is severe enough to remain at home?


Getting there on time


Practicing piano, etc. Should it be continued if it is sloughed off
too often?


Who picks up sick child from school?


Must naps be taken today or will earlier bedtime suffice?


Bath and supper-time quietly and quickly observed (whose
slippers? Bathrobes today?)


Warm or cool pajamas?


Peanut butter and marshmallow held to a minimum


May we swim today?


Who fed the chickens?


Whose bike may I borrow?


Birthday plans and their carrying out ...


When should the dentist look at those teeth, which NOW need
brushing?


Public or private school?


Local recitals, parents' days, conferences with teachers, scout
leaders, etc.


Does the baby's diaper rash need the doctor's attention or just the
diaper-changer's?


Gamma-globulin for measles?


Television figures on pajamas?


Coloring or wrestling after supper?


Pigtails or pony-tail?


Who needs aspirin?

[p. <i>129</i>]

Who needs a little extra time alone or with a parent?


Why doesn't Martha do her homework sooner and more carefully?


I consider similar questions almost every day. I have had to be fairly resourceful
in finding good advice to guide my own parenting--sometimes I
think that if she'd stuck around, my mother would have provided useful
counsel around the endless and sometimes agonizing executive decisions
parents make. These are the small, intimate details of children's lives, the
things that should matter. By making such a list, I think my mother was
holding on to a hope, reassuring herself that she was a savvy mother, not
only well-intentioned but also sure-footed, one who would not be willingly
banished or seen as "unfit." I sense that in writing her list, Mama realized
she had created an absence by moving out. She seems hell-bent on reassuring
herself that she will be good to her word, that she will be there when
we need her. If only she could have delivered.


I have questions of my own that she might have considered:


Why are the parents so mad and fighting?


What is it about?


Who should the children live with, mother or father?


How to explain suicide attempt?


What should children call their parents' lovers?


Who is watching when children are in the pool?


Why can't the children be with their mother?


When can I let you go?
