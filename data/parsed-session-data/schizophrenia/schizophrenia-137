ISLEEPILY opened my eyes and lay staring up at the ceiling.
After a few minutes I thought: ‘How strange that it is so
light,’ and I moved my head round on the pillow. The pillow
was soft; I was lying between sheets and for a moment I
thought I was back at the Convent, then I remembered that
I was in a side room at Tortham, but of course I wasn't; I
had started out on a journey that very morning! Now fully
awake, I sat up in bed. Opposite me was a window; I was in
an ordinary bed and there was a chair and a little cupboard
in the room, but there was something missing. Then I
realised I was alone! It could not be true. I had not been
alone for years and years. I got out of bed and looked under
it, I looked in the little cupboard; no one was there. I stood
quite still for a few minutes. Was it a trap? Perhaps they
thought I was still asleep. Then I started thinking quickly;
with the glass in the window I could really kill myself, or on
the other hand I could tear up the sheets and choke myself.
The window was the best hope. I walked straight across to it
and with one smash of my hand I broke it; the glass scattered
in all directions. Bending quickly I scooped some up,
ignoring the blood which was pouring from my hands. All I
had to do now was to cut my throat. So engrossed had I been
in my work that I had not heard the rush of footsteps and
the door burst open. Hands quickly seized me.


“My goodness, look at her, stop her. Nurse, Sister, come
quickly!”


I struggled like mad to get away. Why did they always

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Get the glass out of her hands, make her drop it. Why
weren't we told about her? Who admitted her? Ah! That's
got it. Nurse Baron, go and ring Doctor Walters and ask if
we can give her an injection. She will have to be moved.”


They were winning. Another injection. How could I kill
myself if I was asleep? They were prising the glass out of my
hands.


“Leave me alone! Why don't you leave me alone?” I
struggled and squirmed to get away, but in a sudden movement
they swept me off my feet and back on to the bed
where they quickly sat on me; then I heard a telephone
ringing.


“Hold her tight, don't take any chances; I'll just go and
answer the ’phone,” one of them said.


Their combined weight was squashing me flat into the
bed, but still I tried to move; I was panting hard and gradually
becoming aware of the pain in my hands.


“My word! Number 27 is the place for her.”


My mind was perfectly clear. I had to kill myself before
they gave me another injection; I had to. I pulled and
pushed myself around the bed.


“Doctor Walters says give her an injection and get her
moved to Number 27; she will be down in a minute.” And
soon: “Hold on tight while I give it to her.” And soon after
that, “I have just given her an injection, Sister. Doctor
Walters is coming down straight away.”


“Well, this is a fine thing. They have just rung up from
the Front Hall to say that she is extremely suicidal and has
had a special for the last seven years and more. She never
misses a chance. I told them off; I said it's a bit late to tell us
now. That was a near thing, I can tell you; if Nurse Williams
hadn't been outside the door just as she broke the
window she might have cut her neck in two, and who would
have got the blame? Ah, Doctor Walters! This is a fine
thing, isn't it? She was brought along here on a stretcher fast
asleep and without a word of warning; the next thing we

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“All right, Sister, all right! Has she had an injection?
Good. I have rung up 27 to tell them to get a pad ready; we
haven't enough staff to give her a special. I didn't think she
was coming till next week or I would have told them to send
her straight to 27. Directly the hyoscine starts working, we
will take her down to Sister Thomas. I'm afraid she'll always
be down there, she has a terrible record; they wouldn't keep
her at St Denis'. She's been in since she was thirteen and is
getting worse and worse. I can't think how she turned up
today. It was extremely careless of the escort not to tell you
about her.”


Gradually I was becoming sleepy; I bit my lip hard to
keep awake. If I was going to be moved, perhaps I could get
away.


“All right, we will move her now, she seems to be calming
down. We will go straight through with her and we will have
to do something with those hands when she is asleep--hold
her!” This as I gave one terrific jerk and almost got out of
their clutches. But not quite, there were so many of them
and I was so sleepy, so full of hyoscine, fuller than I had ever
been before.


‘I expect that any moment now ...’ I never finished my
thought; I was asleep. The next time I opened my eyes I
smelt the familiar stench of the pads, of rubber that has been
wetted and dirtied and cleaned year after year. Like the one
at the Convent, it was dark green. My hands felt funny; I
lifted them up to look at them and they were covered in pink
stuff. I pulled at it. Immediately the key turned in the lock
and the door swung open and quickly shut again.


“Stop that! You leave those hands alone.” A nurse came
over to me and pushed my hands down. The door opened
and a big fat nurse dressed in grey came in.


“Now what is she up to?”


“Trying to get the plaster off her hands, Sister Thomas.”


“She is, is she? Now listen to me, my girl. Have you ever
been in a straight jacket?”


I jerked my head round in horror to look at her.


“I can see you have. Well, we have one here and if you
try once more to take that plaster off your hands you'll go

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I dropped my eyes and then looked at her again; how
comfortable and cuddly she looked! I thought she might be
nice. Back in the pads again, and I came to the conclusion
that I did not really care. It had been well worth a try with
the window; everything was worth trying, but I never really
expected anything to work now. And in the pads you were
at least alone, no eyes watching you all day and night. But
I decided it was better not to take the dressings off my hands,
for I certainly didn't want to go back into a jacket again,
whatever happened.


“Now you be good, and we shall get on all right. What is
your name?”


“Jane.”


“What's your other name?”


“I haven't got one, I have always been called Jane.”


“Well, I believe in using the ladies' surnames; still, I suppose
I could make an exception for you. Now here comes
supper, sit up and eat it.” Four nurses came in with a tray
on which was an enamel plate and cup and one spoon.


I looked at it, thinking I would stop eating again. After all
I ate at the Convent and they sent me away! Anyway I was
not going to eat that night, although remembering the
numerous tube feeds I had had, I was pretty certain that I
would eat tomorrow, or at any rate egg and milk when they
brought it in. I turned away.


“Well, we've got ourselves some trouble here,” said Sister.
“You can see she's a really old hand, up to all the tricks. Still,
you can't help feeling sorry for her. She has been in for years,
since she was thirteen, and I think she is twenty-three now;
it makes you think, doesn't it? Leave her alone now. I'll go
and find out what is happening to her tonight; perhaps we
can give her another injection. Stay with her, Nurse Brown,
while I go and see. I won't be a moment; she isn't violent so
don't worry.”


In a few minutes she returned with two other nurses. “She
is to have another injection. Doctor Walters says that Nanny
Foster won't be able to manage her alone, so on top of what
she has already had today this should give her a good night.
Hold her tight now whilst I give it to her.” As she gave me

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I certainly slept that night and most of next day. I can
vaguely remember drinking some kind of milk and having
another injection, and off I went to sleep again. I woke up
to hear voices saying: ‘She had better not have any more
hyoscine for the time being. We will put her on to a couple
of nightly draughts. After all, she has slept for nearly three
days now, so that should quieten her down. Her eyes are
open. Jane, are you awake now? I am Doctor Walters. Gome
on now, wake up, wake up!’


I forced my eyes wide open and saw looking at me a tiny
woman who looked like a prune; she had bright little eyes
and her dark skin was a mass of wrinkles. I giggled, I was
suddenly sure she was a monkey, a doctor monkey.


“Don't be stupid, Jane,” she said as I rolled over on to my
side. I felt that I wouldn't mind going to sleep again.


“I read in the case history that she hasn't spoken to anyone
much since entering hospital and it looks as though she
is going to continue that way. I will arrange with Sister
Stuart to collect four nurses and come along about 12.00 pm
to give her the second draught and then Nurse Foster won't
have to worry. We will give her Insulin and ECT tomorrow
and see if it does anything for her.”


I spun round. “You can't give me insulin. I have had it,
and I won't have any more. Doctor Ambrose said I wasn't
to have any more treatment.”


“Be quiet! You will have what you are given.”


“I won't! I won't!” She had gone, but I went on thinking:
‘I won't have treatment, I won't.’ I crept near to the
door, I would run out next time it opened and get away. The
door soon opened and I shot out, only to be dragged back by
Sister Thomas.


“Where do you think you are off to?”


“I won't have treatment, I won't.”


“Drat that woman. Why does she talk in front of them?
This one isn't as silly as they seem to think. Come on, Jane,
you take this draught now. Perhaps you won't get treatment
tomorrow.”


This didn't take me in. I had been deceived too often by
now. I looked up at her and my thoughts were diverted from
the treatment. She looked so comfortable, I felt I would like
to rest my head on her and have a good cry. I decided that I

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Are you awake, dear? I am Sister Stuart and I have
brought you another draught. Drink it up.”


Coughing and spluttering I swallowed it down. After all
those years I still hated the taste and smell of it, and even
then I could feel it dripping off my face as Nurse Evans
threw the remains at me, and I shuddered.


When I awoke it was morning and nurses were coming in.
Before I was properly awake they had stuck a syringe in my
arm and gone. For a while I roamed round the cell. Sister
had told me that there was another cell next to me and when
she had taken me out for a bath the day before I had seen
that I was in a long corridor with many other rooms opening
off it; there were lots of nurses about, so I no longer had the
isolated feeling that I got at the Convent. After a while I
went back and lay down on the mattress, feeling rather
drowsy. Then the door opened and Doctor Walters came in
with an army of nurses, one of them wheeling in a table with
a box on it. Of course! Treatment! I leapt to my feet and
stood in the corner feeling like an animal caught in a trap.


“I am not having it, I am not!”


They overpowered me and laid me flat on the floor, in the
midst of my struggles I felt them placing something on my
head I kicked out wildly ... I opened my eyes, Sister was in
the cell.


“What has happened? Where am I?”


“You have had ECT dear. Now that wasn't bad, was it?”


“It was horrible and I feel sick.”


Twice a week I had that treatment called ECT and I
hated it. First the box was wheeled in, then came the struggle,
and then nothing more until I opened my eyes--an unidentifiable
somebody in an unknown place, someone full of
fear, someone who turned out to be me, confused and aching
everywhere. I hated the feeling of knowing that this was
going to happen and the hours it took afterwards to remember
what was taking place. Even so, it was a great improvement
on my old enemy cardiazol, but I hated all treatment,
including the insulin which I had each day and which made
me feel so queer.

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Day succeeded day. I really disliked Doctor Walters very
much indeed; wizened, impersonal, she was quite incapable
of looking on any patient as a person, only as something that
had to be given treatment, or told not to be stupid, and I
used to feel my back stiffen as she entered the room. On the
other hand I was getting very fond of Sister Thomas and
sometimes I would answer her when she stopped for a chat.
I thought once that she would have made a nice mother, she
was so cuddly. Then one day I turned into a tiger; I roamed
and roared through the jungle; they were trying to shoot me
as I paced through the trees growling at the smaller animals,
stopping now and again to raise my head and listen for
marauders. Then I was myself again, Jane Simpson back in
the pads. I looked around me; there stood Sister and Doctor
Walters. What a relief it was not to be a tiger any more! I
put up my hand to push my hair back from my forehead; it
was wet, matted and sticky. I felt very weak and drowsy.


“Oh, she's round at last! Thank goodness for that. We
won't give her any more treatment. It hasn't done anything
for her, we might as well stop it.”


No more treatment. A deep sigh of relief rose from my
stomach. Doctor Walters went away but Sister stayed in with
me for a bit; she sent for a chair and sat there for quite a
long time. After a while I turned to her and spoke:


“I have been a tiger you know, a wild and horrible tiger
pacing through forests, roaming as if in search of something.”


“I don't know about being a tiger, but you've been in a
coma for almost two days and had us really worried. No
more treatment for you.”


So I settled down in my cell, being taken out only for a
bath. Doctor Walters would come in during the morning,
but I always turned my back on her and she would usually
pass some stupid remark--like ‘Still sulking Jane?’--and
then out she would go.


One day Sister came in to tell me that I had a visitor.


“A visitor?”


“Yes, your brother-in-law has come to see you. You aren't
allowed visitors, but as he is a doctor, you may see him.
Doctor Browne says ...”


“Who is Doctor Browne?”


“The Medical Superintendent. He is going soon. But that
is beside the point. Come on, sit up. I wish he didn't have to

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a few minutes she returned with a tall, thin man who
spoke with a foreign accent: “Hello Jane.”


“I don't know him.” I said to Sister. “That's not Bill. I
liked Bill--he was never afraid of my mother, he made me
laugh once, I laughed so much that the tears ran down my
face. But that's not Bill, I know it isn't. It's a trap.”


“Now Jane, don't talk like that.”


“No, I am not Bill. Mary divorced him some years ago,
then she married me.”


Divorced? What did he mean? How could she marry two
people? Anyhow he made me nervous, standing over me;
also he made me think of Doctor Ambrose.


“Mary asked me to come and see you, Jane; do you
understand what I am saying?”


Another of those who thought I couldn't understand him.


“Why doesn't Nicky come? He promised he would come
back but he never did. He never kept his promise, no one
ever does.”


“You are not allowed visitors Jane. I will ask him to write
to you.”


He stayed for a bit longer, but soon he and Sister went off
and I drifted back to Egypt, where I was a beautiful princess
living in a palace. I spent most of my days now day-dreaming.
A few days later Sister brought a letter in.


“You have got a letter at last Jane, now listen while I read
it to you:


“My darling Jane,


“Karl tells me that he visited you on Tuesday. Believe me I
have tried to come--I have been home for over six months, but
I can't get permission to visit you and I thought you wouldn't
be interested in a letter. I live in a flat now with Tom Green, a
friend I was at Oxford with. Sometimes I see mother, she hasn't
changed. She told me once that she tried to come and see you,
but they wouldn't let her. I bet she made a fuss. I often think
of you Jane, and wish I could help you. Sometimes I wonder
how it all happened and whether it was in some way my fault,

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Nicky.


“Well, Jane, that's interesting isn't it.”


“What's interesting in it?” I suddenly turned on her.
“He's free and I'm locked up. I shall never get out, you know
that, I know it, and I expect Nicky knows it, and I am not
mad. Why don't they believe me? I am not. Oh, if only I
could die! Please give me the letter to keep in here. He sent
me some chocolates once and I kept the box, but after a
while it broke and they threw it away. I wish I could be
thrown away, far, far away.”


I felt tears welling up in my eyes, and for all the rest of
that day I lay dejected and would not eat. I would not go
for my bath either, and I even told my invisible friends who
lived in the pads with me to be quiet. “Oh do be quiet, go
away, leave me alone.” Once more, for days on end, I was
apathetic and miserable, and not even Sister could cheer
me up.


One day the Matron, who used often to pass through the
ward, came in, followed by a strange man.


“What's the patient's name and how long has she been
here?” I heard him ask her.


“Jane Simpson. She has been here a year, in the pads all
the time, sir.”


‘Sir?’ That is what my brothers used to call Uncle Tim. I
looked without much interest at this man; perhaps he was
the thing called Board of Control, and I nearly gasped in
surprise when he came over and sat down on the floor beside
me.


“Good morning, young lady. Can I call you Jane?” He
smiled at me and all I could do was stare back at him. Was
he mad that he should come and sit beside me on the floor?
He talked a little, but I can't remember what he said, only
that he was sitting on the floor beside me. After a while he
got up to go.


“I shall come and see you again tomorrow. Au revoir.”


‘Au revoir.’ I had heard that before. What did it mean?


“You are very quiet, Jane, you haven't moved all day,

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Who was that man who came in this morning?”


“A man this morning? Who can you mean. What did he
look like?”


“I don't know, but he had nice eyes and he sat on the
floor. The Matron brought him in.”


“That was Doctor Grant, the new Medical Superintendent.”


“Oh, no! Medical Superintendents only come round on
Christmas Day and when the Board of Control happens.”


“Well, believe it or not, that's who he was.”


He said he would come again tomorrow, but I didn't believe
that, they never did what they said they would. The
next morning I had almost forgotten him when the key was
turned in the lock and he came in quite alone, and crossing
over he sat on the floor beside me. He stayed a long time and
asked me questions.


“Why don't you answer me? Are you afraid of me? You
understand what I say, I know that.”


“Yes, oh yes, I do. I always understand what people say,
but they don't believe me, they think I am mad, but I am
not, please believe me, I am not mad. I can remember everything
that has happened to me in hospital, but now there is
no hope for me, no hope at all. No one will listen to me.”
What was I saying! Fancy talking to a doctor. I shut up like
a clam.


“Don't stop talking, go on. No? No more to say? Listen to
me. I am going to get you well, Jane.”


“I am not ill.”


“Even so I am going to get you well. I shall come again
tomorrow, try and talk to me then, Jane. Au revoir.”


As the door closed behind him I pondered again on the
words ‘au revoir’. Of course, they meant the same as ‘auf
Wiedersehen’. That day went even more slowly than usual.
I was waiting now for tomorrow. If he came tomorrow perhaps
I could trust him, if he did not, well I had not said
much anyway. The next morning he and Doctor Walters
came in together. I turned over in disgust. What was she
doing here?


“Sit up, Jane, and talk to Doctor Grant.”


I lay with my back to them.

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Perhaps you will finish the round Doctor Walters, while
Jane and I have a chat.”


“You are wasting your time, Doctor Grant; she won't talk
to you. She never talks to anyone, except occasionally to
Sister Thomas.”


“All right, Doctor; I'll see you later.”


My goodness, he had got rid of her. I heard the door shut
firmly behind her. I turned and looked; he was still there.
He came and sat down.


“Well, I know all about you now Jane, from the points
of view of the hospitals you've been in, for I took your file
home last evening and read it.” I probably looked blank, for
he continued: “Your file is a thing that contains all the information
about your days in hospital. You have had some
bad luck, haven't you? Now I want to hear about it from
your side.”


From my side! I should have liked to speak to him, but
so strong was the habit of years that I could not start.


“I think in time you will tell me everything; there is no
hurry. I don't think you should be in the pads any longer. I
will ask Sister to move you to a side room, and when I come
tomorrow I shall have a chair to sit on.” With his usual ‘au
revoir’ he went away.


Later that day I was taken out of the pads and moved to a
side room further down the corridor: the usual thing, bed
chained to the floor, shining key holes, wired-in light and the
shutter across the window, but it was much nicer to lie on a
bed than just a mattress on the floor. I went to sleep earlier
than usual that night. All the time I was awake I felt as
though I was waiting for something to happen. It was almost
as though a tiny seed had started to grow inside me--almost.


The next day, when Doctor Grant arrived, he said: “Now,
I am in no hurry. I shall sit on this chair and I think you
would like to talk to me, but perhaps you are afraid. You
need not be. You see, Jane, I am going to get you out of hospital,
but I cannot do it alone, you must help me. It is no
good saying ‘I am not ill’ and then refusing to eat, or smashing
windows. You must say to yourself; perhaps I wasn't ill
when I came into hospital, but now I am; however, I can
get well and go out again. What is the matter? You look
startled at the idea of going out.”


“I couldn't go out into the world, I wouldn't know what to
do. Look at me! Don't send me away. Oh! why am I saying

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I want you to listen very carefully to what I am going
to say, Jane, and when I have left I want you to go over and
over it. I understand you went into a Convent Mental Home
when you were about thirteen, then a few months later you
went to Stansted House and had treatment. You got much
worse, and then you went to Hasford, where you stayed for
over three years. After this you returned to the Convent for
a further four years, and still your condition was deteriorating.
You then went to St Denis' for a month or two and for
the last year you have been here. Now I have been having a
talk with Sister Thomas--you like her don't you?--and she
tells me that she thinks you know what is going on and that
you have become like you are through circumstances. Now
I am sure you know what is going on, just as I am equally
sure that you have known all the time what has been going
on. Now we come to the point of your not wanting to leave--
that is quite simply explained. Let's add up how long you
have been in hospital--I make it over ten years. At the beginning
you thought of nothing but how to escape, but
gradually you were beaten down and so turned your
thoughts away from escaping alive to escaping through
death. For years you have been fighting alone, Jane; now
you have someone to fight with you, someone who is interested
in you and believes you can get well. It will take a long
time, perhaps three or four years, but one day you will suddenly
become aware of a feeling growing inside you that it
would be best to go out of hospital. However, I must say
again that I cannot do this for you alone, you must do the
biggest share, you must fight for this as hard as you have
fought to kill yourself in these last ten years. Well, what
about it?”


There was a long silence. Could I do it? No, no. Well,
perhaps I could try.


“You mean you don't think I am mad?”


“Indeed, I don't think you are or ever have been. I shall
want to know a lot more about you before I can account for
what has happened, and I think you are going to find it very
difficult to talk, very difficult to trust me, but in time you will

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Moved out of the ward? But I always stay in the same
ward till I leave the hospital and go somewhere else. Why
are some wards better than others?”


“Well, you are going to move to Number 18 tomorrow.
You will be in a dormitory with other people, some of them
your own age. I will tell Doctor Walters that I want you
moved and she will see to it.”


“Won't I see you anymore?”


“Now, Jane! What have I just been telling you? Of
course, you will be seeing me, lots of me, perhaps more than
you want to. Au revoir for now. I shall see you in Number
18.”


“Please tell me something.”


“What do you want to know?” He was just going through
the door, but he turned back.


“Why do you always say ‘au revoir’ when you are leaving
the room.”


He laughed: “Gome to think of it, I don't know; just a
habit I suppose.” And still laughing he left the room.


Next morning Sister Thomas came in, “Well, Jane love,
you are going down to Number 18. I'm pleased. Though
strangely enough I think I shall miss you. You're a funny
creature, you hardly ever talk to me, but I still think I shall
miss you.”


“I wish you were coming too,” I said shyly. “I know I
shall miss you. I love you.”


“Go away with you now. What a thing to say!” But she
looked very pleased. “Now let's wrap this blanket round you
and off we'll go.”


How exciting it was, and no escort either, just me and
Sister. We went through a large long room, then Sister unlocked
a door and we passed into a place that had rows and
rows of chairs in it.


“That's the cinema. I expect you will be able to come
here now.”


Cinema? How strange! I shrugged my shoulders. Then
we arrived at Number 18. I was taken into a dormitory with
about ten beds in it, and told to get into the only empty one.
It had sheets and blankets and real pillows. Next to it was
a small cupboard.

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Goodbye, Jane. Be good. I shall see you from time to
time.”


“Goodbye Sister, please come and see me.”


I spent that day gaping at the other people in the room.
They were quite young, and as I listened to them talking to
each other I gathered that, though they were in hospital
now, they only looked on it as a temporary thing. Some of
them were up and dressed, but a few were in bed like me. I
was wearing a white hospital nightdress instead of the ticking
one, but I saw that some of them were wearing very
pretty things. The Ward Sister--I learned later that her
name was Webb--came over and spoke to me.


“It's a long time since you were here Jane. I don't suppose
you remember it. Now you are going to stay in bed for a day
or two and then you will get up for a while each day and get
dressed, and very soon Doctor Grant wants you to be moved
to Number 6. That's the best ward in the hospital.”


I, listened carefully to what she was saying; I didn't remember
having been here before.


After a while Doctor Walters came in; she talked for a few
minutes to the different people and then she came up to me.


“Now don't do anything silly will you, Jane?”


‘What a horrible thing to say’, I thought, ignoring her as
usual. She turned to the Sister.


“I think it is a great mistake. What good will it do her?
Still you can't argue with Superintendents, they always
know best.”


I was silent, but my thoughts were angry; ‘I'll show you
monkey doctor, you monkey, you wait! I'll show you, you
wait till I leave ...’ Leave? Why, I too was thinking of
leaving!


Sister brought me some medicine a little later, and after
taking it I fell asleep. Soon after waking Doctor Grant came
in.


“Well Jane, do you like it?” I nodded. “Have you met any
of the other patients yet?”


I shook my head. He took no notice of the fact that I did
not speak, but turned round and called to a nurse by the
door, asking her to get Sarah.


“What do you think about all day as you lie there, Jane?”


“I was thinking about the windows not being covered with
shutters. Sometimes when I think about Hasford ...”


“Tell me about Hasford.”

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I shook my head.


“Well, here come Sarah. Come and meet Jane, Sarah.”


A girl with a shock of fair hair came up to the bed.
“Hullo,” she said. I stared back at her, petrified with shyness.
I could not talk to her, I did not know her. “I've heard about
you and I'm glad you've come here. I'll tell you about the
others.” She turned to Doctor Grant: “Can I come and see
you today?”


“Let me look at my little black book to see if I have any
spare time. Yes, I'll see you at 5.30 pm and please don't be
late.”


Fancy her going to see him. Usually the doctors came to
the patients. Off he went, and Sarah sat down on the chair.


“You know, I'm glad you've come, it will be nice to have
someone else to talk to. In the bed next to you there is a Mrs
Jeans--she threw herself under a tube train because she
didn't want another baby, but she didn't get hurt. That bed
over there is occupied by Sally James--she goes out into the
highways and byways looking for men, she's a real one and
no mistake. Then I sleep in that bed. In the next one is Julia
Green--she's a bit odd. And the others are all old. Tell me
about yourself.”


I just gaped at her.


“Go on--how long have you been in hospital?”


“About ten years, I think.”


“Do you like Doctor Walters?”


“No,” I answered without hesitation, and bit by bit she got
me to talk, until after a few days I would say something to
her before she spoke to me.


How persistent she was! She would sit for hours on end,
telling me about herself and asking me about myself. I could
not think why she was so interested. Then one day there was
no visit from Doctor Grant--where was he? I had not really
spoken to him much since that day in the side room. Perhaps
he felt I was not trying and had given me up. When the
Matron did her round, she spoke to Sarah:


“You and Miss Simpson are to go to Number 3 tomorrow.
Doctor Grant left orders that at the first vacancies you two
were to go there. Two patients are going home tomorrow.”


Miss Simpson! How strange it sounded!


“That means we shall be going soon, Jane. I hope to leave
at the end of the month.”


At the end of the month! But I couldn't, I couldn't. All

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I woke next day to find myself back in the pads with my
wrist strapped up. Sister Thomas was in the cell with me.


“Oh, Jane, how could you? Just when you were getting on
so well.”


“What did I do? Why am I here? What has happened to
my wrist?”


“You smashed a window in the ward, and you slashed
some of the glass across your wrist. There was only one night
nurse and she couldn't stop you, but one of the patients went
to get help. Doctor Walters is looking very pleased this
morning: she came and put three stitches into your wrist
last night. Oh, Jane, why did you do it?”


“But I didn't! Well, I suppose I must have, but I didn't
mean to, honestly I didn't. I remember now being told that
I was going to another ward today and that I would soon be
going home. I was terribly worried. How could I go home
at the end of the month? I have no home. And Doctor Grant
doesn't come and see me any more.”


“Poor Jane! Well I believe you, but there is no question
of your going home at the end of the month. It will take
years before you are well enough and Doctor Grant hasn't
been to see you because he is away. He'll be back in three
days, but I think he will be very disappointed. Now I want
you to drink up this egg and milk and then you are going to
have an injection and a good night's sleep.”


The next three days were very bleak. When Doctor Walters
came in she shook her head and turned to the Matron.


“Silly thing to have moved her, very upsetting for the
others.”


“Shut up,” I snapped at her. I don't know which of us was
the more surprised. She left the room, banging the door
behind her.


One morning the door opened to admit Doctor Grant.
“Well well, Jane, what happened to you?”


“I'm sorry, really I am; I didn't mean to do it; in fact, I
can't remember doing it. Please don't be cross. It was Sarah
saying that I'd soon be leaving.”


“Sarah doesn't know what she is talking about. Perhaps I
should have waited till I came back before having you

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I laughed.


“Why are you laughing?”


“Of course there are locks, there are always locks on
doors.”


“Fetch her a dressing gown, Sister. I'll take her along and
then she can see for herself.”


Off we set, through the place with rows and rows of
chairs, down a long polished corridor with lovely flowers in
big pots, and then into another corridor with the door standing
wide open.


“Well, do you believe me now? Here's Sister Shaw. This
is Jane Simpson, Sister. You have a spare room, haven't
you?”


“Yes, sir.”


“Well, come on, Jane. I've got time to have a talk with
you and I had better look at your wrist.” He took the strapping
off. “That's a nasty cut; we'll leave the stitches in for a
few more days. I think you had better finish off today in bed.
Then after breakfast each day you can get up.” While he
was talking I had got into bed and lying down I gazed at
him as he talked. This man is going to get me well. I am sure
he is I thought; if only I could talk to him. After he had gone
the door opened again and in came Sarah.


“Well, I'm glad to see you. I thought you had had it after
the other night. I'm going next week, but I heard them say
that you may be here for another two or three years yet.
Don't you mind?”


Did I mind? No. Strangely enough, I really had no desire
to leave. If I could stay here and have my mind put to rest,
I should be quite happy. What did I mean by that? Sarah
went on talking, but I had no idea what she was saying, for
I was engrossed in trying to work out what happiness meant.
Two days later Sarah came bursting into my room:


“Jane, I have just seen your file in Sister's office, and you
are going to have a leucotomy. Doctor Walters has written
to your mother to ask permission and she has consented.”

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Leucotomy! Pictures of patients with shaved heads passed
rapidly before my eyes. I remembered what Sarah had told
me about this operation.


“No, they can't do that. They shave your hair and cut
your head. I mustn't have it, Sarah, I mustn't have it! I had
forgotten about Doctor Grant and knew that if Doctor Walters
said I was to have it I didn't stand much chance. “What
can I do?”


“Haven't you got a brother?” Sarah asked.


“Yes. I have two. Why?”


“Do you know their phone numbers?”


“No.”


“Do you know their addresses?”


“I know Nicky's address.”


“Well, give it to me and I'll get through to him on the
phone and see if he can stop it. Come on; you are allowed to
go through to the Hall, and there's a telephone there.”


I searched for the letter which Sister Thomas had put into
an envelope for me and followed Sarah through to the front,
staring round me while she worked the phone. I could hear
her asking for Mr Simpson. That was grandpa. But grandpa
was dead. Of course, it was Nicky.


“Jane. Come on, Jane, and speak to him. I have told him
about the operation, but he doesn't seem to know what is
going on. You speak to him. Hold it this way,” and she
pushed me into the phone box and waited outside.


“Jane,” a voice was saying. “Jane, is that really you?
How did you get to a phone?”


“Nicky, they are going to shave my hair and cut my head.
Stop them, please stop them. I'm getting well, but I shall
never, never get well if they operate on me. Please, please
stop them.”


“Jane, try and keep calm and tell me slowly what is happening.
How have you got so well that you can come to the
phone?”


And then for the first time since Sarah told me about the
operation I remembered Doctor Grant. “There is a doctor
here, a new doctor who says that he will get me well so that
I can leave. I don't know if I want to leave, but I do want to
get well--actually I am not ill.” I still persisted in refusing
to admit to anyone that I was anything except quite well.


“Nicky, please stop them shaving my head.”


“It's about half-past two now. I'll get the next train down

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Doctor Grant.”


“Listen to me, Jane. Don't do anything silly; wait for me
to get to you, and I'll be as quick as I can.” How queer it
was to hear his voice again. “Goodbye for now, Jane, I won't
be very long.”


Nicky was coming. I stood there, stupidly holding the
piece of the telephone I had been talking into, not knowing
what to do with it. Sarah poked her head round the door
and took it out of my hand.


“Come on back to your room and then you can tell me
what happened.”


We went back and, sitting on my bed, I told her Nicky
was coming. I wished she would go away so that I could
have some peace in which to think, and then I felt mean, for
after all if it had not been for Sarah I would never have
known about the operation or been able to get Nicky. It
seemed miraculously soon when Sister came into my room
and spoke to me.


“There is a gentleman to see you, Jane. He is your brother.
I haven't got any permission for you to see visitors. I can't
get hold of Doctor Walters and Doctor Grant is at a meeting.
And your brother is so insistent about seeing you that I am
going to take a chance. I'll bring him through.”


And there he was, this time wearing ordinary clothes, but
still with a beard, and I smiled as I saw him.


“Jane, you are better, you smiled at me. And you are in
a proper room. What's all this about an operation? Sister
tells me that Doctor Walters is off today, and that Doctor
Grant is at a meeting, so I can't ask them. Tell me everything
you know.”


I told him what Sarah had told me. “I hate Doctor Walters,
and I won't have the operation, I won't.”


“But Jane, what does Doctor Grant say about it?”


“I don't know, but if Doctor Walters says I have to have
it I shall have it. Mother has signed a paper to say I can
have it. Please, please stop them.”


“I'll stop them. I must go now. I'll ring up Karl and get
him to come with me and we'll meet mother tonight. Now
don't do anything till I get back. I'll be here again tomorrow,
you must believe me. I'm now going to make an appointment

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In spite of my two draughts I did not sleep that night; I
tossed and turned but sleep would not come. Would Nicky
truly come back or was he going to let me down. He had
said that one day we would play cricket again, and for a
while my thoughts drifted back to my childhood and--
inevitably--to my grandfather, and I wondered what my
life would have been like if he had lived.


Early next morning I heard footsteps coming down the
corridor. I was still in bed with my breakfast untouched.
The door opened and in came Doctor Grant and Nicky. I
sat up.


“Now, Jane, what were you up to yesterday? I am going
to leave your brother to talk to you and then I shall come in
later in the day and we'll have a long chat together. Au
revoir.” He shook hands with Nicky and left the room.


“My word, Jane, I've been working hard since I saw you
yesterday.” He sank down on the bed. “Karl and I took
mother out to dinner last night. She made the most terrible
scene in the restaurant, I thought we would be thrown out;
but we kept on and on, and at last she said furiously she
didn't want any more to do with you, I could be responsible
for you and good luck to me. Karl was very clever, he made
her sign a paper relinquishing her authority over you, and
so here I am. But I have even more news for you. I've seen
Doctor Grant and asked him to take you on as his patient.
He has promised to do this, so that means you won't have
to worry any more about Doctor Walters. There will be no
more treatment, Jane; no operations. Trust Doctor Grant,
he'll get you well and one day you'll want to leave here.
There will be no question of going back to mother, everything
will be all right. I must go now, back to the office, but
I have left a message with my secretary that if you ring up
she is to find me, and if I am not there she is to take a message.
Here is the number. I'll be down again next week.
Goodbye for now.”


I saw Doctor Grant every day after that for about an hour,
except on Sundays, but still he did most of the talking; try
as I would I could not say what I wanted to. Sarah left, and
I was not very sorry to see her go, for she talked too much.

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the day she went I spent much time wondering why I
did not mind that I was left behind, why I no longer wanted
to leave. There was a sofa just outside my room and as soon
as I got up I would sit on it for the rest of the day, doing
nothing but thinking and thinking and suffering from a most
overwhelming feeling of guilt.


How could I hate my mother? People did not hate their
mother. How my conscience troubled me! For hours I
would sit silently crying, wallowing in self-pity, and as far as
I could see not progressing at all. I seemed to have come to a
full stop. I no longer contemplated killing myself; that was
over. Sometimes the Sister or nurses would come and sit
beside me and chat, trying to interest me in clothes, but I
wanted only to be left alone.


One day, while I was sitting there, a young woman came
down the corridor; I noticed her first because she had such
a loud voice and was talking rapidly to Sister Shaw. She
stopped when she saw me.


“Hullo! My name is Bennett, what's yours?”


“Jane.”


“I have come from the most horrible hospital in Hasford:
Why, what's the matter? Do you know it?”


And then for hours and hours we talked about Hasford.
She had been on Ward 11, as I had. She told me the most
staggering piece of news.


“Was Nurse Evans there with you?”


“Indeed she was.”


“Well, there was a patient there called Anita------.”


“Yes, I remember her.”


“Well, one day she attacked Nurse Evans; she got her
hands round her throat and there was only one other nurse
there to help. She couldn't get her away and Anita hung on
until Evans was dead.”


“What happened to Anita?”


“I don't know. She was taken away, but it served Evans
right, she was always beating the patients up. Did she beat
you?”


Somehow I could not tell her of all the humiliations
which Nurse Evans had piled on me--she was dead, that
was enough. Just then Doctor Walters walked through the
ward and I remembered how I had once told Sister Thomas
how cruel they were at Hasford and she had repeated it to
Doctor Walters in front of me.

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Really Sister, fancy believing what she says,” was Doctor
Walters' only comment. So I called out to her:


“Doctor Walters, do you remember me telling Sister about
Hasford and you wouldn't believe it? Well, ask Miss Bennett,
she's been there.”


She snarled at me like a bad-tempered spaniel and advised
me to find something better to do than discuss the past, and
marched on. The next day she came up to me and said that
my room was wanted; I was to be moved to Number 12,
which I had heard was only a little better than Number 27.


“You can't move me; I am Doctor Grant's patient.”


She took no notice, but walked off. It says a lot for my
improvement that for once I kept my head. I was allowed
ground parole by now, but hardly ever took advantage of it,
except when Nicky came down; now I walked calmly
through the hall. I knew where Doctor Grant lived, so I
walked out of the front door, down the drive, through the
gates and across the field to his garden gate, and then straight
to his front door. I rang the bell; such trust had I placed in
him now that I knew he would not let her move me. A lady
answered the door and looked at me enquiringly.


“I want to stay here till Doctor Grant comes home, may
I?”


“I am Mrs Grant. Come in dear and tell me what is the
matter. What is your name?”


“Jane.”


“Oh, so you are Jane. I have heard about you. Now tell
me all about it.” She listened to my complete story in silence
before speaking. “I think we had better go back, but I'll see
Doctor Grant and explain to him. You'll be all right, don't
worry.”


So back we went to the hospital to find, by happiest coincidence,
Doctor Grant and Doctor Walters standing on the
front steps. Mrs Grant handed me over, and before she went
startled me and probably both doctors as well:


“May Jane come and have tea with me tomorrow?”


“Certainly she may, if she will,” said Doctor Grant. “Will
you Jane?”


I thought for a moment, then blushing rather shyly I
said: “Yes please.”


“Good, I shall look forward to seeing you tomorrow then.”


“Ah, Jane,” said Doctor Walters. “We were wondering
what had happened to you, you are not going to Number 12

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Doctor Grant took me into his office; it was the first time I
had been in there, for until then he had always come to me.


“Sit down, Jane,” he said. “You have been in Number 3
for a year now and you have done nothing but sit on the
sofa all day, apart from the time you have spent with me,
and then you won't talk. Do you remember that right at the
beginning I told you that the hardest part of the battle would
be yours? Now I am going to make you take an interest in
things. Tomorrow you start going along to occupational
therapy or I am going to put you in a closed ward and not
bother to help you any more. Which is it to be?”


I looked round the room, everywhere in fact but at him.


“You can't have your bun and eat it, Jane. Which is it to
be?”


“Occupational therapy.”


“Good girl. We'll keep on battling. I want you to tell me
about your mother, Jane. I only know what your brother
has told me, and I want you to tell me.”


“I can't, oh, I can't, you see I ...” I had almost told him
I hated her, but somehow I could not get it out. If only I
could talk to him.


Next day a tall woman, whom I had often seen walking
through the ward dressed in a green overall, approached me.


“You are Jane Simpson, aren't you?”


I nodded my head.


“Doctor Grant says that you are to start in the OT room
this morning. Come along now dear, let's go and find something
nice to do.”


How I hated it! Day after day of making scarves, cutting
wool for rugs, trying to weave, and all the time being pushed
and pushed. Why could they not leave me alone? I cannot
describe the tall Miss Adams very well; she was the senior
occupational therapist, but never had anyone such a capacity
for getting on one's nerves. She was big boned, had a mass of
curly hair and a harsh and affected voice. She never gave
me a chance to go to the place on my own, but every morning
would come for me, speaking in a sweetly offensive way
which she kept for all the patients. I remember hearing someone
say to his child as a blind man passed: “But for the
Grace of God there go I,” and I longed to say to Miss
Adams: ‘Why don't you think that one day you may be in

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Under great pressure I made a work bag, but when it was
finished I suddenly realised that it was good and attractive.
I got some paper from Sister Shaw and, wrapping it up, I
went down the drive and across to Doctor Grant's house and
rang the bell. I had not been there since the afternoon I
went to tea when I had sat completely silent listening to
Mrs Grant talk; I had on that occasion not a thought in my
head except the absence of one, yet I had been strangely
happy. It had been so long since I had been out to tea. Mrs
Grant opened the door:


“Jane, have you come to tea?”


“No, thank you. I have come to bring you this.” I handed
over the hated work bag, so stuffed with hate and pride. It
was a thrill to be able to give people things again.


“Oh, but it's lovely, how kind of you! Are you going to
the whist drive tonight?”


“I don't want to. I can't play whist.”


“Do come, I'll be there and I'll show you what to do.”


I smiled at her and went away. As it turned out I had no
choice, for Miss Adams turned up and collected me and two
other patients.


“I can't play.”


“It doesn't matter, you will soon learn.”


The whist drive was held in the library. There were quite
a lot of people there, including the Matron, looking so funny
when she sucked her lip in, and Miss Jones, the Deputy
Matron, who I thought was rather nice: Doctor and Mrs
Grant and about twenty patients, men and women, in all.
Miss Adams took me across to an empty place at one of the
tables.


“Sit here, Jane, and you move round each game.”


Someone dealt the cards and the others at my table
picked their's up. I just looked at mine; what should I do
with them?


“Your lead,” said the man sitting opposite me.


“What do you mean?”


“Look at your cards and play one.”


“But I can't play. I have never played before.”


“Well, fancy sticking you here.”


For a moment I felt as though I was back at school, being

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Where are you going, Jane?”


It was Doctor Grant. I could feel myself blushing. Oh
dear, would I get into trouble?


“I can't play, it's not fair just to sit me down and expect
me to know what to do.”


“Come on now, don't worry. You come and sit at our
table and we will ask Miss Jones to sit in your seat, then
Mrs Grant and I can show you what to do. You mustn't run
away just because you can't do things.” The evening passed
and I have played since, but I am not a card player.


I played hockey on Wednesday afternoons. I thought
sometimes of cracking Miss Adams on the shins with my
hockey stick, but violence did not really appeal to me. Under
great pressure from Miss Adams I half-heartedly dusted the
ward.


“I want Jane to dust the ward each day, Sister.”


The little Sister's back stiffened and she bristled all over:
“I don't know about that, Miss Adams. She's paying eleven
guineas a week for a private room. I don't know what the
brother will say if we make her work.”


“Please try, Sister.”


So I trailed about with a duster in one hand for a day
or two, but that soon faded out. Nevertheless I battled on.


I had been on Number 3 for over two years, yet I still had
no desire to go, and had not really talked to Doctor Grant.
Then at last I began to feel a slight interest in other people.
The Deputy Matron came to me one day.


“Gome and have a cup of tea in my sitting-room, Jane.
Don't blush like that. Come on.” She led the way and chatted
about the outside world as though I knew all about it. Perhaps
I was not such poor company as I thought, for often
after that she would come along to the ward just before
teatime to collect me. I had learnt by now the meaning of
the strange words ‘Board of Control’, and when I went to
tea with her one day I told her, rather hesitantly, that I had
thought it some kind of THING when I had first heard of
it. She laughed, and that pleased me. Sometimes I would not
talk to her at all, but just sit by the fire warming myself for
I always felt cold, and she never bothered me to talk. It was

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“South Africa? Where is that?” I had asked her.


“Thousands of miles away, Jane.” Faint memories stirred
as I realised that there were other places than those immediately
around one.


About this time I had a slight relapse and one day refused
to go to occupational therapy.


“I am not coming. Go away and leave me alone,” I told
Miss Adams when she came to fetch me.


She went straight to tell Doctor Grant, who soon came
striding down the passage.


“Why aren't you at OT, Jane?”


“I am not going any more. I am not ill,” I shouted at him.
“It's only for people who are ill. I am well.”


“You are not well and you never will be if you don't talk
to me and tell me what's troubling you,” he shouted back
and, turning on his heel, strode away.


I watched him go and it seemed as if my chance of recovery
was going with him. I quickly got off the sofa and went
through to his office. He was just going to close the door as
I slipped in.


“Well, Jane?”


Floods of tears burst from me and seemed to release my
tongue, I talked and talked. I told him about my miserable
childhood, how I hated my mother. “I hate, hate, hate her.
She has done this to me. She wouldn't leave me with grandpa.
But I shouldn't hate my mother, and my conscience
pricks me all day.” I told him about the cardiazol, about the
beatings, and the humiliations of Hasford, about the padded
cell and the straight-jacket at the Convent. On and on I
went. I must have talked for two or more hours and he never
once tried to stop me. When at last I had finished I felt
exhausted and yet relieved, as though a great load had been
lifted off my shoulders. I sat there quietly crying and hardly
able to think.


“Come on Jane. I think you had better have an injection
and get some good sleep. Everything will be all right now.
Tomorrow we will get to work and start clearing up your
problems.”


We went to my room and he gave me an injection and
sat with me till I slept. From that day I never looked back.


Next morning he came along to see me. “You talked to

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When he left me I knew that I would be all right and that
I would leave, although I was as frightened as excited, now
that I was actually allowed to go out alone. I walked down
the drive immediately after breakfast the next day, which
was a Tuesday. I walked down to the main gates and fully
intended to go straight through them, but as I drew nearer
thoughts of the Convent and the House flashed through my
mind--was this a trap--what would I do when I got outside?
By this time I had reached the gates and I took a step
out and drew back as a car passed by, and there I stood all
the morning, half in and half out, asking myself should I
go or should I stay. At last I heard the lunch bell ringing and
I returned to the ward bitterly disappointed at the morning's
failure.


All that afternoon, while occupied with OT, I pondered
on my failure, wondering what I was frightened of; tomorrow
I would go out no matter what happened. The next
morning, immediately after breakfast, I again headed for the
gate. I walked straight there, but when I reached it I stood
lost and hesitant. I simply did not know what to do when I
got out. Nurses walked past me, other patients went in and
out, and then I saw Doctor Walters coming and without

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A very pretty girl walked by and as she passed me she
looked me up and down and raised her eyebrows as she
looked at my clothes. A horrible feeling came over me; I
could feel my heart beating and was suddenly tired. What
was wrong with me? I was very conscious now of my clothes.
I couldn't remember when I got them but I suppose they
were the ones the nuns had bought for me years ago--
clothes had never worried me before, you just put on what
was there and that was that. The rest of the morning was
spoilt. I returned to the hospital disconsolately kicking my
feet along instead of lifting them, and the habit was accentuated
when I was moody.


In the afternoon I saw Doctor Grant and he wanted to
know what I had been doing. I told him about the shops and
the trains, although now it seemed rather childish, and then,
opening and shutting my mouth two or three times, I
eventually asked him what was wrong with my clothes.


“Why do you ask?”


Rather shamefacedly I told him about the girl and the
way she had looked at them.


“Well, Jane, they are a bit old you know. Did you look at
yourself in the mirror this morning, or in fact at all lately?”


I hadn't, I was still scared of what the mirror would show.


“Come and look in this one. Come on, it won't eat you.”

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I nervously advanced towards it and, half shutting my
eyes, I looked at myself. There I stood in a worn and shabby
brown skirt, an unbecoming green jersey, thick lyle stockings
and down-at-heel laced-up shoes. Then I raised my eyes to
my face. This time I did not see an animal looking back at
me; I saw instead a rather pale-faced young woman with
dark, curly hair and large staring eyes. I stood staring for
some time and then turned impulsively to Doctor Grant.


“My face is better, isn't it?”


“You look quite a different person, don't you, Jane?”


“Yes, I think I do. How do I get new clothes?”


“You buy them in a shop.” He laughed. “Go up to London
tomorrow and get some.”


“Don't be silly. You have to have money to buy anything
and I haven't got any.” Tears came slowly to my eyes. How
terrible my clothes were! Doctor Grant's voice broke into
my thoughts.


“I am going to telephone Nicky and ask him to meet you
at Waterloo tomorrow. I shall put you on the 9.55. Go to
the shops, buy yourself what you like, be back at 7.00 pm
and come and show me what you have bought.”


“I don't know where the shops are.” I stared at him in
horror. “I couldn't possibly go; everyone will laugh at me
and talk about me.”


“Now look here Jane. Sooner or later you will have to get
out and about. I am going to get through to Nicky straight
away--Hallo! Could I speak to Mister Simpson, please--
Doctor Grant--good morning. No, nothing's wrong. I am
sending Jane up on the 9.55 tomorrow morning to buy some
clothes. Can you manage to meet her at Waterloo and go
with her--What do you want me to do about the money?
Will you pay or shall I give her some money and put it down
on the bill--Good, good. Goodbye.” He hung up the receiver.
“Now you need have no worries at all. I know it is a
big step, but you have to take it and you'll feel much better
when you've done so. Nicky will pay for everything. But he
wants us to give you a few pounds; he says he should have
thought of it before, and for that matter, so should we.”


I left him and wandered back to the ward, unable to take
it all in. “I am going to London tomorrow,” I said to Sister
Shaw and then I laughed and for no reason at all said:
“Turn again Whittington, Lord Mayor of London.”


Sister smiled and told me to go to bed in good time. I was

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Hello, Jane, you are up early!”


“I am going to London, have you forgotten?”


“Indeed I haven't, but this is much too early. Have you a
handbag?”


“No.”


“Well come along with me and we will get Sister to lend
you one.”


Eventually we left for the station. I was in a complete
dream, and before I came to myself I was on the train and
it was off. Doctor Grant had told me to be sure to get off at
Waterloo. I tumbled out of the train, feeling a bit bewildered,
and there was Nicky running towards me. Smiling
happily he took my hand and we made our way out of the
station.


“My word, Jane, it is good to see you. Let's go and buy
you some clothes, then we will have lunch and go to a
cinema. I should have thought about the clothes before, but
you know what men are.”


I was troubled in the shops. I didn't know what I wanted
and just stared at the woman who asked me. However, she
must have realised that something was wrong, because she
practically bought the clothes for me and then showed me
the mirror. I thought I looked very nice. We left the old
ones behind and went on to a shoe shop. The girl there was
quite different and looked unpleasantly at my old shoes. I
began to get more and more self-conscious, but I realised
that if I wanted to come and live in this beautiful world I
would have to get used to this kind of thing. I was bound to
make many mistakes and would have to bluff my way
through many situations. I could do it and I would. I turned
to the girl:


“I will have the black ones.”


Laughing happily, we strolled out of the shop. What a
lovely day that was, a memory of delightful confusion. We
went to a large restaurant for lunch and I don't remember
what I ate for there was too much to take in. The best thing
was to be sitting at a table with Nicky after all these years.

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Here, you have left this behind.”


“That's for the waitress, Jane; that's the tip.” And he
replaced it on the table.


Tip? Whatever was that. Then we went to a cinema. It
was a musical film and, while we watched quietly, I began
to sense how out of touch I was going to be. I could not
dance, I had never been out with a man, let alone been
kissed like the girls in the film were being kissed. Also I felt
dull beside all the other smart people; but instead of dissolving
into tears, as I would have done until quite recently,
I decided to add all these things to my list of what I must
learn to do. We just had time for tea before I had to catch
my train back, and we strolled through Piccadilly Circus
while the traffic roared by. High up in the sky aeroplanes
were buzzing and the streets were packed with men and
women. The shop windows dazzled me, for I had never seen
such beautiful clothes; and there was I, Jane Simpson, who
everyone had counted as a hopeless lunatic, back in circulation,
and suddenly I was glad I was alive. This was life, the
hum of traffic, the cry of the flower girl, the shouts of newspaper
men.


“I am well again now, Nicky. It will still be some time I
think before I can face this on my own, but when the time
comes I shall, and I shall never, never go back again.”


We laughed and talked on the way back to Waterloo and,
as Nicky put me on the train, he drew out from his pocket
a little parcel.


“Here you are Jane. I am sorry for everything.”


The train left before I could ask him what he meant. I
undid the parcel, and inside was a watch. I put it on my
wrist and it looked nice. When I got back to the hospital I
went into Doctor Grant's office and turned slowly round
whilst he looked at me.


“Well, that's more like it. You do look smart! You bought
a watch too.”


“No, Nicky gave it to me.” I thought for a time and then
I said. “I got something else today.”


“Did you? What was that?”


“A realisation that when I do leave here things aren't
going to be easy. I shall have to make up stories to cover all
the time I have been in hospital. I know nothing of life. But

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I slept very soundly that night, after my second draught.


Each week Nicky came down to see me, and then one day
he brought his future wife down. I was very nervous in case
she thought me mad and was scared of me, but we became
friends straightaway and started planning what to do when
I left. When I left! How strange it sounded! There were
many months of hard work left to do. First I had to learn to
do without my sleeping draughts--this was very, very difficult,
but I succeeded. I must smarten myself up, powder my
nose, and tidy my hair, and all these things I eventually
learned to do. My hatred towards my mother, which had
been fed by my guilt, was slowly dying; she was becoming
a thing of the past. I decided that I would never intentionally
see her again.


One day Doctor Grant asked me what I intended to do
when I left, how was I going to earn my living. I thought
for a moment and then told him I had no idea what I could
do. Carefully he went over various jobs, but they all needed
either some kind of training or an examination called GCE.
I had neither of these. We gazed at one another in some
perplexity.


“Do you think you could go to a private coach and learn
enough to get your GGE? There is no hurry, you could
sleep here and go and learn in the daytime.”


I asked him what you had to do to be able to pass this
examination.


“Well, I expect you will need French, English, Latin ...”


I stopped him before he went any further and shook my
head. “No good. It would take me sixty or seventy years to
learn enough.”


Once more we started thinking of things I might be able
to do.


“What about learning shorthand and typing?”


“I don't think I could do it, I was never able to learn
anything.” Blushing furiously I added that I knew absolutely
nothing except how to read and that I was only just able
to write.

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097985-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Now don't get upset Jane. What about my ringing up
the place in the town and seeing if you can go there for a
week to see if you like it or not?”


I thought for some minutes before replying to this suggestion.


“Will they know I come from here? Because I have decided
that when I go I am not going to tell people where I
have been or else they will all despise me. I know this is so
because Mrs Donaldson, who left last Monday, has come
back and she says that no one will give her a job and that
everybody is scared of her. I couldn't bear that to happen
to me.”


“I shan't tell them where you come from. I shall just ask
if they have a vacancy?”


Doctor Grant rang up the Secretarial College and they
agreed to admit me to a course starting the following Monday.
I went along to the classes rather nervously, but as I
knew I had no need to return if I did not like them, it was
not too bad. I found that once I was started it was quite
easy and after a few weeks I could do enough shorthand to
get a job, provided my employer did not dictate too fast and
provided I did not start day-dreaming in the middle of his
dictation. I should, of course, have stayed until the end of
the course, but I was impatient to be away. So Doctor Grant
helped me to answer an advertisement in the paper for a
shorthand typist at a Clinic and I went for an interview.
How scared I was, yet I got the job. Then I answered another
advertisement for lodgings and arranged that too, and
there was nothing left to do but to settle the date of my
departure. Nicky and his wife, Louisa, were away on their
honeymoon.


“Don't you want to wait till Nicky comes home?” Doctor
Grant asked me.


“No, I'll go now and then I will be settled and used to it
by the time they return.”


The date fixed for my departure was August 16th, 1949.
