BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> What happened last week?  Tell me about it.  Take me through your day.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, [INAUDIBLE].  Well, I woke up Wednesday, and I was supposed to come, and, um, was thinking about it all day.  Even at lunch I made sure, because I wanted to make sure that the attendance la, lady had reference that I was actually supposed to be leaving, um, so that I could get my pink slip.  And then come the end of the day I was get, I just get so sidetracked by my class that I'm in, um, it was sixth period, and I have a study hall that period.  So I go up to my seventh period class, um, and work, work on the stuff that I'd been working in seventh period, sixth period and just continue working through seventh.  Um, well that day, I just kind of got sidetracked and, and working with what I was doing.  Um, and completely forgot about the pink slip in my back pocket.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, so it wasn't until about 3:00 that I realized, "Oh, crap, I was supposed to be somewhere at 2:00."  And so I ran to my car, realized, and checked my phone messages, and [NAME OTHER] had sure called me, I think twice.  [NAME OTHER] had called me twice.  And [NAME OTHER] had even left a message, um, saying, um, "Where are you?  I'm, I'm here.  It's 2:50.  Um, I hope you show up.  I guess you're not."  So, then, um, I, so I ended up, I just went straight home after that because I knew I didn't, that there was no point in going back inside, because I'd be there for another 30 minutes and be leaving anyway.  Um, not to mention it was raining horribly, and I didn't want to run back through the rain.  Um, and so [NAME OTHER] gets home on the normal time, but [NAME OTHER] is normally home before [NAME OTHER], so I figure, "Oh, [NAME OTHER] has just gone out for something."  Well, it's 9:00, it comes around 9:00.  [NAME OTHER] and I have already eaten.  He, [NAME OTHER] and I prepared ourselves dinner.  And, he's still not home.  So we call mom, and she said she'll call him, and then he comes home.  I guess he gets home about 9:30.  Um, and then he proceeds to lay it on thick the punishment I ought to be getting.  I, but the whole time since I'd gotten home, actually from the time I'd even gotten in the car at school, um, I'd been thinking, "Okay.  What kind of punishment would I want, would I, should I get, would I give myself?"  And, I had in mind that I would pay back, which I'm going to, because that's part of the punishment he gave me, I'm going to pay back the $150 that he spent for an appointment that I didn't show up for.
<b>DR:</b> Well he was here for most of it.  We talked.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.  And, um -
<b>DR:</b> It wasn't a waste.
<b>PT:</b> Um, but, and so then, um, he also added that the car was going to be taken away.  And because I had already arranged, um, to meet with one of my friends during lunch the next day, and we were going to go off campus together, uh, my brain kind of just shut down and went into primitive, non reality kind of state.  And, I just got so upset and angry, I just went and had a, um, and so I proceeded to have an episode.  Um, then, um, I storm upstairs, in my room, started yelling, not any words, just yelling random noise [INAUDIBLE], random, I don't know, sounds.  Um, then uh, went into the frog, our room over the garage, and just started trying to call mom to get in touch with them.
<b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> And then my brother came upstairs, and he offered me, offered to, for me, he didn't directly say it was going to be the Klonopin, but, um, he did say, I, "Come downstairs and take the medicine.  It will help you calm down."  Of course, I knew what that was, but I, for some reason, I know I probably should have, but didn't really want to.  So, I just, I kept refusing it.
<b>DR:</b> What happened then?
<b>PT:</b> Um, then I remember hearing [NAME OTHER] yell to [NAME OTHER], "Come on down.  He, he's not going, he's not going, you can't do anything with him."  But [NAME OTHER] was persistent.  He wanted to help me.  Um, and so he kept trying to calm me down.  I ended up, um, punching the ceiling, because the ceiling kind of slanted the way the roofline is.  Um, making a nice, big dent, which I'm going to have to repair.  Um, not because I was told to, but because I feel I need to, um, repair the hole.  Um, and then I sat down on the couch, still trying to call mom, and then I just started crying because I didn't know what to do, because I couldn't get hold of mom.  I just kept saying, "I'm scared.  I'm scared.  I don't know what to do.  I'm scared."  Because I really was scared.  I didn't know what was, what was really going on.  I think it was probably one of the worst episodes I've ever had.  I also remember at some point, because I still can't open my jaw as far as I would like to be able to, but, at some point just bashing in the sides of my temples with my fists.
<b>DR:</b> And you hurt yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  And bruised the, bruised this over there kind of.  But [INAUDIBLE].  Um -
<b>DR:</b> You were pretty angry at yourself.
<b>PT:</b> I was.  Uh, I really don't know if I was angry at myself so much, that I was just angry at the situation.
<b>DR:</b> Well, um, you didn't hit [NAME OTHER].  You beat yourself up.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I was, I was angry at the situation.  And that, I knew hurting somebody else wouldn't solve it.  And so, I know that for some reason, I guess when I, whenever I get into one of those states, I get it into my head that self-inflicted pain is, is a way to relieve stress.  But I know that it's not, in a, in a reality state.  Um, but -
<b>DR:</b> Uh, what is, what does reality state mean?
<b>PT:</b> Like, like I am now.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> Like, thinking rationally.  Like, not freaking out.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I was not.
<b>DR:</b> Well, how, at what point along that journey that day could you have taken a different path, so that you didn't get hurt?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> And [INAUDIBLE] make things worse?
<b>PT:</b> Well I think, um, I could have done something better, to, to better prepare myself in the case I did forget my, the appointment like I did, to remind myself, such as maybe putting a post-it note on my ID or something.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, there are a lot of things you could have done as far as organizing yourself.  And the, that's going to be a big issue for you, [PATIENT NAME], is the organization.  [INAUDIBLE] you're going to be working,  congratulations on your job by the way.  I, [NAME OTHER] told me last week.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, that's awesome.  And it's a real privilege.  I mean, not all scouts get that opportunity.  And then, um, come fall it would be, uh, the college thing.  And the organization is critical.  You won't make it in college if you're not organized.  I guarantee you that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I, I know that I have a lot of, uh, work to do on, as far as my organization.
<b>DR:</b> And you can make it fine, if you're organized.  You really can.  That's the difference between an A student and an F student, is procrastination, organization, going to class.  Just the obvious things.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Still using your Daytimer.  Putting appoint -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Put appointments in there.  Keep your Daytimer with you.  Your mom has got one.  I assume [NAME OTHER] has one.
<b>PT:</b> He does.  [NAME OTHER]'s is his phone, so.
<b>DR:</b> Whatever works for you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> As long as you use it, it's, uh, it can be as cool as and awesome an organizer as there is, but if you don't use it, or have it with you -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's useless.
<b>PT:</b> Well this week I've actually started using my phone to, like, um, to, to keep myself informed of important times.  Such as yesterday, I put in my phone when I had to back from the exemption, the exam that I exempted so I could go off campus.  Um, but I had to be back in time for the class, for classes to start again.  Um, I have done that again today, and I'll probably end up doing it again tomorrow, and also, um, Thursday I think I'm going to, um, I'm going to have to figure out whether I, when I can take the, um, some, the two, um, parts of the asset test again.  Or, one, one I'm going to start taking for the first time, the other I'm going to retake.  Um, I'm going to see when I can do that at, at, mom was trying to get me to do it today, but I didn't want to do it today, because -
<b>DR:</b> What does he have to do again?
<b>PT:</b> Um, the asset?  Um, it's a, it's the placement -
<b>DR:</b> Placement.
<b>PT:</b> Course.  Yeah.  Their entry test.
<b>DR:</b> For math?
<b>PT:</b> For math.
<b>DR:</b> And English.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, and English.
<b>DR:</b> You taking both of them?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I'm taking, well at school, when they offered it, they offered three sections.  No, four, I think.  It was numerical, a numerical test, basic, like you couldn't use a calculator, just simple computations.  Um, the, uh, elementary algebra.  Then, uh, first was creative, or writing sample, and then there was also a reading, um, comprehension section.
<b>DR:</b> But you have taken both already?
<b>PT:</b> I've taken all, all of the, the four that were mentioned.  And the -
<b>DR:</b> Right.  And then, the terms of your results were what?
<b>PT:</b> Um, that I would be able, that I would have to take an English 101 course because of my, my writing sample.  My reading score was through the roof, but my writing sample was not so hot.  Um, but, um, my, then my math, I want to be able to exempt the math that I'm going to have to take for my degree, and so I'm going to go take the intermediate Algebra, which is next, the next section of the Asset.  Um, and I was, I was going to go take, also, I don't know if I said this, two seconds ago, but I was going to take the crea, the writing sample again.
<b>DR:</b> You have tests this week, or are you done?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I'm done.  I was done last week, actually.
<b>DR:</b> You're just putting time in?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> So, the last, you have, what do you have a half day Thursday?
<b>PT:</b> Half day is Thursday, and then Friday.
<b>DR:</b> And then graduation, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Graduation.
<b>DR:</b> What's your mood like this week?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it's actually been a lot more relaxed.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> Got your car back, I assume.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  Um, I'm happy for that.  Um, but I'm trying not to let anything go to my head, because then I know that, if that happens, I'll be right back where I started.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], you're going to make mistakes.  You know, you're going to, disappointments.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How are your relationships with your peers?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well, one of my friends, [NAME OTHER], she, um -
<b>DR:</b> That's the -
<b>PT:</b> Has been on my mind a little too much.
<b>DR:</b> That's the girl you're kind of, uh, keen on, aren't you?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Um, and, um, mom, uh, mom pointed out to me that, that in some sort of way, she actually is kind of simi, somewhat connected to the three episodes I've had this month, matter of fact.  Um, the first one being I was tardy at school, because I wanted to see her.  And the second one, she wasn't paying me enough attention at prom.  And then, the third one, um, then I was going to take her out to lunch.
<b>DR:</b> Didn't work out.  What do you see, uh, in relationships with, uh, your peers, boy and girl relationships?  How, how has th, how have they been, uh, how do you see them working out?
<b>PT:</b> Um, they, some of them look like they're going to last, but not all of them.
<b>DR:</b> I don't know about last, but what's it like for them?  What are their relationships, are they pretty even, pretty stable?
<b>PT:</b> Um, for me, I don't really know, because I haven't had enough to really -
<b>DR:</b> You haven't seen, uh, a lot of drama?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, no not really.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  It's there.  Kids your age, there is a lot of drama in relationships.  So, what are you going to do about her?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'll keep talking to her and see where I go, see where it takes me.
<b>DR:</b> What's she doing next year?
<b>PT:</b> Um, she, what's she doing next year?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> She's, um, going to [DEIDENTIFIED], then she's going to transfer to a college in [DEIDENTIFIED] the following year.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Why isn't she going there as a freshman?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], your medicines are okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Your taking, uh, what do you take in the morning, what medicine?
<b>PT:</b> In the morning I'm taking, um, the Adderall, the Wellbutrin, uh, not the Wellbutrin, the lithium, and then, uh, the vitamin C and the multivitamin.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, at night I take the Wellbutrin, the two lithium, and the two Abilify.
<b>DR:</b> The two Abilify at night?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  No weird thoughts, or?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> What are you most worried about?
<b>PT:</b> Next year.
<b>DR:</b> Are you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You scared about college?
<b>PT:</b> Well, not so much scared, it's just that, anxious.  How to, not really knowing what to expect, so, kind of just maybe just a fear of the unknown.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You haven't signed up for classes, have you?
<b>PT:</b> Nope.  I actually have to call when I get home today, because I'm missing the first exam period, or the, the second period exam, um, right now, um, but the next, the next one, the next exam, which is six period, I have a study hall, so she let me exempt, because it's a study hall.  What are you going to do, sit in there for an hour and a half doing nothing?  I'd rather not.  Um, so I'm going to go home and call the, to I guess the advisor?  My advisor for -
<b>DR:</b> Tech?
<b>PT:</b> Tech.
<b>DR:</b> Your lithium is one in the morning, two at night?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You been healthy?
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> Nice having your brother around?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  It is.
<b>DR:</b> Was he around when you had your, kind of flipped out last week?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He actually, well, um, he was actually one of the one, people that was trying, last week he was trying to calm me down.  He, um, he was trying to get me to take a Klonopin to, um, calm me down.
<b>DR:</b> When some, when you're upset like that and somebody, uh, tells you that you're out of control, it's not a good feeling is it?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Last, kind of last thing you want to hear.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Can, may make it worse.
<b>PT:</b> Well, also the, he wasn't telling me that I was out of control, but, he, he was -
<b>DR:</b> By telling you that you need to take medicine?
<b>PT:</b> Well, he was, he actually was asking me, "Do you want to take this?  Do you," he wasn't, he wasn't trying to force it on me.  He was, he was passively asking, he was remaining calm, asking me, "[PATIENT NAME], you'll lose everything.  Do you want to take this medicine?"  I mean, he had, he had good reason, he had, um, like, uh, not fact, uh reasons, but, um, he, he, when he said I'd lose everything, he was pretty much right.  Um, but uh, I don't, I don't blame him for, for, um, trying, at least.  Because, it's better than what [NAME OTHER] was going to do.  I mean, I know that he was, he was angry at, he knew that I was having an episode, but, I also know that he knew that if he got involved, if, if he tried to, um, to intervene, it probably would not have turned out pretty.
<b>DR:</b> You, [COUGHING], so get yourself organized, using your Daytimer.  When you have conflicts like that, and disagreements, recognizing your emotions kept in yourself.  Go take a nap.  What else could you have done when you started getting upset?  [COUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> Um, well, I tried to go, to go for a run, but I didn't quite make it that far.  I had, I was putting my shoes on to go run, and about half way through it just kind of just overtook me.
<b>DR:</b> Hum.  It'll happen if you wait too long, so kind of keep backing up and recognizing.  Kind of check in with your feelings, where you're at.  And try not to put yourself in situation that are going to not be good.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Check in on yourself.  Start getting upset, be away from people.  Guarantee you, that's going to make it worse.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Get in trouble.  You looking forward to the summer out at [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  I am.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.  What are you looking forward to?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I was looking forward to the people that I'll meet.  Um, because there's going to be a large number.  Because the first week, I, I'll know pretty much everybody that's, that's, um, the first week of actual camp, um, the second, the first actual week of work, the staff would, well meet everybody that I'll be working with the second week of camp.  Um, during the actual event, um, for, for the first and every, week one, three, and four, each have a boat, um, boat, a crew going on the [DEIDENTIFIED], which is where I'm, what I'm going to be doing.  Um, and, so they, um, so every, every week I'll be, um, except for the second one, of course, I'll be out on the water.  Um, as, uh, I know that I'll be meeting a bunch of new people because, I, the third week is the Venture crew, and there will be a leadership training kind of thing, and there are at least 20 people going, which is more than what the boats can hold, so what we're going to do is we're going to have at least spare canoes, and people just paddling in the canoe.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Two-man canoe, uh, and with their gear in the war canoes.
<b>DR:</b> What, uh, what is a war canoe again?
<b>PT:</b> It's a 20 foot, at least a 20-28 foot long canoe that can hold anywhere from, I'd say, um, 15-18 people.
<b>DR:</b> That's a big canoe.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> How many people paddle?
<b>PT:</b> Um, everybody.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> Except, except for, uh, two of them, if, if you, you have the boat full of just people.  Because there's some, two, two of the seating boards only hold three people, so.
<b>DR:</b> Guess they have a rudder on something like that, don't they?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, no, they don't.  No rudder.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, kind of back into it, huh?
<b>PT:</b> You got have a big, motley guy in the back has to be the human rudder.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to have to master that.  Um, because we've gotten, we've gotten that boat, we've gotten it going, um, eight point s, like one, eight point maybe, three or four miles an hour.  Which is pretty fast for a, for a canoe.
<b>DR:</b> That's real fast with that many people in it.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Um, but that was, that was awesome.  We had, we had, um, eight people that, that year.  Um, no it was seven, not it was eight.  Yeah it was eight.  We had eight people in the boat that year.  And we were just whipping it.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> We're going to have the two strong guys in the front, and just kind of like pull on the, and everybody was just catching the bulge water as it was going by them.  So -
<b>DR:</b> It sounds like you're going to have a great summer.
<b>PT:</b> I mean given that we're not a, not a rowing boat that can pull a person skiing behind them, but, we were moving pretty fast.  And sometimes I, I think we'll actually get a chance to troll, um, a fishing line behind us to see if we can catch stuff.  Because we did one year.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Keep busy.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Steering, driving, fishing apparently.  I'm real happy for you, [PATIENT NAME].  You sound like you've got a good attitude about things, and seem to be much more on the right track here.  So, you're going to school today, I guess?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I've got a, um, uh, I don't have any absences, so, can't exactly take the rest of the day off.
<b>DR:</b> Darn.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> How's your driving?
<b>PT:</b> It's good.  Um, I haven't gotten a ticket yet, which I'm surprised.
<b>DR:</b> Hum, yeah.  Why is that?
<b>PT:</b> Because I've noticed that sometimes, I have a tendency to speed when I'm not really paying attention.
