The front porch helped. From there I could
see the three buildings that comprised this boarding
house. The house was in fact three houses, which
altogether took up a third of a city block and three street
numbers. My porch stretched across 1241 and
1243. These had once been semi-detached
houses, but walls had been opened up
between the two, so that they became one
house. A set of stairs led to each entrance-way.
Immediately adjacent was the
corner house, 1245, whose ground floor
was taken up by the kitchen and dining room.
To get to my porch retreat, I had to walk past
an office on the first floor. It was easy to peek in
the mostly glass door, but I had yet to see
anyone actually sitting behind the
old-style office desk. It was as sparsely
furnished as the few bedrooms I had seen:
the owner's chair was behind the desk, and a

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I spent whole afternoons on the porch in the sun, my
back against the railing, watching the line-up start to
form around three in the afternoon for the five o'clock
supper. I could look at individuals without having to
speak to them, sneaking glances as they sprawled on the
steps or made their way between the buildings.


Seen in the light, some were less scary, some even
more frightening. A few poorly dressed but tidy
middle-aged women would smile shyly at me as our
eyes accidentally met, or as I passed them on the stairway.
An old Korean gentleman bowed to me every time
he saw me, proudly displaying rotten and missing teeth,
laughing at whatever tickled him.


A horrible man with crawly lips and a head that
seemed glued to one shoulder gave me the shivers.
There were others with missing arms or legs. The old
guy who'd wielded the fork in the line-up turned out to
be fairly pleasant, buying me coffee the few times he
went down to McDonald's. He wouldn't speak; I wasn't
sure he knew English. He'd just shove the cup at me,
piled high with sugars and cream, then sit a few stairs
down from me and point his face at the sun.

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The first person to really speak to me was Andy,
which was lucky, since he was the least crazy. He stank,
but I suspected I did too. I never took off my clothes,
always ready for fight or flight, needing to feel a little
armoured. Deodorant was a luxury I couldn't afford,
and I wasn't about to attempt a bath in a room that
didn't lock, and which was always in high demand. Not
to mention that there was no plug for the tub, or hand
soap, or towels, or curtain, or mat.


Andy walked funny, with a kind of flat-footed waddle,
but his eyes looked unmedicated, and he was polite
and friendly, not given to sudden moves or bizarre statements.
We were probably the same age; certainly we
were in the same circumstances. Names first, then the
important stuff out of the way, like what hospital we
were from, I could finally begin to ask some of the
questions milling about in my head.


The house was owned, according to Andy, by a
couple who'd bought it a few years before. The husband
was the one who ran the place, who bought groceries
and collected the cheques. Andy didn't appear to know
any more than I did why this kind of place existed, but
he assured me there were hundreds of them. He'd been
in half a dozen or so himself.


He'd lived here for five years. I couldn't believe he
could say that so matter-of-factly. He shared a room on
the first floor, to the right at the bottom of the staircase,
with three other men. He seemed to hold most of the
tenants in easy contempt. He warned me about how
many thieves there were in the building, warned me

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As people would appear on the porch, he'd give me
thumbnail sketches of who they were and how long
they'd been here. Occasionally he'd yell at someone to
come over, and then he'd introduce me.


It was always like being introduced to the bogeyman.
Long minutes would pass before the fear stopped distorting
my vision and I could see them as people, as
individuals caught up in the same mess I was.


There were very few women in the house — less
than a dozen out of seventy — and those were mostly
elderly alcoholics.


"There's the Phoney Father, he's away now, but he'll
turn up soon as Miss Pattison's money runs out." Miss
Pattison liked to feed the birds with leftovers, but was
otherwise known as the house tyrant. Everybody in the
house had been, or was on the way to being, crazy. "But
if they get too nuts, the owner gets the hospital to take
them back, or kicks them out."


Andy went on to tell me that his second roommate,
Old Bob, was only really crazy on weekends, when he
was more a pain than a problem. "Tve shared that room
with him for years, and it's always the same — up early,
to bed early, yelling at us to turn off the light around
seven. Then he listens to religion on the radio Sundays,
and walks around yelling and cursing at the program,
damning everyone to hell. Him and that stupid pipe of
his. He's always setting off the smoke-detector and
getting yelled at. Then doing it again."

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One afternoon, a man-mountain with straggly black
hair, a growth of something on his chin that couldn't
really be called a beard, a bare, sunken chest and a lowriding,
ballooned-out stomach that hung over his belt
wandered out onto the porch. My hands began to sweat
and my breathing constricted.


"There's never a goddamn chair. I always bring one
out, and some stupid son of bitch goes and moves it!"
He spat something disgusting over the rail onto the
brown lawn, a gesture accompanied by hawking and
deep rumbling.


"Shut up, Gary, I'll get your bloody chair. This is Pat,
the girl I told you about."


Gary stuck out a grime-encrusted paw, and having no
choice, I offered my own, only to see it disappear in his.


"Hi. Seen you around. Felt sorry for you, you looked
so scared. Don't have to be scared. Get my goddamn
chair, Andy. And bring one for Pat."


He released my hand from his surprisingly soft grip,
and we waited in silence until Andy came back, dragging
a few kitchen chairs. In a moment, we were lined
up at the rail, our chairs tilted back, our three pairs of
feet hanging over, Andy on one side of me and Gary on
the other.


Andy continued, "I been telling Pat about the house.
She's not from around here, she's from Quebec."


Gary was trying to roll a cigarette, sprinkling tobacco
around his gaping navel and onto the porch.


"Well, you just don't worry. Andy and I have the
front bedroom." He gestured over his shoulder, sending

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Sure," Andy added, "ask me before you ask that
bastard Jack." The epithet didn't surprise me, since I'd
figured out that Jack was the one who served up insults
with the dinners.


It didn't take long to figure out that Gary's bark was
considerably worse than his bite. When he told me he'd
spent seventeen years in Whitby Psychiatric, I stared,
open-mouthed.


"Yep. They sent me there from training school. Then
the assholes give me a bus ticket and an address and I
wind up in this house."


"What got you sent to training school?"


"I don't know. Supposed to have tried to strangle my
mom when I was in grade school. That's what she says.
Training school scared the shit out of me, I was always
crying, then I got sent to Whitby."


He'd been here seven years. He remembered the last
owner, a born-again Christian.


"Ha! Some Christian! She had a mouth on her. And
the crap she called food ..."


Over the next few weeks, we talked, smoked and
drank coffee on the porch every sunny day. With names
and faces and histories to attach to people, the shadows
receded and I felt freer to move around the house. I was
accepted as Gary's friend, and protected.

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I thought a lot about Gary's life. He was very sweet
most of the time, but not a thinker, or if he did a lot of
thinking, he never shared it. There seemed to be a number
of people in the house whose life stories were similar:
a decade or two in hospital, then an abrupt
discharge to a boarding house. I knew how weird it felt
to return home after five months on a ward. Things
seemed to go so quickly. I'd forgotten how to do things
like cooking, wouldn't want to go to a restaurant or
shopping centre because of the crowds and the pace.
But after seventeen years? He admitted that one of the
first things he did was attempt suicide, hoping to get
back to hospital or die. He was kept overnight, then sent
back to his new home.


A long-standing habit of mine, developed during my
college years, was to try to reach beyond the barriers of
my own experience by attempting an empathetic
understanding of someone else. Sometimes consciously,
sometimes not. In the long, dangerous night hours, I
would try to relive parts of Gary's life in his skin, feeling
what he could not or would not express.


Imagine being taken away, sent away at a tender age,
pulled from your family, friends and school. Imagine
being taken into a hospital building where all the people
look possessed.


Imagine being told you have to stay. You have a sickness.
Staff tell you when and what to eat, when to wake
up, when to sleep, take medication, have a bath. You

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Imagine being told over and over for years that you
have to be locked up. And then some clown is standing
there, talking about how it's time for you to go; being in
hospital so long isn't good for you. Here's a ticket and an
address; a welfare worker will be by to see you, good luck.


Imagine you have no more control over this than
anything else in your life. This hospital, this staff, the
patients and the people you've been locked up with for
years have become closer than siblings you no longer
remember, but no one seems to mind that for the
second time you've been surgically removed from your
family. No one talks about missing you. No one
addresses the fears that are churning up your guts.
Seventeen years later, bloated by meds and starchy
foods, in donated clothing, with a cough that can be
heard four floors up, they send you out. No nurses, no
shrinks, no clean sheets, no full meals, no daily ration of
tobacco — you have to swallow this thing called
freedom.

"Ya play cards?" Gary asked me one rainy
afternoon.


"Sure, I know a few games."


"Like what?"


"Gin Rummy, Thirty-one..."


"Good enough, follow me."


Delores, to whom I'd already been introduced on the
porch, was drumming her fingers impatiently on the old
desk that had been the centrepiece of the common room
since a "crazy lady" had smashed in the television screen.


Two cloth couches faced each other against opposite
walls, replete with torn cushions revealing dribbles of
stuffing. Their original colour and/or design had long
ago been lost to coffee and urine stains, cigarette burns
and miscellaneous splotches better left unidentified. The
bare wooden floor had its own collection of <i>objete d'art</i>:
large soup tins overflowing with butts that served as an
emergency supply towards the end of the month. As in
my room, one bare bulb hung precariously on loose
wires from the ceiling.


The room was empty, except for Delores, who
looked even more normal than Andy. She wore her hair
curled and styled in the same way many overweight,
middle-aged ladies preferred; she even carried a purse,
knitting needles and a few balls of wool.


Delores rivalled Gary in size, and she was always first
at the dinner table in order to lay claim to the least
uncomfortable chair. This frequently led to a
five-minute argument, which Delores always won, since

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had begun to identify the hierarchy in the house; it
was a peculiar one, and jealously guarded. It was
accepted that Jack, who was a fellow resident but also
worked for the owner, ruled the kitchen and dining
room at 1245, with the more likeable Haddie as
second-in-command. In 1241-43, however, Gary,
Delores and Andy reigned supreme: partly because
they, too, occasionally did odd chores for the owner,
partly from simple length of tenure. Yet Andy and
Gary shared their bedroom with Old Bob. Andy slept
on what was little better than a cot, and Gary on a
mattress so done in that when he lay down the springs
would practically touch the floor. Delores herself
shared with three other women. Obviously, seniority
was no guarantee of better accommodation.


Although my room was no prize, I was beginning to
appreciate how much worse off I could have been.
Andy had already told me my "single room" had had
two men in it before my arrival. They'd been exiled to
the upstairs of 1245.


We sat around the desk, from which the drawers had
long since disappeared, awaiting a fourth player.
Normally it would have been Andy, but he was in his
room, asleep. Delores had the cards out and was peeling
them off a very sticky deck.


"Want me to get Little Pat?" Gary asked.


Delores rolled her eyes, shook her head emphatically
"no."

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was puzzled. Little Pat seemed very shy, obviously
mentally handicapped and awfully scrawny.


"You don't like playing with him?" I asked her, still
wanting to get a handle on everyone.


"Not unless there's absolutely no one else. He can't
play five minutes without cursing and storming out."


Nervously, I asked if he got violent. Both Gary and
Delores laughed.


'Only if you're a window or a Coke bottle. He
always has to break something when he's mad. You
could be standing right beside him, looking at all the
pieces all over the place, but when you ask him about it,
he has no idea who did it."


An old lady I had seen from time to time in the dining
room shuffled towards one of the cloth couches,
carrying in one hand a shopping bag that looked as
though it held crumpled up mounds of paper, her other
hand clutching the worn coat she tried to keep around
her shoulders.


"No wonder there's so many bugs in my couch," Gary
muttered meanly, though she didn't appear to hear him.


It took her a while to settle. First the bag went right
beside her legs, next her coat slipped in back of her as
she kind of collapsed backward, landing on the cushion
nearest the armrest. She had to struggle halfway up,
reach down to pull her bag closer, readjust the coat, pull
her dress over her knees and try to straighten the runs
that were all that remained of her pantyhose. I watched,
mesmerized. As soon as she appeared to reach a degree
of comfort, she nodded off.

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"That's Alice. She's an old drunk, nasty, too."


"She's a good one to stay away from," Delores agreed.


Pigpen, appropriately named, came in next. He
shoved one hand into a soup can for butts, then flopped
on Alices couch, jarring her and earning a stream of
abuse which he didn't seem to hear as he searched for a
cigarette paper. Alice's head dropped again. We could
hear soft snoring as Pigpen tore apart the butts for the
precious remaining tobacco.


Andy finally woke up and, without stopping to wash
or comb his hair, joined us at the desk.


"When the fuck are the cheques due?" he demanded.


"Not for another week, and don't forget you owe me
five bucks."


"Just deal the cards, Delores. I don't forget nothing."


"How do we get the cheques?" I asked, aware that
they were referring to the welfare allotments.


"We don't. What are you on, welfare or family
benefits?"


"Welfare, I guess. I saw a welfare worker."


"Whoop-de-do. You get the same as me. Eighteen
bucks. The rest the owner keeps. This fat son of a
bitch," he said, nodding at Gary, "gets family benefits.
He gets to keep a hundred, and I mean <i>keep</i> it, the stingy
bastard."


"Shut your mouth, Andy. I've brought you coffee lots
of times, you never pay me back. C'mon Delores, we
gonna play or just listen to him bitch?"


Dealing the cards was by no means easy; accumulated
grime and sweat had scored them and months of use had

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"The owner cashes them. He won't let us have them.
Says we'll take off and blow the rent money."


Eighteen dollars. Four packs of cigarettes and a tin of
aspirin. Or a tin of tobacco and a box of tampons. Sanitary
items were not supplied, though toilet paper was
supposed to be in every washroom. Deodorant was
almost unheard of. There were no laundry facilities in
the house, and little likelihood of finding or affording a
Laundromat.


I played my hand, keeping my head down, shocked at
what I'd heard. I was getting more depressed by the
minute. Not that I'd ever rolled in money, not that I
hadn't ever experienced poverty, but the grind of a
caffeine-less and tobacco-less existence was wearing me
down. I had been looking forward to having some cash
to spend, some "tailormades" (as packaged cigarettes
were referred to in the house), some temporary relief.


I continued to play listlessly, no longer participating
in the jibes that now sounded stale and tiresome. In the
back of my mind was a memory of a social worker who,
when I worked at the group home in Montreal, taught
Special Care Counselling to people already working in
the system. She had complained bitterly about welfare
recipients who, on cheque day, would ride in a taxi to
the liquor store, keeping the meter running while they

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I left the common room, claiming a headache, and
spent most of the subsequent week in an over medicated
fog, reminiscent of weekends slept away in the hospital.
It seemed as though most of the others coped in the
same way. From behind floor after floor of closed doors
came sobbing, fighting, cursing, hoarse voices speaking
to blank walls at all hours of the day and night.

I'd grown up with thoughts of death, always
keeping that final exit close to me. Every time I
fell into depression, every time life around me grew
grim, I would hold the possibility of escape like a secret
promise, and I did that now.


My earliest suicide attempt, clumsy and ineffectual,
happened when I failed an Easter report card in grade
five. I believed what my father had always told me: I was
stupid and lazy. I'd heard it so often I couldn't choose to
disbelieve it. It seemed I'd always been slow and stubborn.
I still couldn't tell time in the fourth grade,
couldn't add or subtract, despite my father's nightly
tutorials. I couldn't understand why I persisted in my
laziness when it always brought me so much grief. I
have very few memories of the time I spent in early
grade school, and those I have are riddled with beatings
and shame.

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I remember the small apartment in downtown
Montreal, the one with the alley in the back where all
the other kids played through long summer evenings. I
remember the dining-room table where he'd make me
sit beside him, grade four math book open in front of
me. I remember how quiet the house was with everyone
else in bed.


He'd make me leave one hand flat, palm down on the
table.


"Ten times ten."


I'd scratch the page nervously with my pencil, unable
to remember the right response.


"I said ten times ten."


My head would go blank. His heavy fist would come
crashing down on my hand till it seemed I had no bones
left unbroken. Every wrong answer brought pain,
causing me to panic so much that the few correct
answers I could remember scooted right out of my
brain, abandoning me to, his cruelty.


For years after I left home, and nightly in the
boarding house, memories would crash into my head,
triggered by screams or noises in the night.


Roars of anger. A single fork found dirty in the
drawer. Everything in the kitchen — plates, pots, cutlery
— emptied out and thrown on the floor, the five of
us dragged out of bed, beaten and forced to wash and
dry everything again. A fingerprint on the wall resulted
in us having to clean all the walls with rubber erasers,
finally released to bed as the sun rose. Dinners flung off
the kitchen table, children with their faces rubbed in

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After that Easter report card, I knew I couldn't go
home. Walking was difficult because I'd lost a boot miles
back. The mud had sucked it right off my foot. For a
panicked minute, I thought it was some weird form of
quicksand, and for someone who wanted to die, I
moved pretty fast to pull myself out. I didn't attempt to
rescue the boot, I just kept walking deeper into the
woods that bordered the school. I made progress, even
though I stayed off paths where the going would have
been easier.


The snow was humped into little mounds that were
grey and hard. In several places, large pools of water had
been created by the gradual melt. I got colder. I could
no longer feel my foot; it was like walking on a stump.
There were no spring sounds, no scampering squirrels,
only ominous silence and a sky filled with dark clouds.
Maybe, I thought, it will snow and cover my tracks.
That would be good, lessen my chances of being
caught.


The afternoon seemed to be edging towards nightfall.
Turning in a complete circle, I could see no civilized
area in any direction. It might be all right now to rest, to
stop, to do what I'd come to do. I picked out a large,
lifeless tree and sat down on the damp ground, my back
against its trunk. Fumbling around in my schoolbag, I
searched for the knife I'd lifted from the kitchen that

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mitts were stiff and wet, my fingers numb and
unresponsive. I was afraid to think, could still hear echoes
of my father's rage, hear his condemnation of me, all the
warnings he'd screamed about what would happen if I
didn't smarten up. I didn't know what was the matter
with me, why I was so stupid. Why, every time I was
asked a question in class, my insides would seize up, my
mind desert me. It wasn't as if I wanted to be that way,
even though he often said I chose to be stupid. Maybe
my mind didn't work the same as other kids', maybe I
was slow, like that one teacher had said.


"I'm sorry," I whimpered, hugging myself and shivering
violently, "I'm sorry." Words I'd spoken all my life.
I'm sorry for my lousy grades, sorry for the dirty dish, the
broken cup, sorry for all the bad things I've done, all the
beatings I've caused. His voice surrounded me: "Sorry!"
Dripping with scorn. "Sorry? If you think you're sorry
now, just wait, just wait till I get my hands on you!"


I tested the tip of the knife against one finger and
stared in awe at the red seeping into the mitt. Was it that
easy? Working the buttons on my coat was hard with
frozen fingers, but I got them undone. My body was
shivering hard. I dropped the knife and vomited into the
patchy snow.


I huddled into myself, pulling my coat tighter, sick
and increasingly afraid. How long does it take to freeze
to death? I wondered in my sluggish brain. Or simply
to starve?

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was getting darker. I shrugged the coat off my
shoulders and lay on it, not allowing myself to pull it
over me. I'll just fall asleep and never wake up, that's
all. It can't take that long, it's so cold here. More time
passed. All there was was cold, inside, outside. Neither
sleep nor death came to rescue me. Everything hurt.
Why did everything always have to hurt?


I heard something. That was a train whistle! I held
my breath, waiting for the sound to come again. It did,
and all my plans fled. I managed to stand up by hugging
the tree trunk, got my coat off the ground and
back around my shoulders. I followed the sound of the
train, limping on feet that felt swollen and dead. Even
as I trudged through icy puddles and packed snow, I
wondered if they'd have to cut them off. The tracks
were surprisingly close, and in my desperation I was
hysterically happy to see them.


I didn't know which direction meant warmth, but
chose one, moving automatically, keeping my eyes on
the closely spaced railway ties. It was a very long walk.
Still, all too soon, there, just ahead, was the house. The
sight of it hit me in the chest like a blow from a fist. I
could hear my heart in my ears. Still, I trudged on, up
the stairs, to open the door, to hear him shout:


"Where the hell is the bitch? It's six o'clock!"


I'd only been gone three hours. He was in the
hallway, ready for me. And it started. Through it all, I
was dimly aware that whatever he did to me was
nothing compared to what I'd done to myself ... by
coming home.

Andy jarred me out of my comatose state
by banging on my door and calling out to me
that Gary wanted to see me. I was shaky from the
week's retreat, dull-brained, headachy, but I went down
the three flights to see what was up.


Gary was caving in the centre of his mattress, feet
planted wide apart, demolishing a Big Mac. He
reached behind his considerable bulk to grab
something and thrust it at me. Fresh-cut flowers
wrapped in pretty paper blossomed from his meaty fist.


"Here. Don't say I never gave you nothing."


Amid the odour of dried urine and stale farts, the
roses smelled like a bit of heaven.


"Ah, Gary." My voice sounded rusty and strange
after days of non-communication.


"And these too." He produced two packs of tailor-mades,
a Big Mac and a coffee. After days of deprivation,
these were indeed significant gifts. I knew this
time the blurred vision wasn't caused by the medication,
and I leaned over to kiss his grizzled cheek,
touched deeply by his gruff thoughtfulness. He
hurriedly waved me back, blushing wildly.


"Get away, get away! Wimmin, jeez."


The card games that night were much livelier, and I
caught sight of people I hadn't yet realized lived here.


For some reason that evening I kept thinking about
the rare times my father would bring us anything sweet
or special. He would call us down to the "family
room," saying Ed Sullivan was on, and during the show

With no calendars or clocks in the house, it
was hard to tell what day or month it was. So
many days were simply slept away, thanks, in large
part, to the profusion of psychotropic medication lying
around everywhere: Largactil, Nozinan, chloralhydrate,
Haldol.


On my way to the porch, a day or two after Gary's
magnanimous gesture, I was forced to pick my way
through a crowd of tenants who'd spilled up the stairs
from a line-up that started flush with the owner's office
door. It was a growly, restless crowd, almost as bad as
the supper line-up, so I was relieved to make it outside
without incident.


Gary was already in his chair, and he lit a smoke for
me, waving back at the house.


"See the vultures waiting? That means he's cashing
the welfare cheques. Try and grab him 'fore he leaves,
if you want your bread."


I nodded but stayed in my chair for another hour or
so, until Andy came out to tell me the owner wanted
to see me. It was like being summoned to the principal's
office. I didn't know what to expect from this
mysterious figure.

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

His office door was open, so I just walked in and
stood waiting to be noticed by the brown man who
was ensconced behind the desk, and yelling into the
phone in a language I didn't recognize. I picked up one
of the scattered chess pieces, a white bishop carved
from pale wood.


"Do you play?" asked an accented voice, startling
me into dropping the piece. He'd hung up the phone
and was looking at me hopefully over dark-rimmed
glasses.


"Not too well, but I enjoy the game."


"Good! Set up the board while I find your cheque."


Before we started, he counted out a ten, a five and
three ones, as I scribbled my signature on the back of
the cheque that lay face down on the desk. It was the
first cash I'd seen in some time, and I pocketed it with
mixed emotions.


It wasn't luxuries I missed, or at least what I used to
consider luxuries. Before I'd left off working at the
group home, I'd smoked two packs of Gauloises a day,
was used to having some money in my pocket, could
buy music tapes when I wanted, ride city buses,
subscribe to newspapers, buy books in downtown
bookstores. On the other hand, poverty, hunger and
general deprivation were not absolute strangers to me.
In college, I had lived in a succession of rooming
houses strung along Dorchester Boulevard. I shared
kitchens with drunks, hookers and dealers, and even
some crazies. But poverty is different when you know
you're moving through it; it can even be charming and

Concentrating on the game was difficult, partly due
to the permanent fog in my brain, partly because the
office, when it was open, was an exceedingly busy
place. Latecomers looking to sign away their cheques,
others to pry their two-dollar daily allotment out of
the owner. He seemed to "trustee" money for those he
claimed would drink it all up the first day if left to
their own devices.


He was a good player, and used to functioning in a
chaotic atmosphere. I held my own, however, and he
was pleased enough with my performance to yell at
Andy and order him down to McDonald's for three coffees,
double-double, "And don't forget the receipt!" He
explained to me that at home he always drank his coffee
black, but since cream and sugar were supplied free at
the restaurant, he liked to load up.


He didn't ask me any questions, I didn't have to fill out
forms. We hardly talked at all, there were so many interruptions.
After he permitted me one victory out of three
games, he clapped me on the shoulder and said he had to
run, but that I was welcome to come down anytime he
was in and have a game or two. "Nobody else in this
crazy house knows how to play, and I miss it. Take care."


Not wanting to resume my theatre seat on the porch
till I had sorted out some of the impressions I took away
from meeting this fellow, I went to my room and
thought for a while. He wasn't a two-headed monster;

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Pat. Pat, I have to talk to you. It's very
important. Pat, are you awake? Please, I need to
talk to you."


He kept rapping at the door, punctuating every word.


"Who is it?" I yelled into my pillow.


"Me, Don Dixon. Please, Pat, talk to me."


It must have been after midnight. I'd been asleep till
he'd begun his assault on the door.


"Pat?"


"All right, Don. Go down and wait for me on the
front porch. I'll be there in a few minutes."


I was swearing softly as I listened to his retreating
footsteps. I'd met him only a few days ago. He'd come
back to the house after a third failed attempt to live with
his mother. The guys in the common room had
groaned when he walked in. Gary hadn't minced his
words: "Oh Christ, you back again?"


According to Delores, Don's mother was quite welloff,
but too old and tired to handle her mildly retarded,
schizophrenic son. She paid the owner extra rent to
encourage him to take Don back after every crisis. His
clothing was certainly expensive, but you had to look
closely to tell; he was a very sloppy, careless young man.

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now he was waiting for me downstairs. I resolved as I
dressed, despairing at the state of my clothing, to be
very firm with him in discouraging his late-night interruptions.
The days were quite long enough, more than I
could handle; I didn't need any extensions.


King Street was very still as I stepped out onto the
porch. The owner didn't waste money on external
lights, and the nearest streetlight had been shattered
again. The stores across the street were shut up and dark,
looking like a set for a "B" horror movie.


"Okay, Mr. Dixon," I started off brusquely, "I hope
this is really important."


I sat one stair up from him, intentionally distancing
myself. He immediately relocated himself, crowding
me, causing me some nervous concern.


"Pat, I had to talk to someone. Usually I like to talk
to the owner, but he's not here. He listens to me, he
takes care of me, he's my only friend. He lets me stay
here, even if he does yell at me and call me names
sometimes. I don't want to do anything to hurt him,
make him mad. Sometimes I do things, I start feeling
strange, I do stuff. Then everyone gets mad at me, they
all want to send me away."

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What is it you do, Don, that gets people angry with
you?" I asked the question calmly enough, but it took
some effort. After all, it was dark. There was no one
around. I'd just woken up. And he was spooking me.


He didn't answer my question, which increased my
uneasiness; my imagination was left to fill in the blanks.
I tried to ignore my percolating fears, and said quietly,
"Don. You woke me up. You said you wanted to talk.
You said it was important. Well, here I am. You must
have felt you could trust me, so why don't you?"


"I don't want to be locked up."


"I can't lock you up."


"I think maybe I should be locked up."


"Are you afraid? Do you think you might do
something bad?" I felt his whole body nodding jerkily.
Lovely.


"Okay, Don. What can I do or say that will make
things easier for you, help you get through this?"


"Do you think I should be locked up?"


I wasn't sure if he wanted a yes or no from me, but a
part of me felt he'd be reassured if I said yes. I didn't
have enough sense of him to trust my instincts in this
strange discussion, so I went with the therapeutic
response every ex-patient is used to.


"What I think isn't important. You know yourself
better than I ever will. Do you think you need to go to
hospital?"


I felt him thinking. I knew it wasn't easy for him, I
could feel him straining, trying to work out how he felt.
It's easy to let your imagination run off at night. A

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I don't know how much time passed. The dark thickened,
felt malignant.


"I think —" I almost left my skin at the sound of his
voice "— I think I'll be all right. I can stay here, if you'll
hold some things for me. The owner will be here in the
morning, he can take me to the hospital. He can make
them let me in. It's just tonight."


Oh, jeez. What was he going to give me. Pieces of
human torso? The head of a cat? How crazy was this
man? He moved his hands in the dark. I felt my pulse in
my ears. He touched my knees. I froze. Then I felt
things dropping into my lap ... normal things, everyday
things, reasonable things. He was not Norman Bates.
He was a confused, slightly retarded man of twentyeight,
who was showering me with packets of matches,
dozens of matches.


"Can you keep these away from me? Keep them away
from me? Then I won't do anything bad. No one will
have to shout at me. I won't be sent away with everybody
hating me and not wanting me back. Will you
help me?"


I breathed more easily, relieved.


"Are you sure you'll be all right? I'm happy to hold
on to these, but is that enough? Can you sleep, wait till
morning?"

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Now I can, yes. I feel better." He laughed, more easily,
I could feel the change. He touched my face lightly
with the tips of his fingers. "Thank you. It's nice to have
another friend. I'm going to bed now. And I'll be all
right. 'Cause of you. You have them, now I can sleep."


He left me sitting there, and he went over to 1245
where he shared a room on the third floor. I watched his
disappearing form, uncertain. Should I do something?
(What?) Should I call someone? (Who?) Was I handling
this right, and why was I handling this at all?


A half-hour later, I was stretched out on my bed, still
dressed. I was straining every sense, probing the three
houses, determined to keep watch through the night, to
have no harm come to the people in the houses.


The first siren had me running outside, not aware
that I'd crashed down three flights of stairs, just running
over to 1245. There Don stood talking to a police sergeant
as firemen entered the house. I heard him say, "I
was just coming out of the bathroom when I smelled
the smoke. I went into my bedroom and saw someone
had set fire to my clothes, and my mattress was burning,
too. I ran downstairs and when I seen your car, I waved
you down. Some of the guys here are pretty mean, it's a
lousy thing to do, set fire to someone's bed."


From the fire escape, a fireman warned us to step
back. A couple of them struggled with the mattress,
finally getting it over the railing. Sparks flew with it,
fireflies in the night, and rushed out in swarms as it
struck the ground. Don turned, saw me and smiled. I
was chilled.

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A number of things struck me at once. The smoke-detector
was obviously not working. None of the
tenants had woken up. They were still deep in their
drugged sleep. None of them had heard or sensed anything.
That was frightening, even more frightening than
the young man who was so pleasantly smiling at me.


"Don, you didn't give me all your matches, did you?"
I asked him, in front of the cop.


The sergeant looked at me, then at Don, then back at
me as I continued.


"Did you really need to do this? Did you want to be
locked up that badly? You risked everyone's life in there,
Don." He looked at me, still smiling, warm and trusting.
I talked to the policeman, feeling sad and bewildered
and overwhelmed by this place, these people, and
their strangeness.


The cop was gentle with Don as he led him to the car
and helped him into the back seat. Don smiled happily,
no malice, no fear. A sense of order, rightness came
from him, much more jarring than accusations of
betrayal. He waved goodbye to me when the patrol car
pulled away, pleased to be going where he needed to be,
pleased that they would have to open the door to the
locked place and let him in.
