At times those things that happened seem so very
far away. Right now is one of those times. It's August and hot
inside the house and out. Marilyn is fixing Sunday dinner.
Will it be a big dinner? Will she bring out that thick round slice
of ham she's been saving for today? Will she garnish it with
pineapple and serve it for a feast to Deb and Jen and me? She's
starting to do just that. She thinks it's what I want. But do I?
In this heat?


"Bob, are you <i>very</i> hungry?" Marilyn asks.


"Sure," I say and then I feel the heat close in on me and I see
the beads of sweat on her forehead below the brown curls of her
hair, tight-wound in the muggy heat.


"No, I'm not," I say. "Let's just have sandwiches. The lunch
meat. A snack, not dinner."


It's a strange thing to turn now from such petty but urgent
problems of present life back to a time when I stood, bent over,
looking some ten stories below me, out of a half-opened hotel
window, poised over a question of life and death, pondering
suicide. Did I really do that?


Yes ... yes, I did look out of that window on a January day in
1952 and thoughts of death did come: <i>Harrison was wrong.
There is escape from this strange, sad world. You don't really
have to stay and fight this losing battle against despair, as all
your weapons, your courage and your wit, melt like poor swords
of icicles in the sun.... How merciless this light which now
pierces hidden reaches of your memory, revealing truths of self
you cannot stand to see</i>....

I looked down dizzy depths to the hard concrete streets below
and the thought came, "Jump now!"


But I didn't. I pulled away. <i>Not now. Not yet. But now you
know. When you need it, this final comfort awaits your call.
But let it, this fine patient friend you've newly found, let it wait
just a bit. Please let it wait. You have a wife at home with a
baby growing large inside her</i>....


That's the way I first felt when I was sick. The sickness was
despair.


When did my insanity begin? The truth is I'm not conscious
that I was more than normally troubled until about January
1952. Perhaps before this time my moods <i>had</i> been a little
more intense than the moods of others. In my heights of enthusiasm,
in certain depths of youthful melancholy, in times of
painful shyness, in times of overbold self-confidence. But I had
had no serious emotional disturbances apparent in my past.


My parents were neither rich nor poor. They were good to
my two younger brothers and me. There was nothing strikingly
"different" about our family. On occasion we passed through
troubled times; but so did everyone else we knew.


I was introverted. I loved to read. But I'd loved sports,
too—swimming, tennis, basketball, football.


I had been a Life Scout, an aviation cadet. If I did not make
Eagle; if I did finally wash out of the cadet program; even if
I was not a complete success in all my youthful goals, still I
was not always a failure, either.


I set no worlds afire in college, but I did get my degree and
I won a few small honors along the way. I'd found myself a
good job after graduation and a good wife.


Certainly I wasn't conscious of any great abnormalities of
mood until the beginning of 1952. For that matter, I am certain
no one else felt I was a mental case before that time. I know
this to be true, since it was I who finally had to plead with my
friends that there <i>was</i> something wrong with me, something so

Just a few weeks before I stood at that open window in the
New York hotel debating suicide, I remember sitting behind
my desk, trying to dictate a memo. Now the problem doesn't
seem particularly difficult. But it did then.


I was a state representative for a national charitable foundation.
I was caught in the middle of a conflict between our national
officers and a local chapter that wanted to participate in
a program of which the national chairman disapproved. My
sympathies lay with the local group, and I couldn't completely
understand my boss's point of view. But the Foundation was
my bread and butter, both physically and spiritually, so I was
pulled to pieces.


Daniel Harrison, my boss, sensed my feelings, and was kind
enough to let me stand silent, except for introduction, through a
nightmarish meeting with the local group to discuss the situation.


There was one thing he did want me to do. He wanted me to
listen and later to report in a memo with copies to him and to
chapter headquarters in New York, details of the meeting. I
listened, but when it came time to put the thing down on paper
I couldn't do it.


The meeting had been hot. No matter what I said, somebody
was going to look bad and be hurt. I <i>couldn't</i> make Dan look
bad or hurt him and I didn't want to hurt the chapter and its
volunteers either.


So my secretary sat beside me with pencil poised in hand,
notebook on lap. And from 8:30 in the morning until about
10:15 I struggled to say something about that meeting and I
couldn't complete a single sentence!


My secretary, all patience, waited calmly, as if it were the
most normal thing in the world for me to keep her on dictation
almost two hours, without a word except an occasional muttering
that I couldn't write the memo because I couldn't remember any

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally I said, "Jeannie, tell Dan I'm sick. Tell him I've got
a bad cold. I'm going home."


I got up and went home and that was really my last day with
the Foundation, although they carried me on the payroll for
five months more.


How did I feel sick? I told Dan I wanted to resign,
and instead he told me to take a leave of absence until our
national convention in New York. He talked to me a long time,
and at the end of our conversation he said, "Try to pull yourself
together. Go fishing or something. But don't quit. Not now.
Not feeling the way you do. Not with your wife pregnant. Get
hold of yourself, and if then you decide you don't want to stay
with us, shop around. But don't quit without another job!


"You can't run away from everything. If you try, you'll carry
wounds with you that may never heal."


Dan Harrison talked to me and talked and talked, and he told
me personal things out of his life, his own past triumphs and
heartaches and present failures and disappointments. He talked
to me as if I were his son.


"You've done a good job but I can stick an ad or two in the
paper and get somebody just as good. And it would be a lot less
trouble than monkeying with you," he said, "but I'm worried
about you."


He couldn't help me. He kept me from quitting for a while.
But he couldn't help me. He pleaded with me. He raged at me,
but he didn't know how sick I was. Nor did anybody else. I
tried to tell him. By this time I was having trouble talking to
people. By this I mean I was so depressed and distraught that
my memory was slipping as far as recent events and names of
people were concerned, and I covered up by asking questions.


"Dan," I asked him, "how can I work—how can I live—when
I can't talk to people any more?"


But he didn't understand.

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I could still ask questions. I could, at a dinner with Marilyn
and Dan one night, ask all kinds of questions about the boiled
lobster she was eating and New England-born Dan could answer
them. But I couldn't make a positive contribution to a conversation.
It was strange. People either didn't sense what I was doing
or were too kind to mention it.


I went to see a personal friend, a doctor, a surgeon.


"Doc," I said, "I need a psychiatrist."


"You're nuts," my good friend Clarke answered. "There's
nothing really wrong with you. Get back to work. Just go back
to your job, and you'll be all right."


"But, Doc, I can't talk to people any more."


"You're talking to me now."


"It's not the same thing."


"Well, I'll send you to a friend of mine who knows a little
about this sort of business and ask him to give you a physical
and talk to you and you can take it from there. You can trust
this guy. If he sends you to a psychiatrist, fine. But I don't
think you need one."


"Thanks, Doc."


I saw his friend, a Dr. Weaver. He examined me and said
there was nothing wrong with me physically. But even as he was
talking to me, I was shivering. The trembly feeling was inside
and out. There was a funny weakness in me and most of all it
was in my legs ... around the knees. I was weak-kneed from
fear of something undefined. I've had the same feeling many
times since then, but later it became a familiar thing that no
longer compounded whatever vague terrors caused it.


Dr. Weaver said, "Try to go back to your job. Don't quit it.
I've seen a lot of men like you. They come in here with all kinds
of troubles and they've been running most of their lives. They
take one job after another. They take on a job and then they
run from it. You're trying to run for the first time. Don't. You
may never stop."


"Do you think I should see a psychiatrist?"

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Not necessarily. You might come in here for a bit and talk
with me. But first, right now, go back to your work and do what
you can."


"Give me the name of a good psychiatrist," I asked him. He
recommended a man, but I put off making an appointment with
him, afraid to hear what he'd say.


Time for the convention came, and they told me I wouldn't
be called on to speak in the meetings. They told me just to be
there and say hello to people. But they wanted me there. I went.
And pretty soon I was by myself in the hotel room and I was
looking out the window, down to the street far below. And I was
wondering whether or not it would be appropriate to throw myself
out that window. I opened the window....


I leaned out the window and then I drew back.


I do not know what pulled me away from that window and
back into the depressing safety of my room. Perhaps it was no
more than the thought that a less drastic, less final flight could
be the answer.


Perhaps if I just ran away from this place filled with people
I knew who were at the same time strangers with whom I could
not talk, and went home to Marilyn ... perhaps then everything
would be all right.


It was four o'clock in the morning when I entered Grand Central
Station. I asked a man where the ticket windows were. He
told me. The directions were not complicated, but I was numbed
by fear. I couldn't find my way to the ticket windows. Up and
down the flights of steps, street level to lower level, I traced and
retraced vertical and horizontal circles, and I could not find my
way.


I saw people coming and going, people sitting or sleeping on
benches, night watchmen and porters. But I was unable to
muster courage again to ask for directions and besides I felt I
wouldn't be able to understand them if they were given to me.
So after a while I decided to try to get back to my hotel. Somehow,
miraculously, I was able to find it.

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next day I told Dan, "I've got to get home."


"Bob, all you have to do is sit through the meetings. You just
have to be here!"


How could I tell him that I had reached a point where I just
couldn't think any more? And it took thought to smile correctly
at strangers and to greet them as friends, and it took thought to
talk familiarly with old friends when somehow they had become
strangers with names I couldn't remember.


"Dan, I've got to get home!"


"Let's call your wife, Bob, and talk to her. How will she feel
about this?"


We called Marilyn and I talked to her, crying as I did so.


Dan talked to her: "Marilyn, we'd better get him into a doctor's
hands up here. I think he should be in a hospital."


They talked on. When Dan set the phone back on its cradle,
he said, "She says you do whatever you say you have to do. If
you want to go home, she wants you home."


Dan, treating me like the helpless creature I had become, put
me on a sleeper out of New York for home that night.


A few days later I was notified that I'd been given a second
medical leave of absence. For a brief time, my responsibilities
to the Foundation were to be lifted once more, to be resumed
when I was ready for them. But this second leave did not help.


Just two weeks after my return from the convention ...
