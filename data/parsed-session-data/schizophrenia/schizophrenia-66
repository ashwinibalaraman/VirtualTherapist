INTRODUCTION:
The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.
The session that follows features the work of Dr. Richard E. Felder. 
<i>Richard Felder, MD</i> graduated from Emory University School of Medicine in 1944, served as a US Army physician in Germany and practiced internal medicine before going into psychiatry. With this medical background, Dr. Felder viewed clients' mental health along with their physical well-being and by linking the two, advanced a more holistic approach to healing. 
Dr. Felder was president of the American Academy of Psychotherapists and a founder of the Atlanta Psychiatric Clinic. He died in May, 2008.

THERAPIST'S INTRODUCTION:
There are three parts to this tape. Part one is a brief case history here; part two contains a recording of an interview held in May 1962 at which time the patient expresses her feelings about the electric shock therapy which she had had seven years previously; part three will be a brief follow-up. This recording is being made in 1964. Miss EST is now 21 years old. She was first seen by me in February 1957, having been referred by the physicians at a children's hospital because she was too nervous for them to examine. According to the parents, she was unable to go to school or Sunday school or to get out into a crowd and was extremely nervous. The onset had occurred three years previously at the age of 12 when soon after her menstrual periods began, she was unable to sleep, cried all the time and was referred to a psychiatrist (0:02:02.2).
According to his report she "had begun developing a hand washing mania, would put her shoes on and off time after time, lock and relock doors, cut lights on and off, zip and unzip her zipper many times. At the time Dr. X saw her she was having difficulty doing her schoolwork because of erasing and rewriting. It was his impression that she had a severe obsessive compulsive neurosis, and although he did not feel optimistic about the outlook, he felt it worthwhile to give her electroshock treatment." She had approximately 30 such treatments, ending in February 1955 (0:02:57.5). 
Later that year, she developed rheumatic fever with some heart involvement and finally a full-blown Sydenham's chorea. With hospitalization and adequate medical treatment, she recovered with no residuals.
At her first interview with us, she was 15 years old and explained that she didn't think those doctors that is the psychiatrist, knew what they were doing, that they just asked her a few questions and then kept giving her those things, by which she meant electric shock treatments. They had to hold her on the table to give them. She also explained that she gets pretty mad at herself and that she doesn't really see how her parents put up with her. Her parents explained that they had never had a "cuss fight" in 20 years of marriage, and that they had certainly not ever let the children know that they were angry with each other. Mother in a cold and steady voice described herself as a normal mother and a good mother. "I have worried quite a lot over her, didn't want her to know it. She's my only worry." She was asked by the pediatric psychiatrist, did you miss her while she was in the hospital? To which mother responded in a loud, harsh, shrill voice, "Miss her? Of course we did. We went to see her every weekend that we could. Of course we missed her (0:05:04.1)."
The patient herself described the ending of her ability to go to school. She had made only straight As in school. One day she was giving a report and became too anxious to remain in the classroom. The next day she returned to school but she spent the day in the restroom. After that, she was not able to go back. 
The staff conference regarding this patient arrived at a diagnosis of <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span>. It was recommended to the agency which had sent her that she have ten interviews only in psychotherapy and that definitive psychotherapy be postponed until she was past some of the turmoil of her life as it was at that time (0:06:14.8).
She was seen for these ten interviews and became less anxious. At the conclusion of the ten interviews she was re-evaluated and the report contains the following observations: "The changes which have taken place as brought out in the examination are as follows: she now likes to go out whereas previously her parents would have to beg her to; she still will not go to church; she sleeps better and has more interest in being helpful around the house; she now likes to ride her bicycle but doesn't like to get up in the mornings; she has become more irritable and has been able to get mad at her mother, whereas previously she used to want her mother with her all the time; her anuresis had stopped during the past month (0:07:18.8)."
One interview of the ten was rather remarkable in that the patient became terrified. She had been playing tic-tac-toe with me and I had absentmindedly let her win again. She became terrified at this point and this was the most feeling experience of hers and mine during the ten interviews. She was not seen again then until 1961 when she returned, this time sent by a different agency. She had not been seen by a psychiatrist since her ten interviews. According to father, she had been better than he at one time had thought she ever would be. She had been a sophomore in college when she called her parents to come and get her because she felt funny, had been upset for two months, including anorexia, insomnia, nausea and vomiting. Her parents still had not had a fight. She was still afraid of doctors because of the electric shock treatment and repeated "they had to hold me down." By this time she wanted to be a teacher. She had obtained a summer job. We again recommended ten interviews in psychotherapy and these were authorized by the referring agency. At the end of that time, the patient was still working and elected to continue psychotherapy at her own expense and at the reduced fee which the agency pays (0:09:46.9).
It was in May 1962 that the following interview took place. At the preceding interview the patient had become so anxious that she did not stay, but left the interview after it was about half over and did not return for the rest of that interview time.
The recording of the interview will be a little difficult to understand at times, and for this reason the transcript will probably be necessary. All the silences in the interview have been reduced to ten seconds, but the transcript will give you the exact length of the time of the silence. You will notice a sudden emotional reaction in the patient. I didn't know what this was about at first, and I was quite tense and anxious at that time. When she speaks of, when we went down there, she refers to the city where she had her electroshock therapy (0:11:02.0).
This is the interview.
BEGIN SESSION:
THERAPIST: Oops. You look pretty good today.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Feeling better?
CLIENT: (indiscernible)
THERAPIST: What's (indiscernible)?
CLIENT: (chuckling)
THERAPIST: If you were feeling perfectly wonderful, I'd be very suspicious (0:11:57.5).
CLIENT: (chuckling) (indiscernible) 
THERAPIST: Try though. Because I wouldn't understand it?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Wouldn't believe it. How often are you going in?
CLIENT: I think it's been about two weeks apart (0:13:00.0).
THERAPIST: If your parents thinking of you as going for a certain number of interviews, or are they thinking more long range than that?
CLIENT: I don't - I have a - would have guessed it was.
THERAPIST: As I remember I was pretty sloppy with my discussion of this with them. Wasn't very clear about it.
CLIENT: I don't want you to be like them (0:14:14.8).
THERAPIST: What do they make you feel?
CLIENT: I don't want to go. It makes me feel like - that I'm in that room again...
THERAPIST: Maybe it's a good thing for you to feel.
CLIENT: No, it isn't.
THERAPIST: For you to get past being scared of it.
CLIENT: I don't want to.
THERAPIST: You don't want to go through life being scared of it.
CLIENT: No. I don't want to go through that again because it's - I hurt (0:15:00.9).
THERAPIST: I sure don't blame you for that. 
CLIENT: I don't think you should do that. I don't (0:15:58.1).
THERAPIST: You didn't think they had an electric shock machine...
CLIENT: No, I know you don't.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: I know it, but sometimes I can't hold up and I can't - I just see it.
THERAPIST: No, I think that's a good thing for you.
CLIENT: I don't.
THERAPIST: You've got to feel it until you...
CLIENT: I don't want to.
THERAPIST: All through being scared again.
CLIENT: It makes me - I feel like I can't breathe or anything.
THERAPIST: I feel it too.
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: I feel it too.
CLIENT: I need some more water.
THERAPIST: I'll go get it (0:16:58.7).
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: You're welcome. Want a cigarette?
CLIENT: No, thank you. 
THERAPIST: Do you mind?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Whiskey?
CLIENT: No (chuckling). I might need some.
THERAPIST: I'm sure glad you didn't have to leave this time. I think if you had left today you would have come back, though, don't you (0:17:59.4)?
CLIENT: I didn't want to. (indiscernible) that I used to - that we used to visit when I went down there and it just made me feel awful just to see when I love him, he's so sweet, but it still made me feel just scared just to see him because I knew that I used to stay with him when we went down there. I do, I've got to get over it. I want to. I mean, I want to go through it (0:18:58.3).
THERAPIST: Which is (indiscernible)?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: (indiscernible)
CLIENT: Okay (0:19:58.4).
THERAPIST: You must hate the doctors.
CLIENT: I don't anything that the [audio gap]. I don't hate them, I mean I can't hate them, but don't think they knew what they was doing, if you want to know what I think about it.
THERAPIST: I think you do hate them.
CLIENT: Well...
THERAPIST: And I think you may feel that same hate in here with me. But it's all right, because I'll be glad to hate you right back.
CLIENT: (chuckling) Well, okay. But I don't hate them. I don't think I could stand to see them (0:20:57.4).
THERAPIST: I don't believe that.
CLIENT: But why do you think I should hate them?
THERAPIST: I know I would. I think I do.
CLIENT: I think I'm mostly afraid of them. I was really a young - I just - I came across this picture and it, you know when you wrote the book? I just - something - and I just saw this picture, and it just, I don't know, it just made me feel awful, I just couldn't even stand to see his old picture. I can remember them going - the whole place and all the people there. And just every noise and every sound, I can remember it. And I can remember the way that I would stay awake at night and you could hear - I could hear them paging the doctors through their - and now, I can't - it hurts to go into a hospital and stay put down (ph) without being all shook up when I get out. And I can remember the way that they - and it smelled awful and dirty. Those people were dirty. At least give me something to make me asleep before I got down there, and I'd get there and I wasn't even able to walk. And just - you had to go into one room, sit and wait and to - it was awful, and then you'd go to another one and then you'd know that you had to go in there next. And it was just so awful. Lay you on the stretcher. I'm tired (0:24:59.1).
THERAPIST: You bite your fingernails?
CLIENT: I don't usually, I don't eat them. I bite this one sometimes.
THERAPIST: You just pick on one.
CLIENT: (chuckling) (indiscernible) I think this chair sits better than that one (0:26:07.8).
THERAPIST: I think it does too. I don't like to sit in that one.
CLIENT: I don't either.
THERAPIST: Well, I think I felt that you were too scared to get this far into the room before.
CLIENT: I was. I sat in that one where I was just stiff.
THERAPIST: And where you'd be at the door.
CLIENT: (chuckling) Where you know I could keep - you know I can't relax in that chair (0:26:58.7).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: My sister graduated last night, and I didn't even go. I wanted to but I think if it'd been less dark (ph) I would have, but I don't know, I just - I knew I couldn't. But she doesn't know why and I think she (0:27:55.5)...
THERAPIST: Think she's mad?
CLIENT: And I know she's not mad, I just - well I think she's just sort of hurt a bit because I didn't go. She isn't mad, I don't think.
THERAPIST: Does she live with you?
CLIENT: Yes, she's - yes, she does. I live at home.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Well, you know she does.
THERAPIST: (indiscernible) I guess that was kind of dumb. But how could she live with you and not know that you have a lot of trouble going places?
CLIENT: Oh, she knows it, but I don't know (indiscernible) - they all do, but I mean, I don't tell them why, and...
THERAPIST: Do you know why?
CLIENT: I don't know what I do and I didn't know what to tell her, but I couldn't tell her that I was just afraid to go because I didn't want to. And my grandma always saw her, she used to say oh, come on honey, go to church with us today. And I didn't say anything, I didn't say anything, I just you know kept myself calmed down so I might - if anybody says anything I just fly all over the place, I can't help it, I don't even know I'm going to do it. My sister's boyfriend does it when - he'd say, go get your dress on, let's go to church. So I told him, I didn't even know I was going to do it, I just - I said, I didn't think I was old enough to go. But that's like asking - and then my grandma started asking me like, I'd turn everything off the dresser on the floor because I can't stand it anymore, telling me to go because I want to.
THERAPIST: How do you feel about these outbursts after you have them?
CLIENT: Well I feel real embarrassed and bitter after it.
THERAPIST: Better or bitter?
CLIENT: Well...
THERAPIST: Or both (0:29:59.6)?
CLIENT: Well, sometimes both I guess. I don't know if I feel better or not. I just, I don't (indiscernible) I don't tell them anything though.
THERAPIST: How come you don't tell them you're afraid?
CLIENT: Because I didn't do so (ph), well why are you afraid, I'd say well, I don't know.
THERAPIST: You could tell them that's what you're coming here to find out.
CLIENT: (chuckling) Well, I think it's - I just can't tell them, that's all. Maybe I don't want - or I don't know what.
THERAPIST: Afraid it would upset them?
CLIENT: I don't know, I don't know if it would or not. I don't - I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. I just know that I just can't stand things anymore (ph). I'm just sort of tired of everything. I'm just (0:31:35.2)...
THERAPIST: Would you be surprised if I told you anger is encouraging to me (0:32:00.6)?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Well, it is. I think they've been pushing you around for years and you're beginning to get tired of it. I'll take part credit for that.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: What you thinking (0:32:56.9)?
CLIENT: (chuckling) Well, I'm just wondering, if hadn't told them (indiscernible) what I was doing, that's all. And then I thought wait, well - I thought maybe well, you might have to get me some of your whiskey but I never had any before (chuckling).
THERAPIST: (chuckling)
CLIENT: And I didn't - and that's all.
THERAPIST: Oh, I have all sorts of things handy.
CLIENT: (chuckling)
THERAPIST: If you need them. I'll take part credit for that too. You're beginning to seem like a real human being (0:33:56.6).
CLIENT: Thank you (chuckling), I guess.
THERAPIST: (chuckling) You're welcome. Wouldn't surprise me if somebody asks you for a date soon.
CLIENT: What do you think, I've been proposed to (chuckling).
THERAPIST: You have?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: I'm going to have to turn him down I guess.
THERAPIST: You mean just recently?
CLIENT: Yes. Well, I mean not recently (indiscernible), I've just been putting it off (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Well, congratulations (0:34:56.8).
CLIENT: Well, I think he's only really staying because he's what - I mean I still don't know - he doesn't know about me. I mean he doesn't - he didn't ever know about me before I got - before I went to school and so I never did tell him. But that's not why I'm not - that's not why I don't - I'm not going to accept it. It's because I just don't think I - he's the boy for me anymore. I liked him until this happened, okay.
THERAPIST: Until he proposed?
CLIENT: Mmm hmm.
THERAPIST: How long have you been going with him?
CLIENT: Over a year, about two years. I hadn't - I mean I just don't think that (indiscernible). I don't want to get married (0:36:16.5).
THERAPIST: Still nice to be proposed to.
CLIENT: I know it. It is. But I still think it would be a different story if he knew me. I mean if he knew all about it.
THERAPIST: Well, since you're not going to accept him anyway, why don't you tell him and see? He might have a story to tell you.
CLIENT: (chuckling) He might, I don't' know (0:37:10.1).
THERAPIST: You ready to go?
CLIENT: Mmm hmm.
THERAPIST: Bye.
END SESSION
THERAPIST'S NOTE: 
This particular interview was the sixth of a second series of ten interviews, and when it took place I was not sure whether I would be seeing this young lady beyond those ten interviews or not. Therefore, I was intent on accomplishing as much as possible. I was eager to make maximum use of what might be a limited time (0:38:05.6).
I had a great deal of personal feeling involvement with her as you could probably tell from the interview, and I felt secure enough in my feelings of affection for her to be able to get into the depth of her fear of another assault by a psychiatrist. I felt her terror with her, yet I didn't feel that it was necessary to interrupt it, but rather that I was ready to help her explore the feeling which of course goes beyond the content of the experience with electroshock therapy. I as well as she was tired at the end of the interview (0:38:54.2).
It is rare in my experience for a patient to experience repeated emotional upheavals in the same interview like she did. I felt a profound respect for her capacity to do this.
The - actually she elected to continue her psychotherapy beyond these ten interviews at her own expense, and for awhile she paid the reduced fee that the agency pays. Later, she elected to pay a regular outpatient fee in spite of the fact that that meant she could not have her interviews more than once4 every three or four weeks (0:39:52.5).
The relationship reflected in this interview has continued and there has been another episode of terror similar to this one, but non-specific. That is, it was not a reliving experience per se, but rather a terror that had no content. She went through it rapidly in the interview and was much more stable in her feelings afterward. The factual follow-up includes the fact that this summer job she had became a permanent job and she has since gotten a promotion. She continues her relationship with her boyfriend and on a somewhat more realistic basis. She has bought herself a car and drives to the interview but always brings someone else along with her. She continues to live at home with her parents and grandmother and is looking forward to the time when she will be courageous enough to drive many miles actually for her interview alone (0:41:16.8).
Addendum
THERAPIST'S NOTE:
Since this tape was made, Ms. EST has had another interview. This she did arrive having made the trip all by herself, and was very pleased with this. She had had a dream in which they were moving into a new house which was all sunshiny. She thought about her old room and decided she didn't want to go back to it except that sometimes she would go there for a little while and just sit (0:42:03.6).
She also had decided that she will never be satisfied until she finishes college. This is the end of the recording.
