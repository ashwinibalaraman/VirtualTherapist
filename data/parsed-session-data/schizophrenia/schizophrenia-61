I remember my first dream -- or, at least, the first that I can remember. I
was moving through white, with no objects, just white, although bright
spots of fluffy colour surrounded me everywhere. I passed through them,
and they passed through me. It was the sort of thing that made me laugh.


This dream came before any others with shit or people or monsters in
them, and certainly before I noticed the difference between the three. I
must have been less than three years old. This dream depicted the nature of
my world at that time. Awake, I pursued the dream relentlessly. I would
face the light shining through the window next to my cot and rub my eyes
furiously. There they were. The bright fluffy colours moving through the
white. ‘Stop that!’ came the intrusive garble. I'd continue merrily. Slap.


I discovered the air was full of spots. If you looked into nothingness,
there were spots. People would walk by obstructing my magical view of
nothingness. I'd get past them. They'd garble. My attention would be
firmly set on my desire to lose myself in the spots, and I'd ignore the garble,
looking straight through this obstruction with a calm expression soothed
by being lost in the spots. Slap. I was learning about ‘the world’.


I learned eventually to lose myself in anything I desired -- the patterns
on the wallpaper or the carpet, the sound of something over and over
again, the repetitive hollow sound I'd get from tapping my chin. Even
people became no problem. Their words became a mumbling jumble, their
voices a pattern of sounds. I could look through them until I wasn't there,
and then, later, felt that I had lost myself <i>in them</i>.


Words were no problem, but other people's expectations for me to
respond to them were. This required my understanding what was said, but
I was too happy losing myself to want to be dragged back by something as
two-dimensional as understanding.


‘What do you think you're doing?’ came the voice.


Knowing I must respond in order to get rid of this annoyance, I would
compromise, repeating ‘What do you think you're doing?’ addressed to
no-one in particular.


‘Don't repeat everything I say,’ scolded the voice.

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00011&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sensing a need to respond, I'd reply: ‘Don't repeat everything I say.’


Slap. I had no idea what was expected of me.


For the first three and a half years of my life this was my language,
complete with the intonation and inflection of those I came to think of as
‘the world’. The world seemed to be impatient, annoying, callous and
unrelenting. I learned to respond to it as such, crying, squealing, ignoring
and running away.


On one occasion, instead of simply ‘hearing’ a particular sentence, I
truly understood it because it had <i>significance</i> for me. I was three and a half.
My parents were visiting some friends, and I was standing in the hall
outside the lounge. I was giving myself whizzies -- arms outstretched,
spinning round and round. I have a vague recollection that there were
other children there, for the topic of discussion in the lounge had
disturbed and embarrassed me. A question was asked about my toilet
training. My mother replied that I was still wetting myself.


I don't know whether this had done the trick, but I became more aware
of needing to go to the toilet. I certainly had a great fear of going to the
toilet at this time. I would hold on for what seemed like for ever, and then
go just before I did it on the spot. Sometimes I would hold on for several
days until I was so constipated that I would vomit up bile. Then I became
afraid of eating food, too. I would eat only custard, jelly, baby-food, fruit,
lettuce leaves, honey and white pieces of bread with multicoloured
‘hundreds and thousands’ sprinkled on top, like my dream. In fact I ate the
things I liked to look at and feel or which had nice associations for me,
more than anything else. Rabbits ate lettuce. I loved fluffy rabbits. I ate
lettuce. I loved ‘see-through’ coloured glass. Jelly was like that. I loved jelly.
Like other children, I ate dirt and flowers and grass and bits of plastic.
Unlike other children, I still ate flowers, grass, bark and plastic when I was
thirteen years old. The old rules applied. If I liked them, I would try to lose
myself in my fascination for them. Things, unlike people, were welcome to
become a part of me.


When I was about three, I had signs of malnutrition. Though not
skeletal, I was blue and would bruise at the slightest touch. My eyelashes
would come out in large quantities, and my gums bled. My parents
thought I had leukaemia, and took me for a blood test. The doctor took
some blood from my ear-lobe. I co-operated. I was intrigued by a
multicoloured cardboard wheel the doctor had given me. I also had
hearing tests because, although I mimicked everything, it appeared that I
was deaf. My parents would stand behind me and make sudden loud

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>I thought I felt a whisper through my soul,<br />
Everything is nothing, and nothing is everything.<br />
Death in life and life in death of falsity</i>.


The more I became aware of the world around me, the more I became
afraid. Other people were my enemies, and reaching out to me was
their weapon, with only a few exceptions -- my grandparents, my father
and my Aunty Linda.


I still remember the smell of my grandmother. She wore chains around
her neck. She was soft and wrinkly, wore knitted that I could put my
fingers through, had a husky laughing voice and smelled of camphor. I
would take camphor off the shelves at the supermarket, and twenty years
later bought bottle upon bottle of eucalyptus oil and spread it around my
room, corner to corner, to keep out everything else except for the
comforting feeling that association gave me. I collected scraps of coloured
wool and crocheted bits and would put my fingers through them so that I
could fall asleep securely. For me, the people I liked <i>were</i> their things, and
those things (or things like them) were my protection from the things I
didn't like -- other people.


The habits I adopted of keeping and manipulating these symbols were
my equivalent of magic spells cast against the who could invade me if I lost
them or had them taken away. They were caused not by insanity or
hallucination but simply through harmless imagination made potent by
my overwhelming fear of vulnerability.


My grandfather fed me sultanas and biscuits, piece by piece. He made
up special names for everything; he sure knew his audience. He understood
my world and so was able to make me fascinated with his. He had
some liquid mercury balls which he would splatter into tinier balls and
make them chase one another. He had two minute magnetized ‘Scottie’
dogs, which he would make chase one another. This sort of chasing was

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One day I went out there. He didn't notice me. His face was purple and
blotchy. He was lying on his side. Pop never woke up again. I never forgave
him for doing this until I was twenty-one, when it suddenly dawned on me
that people don't intentionally mean to die. Then I cried, and I cried, and I
cried some more; it had taken me sixteen years.


My father stopped existing when I was about three. Up till then, he --
like my grandfather -- intrigued me, by calling things by special
names. There was Cyril the fox, Brookenstein the cat, Charlie Warmton
the bed, and I was Polly the possum or Miss Polly. He had actually called
me this because I was echolalic till I was four, repeating meaninglessly in
echo everything I heard, just like a parrot.


My father catered to my fascination for small fancy things and shiny
objects. He would bring me something different every week and would
always build me up by asking me if I knew how special and magical these
various bits and bobs were. I would sit on his knee, my eyes fastened to the
object, listening to the story as though he were one of my storytelling
records. In my head I would do the introduction: ‘This is an original little
long-playing record, and I am your storyteller. We are going to begin now
to read the story of...’ I still have those treasures, twenty-three years later.
The he -- who he was -- deserted me. When I found another he who I liked,
many years later, it took me several years to make the connection that these
two people were in fact the same person.


My mother was as hard as I was gentle, though strangely we shared
the same distant and unreachable nature.


I had an older brother. I think he became her ‘only’ child. She had
wanted to put me in a children's home, and I recall being terrified and
hysterical, kicking my feet against the car as she tried many times to force
me in. I knew the terror of what else she could dish out, and if being sent to

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perhaps she wanted a daughter, for she would dress my brother up as
both the girl and the boy on alternate days and take him out for walks in
the pram. We were both pretty children, but he could ‘act normal’ and was
not so embarrassing.


I am sure my father thwarted her efforts by giving my grandparents the
responsibility for me. Perhaps, too, they had tried to reach me and
persisted beyond the point where her hope had run out. Nevertheless, my
father paid the price for this, as did their relationship. He was ordered not
to speak to me and to have nothing to do with me. When my mother
spoke, the room shook. You listened, even if you did not hear.


Admittedly my father was as insensitive and indifferent to her and my
older brother as she was to me. The family was split straight down the
middle on a downward decline which spiralled before crashing headlong
into the pits of hell.


The names my parents called me exemplified this split. To my father I
was Polly. To my mother I was Dolly, and in her own words I learned who I
was: ‘You were my doll, and I was allowed to smash it,’ she told me over
and over again. It became a chain reaction. The tension would explode, he
would degrade and abuse her, and she would degrade and abuse me. Both
of them had found forms of escape which persisted on and off over many
years, leaving in their wake more destructiveness than I could ever have
conjured up in the magic of my insular little world.


I never hugged either of them; neither was I hugged. I didn't like
anyone coming too close to me, let alone touching me. I felt that all
touching was pain, and I was frightened.


My mother her was a person who, although she had no friends to impress,
took pride in how her children looked. So she would brush my hair.
I had long curly blonde hair, and she would tear through it and its many
knots with a vengeance.

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My Aunty Linda loved to brush my hair, though she would do it so
lightly that I would find it annoying. ‘Am I hurting you?’ she would say, as
though I were some breakable china doll. ‘Harder,’ I would order. And,
though careful not to tear through the knots, she would sit there brushing
my hair for ages as I would sit there enjoying <i>feeling</i> it. ‘You have fairy hair,’
she would say, ‘so silky, and look at the way it fluffs out.’ I liked the words
that she used and thought about the feel of such things. For many years I
played with, touched and chewed my own hair. Touching other children's
hair was the only friendly physical contact I would make.


<i>The wisps surround me in my bed,<br />
They hover there for to protect me;<br />
For the wisps, they are my friends</i>.


People were forever saying that I had no friends. In fact my world was
full of them. They were far more magical, reliable, predictable and real
than other children, <i>and</i> they came with guarantees. It was a world of my
own creation where I didn't need to control myself or the objects, animals
and nature, which were simply <i>being</i> in my presence. I had two other
friends who did not belong to this physical world: the wisps, and a pair of
green eyes which hid under my bed, named Willie.


I was afraid to sleep, always had been; I would sleep with my eyes open,
and I did this for years. I guess I did not appear to be terribly normal.
‘Haunting’ or ‘haunted’ would have been better adjectives. I was afraid of
the dark, though I loved the early dusk and dawn.


My earliest memory of the wisps was when I began to sleep in a bed. It
must have been in the new house we lived in, though the old one had, in
my mind, blended into this one. It was as though it was now a series of
rooms that I could no longer find within the new house. This disturbed
me. I liked to know where everything was -- including my parents I had to
know where everyone was and that they were all sleeping before I could
go to sleep. I would lie in bed, stiff and silent, listening for an end to the
muffled household sounds around me, as I watched the transparent wisps
hovering over me.


The wisps were tiny creatures. They hung in the air directly above me,
and looked something like wisps of hair, which is probably where my

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Other than the wisps, my bed was surrounded and totally encased by
tiny spots which I called stars, like some kind of mystical glass coffin. I
have since learned that they are actually air particles yet my vision was so
hypersensitive that they often became a hypnotic foreground with the rest
of ‘the world’ fading away.


By looking through stars and not at them, I could see them, and the rule
was that I could not close my eyes or they would leave me, unprotected
against intruders coming into the room. Feeling safe was a tiring business.


And the intruders came. They were responsible for taking away my
protection, for in the change of focus the tiny spots would disappear,
leaving me feeling angry and betrayed by my protection having left me
alone, exposed and vulnerable.


I knew that people were disturbed at me sleeping with my eyes open. I
soon learned to close them when I heard them coming, to play dead and
never look at them or let anything register when they lifted my eyelids or
even poked me in the eye. I was breathing, so they knew I wasn't dead.


The wisps left me by the time I had started ‘proper’ school, though the
stars around me as I slept (probably a later version of the spots) persisted on
and off, and sometimes still do.


Willie was another story. Willie had begun at the same time as the
wisps. I was probably about two years old. Unlike the wisps, he gave
me no comfort but he was a form of protection against intruders in the
night. He was no more than a pair of piercing green eyes which could only
be seen in the darkness. I was frightened of him, but so, I thought, were
they; and so, come hell or high water, I sided with this character. As with
anything I became close to, I would try to lose myself within it. I took to
sleeping under the bed and I became Willie.


By this time I was three years old. Willie became the self I directed at
the outside world, complete with hateful glaring eyes, a pinched-up
mouth, rigid corpse-like stance and clenched fists. Willie stamped his foot,
Willie spat when he didn't like things, but the look of complete hatred was
the worst weapon and Donna paid the price.

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By now I was interacting with the outside world as Willie. The name
was probably derived from my own surname, and some of the behaviour
was certainly modelled upon and in response to my violator: my mother.


Willie learned to use other people's phrases back at them in some sort
of meaningful yet attacking way. Though silence still seemed a far deadlier
weapon. My mother began to think I was evil and possessed. It would have
been easier to forgive her if she had suffered from hallucinations. She
didn't. Her lack of education and upbringing, her isolation and her
drinking, accounted for these beliefs more in terms of explanation than of
delusion.


My mother had retreated into a world of her own; but, unlike mine, it
held no safety for her. Her only salvation and her only friend was
my brother. It was a war in which I was to fight alone. They took a side together,
and together they would gang up.


I was a nut, a retard, a spastic. I threw ‘mentals’ and couldn't act normal.
‘Look at her, look at her,’ they would say to a child who, to them, was
either ‘a retard’ when I was in my own world or ‘a nut’ when I was in theirs.
I couldn't win.


Looking at it from their point of view, I guess they couldn't win, either.
My brother had probably woken up to the fact that I hardly acknowledged
or accepted him, and my mother had long since been robbed of a life and
the pride she so badly needed and had been lacking long before I ever
came along. She became the tormented single mother. He became the
too-important only child. And, as their accusations flew at me, so, too, did
the accusations fly at them from everyone else.


People were saying that she had caused me to be so withdrawn by her
coldness and her violence. She probably believed this, and I let her. Had I
ever wanted to reach out as myself to the intrusive outside world, I am sure
she would have inhibited me. Yet even battered children form attachments
with such a parent. I never did.


If I had wanted a war in the first place, I guess I won it. Though she was
a social cripple before I was born, I accept my share of the responsibility
for making her one more so, and for robbing both her and my brother of a
free, more independent relationship with each other which has resulted in
his rejection of her all these years later.

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When my mother and father had fought alternately for his keeping me
at home and her putting me in an institution, they must each have had their
own conception of the future. Each was right. I became a rewarding
experience for him. I became my mother's hell. My mother had one
reward. I was her little dancing doll. I was Dolly, the doll she never had.


When I was three, my mother took me to my first dancing lesson. I
walked on tiptoe, loved classical music and would make up dances,
by myself for myself, and this was taken as an indication that I would do
well at ballet. I loved pretty things and accepted the ribbons and netting
and sequins. Wearing them made them part of me; I had no objections.
Other people wanting to take a part of this from me to share it was another
matter altogether.


I remember the low cyclone fencing outside the weatherboard hall in
which I was to give one of my first and last public performances for a long
time. I remember the dirt path which had worn down in the middle of the
grass strip we were walking along. It was probably a driveway, but this was
how I saw things: bit by bit, a string of pieces strung together.


We went up a few steps and through the double wooden doors. I was
captured by the room, by the wood and by the smoothness of the floor. My
mother was probably fantasizing about how much she had longed to be in
my shoes when she was a child.


My mother was the second of nine children and the second daughter.
Her family was poor, and instead of distributing what little extras
they got among all of the children, the eldest daughter seemed to get it all.


The Salvation Army entertained the others whilst the eldest daughter
got dolls, pretty clothes and dancing lessons. My mother had watched her
in hate and awe. She gave up competing and tried for the role of the eldest
boy and won it. It was not as glorious, not as glamorous, built little sense of
self-worth, but it gave her a position and was handy for getting satisfaction
from violently thumping into her older sister and the friends she never
made.

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Her sister thrived on the attention she got, becoming charismatic and a
charmer. Ultimately she paid in guilt and shame, reaching out for
forgiveness from her younger sister, who greeted this with the same
amount of mercy she got from me: none.


It seemed that there were children everywhere. Pink arms and legs protruded
from torsos clad in Willoughby Dancing School black leotards.
The rowdy rabble began to subside as the sharpness of the instructor's
voice broke through.


The children created lines. We had all become a big square of
horizontal parallel lines. ‘Eyes to the front.’ ‘No, you move over to the left.’
‘No, not right, left.’ ‘Look, you stand here.’ Helpful invasive arms,
instructing, interfering. Me looking at my feet. The walls were going up.


The music was a blur. There was too much turmoil going on around me,
invading my space and invading my mind. With clenched fists, I stamped
my foot and spat several times upon the floor. ‘Take her out of here, Mrs
Williams,’ said Mr Willoughby, the teacher. ‘I am afraid she is not ready
yet. Bring her back in a couple of years.’


Ashamed, my mother's dreams and hopes exploded in her own face. I
was looking at the floor. My arm was being tugged violently. I was looking
up. Words poured out of her mouth; the tone was deadly. ‘That's it. You're
going to a home.’


The hysterics went on in my head and probably spewed forth into the
car, though I was not aware. Willie never made it as a ballerina.


My mother began to see me, not as herself any more, but as her spoilt
sister. I became ‘Marion’ and, as if to stress her hatred, this came to be
‘Maggots’, and over the years I became Maggots.


<i>I see that girl in the mirror, looking back at me.<br />
I see her thinking I am crazy, for believing I am free.<br />
Yet I can see it in her eyes that as I am staring,<br />
She's trying to understand that I am not lying,<br />
I am just trying to find my way hack home to me</i>.

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was a park at the end of our street, and there were roses on the
way. There were houses, and every one of them had a special name.
The house on the end was the ‘Rose House’.


I'd leave the house in the early dawn and go exploring. I'd watch the
fish in Mr Smith's fish-pond, peer through the glass doors at the back of
the rose lady's house, dance in their gardens, singing songs or reciting
poems I'd picked up. I'd eat Lina's mother's pot-plants and throw the rose
lady's rose petals high into the air and walk through them as though they
were the stars around my bed. Perhaps I was an angel to watch, but I was a
devil to try to be with. The rose lady never told me off for the roses.
Someone once commented on my singing. Then I stopped singing in front
of people, although I didn't realize for many years that they could still hear
me even if I couldn't see them.


The park was a magical place. I would lie in the middle of the seesaw,
making it tip up and down. On the swing I could make Lina's backyard
appear and disappear, which made me laugh. Sometimes she would
come outside and see me. She would come to the park or ask me to come
over. I would laugh and keep swinging higher and higher. Look, no-one
can touch me.


Lina and her mother spoke only Italian, and I loved to hear her and her
mother talk. They had gentle voices; even when authoritative they didn't
sound hard.


I loved the smell of their house, and there were so many things to see
and to see through. Crystal glasses lined polished streaky teak cabinets
and stood upon mirrored shelves as though, deservedly, they were on
stage. The floor was smooth and shiny like silk. It looked good enough to
eat. Everything seemed nice to touch. I'd rub my cheek against the
curtains, the cabinets, the seat covers and the glass door.


Lina's mother thought I was beautiful and fed me pieces of squid. I
liked pieces of squid because I liked Lina's mother. And when she would
laugh her eyes would dance and her whole body seemed to roll with the
laugh.


I liked Lina. She had an older brother who was a bully. I understood
that.

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Lina's mother asked what had happened to her plants; they had had
bites taken out of them. I turned my head away and tried not to laugh. ‘Did
you do that?’ gestured Lina. I looked into her eyes, and my eyes didn't lie.


My favourite tree lived in the park. I would climb it and hang upside
down by my knees and swing, usually from the highest branch I
could find. Sometimes I would sing, sometimes I would hum. As long as
everything moved to the rhythm, I was happy.


One particular day, I was swinging from my tree. A girl approached me
and began to talk to me as I swung. Her name was Carol. I guess I looked
quite strange to her as I was wearing only my white smock-like nightie,
which was falling down over my head, leaving the rest of me exposed. My
face must have shocked her even more, as I had painted it with patterns
using my mother's make-up. I thought I was beautiful. I must have looked
a mess.


Sometimes I would suddenly flip myself out of the tree in some
dramatic final swing. I would let my legs go from the tree and go flying
before landing with a thud upon the ground. Sometimes I would wind
myself. I'd often be scratched. It made no difference. I'd get to my feet and
continue on to the next adventure. Mine was a rich world, but like many
rich people I was very alone.


I went with this giant of a girl. I was fascinated by her animation,
though I hardly understood a word she said. I heard words. I probably
copied them. But only her actions and their ability to capture me had any
significance, and as long as things were new to me I was captured.


We went to Carol's house. She had a mother. Her mother was shocked
about the state of my face. I was surprised by her shock; I thought
the colours were delightful. They were laughing. People often did in my
presence, except my mother.


Later people would say they were laughing with me not at me, but I
wasn't laughing. So I copied them, and made what they said correct. Then
they would laugh at my strange laugh, and I would laugh with them, and

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Carol's mother got a flannel and washed my face and hands and legs.
There I was. All brand-new She placed a drink in front of me. I looked at it,
waiting to be told what to do. ‘You can drink it,’ said a voice. It was a
sentence of words, a statement. I looked at the glass and at the mother and
at the girl. The girl, sitting across the table, lifted her glass and drank. I was
her mirror. I copied her.


‘Where does she live?’ said a voice.


‘I don't know. I found her in the park,’ said another voice.


‘I think you'd better take her back there,’ said the mother.


Fear came and took me away. I stopped being there.


Carol took me by the hand. She led me back to the park. My eyes, like a
camera, captured the moment. She lived in another world within that
house of hers. I wanted so much to be a part of it. I glared at her, betrayed.
The world was throwing me out.


I had discovered choice. I wanted to live in Carol's world, in Carol's
house. ‘Where do you live?’ came her voice as she slipped away from my
reality. I stared it her, I screamed inside with frustration. No sound came
out. I watched the person who had been Carol wave goodbye and say
words. For many years, I had wondered if she were real, for nobody had,
till then, so totally held me within ‘the world’. This stranger, who I only
ever met once, was to change my life. She became ‘the girl in the mirror’.
Later I became Carol.


As I got older, I would compulsively bring home kitten after kitten,
replaying the way Carol had taken me home, and I would wait and wonder
when my mother would become Carol's mother. She never did.


I finally gave up waiting for Carol to come back to the park. I didn't want
to swing from my tree any more. It hurt too much. I began to spend almost
all of my time looking in the mirror.


There was a long mirror in my bedroom. In it's reflection I could see my
brother's bedroom door. My brother never came through this door. I
assume that he either didn't sleep in there or that he made his way out
through the door, leading out on to the back porch. Had he come in there,
I'm sure I would have screamed. My room was my world; my mother,

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the day I wanted the door shut. In the night I wanted it open, to keep
an eye on anything which might enter. Carol came in through the mirror.


Carol looked just like me, but the look in her eyes betrayed her identity,
It was Carol all right. I began to talk to her, and she copied me. I was angry.
I didn't expect her to do that. My expression asked her why, and hers asked
me. I figured that the answer was a secret.


I decided that Carol understood that no-one else was allowed to see me
with her and that this was her way of protecting me. I began to whisper to
her, putting my face very close to hers and wondering why she didn't turn
to hear.


When I was not in front of the mirror, Carol would disappear. I would
feel deserted. When I walked in front of it, she would come back, and I'd
try to look behind the mirror to find if she had gone through the door that
I could see in the background. It wasn't the door to my brother's room
after all. It was Carol's house! The room I saw her in, in the mirror, was
only a room between her world and mine.


Now I understood the secret. If I could get through that room, I could
leave with her, into her world. The only problem was how to get into the
mirror.


I had realized that I had to walk straight into the mirror if I was ever to
get into that room. For the next four years I tried. I would walk straight
into it and wonder why I couldn't get through.


The anxiety of my inner battle was becoming unbearable. I could say
words but wanted to communicate. I wanted to express something. I
wanted to let something out. The anxiety would have been so easy to give
into; whereby I would again lose all awareness of self and my
surroundings.


I would cry and look desperately into Carol's eyes reflected in the
mirror, wanting to know the answers to the way out of my mental prison. I
began to hit myself in frustration -- slapping my face, biting myself and
pulling out my hair. If my mother had not been so good at it, the abuse that
I poured out on myself would have put her efforts to shame.


I eventually believed that it was the resistance I felt just before hitting
the mirror that had stopped me from getting into Carol's world. I realize in
retrospect how true this was. It was certainly some uncontrollable inner
resistance that was stopping me from getting into the world in general.


I began to sit in a huddled ball inside the cupboard. I would close my
eyes and try hard to lose all sensation of my own existence so that I could

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the darkness of that cupboard I found Carol within myself.


Carol was everything that people liked. Carol laughed a lot. Carol
made friends. Carol brought things home. Carol had a mother.


To my mother's delight, Carol could act relatively normal. Smiling,
sociable, giggly, she made the perfect dancing doll, just in time to make Mr
Willoughby's prediction true: ‘Bring her back in a couple of years.’


In the mean time, Donna had disappeared. I was by this time five years
old.


I hated calling anyone else by name, including myself. I never told
them that I believed my name was Carol and that they were playing
characters she met. Fear of betraying the secret was fear of losing the grip
on Carol's world. It was that grip which was my only way out of my inner
prison. I had created an ego detached from the self which was still shackled
by crippled emotions. It became more than an act. It became my life, and as
I had to reject all acknowledgement of an emotional self I had to reject all
acknowledgement of Donna. I eventually lost Donna and became trapped
in a new way. Carol strove for the unacceptable: social acceptance. In
doing so, Carol took the stage. Willie, my other face to the world and the
embodiment of total self control, sat immobilized in the audience. Donna
was still in the cupboard. When I was twenty-two, in search of myself, I
again got into that cupboard and closed the door.

Before Carol came along, I was sent to a special school.


I was three years old, in my prim and proper school uniform -- blue
checkered dress, navy blazer, always buttoned up to keep me in.


I loved the heavy oak doors of the school church, the polished floors,
the coloured glass up so high. I loved the way it all smelled and the trees
that hung over into the playground. I loved cream buns at recess and I
loved Elizabeth's hair. I loved my metal school badge, which was sewn on
to my blazer. Twenty-three years later, I still have it. I take it out from one
of my many tins of treasures and bring back the college as though it were
yesterday. Such treasures were the keys to myself, and God help anyone
who touched them.


This was a private school with a reputation for good one-to-one
attention and a policy of taking ‘special needs’ children. To begin with, the
children were different. Most of them were older than I was. They were
generally quieter and less invasive than other children.


It was thought that I was clever, yet I often didn't understand what was
said to me. Although I was intelligent, I seemed to lack sense. Instead of
talking with people, I would merely mimic them and talk endlessly over
the top of them as though this sufficed for conversation.


I also had problems with people coming near me. I would flinch and
move away. My father blamed my mother. My mother blamed her
treatment of me on my behaviour. My older brother, becoming more and
more fed up with me, called me a spastic. I mirrored his obscene
impersonations. Slap. I learned not to respond at all.


I learned to enjoy doing things at the special school. The teacher would
take us into the school church. A huge sheet of paper would be placed on
the floor. Though I ignored them, there would be one child at each side of
the paper.


We each had a pencil and would draw until finally I would look up at
the face which was joined to the hand which had drawn something into
my picture. The teacher would try to make out figures from the huge
half-scribbled masterpiece we had produced.


Sometimes, I was interested in what the children in the classroom were
making, I would be given some bits. Such things frustrated me. I didn't
mind drawing but I hated trying to put things together to produce people
and the like. I would spend my time making miniature worlds, full of bits
of coloured things and fluff and things that I might get under or climb over
if I could get down into there. I'd put my face down at the level of my
masterpiece, looking into it rather than at it, like a cat into a mouse-hole.

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I never liked to sit on chairs. I had restless legs I couldn't keep still and
they always made it impossible to sit still in a chair. I liked to feel the
ground underneath me. The more of me that was on it, the better. But one
day I got up on to the seat next to a big girl named Elizabeth. She was
making a person out of a cardboard cone and paper. I was intrigued by her
hair, which was pulled back into a long plait. I ran my hand down her plait.
She looked around at me and I was frightened by the way that her face was
joined to her hair. I had wanted to touch her hair, not her. She told me that
her name was Elizabeth. It was the first time that I could remember
reaching out to touch someone gently, even if it was only her hair.


My mother would pick me up from the special school. I would always
wave goodbye to the building. One day I waved goodbye to it for good.
I'm told that a girl with cerebral palsy had hit me on the head with a rock.
Perhaps she did. I was so oblivious to anything which didn't intrigue or
disturb me that I didn't notice. It certainly didn't hurt my feelings, physical
or otherwise.


By the time I had left this special school, I had begun to become Carol.
Carol spoke to people. I learned to talk at people. People probably thought
that the special school had done me some good. It probably had. It
certainly did me no harm.


I started at a regular primary school and ballet classes at the same time. I
had become very good at being told what to do as this was what people
liked and people liked Carol. Being double-jointed, I could tie myself up
into knots, which made people laugh, impressed them and made my
mother proud of the ability of her dancing doll.


My mother had outdone her older sister. She had a dancing doll; her
sister had only boys. My mother would twist and pull and damn near
break my legs off, getting me to do the splits or bend over backwards. My
brother would enthusiastically hold one of my legs, and as I laid on the
floor they would make me into a human clock. Just like Carol, if they
laughed, I laughed. They must have thought I was having a great time. Not
only did they have a dancing doll; they now had a contortionist. What
talent, what ability, what competition! I became the prized showpiece.
Dance, little dancing doll. By the age of eleven, I was on painkillers for
rheumatism which I had developed in every joint of my body. I would
grind my teeth and punch myself to kill the pain. It felt like my bones were

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At this primary school I learned to call myself mad. In my search for
myself, when I was twenty-two I returned to the house I had grown
up in. The woman there showed me something she had discovered written
on the wall of my grandfather's shed. I remembered when I had written it.
It was after my grandfather died. I was about six. It read: ‘Donna is a nut.’
Strangely, it took me four more years to realize that normal children refer
to themselves as ‘I’.


Whether other children were my friends was irrelevant. My first chosen
school-friend was Sandra. I liked her smiling face, and she had dark
shining hair. She was a big girl and she was jolly. Other children teased her.
She became, in her words, ‘my best buddy, old chum’.


Other children played school, mothers and fathers, doctors, and nurses.
Other children skipped ropes and played with balls or swap-cards. I had
swap-cards. I gave them away in order to make friends, before learning that
I was supposed to swap them, not give them away.


Sandra and I would play the same game every day. She'd laugh, I'd
laugh, we'd laugh. We'd sit side by side and scream in each other's ear. It
made me laugh because it tickled, and I really didn't care what it was that
she was screaming; she was the first person to play my games.


Through playtime and lunchtime Sandra and I would drink as much
water as we could, until we felt we would bust. We'd choke ourselves until
we turned blue, coughing and struggling to breathe. We would try to push
out eyes in, in order to see colours, and we would scream and scream until
our throats were red raw.


I thought this was great fun. I had discovered that I could share
physical sensation. In the company of others my senses would cut off, and
I would become so numb that, in order to experience something, I had to
push myself to extreme limits.


Sandra found another friend. I called her fat; she called me mad.
Together, she and her new friend tried to include me. I did not know how
to cope with having two friends at once. I solved the situation by rejecting
them both.


I often played alone on the monkey bars, looking at my cards, climbing
trees, pulling flowers apart, spinning around and around as I stared up into

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Other children were attracted to me. They would watch me in
fascination, walking across the top of the monkey bars, swinging from a
tree branch thirty feet up; in short, doing ‘mad’ things.


Though we went to the same school, my brother had nothing to do
with me. Where he had once been protective towards me, I was now a nut,
a spastic and an embarrassment. I really do not blame him. Just as I lived in
my own world, he was doing fine in ‘the real world’.


Classes seemed to be an extension of the playground, and the
playground seemed to be an extension of the classes. The teacher soon
learned not to let me go to the toilet by myself as I often wandered off and
did not come back.


I'd be out in the playground enjoying myself. It seemed quite natural to
me that if I did not like something I could find a way to avoid it. Looking
back, I can imagine how strange it was for my teacher to be called out to
the playground as one of her pupils was swinging and singing ‘On Top of
the World’ as I hung by my knees from the top of one of the school's
highest trees.


Everyone had gathered down below me. They shouted. I sang louder
and louder and swung higher and higher. Finally I sensed their urgency
and I got scared. Fearfully I climbed down. I still do not know if it was my
actions which frightened me or the fear that someone might come up and
get me. The teacher reassured me that I was not in trouble. Finally I came
down. In dreams I replayed that day of defeat many times.


After one week at primary school I was taken out of my class and with
four other children, placed in a special class called the ‘Country Infant
Room’. These children had been selected from various other classes and,
while these other classes changed rooms, pupils and teachers each year, we
were stuck with one another for the next three years. My teacher was a
hard woman, perhaps for the same reason as my mother. She, too, was the
mother of an unusual child.


The children in this class had special treatment, of sorts. Every so often
some of us would go to Psych and Guidance. I remember very little of this.
I remember the room, but the happenings obviously did not interest me.

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My progress at school was not too bad. I loved letters and learned
them quickly. Fascinated by the way they fitted together into words,
I learned those, too.


My reading was very good, but I had merely found a more socially
acceptable way of listening to the sound of my own voice. Though I could
read a story without difficulty, it was always the pictures from which I
understood the content. Reading aloud, I would confidently continue,
despite mispronouncing or inverting some of the letters or words. I would
use different types of intonation to make the story sound interesting,
though I was merely experimenting with my own voice, and my tone
probably did not match the content of the story half the time.


My spelling was quite good. I had grasped phonetics well and had
memorized the difficult words, so I appeared to be quite clever. My writing
was poor and, despite practice, always remained behind the progress of the
others year after year.


As for maths, I would have done a lot better had my teacher given me
numbers instead of coloured rods. Each rod was a different colour and
length, and represented a different number. To me, they represented
building blocks, and I would stubbornly insist on building towers with
them, spiralling upwards till only one of the smallest pieces would fit on
top. Then I'd knock it down and start again.


Though I could add and subtract, I found fractions impossible. The
concept of halves and quarters was lost on me. I finally found a way to
understand them by some sort of translation via my understanding of
subtraction. I may have found it hard to grasp complexities, but my
methods of trying were nothing if not complex.


As for participation, I participated too much but never in the right
ways. I chattered incessantly to myself, annoying everyone else. People
said that I simply loved the sound of my own voice. They were probably
right. I could sing, yet I would not sing with the others. I would mouth the
words. Ten years later I would sing in the back row of my maths class but I
never sang during music lessons.

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Shelly was in my class. Every year she'd have a birthday party, and every
year her mother would charitably invite me.


Kathleen was in one of the other classes. Every year she'd tell me that I
was either tenth or fourth on the replacement-list for her birthday party.
Every year I got my hopes up. Every year Kathleen's friends would show
up and she'd need no replacements.


Kay was from my neighbourhood. She was probably the most popular
girl in our year. She'd line up her friends and say: ‘You're my first best
friend; you're my second best...’ I was twenty-second. A quiet Yugoslavian
girl was last. I was pretty, I was cheerful and sometimes I was entertaining,
but I did not know how to play <i>with</i> children. At most, I knew how to
create very simple games or adventures and sometimes allow others to
participate, as long as it was totally on my terms.


When I was six my little brother was born.


Tom was unexpected, especially in view of the fact that it was
thought that my mother could have no more children. Although I avoided
looking at other people, I would look into his baby eyes with no resistance.
I talked at him, did magic tricks to entertain him and tried to teach him
how to walk. I felt he was on my side and, given his behaviour, perhaps I
sensed something.


Tom was a headbanger. His only solace seemed to be banging his head
against the wall. When he wasn't doing this, he was tearing around the
house like a miniature tornado.


By the time Tom was two he could dismantle and demolish anything
he laid his hands on at a speed that would put some adults to shame.


Tom liked the games we played, spinning around and around, falling to
the ground and watching the world spin. He loved jumping with me on
every bed in the house. Sometimes we would lie down head first and come
thumping down the stairs, our heads hitting every step, upside down, until
we crashed to the bottom. We would play with his blocks, separating all
the letters out into categories. And Tom loved jigsaw puzzles. He
progressed so quickly through these that he was able to do adult ones by
the time he was four.


Tom spoke freely from an early age, though he spoke with a strange
pronunciation and a strange accent and everyone was someone or other
‘boy’. I was ‘Da boy’; even my father was ‘Arkie boy’. Though we were

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At two Tom was seen by a psychiatrist and said to be the worst case of
hyperactivity they had ever seen. I thought he was quite normal. The
crèche refused to keep him as he was too much to handle.


Like me, Tom took to music like a maestro and, almost compulsively,
could teach himself anything to perfection, though he could not be
taught. I thank God for Tom; though he escaped a lot of the abuse and
name-calling, he moved in my world.


I was seven when we moved to the big house. It was like a haunted house
when we first moved in. (The previous occupant had died.)


At the new house Tom became haunted by two friends, which terrified
him. There was ‘Mr Leg’ and the ‘Big Ans’, which was later ‘The Big
Hands’. It seems I'd told him they lived up the stairs to my room. Although
my little brother was my best friend, not even he had the right to trespass
or touch anything in or near my room. Tom had to pass the stairs to go to
the bathroom. His fear made this near-impossible.


My mother turned this, her new prison, into a doll's house. I lived in the
attic. After the first few weeks in that house, they put bars on the window.
It seemed I was to become the loony who lived in the attic. I certainly acted
like one. As I struggled year after year with trying to join ‘the world’ and
finding myself compelled to withdraw into my own, I'd stand at the
window, pushing my face into the bars and dropping objects ‘to freedom’,
distraught if they landed in the guttering, yet glad because no-one would
see them and know what I felt. That summed up my dilemma really;
everything was a double bind.


Around this time I was again tested for partial deafness, for although I
could speak I often didn't use language in the same way as others and
often got no meaning out of what was said to me. Although words are symbols,
it would be misleading to say that I did not understand symbols. I had
a whole system of relating which I considered ‘my language’. It was other

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I met Trish she was behind bars, too. I had tried walking home
from school down Martin Street, but the trees frightened me. They
were the type that dropped all of their leaves and stuck out of the ground
like huge knobbly hands with long crooked forbidding fingers. Though
they had no leaves, their character seemed to dominate the whole street so
that it always seemed to be full of shadows. The footpath had strangely
laid out paving stones, so that it took a lot of concentration to make sure
you did not step on any of the lines. I hated Martin Street.


I began to walk up Trish's street instead, and ended up doing so for
years. There were houses with roses in Trish's street. There was always a
trail of rose petals along the footpath after I'd walked home.


One day I stopped and looked at some children behind bars. They
called me over. I asked why they were locked in. I did not seem to realize
that they were simply in their grandmother's backyard which just
happened to be closed off by a tall black cast-iron gate.


Trish had just moved to our school. She was a quiet, shy and gentle girl
with a very simple nature. She was also the eldest of three children.


Although I was always either indifferent or controlling, I felt secure in
the belief that Trish was my older sister. We hung about together at school.
I showed her how to rub her eyes and look into the sunlight to see colours.
She shared her grandmother's marvellous home-made cakes and found
someone she could talk to. Though I listened, I often did not hear, but I
liked Trish, so I'd look straight at her and she did not seem to notice. I was
her best friend, and she became my proof that I was capable of having one.


Mostly, we would ride bicycles, play in the park, play word games and
talk about the things we would like to have. I would sing and dance and
play with my shadow. She would sit and watch me and laugh. I didn't
mind. I liked Trish.

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went to stay at Trish's place for a couple of weeks. I had my little
suitcase, and Trish had loaned me one of her teddies.


The first night there we laughed and giggled and made up funny names
for things. Trish's mother told us to go to sleep. Trish cuddled her teddy,
and I lay next to the one she had given me.


‘I'm scared, Trish,’ I told her. ‘I don't want to go home but I don't want
to stay here.’ She offered to let me sleep in her bed.


People had long since given up trying to cuddle me, but I wanted to be
like Trish. I got into Trish's bed as though I was her. She cuddled me like
her teddy bear. I was terrified. It seemed tears were welling up from a part
of me long buried and forgotten.


We were two seven-year-old girls; one taking the comfort of hugging
for granted, the other rigidly tolerating it, finding it terrifying and
excluding.


Trish's mother came into the room to check on the sleeping girls.


‘What are you two both doing in the same bed? Come on, Donna, back
to your own bed,’ she said.


‘Good night,’ said a sleepy Trish.


‘Good night,’ I echoed shakily.


For many years after that I had the habit of lifting the blankets and
inviting in any strangers my sleeping ears had heard enter my room. I had
become Trish.


I lay back in my own bed in Trish's room on that occasion, trying to be
as neat as possible. I had begun by neatly rearranging the bed around my
body, which I'd placed as perfectly in the middle as I could estimate. I had
my arms over the covers, rigidly by my sides; a perfect picture of ‘neat’.


I decided that I was taking up too much space in the bed. I moved
myself over to the side of the bed and eventually got down into the
tucked-in blankets, as though I was a piece of clothing which needed
hanging up.


I was making too much mess. I got out of bed and sat on the side of it. I
was taking up too much space. I sat on the tiniest edge of the end corner. I
looked untidy in my nightie; I had to get dressed. I dressed myself for the
next day, looking at the Venetian blinds in the darkness, hoping the light
would come soon.


The clothes I'd brought were not neat enough. I folded them all, trying
to be as silent as possible, and repacked my case, placing it next to my legs
which dangled to the floor at the corner of the bed. I looked at Trish and
wished that she was like me, and then I wished so much that I was like her.

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Trish's mother entered the room.


‘Donna, is that you? What on earth are you doing? You silly girl. What's
wrong? Come on, hop back into bed. Why were you sitting there?’ she
said.


‘I don't want to go home,’ I said in a whisper.


‘You don't have to,’ said Trish's mother.


‘I don't want to stay here,’ I whispered.


‘Where do you want to go?’ said Trish's mother.


‘I want to go,’ I repeated.


‘You can't go, Donna; there is <i>nowhere</i> to go,’ she explained.


‘Nowhere to go, nowhere to go, nowhere to go,’ I said over and over in
my head, trying to understand the words, which my feelings obviously did
not acknowledge.


Trish's mother helped me to get back into my nightie. I complied like a
robot, hypnotized by my mind's repetition of the words ‘nowhere to go’. If
anything I'd ever heard summed up the nature of the trap I was in, those
words captured it like Shakespeare.


Trish slowly disappeared from my awareness, but she had been the
cause of a dream which was to be repeated over and over for the next
fifteen years. When I was twenty-two, I woke up terrified and frozen,
staring at the Venetian blinds in my friend's room. Such simple things left
such a long-term impact.


I had stayed away from home on many occasions by the time I was
seven, but never had it affected me so emotionally. I'd been brutally
exposed to my own vulnerability in a world I found foreign and
unreachable. I became angry at my innocence and naïveté. Willie took the
stage as the curtain went down on the first compromise I'd found between
Donna and Carol: the dancing doll.


Terry lived around the corner. She was older than I was and she was Italian.
I was eight. She was ten. I used to watch her. She used to watch me
watching her.


I did not know how to make friends, so I would stand there calling this
girl every four-letter word I knew. As my mother had a huge vocabulary of
swearwords, I did this pretty well. Eventually this girl would take to her

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One day she caught me. She was about to ‘smash my face in’, when she
decided at least to ask me why I had tormented her so persistently for so
long.


‘I wanted to be your friend,’ I blurted out furiously.


‘You're mad,’ she said with disgust. ‘Why didn't you just try to talk, like
normal people?’ she asked.


Knowing what I know now, I would have answered: ‘Because I'm not
"normal people".’ We became best friends.


Terry was into smoking, learning new swearwords, talking about boys
and interested in my brother. I wanted somewhere to go, something to do
and to be free of the painful accusation that I had no friends.


She would take me to the Hogans' backyard. They owned a wood-yard,
and we'd sit among the wood. I was eight years old. I coughed and choked
and learned to smoke cigarettes, as I learned to be Terry. Terry found me
amusing; I was probably the cheekiest and rudest child she'd ever met. My
little brother and I went about swearing at, questioning and defying
anything and everything.


Terry would go inside for lunch. I'd sit, legs dangling into the gutter,
glaring defiantly at her house from across the road. I never felt as though I
was missing out on lunch because I rarely felt hunger. The only thing I was
missing was inclusion, and when I wanted this I wanted it on my terms
only to throw away at some later date, as though friendship was an apple
gone bad.


I was as obsessive about my friendship with Terry as I was about any
friendship. They were always exclusive and excluding. If other children
were included, I either took the stage or, most often, bowed out. Terry had
become my entire world. We spent almost every available moment
together, playing with her cats, collecting bits and pieces from garbage
collections, taking trams and buses out to explore different suburbs.


Terry's mother liked me, and I was her daughter's excuse for getting out
of doing housework or looking after the younger children. As I had
echoed English, so I echoed Italian. Standing in the front yard of their
house I'd cheekily parrot the commands this mother gave her children,
with the mother's inflection and pronunciation.

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At home there was a constant war raging around me. My father was living
in the fast lane, and every step he took in independence was another
footprint upon my mother's face. When he came home there was
war. It got worse when my father's version of compromise was to set this
fast lane on a collision course with the front door of our house, and the
house became a hum of constant drunken parties and the ensuing brawls.


I had always accepted my mother's violence towards me. Somehow it
did not seem to matter too much. After all, it was only my body. Perhaps, in
some perverse way, these extremes were the only physical sensation I could
feel <i>without</i> being hurt. Gentleness, kindness and affection terrified me
and, at the very least, made me very uncomfortable. My mother used to
say: ‘If you really want to hurt someone, be nice to them.’ Perhaps she had
learned that lesson from watching the way it often affected me. If this came
from her own experience, God help her.


I decided to go and live at Terry's house. I would wait until about one
o'clock in the morning and then sneak out, leaving the door unlocked
so that I could sneak back in by about six, before anyone woke up.


Around the corner at Terry's, I would creep quietly around the back,
where I would throw stones at her bedroom window as she'd shown me,
and she would let me in. I'd climb up into the top bunk with her and,
secure with my chosen ten-year-old mother, I'd fall asleep. Waking up at
dawn was no problem. Quite the contrary, I always woke up at this hour
and often still do.


One night Terry's mother was waiting to greet me at the back door. I
was petrified. She looked terribly stern, and I thought she was going to
send me home. Her daughter stood beside her looking guilty. From the
Italian, her daughter translated: ‘My mother says that if you want to come
around here to sleep you must come at a decent hour so that you will not
wake the other children up.’ I was over the moon. I was so excited that I
could not sleep.Heading out the door of my own place, I simply told my
mother I was going around the corner to sleep. Every few nights, I'd go
back to my parents’ house and lay rigidly in my bed in my pretty prison in
the attic and stare at the ceiling until my mind went to sleep.


<i>Shattered dreams, broken glass,<br />
Echoes of a shattered past</i>,

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is hard to say whether the violence of my family made me the way I
was. What I do know is that I never replayed their violence over and
over in my mind until I was much older.


Though I was very much a part of it, it is hard to tell whether I helped
shape their situation or they helped to shape mine. As a child, the things
that disturbed me, the events that shattered the security of ‘my little world’
and caused me to play them over and over again in my mind, were events to
do with the disturbing nature of that which others take for granted:
kindness, understanding and love.


I could comprehend the actions of another person, particularly if they
were extreme, but I had trouble coping with ‘whole people’ -- their
motivations and expectations, particularly to do with giving and
receiving.


With violence, I knew where I stood. To call it the result of ‘baser’
emotions must be true, for I certainly found it easier to grasp. Niceness is
far more subtle and confusing. Most children learn to welcome it and
accept it. By the time I realized it was there, it came as a disruption that I
was never quite prepared for. Possibly such preparation closes love out, but
I always panicked without such preparation. I'd panic and be in a state of
shock. People would try to comfort me. Comforting either annoyed me or
hurt me. I guess I was not ‘most children’.


When I was aware enough of the world around me to notice my father's
violence, I found that it did hurt. My father hardly ever laid a
hand on me, but I was very disturbed by the person I saw he could be.
More than anything, I was torn apart by the terror and hysterics of the person
who could most get through to me: my little brother.


Regardless of what else he'd do, the most disturbing thing was the
noise and the sound of smashing glass.

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The house seemed full of colours, and everything seemed to move too
fast to make out, but I would always make all the right moves. I suppose it's
like a person in a state of shock who does not remember how, but functions
with great ability. Perhaps this is comparable with where I was most of the
time.


Colours and things and people would fly doors would get kicked in,
and sometimes faces would too. But it was never ‘whole people’, only their
pieces. The pretty things that got smashed seemed to be a greater tragedy
than what was happening to the people.


Tom would scream. His face my mirror, I'd scream. No sound would
come out. I'd pick up my little brother and get into the cupboard, my
hands over his mouth, my arms closing out the sound from his ears. I'd feel
his tears and his runny nose over my hands. My eyes were dry. He made me
feel emotions and still had the decency to express them for me. More than
anything else, my little brother frightened me by making me feel real.


I began to reject Tom. I had become his whole world. Whenever I left
him, he would cling to my leg, crying: ‘No, Da. No, Da. Please don't go.’ I
would keep walking, dragging him along like a sobbing dead weight. No
matter what I said, he'd take it to heart. Perhaps it was the first time anyone
had taken me seriously.


Tom began to sleep with the dog, a three-year-old boy curled up with
his bottle on a flea-ridden rug with a male Great Dane for a mother. It was
as though I'd died. Two years later the dog went. It was as though Tom
died at the same time.


I decided that I wanted to go to Terry's school. I had no friends at my
own school and I felt Terry would always look after me. I refused to go
to my usual school, and my mother had no choice but to send me along
with Terry and the others if I was going to attend school at all.


The classroom atmosphere at Terry's school was chillingly cold. My
teacher was a knobbly snapping old goblin who got very angry with me
and kept shouting that I was giving him ulcers. He would make me stand
in the rubbish-bin, and I would swear and he would throw pieces of chalk
at me. The children in the class would laugh. This time I didn't.


Terry had her own group of friends and, being two years older than I
was, she had no intention of giving them up to hang around with ‘a child’.

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went around the school for weeks asking everyone I came across if
they were my friend.


‘But I don't know you,’ most replied.


‘But if you did,’ I would persist, ‘would you be my friend?’


Eventually I gave up and sat in a corner of the school grounds, against
the back fence. After a few months two girls decided they would let me
hang around with them. The things they talked about bored me. I
mentally drifted away from them and soon they, too, drifted away from me.
I fell into a deep depression which lasted about a year.


I returned to my old school but hung about on the outside of any groups
which tried to involve me. I stopped smiling and laughing, and the efforts
to involve me only hurt me more, till I'd stand there with tears silently
rolling down my face. At home I'd go up to my room and cry, saying over
and over again. ‘I want to die.’


Terry came round to the house sporadically, and sometimes I'd go
around there, but I was becoming more and more distant and finding it
harder and harder to relate.


I had begun to walk about the house like something returned from the
dead -- shoulders hunched, head bent, looking at my feet wherever I went.
People would ask me what was wrong. I'd paint a smile across my face and
try to impersonate my version of happy. ‘Nothing's wrong,’ I'd tell them in
as short an answer as possible.


At this point I was as fragile as I'd ever been. If I had received a lot of
love and attention at that point, I would probably have felt that it would
kill me.


My mother tried, in the only way she knew. She bought me things. She
began to bring me home pot-plants. I would look at them and look at them
and wonder: Why?


She brought me home a budgerigar she had got at the market pet-shop.
She told me that it was ‘spastic’ and that it would not live long but she
thought I might like to have it until it died. It certainly was deformed. Its
wings seemed somehow back to front. It could not fly, but could only hop;
and, like she said, it died after a few weeks. Appropriately I cried.


She brought me home the prettiest thing I thought I had ever had. It
was a mother-of-pearl china dish with a matching lid, upon which sat an
angel gazing into space.

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She bought me a doll's pram. I ventured outside my room with it.
Dragging it repetitively up and down the stairs I went, without much
interest in what I was doing. I was acting normal, wasn't I?


My mother did not think so. Furious, she came storming up the stairs. I
stood watching her, terrified. She picked up the lid to the coloured china
dish and smashed it on the floor. The angel lay in scattered pieces. My
mother spat out words. I was to be locked in my room without anything
but bread and water until she decided when I could come out. She left,
slamming the door near off its hinges.


As if to prove the point, she returned with a jug of water and a glass. I
lay face-down on my purple-coloured bed in the violently purple-coloured
room and screamed into my pillow, drowning out all the noise
around me. My mother left without closing the door.


I knew that my father had come home. I had been listening to the noises
downstairs. I figured that they were talking about me.


I knew my father would feel sorry for me. I looked at the broken china
on the floor through a misty wall of tears, and cut lines into my face in
anger at the injustice of what had happened. I had cut my cheeks, my
forehead and my chin. With nothing to lose, I calmly walked downstairs to
make my silent statement. ‘Oh my God,’ said my mother, like some slow
deliberate line from a horror film, ‘she's fucking mad.’ The look on her
face was one of complete shock rather than of concern. I was, by this time,
nine years old and very close to being sent to a mental hospital.


Inside my head, what I was doing was completely sane. I didn't know
how to cry out for understanding. I was lost and trapped, and I was making
a statement. I think my mother at least understood the severity of the
situation; she gave up on the bread-and-water idea.


My father's eyes seemed to be crying out to reach me. It seemed he
understood but, like me, either could not put it into words, was not
‘allowed’ to or realized that some things are better expressed without
them.

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had a lot of cousins, and we often stayed at each other's house. I liked a
few of them but I hated Michelle. Nevertheless, Michelle wanted to stay,
and I made no objections.


Michelle and Terry got along like a house on fire. Not knowing how to
cope with more than one person at a time, I told them I wanted to be on my
own. They went off to play.


I never spoke to Terry again. She had been my only friend for over two
years, and as she stood there asking me ‘Why?’ I stared back at her blankly
as though she was playing some curious scene from a silent movie, the
content of which was beyond my grasp. ‘I don't understand you,’ she said.
‘What did I do wrong?’


A few years later Terry ended up working in the shop down the road.
When she spoke to me I still ignored her; when she looked at me I still
looked away. ‘You're mad, you know that, Donna,’ she once said, trying to
get a reaction. I looked up and glared viciously at her.


About a year later Terry's best friend was killed whilst crossing the road
with her. She had watched her die after being hit by a truck. She came
around to the house and told my mother as I stood nearby listening. She
was reaching out for a desperately needed friend. I hadn't yet found out
how to give second chances or try again. I ignored her.


Ten years later, trying to piece my life together, I arrived on Terry's
doorstep. She greeted me and offered me her friendship as though my ten
years of silence had made no difference, though she said: ‘You're the
strangest person. I've never met anyone who ever did that. One day you
were talking to me; the next day it was as though we'd never been friends.’
She never knew how much I sometimes needed her, or how important it
was for me to close her out, and I never told her.


I had begun, long ago, to plan leaving home for good. I thought that I
would live in the lane behind our house, where I would sleep in the long
grass and live on plums which hung over the fences. I still felt responsible
for my little brother and I began to prepare him for when I left for good.


I began to tuck Tom into bed and tell him stories. The stories I told him,
however, were not the fantasy stories children are usually told. I presented
him with situations he might face and how he could close them out and
avoid being affected by them.

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I taught Tom about singing a tune over and over in his head, if what he
was hearing hurt. I taught him about looking straight through people,
even if you had to look into their eyes to convince them you were listening.
I taught him about jumping up and down as he recited things in order to
learn them and I taught him about losing himself in the spots. We began
with a dot on the wall and worked our way up.


Tom was probably relearning tactics he had already used. He certainly
didn't find much of what I was teaching him very new. Still, he was
learning how to cope. In the mean time, through teaching him, I was
becoming more and more aware of my own type of behaviour-why I did
things and what I got out of them. I also told Tom that I'd be leaving home
one day, and he had told my mother.


For the last few years my mother had not been as systematically violent
as she had been before I started school. However, the more she realized
that I intended to leave home, the more she tried to convince me, not of her
understanding, but of her power over me.


My mother was also becoming aware that I was approaching puberty,
which posed major problems for her ability to cope.


Every day she would either give me the graphic details about some
horrible experience she had had with men, tell me how she had been
robbed of a life by having children, or tell me there was no way I was going
anywhere; she would keep me at home as long as she liked. Any defiance
on my part, from the way I stood to the look in my eyes, was met with
violence, intended to crush my will. What had happened to her little
dancing doll?


I had given up on staying at Terry's school and returned to my old school
again. By this time, I was so withdrawn that I had little idea of what was
going on around me. As I emerged, it was once again an emergence into a
world of things. I became fascinated with words and books, and making
outside order out of inner chaos.

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was only one thing that my mother and I would do together:
play Scrabble. It was, I suppose, good for adding to my trivial collection of
words; words which sounded nice, words which I said over and over,
words belonging to brands of things (their real names, not just the noun
for what they were).


My mother used her understanding of words to read horrific murder
novels which she would get through like lightning. I used to read, too. I
read telephone books and street directories.


I eventually realized that I wasn't getting anything out of the novels I
was being made to read at school. I could read them all right, but I was
unable to pick up what the book was about. It was as though the meaning
got lost in the jumble of trivial words. Like a person learns to speed-read, I
would read only the main words in any sentence and tried to let the feel of
the book somehow wash over me. It worked to an extent. Instead of
accomplishing the task of thoroughly reading a book and gaining nothing
in terms of content, I was now able to scan one rather than read it and be
aware of the names of some of the characters and some of the things that
happened to them.


It was as though, if I concentrated too hard, nothing would really sink
in. Unless the task was something which I chose, I would drift off, no
matter how hard I tried to be alert. Learning, unless it was something I
sought and taught myself, became closed out and hard to comprehend just
like any other intrusion from ‘the world’.


I loved to copy, create and order things. I loved our set of encyclopaedias.
They had letters and numbers on the side, and I was always checking to
make sure they were in order or putting them that way. I was making order
out of chaos.


I loved collections of things and would bring home library books on
the many different types of cat, bird, flower, house, work of art -- in fact
anything that belonged to the one group. My projects at school were like
this, too. If we were, for example, asked to write about cows, I'd produce a
chart, complete with detailed drawings, specifying every type of cow. My
interest may have been repetitive and lacking in creativity, but I was taking
a renewed interest in my surroundings. This was a phase I always
compared with ‘waking from the dead’. Such tiny steps were always great
achievements.

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I loved to read telephone books. I had learned how to make free telephone
calls from the phone box around the corner and would systematically
go through the telephone-book, phoning the first and last name
listed under each letter. I would explain that I was phoning them because
they were the first A, last B and so on. Usually they would hang up; sometimes
they would tell me off; but, like anything, once started I had to finish.
The important thing was that I had moved from things to
communication with people. The telephone box was my conveniently impersonal
classroom.


Occasionally I would get some talkative old person on the phone and I
would talk away like a firecracker gone off and they could hardly get a
word in edgeways.


Searching for categories did not stop with the encyclopedias. I would
read the telephone directory, counting the number of Browns listed, or
counting the number of variations on a particular name or the rarity of
others. I was exploring the concept of consistency.


I would walk about the house proudly spouting my latest discovery in
the phone book. I could not understand why such things bored people
stupid. I guess they had already grasped the concept.


My fascination for street directories took on a new dimension. I was
moving forward from things to communication to attachment.


I began to bring home stray cats and kittens, just as Carol had brought
me to her house all those years ago. I began to name them after the street
names I had liked in the index of the directory -- Beckett after Beckett
Street, Dandy after Dandy Street. It was important that I did this in
alphabetical order, as though I was mirroring my own systematic
self-development.


Though I could neither apply myself at school nor be told what to do, I
was motivated, persistent, orderly and systematic about that which may
have held the attention of someone else for a few minutes at the most. It
may have seemed that my world was upside down, but I was looking to get
a grip on consistency. The constant change of most things never seemed to
give me any chance to prepare myself for them. Because of this I found
pleasure and comfort in doing the same things over and over again.

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I always loved the saying, ‘Stop the world, I want to get off.’ Perhaps I'd
been caught up in the spots and the stars at a time when other children
kept developing and so I had been left behind. The stress of trying to catch
up and keep up often became too much, and I found myself trying to slow
everything down and take some time out. Something would always call
me back.


Perhaps I did not lack the feeling of hunger, or needing to go to the
toilet, needing to sleep. Perhaps my preoccupation with remaining a step
away from fully conscious made it necessary for my mind to deny the
awareness of these needs; certainly I would ignore the signs, feeling faint,
anxious or grumpy, yet always too busy to stop for such things.


Though the feeling which precipitated my ‘losing myself’ happened
most often, beyond my control, I found I could either give into it or try to
fight it. It was hypnotic, and I often found myself giving in to it and
sometimes sought the feeling when it wasn't there. It was as though I was
hooked on this state of being.


One of the ways of making things seem to slow down was to blink or to
turn the lights on and off really fast. If you blinked really fast, people
behaved like in old frame-by-frame movies; like the effect of strobe lights
without the control being taken out of your hands.


If anything, my blinking was sometimes a reaction to sound. If the tone
of someone's voice disturbed me, off I would go. Similarly I would turn the
sound up and down on the television, breaking up their voices but happy
to watch the picture, or intermittently block my ears off. This seemed to
imitate the difficulty I sometimes had hearing people consistently.


I talked compulsively when I was nervous. I also talked to myself
sometimes. One reason for this was that I felt so deaf when I said nothing.
It was as though my senses only functioned consistently when I moved
within my own world, and that meant closing others out. My mother and
father thought I was deaf. Standing behind me, they'd take it in turns to
make loud noises without so much as a blink in response. I was taken to
have my hearing tested. The test showed I wasn't deaf, and that was that.
Years later, I had my hearing tested again. At the time, it was found that my
hearing was better than average, and I was able to hear some frequencies
that only animals normally hear. The problem with my hearing was
obviously one of a fluctuation in the awareness of sound. In this case it was

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One sound, however, which I loved to hear was the sound of anything
metallic. Unfortunately for my mother, our doorbell fell into this category,
and I spent ages obsessively ringing it. After I had copped a bashing for
this, they took out the batteries. However, an obsession is an obsession. I
took the backing plate off the doorbell and continued to set it off
manually from inside the door.


I had begun to feel something was missing but I did not I know what it
was. I had a doll and wanted very much to cut it open to see if it had feelings
inside. I took a knife and tried to prise it open but became afraid of the
consequences of breaking the doll and simply went on wondering for the
next few years.


I was sure that I had feelings, but they did not seem to make the jump in
my communication with others. I began to become increasingly frustrated,
violent and self-destructive. This was made worse by expectations for me
to behave like a young lady. The world around me was becoming as
unforgiving and intolerant as my mother.


I would talk and talk, regardless of whether any of my classmates were
listening or not. The teacher would get louder, and so would I. She would
send me to stand outside the class room. I would go for a walk. She would
tell me to stand in the corner. I would spit and shout: ‘No!’ She would try to
come near me. I would arm myself with a chair like some sort of wild
animal. She would shout. I would bring the chair crashing down or throw
it across the room. I was no young lady.


At home I'd begun to have night terrors. I would be sleep-walking and
wake up in another part of the house, hiding from something in the
room which only my sleeping mind had seen.


I once woke up after being bitten by a beautiful blue-eyed kitten which
had suddenly turned into a rat as I went to pat it. I had, during the
nightmare, gone downstairs and played the scene in the lounge, before

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another night I woke up standing in the wardrobe doorway, rigid with
horror, glaring at a doll which had suddenly returned to normal. Seconds
before, I had seen it, hands outstretched, its lips eerily mouthing words I
could not hear, like some come-to-life scene from a macabre horror film.


I had become literally terrified of falling asleep. I would wait until
everyone was asleep and then, frightening as my mother had become, I
would go into her room and stand there watching her sleep, feeling secure
in the knowledge that if anything was to get me it would have to get her,
too, and she knew how to fight. From sheer tiredness, I began to
hallucinate. Images on the wall would move. Unknown to my mother, I lay
stiff and silent under her bed, almost too afraid even to breathe. Tears
rolled down my face. I made no sound. Like at Trish's house four years
earlier, I lay there in silence and waited for the light to come.


It was my last year in primary school. I was twelve years I old. It was the
seventies, and my new teacher was something of a hippie. His face
seemed to peep out from a bush of bristly hair. He was tall and gangly with
a gentle voice that seemed somehow ‘predictable’.


Mr Reynolds was fairly ‘alternative’, I suppose. He brought in records
and asked us to tell him what we thought the music and songs were saying
to us. What I liked, most of all, was that there were no wrong answers.
Everything was supposed to be only whatever it was to each child.


We would put on plays, and everyone got to do bits of whatever they
chose to do -- setting up props, painting scenery or trying different parts.
Even the audience was made to feel that they had a role to play.


Mr Reynolds never emphasized ability, but instead allowed me to show
him what I was capable of, and he would tell me which things I did better
than others. It was as though the class was his family and he had, for me,
become my new father.


This teacher spent a lot of time with me, trying to understand how I felt
and why I did the things I did. Even when he raised his voice, I could still
sense his gentleness. He was the first teacher at that school to whom I had
made an effort to explain what was happening at home, though I still never

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was the hardest school year I had had up until then. I already had
quite a reputation as a weirdo, and after standing up for two other loners
who were being attacked I, like them, became ‘Zombie’.


Sara was from England. She had the brightest red hair I had ever seen
and nobody could understand a word she said, which was nothing
new to me. Sara's cousin would not play with her as she already had a best
friend and probably did not want to be brought down by playing with
someone the other children rejected.


At the same time a new boy joined our class. He was tall and scrawny,
quiet, withdrawn, and looked a bit haunted. The other children began to
call both of these children ‘Zombie’. Both of these children had no fight in
them, and I, able to identify with how it felt to be tormented, decided that I
was going to be on their side,


The name-calling got out of hand. Perhaps such things had always
been happening around me, but this was the first time I was aware of them.
Other children in my class were calling me ‘Zombie’, too, pushing my
sanity to the limit as they chanted it over and over again.


I watched the other children get violent with these two children,
pulling their hair, pushing, shoving, kicking, punching, all because they
were different. I began to fight back at some of them, trying to kick people
down stairs, hitting them with chairs, slamming fingers under desk-top's
and becoming hard, quiet and brooding.


As the school year ended, my attendance had been poor, as had my
concentration -- as always. Mr Reynolds told me, defeatedly, that he
wondered if I had learned anything at all. He explained how important the
final test was; it was to be the last test I would ever take at this school.


The papers were put in front of us. My answers seemed to come from
nowhere. I certainly had not studied for the test.

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The test results were given out a week later. Christine was thought to be
the smartest girl in the class. She got a score of eighty-three. A boy named
Frank, whose name began with A, had the highest score read out so far, the
prize for which was a scholarship to continue on to secondary school at an
expensive private grammar school. Mr Reynolds got to the W's and
announced that ‘he could not believe it’. I bowed my head in shame,
thinking that I had not done very well. Mr Reynolds announced to the
class that, contrary to all expectation, I had a score of ninety-four.


I had two points less than Frank, but I had achieved the highest score
for any girl in the school. Frank went to the grammar school. I went on to
be a high school dropout three years later. In the mean time, Mr Reynolds
stood there, pleased as Punch, and I had proved that, regardless of
whatever else I was, I was not a ‘retard’.


Mr Reynolds announced in his last week that he was getting married.
Something snapped. I put my head into my desk and slammed the lid
down on my head again and again and again.


The room had become a jumble. I was like a caged animal. I wanted to
run. I ended up in the sickbay, where Mr Reynolds explained to me that his
marriage did not mean that we were losing him and that we were all invited
to the wedding and a big end-of-year party at his house.


I went to the wedding. I sat proudly in the front row, oblivious to the
remarks that this was where the relatives were meant to sit. I was on my
best behaviour. I sat on my own in that front row, said nothing, and waved
to my teacher as he took his vows.


I went to the party. I hung in the background, too shy to take the stage,
and otherwise having no idea what to say. I smiled and tried to look like I
was having fun.


On my last day at the school, a friend and I were hanging about in the
classroom whilst the other children were outside playing. We looked in the
teacher's book which was left sitting on his desk. She read what he had
written about her. I looked up my name under W, and a sentence jumped
out at me from the page: ‘Donna Williams is a disturbed child.’


Mr Reynolds, who had been in the staff room next door, came in and
caught us. He was angry.


‘What do you think you were doing?’ he demanded.


‘Why did you write that about me?’ I asked. ‘What do you mean I am
disturbed?’


‘You had no right to be looking in that book,’ he retorted.

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The report had, it seemed, come from Psych and Guidance. I left that
school torn between resenting him and being confused about the me he
had been able to bring out.


It seemed that the older I got, the more obvious it became that I had trouble
communicating, or perhaps I was just becoming more aware of people's
often ‘concerned’ remarks. The comments of my brother and mother,
however, were born of intolerance and not of concern.


When I was in a talkative mood, I would often talk on and on about
something which interested me. The older I got, the more interested I
became in things and the longer I would go on about them. I really was not
interested in discussing anything; nor did I expect answers or opinions
from the other person, and would often ignore them or talk over them if
they interrupted. The only thing that was important to me was to talk in an
effort to answer <i>my own</i> questions, which I often did.


If I did not know something, I would either pretend I did or convince
myself that I did not care to know. If I had to ask questions, it was as
though I did so to the air. It had been this way as long as I could remember,
and I used to become very frustrated, wanting to know something but
finding it was more of an obstacle to address someone than the question
was worth.


I developed various methods of getting around this problem. At school
I would walk in front of someone to get their attention and then simply
begin to speak on the subject I was concerned about, though usually
finding it too direct to let them know why I was talking about something.
People often ignored my chatter, thinking that I was making a series of
statements rather than asking questions in the only way I could. This was
complicated, I suppose, by the fact that I ignored or spoke over anything
they said in response. Nevertheless it was important for me to know that
they were listening, so I began to open all of my sentences with ‘Hey’ or
‘Y’ know what?’ and to end them with ‘you know?’, ‘right?’ or ‘OK?’
These idiosyncrasies became so predictable that people would make fun of
me, mockingly anticipating my usual beginnings and endings.


It was the same at home. My mother, knowing that it disturbed me,
would sarcastically make me call her ‘Mum’. Under threat of violence, I
would comply, forcing the word out with such hatred that it sounded like I
was swearing. Eventually I would at most call her by her first name.

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Nevertheless, I wanted to know things. I wanted to accumulate
knowledge. In my usual way, I would walk about, talking, trying to attract
attention and going on and on about something in a very indirect way. My
mother called my means of verbal communication ‘wonking’. This was
equivalent in definition, I suppose, to ‘unintelligible mindless babbling’.


For me, this ‘wonking’ was my way of conversing and was certainly not
mindless. It took an incredible degree of courage to seek out an audience
and talk about something I was interested in. To me, this made me
painfully vulnerable. I was expressing something about my own
personality and identity. The fear it inspired would simply not have
allowed me to express anything personal in any other way.


It was as though I had even to trick my own mind by chattering in such
a casual and blasé manner; any other way stopped at the point of
motivation. It was as though I was emotionally constipated and the words
could not otherwise escape my lips. If it were not for the methods I had
devised, my words, like my screams and so many of my tears, would have
remained silent as they did a year later.


People would push me to get to the point. When what I had to say was
negative, this was quite simple. Opinions which had nothing to do with
my own identity or needs rolled off my tongue like wisecracks from a
stand-up comedian.


I remember, when I was about seven, how I got a slap in the face after
walking into someone's house and announcing, ‘It's very dirty in here,’
and following it up by enthusiastically informing the host that he ‘only
had one arm’. This was fairly typical of me, and I came to earn myself a
reputation as rude, hurtful and outspoken. Later this same quality
sometimes came to earn me respect as someone who was ‘never afraid to
say what she thinks’.


Hiding behind the characters of Carol and Willie, I could say what I
thought, but the problem was that I could not say what I felt. One solution
was to become cold and clinical about topics I might feel something about.
Everyone does this to an extent, in order to cover up what they feel, but I
had actually to convince myself about things; it made me a shell of a
person.


These were the same tactics I employed when I found it necessary to
create Carol in order to communicate all those years ago. Deep down,
Donna never learned to communicate. Anything that I felt in the present
still had either to be denied or expressed in a form of conversation others
called waffling, chattering, babbling or ‘wonking’. I called it ‘talking in
poetry’.

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was twelve, and my mother and older brother had embarked on a new
campaign of systematically teasing me. It began with them asking each
other ‘What did she say?’, at which the other would reply: ‘Don't listen to
her; she's wonking again.’


They had thought up a new name for me. I was now ‘a blonk’. This
meant that I was a moron. My brother, secure in the knowledge that I
dared not fight back against my mother’ s ‘pride and joy’, would bring his
face close up to mine, tilting his head from side to side as I did, and
announce ‘wonk, wonk, blonk, blonk’. His proximity deeply disturbed
me, but now so did his words. Perhaps this was because he had invaded my
personal space by putting his face so close to mine as he said this. Perhaps
it was the way he mirrored my habit of tilting my head from one side to the
other when I was trying to understand someone, or the fact he had
employed my tactics of creating ‘special’ words.


Regardless of how he had made me relate to what he had said; visibly
the words had stung. My brother and mother, having got a reaction,
hurtfully persisted as I viciously retorted with ‘I'm not mad!’ till I finally
gave up entirely.


My mother said that I had changed when I was twelve. Never before
had I so strongly had to fight for the comforts of my own world. ‘The
world’ still seemed like either a battlefield or a stage, but I was forced to
keep trying to ‘play the game’, if for no other reason than to survive. I
would have been happy to ‘let go’ and retreat into my own world if not for
my belief that my mother and older brother seemed to thrive on my
strangeness and inability to cope. My hatred and my sense of injustice were
my driving force to prove them wrong. At the same time, my fear of feeling
kept calling me back into myself. Both drives were intense and had a
shattering impact, both on the real feeling me within and the characters
which I threw at those who tried to reach me.

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mother had wanted to send me to a girls' school. I insisted that I
wanted to go to a mixed school or nothing. I went to the mixed
school.


The high school I went to was a rough school in a fairly tough suburb.
Expectations at the school were not high, and I didn't disappoint them. I
was disruptive, bad-mannered and uncooperative. I fitted in well at first.


When I first started at the school, like many other first-year students I
had no friends. It was not long before I attracted other loners. One by one
I'd fight with them and inevitably end up in a brawl. I was earning quite a
reputation as a fighter and a troublemaker, which were the main
ingredients required to make one popular at this sort of school. Not only
did I brawl with any friends I fell out with, I also brawled with anyone
who picked on me or anyone else I felt was getting picked on. Other rough
kids thought I was wild and insane; swearing at the teachers, throwing
things, walking out of school and destroying almost anything I laid my
hands on -- including myself.


I would try to get others to try to shake their hands off their wrists or
shake their heads to hear their brains rattle. I would hold my breath and
tense up my stomach muscles, exerting inner pressure on myself, until, I
turned red, shook and fainted. The other students laughed and called me
crazy. The teacher thought I was badly disturbed. I felt that I had not asked
for ‘their world’, I had no desire to participate in it and, if I had to, it would
be on my terms. I was free either to walk out or to disappear whenever I felt
like it.


In particular, sport was bad news. I hated being in teams or taking sides
or being told what to do. Any efforts to make me toe the line were met
with thrown equipment, which could sometimes be dangerous. One
teacher who was clearly ignorant of the depth of my problems once decided
to ‘teach me a lesson’.


This teacher made me stay back in the changing-room alone with her
and then ordered me to catch the cricket balls she threw at me viciously. I
had always been afraid to catch; I had been hit in, the stomach by the first
one, and then pelted as I ran away from the test like the frightened little
girl that truly was. Her intolerance angered me, the throwing of the balls
frightened me, but strangely her violence didn't hurt my feelings at the
time. Looking back, it almost does.

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Art, pottery and woodwork were a Catch-22. I liked to make things but
didn't like to be shown how, let alone be shown what to make or allow
others to see it.


I liked music, but wouldn't sing; and even being there, given how much
I liked music, made me vulnerable and caused me to misbehave in order to
‘break up’ the class.


I learned to dislike maths as I had always done the working-out in my
head but was now being told to ‘show the working-out’. I simply took the
answers out of the back of the book and transferred them on to the paper
as a compromise.


In English, I would write, though never on the prescribed topic. I'd
spend the time writing evasively about something which disturbed me. I'd
write in such a way that it almost needed to be decoded to be understood
and I would always finish my work off with a lightly pencilled sketch
drawn over the writing, covering the length of the page which, I felt,
would more adequately capture what I was trying to express. The pictures,
too would often be no more than symbolic as anything too personal could
never be seen unless I could create some sort of distance.


Aware of how little I was able to show my true self, I insisted that my
name was not Donna any more and that I was to be called Lee. This
was to signify that they were not communicating with Donna, only with
the characters which I felt they were worthy of: my anger, embodied in
Willie, and my ability to perform and communicate embodied in the emotionless
and empty shell I secretly called Carol. Others were not even worthy
of my explanation which I have kept secret from everyone for
twenty-three years.


Most of the children who knew me refused suddenly to call me Lee
(which was based on my middle name), and I refused cheekily to
acknowledge them. Eventually I developed several nicknames, most of
which I would answer to. As long as they did not insult me by calling me a
name I could not feel, I was happy to pay the price of answering to

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was losing my ability to feel. My own world may have been a void, but
losing my ability to keep grip on it left me unmercifully in some sort of
limbo without any feeling or comfort whatsoever. I, like so many other
‘disturbed’ people, began to hurt myself in order to feel something. It
seemed that other people's ‘normality’ was the road to my insanity. My
ability to close them out kept me sane.

As I was losing, my mother was coming to life. As I began to mature
physically, she was rediscovering her own sexuality. My father stayed
away a lot, and my mother had discovered that she could be a party animal.
She began to get in touch with friends from her teenage years.


The house began to come alive to the sound of rock-and-roll, and the
last thing my mother wanted was a pretty teenage daughter with
behaviour problems.


It seemed that there was- no excuse. As soon as I walked in the door,
home from school, I would be met with punches and kicks, hair-pulling
and harsh words of filth and, as always, I'd never scream.


I had a friend from school whose family, like mine, was in pieces.
Sometimes I would go to stay at her house; sometimes I would be sent.
Sometimes I would not be allowed to stay, and my friend would try to
sneak me in. One night I had to find a place to sleep for myself.


Another girl from school lived a few blocks away. I had gone straight
around to her house when I found I could not stay. I hardly knew her, but
she had taken one of the kittens I had been forced to get a home for before
it got killed by my mother. I interrupted her evening meal to ask her if she
could arrange to let me into her garage to sleep.


It was set. I went round to this girl's house at about 9 pm. I had been
walking around and around and around the street blocks in her

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I found an alleyway and, secure in the duffel coat I wore everywhere,
laid down and tried to sleep. I heard the sound of footsteps and, like
lightning, took to my feet and bolted. It was probably the motorcycle
policeman who had been following me as I walked around the streets.


I considered sleeping in an abandoned house across the road from my
friend's house. People had said it was haunted, and I was too frightened to
stay there.


I sat upon my friend's neighbour's fence. It was two o'clock in the
morning. It was summer in Australia, and people often find it hard to sleep,
including twelve-year-old girls in duffel coats.


A woman walked across the lawn in the darkness towards me. I got up
to run. ‘It's OK,’ she called. ‘I just want to talk to you.’ She seemed so
terribly calm and invited me inside for a cup of tea. In my mind, it was the
fantasy I had been awaiting for almost ten years; she was an imaginary
version of Carol's mother.


‘It's two o'clock in the morning,’ she said casually. ‘Would you like
some cereal?’ I accepted without a thank-you. ‘Would you like to call your
mother and let her know where you are?’ she asked.


‘She knows where I am,’ I replied.


‘How could she know you're here?’ asked the lady. ‘She thinks I am
next door,’ I replied. ‘My friend lives next door.’


‘Then, why aren't you there?’ she enquired.


‘Didn't want me to stay,’ I said.


The lady said I was welcome to stay and showed me to a tiny little green
room with a tilted ceiling and a mirror on the wall. I could have stayed for
ever. Embarrassed, I left the next morning and never saw her again.


Every day I walked home from school through the cemetery. This day I
had decided that I was not going to cry any more. I would go through
the door this time and I would look straight into my mother's eyes and
smile.


The greeting was the same. This time my hair, enmeshed with her
fingers, was being torn out. Time and again my head met the wall with a
thump. I felt the stickiness of my own blood and hair upon my forehead.

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A voice was pleading: ‘Please, leave her alone.’


My mother's voice defeatedly commanded: ‘Why don't you just
fucking cry?’


My energy was gone. I melted to the floor.


I woke up and stared at the ceiling of my bedroom. The silence inside
my head was incredibly loud. People came and went, ashamed. No doctors
came. Donna was back. She stared vacantly at the ceiling. Screaming,
shouting, people were afraid now. Donna did not respond. My older
brother, knocking on my forehead as though it was a door, ‘Anybody
home in there?’ he said. I didn't care at all, nobody was going to answer
the door. His face in my face, up to his old tricks. ‘Leave her alone,’ said a
voice.


At the table, looking at a plate of colours, a knife and fork in my hands. I
looked through the plate of colours, and everything faded out. Hands
disturbed my vision -- a silver knife, a silver fork, cutting up a colour.


There was a piece of something sitting at the end of the silver fork. It sat
there very still. My eyes followed the piece through the fork to a hand.
Frightened, I let my eyes follow the hand to an arm which joined a face.
My gaze fell upon the eyes, which looked back at me with such
desperation. It was my father. I retraced his arm, his hand, the fork, the
piece of colour, then back again. Silently tears streamed down my face. It
was my grandfather all over again. I was back to two years old, and my
grandfather was feeding me. I ate from the fork.


It was decided that I should go and stay in the country for a while. The
three-hour trip was in slow motion. Everything was back in bits. Everything
was a captivating pattern of colours -- green triangles, gold squares,
blue into which I looked up and felt myself swimming.


I entered the house, eyes glued to the floor. It was like when I was three;
carpet seemed to go everywhere, stretching like a series of long snakes.
There was a little girl in a high chair who caught my attention. Good, my
little brother is here, too, I thought.


There was so much silence in my own head, and everything else seemed
so ‘external’. It all seemed a thousand miles away.

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I walked; crunching sounds, happening beneath my feet, as I walked a
long line. I climbed; dirt and grass, my old friends, beneath my hand and
feet. I swung up and down on a swing, head back, higher and higher.
That's it; I'm going to fly.


A girl began to watch me. Her voice, so far away, I followed
automatically. My hand upon short light brown hair. It moved away of its
own accord. Startled, I saw it was a horse.


The little girl in the high chair chattered. Her voice was light and
playful. I tried to understand. I came close up to her, listening to the sound.
We began to talk to one another.


Interrupted. An adult moving about. An oven opening. Cooking? ‘Yes,
it's eel. Have you ever had eel, Donna?’ My name struck me like a slap in
the face. I went into the lounge, sat on top of the couch and listened to
music. The room full of colours, music in my head.


I had some money. I liked the lady in the house; I was going to buy her
something. Stones crunching beneath my feet. My hand clenched around
money. Hand open, hand closed, hand open. Look at the coins! I could
hear my own voice inside my head, giving me a running commentary and,
in doing so, calling me into awareness. ‘What am I doing? What am I
doing? What am I doing?’ All the sentences were becoming patterns of
sound again. Was I talking? Did anyone see my lips move? Did any noise
come out?


I began to fall in love with life. I loved the sky. I loved the ground. I
loved the trees, the grass, the flowers. I loved the glass windows; I waved
hello to myself. I could tug at my hair and feel something. I began to chew
on my arm, tasting the salt on my skin, and looking at my freckles. I was
me. I loved the silver legs of the high chair and the laminated bench-tops;
I'd put my face on them and even lick them. I loved the floor and the roof
and the doors. I loved the little girl who talked to me and her mother who
had fed me eel.


My mother came to pick me up. On the way back to her house, I
watched everything leave. I watched the trees leave and the golden fields. I
watched the road stretch on and on.


In my old attic room I spent all my time losing myself in the pattern of
the wallpaper. As night fell I often sat there just the same, where I was
found silently staring in the darkness. When I needed to go to the toilet I'd

As time went by I became more and more aware of myself through
doing this. I'd watch a puddle form and giggle as it seeped into the
precious carpet. Symbolically this was ‘my world’ with a ‘me’ in it. The
more I covered that carpet, the more of a ‘me’ in the world there was. The
smell didn't worry me. The smell belonged to me and closed out other
things. By the time my mother discovered what I'd done, my purpose for
doing this had already been achieved. I'd called myself back out of my
body into my room -- a room I'd made sure belonged to me.


My mother picked up the rug which covered the latest puddle.
Complete shock registered on her face and matched my own nauseating
fear that my world would be taken away for having been found. Incredibly
she left the room silently.


She returned to drag me off to the doctor. She went in, and I sat in the
waiting room. She returned, drove to the hardware store and bought a
plastic potty. ‘You'll go in this,’ she ordered. My older brother mocked and
teased me. Amazingly she told him to stop. No-one was to talk of it, not
then or ever.


They discussed what to do with the carpet which had for the last few
months been my urinal. ‘Let her put up with it’ was the first solution. It
must have dawned on them that I wasn't too disturbed by that. They tore it
up, and I had bare floorboards to dance and roller-skate on. The carpet and
the behaviour had gone. I never used the potty; I went back to holding on
and keeping control.


I was bored. I wanted to go to school. It seemed that I had not attended
school for six months and things were not going to be that easy. I was to
learn a story and learn to tell it. I was given a false background and told to
tell my new school that I had been going to school in another state. The
other children thought that I was mad. I lasted only two weeks.


My mother had sent me into the office with a note of explanation. It
seemed that I was to be the daughter of a single mother who could not be
contacted as she worked every day to try to support my three-year-old
brother and me.


It seemed that we lived in a flat in the next suburb to the school and I
had the sole responsibility of looking after my little brother. I had recently

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The real story was that I lived in a house three suburbs away, I had two
brothers, the younger of whom was now nine years old, and we lived off
whatever money my mother could get out of my father. I had been
attending the local school three suburbs away, in the same state, but I had
not attended for the last six months. I had done very badly at this last
school.


Every morning I had to catch a bus and tram for the long journey to this
new school. It certainly was a new school as everything in it seemed
new. There were shiny red banisters and curved tinted windows. There
were indoor carpeted staircases everywhere, and the whole place was a
mass of corridors; a puzzle in which you had to choose the right door.


I liked the banisters, which led to hallways with red doors running off
them. I was constantly going into strange classrooms and sitting down
before being escorted out and pointed in the direction of my own class.


I was quiet and eerie. I never understood what I was being asked to do;
and so, sitting obediently in the classroom, I would draw pictures, before
tearing them into tiny pieces and creating piles with them on my desk. The
teachers were fairly patient with me -- or, at least, I cannot remember that
they interrupted me. Perhaps they left me alone, like a new student who
needed time to settle in. Perhaps they were simply glad that I was not
disruptive. Perhaps they thought that I was backward.


On lunch-breaks, I would wander through the school, watching the
various colours which disappeared under my feet, and I would stop
sometimes and stare at something for the entire break, like the polished
floor of the gym or the reflection in the curved tinted-glass windows.
Other children disgustedly began to comment that I was mad. I ignored
them, choosing not even to look at them or even let it register that I'd
heard. I'd heard it all before.


Another girl was said to smell. Nobody wanted to know her. She lived
in the council flats with her drunken father and had the responsibility of
looking after her three younger sisters. I guess she thought I could relate to
her. Her father was hard and violent and used to hit her. I could relate to
that.

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She was tough and a fighter. I had, it seemed, lost all of my fight. She
began to fight people who teased me on my behalf. I never rejected her,
and she hung around, helping me to find my way to classes, hopelessly
trying again and again to teach me to read the timetables. For once, I was
allowing other people to do all the talking. If I replied at all, it was either
with ‘H’m' or in very short sentences.


I began to participate in art class. I had a huge sheet of white paper
upon an easel and I painted a series of coloured fluffy spots. Somebody
asked what it was. ‘Don't know,’ I replied. I decided, after that, that I
would only draw in black and white; black on a white background.


I began to draw stars everywhere and on everything. My mind was
clearly back when I was a baby, through I now had the ability to lash out
violently if anyone tried to get too near to me. One day someone at the
school did. I have no idea what they may have done or said, but they tried
to get too near. I picked up a chair and began to swing it.


I arrived at a new school one more suburb away. This was to be my last
chance. If I had trouble at this new school, I would be sent to a children's
home. I was fourteen years old.


I tried to be as co-operative as possible, which meant that, instead of
lashing out at others so much, I would take it out on myself.


I had been on painkillers for rheumatism, to be taken only when I
needed them. The pains by now had become excruciating, and I would
slam myself side-on into the walls and knock my head against them in any
effort to ease the pain.


Painkillers hardly seemed to help at all, and I felt as though my bones
were grinding together in the same way that I would grind my teeth. I had
also been put on ‘nerve tablets’ by the local doctor, to calm me down. The
doctor on the other corner of the street had given me sleeping tablets as I
was still terrified of sleeping. Instead of taking any of these, I would store
then up and take a handful of them at a time when I had put up with more
than I could take; then I'd eventually find a place to sit, propped against a
fence somewhere on my own, and everything would disappear.


As before, I would swing between silent and vegetative, wild and
destructive, and just plain weird. As I continued to slip back into myself, I
began to be quietly escorted out of class and sent to welfare officers and
shrinks where I would sit and be observed as their words when on and on,

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was being myself. I had been sitting in class losing awareness of everything
around me as I stared into nothingness. It was a reading class, and
I had my pen in my hand and had been staring straight ahead in the direction
of a piece of green chalk on the blackboard ledge.


My folder, the cover of which I had torn to shreds, had now been
painted by me in shiny household paint. My hand was moving
mechanically back and forth as I stared straight ahead.


The teacher's voice had a tone of sympathy, and I panicked
momentarily, thinking that I must have been sick.


As I was lifted from my chair, I grabbed for my folder and found that is
had been carved almost in half and was covered in a mess of blue biro, as
was my hand. My pen was merely a tube of clear plastic with the nib
hanging limply on the end of it and blue ink everywhere.


I was escorted to the assistant headmaster's office and placed in a chair.
‘What's your name?’ said an interrogating voice. ‘Where do you live?’
Mechanically I replied, stating my name and the address I'd been taught to
give. ‘What's your name? Where do you live? What's your name? Where
do you live? What's your name? Where do you live?’ came the echoing
assault upon my ears. I replied, in turn, to each echo, becoming faster and
faster, building up to a crescendo before jumping to my feet, grabbing the
chair that I was sitting on and screaming: ‘I'm not fucking mad!’


‘It's all right, Donna,’ came a voice. ‘Would you like to come with me?’
it said calmly. I was led away to an office and given some paper to draw on.


I was being treated well at this school. They had stopped keeping me in
or giving me lines. It was simple. If I misbehaved beyond the level of
tolerability, I was escorted out to sit in the office again, under observation,
and, if I liked I could draw.

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I liked going to art class. I began to play as though the whole room was
my toy-box.


In a dream state, I jumped from desk-top to desk-top, a chair raised
above my head which I shook from side to side as though it were my
maracas as I sang, first slowly and then fast, the song ‘I Go to Rio.’ I was
putting myself, my words, steps and actions on to speed 3 3 and then speed
78. The rest of the class was in stitches. They would watch me, enthralled. I
really didn't care. It was as though they were in another world, looking at
me having fun in my world under glass.


Stella was one of the children watching. She had had a lot of behaviour
problems and had no hesitation in joining me. We did a duet around the
room. Like a sellout concert, the other students went wild watching, and
we became friends. This girl was intrigued by my ‘madness’. She admired
the way that I didn't seem to care what anyone thought of me and the way
I stood up for myself when people tried to stop me. I also became her
yardstick and an excuse for her own bad behaviour. Truth be known, she
led me into more mischief and danger that I would have been likely to get
into on my own.


I also made my own classes. Often I found myself wandering out of the
school.


Each experience would lead to another. Sometimes Stella would come
with me. I was never going anywhere in particular, just going. I'd climb the
stairs at the high-rise flats, play in the elevator or try to find how to get on
the roof with every intention to jump off and ‘fly’. Other times I'd walk
into factories and explore the materials around and sometimes ask people
what they were making. I played in carwashes, walked along endless
railway tracks, rode on the back of trams and joined classes at other
schools. When I was approached or challenged I'd bolt. I think I learned a
lot about things this way.


My teachers in the mean time were often out looking for me --
sometimes even driving around the streets to catch me and bring me back.
I wasn't misbehaving, however; if they'd found me and told me where to
go, I'd have followed.

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At home I became quiet, brooding and intense. I would walk up to the
faces of family members, lunge forward and weave my hands back
and forth in repetitive figure eights. Slap! came the response again and
again, and I smiled with every hit. I worked especially hard on my mother.
I tried to assert how completely in control I was. She tried to prove that
someone like her could never have a ‘spastic’ for a daughter. Eventually it
was clear she was willing to play for the ultimate stakes. I decided my obsession
wasn't worth the price.


I was living as completely as I could within my own mind, and what I
did express in a very symbolic and disturbing manner. I decided to murder
a part of myself. As anger grew, this internalized version of my mother
threatened to shut me out from my inner self. I decided to kill Willie.


I had been given a small boy doll dressed in jeans and a shirt. I wound a
scrap of red tartan around its body, which was the material my
grandmother had often worn. I coloured his eyes with green crayon so that
they glowed an iridescent bright green.


I found a small cardboard box and painted it black. I waited until
no-one was at home, then went outside to the fish-pond and buried my
symbolic version of Willie in his black coffin, going to great lengths to
cover up any sign of the burial. I went inside and wrote him an epitaph: <i>Let
go, I say, my tear-soaked stranger... I'm afraid that you have drowned beneath the
many dreams which did evade you and the many stars so out of reach. Let go, I say. I
must take over... and perish in a past of shadows, so that I may walk a stronger path</i>.


Looking back, it was not a return to my nothingness that I sought. This
incident was an expression of my desire to overcome the conflicts within
which had made my world of nothingness so necessary. The conflict was
caused, and always had been, by the necessity to give up control and
interact with others. The more I tried, the worse became the conflict. The
more I kept to myself, or kept others at a distance, the clearer things
became.


As always, my motivation to interact was in order to prove my sanity
and avoid getting locked up in an institution. My inability to maintain
this situation for any length of time was due to the state of mind of which
‘my world’ consisted. In this hypnotic state, I could grasp the depth of the
simplest of things; everything was reduced to colours, rhythms and sensations.

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

People often asked me what drugs I was taking. Ever since I was a
toddler my pupils were huge and often made me actually look this way.
When I did take them, it was more to provide me with an excuse for my
behaviour or to intensify my already distant state of awareness. This state
of mind was, I suppose, like some sort of semi-consciousness, as though
my body was awake but I was still asleep. When I gave up being aware of
and responding to things around me, I would return to this state and
would only then feel I was being true to my nature. When I stayed aware
and alert to what was happening around me, it took a lot of energy and
always felt like a battle. I suppose it appeared that way to others, too.


If I was like this because of brain damage, it did not affect my
intelligence, although it seemed that I lacked what is called ‘common
sense’.


Anything I took in had to be deciphered as though it had to pass
through some sort of complicated checkpoint procedure. Sometimes
people would have to repeat a particular sentence several times for me as I
would hear it in bits and the way in which my mind had segmented their
sentence into words left me with a strange and sometimes unintelligible
message. It was a bit like when someone plays around with the volume
switch on the TV.


Similarly my response to what people said to me would often be
delayed as my mind had to take time to sort out what they had said. The
more stress I was under, the worse it became.


The significance of what people said to me, when it sank in as more
than just words, was always taken to apply only to that particular moment
or situation. Thus, when I once received a serious lecture about writing
graffiti on Parliament House during an excursion, I agreed that I'd never
do this again and then ten minutes later, was caught outside writing
different graffiti on the school wall. To me, I was not ignoring what they
said, nor was I trying to be funny: I had not done <i>exactly</i> the same thing as I
had done before.


My behaviour puzzled them; but theirs puzzled me, too. It was not so
much that I had no regard for their rules as that I couldn't keep up with the
many rules for each specific situation. I could put things into categories,
but this type of generalizing was very hard to grasp.


Everything over which I did not have complete control (that which
occurred through the motivation of others) always took me by surprise,
often either shocking or confusing me. It often felt like the effect one gets

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This was the frightening reality of moving within ‘the world’; and, in
comparison, mine held a lot more comfort. ‘My world’ may have been
lonely but it was predictable and came with guarantees.


I don't feel that I was like this because of my home life, although that
was certainly not ‘normal’. I believe that I was like this because of a
constantly changing state of awareness. My home life only affected some
of the forms that my behaviour took, although not the behaviour itself. I
didn't close out the world because of the violence so much as the violence
was closed out because it was one of many parts of ‘the world’.


I had made friends with a girl named Robyn. She was a new kid at school
and didn't have any friends yet. I went home with her to her house,
which was a council flat not far from the school. We sat beneath a tree outside
and called it ‘our tree’. We sang and danced like a pair of overgrown
fairies in the grasslands in the centre of the council estate. She liked being
made part of my world and, more important, she didn't try to invite anyone
else to join in.


Sitting beneath this tree, this first day, it began to get darker. I saw a
man approach us who simply stood at a distance and waved.


‘What's he waving at?’ I asked her.


‘Who?’ she replied.


‘That guy there, the old guy,’ I explained.


She could see no-one and asked what he looked like. I explained,
describing his size and build, his stance, looks and dress.


‘That sounds like my grandfather,’ she said in surprise.


We went upstairs and she told her mother about what I had seen. I
described the man again, and her mother agreed that it certainly did sound
like my friend's grandfather. Three days later her grandfather died.


At school strange things were happening. I would have daydreams in
which I was watching children I knew. I would see them doing the
trivialest of things: peeling potatoes over the sink, getting themselves a

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Amazingly, to the finest detail, I had been right. This was nothing I had
controlled, it simply came into my head, but it frightened me.


My ability to ‘know’ things fascinated my friend's mother, and I became
welcome to stay at their place, which eventually became my
second home.


The first night I stayed for tea, my friend's mother was appalled. ‘What
on earth do you think you're doing?’ she exclaimed as I scooped up my
mashed potatoes with my fingers and put them in my mouth. ‘You'll eat
with a knife and fork, missie,’ she said sternly. I began to scoop up my
food, holding my fork like a shovel. My friend's mother took my plate
away, saying: ‘You'll learn to eat properly or you won't eat at all.’


Although my mother had given me detailed eating, smiling, standing
and manner lessons, they had generally been shortlived; and so I, like my
two brothers, had always been allowed to eat like this. None of us was ever
taken out anywhere (my mother hated going out to public places), so it
didn't seem to matter. Nevertheless, this woman was not going to be
defeated and told me that, if I learned to eat properly, she would take both
me and her daughter out to a restaurant. I learned to copy them like a prize
actress.


One thing which I couldn't learn was how to feel. Robyn's mum would
always hug her before she went off to school, and she insisted on doing
this to me, too.


‘Come and get a hug,’ she said one morning after I'd stayed the night
before.


‘I don't like to,’ I said.


‘You're going to have to learn to,’ my friend's mum insisted. ‘If you're
going to stay here, you will learn to do what my own daughter does.’


So, like a rock, every morning, I learned to tolerate being hugged. I told
my friend's mother that being hugged hurt me. She insisted that this was
nonsense, but that didn't help the feeling go away.

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At first my head would spin. I felt that I was going to faint. I would only
hug her when routine called for it; and in exchange I became her ‘foster’
daughter, with the packed school lunches, the clothes, the collection of
school report-cards and eventually even a bed of my own.


At first I had to share a bed with my friend Robyn. This was impossible
as I could hardly sleep whilst I was trying to maintain the distance between
us. Nevertheless, I felt quite close to my friend and began to tell her about
some of my problems.


<i>They'd save scraps for the stray cats,<br />
And leave out the plate.<br />
It'd always be empty next day.<br />
What she didn't finish, she'd leave for the cats,<br />
For she knew what it felt like to live like a stray</i>.


I always paid for closeness with fear and found that, although not wanting
to go home, I sometimes could not bear my growing emotional dependence
on Robyn and her mother. Instead I would go across to the other
side of their suburb, hang about until the last tram had left and then walk
back in the yard to Stella's garage. Stella was Italian with bleached cropped
cottonwool-like hair and cartoon-like features. She was in some of my
classes and was herself a behaviour problem at school. I became her alibi
and her scapegoat.


Stella's mother said that I was evil and thought that I was a bad
influence on her daughter. Her daughter no doubt encouraged this
impression by blaming my supposed example whenever she got caught
doing anything. Nevertheless, the daughter liked me and was always
happy to be involved in any new drama.


Stella lived in a little terrace house, at the back of which was a
cobblestone alleyway. I arranged with her to climb her back fence and
sleep in the tiny shed in the back of her yard.


In the early hours of the morning, I would climb this tall
corrugated-iron fence, scramble over the roof of the shed and let myself in.
I'd snuggle in next to her brother's greasy motorcycle and, wrapped
securely in the duffel coat which had become my mobile home, I'd fall
asleep. Her parents kept bottles of home-made wine in this shed, and
sometimes, if I was cold, I'd smash the top off one of the bottles and fall

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was beginning to look quite rough. I never washed my coat and rarely
took it off. If I did, I would place it beside me and take it with me if I left
the room. My hair was often greasy, and I never brushed my teeth. I began
to wash myself under the taps in the front yards of people's houses.


My friend Robyn understood. I had explained to her my need to
‘disappear’ and I was always welcome to stay whenever I wanted to. Her
mother made a point of talking to me about the way I dressed and spoke,
and tried to teach me class and sophistication. I liked her and I was a good
student. I stopped swearing and began to behave more like a ‘lady’ -- at
least, whilst I was there. The duffel coat still followed me everywhere and
did for another eight years.


Every so often I would go home. My mother had recently rented a
piano, and I loved the sound of anything that tinkled and had since I was
very small. I would string safety-pins together and, when I wasn't chewing
on them, would tinkle them in my ear. Similarly I loved the sound of metal
striking metal, and my two most favourite objects were a piece of cut
crystal and a tuning fork which I carried with me for years. When all else
failed, music could always make me feel.


I believe that I had always played music, even before I ever had the use
of an instrument. I would create tunes in my head, and my fingers would
play the intervals.


My mother also had a passion for classical music and had decided to
teach herself to play.


As soon as I had noticed it, I was at the piano in a flash. Within a few
minutes I was tapping out tunes I knew, and a little later I began to make up
tunes, playing them quite fluently. It had occurred to me at the time that
this is what I had been doing with my fingers when I had heard music in
my head.


My mother had decided to hang about and watch me in her usual
critical way. She sat down and showed me how she had learned to play
some pieces in a beginner's book she had bought herself. She began to
play, slowly, with two hands. I watched her and looked at the music. She
explained how some of the notes went up and some of the notes went
down and that the distance between them...


I was not interested in sheet music. I began to hang about the house,
and when she was not around I would play the piano, though always
playing up in ‘the tinkles’.

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had created a beautiful piece of music. It was a classical waltz with
melody and accompaniment. My mother walked into the room, catching
me by surprise.


‘I know what this is,’ she said snarlingly.


‘I made it up,’ I replied.


‘No, you didn't,’ she retorted. ‘That's Beethoven.’


It was meant to be an insult, but she never knew how much she had
complimented me. I guess I couldn't blame her for her jealousy. It seemed I
had the Midas touch for all the things she so admired and at which her
sister so excelled: artistic and creative ability.


My mother satisfied her own insecurity by emphasizing that people
who played by ear could not learn to read music. She began to take music
lessons and, in fierce competition with her daughter, who was in no way
trying to compete, she did extremely well.


As if to prove her point, she took me for an introductory music lesson.
The woman teacher told me to forget entirely everything I ‘thought’ I
knew about music. She was there, it seemed, to undo such bad learning
habits and teach me the discipline of music ‘properly’.


Predictably I would not follow the teacher's instructions and would not
co-operate. Satisfied, my mother gloated viciously over my obvious
‘failure’. Five years later I brought my own piano and began to compose.


The piano had been my only renewed interest at home, but the jealousy
my playing had inspired again made life at home intolerable. My mother,
however, began to phone me at my friend's house, commanding I come
home. I'd travel several suburbs back home, she'd send me out to the shop
at the end of the street, then tell me I was free to return to my friend's
house.


Any time I spent at home I spent in my room listening to records. Like
so many other teenagers, I would turn the record up as loud as possible,
sing at the top of my voice and play the same record over and over
again.


I had drawn spirals on all of my records and would sit watching these
wind themselves in. At other times I would place objects on the records,
experimenting with the speed control until the objects would go flying
across the record and sometimes across the room.

Like at school, I would imitate my records, singing them at various
speeds. When I was home, I was driving everybody mad.


My little brother would try to enter my room. I'd almost scream the
house down. My mother would come up and she'd scream the house
down. One day my father came up to try to talk to me.


It was the first time in my life that he had come into my room to talk to
me. My father tried to make conversation with me. He asked me about the
records I was listening to. I played some of the songs that had special
meaning for me. I never explained why; this was one of the only real
efforts I'd made at trying to share how I felt with anyone in my family.


My father had all the right responses; he simply sat within my presence,
letting me show him how I felt in the only way I could -- via objects. He
came back several times, and I eventually had the courage to show him
some of the secret pictures I'd drawn and the poems I'd written.


He wanted, I suppose, so much to bridge the gap between the members
of the family that he had made one fatal mistake. He not only praised the
quality of my work; he did so in front of somebody who was not included
in my efforts to share: my mother.


Cuttingly my mother insisted that I show her what I'd written. I
handed over my poems, and she mockingly read some of what I had
written out loud, criticizing the grammar, the images I had used, and ‘its
madness’. ‘It's typical,’ she said, as though that summed up everything.
Fortunately, in the evasiveness of my so-called ‘mad’ writing, its meaning
eluded her; and so, to my mind, it remained ‘uncontaminated’ by
‘informed’ criticism. My father looked at me apologetically. I guess he was
something of an eternal optimist.


My father had never laid a hand on me. Despite this, my mother sought
to convince me that my father was ‘looking at me’. I was always so easily
fooled, often believing the most unbelievable things, only to be made a
fool of later. I began to ignore my father as my mother so actively
encouraged. Sadly it was the last effort at reaching me that my father was
to make for three years.


At school the other children had begun to pick on me. I'd become fairly
insensitive to being called mad but I was now being called stupid and,
quite aware of my own naïveté, this still hurts. As always, I reacted violently,
though this time my opponents were boys.

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mother, in sympathy for the way I was being attacked, gave me one
last chance at another school. This time it was to be on her terms. I was
now fourteen years old, and I was going to go to a girls' school.


My friend Robyn's mother had taken on a huge project when she took
me in; but away from her house not a lot had changed.


I may have been secretive and private but I was not sly or cunning. Her
rules, like all rules, only applied to the particular situation I learned them
in.


I certainly believed in the value of the things she had tried to teach me,
but everything I learned I learned from her. I simply never realized that
such lessons had relevance for <i>me</i>. Thus, no sooner was I out of the door
than my manners, stance and means of communicating went back to
square one.


There were, however, a few exceptions. Most important, she was the
only adult I would listen to about anything to do with my own body. She
also taught me how to tolerate affection, proximity and concern. I learned
to trust her daughter enough to let her brush my hair and tickle my feet
and forearms, and this allowed me to experience the pleasure and
relaxation I could get from touch albeit in a very primitive form.


The experiences I had gained from this family unit also helped me
several years later when I learned to reflect on what I had learned, as a
means of mechanically constructing a more stable, presentable and
sociable identity under the committed guidance of an equally invaluable
human being: my psychiatrist.


Sexuality had always disturbed me, probably because of how
claustrophobic I felt when other people came near me. My mother, who
was extremely paranoid about me becoming a teenage mother, took every
available opportunity to put down and physically abuse me for any signs
of femininity.


In some ways her fears were justified. I was extremely naïve and
believed anything I was told. I often went off with strangers, being enticed
down lanes and towards strange cars by lures of saving poor starving
kittens or getting lollies. Fortunately it had always been another, very
characteristic part of my nature which saved me from any real harm: my
complete dislike of physical proximity and being touched. I may never

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had occasionally actually wanted to be spoken to by boys I met. These
boys, however, were always the quiet ones who never approached me, and
so I never spoke to them. At the same time, other boys were, I suppose,
attracted to my naïveté. I was easily led and easily conned and was easy
pickings for egocentric bullying types who got a kick out of how evasive I
became. I was already well skilled in the art of kicking such beasts where it
hurt, but my increasing need to appear to be coping and ‘normal’ meant
that I put my friend's mother's lessons about tolerating affection to very
bad use.


As I was completely unable to say, let alone acknowledge, what I did or
didn't want, boys found that they could mentally corner me. I had
nevertheless grown up in a house full of strangers and parties, and was
skilled in evasiveness if not in emotional self-defence.


One could, I suppose, blame my mother for putting the fear of imprisonment
into my head. Then, again, it was my mind, not hers, which
conjured up the monstrous connotations of the words. To me, a children's
home was a prison, and I was absolutely terrified of outside control.


I did not fear that my arms and legs would be ripped off in a children's
home. They would have been welcome to take them with my blessing. I
was terrified that they would make me do things there; that they would not
leave me be; that they would deny me my freedom to escape into my own
lonely, though secure, prison.


When I locked myself in, I locked other people out. In my own family I
felt I still had reasonable control over this. At the same time, it was the very
threat of having my circumstances changed (no matter how bad they may
have seemed) that made me try so hard to convince people that I was
capable of their precious ‘normality’. It was this that, so strongly against
my own will, caused me to fight so hard for so little reward at the joyless
achievements of remaining aware and responsive.


It was this fear of having ‘my own world’ taken away from me that
resulted in behaviour which forced me to deny ‘my own world’ in place of
a more presentable, well-mannered, sociable, though emotionless, shell.
‘They’ never got to lay a hand on the real me, but more and more, to their
elation, I began to stop visiting myself.

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I began to stop looking at the spots and losing myself in the colours. I
began to lose grip on my love of the things around me and, in doing so,
was left with ‘their’ shallow securities and ‘their’ complete lack of
guarantees. My hatred became my only realness and, when I was not
angry, I said sorry for breathing, for taking up space, and even began to say
sorry for saying sorry. This total denial of a right to live was a consequence
of learning to act normal. Everything outside of me told me that my
survival was to rest on my refining the act of acting normal. On the inside I
knew that by definition this meant that whatever and whoever I was
naturally was unworthy of acceptance, belonging or even life.


My history at this last school was the same as at the others. I was a failure.
I still failed to participate, or did so inappropriately. I still
walked out of classes, threw things or got violent. I still failed to hand in
any work at all, though with one exception.


I had liked one of my teachers, which was quite unusual for me as I
normally either disliked them or was indifferent to them. Liking anyone,
however, posed major difficulties for me as it made me far more nervous
and left me more unprepared than in dealing with someone I disliked. I
don't know why I liked this teacher, perhaps it was because she seemed to
have little ‘self’ about her.


She was always talking about what had happened throughout history
to various disadvantaged groups. Nothing she ever said had any feeling or
stubbornness, bias or opinion. She simply discussed facts.


I found it impossible to talk to her in a normal voice. I began to put on a
strong American accent, making up a history and identity for myself to go
with it. As always, I actually convinced myself that I was this new character
and consistently kept this up for six months.


Whilst the other teachers found me a devil, this teacher found me to be
bright, amusing and a pleasure to teach. At the end of term, I handed her
the most important piece of school work any of my high school teachers
had received.


The students had all been given a set date and topic on which to write. I
had been intrigued by the way black people had been treated in America in
the sixties.


I told my teacher that what I wanted to do was a secret, and she agreed
to extend my due date as I enthusiastically informed her of the growing

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In all my high school years, this was my greatest achievement. I had, of
course, done this project, not so much out of my own interests as much as
in an effort to win this teacher's approval. Unfortunately, this tendency is
one I have been largely unable to overcome.


My mother decided that it was time for me to get a job. I was fifteen
years old.


I had been the house-cleaner and done cleaning jobs for my father. I
was also very keen on sewing. It was a toss-up between being a cleaner or a
machinist. I began my first full-time job as a machinist and lasted exactly
three days.


Though I am now opposed to the killing of animals for fur coats, I still
loved the feel of fur at that time, and made no connection between a live
animal and a fur coat.


I had always had difficultly with the conception of something being
turned into something else. I understood cows, but when they became a
herd they stopped being cows for me. I understood that ‘herd’ was a word
used for a group but did not understand the word ‘cattle’. Fur was like that,
too. Once it was being sewn, it was material and had never been and could
never be animals.


What I did know is that I loved the feel of fur on my face. I was a
runny-nosed, freckle-faced, fifteen-year-old kid rubbing her face into fur
coats with no conception of nor respect for their value or the notion that
they were supposed to stand for ‘class’.


The boss was Italian and, like so many Italians, was a hard worker and
expected the same of his employees. I was to begin on the easiest of
machines: the button-holer.


The button-holer machine cuts a hole in the garment and then stitches
around the hole it has made. It was magic. I was fascinated by the feel of fur
under my hands. I was in paradise.

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I worked hard and I worked fast. Soon the box of fur coats began to fill
up, and the boss passed by, impressed with the speed of my work. He
decided to check the quality.


A horrified look grew upon his face, and he began to shout as he turned
each garment around and around.


‘What have you done?’ he screamed over and over. ‘Button-holes in the
sleeves, button-holes in the collar, button-holes in the back panel. Get the
hell out of here.’


‘Can I have my money?’ I asked shyly.


‘No!’ he screamed. ‘Do you know what you've done? You've caused me
thousands of dollars in damage. Get the hell out of here before I kick you
out.’


I hadn't realized that the button-holes were meant to go anywhere in
particular.


I was able to apply myself so much better to a full-time job than I ever
was to school work. At school I had never had one consistent identity,
and my behaviour was all over the place. In my new job I was given an image,
and the whole point seemed to be to be true to this role at all times.


My form of concentration was never to be alert, as this would cause me
to drift off. Instead I would lose myself in the monotonous tasks I was
given to do. I moved so freely and systematically through my work that
many people hardly noticed my very distant state of mind.


I had been very lucky, I was told, at having landed a job as a shop
assistant in a department store. I loved my job but hated dealing with
people.


It seemed that I was in paradise, surrounded by racks and shelves of
coloured garments, shiny shoes, rows of numerically ordered packages,
and everything was arranged in aisles. It seemed almost unbelievable that I
would be expected to do the thing I loved most: put things in order. There
were numbers to be counted and ordered; there were colours and sizes and
types of article to be grouped; every department was kept separate from
every other department and called by a different name; it was a world of
guarantees, and this department store even offered those, too.


I was the best little worker they had, I was told. Heads of various
departments would ask to ‘borrow’ me to tidy up the mess in their
departments, which I would do in record time, in every detail. I was the

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Customers would approach me for help, and I would completely ignore
them. As this was my most important role as a shop assistant, my bosses
could never overlook this. When I did help them, I often did it with such
bitter resentment that customers would complain to management about
the rude girl in such and such department.


Sometimes the customers would tap me on the shoulder. I'd tell them to
wait a minute, as I continued compulsively to sort out racks and shelves. If
they persisted, I would abruptly remind them that I had told them to wait.
People sometimes couldn't believe my arrogance.


However, I was not being intentionally arrogant. These people had,
uninvited, tried to take away my choice at being touched, though to them
it was a mere tap on the shoulder. These were the people who, out of their
own selfishness, would rob me of my sense of peace and security, which,
unlike them, I could not find in their version of ‘everyday life’.


As people began to explain how other people experienced my
behaviour, I came to learn that all behaviour had two definitions: theirs
and mine. These ‘helpful’ people were trying to help me to ‘overcome my
ignorance’ yet they never tried to understand the way I see the world. It
seemed so simple to them. There were rules. The rules were right. I
obviously needed their help to learn them.


There was also another problem: the way I spoke.


I would often fluctuate between accents and pitch and the manner in
which I described things. Sometimes my accent seemed quite ‘polished’
and refined. Sometimes I spoke at though I was born and bred in the
gutter. Sometimes my pitch was normal, at other times it was deep like I
was doing an Elvis impression. When I was excited, however, it sounded
like Mickey Mouse after being run over by a steamroller -- high-pitched
and flat.


Someone didn't know the price of a soft toy. I was told to get on the
microphone and ask for its price and code. I was nervous and excited. I was
going to say something on the microphone which would be heard over the
entire store.

[p. <i>77</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I looked at what I was to describe. I saw a yellow stuffed duck. Whether
polished and refined or subtle as a sledgehammer, I had always been
notorious for bluntly telling it like I saw it. I got on the microphone and in
a very loud, flat, high-pitched drawl demanded: ‘Give me a price and code
on a yellow stuffed duck.’


Laughter poured forth from the walls. The entire shop seemed to be
laughing. I walked back to where I had been working, wondering what
had happened since I'd been gone that had made everyone laugh.


My boss glared at me, mortified. ‘What did you say?’ she announced in
disbelief.


‘When?’ I asked.


‘On the microphone, you stupid girl,’ she added.


I was called up to the office.


‘Donna, we've got a new job for you. We're sure you'll like it,’ said the
assistant manager, sitting behind his desk, hands clasped, looking like a
ridiculous praying mantis.


‘But I don't want another job,’ I said innocently.


‘We've decided that you should go and work in the storeroom. You'll
like it in there,’ he added, sounding like he was convincing himself, for I
certainly didn't feel convinced.


The storeroom was dark, a long corridor with other long corriors running
off it. Like the rest of the store, everything was divided up into
separate sections. There was neatness and order, but a lot of the prettiness
was missing. Nevertheless I was content with the isolation. With this now
being the domain of my boss and myself alone, I began to treat it as such.


People often came into the storeroom to see if something was in stock. I
began to close the door on people, trying to keep them out. Then I'd walk
away back to what I was doing.


I was extremely possessive of any of my tidying and would go off like a
firecracker if anyone left anything out of order.


I had also decided that I would take orders from one person and one
person only. One day my boss's boss came in, the store manager. He began
to talk to me. I had become upset about something and was huddled in a
ball down one of the long corridors.


My own boss had been unable to approach me, as I picked up the
merchandise and hurled articles at her like missiles. She had arrived with

[p. <i>78</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Like Robyn's mother, my boss had seen me as a wayward child in need
of guidance. She didn't realize that I was already functioning in line with a
very stringent set of rules but that mine were not compatible with life as a
secure, well-adjusted social being.


Outside work, I had, like so many times before, cut myself off from the
people I knew, some of whom had grown quite fond of me.


I had begun to skate, which was something that gave me a great sense
of freedom and beauty. I felt untouchable as I sped around the
skating-rink, people becoming a momentary blur of colour as I whizzed
past them. Like everything else, I had taught myself well; and, dancing
alone, oblivious to everyone else around me, I began to attract attention.


A young man approached me and began to skate around with me. As
always, boys would comment on how well I skated or challenge me to
defend myself by saying that I thought I was good. Some would skate
around me, trying to be impressive. I was not easily impressed, and I was
not particularly impressed by this young man. After the usual blah blah
blah, he offered to walk me home. I accepted.


I walked ahead of Garry most of the way, and he didn't seem to
acknowledge my evasiveness. I stood at the front gate, not particularly
wanting to go inside. He kept saying words. I replied -- Yes, sir. No, sir.
Three bags full, sir. He kissed me -- or perhaps I should say he kissed my
face, as I wasn't in it at the time.


I met Garry almost every night when I went to the rink. He said he
loved me. Echoing, I said I loved him, too. He wanted me to come and live
with him one day. Me, too, I said. He kissed my face again.


Well, I'd said the words; it must have been love. He wanted me to live
with him. Great! I didn't want to live at home any more. I would go and
live at his place.

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I called a taxi and filled it up with my bags and tins full of treasures, my
stereo and records and the few clothes that I had brought myself since I
had been working. I arrived at Garry's flat and, to his flatmate's complete
surprise, moved in.


Garry arrived home to the sheepish grin of his flatmate's girlfriend who
informed him that I'd moved in.


‘What!’ he exclaimed in disbelief.


‘You said you wanted me to live with you,’ I explained.


‘One day, I said,’ he stressed.


Nevertheless, I was there, and that was that.


My mother freaked out entirely. She had a strange feeling about my
absence and checked my room to find I'd taken everything personal,
leaving the place with the eeriness of a mortuary which hung on every
unwanted and rejected item I'd left behind in the room. The bare floor,
wall-to-wall mirrors, the barred windows and a hoard of untouched,
unwanted dolls left behind spoke of who I was. My mother stood there
among the rejected and, so she told me, cried for the first time.


I had no intention of returning. It was not that I'd found the love of my
life, nor did I think so. I was not particularly excited about the adventure of
leaving home. I had simply been invited (or so it appeared to me) to take
the next step along the road to independence which I thought was
synonymous with being left alone. I had a lot to learn.


I did not particularly want to share this man's bed, or have sex with
him. I was disturbed and anxious about the changes that had taken place
during the day and didn't want to be on my own, though I'd have been
happier if my company had been deaf, dumb, blind and indifferent to me.
He wasn't.


At first Garry was furious with me. He told me that he didn't
particularly want to live with me and that it was too late now and he'd have
to learn to live with it. For my part, I found it useful to play my old role of
Carol, always willing to please, anything to avoid being sent away. Garry
was an immature and insecure adult. He thought this role suited me and
learned to make use of it as one would a household utensil.


I was not particularly thrilled about sex. I had decided my body didn't
belong to me at all. I felt it was something quite separate from me, numb;
my eyes staring into nothingness and my mind a thousand miles away. I
felt somehow killed and yet somehow free by being so cut off and
unreachable. In some perverse way I'm sure Garry liked having a victim
instead of a partner. I understood that sex was a condition of my staying
there. Garry created many new conditions, too. He was to receive all of the

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There were four of us altogether, and we moved into a house with one
other: a man, recently separated, named Ron.


The violence still went on night after night. I'd hide in a corner,
huddled, holding my head. It was cat-and-mouse, and there was nowhere
to hide. Sometimes the others would tell Garry to close the door while he
hit me because he was making too much noise.


One night I sat up in the lounge, again too afraid to go to sleep; now
frightened by both the bashings and the darkness. The darkness in my
soul, however, was the greatest, and I sat there staring vacantly into space
tearing my arm up with a nail I had found.


Ron came in. He sat next to me and, in my dazed state, I thought he was
trying to understand. He said I could come out with him driving in his van.
I went.


Ron pulled over to the side of the road and told me that if I wanted to
go home I would have to have sex with him. I opened the van door, got out
and began walking up the road, out in the middle of nowhere, with no idea
of where I was going.


‘Get back in the van,’ he said through the open window as he drove
slowly along beside me.


I continued to walk.


‘You don't know where you are,’ he said.


‘Don't care,’ I said bluntly.


‘Come on, get in the van. You won't have to do anything,’ he said.


I continued to walk.


‘You're mad, you know that,’ he said. ‘You're stark raving mad.’


Eventually, I got back into the van and he drove me home without
incident.


The next day I walked around the block, hypnotized by the monotony
of going round and round and round again. I heard only the rhythm of my
own footsteps and saw only the blur of the houses which, like the people at
the skating-rink, had whizzed past me. As I did this, I tore apart the inside
of my arm -- the part of my body my friend Robyn had taught me to feel.


There was a couple staying in the house, Garry's cousin and his
pregnant fifteen-year-old girlfriend. The inside of my arm was a mass of
blood and pus and torn flesh. The eight-months-pregnant girlfriend

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Garry's sister had a flat a few suburbs away. She lived there with her
three-year-old daughter in a neighbourhood teeming with cats. The
couple were to sleep in the daughter's bedroom. The daughter was to sleep
with the mother. I was to sleep on the lounge floor after the visitors had
gone.


I had no mattress, pillows or blankets. I was allowed to use the cushions
off the couch after everyone had gone to sleep. I kept my treasures in the
linen-cupboard next to where I lay, covered myself with a towel and went
to sleep.


Garry's sister was very like him. I gave her most of my wages and almost
all of the rest to the couple, in exchange for their offer to take
me with them when they moved up-country in a few weeks’ time after they
baby was born. On top of this, I looked after Garry's sister's daughter
when I got home from work and at weekends.


There was never any food in the house, although half of the money I'd
given this woman was intended for food. I went to work in my job in the
storeroom and watched people eat. When people asked me why I didn't
eat, I told them I wasn't hungry. People offered me some of their food. I
scoffed it down like a wild dog. Some of the women at work got into the
habit of buying themselves too much for lunch and giving me what they'd
brought. Their kindness brought tears to my eyes, and I ate gratefully with
tears silently rolling down my cheeks.


At home in the flat my only salvation was that little girl, and she became
the entire world for me. I would take her with me everywhere, and almost
everything she did I did, too.


It was as though I had a playmate my own age. At times I was in a dream
state, possibly not even as complex as the world seen by a three-year-old.
At other times, beginning to come out of myself, being there with this
little girl felt about all that I could handle without my defences distorting
my self-expression and leaving me a thousand miles away from who I
really was, emotionally and often mentally, too.

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had spent my last birthday away from home. My family had given me
a set of coloured pencils. I sat looking at them intently, alone in the flat I
was sharing, and felt deeply hurt that I no longer could allow myself to
draw in colour, for the self-expression of using colour demonstrated
choice and inspired too much fear. I cried as I clung to a tiny doll on a
string which my little brother had given me.


I had begun to get quite sick, and under my nervous painted smile it
was quite clear that I was extremely depressed.


Up until now I had refused to have much to do with my family. My
father had been deeply hurt by me leaving and began to snub me when I
phoned up nervously waiting to be asked if I wanted to come back home.
My two brothers had rejected me as someone who had, it seemed, proved
to them that they were as worthless as discarded rubbish. My mother, who
had told anyone who asked that I'd left because I was a slut, was, for a
change, more understanding. Charitably she invited me to come back. I
agreed. I had been gone three months. It was Christmas-time.


I was now sixteen years old. The family which had often felt so very foreign
to me now felt even more so. I hung about on the fringes like an
outsider. My presence at Christmas had been unexpected, but I still received
presents from people. The presents from my parents' friends and
relatives hurt most. Although they had often given me Christmas presents,
I felt they were making a special effort towards me and I couldn't face
them or even bring myself to say thank you. I simply felt too fragile.


My older brother had been teasing me, and I had been teasing him
back. Things got out of hand, and I was on the receiving end. My
mother decided that it was time for me to move out.


I had been home for only three months. My mother knew I'd lost all of
my money and came into the shop I was working in, throwing a bank
book at me. In it she had deposited the cost of the security bond on a flat. I
got home and she threw the newspaper in front of me, telling me to find
myself a flat. I found one two suburbs away and, because I was still only

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had left my job as a storeroom assistant and taken a job in a factory
near my flat. I had come full circle and was now working the dreaded
button-hole machine again.


I lived on my own and felt proud of the way I was taking control over
my own life, but I was terribly lonely.


Every night I would walk barefoot down to the local shop and
telephone my old friend Robyn, with whom I had still intermittently
stayed in touch. I would phone up with nothing to say and ask her ‘So how
are you?’ about ten times, before saying goodnight and hanging up. Her
mother had always enjoyed showing me off as her charity project, and the
novelty had begun to wear off.


I had been walking home after one of these phone calls when a group
of boys my own age who hung about outside the shop began to harass me.
I guess I looked like an easy target for harassment as I was always out
making phone calls at the same time each night, barefoot, in the same long
oversized baggy jumper, come rain or shine. I'd never talk to them or look
at them. I'd just walk straight back home. For kicks, they decided to follow
me.


The three of them walked directly behind me. I was frightened. I
opened the door of my flat, and one of them put his hand on the door,
holding it open.


‘Aren't you going to invite us in?’ he asked.


‘Get out,’ I said, frightened.


‘That's not very nice,’ he said. ‘I think we'll come in and take a look
around.’


With that the three of them entered my flat as though they owned it.


‘What have you got here,’ I pleaded, as they went through the contents
of my cupboards, laughing at my poverty and mocking my vulnerability.


I became so scared that I went and stood outside my own front door.
The three gave up, cheekily strutting out the front door one by one,
laughing. The last one announced that he needed to ‘take a piss’, which he
promptly did, in full view, on my front door.


I stood there horrified as the three of them proudly strutted off. That
night I put on my best dress, took a handful of sleeping pills, played my
favourite record and danced around the flat. Dazed, I caught a glimpse of
my reflection in the mirror and began, like all those years ago, to talk to
Carol. I began to cry, and all I knew what that I didn't want to be there any

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The look on my own face was too much. It wasn't Carol looking back
any more. I panicked.


Willie stood in front of the mirror thinking that, if I died, people would
see me dressed like that, like a pretty little girl. I took off my dress and put
on my old jumper. As Willie, I ripped a sheet and wound the scraps around
my wrists and fell asleep.


It was clear that I needed help. Carol had no intention of telling anyone
what had happened but could no longer face the mess in the flat. I put on
my jeans and walked, at six o'clock in the morning, up to my friend
Robyn's place.


Robyn's mum answered the door.


‘Hello, pet,’ she said. ‘What's the matter?’


‘Nothing,’ said Carol, laughing lightheartedly. ‘Just thought I'd come
down for a visit.’


Carol sat at the kitchen table whilst she made me the customary cup of
tea. I had begun to bleed through my jumper, and Robyn's mum looked at
me in shock, saying: ‘What have you done?’ She realized what I'd done
and, knowing that I might run if she panicked, she calmly asked if she
might take a look at my arms. Carol complied, explaining that she'd had a
little accident. Robyn's mother explained that these ‘scratches’ might get
infected and asked me to let them take me to the hospital. Carol agreed to
let Robyn take me there. Everybody was calm, cool and collected. The
nurse came and spoke to me. The doctors took blood tests. I was given
food to eat and lots to drink, and when I told them I was ready to go they
told me I was not. I was made to see a psychiatrist.


Mary didn't frighten me. She seemed to be a firm but gentle person
who didn't react to whatever image I tried to throw at her. She asked me
why I'd done what I'd done. I told her it was because ‘there was no love left
in the world’.


She sat across from Willie and told me that she didn't think that I was as
tough as I thought I was and that she thought there was a scared little girl
inside me who was trying to get out. I wondered if she knew how rights
she was. Willie spent a year thinking about what she had said.

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I returned to the flat and the factory and the ritual telephone calls from
outside the local shop. A tall lanky man sat on a crate outside the shop.
This was the local haunt, and this was his usual spot. A friend and he were
paying a lot of attention to me as I made my usual telephone calls.


‘Hi, how are you, so how are you, yeah yeah yeah...’ I said on the
phone.


‘Hi,’ called the young man as I later walked past, ignoring him. ‘Aren't
you going to be friendly and talk to me?’ he persisted.


His friend interrupted, suggesting that I ask his friend, Chris, back to
my place for a coffee.


‘I haven't got coffee,’ I replied.


‘That's OK,’ said his friend. ‘He'll take tea.’


It seemed to be settled as far as these two were concerned. Chris was to
come to my place for a cup of tea.


I walked into my own flat ahead of him, almost oblivious to his
presence. He took a seat on my fifteen-dollar couch from the Salvation
Army and made himself quite at home.


‘I haven't got any tea,’ I explained.


‘That's OK,’ said Chris. ‘I'll just stay for the conversation.’ He hung
around making one.


Chris was Italian and lived around the corner from my flat. He had
noticed the bandages on my wrists, and I told him that I had sprained them
doing a handstand. He didn't believe me. I told him about the incident
with the three guys which had led up to my ‘accident’. As it turned out, the
one who had urinated on my front door was his younger brother.


<i>I move from place to place, a life of nameless faces,<br />

I look in the minor, in the face looking back I see...<br />
‘Don't know. Who is me?’</i>


Chris had a key to my flat and made good use of it, throwing parties
and referring to it as his flat. I sat about, a stranger in my own flat,

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My flat got flooded from a blockage in the flats' sewerage. I stood there
screaming. The landlord stood there saying ‘Not a problem. We'll clean it
up with a mop.’ The estate agent agreed that he wouldn't allow a dog to
sleep in those conditions. I was given another, though more expensive,
flat.


Chris's friend, Peter, moved into the spare room. He taught me to cook
and to iron clothes and, being quite a giant, he would throw me up into the
air and catch me. I'd fall to the ground laughing, and he'd tickle me as I
wildly came to life.


Life moved fast, and I moved even faster. It wasn't long before I had left
this flat far behind and Peter with it. I was saying words, taking actions,
but I wasn't there.


I moved house every two months, and when I wasn't moving house I
moved jobs. Chris would see the cardboard boxes laid out on the bed and
realize that I was moving house again.


I spent my spare time inspecting new flats, though never moving
outside the one suburb. I lost a fortune in security bonds, but I felt
compelled to move as two months in one place had begun to feel like two
very long years.


Living as Carol, completely cut off from my real self and the emotions it
embodied, I became terrified of being left alone. I feared becoming
possessed by the real me which seemed to lurk in the shadows like a ghost
waiting for Carol to be left alone; waiting for life to slow down and catch
up with her.


I played the role of Carol so convincingly that I hardly acknowledged
that this fear was my fear of losing a grip on this character. I had played
Carol so persistently that she had become a self. My little brother came
around to see me. But Carol had no brother Tom.


<i>Tell me, do you remember me? Do I look like I belong?<br />

To find a face in the crowd that I might know.<br />
Do you have the time for one more friend?<br />
Do I have a face you'd like to know?<br />
Well, we might just start there,<br />
It's a good a place as anywhere</i>.

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tom had come to the door of the flat. The door was opened, and Carol
stood there staring at the figure of a ten-year-old boy on the doorstep.
Having not seen me for almost a year, Tom probably remembered the real
me, Donna, who had shared her world with him when he was three. The
girl who answered the door was the one who had, like everything else in
her life, walked away because there was too much closeness to handle.


‘Hi, sis,’ Tom announced as he stood on the doorstep, dwarfed by his
older sister.


‘Mum brought me down. She's out the front. Do you want to see her?’
he said.


‘Nuh,’ said the girl flippantly. ‘Want to come in?’


‘I can't,’ said Tom. ‘Mum's asked me to come and ask you to see her,’ he
added.


‘Oh, well, tell her I can't,’ said the girl casually. ‘I guess you'd better go.’


Tom went. It was his last visit for two years.


Chris had moved in. He liked the latest flat. Carol brought out the
cardboard boxes, but Chris refused to move with her. Carol was now on a
trapeze which had begun to swing without mercy. Donna's older brother,
James, entered the scene before Carol's last curtain-call.


James had never liked Donna. She'd always been hard to understand
and never seemed to say anything he could make sense of. He was,
however, going through his own teenage years; an adult way before his
time; alone and lonely. For better or for worse, he decided there was now
some advantage in reaching out to his sister. He was greeted by Carol.


James sat on the couch, talking to the charming and captivating
character who sat there masquerading as his sister. I had switched to
‘automatic pilot’ and watched myself from outside my own body as I
responded openly and effortlessly to the brother I had never had any
desire to get to know.


James had found a friend who was almost made to order. His sister had
fortunately changed. This girl had no longing look for understanding, and
spoke casually and amusingly without any of the distrust or cautiousness
he had known in his sister. He liked her, and decided to come around more
often.


It was as though I had been watching a play, although I was
simultaneously in the audience as well as being on stage. But, as my older
brother continued to visit, Carol began to falter, finding it increasingly
difficult to communicate. Donna had reverted to ‘talking in poetry’
evasively.

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Playfully my brother began to call me ‘a blonk’ and told me to stop
‘wonking’. I froze as though he were a nightmare come to life. He was
again calling me mad, stupid and incomprehensible. I looked at him,
wondering at how he had come to feel so comfortable in my flat. He
eventually began to realize that this was no mere mood that I was in. I had
gone back to being the same way I used to be, and he had better things to
do with his time than waste any more of it on his ‘crazy’ sister who seemed
to resent or ignore his company. James dropped in again two years later,
when we were once again enemies as always.


Donna was the ghost, and the ghost was back. People, however, had
come to expect Carol, and Carol put up a fight.


I had become agoraphobic. I tried to walk to the local shops. I would
shake, feeling my knees give out from under me. I was again a frightened
caged animal, running from and flinching at any efforts to come near me,
though clutching at Chris as the only adult who could protect me from the
invasion of the outside world.


I became unable to work, running out on jobs without explanation. I
began to tremble and feel like I was going to faint. In panic I would look
around my once familiar surroundings, unable to make sense of them or
why I had forced myself to be there. Carol would front up to each job
interview, and Donna would run out on the job after every few weeks.


I had developed two nervous tics and broke out in a purple rash which
covered my chest, neck and half of my face every time I was approached on
or spoke about any and every emotionally laden topic.


Chris was unable to cope and began to go out every night. One day he
announced that he was going away for the weekend.


I was in a state of panic. Chris's going away was like the feeling of
desertion I had felt when my grandfather had died when I was five. At the
same time I had to paint a smile upon my tear-soaked face and wave
bye-bye with my best impression of the Carol he had grown fond of. I was
not convincing. Carol had progressed to being a teenager, but Donna was
still only two years old at a stretch.


I sat alone in the flat, deserted and terrified. I needed a mother
desperately, but could not remember ever having one; and, truth be
known, this, too, would have to be a construction within my own world, if

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As Carol, Chris had become entangled in my life. Giggling, sociable
and made to order, Carol had become all he expected and demanded, yet
he had walked out on Donna as though she were a complete stranger. I
remembered the words of another complete stranger which had been
echoing in my mind since having met her a year before. I went to the
casualty department of the hospital in which she worked and asked to see
Mary, the psychiatrist who had been able to see the frightened little girl
inside who had been trying to get out.


I was called into the cubicle of the casualty department and seen by an insensitive
orderly who tried to insist that I could not see Mary and that I
was just a little bit upset and would soon be fine.


Words were to be my only chance, and Willie's complete lack of tact
came viciously to the rescue.


Willie's eyes raced around the cubicle, scanning the possibilities of
objects which could be thrown and verbally assaulting the unsuspecting
orderly with attacks of ‘What do I have to do? Tear this room to bits, cut
myself up and bleed everywhere?’ The orderly arranged for Mary to see
me.


Mary and Willie sat in the office across the table from one another. I was
fighting to break the surface of the character who sat there desperately
trying to defend me and, at the same time, defeating the purpose of getting
help.


Willie explained the nature of the problem at hand in a relatively calm
and controlled way. It was explained to Mary that the problem was an
inability to trust Chris whilst he was away and that this was causing
pressure on the relationship. Mary, testing the water, questioned my own
ability to be trusted and then asked me what my family had been like.


The rash began to creep, and I could sense emotion creeping to the
surface with it. ‘What does that have to do with anything?’ Willie asked
rather defensively at a last-ditch effort to clutch at straws which might
temporarily prop up my encroaching fragility, and wasting time in order to
think up a new strategy. Mary explained that it had a lot to do with things
and asked me once again about my family. Willie began to describe my

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mary left the room. I panicked. By the time she came back I was a
crying, babbling mess. She suggested we meet again the next day.


It was Sunday. I had only one more day to get through before the whole
world would once again come through my front door in the form of Chris.


I bought some strawberries on the way to the hospital, from the shop at
the end of the street, and entered the hospital waiting room, waiting to be
called. Donna was called into the office; and Carol, carrying the bag of
strawberries, entered.


Carol was always sent out to test the water before Donna decided it was
safe to jump in. Mary and I ate the strawberries. Tokenistic as the gesture to
offer them may have been, Mary had accepted them and got past the first
hurdle. My fears began to emerge.


‘I'm not mad, you know, am I?’ said Carol, hoping that Mary would not
confirm the fear that I actually was. Mary was always reassuring, telling me
that I need not worry so much about it.


‘They're not going to lock me up, are they?’ asked Carol, echoing the
old fear of being sent to a children's home.


‘No, you're not going to get locked up,’ echoed Mary.


My fears broke the surface, and I began to sob like a child.


It was arranged that I would see Mary twice a week for the first couple
of weeks. These weeks were to stretch on into months and then into years.
Mary was to become the most important mental influence on my life since
I met that stranger named Carol in the park fourteen years before.

Mary had asked me what I expected to get out of the sessions. I had
told her: ‘I just wanna be normal.’ I had never questioned the concept
of normal but I felt that I didn't fit the category by a long shot.


We almost always sat in the same office; the same view, overlooking the
city street with a view of the park across the road. When it was night-time,
I would look out at the city lights, and sometimes, in my mind, I would feel
as I might have done in one of my flying dreams, this time moving through
the blackness to the colours.


This office symbolized my dilemma. I was stuck in a small room of
brightness, and the rest of the world was a beckoning but unreachable
brightness which lay miles beyond a terrifying journey through the dark.
Mary was to help guide me there. At home, in a diary, I would draw
pictures of this over and over again: a white square within a larger black
square, surrounded everywhere by the blinding whiteness of the paper.


Recently I saw this picture again. It had been drawn by a young autistic
girl and was featured in a book by a psychoanalyst who worked with such
children. The adult analysis of the picture was that it expressed this girl's
longing for the breast. When, after becoming close to her counsellor, she
drew two white squares in the darkness, this was interpreted as two breasts.
When she then reversed the picture, with a black square now in the middle
of the white paper, this was taken to be her version of the ‘bad breast’ as
opposed to the ‘good breast’.


I laughed myself stupid when I read this. I had drawn the same picture
over and over, writing beside it: ‘Get me the hell out of here.’ This was the
symbolic representation of my trap which was due to the infantile nature
of my unreached emotions. The blackness I had to get to was the jump
between ‘my world’ and ‘the world’, though I had never been able to make
it in one piece. I had learned to fear the complete loss of all attachment to
my emotional self, which happened when I made the jump, and to do this
was the only way which made communication possible. Giving up the
secret of this was simply too deadly. Too many well-meaning people
would have tried mercilessly to drag me through the darkness unprepared,
and killed my emotional self in the process. I may never have died
physically, but physically I had died many times in the effort. I had
multiple fractures of the soul as a result.

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The entire psychiatric outpatients department was bland and colourless.
In a way, that made me safe. It was like a huge room of nothingness
with other little rooms of nothingness dotted along the corridors. Mary's
office had a picture on the wall, two chairs and a desk. The picture was
bland and washed out, the sort that was meant to make patients feel calm. I
remember looking at this picture and finding nothing in it which I could
mentally grasp. Even the colours, which were a mass of bland dull pastels,
blended into one another until the picture was merely a square framed version
of the morning after the night before. Nevertheless, during the day
session, I preferred to look at this when I was speaking rather than to look
at the buzz of daily life going on down below, which only reminded me of
my own lack of normality. I also became preoccupied with Mary's notes.


‘You're not writing anything down about me, are you?’ I'd ask her
anxiously as she scrawled unintelligible notes down on paper. ‘They're not
going to lock me up, are they?’ I'd say over and over again.


Mary's strategy was very appropriate. We would enter her office. She
would sit in her chair and say nothing, and I would mirror her until the
silence became deafening. Then I would bombard her with a series of
statements, posed as questions. She would mirror me, and my fears would
bounce back off her at myself.


I would talk about myself. In the same clinical matter-of-fact manner, I
was able to relate some of the most horrific experiences of my past with
very little feeling for these incidents at all. It was simple. So little of what
had happened around me had actually reached me. Even when anything
happened to my body, it was as though my body was either a mere object
existing in ‘the world’ or, at other times, it was a wall between ‘my world’
within and ‘the world’ outside.


Not surprisingly in the recall of such events, I referred to myself as
‘you’. This was because ‘you’ logically captured my relationship to myself.
One develops an ‘I’ in interaction with ‘the world’. Donna didn't interact;
the characters did. Mary would try to get me to clarify whether I was
implying that the events I was talking about applied to her, as she was the
only ‘you’ in the room. I tried to explain that this was how I described
things. She continued. I reverted to using ‘I’ in a conforming effort to
avoid her pedantic over-interest in the pronouns I was using. Her efforts to
get me to refer to these incidents in a personal manner overlooked the fact
that my use of the word ‘you’ captured the impersonal way in which I had
experienced the incidents at the time they happened. She probably felt
that she had to help me to overcome my depersonalization, as though this
were some recently developed defence reaction. I don't think she realized

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Every so often, Mary would trigger a reaction which wasn't
experienced so objectively: fear of confinement, fear of rejection, fear of
hopelessness and fear of desertion. Such things were generally triggered
by talking about the happy things: my grandparents, my father when I was
small and my little brother up until he was three. These fears, however,
were not the cause of my problem, but the crippling result of my efforts
after I began to participate in and try to reach out in ‘the world’. Such fears
had never, as I remember, caused my withdrawal and psychic retreat. I had
done this even whilst I was with the few people who were honorary
objects in ‘my world’. My retreat was, most often, a response to that which
tested my gentler emotions. I had no trouble with the coarser ones. Willie
took care of those just fine. Bad feelings had no part in ‘my world’.


I had a preoccupation with keeping control, as Mary saw it. I had been
trying to get reassurances from her that I could reach out yet keep control
at the same time. I was trying to reach her in order that she could reach me,
but she stood her ground and tried to make me realize that this would have
to be on her terms. What she didn't realize was that, in laying down such
ground rules, she was giving me the message that my efforts to reach out
weren't good enough. She seemed to be challenging me to compete on her
level. I could only do so mentally detached from my emotions. We were
both hitting brick walls.


I decided I would help her to reach me. I would give up some of the
secrets which formed the strong foundations for ‘my world’. It was as
though I had gone to a summit and put forward the proposal for
disarmament. Mary, in her protected role as the professional, had learned
and leaned on the lessons of professional distance and was not going to
come to the party. As she put it, ‘You came here to see me; I didn't come
here to see you.’ This statement was meant for both our good, I suppose, so
that I would not become too dependent or bring her down to my level, and
so that she would be free of the personal assault often inflicted in the
emotional turmoil of therapy.


My dependency on Mary, however, was the only way she was going to
see the real me. The character of Willie thrived on distance. Carol could
adjust to anything. Donna, however, could never reach out for a hand or
ask for it. That hand simply had to be there being offered unconditionally
on whatever terms it would take to bring Donna out of the darkness of the
cupboard. Carol charmed and chatted. Willie explained, analysed and

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As far as normality was concerned, though Carol and Willie could act
relatively normal, Donna was actually closer along the continuum to
normal. Crippled as they were in ‘her world’, only Donna had emotions
which functioned in ‘her world’.


Carol strutted in one day to give up the secret of Willie's existence.
Willie always took things too seriously, pulling the plug on good times
and pulling everybody into line. Carol seemed to fall into line with the rest
of them and, in the process, disappear. Carol kept the performances going,
but Willie ran the theatre as though it was a prison. Carol's charm,
sociability and cheerfulness simply couldn't co-exist in the face of Willie's
cutting criticisms of the self she portrayed. Carol's solution, as far as
therapy was concerned, was simple: she wanted the good times back. She
wanted her relationship with Chris back to how it was. Mary, though
charmed by her social naïveté, found Carol's goals in need of development.


‘I hear this voice over and over inside my head sometimes,’ said Carol,
referring to Willie, though not willing to give up the secret of who the
voice belonged to or the feelings from which it originated. Mary asked
what the voice was telling her. ‘It tells me, "Don't tell them; they won't
believe you,"’ said Carol, testing the water.


Mary was intrigued, and together they discussed the possible origins of
the message; Mary finally accepting that it was a memory of something my
mother had said.


Of course it had been something my mother had said. The character of
Willie had arisen from Donna's ability to mimic combined with her
mother's ability to taunt and torture her into responding. As Willie, I had
mimicked the words. Unable to acknowledge any communication, Willie
had stored them and retrieved them as appropriate weaponry. Eventually,
however, in frustration, these same weapons were used against the
vulnerable self from which this character sprang. In an effort at automony,
Willie had learned to resent the very vulnerability he had been created to
protect: Donna. Both Carol and Willie had progressed through the various
stages of personality and could have been helped to refine and sheer off
their rough edges if not for the dilemma that they had, in fear of
recognition, developed as antitheses within the same body. There is no

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mary had written me out a prescription. It seemed to me that she had
interpreted my predicament as schizophrenia. Naturally I was insulted. I
had tried so hard to believe, yet feared, that I was mad. Mary had
unknowingly confirmed it.


My friend Robyn had said that people believed what they wanted to
believe. Mary's behaviour had exemplified this. Carol took the tablets
randomly, abusing them as she would any other medication she was given.
On top of about eight tablets she downed a quantity of Cognac, then
called Mary's number at home.


Carol was losing awareness, and I felt the fear of hopelessness come
over me, thinking that permanent damage might have been done; so ironic
to have happened at a time when I was getting help.


Mary answered the phone. She spoke to me casually and calmly. I
found it hard to understand what she was saying, but my mind had latched
on to an image as Mary described how she was playing chess with her cat,
which was prancing about on the covers of her bed. My mind was
replaying a similar image from a Shirley Temple movie. I was again back to
three years old. My voice was switched to ‘automatic pilot’ whilst my sense
of self came over me in waves. It was as though I was flying through myself
every so often. Yet I had this experience before without the effects of drugs
or alcohol. Through this, I had been able to be myself with Mary more
than I ever had before. Perhaps, like years before, it was the distance of the
telephone line which made it possible.


Mary took me off the tablets. The only jot of difference they had made
was that I had become convinced that I could not trust Mary enough to
give up the secrets which could have helped truly to undo some of the
damage in a much more permanent way. The strategy for ‘letting go’ lay
not in my reliving of the events which had gone on in ‘the world’ around
me, but in my giving up the defences which had shielded me from the
effects of these events. These defences consisted of a bookload of secrets
steeped heavily in symbolism as they came well before a time in which
they could be captured by words in any traditional sense.


Mary had obviously little grasp of the world I remembered so clearly
before the invasion of touch and words and expectation to participate. She
set about helping me to tidy up the constructions which had been
suffocatingly built upon faulty undeveloped foundations. I was two years
old, and she had never really seen me.

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had been working in a shop not very far from the hospital. The boss
there had two daughters around my own age and was sexually harassing
me. I found it hard to get along with anyone or serve customers but I managed
to hold things together and get through the day. I had become attached
to one customer, who was an old man who waved hello to me every
day and had become my new grandfather.


Perhaps in latching on to grandfather figures I was trying to continue
in my emotional development where I had left off. Yet at the same time my
grandfather had begun to die for me long before he actually passed away. I
remember always believing that he, like my father, had died when I was
three.


They had both stopped being objects in my world when I was three,
but my father continued to live as one of many of the adults around me and
my grandfather didn't die until I was five, whereupon my grandmother left
to live in the bush.


I can actually remember trying to reach out for my grandfather with my
eyes. It was in this sorrowful unreachable state of longing that I had stood
by his bed when he passed away. I guess it was the sort of state of being one
might expect from a ghost who had come to visit but could not
communicate.


The old man who used to come into the shop I worked in had waved
and said hello; and, though I had looked straight at him, I hadn't seen him,
and he thought I'd ignored him. He came into the shop to buy something
later the same day and ignored me. ‘Hi,’ I said, in an effort to reach out. He
left without saying a word.


I began to panic. My body was operating on ‘automatic pilot’ as I began
to lose sense of what was around me. The shop was a mess of confused
colour and noise. I looked at the people I was working with: strangers. I
didn't know why I was there and had to get out. I grabbed for my bag and
bolted out of the shop. The city street was a nightmare, moving walls of
people, my feet surrounded by feet everywhere. I was running. I pushed
though the swarm of people, the confusing noise of the city screaming in
my ears. I had to get to somewhere safe. I had to get to somewhere familiar.
Mary would help me. Mary was my only hope.


A tram moved in front of me. I shoved people aside like objects
blocking my path and climbed on to the tram. A man walked down the

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘Money,’ he said. I tore open my purse and threw the coins which were
in it at his intruding feet. I got up and ran to the door, banging furiously on
it with my fist. I was trapped, nowhere to go, nowhere to run, nowhere to
hide. I began to cry hysterically, the noise rising up in my own ears until I
could hear nothing else. The door opened.


I jumped out and ran across two intersections, cars screeching, shouting
assaulting my ears. A car had trapped me. I fell forward, momentarily
sprawled across the bonnet.


The shininess of the bonnet had stunned me. I lifted myself up with my
forearms and looked at the two figures behind the glass of the windscreen.
They were pressed against the dashboard of their car, a look of shock upon
their faces.


I had recognized one; he was the state political leader. I pointed at him,
surprised at my recognition, and announced his name, like a scene from my
first days at primary school: naming objects. That was my only moment of
clarity as I rushed through the doors of the hospital's psychiatric
department.


I had forgotten Mary's name. I had forgotten how to get upstairs to
where she worked. I had forgotten how to speak.


I stood there at the reception desk in a state of panic trying to articulate
words and coming out with an unintelligible series of unconnected
half-articulated sounds which only heightened my panic. I began to cry
and hyperventilate.


I felt I was going to drown in my own tears as I looked frantically into
this receptionist's eyes, trying to pronounce Mary's name. She was a large
jolly-looking woman and reminded me of my friend's mother. She
remained patient, calm and friendly as I stood there frantically choking on
sounds, ‘M... Mar... M... Mary,’ I blurted out finally.


The woman got on the phone and called her down. Mary came
downstairs and responded immediately to what she saw. She had tried to
put her arm around me. I had edged away cautiously. She had offered her
hand. I followed her into the lift, shooting glances back over my shoulder
anxiously.

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We entered another office. It was not her usual one. I was taken aback
by the difference, but secure in her company. I sat without saying a
word. She looked at me kindly and reached into her bag and took out a
lolly. My grandfather was back. I was three, and he hadn't yet lost me. I put
the lolly cagily into my mouth as I sat across the room from Mary, like a rat
in the corner. I began to smother a giggle caused by the security of Mary
having found her way into my world. ‘So want to tell me what happened?’
she asked with a rather calm, friendly yet concerned manner. As I began to
reply, I lost all sense of myself as Willie embarrassingly took the stage and
tried to cover the tracks of how significant the events of the last half-hour
had been.


‘What happened to me?’ I asked.


‘You had what is called a panic attack,’ explained Mary. She asked me
what had led up to it, and I told her that I didn't know. She helped me to
retrace my steps, which I had been watching as an observer as Donna ran
helplessly through the city streets.


I explained all the moves I had made. Mary pushed me to examine the
personal significance of the old man. She was pushing me too far. I was
discussing the events like some sort of newsreel broadcaster. The way I saw
it, the old man was simply a friend who had upset me by snubbing me.
Mary delved deeper, enquiring as to whether this had significance in terms
of my background. She was getting too close. There were simply some
answers I was incapable of giving and keeping control. Yes, he stood for
my grandfather. The acknowledgement was made, and Donna sat there
sobbing at the brutality and betrayal of the realization. She sat there
sobbing and, because she could not be touched, there was no-one to
comfort her.


My grandfather's actual death had been discussed. No-one mentioned
the key to the real problem: that he, with everyone else, had died when
Donna was three, at the same time as Willie began to look into people's
eyes with anger and Carol came through the mirror to keep them happy. If
expectation had killed Donna, it was only because she was nowhere near
ready to meet it, whilst her imaginary creations took on life of their own
and succeeded where she failed. The real me was still hypnotized by
colours at a time when Carol learned to dance and Willie learned to fight.
It was as though I had died in ‘the world’. Everyone had died when Donna

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mary seemed to change her tack. It was as though she had decided that
my problems were essentially social rather than simply psychological. We
began to talk about the future. She asked me what I wanted to be.
Antagonistically I replied that I wanted to be a ‘psychiatrist, just like you’.


Mary made me believe that nothing was impossible, and until then I
had never tried to reach so high for the stars. Perhaps, to her mind, the sort
of things I had been through had understandably made me unstable.


I was looking for the answers myself. Our conversations seemed to
jump back and forth until we had reached some agreement that my lack of
social awareness was due to that of my family.


My family's lack of social awareness and their inability to value many
accepted social norms largely stemmed from their poor socio-economic
status and the family's instability. Mary and I seemed to have agreed that
most of my problems were due to the way in which people responded to
me, which was an understandable deduction in view of the fact that I
found most social contact hard to understand or respond to and that I saw
the world very clearly in ‘them and us’ terms.


I decided that I wanted to go back to school. I felt that if I could achieve
my leaving certificate I could get a job in a bank.


People in banks wore uniforms. People who wore uniforms were
respected. I wanted to be respected. Therefore, I wanted to work in a bank.
It didn't seem to make any difference that, at this stage, I had been giving
away more money than the shops I'd been working in had been making or
that I found it difficult even to add or subtract from twenty.


I had been seeing Mary for a year by this stage. I was now eighteen
years old. I had begun to fear the obviousness of my own instability, which
became ever more noticeable and unforgivable with my increasing age. At
times I felt I was in my twenties, at times I was sixteen at the most, and at
other times I was still only three years old. I had been talking about this
and had explained that I still was not ready to leave home, though it had
seemed I'd never had one. I had naïvely stated in a defeated tone that the
problem these days was that no-one wanted to adopt eighteen-year-olds. I
looked up at Mary, who seemed to have tears in her eyes. I was touched that
she was able to feel emotion for my words in a way I had never been able to.

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The world was leaving me behind, and I knew it. The most blatant
example of this was my unemployment, for I had by now been
unemployed for two months and had to face the harsh reality that I was
eighteen, unskilled, with an unstable work-history and the same education
as a fifteen-year-old, whom the employer could pay at almost half the pay
rate. Chris had turned his back on me and, having no friends and no
contact with any family members, Mary had become my whole world.


Mary had helped me to arrange an interview with the careers adviser at
an advanced education college near to where I lived. I believed in her
hopes for me and strutted through the college doors like I had found
myself a new home.


‘No,’ was the reply from the friendly man across the desk, he didn't
think I had much chance of being admitted to school after having missed
so many years. It was not that I'd been away from school for three years
which mattered; it was my wanting to jump the two years I had not
completed and go straight into the final high school year. I explained that
there was no funding for students to return to secondary school and that,
as I had no financial support from my family, I could not afford to make up
the two years I had not completed.


It was suggested that I didn't necessarily have to tell anyone about my
lack of education. It worked. All that was left was to pass an entry
interview. I told the interviewer at the school that I'd been away from
secondary school working and that I only wanted to jump one school year
and said nothing of the two I'd missed. I explained that I had been to many
high schools before I left, and that it might be hard to trace my records. I
emphasized that I'd learned a lot since I'd left secondary school and asked
if that shouldn't count for something. I must have done something right. I
got a letter saying I could start. It was to cost forty dollars.


Mary was over the moon for me. Chris didn't think it was a good idea.
Basically Chris had been secure in the supposed superiority of our
age difference and level of education.


Chris loved to laugh at the way I could be convinced of anything, like
when he told me that all the sand at the beach was made by a machine. I
had put a piece in my mouth and bitten into it at his instruction. ‘See,’ he

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Chris laughed under his breath all along, and it would sometimes be
several months before he'd undo the damage. It wouldn't matter who else
told me; the original teller had to change the story or I would remain
confused and in doubt. By this stage I was eighteen. Chris thought that my
naïveté would change with education. When it came to this sort of naïveté,
he was wrong.


Chris wasn't a complete opportunist. In some ways I think he did care
about me. He had met my father through his business and invited him back
to the flat for a cup of tea.


It was awkward. I hadn't seen much of my father for a few years, but for
the few times when I'd passed his workplace. Nor had I seen my mother.
In the mean time my mother had not mentioned my existence to anyone
who didn't know of me. To those who did, she got out of having to explain
anything by enthusiastically telling them that I was a slut and a drug addict.
Because I was not around to disprove it, this was eventually accepted
by some with sympathy towards her where before had been only blame
and silence.


Here was my father sitting on the couch, in my lounge, in my flat. He
laughed and joked as though he accepted me exactly as I was and always
had. He had such a good time that evening that he invited himself back.


My father and I had never really been allowed to talk to each other
freely since I was about three years old. He had always been barked down
by my mother, who jealously insisted that he would not ‘waffle back at
me’. It was never really assumed that anything I said as a child was much
more than mindless chatter, and my mother was not going to encourage
this by letting someone talk to me on my own level.


My father's actions became his words -- his laugh, the tone of his husky
voice, the way he sang or whistled and the way he would make objects
speak. He would make the cats dance and sing. He would make a
matchbox talk to a cigarette packet. When he came around to the flat, he

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My father had never encouraged me to do anything, though he was
enthusiastic about anything about which I was enthusiastic. I guess he was
a bit like a cross between the real me and Carol. He made my return to
school seem like an adventure, and I began to look forward to it, not just as
an effort to be more like Mary and more acceptable to her, but also as
though it was possibly ‘that special something’ that was missing. I decided
that if my answers were in learning at school, then, come hell or high
water, I was going to find those answers if it killed me.


I had paid my forty dollars. I had taken the subjects I had to in order to
take psychology. I was going to be like Mary. I had also taken music, and
had to take biology and sociology as they were part of the group of
subjects. English was compulsory.


It was my first day. I was as pleased as Punch and looked the part, having
taken great effort to look impressive. The only thing which was missing
was the hanky pinned to my jacket.


I went to biology class. The teacher tried to test our knowledge by
asking what we knew about how plants live. My hand was up in a shot.
‘They eat dirt and drink water,’ I said proudly. Everyone fell about
laughing. They thought I was a comedian. I was deadly serious and didn't
know what they were laughing about. The teacher asked one of the
students to explain the process of photosynthesis. The student did this
with ease. The teacher asked what happens to the plant's waste products.
Unperturbed, my hand was up with all the urgency of a child about to wet
itself. The teacher, wanting to be encouraging, acknowledged me. ‘They
do it into the dirt,’ I said proudly. More laughs. ‘Not really,’ answered the
teacher calmly, keeping a more or less straight face. He got someone else to
explain. By this stage, I think people were unsure as to whether I was
trying to be funny or whether I was a complete moron. To my way of
reasoning, it was simple. I thought my answer was entirely logical and
therefore must have been right. I was a bit bored by the prospect of having
to learn other people's answers off by heart.

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

English was different. There were no truly right or wrong answers. We
were expected to read a lot of novels and poetry, and my long-winded
yet evasive descriptions of what I had got out of what I'd read usually sufficed
for some sort of excuse for an intellectual response which needed refinement
in order to be understood.


English class was about the use of symbolism to convey an impression.
If there was anything I was good at, it was the ability to create pictures out
of words to explain better what might otherwise have been disjointed
strings of black print on white paper.


In English I had something of an advantage in that I never read books
thoroughly and had avoided getting weighed down in the useless little
words, which seemed to steal away the story's meaning. The teacher was
not looking for a blow-by-blow repetition of the books we reviewed, but
an ability to capture the feel of them.


The books would be read out loud in class, from cover to cover.
Sometimes I'd watch and not listen. Sometimes I'd listen to the tone of the
reader's voice in order to try to make out what he or she was
understanding.


English class was also about creative writing. Enthusiastically I wrote
my first piece of work, complete with the usual drawings over the words in
order to capture the feel. The topic was to write about something which
had happened to yourself. Naively I wrote about the tragic events which
had led to my first meeting with Mary. I had drawn tears over the pages.


‘Donna, this is supposed to be a piece of personal writing,’ said the
teacher.


‘It is,’ I replied.


‘Then, who are you writing about?’ she asked.


‘Myself,’ I said confidently.


‘Then, why have you referred to yourself as "you" throughout the
essay?’ she asked. I didn't know why at the time.


‘Is this meant to be a joke?’ asked the teacher, referring to my essay.


‘No,’ I replied, feeling a little bit hurt.


‘What have you done with the full stops and capital letters?’ asked the
teacher.


‘I put them in,’ I replied innocently.


‘Yes, but you've put them in in any old place,’ she said.


‘I put them in so the reader can get some breath,’ I replied with seeming
logic.


‘Are you serious?’ she asked.

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The teacher had drawn a series of sentences upon the blackboard in
order to test my use of punctuation. ‘Put in the full stops and capital
letters,’ she had commanded. I had approached the words upon the
blackboard and put in full stops after every five or so letters, in order that
the reader could breathe. I then put capital letters on all the words in the
sentence which were things, because these were the names of things and
all names had capital letters.


‘I think you are going to need some remedial work,’ said the teacher,
surprised and somewhat shocked.


‘You gonna throw me out?’ demanded Willie.


‘No,’ said the teacher.


I had been looking forward to music. I thought I might have had a
chance to play a piano. The activities in the classroom were very tightly
controlled, and the piano was no exception.


There was no way around this. The piano was kept locked at all times.
We were all told to choose an instrument we would like to learn. I wanted
to play the piano, but was told that I couldn't because I didn't have one at
home to practise on. When it came down to that, I didn't have one of
anything to practise on.


Everyone was informed that they would have to pay for exams which
were required in order to pass the course. The cost of the exams was to be
eight dollars each. It didn't take a genius to work out that someone who
was not even earning enough money to pay their share of the rent could
not afford the eight dollars a throw. I gave up music and took philosophy,
though I had no idea what this was.


I did not last very long in philosophy. With the foulest look on my face,
my fists clenched, my arms stiffly by my sides, I stormed out of the class
after the first few days.


The teacher later asked me what the problem was. ‘They talk bloody
Japanese in there,’ I said. ‘I can't understand a word they are saying.’ He
assured me that if I came back to class he would try not to use ‘too many

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I eventually did learn a lot of big words, and it was also a very free class
where there were really no right or wrong answers, so I didn't find it too
embarrassing.


The point of the class was to discuss the beliefs of certain people, like
Jesus Christ among others. I found it interesting to hear what people
believed in. It was a bit like eavesdropping. The way that people criticized
the ideas of famous people who were not there to stand up for themselves
brought out Willie's protective streak, and he began to argue against
anyone who tried to make a point. The only problem was that when people
would challenge me to what he personally believed he was completely
lost. Willie had learned to argue for any side but still believed in none. For
me, it was all a word game, but it was fun. Besides, my teacher liked me,
and it was like having Mr Reynolds back all over again.


Sociology was all about the effect of the family and education and social
class on making a person who they are. Well, Mary was not a sociologist,
but this seemed to be similar to what she believed. I listened hard and
tried to learn and understand everything that was said.


The last year of therapy had taught me a lot about analysing such
things as well as breaking down therapy into a system which I then used to
try to understand the analyser in order to work out how to be like her.
Social class, education and family seemed to sum it up in a nutshell.


The idea of social class became my first, more impersonal way of
accounting for my feelings of ‘them’ and ‘us’. In part Mary had helped me
to interpret things this way, which was a quite natural yet subjective way of
making sense of my feelings of not belonging in ‘the world’. I certainly
found it too frightening to own up to the secrets of what ‘my world’ versus
‘the world’ really meant, even to myself. I jumped at the opportunity to
examine my dilemma through analysing something similar yet removed
from the real situation.


Mary was my mirror. Mary came from a different class background.
Therefore, the fact that she felt belonging and I didn't must have been due
to this. The fact that she did not dismiss the idea made it true.

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Most of all, I had lived for psychology. Though my teacher was as
hard as nails, I felt that she had some sort of respect for the effort I
was making.


A lot of psychology had to do with finding out how things worked.
The subject of the mind was, for me, like the study of an object which
worked according to a system. Systems were relatively predictable, the sort
of thing that came with guarantees. I could respect this sort of knowledge.


The textbook had a lot of pictures and diagrams which made the rest of
the text easy to follow. There were lists of new big psychological terms to
be memorized, and all of it would add to my ability to take myself apart
and put myself back together.


I had discovered that my mind, too, was a system. If I understood it,
then that was a form of protection. I could learn to explain why I was the
way I was. I could work out whether I was in fact mad or stupid and I could
explain it as though I was that very symbol of intelligence and sanity I so
looked up to: my psychiatrist.


Nevertheless, I was not like Mary. My language was bad, coarse and
uncontrolled. My manners were almost nonexistent. I took everything
extremely literally. And I handed my work in on reused paper.


The psychology teacher came to hand back our work. She had marked
it purely on content rather than on presentation. She got to mine and
announced that she had to give me the highest mark in the class even
though she had never had to read from so disgusting a piece of paper. I had
used white typing fluid to go over an entire page of previous work before
writing my new work on it and handing it in. I was poor, it was true, but it
never occurred to me that the whitener probably cost more than the paper I
had used it on.


My biology teacher had found out that I could not add and subtract. I
had been confused by my earlier high school teacher who had
asked me to show all my working-out on paper. I had my own system up
until then which had worked just fine. When I couldn't learn theirs, I had

The biology teacher had suggested that I use the calculator. I didn't
know how. He tried to show me how it worked. When he asked me to
work out a percentage of something, I tried to find the ‘of’ button and
gave up, furious and frustrated. My teacher realized I had big problems.


My remedial maths teacher was a dream. She was not at all like a
teacher. She had plaited blonde hair and reminded me of Elizabeth, the
girl at the special school fifteen years earlier, whose hair I'd reached out to
touch.


I watched her work things out on paper. A smile would break out across
her face. ‘That's great,’ I'd say. ‘Can you show me how you did that trick?’
She would try to explain that maths was not a series of magic tricks, and I
would sit there trying to believe her.


There were some things I could work out just fine but, unlike
mathematics in school, I could not say how I reached the answers.
Eventually, however, she helped me to learn maths to a reasonable level.
She was very proud of me, and I was very proud of myself.


Mary was very proud of me, too. I still went and saw her every week,
but our sessions were progressively becoming more social than
strictly professional. I wonder if she realized that it was this acceptance
which raised my self-esteem and motivated and inspired me more than
anything else.


There was not really so much to be gained in my learning to be more
social with people in general as I continued to close most of them out and
most of them continued to find me weird.


I had reached out to Mary as somebody I could trust in ‘the world’. She
had accepted me as more than a patient; she had accepted me personally. I
had become attached to her in my own distant way. In my mind she had
become Carol's long-awaited mythical mother. Yet, as all relationships
existed within me rather than between myself and others, there was only
one way to bring this attachment inescapably into my own world. Willie
compulsively set about becoming like this person who symbolized
protection, strength and self-control.

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was swinging from one extreme to the other, as both Carol and Willie
were each other's antithesis. Yet as the trapeze swung ever higher, and each
side developed with my new experiences, I began to catch glimpses of my
true self.


I had stayed in touch with Robyn occasionally. She had recently moved
out of home and had a flat of her own. Like old times, I went and stayed
with her.


Before long, I had managed to find myself another flat, and despite the
fact that I had only two cleaning jobs to support me I managed to talk the
estate agent into renting me the flat and I moved into it on my own.


I had no bed and very little else. I had a couch and a coffee-table from
the Salvation Army, but I had left Chris with almost everything.


One of my neighbours gave me an old radiogram with a loud hum. This
became my best friend.


I was earning twenty dollars a week. The rent on the flat was thirty-five.
I was living on a wish and a prayer, when a part-time job I had applied for
came through just in time.


I cycled down to my new job in the takeaway food-shop almost every
night after school. I ate the scraps that were left over at the end of each
night, and nobody knew that this, and the meals Robyn was supplying,
was the only food I had to eat.


Cheryl, one of the girls I worked with, caught on and, against the
establishment's regulations, began to sneak chicken into the bottom of my
usual take-home cardboard lunch-box full of chips. She would fill up this
box with chips for me each night. One night I got to the bottom of the box
and found pieces of warm roast chicken. I cried.


My father had been coming around. I was grateful for the company. He
would take me out shopping. I would buy my usual packets of jelly and a
packet of rice. He would try to impress the cashiers with the amount of
money he spent on groceries. He even brought chocolate biscuits for his
dog. I paid for my own shopping. He didn't seem to notice my poverty,
and I never drew his attention to it.


One day I had dreamily suggested that he loan me the deposit on a flat
and I would pay the weekly instalments so that I would never again be
homeless. I had seen an advertisement. The deposit was four thousand
dollars. ‘I'd love to,’ he said, ‘but I'd never have that kind of money.’ The

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If learning had made me able to see such cruelty and injustice for the
first time, I wondered if it were really worth it. Then I would think of Mary
and tell myself that I would be like her and never so inhuman and
materialistic as this.


I had passed the school year with average to high marks. It was an incredible
feeling, and Mary and I were both quite over the moon about it. But
with the enthusiasm came the fear of it all ending.


My structured life of relative consistency was coming to an end. I felt
like I was drowning in the uncertainty of the future.


In the midst of the glamour of the celebrations on break-up day I stood
alone, as always, watching people talking with one another. I had not
made many friends among the students and had spent most of my spare
time either alone in the canteen or up in the atmosphere of the college
counselling service where I felt so at home.


A student from my class approached me and surprisingly asked me for
my address.


I had taken on my class as I had taken on my family: a one-woman war
against the masses I vaguely termed ‘them’. In turn I had been shunned
and, even worse, some had approached me on their own but apologized
that they couldn't speak to me in front of their friends who thought I was
mad. Yet this girl had blatantly walked away from her group of friends to
approach me. She gave me her address. I gave her mine.


At Christmas-time, I received a card from this girl. She said that,
although she had never been close to me, she had been inspired by me and
had learned a lot about life by the courage and endurance she had seen me
display. She felt guilty for having had a privileged life and wrote that she
had decided to become a nurse. Tears came to my eyes as I read this, alone
in my empty flat at Christmas. It was the first time I realized that I had
inspired anybody, yet I had done so not though courage but through the
dual motivation of hope and fear.

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had stopped seeing Mary on a professional basis. I had come such a
long way since that first day I had come into the hospital in pieces, mentally,
emotionally and physically.


Our therapy sessions had become coffee sessions. More to the point,
they had become too personal to continue on a purely professional level.
We had decided to stay in touch and, for once in my life, I kept to that
promise.


It was now possible for me to don that uniform I had dreamed of and
walk into a bank teller's position. My maths, though much improved, was
still not up to scratch. It wasn't this, however, which changed my mind. I
had come further than still to believe, so simplistically, that wearing a
uniform would bring me the respect I had so wanted as the foul-mouthed
little girl I had been as a factory worker.


I had survived a year with virtually no income, and my marks qualified
me for entry to a university. There I would be eligible for a tertiary
education allowance which ironically was not available at the time for
secondary level. I decided to go to university.


In some ways Mary had been right. My naïveté, and the way it left me
floundering socially, had been compounded by my lack of education.
On the other hand, my lack of education had covered as a good excuse for
it.


The more educated I became, the wider social group I mixed in, but the
more I came to be seen as eccentric and comical then my newfound
sophistication would slip and I'd do or say something far more
representative of a fool than of a scholar. I still had a few advantages. I was
only nineteen years old and I could always blame it on my class
background.


I had two months to wait until the beginning of university. I had
applied for several courses including youth work, social work, welfare, arts
and interior design.

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The caring professions appealed to that part of me which already had a
strong protective instinct and had come to mirror Mary. Arts appealed to
the indecisive part of me which could not tie itself down to any particular
choice of subject. The one which was probably closest to my truest nature
was the one I took least seriously: interior design. This appealed to that
same part of me which had created miniature worlds in the special school
sixteen years before. This was the part of me which loved to organize
things according to shape, colour and pattern, and fell in love with the
things in people's homes far more than I fell for the people themselves. As
always, in the end, this part of me lost out and the other two struck a
compromise. I took the arts degree and transferred during my second year
to the School of Social Sciences.


Financing my studies didn't seem like it was going to be too much of a
problem. At this stage, fees had not been introduced and the education
allowance seemed only to be a matter of sending in a form. I was wrong. It
took six months for the first payment to come through.


My job at the takeaway had been cut back, and I could no longer afford
my flat. It was three days before New Year's Eve, and I was homeless. I had
tried place after place to get a room in a shared house. Finally some people
took pity on me and called me back as I walked away dejected from yet
another attempt to get a room.


The others were all about ten years older than I was, and I was
completely lost.


I spent New Year's Eve alone in the darkness of this new home. I played
a Bette Midler record called ‘Friends’ and cried at my inability to stay with
any real sense of belonging or attachment and thought about the many
well-meaning people I had walked away from time and time again.


Finally I called up my family. My mother was partying, and strangers
kept grabbing the phone and drunkenly wishing me a Happy New Year. I
could hear the music in the background and could imagine people dancing
and laughing. I wondered what it would be like to be there. I tried to
imagine what it might have felt like if I could just once have felt like part of
things. I hung up and counted the seconds to midnight. ‘Happy New Year,
Donna,’ I said to myself. I burned a candle and, watching it, fell asleep.

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

University had begun, and I had begun to try desperately to get lost in
it all.


I had chosen linguistics and philosophy on the basis of having walked
down the hallway and asked someone what the subject was, asked them if
it was good and asked them if I should take it. The other subject was
sociology, which I took in pursuit of my goal of becoming the same as
Mary.


I was completely lost. The place was far too big with too many walls,
too many people and too many fluorescent lights. I went around
everywhere turning them off. When I didn't, they made me fall asleep.


I slept in the middle of my philosophy classes. When I wasn't sleeping
with my eyes closed, I slept with them open. Eventually the teacher had
said I was quite simply ‘scatty’. I had tried to explain that I couldn't follow
the class timetable, that I couldn't understand the instructions set out in the
handbook and that I couldn't get anything but words out of what I was
reading. The head of the department called me ‘a complete and utter
moron’.


I enjoyed linguistics. Linguistics took language apart and put it back
together. It showed how all language can be broken down into different
types of system. The class was a series of diagrams and cycles. I took to this
like a duck to water.


In sociology I had tried so hard to do well that I had tied myself up in
knots. I had tried to write and wound up giving the teacher a handful of
evasive, jargonistic and disjointed sentences presented as my work.


I was sent off to remedial English. The problem, however, was simply
that expressing my own opinion and beliefs, expressing what I felt, was
simply too threatening. ‘Evasive’, ‘impersonal’ and ‘disjointed’ captured
how I found things very well.


Socially nothing had changed. As always, I had made few friends, and
things remained this way for two years. Carol found it very hard to attend
university, but Willie was a born scholar.


My allowance had come through. It had been six months.


The wait had one saving grace. I had, with the back payments of my
allowance, brought myself an old piano. I learned to love and live for the
time spent with my piano. I began to write music straight away. I could
mimic other people's music with relative ease, but I learned truly to express

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Through my music I began more and more to reach and express my true
self. My music spoke of the things I loved, of the wind and the rain, of
freedom and hope, of happiness in simplicity and of triumph over
confusion. However, the closer I came to bringing myself out, the greater
became the fears which caused serious conflicts between my inner self and
the characters I used to communicate with the outside world.


I had begun to have night terrors again.


I had got up and gone into the bathroom in a sort of dream state. I had
caught a glimpse of the hallway light shining under the closed door of the
flat. I had triggered something, and I felt myself falling, losing a grip on
any sense of the true reality around me.


Like the day I had run out on my job and made my way to the hospital, I
had again forgotten where I was or why I was there. Terror swept over me. I
was on my hands and knees whimpering like a baby. I felt the coldness and
hardness of the tiles and looked at my hands sprawled out on them.


I felt I couldn't breathe. I felt the fear of the unknown which lurked
somewhere in the same room. I whimpered, terrified, lost and helpless. I
curled up, shaking with fear, and rocked like a baby. I tried to be able to
speak but I couldn't find how to. I cried myself back to sleep.


This had disturbed me. I had been through two years of therapy only to
find that I was still vulnerable to these ghostly reminders of a self which
had become buried long ago but refused to die.


I phoned Mary. I told her that I felt there were obviously some things
which I still hadn't sorted out. I felt that these things lay somewhere in my
past and it was time I began to unbury them.

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went around to my mother's house and climbed in through the
laundry window. I sat in the big empty house; the ghosts of the past which
had haunted me through so many nightmares seemed to sit around the
table with me.


The door opened. Voices entered. Not surprised at my behaviour, but
surprised at my presence, they sat down. Willie glared at my mother
hatefully, demanding answers.


I had been to see the doctors who had seen me as a child. I had wanted to
hear what was on my medical records. I had also been to the primary
school I attended and stood at the foot of the tiny staircase which led to the
Psych and Guidance room -- an attic which the school now no longer used.
I had been to my first high school, from which I had disappeared on my
trip to the country. Finally I went to see an aunt who had been a regular
visitor to the house during my early childhood.


My aunty was surprised to see me. It was the first time I'd visited her in
about six years. She had always been very fond of me.


I told her that I had found out that my birth certificate was not a copy of
the original and that the registrar had told me to go and ask my parents to
give me the answers to why this was so. I felt that here was a good place to
start.


I had once been told that my aunty's little girl had overheard a
conversation between her parents about how I could have been her sister. I
drilled my aunty for the answers.


My aunty tried every way out, but the adoption agency had identified
my certificate as an adoption certificate, and I wanted to know why.


My aunty had told me the story behind my mother's neverending
threats to put me in a children's home. My aunty and my uncle had
discussed the possibilities of adopting me. I had, however, been put into
my grandparent's care by my father and, as my grandparents lived in a
shed in our backyard, I remained living at home. Upon the death of my
grandmother, my parents once again became my full custodians.


I looked at my aunty and wondered what it might have been like
growing up with her, with a little sister instead of a little brother. Still, I
wouldn't have swapped my early experiences with my little brother for the
world.

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My aunty was cornered. She told me everything she could remember
from the moment I was born.


When it came to everything that was wrong with me -- my not speaking
to people, my aversion to closeness, my preoccupation with the
unreachable world within my own mind -- to her it was simple: my mother
had caused it.


There was much which justified this opinion, but Willie was examining
what she had said from an objective observer's point of view.


I had not linked the tragedy of what she had seen with the pleasant,
beautiful and hypnotic experiences of mere colour, sensation and sound,
which had held me spellbound until I was about three and a half. I had
been unaware of the pain of sores from unchanged nappies or my mother's
neglect or brutality <i>until</i> I began to become aware of people's efforts at
getting my attention.


The hypnotic fascination I had for the spots in the air left me with very
little sensation of my own body except for the shock and repulsion of the
invasion of physical closeness. Even the comfort I derived from being
picked up by my grandmother I found, not in snuggling up to her, but in
holding on to the chain around her neck or enmeshing my fingers through
her crocheted cardigan.


There was something overwhelming that always seemed too powerful
in giving in to physical touch. It was the threat of losing all sense of
separateness between myself and the other person. Like being eaten up, or
drowned by a tidal wave, fear of touch was the same as fear of death.


My aunty had recalled many memories of my early childhood, but
none had really struck a chord. Willie stood there remembering many of
these, but did so without any feeling for the self who had experienced
them. Then, as my aunty recalled an event when I was three, it triggered
something, and my mind replayed it in all its vividness and horror.


I was back there. I could see my aunty across the room. I could hear the
pleading tone in her voice and sensed danger. I was watching everything
around me happened as though in slow motion though moving far too fast
for me to be able to respond in time.


I looked up at the figure of my mother from the eyes of a three-year-old.
I shot silent glances in the direction of the pleading voice from
across the room. I looked down at the opened tin of spaghetti in front of
me and was aware of the fork in my hand.


I had not heard the introduction: the threat of death against my spilling
a single drop of food. I never connected the repeated slapping with the

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt the dish-cloth being forced into my mouth. It made me gag. I was
choking as I vomited up against it.


The pleading voice was at war with the cutting snarl of my mother's
voice. I glanced upon the black and white striped cord as though it was a
snake. It began to whip my face. I could not cry, or speak or scream. I had
looked at my aunty and collapsed on the cold smooth surface of the table
in front of me and vomited through my nose. I thought I had drowned.


Willie stood there back in the present, with the sound of my aunty's
sobs begging not to make her tell me any more.


There was a risking choke of vomit in my throat and a deafening
scream inside my head which couldn't get out. Willie glared at my aunty,
and the stifled tears had not even made it to his eyes. In a calm, hard and
stilted voice Willie had asked why she had done nothing.


In a state of automation I had gone wandering down the hallway of my
aunty's house.


My cousin's room branched off to one side. I looked through the door.
My cousin had been given the furniture from my old room as a child.
There, on my old bed, was the same bedspread, white with fine yellow
flowers embroidered on it.


The bed was white and curved and smooth, and I could remember
tracing its shape with my hand over and over, creating a continuous cycle. I
could remember biting into the wood and feeling it give way with a fine
crackling sound as the paint chipped away. Against another wall was the
matching dressing-table. Its three folding mirrors seemed to have captured
the ghost of Carol who had stood in front of it many times, whispering the
name Donna and trying to feel it.


The mirror seemed to call me. I approached it and looked deeply into
the eyes of the girl looking back. Willie was gone.


Against the other wall was the wardrobe -- that wardrobe in which
Carol had left me behind. I held my breath in front of it. I ran my fingers
along the pattern of the wardrobe door-handle. I was afraid and felt as
though I was being swept up in a sort of magic. The magic of childhood. I
opened the door, got in. In the darkness, closing the door behind me, I sat
down and curled up in a ball.


I got out of the cupboard and left the room in a hurry. I left my aunty's
house like a cornered rat which had suddenly found a way out. I had begun
to touch upon the answers to what was missing. I went home, curled up in a
ball and rocked for three days.

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had moved to live up in the country, an hour's drive each way from the
university. I enjoyed the drive every day, often getting lost as the road
went around one bend after the other. I often arrived and knew only that I
had driven by the fact that they were my hands on the steering wheel when
I stopped.


It was absolutely delightful, with the smell of the rain on the wind and
the feel of dirt, grass and dead leaves beneath my feet. I had cats and I had a
vegetable garden and a special place to put my piano.


The place I shared sat at the foot of a small mountain. A mountain
stream trickled over a steep path of multicoloured pebbles which nature
had made. There were trees everywhere, and each seemed to have its own
personality. The mountain stream ran down into a creek which ran directly
past the back of this house. I'd cross the creek and throw pebbles on to the
opposite bank, creating an island, then go and sit upon it, safe,
untouchable and alone.


I was twenty-one. My older brother had invited me to his new home as a
special gesture on my birthday. I had insisted that my mother not be
there. This agreed, I consented to go.


My father and younger brother were there, yet it was as though they
were miles away. The atmosphere was strained and eerie.


My younger brother felt like a complete stranger. Sitting there in an
almost adult body, I was disturbed by his presence and could not recognize
him as my brother, though my logic persisted in telling me so.


My father was tense and distant. He was performing with all the
fervour of a circus clown, trying to keep the atmosphere light. My older
brother and I threw cutting remarks across the table at one anther, as Willie
celebrated my twenty-first birthday.


Not unexpectedly, the whole evening came to blows. Willie was trouble
looking for a place to happen and, as it was expected, he got it. Willie
looked at the strangers surrounding me and knew that the sense of
belonging which evaded me would not be found here.

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I began to think a lot about my grandfather. I began to wonder what had
happened to me which had caused him to die in ‘my world’ two years
before he had passed away in ‘the world’. I decided to go to the cemetery
for a visit.


I sat upon his grave. I had not visited it for eleven years. I remembered
how we had gone to visit it when Tom was three. My father had told Tom
that Pop lived in there under the ground. Tom had tried to find a way into
the grave and became frustrated and angry that we were not going to go in.


A leaf tumbled across the grave upon the wind and landed up against
my body. I picked it up and said: ‘Thanks.’


On the way home I pulled into an isolated service station in a semi-rural
suburb. A goat began to nibble at my tyre. I asked the attendant if the goat
would do it any harm. He replied that he was going to do harm to the goat
and said that he was going to shoot the goat that night. ‘No, you're not,’ I
said boldly. ‘I'll take him home with me.’ The attendant was happy to let
me have him.


On the way home I began to cry. My vision was a blur as I watched the
road in front of me through a blanket of tears. After sixteen years it had
suddenly occurred to me that my grandfather had not deliberately
intended to die. I named the goat after my grandfather.


I felt relatively at home living in the house in the country, and the long
drive to uni each day gave me time to dream and to think. Yet I still hadn't
found the mythical sense of home which seemed to evade me. I awoke
one day from a dream which told me that I was not going to stay where I
was.


I had dreamed of a dark-haired young man and, though I had never
met him, I know his name, his family background, the sort of person he
was and his way of life. He and I had a great friendship, the likes of which I
had never had with any man I'd so far lived with.


In the dream I had been sharing a house with this man but was now
sharing a house with a woman who, curiously, I had recognized as an

I dreamed that it was again my birthday. The three of us stood around
the dining-room table draped in an antique lace table-cloth. We had all
raised our glasses (the crystal glasses I had later been given by a friend).
‘Happy Birthday,’ these two had said.


I told a friend about the dream in detail. ‘Looks like I'm leaving,’ I had
said. Two years later, the dream had eventuated, exactly as I had seen and
described, down to the last detail.


I was now in my third year at university. I had caught on to the ability to
make sense of sociology in terms of the experiences I was going
through. I had dropped philosophy and began to choose subjects which
were more closely aligned to the areas in which I thought I might find the
answers I was looking for. I had left behind my compulsion to become like
Mary in the face of something even more valuable. I had begun to try to
find out about myself.


I had become known for my strangely detached and outspoken
viewpoint on the use or lack of use of what I was learning. I had begun to
earn popularity as myself to an extent.


Each side of me had begun to become more closely aligned to my true
self, though still miles apart from one another. It was as though they were
all one continuum and my real self was kept protected, unexpressed,
within the middle. At their extremes, the characters I had become had
denied my existence and lost awareness of me. At other times, they were
depersonalized, communicative, wordly versions of myself which were
able to test out the people and environment for a self which could not
grasp things in such complexity enough to be able to cope.


If my true self were merely my subconscious, then by some tragedy it
hadn't completely gone to sleep. If it were my conscious mind, then it was
like a waking dream state which had not truly woken up. The depth of the
feeling I felt as myself made all else feel empty, manufactured and
two-dimensional by comparison. The world these two communicative
versions of myself endured was, to me, a complexity of confusing and
invasive inflictions. Thus, everything my characters created had to be torn
apart in my effort to break free. Carol's friendships were torn apart and

Bryn was unusual. He stood out from the crowd. He was quiet and solitary,
but there was something more, something quite different. Other
people would speak to me when they wanted to get to know me. Bryn
would simply come and exist within my company. Bryn was able to communicate
but was very hard to reach through the usual kind of communication.
He had sensed a differentness about me, too. As we clicked, the rest
of the world around us disappeared.


Never, since the girl I had met in the park when I was three, had anyone
been able to capture me so totally. I was either in his world or he was in
mine. Perhaps we existed in a world altogether different and, until now, I
had never found any other person who existed in it, too.


Bryn and I simply found ourselves in the same places. We could not say
what we felt; we merely sensed it, and, in the style which the respect for
distance called for, we said nothing.


In fact Bryn and I communicated directly very little at all. We
communicated via our discussion of nature and the things around us,
poems we had read or written and films we had seen. We never shared
what the significance of any of these things may have been for each other.
In fact we spoke to ourselves about such things far more than to each other,
and simply allowed the other person the privilege of listening in.


I began to brush Bryn's hair. He bought me lunch, and we shared the
food on the grass, beneath a special tree. We both found it extremely

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

People said we were in love with each other. I defensively told them not
to degrade what I had with Bryn by any comparison with a usual sort of
relationship.


In the year I had grown so close to Bryn I had never lost my fear and
absolute nervousness at seeing him. Sometimes this had made seeing him a
torture which was almost impossible to tolerate. I stuttered and shook
much of the time. Because he was like me, he had all the right responses
and merely looked into space, never letting it register that he noticed.
Basically such things did not matter, and it was this simple unconditional
acceptance which meant that in each other's company we were not being
there for each other; we were simply ‘being’.


There was no desperateness to reach out and touch each other in ‘the
real world’. The only thing which mattered was that someone had been
able to touch me emotionally within ‘my world’.


One day we silently and without any deliberateness touched hands. I
was terrified. The pain of this emotionally touching touch was almost
more than I could bear. We sat by one another, ignoring the fact our hands
were touching, and allowed ourselves to experience the feeling. I felt as
though I was going to die.


I had given a girl from university a lift home. As we drove past the
special school I had been to as a small child I pointed out that I had gone
there.


‘You couldn't have,’ she said. ‘That's a special school.’


‘What do you mean?’ I asked her.


‘It's a school for special-needs children,’ she explained. ‘My mother
works there as a speech therapist.’


‘It must have changed,’ I said naïvely.


‘No, it's always been a special school,’ she said. ‘You can ask my
mother.’


Bryn and I lay stretched out on the grass. I had told him what this girl
had said. ‘I went to a special school, too,’ Bryn confided. ‘I had been sent
away because my parents thought I was mad,’ he said. He told me how he
spent time in the ‘home’ and that he had had trouble communicating with
people. His parents had thought that he may have been schizophrenic.


Bryn didn't have delusions about the people around him. He did,
however, often feel painfully uncomfortable with them. Bryn was not
tortured by hallucinations, only by his communication problems and his

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The thought was frightening; yet, from what I had read of
schizophrenia, I didn't fit the description of symptoms terribly well.
Though I feared closeness and felt people were invasive, these weren't
deluded or paranoid feelings. Though objects were sometimes reduced to
their more simplistic characteristics of colour, sound and sensation, I never
felt threatened by this.


Though I behaved wildly at times, or with complete complacency at
others, it was not a matter of delusion; it stemmed from a shock reaction
triggered by any type of closeness, from physical proximity to the mental
closeness of understanding.


I had trouble with words, but this wasn't due to disordered thinking
and I never jumbled them up like a tossed salad. I either spoke them as
emotionlessly mimicked repetitions of what other people had said, spoke
with a strange accent, stuttered or found myself unable mentally to form
the words to speak at all. All of these problems were due to a feeling of fear
of the overwhelming intensity of my very untouched emotions.


I had wanted to communicate and had created personas with which I
could communicate and relieve some of my frustration and try to prove my
intelligence and sanity. These, however, were not mythical monsters; they
were the family I had created for myself within my insular and extremely
lonely unreachable world. They served as translators to overcome the
communication problems between ‘the world’ and ‘my world’.


The sensing of a ghost watching me as I allowed people to play on my
characters to which I'd respond accordingly was more like an out-of-body
experience. These had happened for such lengths of time that as an actress
in my body, in a state of automation, I had lost sight of the controls which
could bring me back down to earth. These were extreme versions of the
experiences which have happened to many people and didn't seem
particular to schizophrenics.


I telephoned my father.


‘Why was I sent to that special school?’ I demanded.


‘What special school?’ he said evasively.


‘You know what I'm talking about,’ and named the school to help jog
his memory.

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘Oh, that school,’ he said in sudden realization. I explained what I had
been told by the woman whose mother worked there.


‘What was wrong with me?’ I demanded. ‘Was I mad?’


‘No, listen,’ he said, ‘you were a little bit funny when you were small,
but that was your mother's fault. There's nothing wrong with you.’


‘But what was I like?’ I pleaded. ‘Please, I don't blame anyone. I really
need to know. What was I like?’


‘They thought you were autistic,’ my father said.


I asked him why.


‘Well, you wouldn't let anyone come near you and you talked a bit
funny. You used to go round saying what everyone else said all the time.
But it’s no wonder. Your mother used to hit you and shout at you all the
time. No-one listened to the things you said,’ he explained defeatedly. I
thanked him.


I didn't know what ‘autistic’ really meant. I simply thought it meant
withdrawn. So! I was withdrawn. So what? I knew that all along. I knew
the problems I had with being touched, or people saying kind things to me
or wanting to get to know me. I knew, from my mother, that for a long time
I had only ever repeated the things other people said. I still did not
understand the way that this had affected so many other things in my life. I
decided that I must have been mad and buried my head in psychology
books in order to find out just what it was exactly that I was afflicted with.
None of these books made reference to ‘autism’, and I remained, as before,
in the dark.


I moved back to the city, into the backyard of a shared house, where I
lived in a caravan I had bought for myself. My piano lived inside the house.
I lived out in the back garden with my two cats; I had left my goat where he
belonged, in the mountains.


I spent all of my spare time writing music and I had now begun to write
songs, which began with the inspiration of knowing Bryn. When I wasn't
writing music, I was buried in books on social psychology.


I had closed myself off from Bryn. Unlike my relationship with other
people, he hadn't stopped existing. I simply felt too real in his company
and felt I had to run away. For me this was a clear distinction. There were
some people I left; there were others I ran away from. Problems arose for
me when the people I left tried to hold on to me because they thought I
was running away and the few I ever ran away from saw me as merely
leaving them and felt rejected and discarded. These seemingly subtle
differences arose from striking differences in terms of the emotion I felt at
the time; all or nothing.

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had retreated very strongly into feeling nothing again. The fight to
regain and hold on to my true self had now done a complete turn-around,
and I was not leaving; I was running.


Carol took the stage with a vengeance. This time my character was
positively manic. Life had become a constant barrage of non-stop parties
and laughter and dancing and people. Willie sat in the director's chair.
Carol had turned back the hands of time and was now playing the part of
the perpetual teenager.


I began to spend a lot of time socializing at the university.


Tim lived on campus. When I was first introduced to him I casually
waved hello and couldn't have given two hoots about him one way or the
other. He was tall, dark and was studying medicine as had his parents. He
wasn't terribly impressed by me, either. We simply went on coexisting, and
I had not yet realized that he was the man I'd seen two years before when I
woke up and told my friend about the dream I had had.


Tim was into music; so was I. Somehow I had actually forgotten that I
lived in a caravan in the backyard of that shared house and even that I had a
piano of my own at home. I began to spend a lot of time playing the piano
in the university school room.


Tim and I found each other listening to one another's music. Tim didn't
write very much but played beautifully. Carol gave him the right to
play the songs and music which Donna was never sociable enough to do.
Tim loved the songs and had a beautiful voice. He brought the songs out of
the shadows of Donna's world in which they had been shared with no-one
and brought them out into the light. Carol sang along.


Tim loved the songs as though they were his own and began to relate to
Carol through the music. Somehow Tim had triggered another ‘on’
button, and Donna began to emerge, not wanting to sing the songs any
more and wanting to take the music away from him.


At the same time as I resented him singing my songs, Tim had been able
to capture me with his splendid ability to play my music almost as well as I

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I began to close myself off from people once again. I had moved into a
one-room bungalow with my piano and would only emerge to make
tape-recordings of the songs I was producing week after week. With each
new song, I would disappear to Tim's place to play him a copy of my latest
piece apologetically.


Tim had become my closest friend since Trish when I was seven years
old. I began to sleep in Tim's room beside his bed.


My relationship with Tim was different from that with Bryn. I was not
so afraid of my closeness with Tim; he had an ability to get close to me but
not to capture me in the same way that Bryn had. With Tim, I was still able
to escape into the characters when things got too much, yet when I was
with Tim I felt it was OK to feel only three years old. I felt at times that he
was only three years old, too.


Tim and I became best friends and moved into a house together. From
his room across the hallway, he would sing me to sleep. I let him brush my
hair and invited him into my world.


Tim was the sort of person who accepted people exactly as he found
them. Mentally Tim had his act together, though he was shy of people and,
like me, hid behind a number of very convincing façades. Like me, he had
walked away from every person he had established seemingly close
relationships with. I never became a statistic.


We had established a marvellous sense of home. Everything in it was
our special something or other. It was a three-year-olds paradise. In a
childlike way, I grew to love Tim and he grew to love me. Sometimes we
would talk so much that we would get no sleep.


We had begun to spend every waking moment together. It was the
holidays, and we drove to work together, met for lunch, phoned each other
up to say hello and waited anxiously to see one another when we got
home. The realization of how close we were becoming, as always,
signalled the beginning of the end.


I began to fear Tim. There was a greater sort of depth in Tim's eyes, and
I became consciously aware that I had come to mean a great deal to him.


We had gone dancing together. I felt relatively safe in his company as
though he had the ability to scare off anything which frightened me. As
we were dancing, sudden waves of fear washed over me. I became afraid. I
looked into Tim's eyes searching for a way out of the fear which I could not
express. Tim leaned over and told me that, if there was any woman he
wanted to be with, I was that person.

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was like a slap in the face. I was frozen in time and space. My body
continued to dance, but he had killed off the sense of security I had found
in him in one fell swoop. Tim became quite clearly an adult.


Carol had returned as she had previously been: shallow, sociable and
skilled in the art of superficial adult relationships. The house shook with
laughter and music. Carol sang her heart out, and Donna had disappeared.
Carol had looked up Stella's number in the phone book and invited
around the girl who, in high school, had always used Carol's eccentric
behaviour as an excuse for her own. Stella loved to go out to nightclubs.
Carol dragged Tim along.


‘Karen!’ cried Stella as she made her way across the room to the flamboyant
woman in the leopard-print dress and fur coat. ‘You remember
Karen, don't you?’ said Stella. ‘Remember I took you to meet her when
we were kids?’


‘Hi,’ said Carol, and sat down.


Karen went on and on about men. Her philosophy was simple: all men
were using pigs and it was up to women to get in and use them first. I told
her that I had left them with everything, including many of my own
things. She told me that it was about time I learned a thing or two about
the facts of life.


Karen and Carol both loved gossip. The more this had to do with
relationships, the more fired up became the conversation. The
conversation turned to the topic of Tim. Karen insinuatingly asked about
the situation with Tim, and Carol mirrored her expectations. Karen in her
own perverse way decided to help misguided Carol to devise a
step-by-step plan to ‘capture’ this man once and for all. Carol was not so
aggressive and tried to back down, doubting whether Tim was interested
in anything more than a platonic relationship and falling back on the
excuse that she had already been through enough relationships and didn't
want to ‘make the same mistakes’. Karen interpreted this as lack of
self-confidence and tried to help Carol to ‘send out the right messages’.

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tim was intrigued by Carol's enthusiasm over her new-found friendship
with Karen. He began to visit Karen himself. Carol had introduced
the element of responsibility. Carol was supposed to take
responsibility for helping Tim over his supposed shyness of relationships.
This was a fatal mistake. Responsibility had never been Carol's realm.


The house began to rage with arguments, accusations and long-winded
analytical discussions. Willie, one of whose strongest points was
responsibility, as always won the arguments.


Tim had decided to go and stay at a friend's place and had asked Willie
to come along. Karen called and said this was a great idea and reminded
Willie not to let Tim down, reminding him that, if the situation arose, it
should be responded to as a matter of responsibility in view of Tim's
obvious shyness.


It was a long drive. The room they were to share had a number of beds
in it. Willie asked Tim where to sleep.


Carol chattered mindlessly on the long trip back to the house. She had
become casual and flippant and was in her ‘I'm ready to leave’ mode. Tim
dropped her off at the house and went out.


He had arrived back at the house with a friend to find me packing all of
his things into boxes and placing them inside the door of his room.


‘You're throwing me out,’ he accused.


‘I'm not,’ I had tried to reply, unable to get a word in edgeways. I tried
to explain that I simply couldn't bear to walk around the house with the
feeling of Tim's things closing in on me, making me feel trapped with
nowhere to run. I no longer felt safe in the presence of his things. I didn't
want him to leave. I just didn't want to share my world with him any more.


I wanted things back to the way there were long before, but the
innocence of our relationship had been corrupted and he was now just
another person. He moved out. Eventually Karen moved in.


The final university year had come and gone. I had passed with flying
colours and faced the uncertainty of what to do now that university
had finished. I couldn't bear the thought. University had been my only
consistency throughout the chaos. It gave structure to my life whilst allowing
me the distance of relating via books and theories. It had given me the
independence of choosing what I wanted to learn and to do so in my own
way at my own pace. It had also provided me with a façade of normality

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A brilliant mimic, I was able to capture snapshots of conversation very
much as they had happened. What I had, as Willie, come to understand of
my own evasive sense of belonging and self-expression became the basis
for a theory which accounted for why some people use, abuse or rip off
themselves or others. It was part of the continuing effort to understand all
of these aspects within myself, and I established, in the end, that the same
mechanisms were at work in all people but some people were tied up in
more knots, either mentally, emotionally or socially, than others. It made
me reflect on what Mary had done for me. She had helped me to untie the
mental knots, but the emotional and social ones were way out of sync and
were still haphazardly causing havoc.


For my thesis, I had chosen a supervisor who I felt I could relate to. In
the end it was this very ability to relate to him which almost cost me the
thesis.


I had basically chosen him for the sound of his voice. It was a
characteristic voice which I found I could lose myself in. I didn't have to
close him out as he could go on and on without disturbing me. Secondary
to this, his way of seeing the world did not appear to be too different from
mine. He questioned the idea of any truly unquestionable reality, saw all
things as relative and also had a strong identification with his
working-class background which gave him some understanding of what it
was like to sense a ‘them’ and ‘us’.


Throughout the course of my writing this thesis, my behaviour was
becoming more and more bizarre. I was extremely possessive of my work,
refusing to show him any fragment of what I had been doing. I became
extremely evasive in any personal conversation on where my life fitted into
my pursuit of this particular topic. This supervisor pursued these answers
relentlessly, causing me to answer him with riddles. If I could have lied, it
would have been easy, but any lie would have given away more about what
I had to hide than my ability to hide and run away.


My supervisor may have been sensitive but he was also sarcastic and at
times cunning in trying to combat my evasiveness. He was, I believe, both
surprised and amused by the way in which his sarcasm went over my head.
Though I was clever in other ways, the subtlety of prompts and jibes was
beyond my grasp. He eventually realized this and asked me in no uncertain

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He had tried hard to reach me, but I was running as fast as I could. The
often dangerous world in which I had immersed myself didn't help, and I
sometimes wonder if I set myself up for turmoil and danger in an effort to
shock myself into feeling something.


I think my supervisor had wondered about this, too. He had noticed the
constant changes in my character, the most basic reflection of which was
the way I dressed. He had asked me if I noticed this.


Like the characters I portrayed, my dress reflected my personality and
its constant changes.


As a self who would rather have disappeared, I dressed uncharacteristically
in hand-me-downs which so appropriately expressed
nothing of who I was. This was truest to me. On other days I would dress
conservatively, yet old-fashioned, like a person old before her time; a self
who had fought too many wars. Then, in striking contrast to this, I would
dress loudly and provocatively. Like some walking piece of art, a mobile
performance, I would strut into my supervisor's office; a self who had no
feelings to be reached and no depth to be challenged.


My supervisor's caring concern did nothing for my thesis, though it did
a lot for me. He was the one uninvolved mirror in my life at that time. The
me his comments had captured stayed with me as snapshots in a photo
album I looked through to remind myself of who, and where, I had been.


I had, for fear of him seeing it, avoided writing up the final draft, or
handing it in, until the last possible moment. I had cut from it all richness
of expression with the skill of a literary surgeon. There was not a personal
element in it, except for a brief dedication. The animated extracts of
information I had used to illuminate the text stood out as some perverse
mockery of my own complete inability to expose myself emotionally to a
waiting audience. The thesis was as clinical and sterile as a surgeon's
instrument-cabinet. Typically it reflected my own separation from ‘the
world’ and any part of myself which, as my characters, related to it.


Tim had begun to come around to the house again, trying to salvage the
friendship I had torn apart before his eyes. We fought furiously, him
usually coming off second-best (though this was more indicative of the

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was my birthday. Tim had been invited over to celebrate. Carol,
Karen and Tim stood around Karen's dining-table, which was draped
elegantly with an antique lace table-cloth. The wine was poured into the
crystal glasses which I had been given for my twenty-first birthday. The
glasses were raised in a toast. ‘Happy Birthday,’ came the announcement as
the entire scene began to run in slow motion. Awake, yet in a dream state,
Donna stood, frozen. My mouth hung open in shock. I had seen it all
before, a few years ago, in a dream, exactly like this. Just when Carol had
begun to think she was relatively normal, a realization came crashing
down on her world. There was something very strange about the way this
sort of thing continued to happen.


The university year had finished. I was, at one stage, interested in continuing
even further, but my fear of the exposing potential of
long-term friendships was simply too great. My supervisor had, in my final
week, begun to see me as I truly was.


I wondered if he realized, as I handed him a goodbye gift: a riddle-like
poem. I was terribly nervous. This was a huge effort at reaching out. The
poem was a gesture to pay him back for his interest, patience and support.
Its content was an attempt to explain the dilemma I was living and trying
to overcome. He had accepted the gift gratefully. I had truly wished he had
accepted it with relative indifference. The acceptance of compliments or
gratitude was something I had not yet quite mastered.


I was terribly afraid of what I was going to do next. I had done a lot of
voluntary work in a variety of settings. This had given me some concrete
social work experience within related fields to combine with everything I
had studied and allow me to try for a ‘professional’ job. I decided to try for
social work positions. My many personal and professional references
made for an impressive CV. It wasn't long before I was offered two jobs
and had the advantage of choosing. One was working with children, a lot
of which I had already done. The other was to work in a housing service
for homeless people. I chose the latter.

David was one of the hundreds of people I met in this new job, and
struck me as being the most unfortunate. He was the same age as me,
yet was climbing as desperately towards self-ruin as I was trying to climb
out of it. He appeared to symbolize who I had been at my most hopeless.
Willie's protective instincts had come to the fore, and Mary's role as psychiatrist
was about to be put into practice. My office carried an open invitation
for anyone who wanted to come in and discuss the hopes, the fears
and the dreams so many of them were drowning in alcohol daily. David
called this office his second home, and Willie's sense of self-importance
soared.


The staff at the centre were disturbed by my approach. I was told that
my approach was all wrong and that I had achieved a higher profile among
the clientele in two weeks than the social worker had achieved in two
years. Furthermore, it was insisted upon that I learn to socialize with the
professionals and was told to spend my lunch-hour up in the staff room.
Willie had never had much respect for authority and threw the job in after
two weeks.


David had sobered up in an effort to gain Willie's respect. It didn't gain
respect but it boosted Willie's sense of self-importance and adequacy as
some sort of social worker. David had heard I'd thrown my job in. I said
goodbye and gave him my number in case he needed to talk some time.


It wasn't long before he called, creating a drama that he'd been thrown
out and needed a place to stay. Willie, who had spent a lot of time picking
up other homeless representations of socially naïve Carols, came to the
rescue and offered David a place to stay in the shed out the back, so
representative of the sheds and garages Carol had found shelter in years
before.


David was a compulsive liar. In fact he was a compulsive, full stop.
Immensely insecure, David used every piece of emotional blackmail in the
book. Willie, who could run rings around others on an intellectual level,
was completely lost when it came to tackling the emotional problems of
others. Willie's detached and objective approach was being shot down in
flames by this prize manipulator who operated on a far more underhand
and emotional level. Carol, though without empathy, could appear to
possess it. Her mental shallowness and social naïveté made her a prime
target. She was about to be taken to hell and back.

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Within each of us are the survival mechanisms of fight and flight.
Willie was the personification of my response to fears outside myself
- my fight response. Carol embodied my flight response: to run from
fears which were sensed as coming from within -- fear of emotion.


The new relationship which Tim and I had forged was again that of two
innocent children. Tim tried hard to keep a grip on it. Again, at its highest
moments, my fear of closeness came to the fore and Carol emerged ready
to run.


Tim had come around to see me. Unable to cope with the exposure of
my feelings in front of anyone else, let alone an opportunist like David, I
hid behind Carol, who tried to entertain and keep everyone laughing.


David was laughing. He had watched as Tim brought me flowers at
work. He had listened as I spoke to Tim on the phone. He had been
waiting for a chance to shoot Tim down in flames.


‘Do you know we're getting engaged?’ David announced flippantly.


Tim's jaw dropped. His face hardened. Here was tenseness in his voice
as he said in a controlled voice: ‘Congratulations.’


It was the first I'd heard of this proposal. I knew it was a game, but had I
understood at that point the intentional cruelty or felt at ease with the
depth of genuine feeling Tim had for me and I for him I would have
grabbed Tim by the hand and run away from this monster who so
cunningly disguised himself as an admirer.


Inside I was screaming. Inside I was reaching out to Tim. On the
outside Carol held the stage, laughing and talking trivia and ignoring the
fact that David was cruelly rubbing Tim's face in the dirt. The scream and
the tears and the desperation never registered in Carol's eyes. They were
always shallow. They were always smiling. They were always dead.


Karen saw David for the worm that he was. She tried to warn me, saying
she wanted him out. Willie, protecting him from being thrown
out in the street, fought her accusations desperately. Stuck in time, Willie
was mentally protecting the mental image of Carol from a life on the
streets; the same life which had led to her sellout as a domestic prostitute to
men who didn't care that she was only a child.


I had a car, a piano and a small amount of money. Karen, in fury at my
blindness, violently created dividing-lines through the house, making it
impossible to continue living there. She had condemned me to the very

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

David and I lived in the garage of a friend's house, on a makeshift bed
beneath greasy black wooden beams and spider webs. Carol settled into
her role of domestic prostitute once again. As always, the eternal optimist
in the face of adversity, she made light of the situation. David mocked her
stupidity and dictated the plan of action. Carol followed blindly.


David didn't want to work. He was recovering. David wanted,
however, to see the rest of the country, and the money from the sale of my
things and my care were going to be his means of doing it.


David was quite at home in his position of torturer. He insisted that I
could do nothing without his permission. Even then he wanted to follow
me. I couldn't go to the shop on my own. I couldn't talk to anybody unless
he was there. I couldn't even go the toilet on my own. He would wait for
me outside the door and tell me off if I took too long. I was once again the
poor, uneducated, battered wife.


Everybody David met despised him, which meant that I was unable to
talk to anybody else, even if I found the courage, as nobody could tolerate
his company long enough to build up a friendship with me.


I began to think of Tim, and big silent tears would stream down my
face.


‘What's wrong with you?’ David would demand.


‘Nothing,’ I'd reply, painting a smile across my face. I needed to talk to
Tim so desperately, and it was only thoughts of him which kept me going.
Ironically, it was fear of the closeness I felt for him that also kept me from
going back.


We had reached the other side of Australia. I was isolated, alone and
broke. It was the wet season in the tropics of the top end of Australia.
I had become extremely weak, unable even to go walking for more than a
few minutes at a time. I would begin to gasp for breath and feel faint. David
had used my money for this joyride to visit his sister, and having run
out of the money necessary to get my car to his destination he refused to
work.


We were living in a dredge of a caravan park, but had to find cheaper
accommodation. In the search from boarding house to boarding house a

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Rent was to be free in exchange for teaching Carlos. It was to be fairly
straightforward, I thought. As it turned out, Carlos was ten years old and
almost completely illiterate in both his native language, Greek, and in
English.


I was very weak and had to spend the entire day in bed in order to get
the energy to speak for the two-hour lesson per day with Carlos. I didn't
know it at the time, but I was suffering severely from multiple food
allergies and was subsequently suffering from malnutrition; getting
virtually no vitamins from anything I was eating.


Carlos was a delightful boy. I grew quite fond of him, and he and his
sister grew quite fond of me. David was extremely jealous, but rent was
rent. Carlos was coming along well, and even in my weakened state Carlos
had aroused a sense of pride in me which conjured up the side of me I
would need to get me out of this mess. I found the courage to write to Tim.


It was a stilted letter, with no return address. Nevertheless, my
acknowledgement that I had had courage prompted me to take things one
step further. I told David I was leaving. David, who'd had it pretty good so
far, decided to come with me. I had to sell my car to cover the cost of both
our tickets. I was returning to my own city.


We took a room in the backyard of a house. It was cramped and small,
but I was back home in my own city. I telephoned Tim's mother and
told her I was back. She asked if I wanted to see Tim. I told her I wasn't
sure yet. She told me that Tim had been depressed after I left and that she
was sure he'd be glad to know that I was back. I told her to tell him that I
was doing fine and hung up.


After a few weeks I again rang Tim's mother. She had given him the
message. She went on to tell me that he had just moved in with someone.
She was upset about this as he'd already been through a lot and he hadn't
known this person very long. I told her to give him my address.


Eventually Tim got in touch. We met in a takeaway -- all four of us. It
was awkward. Tim and his partner sat on one side, David and I on the
other. We tried hard not to show how glad we were to see each other once
again, but agreed to stay in touch.

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had begun to slap myself and pull out my own hair. I wanted
desperately to get out of my own body. To leave it there to be stomped on,
used and abused as its invaders so chose. I was annoyed at this physical
body and the way it held me in like the walls of an impenetrable prison. It
seemed to me more than useless. I screamed, and my own ears were
deafened, but no sound ever came out. I pleaded, but nothing got past the
lips of my painted smile and the dead look in my eyes. I had a capacity for
closeness, but my intense relentless fear of it made closeness a sort of
mocking unreachable dream. This was the price of what may have been
termed my autism. It went far deeper than the simplistic blanket
description of ‘withdrawn’.


I had managed to cry out to Tim for help. Tim came with his partner. It
seemed a cruel fate that another adult should have been so threatened by a
child's closeness, for although I was an adult I was an adult trapped in a
child's insecurity.


Tim responded like a policemen dealing with a domestic dispute.
David had said I was completely mad. I had tried to explain what had
happened. It was no use; everyone was a thousand miles away, and no
sound came out.


I again took a job in a factory. The money I earned helped me to buy a
caravan.


David had long since destroyed my friendship with Tim; and Tim,
whose life in some ways was running parallel to mine, had begun to give
up the battle to save it, convinced that he had obviously not meant as much
to me as he had thought.


David and I had moved into the caravan and again begun to travel.


I began secretly to write to and phone Tim now that my transience
made our closeness less threatening. Tim's letters were written as evasively
as my own. They were messages of holding on to oneself and not blaming
oneself for the compulsive need to run away. I knew those letters off by
heart. In the end it was the strength these had given me, and the hope that
despite my compulsion to behave in contradiction to all I was there was
still one person who had never given up on me, and had almost always
continued to fight to see me for who I truly was, that helped me to reach a
decision. One evening, in the dead of night, I put a plan into action. I was
leaving David.


I had run away, into the night, in another strange city, surrounded by
strangers. I had spoken to a stranger on a telephone advice service who had
fortunately challenged my ability to have the guts to leave. This was
exactly what I needed in order to fight back and have something to prove. I

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had instructed David to meet me at a particular place in the city at a
particular time the next day. I sneaked away back to the car I had parked,
lights out, motor running. I drove to the other side of this strange city,
parked the car and fell asleep, cold, hungry and homeless.


The next day I returned to the caravan at the time I had told David to
meet me elsewhere. I took all of my personal belongings and left
everything else, including the caravan, for him to keep and never bother
me again. I had wasted a year and a half of my life with this beast.
Whatever I lost, it was worth it.


I drove through the night until I was seeing double. I was extremely
tired and hungry and had only enough money to get back to my own state,
if that. I slept in the car, in a carpark, parked next to a trailer full of barking
dogs. I was the happiest I had been since I had lived with Tim in the early
days. For once, this was a real ‘happy’. I felt it inside and, for a change, it
was reflected by the expression on my face, which was peaceful.


I arrivad at Tim's place by surprise. Tim's partner was understanding
about my predicament; aware of everything I had gone through and the
strength of the friendship between Tim and me. I stayed long enough to
get a job and a place to live and left as quietly as I came.


I moved into a shared house in a beautiful semi-rural area far across the
other side of town from Tim. The owner of the house had a little girl who
was two. The little girl responded to me, and I began to open up and come
out of my shell. I began to go out on my own. I had never done this as my
real self and, unlike Carol, I had no intention of being social.


A group of young men sat across from me and began to try to talk to me.
They were Irish, and I couldn't understand a word they were saying,
and when they persisted I told them so. One of them looked into my eyes
intently. He was silent and signalled in the direction of the dance-floor
with his eyes. I silently responded.

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We went to his friend's place. It seemed quite acceptable to me to be in
company and yet refuse to socialize. My answers were short and invited no
conversation as I examined my surroundings. His friends gave up trying to
speak to me. He hardly spoke and appeared at ease and intrigued by my
silence and detachment, so there was no real threat.


Neither of us wanted to be in a relationship. Our desire simply to be in
each other's company suited both of us just fine. We knew we did not want
to feel attachment or any sort of mental familiarity with one another. This
was the most equal, undemanding and unstressful relationship I had so far
ever had. In silence and unfamiliarity it was also the only way in which I
could unthreateningly indulge in what pleasure there was to be gained
from being touched.


This man was dyslexic and had similar communication problems to the
ones I had. What we lived was simply irrelevant. Most of it would have
been in contradiction to my real self in any case. We kept all conversation
to a minimum and communicated largely through sense. Our
overwhelming sensitivity meant that the relationship was far more sensual
than sexual. We saw one another for three months. In his own way, he
began to try to get to know me. We began to lose touch.


I again began to become very ill. The asthma and muscular pains I'd suffered
from when I was with David were back. I began to fall asleep in
the middle of the day for hours at a time, and nothing seemed able to wake
me. Again, I would find that I had been staring into space, doing nothing
for hours at a time.


My ability to concentrate on anything was very poor. I would watch the
television with no conception of what I was seeing but for a series of
colours, patterns and movement. The only thing which seemed able to
snap me out of this was the television commercials whose simplistic tunes
and jingles would stick in my mind, being replayed for hours, days or even
weeks on end.


One day I left a building through the same door I had come in, yet I
found that somehow the building had changed places. It was not on the
same side of the street as before. I walked back into the building, turning
my back on the street outside, then I walked back out again. It was still on
the other side of the street to the way it had been when I had originally
gone in.

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was afraid. I asked what the name of the street was. It was the same
street. I had parked my car further down the street, but now, with no sense
of direction whatsoever, I had no idea where it might be.


‘Please, which way is Mitchell Street?’ I asked, though I had grown up
in this city and knew the streets like the back of my hand.


‘Over there,’ said the voice, pointing.


I followed the direction of the arm and became alarmed. How on earth
did Mitchell Street get down there?


I began to cry; I was afraid. A stranger's voice asked me what was
wrong.


‘I'm lost,’ I explained. ‘I have no idea how to find my car.’


‘What sort of car is it?’ said the voice. I explained, saying that I had
parked it in the same street I was standing in but could not say in which
direction. The man who was helping me had spotted it. I ran to my car.


The whole world seemed to have turned itself upside down, inside out
and back to front. Everything was like a mirror image of what it had been
when I had entered the building.


I climbed into my car and sat there frightened. I knew the names of the
streets, and had never had any trouble finding my way around. But now I
knew only to drive in the direction of street names which I knew


Just like driving into a mirror image, I found myself, street after street,
at the wrong end to the direction I wanted to go. I ended up on the wrong
side of town completely. Instead of driving towards home, I had, as in a
mirror, driven away from it. All things had become their opposite.


This happened on and off for two days. I became terribly afraid that I
had gone mad. I realized that, whether I was mad of not, I ought to be in a
job where I was standing in one place all day


I approached a theatrical shop. I had fallen in love with the wall of
feather, velvet and sequin masks, the wigs of every length and style, and
the huge life-sized bear costume which was suspended from the ceiling by
string and stood by the counter threatening customers. I could relate to
that.


The owner wanted someone with five years’ retail experience. Carol
sold her on the value of an outgoing personality and a terrific ability to
relate to the desirability of the intriguing bits and bobs around the store. It

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Carol dressed up in rabbit ears and furry costumes day in and day out.
Out of curiosity children would drag their parents into the store, and often
the parents would be conned into buying something I was wearing. One
day I even got into the very expensive bear suit and went dancing about in
the street. A man came in and bought it to take back to the bush town he
was from to surprise his friends and entertain his children.


The shop's sales doubled, despite the fact that I had continually to be
told to pay more attention to the customers than to the compulsive
rearrangement of the merchandise. One little girl, captured by the charm
of my evasiveness, came up to me and tapped my arm.


‘Are you a real fairy?’ she asked.


‘Yes,’ I said.


‘Can I touch you to see if you are real?’ she added.


‘I'm sorry.’ I had said. ‘I may disappear if you touch me.’


There is no doubt a place for everyone, I suppose.


The entire roof of this shop was a mass of fluorescent lights. I was
becoming terribly ill, finding it hard at times even to find the energy to lift
an arm. I began to wear a sun visor, and this prevented me from falling
asleep under the effect of the lights.


My boss thought I was completely mad, but I suited the nature of the
shop and my eccentricity seemed to attract customers.


I began to get rheumatic pains, and my muscles were so tense that I tore
a muscle in my arm simply by reaching out for something. I began to turn
bluish, tremble and then faint. I also had constant dark circles under my
eyes. I had begun to take vitamins, but they did not seem to help.


I had the same symptoms as a child; my gums bled, and I bruised at the
slightest touch. In desperation I once again went looking to find what
vitamin I might still be missing which might patch me up.


The naturopath, instead of selling me any more vitamins, asked if there
was a particular type of food I ate all the time. This sounded like a
strange question, and she explained to me that my symptoms may have
been due to a lack of vitamins but that this deficiency may have been a
problem of absorption. She explained that it may have been possible that I
was suffering from intolerance to various food substances and that some of

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the mean time I went off some of the foods I was eating so
compulsively. After dropping potatoes and tomatoes, my rheumatism and
muscular trouble went away for the first time in months. I dropped dairy
foods, and the dark circles under my eyes and my asthma went. I cut down
on my high refined-sugar intake, and the fainting and tremors went to a
large extent. At the same time I began to binge on a whole range of other
foods, and by the time my appointment with the allergy clinic came up I
had developed problems with some of these foods, too.


I eventually attended two clinics. Both of the clinics were established
and run by medical practitioners who had undertaken their own private
research into the effects of diet on health.


The first of these clinics operated along the lines of Western medicine,
the second along the lines of Eastern medicine. As very few doctors were
well read on the subject of food intolerance, the appointments were very
expensive and only partially covered by government funds.


I had previously spend the last few years on and off asthma medication
-- me going off it, and the doctors telling me I was foolish and putting me
back on it.


In previous years the so-called hospital specialists had given me
‘scratch tests’, whereby drops of a substance are placed on the skin in order
to see if the skin reacts allergically. On the basis of these tests I was
dismissed as not suffering from allergies. However, I had only been tested
for airborne allergens.


Intolerance to different foods can cause allergic reaction in different
parts of the body. In my case my skin was not the ‘target organ’ for my
particular allergic reactions. It was not until the clinic used the method of
injecting me with various food substances that it was discovered that I was
indeed suffering from extreme multiple food allergies.


At the first clinic, using a series of blind tests, they found that I was
allergic to all meat accept beef, all dairy products, eggs, soy products,

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What this effectively meant was that I had to eat every two hours in
order to avoid a sudden and dramatic drop in my blood-sugar level. Any
degree of excitement only exacerbated this, causing me to tremble, turn
blue and faint as my nervous system responded to a sudden and dangerous
plummet in my blood-sugar level. Every step on the way down was a
step-by-step change in my conscious awareness of my surroundings.
Furthermore, in response to this condition, my body was releasing its own
adrenalin, causing me to speed up, which I usually channelled into the
character of Carol.


I had previously lived on an extremely high sugar diet. I was now
required to maintain a diabetic diet. After three days off sugar, I had
extreme and violent withdrawal reactions.


Though I had rid myself of chronic rheumatism and asthma, there was
still something triggering changes in my behaviour. I heard of another
clinic and decided to try it.


The other clinic used a method of testing which operated along some
of the principles of acupuncture. They used electronic equipment to test
the effect of food chemicals upon the body's electro-magnetic field. I was
found to be allergic to a group of chemicals called phenolics and
salicylates which are common to many fruits, vegetables, herbs, spices and
almost all pre-packaged foods. In particular, my extreme intolerance of
phenolics was found to be twice as high as that usually considered to be a
high reading.


Although many of these foods contain substances beneficial to most
people, these same substances were slowly poisoning me and robbing my
body of vitamins in an effort to try to cope. At this clinic I was tested, both
for vitamins I was lacking and for my ability to tolerate them regardless of
the beneficial properties they may have had for others who had not
become so allergically sensitized.


Sticking to this diet was near-impossible, but work had also become
impossible owing to ill health and I was worried about the threat of
homelessness, should I get sick.


I stayed on the diet for a year, avoiding most foods which I knew to
contain the proteins and properties to which I was allergic. This meant that
my diet consisted, almost entirely, of home-made, mostly grain, foods.


After the first few weeks, my boss was amazed. I had begun to talk
calmly and patiently to the customers, even when they became impatient
with me. My mood-swings had become less pronounced, and my ability to

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had become a far quieter person. I was afraid of what seemed like a new
me. It was as though I had stepped into a new pair of shoes with an eerie
old feeling about them. I had not yet fully acknowledged that Donna was
finally on her way out into ‘the world’. I wanted desperately to escape back
into my characters. I needed to destroy all security I had built up in order to
create enough stress to bring on the anxiety which had always been the
boundless energy behind my characters. A friend of mine was going to
England. Whoever I was, I decided I was going to England, too. I packed
my things and told Tim and Mary I was leaving the country.


Though I had been invited to Mary's house, she had never been invited
to mine. I decided that, in spite of my fear, I was finally going to invite her
to my place.


Mary arrived, and I darted around the room like a nervous puppy. I
hardly sat in one place all night. Nevertheless, I had known Mary for nine
years by this stage, and it was a major achievement for me to have found
the courage to allow her into this now depersonalized flat to view a
snapshot of my personal life. At the time, I still found it near-impossible to
be myself. My characters had always been so much more impressive than I.


Saying goodbye to Tim was another matter. Tim had long since left the
partner he was living with. He was as close to me as he had ever been. He
knew that in calling him up after not having seen him for some time I was
again, in my own way, showing him that I felt something for him. The
problem was that as myself I felt too much for everything and had,
therefore, to run away. Had I not had the escape of being led off to
England, I would not, under such emotional circumstances, have been able
to face seeing Tim. I had always to have a door to run out of.


I told both Tim and Mary that I wanted no-one to come and see me off
at the airport and told Tim that he was not to come to my house with any
last goodbyes.

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tim ignored me. He was the only person who knew that Donna didn't
really want to go. Yet Tim was in many ways like me; he knew I was
compelled to go.


Tim arrived on the day I was to leave. He arrived at the flat with a
prepared breakfast and a vulnerable look in his eyes. I felt exposed and
trapped. Willie snapped at him. Tim didn't care; this was too important.


I so admired Tim's courage as he tried hard to ignore Willie's hateful
and cutting remarks. He was told he wasn't wanted and asked to go. Tim
took my hand and kissed me gently. He was pushed away. Tim stood
watching me at war within myself, all because I couldn't stand the pain of
feeling closeness. He left. I left for England.


I looked through the many bags and tins of little treasures which I had
packed for transportation in a tea-chest. I piled in bits of coloured tin
foil, buttons, ribbons, sequins and bits of coloured glass which had been
with me all my life.


In the end the tea-chest lid wouldn't go down, and I sorted through all
of my bits several times before weeding out the ones I was most taken by or
attached to. I folded and packed all the lesser-loved bits neatly into a
carrier-bag and thought of who I could give them too.


The places, experiences and people I had become attached to, my sense
of security and my ability to make sense of the relationships between
things existed within these collections. I could lay everything out in
categories and grasp the concept of order, consistency and belonging
despite my inner lack of it. I could see what role each thing had in relation
to the next, unlike my relationships with people. Unlike my life, all my
special things had their own undeniable place within the scheme of things.


No matter how much people told me that I fitted in or was accepted, I
couldn't feel it. I once wrote: ‘Words on the wind, when they're calling you
in, the words, have no meaning when the thoughts have no feelings.’
When I set up my bits and pieces, I could visually grasp the elusive sense of
belonging I could never feel with people, and through this could give
myself hope that it would one day be possible. I could see it, laid out in
front of me in categories of things which could be arranged so as slowly
and gently to blend into one another in some concrete, observable and
totally orderly way.

I had just had my twenty-sixth birthday. It was the usual inner
loneliness in an even lonelier place. After three months in England my
precious bits arrived. I spend some time looking through them before
closing the lid on them once more. I did not put any around the room, I did
not show them off or try to explain their individual meaning -- my
language. I lived far more in my things than I did in my body. Leaving
them packed away, uncorrupted, meant that they were retrievable later
when it would be safe yet again to get close to myself and my feelings.


My mind was such that any sensing of fear over what I was to say made
it impossible to express directly. The tricks of the mind I would play on
myself in order to communicate condemned me to be judged by them.


I was convincing my audience of the complete antithesis to what I truly
was. What they saw as shallow, I experienced as deep. What they saw as
clever, I found simple to reel off without any personal significance. Whilst
people around me judged me by their eyes and ears, I was screaming out
from beneath the empty façade of my shell to get them to feel who I was; to
close their eyes and their ears, and to try to sense me.


I found that people were usually blinded by their own insecurities or
egotism or selfishness. People seemed so ignorant in their self-assured
black-and-white conception of ‘normality’. Every so often, however,
someone would wonder whether others had something to learn from me
in trying to understand my differentness. Some people could sense the
courage it took to teach myself so many things like the music I wrote with
such depth and passion. Mary and Tim fell into this category.


I had seen an advertisement to do comedy. I had already dabbled in this,
writing comical mockeries of the world around me. I met the manager,
who was running courses in the hope of discovering new performers. He
found me somehow naturally funny when I was least trying to be. We
worked together to script some of these things, and he offered me the
course free if I'd do short fill-ins for his paid comedians. Comedy was a
means of getting people to experience my world. It made them laugh
where they might otherwise cry. Comedy is most truly about alienation.
Both Carol and Willie, my fear mechanisms embodied, were right at home
with alienation. The fear of self-exposure was a mechanism by which I
could shock myself. This fear came mostly from within. Armed only with a
smile and a comedy script based on my childhood, Carol took the stage.

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The laughs came relatively easily. Here was a woman, in the image of a
girl, naively and casually relaying a series of horrific and tragic events from
my life, without any element of emotion for the person who had fallen
victim to them because Carol had no self. The situation spelled out my
reality cruelly and blatantly. I was unable to feel for most of the things
which had happened to me and of which I had been seen to be a part. The
audience was, for a change, as alienated at I was.


They could not believe that what I was saying, and how I was saying it,
was anything other than a joke, yet every bit of it was closely aligned to the
reality of the events which had truly surrounded me. I was trying to show
them the hypocrisy of life without feeling whilst at the same time I was
confirming my own lack of hope that, even pushed to the limits, I might
discover some feeling for my life which I had not felt before.


Quite simply, it came down to the fact that I had never experienced ‘the
world’ with the walls down. The distinction between Carol standing alone
on the stage and the collective, social and communal atmosphere of the
laughing audience, down there, summed it up in all its poetic tragedy: ‘my
world’ versus ‘theirs’.


I had not done too badly. One of the acts had his own venue and asked
if I'd like to do a paid spot as a support act. I had managed to fall into my
first paid comedy performance.


The reality of it all became a slap in the face. The whole effort had been
an act of self-expression. A scream at the hypocrisy of my situation. The
idea of doing comedy as a skill for which I was to be paid simply
cheapened it all the more. I phoned up the manager of the show and
impersonally left a message on his answering machine telling him on the
spur of the moment that I had gone to Europe.


There was absolutely no reason to go to Europe except that I hadn't yet
been there. My job as a temporary secretary had just ended, and with
no familiar surroundings I couldn't imagine being any more lost than I already
was. Before leaving for Europe, I decided, out of the blue, to go and
be by the ocean. I ran out of my room, grabbing only my toothbrush, and
made my way to the station.


I had always been plagued by a terrifying repetitive dream of the ocean.
Without realizing its significance, something quite subconscious was
driving me to confront this symbolic representation of my dilemma.

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘Where's a good place to go where there is ocean?’ I demanded from the
girl behind the counter.


‘You want me to chose?’ she asked, surprised.


‘Yes, pick a place,’ I ordered.


She picked a place in South Wales and I paid for the ticket.


‘Where are you going to?’ asked a pleasant old lady sitting next to me
on the platform.


‘Don't know. Can't pronounce it. It's Welsh,’ I explained.


I was disturbed at not being able to pronounce it and turned to the
stranger sitting beside me, at the top end of the platform. The stranger
pronounced it, and I tried to memorize it. The train came along, and we all
got in. I liked to sit near to the door. The stranger had by chance decided to
sit by the door, too. He sat opposite me, and we both looked out of the
window.


There was something about this man's manner. He was making me
terribly nervous by his obvious shyness and embarrassment at sitting
opposite me. I could relate to his behaviour too well. I had recognized it as
my own language and began to feel nervous and exposed at someone else
being privy to it.


The Welsh stranger made a series of statements, in a manner addressed
more to himself than to me. I was alarmed yet intrigued, embarrassed by
how exposing and vulnerable it felt to be communicated with in my own
manner. Not since my friendship with Bryn so many years before had I
found someone who spoke the evasive language of indirectness so well.


The train journey took three hours. Both of us sat there, nervous,
exposed and embarrassed. Though intrigued, we both sat poised to run at
the first opportunity. To have done so of our own volition, however, would
have been too exposing in that it would have indicated choice. To one who
spoke the language, this would have demonstrated the frightening nature
and realness of the contact we had made. We sat there, swapping trivia,
talking via objects and events, and losing our self-awareness in the evasive
jargon and complexity of the poetry-like speech which so often got our
listeners lost.


Surprisingly we had understood each other. There was a sensing of our
similarity in our shared differentness. We were both curious.


The train journey had taken almost three hours. The Welshman was to
get off one stop before my destination. He couldn't ask, and I knew how
that felt.


‘You can get off here if you want,’ he stated. I admired him, for saying
that he had had more courage than I would have been able to find. I sat

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He stood at the doorway looking at me. His eyes and smile, forced in
their casualness, defied the stifled expression of a want that he was too
trapped to express. ‘You can still get off here,’ he stated, unable to ask.
Though afraid, I made a last-minute decision and jumped off the train as it
ground to a halt.


‘You're crazy,’ he had said, his excitement calling for a need to create
distance. He had hit upon a sore point by saying that.


‘Thanks,’ I said bluntly.


‘It's great, though,’ he added in a hurried awkwardness.


We were both shaking, surprised at our own gameness.


We went to a café. He sat across the table. His foot touched mine
accidently, and I was painfully aware of it. Yet, at the same time as it was
frightening, I was too afraid to move away as this would have shown that it
mattered. I let my expression ignore it. I trembled; my feelings were
screaming to run for my life.


He offered to pay for what I'd eaten. I insisted on paying. It brought me
out of any obligation and got around the problem of being unable to
accept generosity. It didn't work. He worked by the same system. He
insisted that he then had to buy me a drink later on that night. A time and a
place were arranged.


I found myself a room in a bed-and-breakfast and, terrified, went to my
room, glad to be alone. I contemplated escaping, not because I felt nothing
for this man but because I sensed that he knew my way of functioning too
well. He could get close to me. Nevertheless, when I had agreed to
something, I had always to stick to it. I went to the hotel to meet him.


I was petrified. I bought myself two glasses of wine in order to calm
down. I hated the fact that there were people around me. Other people had
no part in this. What I felt was simply too personal to allow other people
even to glance upon me being there. Hopeful, I asked whether the hotel
had a piano.

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The piano sat alone in a huge and glorious dining-room. I sat at the
piano, hoping I would first hear the stranger coming, and began hesitantly
to play.


The stranger entered the dining-room. Acutely aware of how personal
my playing was to me, I tried convincingly to say that I was no longer
interested in playing.


‘Go on,’ he said. Obediently I began to play, losing my place and
playing stiltedly as I lost the ability through concentrating too hard. The
stranger was moved by my music. We were both shaking and nervous at
feeling so real. I suggested we leave.


The freedom of walking made it safer to talk. Walking was, after all,
one stop off running. It was that open door I always needed to feel safe.


We walked for hours in the darkness. We walked to the ocean, and in
my mind I sang a song to the sea. I looked desperately at the stranger and
wished that, for once, I had the courage to share this with another person.
Even thinking this was terrifying. Walking back up the shore, I found the
courage to sing out loud, to myself, unable to let even my own mind know
that what I was singing was a means of communication.


This stranger understood my language. He spoke it himself. He never
invaded. He never complimented. He never made it obvious that he was
sharing. He simply stayed within my company, ‘being’.


I felt so ‘found’, I could have cried. As always, the tears could never
make it to my eyes. I laughed, and my fear hid behind a casual façade.


We went walking in the darkness towards the rolling hills. We climbed
on someone's farm equipment -- two three-year-olds in a playground all
their own. He reached out to give me a hand to climb up. My heart sank. I
became painfully aware of my inability to combine touch and feeling.


We'd turned back towards the town. Walking alongside him, I felt: a
strange sensation. The hair stood up on the back of my arms, and we stared
at each other in shock.


Like the little girl in the theatrical shop a year before, he reached out
hesitantly and touched the back of my arm.


‘Are you real?’ he asked.


Stunned, I managed to say, ‘Yes.’


‘It felt like you just walked through me,’ he said.


‘I know,’ I said, my mind lost in some strange hypnotic stare. ‘I felt it,
too.’


It was as though the wind had blown straight through me. My eyes
scanned my hands and feet, surprised that I did, in fact, have a physical
body.

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had always experienced being touched emotionally as the threat of
death. The tremors associated with this were equivalent to having been in
a near-death situation where the only thing your mind is saying is ‘Get me
out of here; I'm going to die’. I had finally confronted this fear of death
which washed over me like ocean waves. I had heard the roaring sound of
silence in my ears and lost all sense of self-awareness as I stayed with the
death-like fear emotion gave me. I had found myself in a state of shock
through allowing myself to keep a grip on feeling. Yet I had survived. No
characters emerged automatically to take over. Donna was beginning to
win the battle. This time, however, she was not fighting to mirror someone
else. She was fighting to come out to someone who was <i>her</i> mirror.


We sat talking more to ourselves than to each other, allowing the other
to listen in, until the sun began to come up. I felt I had known this man my
entire life.


All words were irrelevant. I sensed this stranger's familiarity as though
it were myself sitting next to me. I had failed to respond to the fear which
seemed to feed on my closeness like a vulture. In failing, I had won.


We stood silently watching the waves crashing. It was noon the next
day, and my train was due in an hour. I'd come further in the one day I'd
known this stranger than I had in years of meeting those who had no hope
of reflecting me enough to reach me as only I could reach myself. There
was no hug goodbye. Not even a handshake. Even to look at each other
was overwhelming and exposing. Yet, knowing my fear, knowing his, and
knowing the need to try to learn to ignore it, we made an unbreakable
promise to stay in touch, then I turned without saying goodbye and ran the
length of the street, around the corner and to the station for the train to
take me back to my things in London.


A letter arrived. The stranger's words echoed my own feelings and experiences.
I couldn't believe they were real and that he was every bit
the reflection of me I'd perceived him to be. I had to see him once again before
I disappeared to Europe.


I arrived unexpectedly at the address he had given me. His family were
warm and welcoming and didn't seem the least bit alarmed by the surprise
of my visit.


He was in his room. I entered and stood in the doorway. I was shaking
like a leaf, and so was he. Wanting a way out, wanting to be made to run, so

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Everything was the same as before. Nothing had changed. My intense
fear was making me talk at a hundred miles an hour. Surprisingly he kissed
me for the first time. I broke into tears. He had asked what I was crying
about, and I had covered my tracks. Yet I had been crying because it was
the first time in my life I had really ‘been there’ whilst I had been kissed.


His parents were ecstatic. They'd never seen their son talk so much or
be so sociable with a friend. During the day we watched TV, played music
and hardly emerged from the insular security of his room. During the
night we went walking through the darkness of the Welsh countryside so
representative of our own darkness, so rarely lit by the presence of another
person who walked within ‘Our world’ and ‘the world’ at the same time.


After two days we caught the train together which would see us go our
separate ways. He had to go away for three months. I had already decided a
week ago to go to Europe.


I firmly nailed down the lid of my tea-chest of belongings and left
wondering if I'd return with enough courage to see the Welsh stranger
again.


I was afraid of being cornered by people I might meet, talking rings
around me and manipulating me into situations I couldn't get out of.


I was wide-eyed and felt terribly vulnerable as I faced the prospect of
travelling alone throughout Europe. The stranger had offered me the
opportunity to stay with his parents until he returned. Frightened, I had
desperately wanted to hide in his room full of security. Yet the inability to
reach out or accept anything still crippled me, making his offer impossible
to accept.


I had always wanted to see Holland and imagined myself skating alone
on fields of endless white ice. But I'd missed the ferry to Holland, and
the next one was going to Belgium. I didn't even know there was a country
called Belgium, but at the risk of sleeping at the ferry terminal I caught the
last ferry to Belgium arriving before midnight.

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The stranger had given me an empty bottle which he had filled with
invisible hugs, just in case, in the privacy of my solitude, I might like to
give them to myself. The vulnerability of remaining feeling whilst
surrounded by the world of strangers into which I had thrown myself was
too much of a threat. I got a room at 11.55 p.m. Alone in my hostel room
on my first night abroad in greater Europe, I opened the bottle and
allowed myself to feel the security I had felt when he had locked ourselves
in his room. I put my arms around myself and rocked as tears ran silently
down my face. I screamed deafeningly within my mind. The bottle of hugs
seemed to mock my inadequency. I wanted no-one to see it. I hid it in the
darkness of a corner in the back of an obscure cupboard. That empty bottle
stood for myself. I would travel alone without any emotions to haunt me.


I awoke and went out into the misty morning along the cobblestone
streets of Ostend. Ducks on chilly ponds, a horse and cart, shop windows
filled with handmade lace butterflies and old-fashioned collars. I
walked across a narrow town bridge and laughed at how the buildings
along the canal reached right down into the water. Where on earth were
the buildings' legs? I thought. What is the way of life here, what language
do these people speak, and what country is Belgium next to?


I went to what appeared to be a small shop and looked for the door.
There was only a window and a lot of very unusual-looking food. I was
addressed in a language I couldn't understand, and it struck me that I
couldn't even ask this shopkeeper where the door was so that I could go in
and buy something. Then it dawned on me that, for some strange reason,
these shops in this strange place had no doors for the customers to go in.
One was supposed to order from the window. I looked at the food and
wondered what the hell was in it, and whether, with my allergies, it would
make me sick. I reckoned that not eating was just as likely to make me sick,
so in response to the shopkeeper's garble I pointed at something and
offered him a handful of change I'd got at the ferry terminal.


Not knowing where to go, I walked towards the station. Trains take
people places. Travel was a universal language. One didn't need to speak;
one had only to go. I would go to find the ice in Holland.


I listened to the voices around me and caught the train to the name of a
place that sounded familiar: Amsterdam.

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I arrived in Amsterdam as it was getting dark. Scruffy people kept
shoving pamphlets into my hands about hostels to stay in. I stopped and
brought a hotdog at a stall, and a photographer approached me and began
to take photos. I glared at him from beneath my black hat. In my
high-collared black coat, black hat and rucksack, I looked like a Quaker. I
hadn't understood the photographer's interest till he turned his camera on
some nearby children. What was it he saw? Perhaps innocence.


I was pointed in the direction of a Christian hostel and given some
good advice on where not to stay and walk about alone at night in
Amsterdam.


At the door of my hostel room I froze at the realization that I would be
in a room with about twenty other women.


The next day I went out to look for a job. For some reason it never
occurred to me that the rules for any country would be any different from
those in England. It was simple, I thought. I'd get some temporary work as
a secretary or a cleaner. I was very wrong. I arrived back at the hostel
feeling depressed and disillusioned. There was no work for an Australian
in Amsterdam -- at least, not what I considered work. I had only enough to
pay for my dinner. It was time to find a cash machine and get some money.
Was I in for a shock!


I asked where I could use my card, and my heart sank and I felt sick at
the reply. There was nowhere in the Netherlands, let alone in Amsterdam.
The nearest branch for my account was in Paris. Even with a visa it would
have cost me more than I had to get there. I used the last of my money to
call my bank in England, and somewhere between tears, swearing and
mutual misunderstanding my money ran out on the phone call and left me
totally penniless in a foreign country.


I went back to the hostel hysterical. The staff managed to calm me
down and said they'd help. My room would be free, and I could work in
the kitchen in exchange for meals until my money came through from
England. They gave me the money to call again. This time I got through.


I was told that protocol was protocol and I would have to send them
signed permission to transfer funds to Amsterdam. It would take several
days, and there was a limit to the amount I could receive.


In the mean time a room-mate from the hostel asked if I'd go
sightseeing around the city with her. After all, it might cheer me up. We
were hungry, and I was sick of people supporting me. I took off my hat,
laid it on the footpath in the main street and began to sing. The money fell
like rain from heaven. It wasn't much, but it was enough to buy some bread
and a cup of tea.

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A slick, fairly streetwise type approached us and gave us some advice.
He picked up my hat and shoved it into my friend's hands. ‘This is how you
do it,’ he said, and instructed her to walk directly up to the passers-by with
my hat as I sang. He had been busking for about three years and was only
too willing to tell us how to be successful. I sang a bit more, and then we all
went for coffee.


Before my money arrived from England I had sung for a few hours
every day and learned the best busking-places around Amsterdam's city
square. I had bought my room-mate and myself bread and tea every day,
had paid for my hostel room and even bought something I'd always
wanted: a tambourine.


My money came through, and my room-mate had a wonderful idea of
what to do with it. She asked me to go to Germany with her. We boarded
the train for Berlin where she knew some friend of a friend of a friend.


This woman was surprised to meet her, and even more surprised to meet
me, but she was a medical student and a really nice person and glad to have
the two of us suddenly drop in on her. My travelling companion was keen
to show off the singing and tambourine-playing talents of her weird
friend, and I was glad to latch on to her apparent sense of destination.
Together we made our way around Berlin as I sang and bought them bread
and tea. At the Berlin wall I got some sense of perspective. I had heard of it
on the news and was glad to be with something familiar. We went into East
Berlin at the time when the wall was still protected by armed guards as
those from the West chipped away at it with hired-out hammers and sold
pieces of graffiti-covered stone from it.


One night, when the others went out and I sat alone in the German
woman's flat, listening to Chris de Burgh singing ‘Borderline’, my
room-mate from Amsterdam met two German travellers going towards
Austria. She returned and told me the news. By now I was almost broke
again, and it was a relief to know we had a cheap means of transport.
Together we met the woman the next day and headed south. At Freiburg
my old room-mate decided to travel with one of the women to her home in
the Black Forest. The other woman was going to a fairy-tale village in the
province of Hessen. The sound of a castle overlooking a town full of
twisting cobblestoned streets seemed like something I'd dreamed up
rather than reality.

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I fell in love with the place instantly. All the streets were narrow and
cobblestoned, little staircases cropping up to take you down to the next
street below. There were hills which seemed to roll on for ever, and I could
see open space for miles. I let my mind fly over them.


I had not been able to find a place to stay. I started to hitchhike and was
picked up by a young German man. I spoke no German and, thinking he
spoke no English, felt fairly safe. As it turned out, his English was fine. He
was a residential worker in a children's home and was on his way to stay
there for the next two nights. He offered me a room at the children's home.
I was momentarily stunned at destiny having presented me with the
opportunity to stay in that horror of all horrors, a children's home.
Nevertheless, having nowhere else to go, I accepted.


Julian was an intense though gentle person. Like me, he wrote poetry
and music within which, like me, he was most truly himself.


As always, the children took to me wonderfully. They led me about
telling me the names of things in German, which, to their delight, I would
repeat, listening to the sound.


Julian had been watching me secretly as I watched the children. He had
begun to study me. ‘Stop looking at me,’ I snarled, as I so often did when
people tried to study me. Julian smiled knowingly. He seemed no stranger
to my behaviour, perhaps having seen it in another child somewhere. He
said nothing and went on observing, at times when I least expected.


He played music and asked me to sing, never waiting for a response as
to whether I would or not. He had used the right tactics, as he continued to
play, seeming really not to care as to whether I joined in or not. I began to
sing. ‘That's great,’ he said, his head still bowed as he played guitar. He had
invited his friend over to hear me sing.


As though now more self-assured with his friend there, he had all of a
sudden looked straight into my eyes. My heart sank with fear as I sat there,
abandoned by my characters.


As though my frightened look had confirmed his own preconceptions,
he reached forward and brushed my cheek with the back of his hand, as
though taming a delicate and frightened little bird. I glared at him in terror
and moved away. He was tiptoeing through a minefield and was taking
everything a step at a time. I was an easy victim. Fortunately, he had no
intention of treating me like one.


Julian was intrigued by why I was so totally different at different times,
though, unlike most people, he was perceptive enough to notice that these
changes were fear responses rather than true expressions of my personality.
After spending several days with me and only being able to get close to

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was shocked at his perceptiveness.


‘What would you know?’ I replied.


‘It's just that I've never seen anyone with so much energy to keep up a
performance for so long. Where does all of the energy come from?’ he
asked, assuming the correctness of his observation.


‘How do you know it's not really me?’ I asked.


‘I'm a performer, too,’ said Julian, ‘but you... you've got too much
energy. You know, sometimes it's frightening.’


Julian was looking deeply into my eyes. I kept looking away. Yet, with
each challenging remark, I would glare at him and he would capture me
again.


I had finally held Julian's stare and tried not to run away.


‘There's somebody there,’ I said, referring to the person I had seen in
his eyes. ‘Am I here?’ I had asked genuinely.


‘Yes, you're there,’ said Julian reassuringly.


He touched my hair. I pulled away.


‘<i>It</i> burns me,’ I explained. ‘All touch is pain.’


‘I don't want to hurt you,’ he said gently.


Julian had asked me about my experiences in early childhood. I had
tried to tell him, but couldn't tell him the secrets which held together the
walls which were both my prison and my protection. I tried instead to
explain things to him in evasive and symbolic terms and then gave up and
hid behind the relaying of the tragic early childhood events for which I
had felt nothing. Unintentionally I was leading him in the wrong direction
for the answers he sought.


Julian fell victim to my own hopelessness, seeing that I was unable to
climb out of the pit he sensed me in and not knowing how to get the answers
which might help me out. His frustration and his caring disturbed
me.


I disappeared to a city two hours away. After two days I returned and
phoned Julian.


‘Where are you?’ he demanded.


‘I'm here, just down the road from you,’ I said, and gave him the details
of where I'd been and how I'd now landed a position teaching English in

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I took time out to lock myself in my new-found attic room, alone. I
began again to have night terrors, waking up yet being unable to call the
room back into the image of its true reality. I watched the events around me
as though in a picture-theatre watching a 3D movie. I was terrified. The
fear, stuck in my throat, escaped in nothing more than a series of stifled
whimpering screams. Nobody else heard.


In this dream, my little brother had been tying up seven small kittens.
He was tying their legs together so they could not run and then tying their
necks to their legs so that they could not breathe or move for fear of
cutting their own throats. I tried to reach out to stop him as he laughingly
threw the first of the kittens over a high brick wall where I could not get it.
I felt myself pulled from behind. My mothers was pulling me backwards
by the hair. I fought desperately to save the kittens, but to no avail as my
head came thumping down upon the wall.


Whenever I had become Carol, my true self had always been
symbolized by a kitten. This was my sense of self when the real Carol had
taken me home to her house like some stray kitten she had found in the
park. I had once found a bag of seven kittens dumped by the side of a creek
and brought them all home where I hid them in the garage, just as I had
slept in people's garages later. Each kitten was in my mind to stand for a
colour of the rainbow, and each colour of the rainbow was to stand for the
different types of feeling people had, which were so evasive within myself.


My feelings for my little brother were the first I had ever had for
someone I recognized as a separate person. In the dream, Tom's action of
tying up the kittens and throwing them over the wall out of my reach was
an expression of how my fear of feeling had caused me to tie myself up.
Throughout my life, I had thrown this helpless self out, beyond the wall,
into ‘the world’, under the disguise of Carol.


Willie was the protector of this self and went to save the helpless
kittens. Willie's fighting ability, however, was stopped before it could save
them by my mother's actions which had left the kittens to be thrown out
into ‘the world’ whether they were prepared for it or not.


I was furious at Julian making me feel. I had decided that feeling things
was quite dangerous in too large a dose and spent more and more time on
my own.


It was too late to undo the ability to feel, and I now found it harder and
harder to hold on to the characters of Carol and Willie. Since being on a
special diet to avoid food and chemical sensitivities and to maintain a

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The feelings brought to the surface by the stranger in Wales were not
going to lie down and die. It was too late to turn the clocks back, and Julian
continued to stoke the fire.


In a second dream I saw my grandfather.


Since before my grandfather had died, I had had a repetitive dream. I
was walking alone through a bareness, surrounded by hills. Suddenly I
heard a roaring sound, and huge ocean waves came gushing fearsomely
over the hills from all around me, covering me instantly without warning. I
held on desperately to a pole which had been in the middle of the barren
land where I had been standing. I closed my eyes tight. I could not breathe.
I could not scream. I felt the crushing feeling and immensity of the ocean
which had swallowed me up. In the tide going out, the ocean gushed back
over the hills as instantly as it had come. I clung terrified to the pole, too
afraid to move. I think that's how my real self experienced emotion for
most of my life.


In this second dream I was surrounded by a high wall. My grandfather
was leaving through a hole in the wall, and I reached out to try to stop him
leaving. I waited until he had left, then went after him.


After I climbed through the hole, I found myself again, as before, in a
barren land. I called out. My voice was hollow and sounded like an echo.
Nobody came.


I ran back through the hole in the wall, and my mother grabbed hold of
me. I knew that she was going to try to make me stay on this side of the
wall. I searched frantically for my way back to the bareness, but I could not
find the way in and I was trapped.


I woke up unable to shake off the incredible feeling of vulnerability I
felt, and no longer felt so secure being alone. Whether I liked it or not, at
the age of twenty-six I was being made to stay in ‘the world’.

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt more afraid indoors than I did outdoors, especially at night since
the nightmares. I began to go walking through the snow and the leaves,
up in the hills at night.


Up in the forest, in the snow, it was not as dark as one might think. The
snow reflected a whiteness all around, and the atmosphere was more like
early dawn when I used to go and visit my grandfather than it was like
night.


I laid in the snow in my raincoat. My feet were soaking wet where the
snow had got in through the holes in the soles of my boots. In a quiet little
voice I sang to myself in my bed in the snow and wished I had the courage
to ask Julian to come and sit with me to protect me. I thought of the
stranger from Wales and wondered how I'd ever go back to see him again
after the huge journey I had made through my own soul. I sang some of
the songs I had written and bathed in my own sense of security.


It was time to say goodbye to Julian. Out of the blue I phoned up late at
night to say I was going first thing in the morning.


‘Stay right there. I'll pick you up,’ he said.


I arrived at the children's home where I had stayed almost two months
before. Insecure, I kept my coat on and my bag by my side. I had a door. It
was safe to try to let myself be there.


Julian touched my hand. I linked my fingers through his as though this
was my grandmother's crocheted cardigan. He tried to look into my eyes.
We were both there. The rest of the people in the room seemed to
disappear. Our feet were touching. I was again painfully aware of the
closeness but kept reassuring myself that it was safe.


This self-assurance was something new. Willie had gone from being a
prison warder to a psychiatrist to a genuine mother who spoke my own
language. I finally felt at home within myself within ‘the world’.


‘I've gotta go,’ I said.


‘I'll walk you to the door,’ said Julian.


For the first time, I reached out to hug <i>him</i>. I stayed with the feeling,
telling myself reassuringly: ‘It's OK, it's OK, I promise we can go if it hurts
too much.’


Julian lifted my chin and looked into the eyes of my peacefully smiling
face.


‘I'm here. Are you there?’ I said.


Julian smiled.


My fear had got the better of me. I hurriedly and bluntly said ‘Bye’ and
turned, walking away, my gaze fixed on the ground as I walked away from
the house.

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘It's OK,’ I said to myself. ‘See, I said we could go if it hurt too much.’


I turned and walked back over to Julian. I raised my head and looked
sadly into his eyes the way I had looked at my grandfather when I had felt
his realness slipping away from me. Julian didn't slip away. Tears rolled
down my face, and I smiled peacefully, so proud that I had found the
strength and trust to let him see my feelings and to let them come out.


‘I'll miss you,’ I said, sniffling.


‘Just come back one more time,’ said Julian.


‘Perhaps,’ I replied.


‘Just come back one more time,’ Julian repeated.


I hugged him once more and walked hurriedly across the lawn to the
waiting car.


My rucksack on my back, dressed in my black coat and hat, I stood at
the corner to the motorway hitching a lift to the station which
would take me out of Germany. I boarded the train as I had originally
boarded the ferry -- alone -- and said goodbye to Germany as the train
crossed into Belgium.


The train stopped across the road from the ferry which would take me
back to the UK. I needed to run. I needed distance. Julian was far away
now, but the me I'd found and been able to hold on to had danced in the
light long enough to know that <i>this</i> was the way out.


There was nowhere in particular to go, but the ocean seemed like the
place to be. I'd face my emotions symbolically and realistically and bring
the two realms of awareness together at some point. I headed for Wales.


I arrived at the home of the Welshman. He'd returned to the UK after
three months away, and I went with his father to pick him up.


It was a very long drive, and his father did most of the talking.


‘My son's a bit strange, you know, Donna,’ he said.


‘No, he's not,’ I replied.


‘Please don't tell him or his mother I told you,’ he went on, ‘but he's a
funny sort of retarded, you see.’

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I smiled inwardly to myself, remembering how the Welshman had told
me all of this himself, yet his parents thought he didn't understand. I
remembered how he'd told me that his father had helped him get into the
job he was in and the problems he had with friendships, emotions and
words.


‘He had meningitis as a baby and it affected him,’ the father explained.
‘Sometimes he does funny things.’


‘There's nothing wrong with him,’ I put in. ‘He's just like me.’


The Welshman's name was Shaun, and Shaun was quite clearly drunk.
Climbing into the front seat of the car, he hardly looked at me. He had
known I was coming, and the quick but silent glances he shot across the
car spoke louder than words.


We were stuck in traffic on the motorway, and Shaun got out of the car
without warning. He was oblivious to his father's shouts and made his way
to the side of the motorway and took a leak.


The father turned to me and said sorry, and it occurred to me that he
thought I must have been embarrassed by his son's behaviour.


‘What for?’ I asked, for it hardly seemed odd to take a pee when a
person needed one.


‘He's a bit weird sometimes, our Shaun,’ he said, hoping to make up for
the embarrassment which was his and not mine.


Shaun climbed back into the car as it continued to move along the
motorway but this time he climbed into the back. He sat there unable to
look me in the eye, and instead of feeling threatened by my having
understood him I now felt the need to say I had. Silently I said it in a look,
and for that moment Donna had spoken, albeit silently, in ‘the world’. We
touched hands, and I felt chilled and thought how lucky he was to be
drunk at that moment. We still didn't look at each other.


Back at his parents' house, Shaun went straight out. He returned hours
later drunker than he had left, having hitched a lift back from the next
town. I had been staring straight at the ceiling and sat bolt upright as

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Shaun's face stared silently back at me, and in his eyes I saw the same
look I'd given my grandparents many years ago. It was a look which spoke
of being a thousand miles away with no way back.


Shaun went to go again, and I told him to wait and take me to the
station. He had brought some gifts back from his trip away, as had I.
Without saying anything, he had placed a stuffed leather camel by my bag.
I looked at it and thought how this creature drifts through the desert with
no particular place to go or be. I moved it away and, picking up my bag,
turned my back on it to go.


‘Sorry he's like this,’ said his parents, who seemed angry at their son's
distant behaviour. The fact that he was like this had clouded these same
characteristics in myself.


‘It's OK,’ I said, ‘I understand.’


They continued, and I saw echoes of my own mother's shame and
excuses. The words, ‘Don't worry about her; she's crazy’ rang in my ears,
and I spat out the words; ‘I understand why he's like this. It's not him. It's
not me. It's both of us. We're both like this,’ I said. I didn't have a word for
this big word <i>this</i>, but I knew it felt like death.


Silently Shaun drove like a maniac to the station, his eyes riveted on
nothing in particular. He was rigid and trembled violently. He hit the
brakes, and his eyes were desperate as he reached for my door and pushed
it open. His shaking hands gripped my arm as I went to run from the car
and he grabbed a piece of scrap paper and pencil.


He was shaking so much he couldn't write. The pencil tore through the
paper, and the battle he was having with himself showed in his eyes, which
were filling with tears of frustration.


He finished making scratches in what was left of the paper and forced it
roughly into my hand and closed my fist around it.


‘Go. Go before something happens,’ he said, and shoved me before
slamming the door and speeding away.


I stood on the platform shaking, afraid to look at the note. It crossed my
mind to throw it away. It was all too much. It was all too familiar. It was all
too me.

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The train was going to nowhere in particular as far as I knew. All that
mattered to me was that I was going away from here. The colours were
too much. The lights were too much. The people and their sounds were
too much. I curled up in a corner and turned to the wall and let it all die
away, the note screwed up in my hand.


I got to the end of the line and realized I had no ticket. I crossed the
platform, jumped on to the tracks and walked along in the darkness beside
a tall wire fence. ‘What are you doing?’ I heard myself say. I answered by
scrambling up the embankment with the intention of finding out where I
was and where I was going to.


I stopped at a bus stop, happy to be alone in a quiet place; a nobody
nowhere. I realized I was still holding the note.


Under the street light, I unravelled the crumpled paper. The words
upon the page defied the roughness of the writing. ‘You were the best
friend I had waited my whole life for. Stay in touch,’ it read. There was a
Shaun in that note. There was a Donna in that note. And, little did I know,
there was a word to describe why, which would tell me there were many
more like me out there who may or may never make it down the path we
both had found. Ours was a path with black holes everywhere you
stepped. Into each one you could fall down and down for what always
seemed like a deathlike forever. This was a path where we walked alone
and smiled our well-trained smiles as the world passed by and we looked
out from what felt like a world under glass.


I got back in touch with Shaun. He found it very hard to talk. He phoned
me back four times, stuttering, breaking off in mid-sentence and ‘talking
in poetry’. On the fifth call he told me how much trouble he'd had
since he'd met me. His boss had become very concerned that he was crazy.
He'd isolated himself more than usual and lived in his thoughts.


‘I've got a problem,’ he said to me on the phone between lengthy
pauses. ‘I'm in love with you,’ he finally managed as the line went silent on
both ends. ‘The problem is,’ he finally went on, ‘I feel it's going to kill me.’

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘I know,’ I replied.


That was the last Shaun had managed to communicate. I never saw or
heard from him again. For some time, neither had his parents. He simply
disappeared as I so often had. Perhaps he went to the ocean.


I found a flat in London and a job as a secretary. It was just what I needed:
the flat on the top floor all to myself, the job with an office just for me. I
was working in an administration section of a major hospital for an impossible
boss who was like something out of a cartoon. During lunch-times, I
would look at birds and squirrels in the hospital grounds, tear leaves apart
and go to the local library.


At home I had brought a cheap plastic typewriter and began to type. I
began with the centre of my world as far back as I could remember. The
nights got longer as one page rolled into the next and I relived each
moment, stared straight ahead and let the words come from my fingers.


I was searching inside myself for a word for what I had shared in
common with the Welshman. As the pages mounted up, so did my visits to
the library where I had my head buried in books on schizophrenia and
searched desperately to find a sense of belonging within those pages
which would give me a word to put to all of this.


Suddenly it jumped out at me from the page. It was the first time since
my father had said it four years ago that I'd heard the word. ‘Autism,’ it
read, ‘not to be confused with schizophrenia.’ My heart jumped, and I
shook. Perhaps this was the answer or the beginning of finding one. I
looked for a book on autism.


There upon the pages I felt both angered and found. The echoed
speech, the inability to be touched, the walking on tiptoe, the painfulness
of sounds, the spinning and jumping, the rocking and repetition mocked
my whole life. My head swam with images of the abuse that had been my
training. The necessity to create the characters had torn me apart but saved
me from being a statistic. Part of me had complied with my training, the
other part had made it twenty-six years with a private cut-off world intact.

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wanted an opinion once and for all as to why I was like this. I decided to
take my book to a child psychiatrist who could read it and tell me why.
In my lunch-break I asked for directions to the child psychiatry department
of the hospital. I looked for and found a door with the appropriate label
on it and knocked.


‘I've written a book,’ I said to the professional behind the desk. ‘I want
you to read it and tell me why I'm like I am,’ I told him.


The psychiatrist was taken aback and asked me what the book was
about. I told him how I'd been called crazy, stupid, disturbed and just plain
weird, and that my father had told me people had said I was autistic.


‘Well, the way you've presented me this book seems rather autistic,’ he
commented. He asked why I'd chosen him to read it, and I explained that
I'd simply looked for a door with the right label on it.


It wasn't long before I heard back from this doctor. He was quite taken
by the book and wanted a specialist on autism to read it. He asked me if he
could send it on. It hadn't occurred to me to publish it, and I was scared. He
pointed out that there were many children who had had experiences like
mine and that my book may be important in understanding them. I had
wanted to burn it. I had written it for myself and had wanted just to read it
back and see my life consistently and see that my life had belonged to me. I
also wanted to know why it had all happened because, although I'd found
many answers, I hadn't yet worked out why it had all happened in the
beginning.


The response which came back was overwhelmingly supportive. My
book had, it seemed, portrayed what is typically seen in autistic children,
though I had no doubt done better at overcoming my difficulties than
many ever would. I was encouraged to send the book to a publisher.


At home my mind worked overtime as I slept. The characters were out
of hiding and so was I. My fear of sleep was still strong, and the dreams it
threw me into were almost more than I was ready to see.


I was dreaming. A mouse ran across the bare floorboards of an empty
attic followed by another one. Fighting the awareness of what I knew, my
face remained blank, my expression oblivious. A man went to kill them.


‘No,’ I screamed suddenly, ‘you can't. They're not mice,’ I said finally,
‘they're kittens. Please, can we feed them?’ I asked pleadingly.


He opened the cupboard door, and tins of food fell out on to the floor. I
opened one of the cans and called the kittens. He went to touch one as it
approached.


‘No,’ I shouted, ‘if you touch them, they will die.’

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As they ate, they began to grow. I felt torn about feeding them. What
would happen to them after I was gone and there was no-one else to feed
them again? I thought. It is better never to be fed than be fed and have it
taken away again. The man looked at me crouched down on the floor.


‘I must tell you,’ I said almost in a whisper, ‘there are more of them.
There are seven.’


I woke up in a sweat and paced around the room. The words had been
freed by the book, and now their meaning was, too. I cried and rocked and
told myself it was OK to be.


I went out and got a tin of catfood and sat it on the sidetable next to my
bed. Although I had no real cat, it was to be a symbol that I would commit
myself to feed and care for the kittens which represented myself. It was a
way of showing I meant this commitment in ‘the world’, not just in mine.


Years before, I had found a small kitten in an industrial waste-bin. I had
taken it home, but I didn't know how sick it was or how to care for it
properly and it had died. I was about to be revisited.


I looked at the tin of catfood in the lamplight and eventually drifted off
to sleep. I saw myself as a teenage Carol in a corner chattering away to a
group of friends. A rustling noise came from the large waste-bin nearby.
Carol ignored it, talking faster and faster. There was a sense of urgency that
nobody should take their attention away from her; nobody should notice
the rustling from the bin. After all, it was probably only a rat or something.


A dirty little girl of about four in a torn dress emerged from the bin in a
scurry. Carol turned her back on the group, her body a wall between them
and the little girl. Looking at the little girl, she said silently: ‘You've come
home.’


The little girl had backed into a corner, her eyes darting, poised to run.


‘It's OK,’ said Carol. ‘I promise they won't come near us,’ she said,
referring to the group. ‘I won't even touch you,’ she said to the little girl,
and with that she walked ahead of her away from the group without
looking back. She walked with her hand held backward to the little girl
and didn't stop to see whether she was coming. The little girl ran and took
her hand without looking at her. The little girl's eyes darted back over her
shoulder as they walked away together.

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Donna had gone from being symbolized as a kitten to being recognized
by my own mind as a human being, albeit a child. Carol had finally
come back to the park and taken Donna home to ‘the world’ after all
these years. There was no need for the tin of catfood any more. Donna
would never again be anything other than a human being.


By now Willie had become a mother and an encourager, and Carol had
promised to keep Donna safely away from groups of people. There was
one more battle to overcome. Willie had to accept Carol.


By now I was developing a clear awareness of an ‘I’ and I was becoming
aware that I would have to lose my dependence upon the characters as
something separate to myself. I was, however, not yet ready to turn to
people.


I came across a ragged little toy at a market. It was in a pile of broken
toys with missing bits. It had a ribbon with blue spots on it and looked like
a cross between a sheep, a rabbit and a dog. It was about fifteen to twenty
years old and cost twenty pence. I bought it for myself and named him
Travel Dog. He was to travel everywhere with me every day, just as the
characters had. He was to become my bridge to living things beyond the
wall of my own body.


I needed Travel Dog, but having him physically next to me hurt me emotionally.
It was a new experience, and I was unfamiliar with accepting
the boundaries of my own body in relation to the world outside it. I hadn't
been so aware of what this uncomfortable feeling was until I had become
consistently attached to something which represented the feeling world
outside me. I cried a lot and began to try to hug myself rather than lose
awareness or attack myself with frustration.


Sleeping had become a bit easier with Travel Dog to keep guard over
the darkness. But Travel Dog couldn't keep the dreams away, and the final
battle was about to be fought.

With Travel Dog propped by my pillow, I fell asleep. Willie walked
across the floor of an empty warehouse to where Carol stood next
to someone.


‘This is my client,’ said the teenage Carol, referring to the man who
towered over her. The glib comment referred directly to the sense of
domestic prostitution which Carol had been forced to live.


‘You don't have to live like this,’ said Willie.


‘Oh yeah,’ said Carol mockingly. ‘Where else would I live?’ she went
on.


Carol was stuck on time, and not a nice time at that. It was time to show
her that things had changed and there was now somewhere to go.


‘You can come and live with me,’ said Willie as the male stranger stood
there looking arrogant.


‘How would I pay? I don't have any money,’ said Carol.


‘You can do the dishes,’ said Willie.


‘I can take care of myself,’ gloated Carol.


‘I know you can,’ Willie replied. ‘Just come over and see if you want to
stay. If you don't, you can go. The door will be open.’ Willie walked away
without even looking at the stranger next to Carol. Carol looked at the
stranger, then at Willie walking away. Silently, without apology, Carol did
what Carol did best: she followed.


I went to the old tea-chest and took out my lace, my bells and my buttons.
Day in, day out, I sat for hours staring at them and categorizing
them, then mixing them back up again. I was bathing in the freedom to be
me. I had a solid sense of home and belonging within my own body. There
would be no more self-abuse. There would be no more allowing anyone
else to abuse me. Nor would I be pushed beyond what I could handle with
a self intact. Willie would be supportive until I accepted those skills as my
own and applied them to myself. Carol would talk where necessary to
keep down a job until I felt I could accept those skills as my own. I knew I
would one day find friends in ‘the world’ to replace my attachment and dependence

The book was finished and now I had a word for the problems I had
fought to overcome and understand. The label would have been useless
except that it helped me to forgive myself and my family for being the
way I was. Looking back through the photos, I recognized three ways in
which I had avoided looking at people. One was to look straight through
what was in front of me. Another was to look away at something else. The
third was to stare blankly ahead with one eye and turn the other one inwards.
This had the effect of blurring whatever view I had in front of me. I
laid my photos our accordingly and there I saw just how far back my problems
had gone.


There were several photos with this sort of gaze: a gaze which left my
face looking somewhat divided down the middle and the only one which
looked anything like noticing the intrusion of the person taking the
photos. The photos had been taken by different people, spanning a
number of years. What struck me, however, was the age at which the first of
these appeared. It was in a photo where I had been propped up on a chair. I
thought I had been a few months old; certainly no more than four months.
As it turned out, the photo had been taken by my uncle when I was several
weeks old. The look, however, was unmistakable, especially in comparison
with the others like it. One side of my face smiled with the eye turned
inwards. The other side was blank and lost; the eye looking intensely into
nothingness.


I wanted to meet the other autistic people I'd been told about and was
surprised to find out that they were few and far between, scattered
across the country and across the world. I was in an even smaller category I
had become ‘high-functioning’. Nevertheless, I needed to meet others. I

Kath was a solid personality with whom I felt relatively secure. Her
voice was rather flat and even, and the pace with which she spoke was easy
to follow. She had long straight grey hair and darting eyes, and though I
felt welcomed by her I didn't feel smothered by her involvement.


She had a son my age, and her son was autistic. When I met him, he was
running his hands through coloured beads. I didn't want him to say hello
or ask me how I was. Those were words reserved for those who wanted to
move in ‘the world’, and her son Perry certainly didn't.


I sat on the floor nearby and took out a handful of coloured buttons and
glass fruit. I sorted them into groups, put my hand out to where Perry was
playing with his beads and, without a glance and without a word, I
dropped them. Perry caught them and did the same back. I remembered
my first version of relating -- mirrors -- but this time there would be no-one
to say that my version of relating wasn't good enough. This went on for a
while, and we began to modify the game. I had a bell which I jingled to
myself and dropped it for him to catch like before. Like before, Perry
repeated but with the added feature of making a noise to go with it. I
mirrored him and the game became mobile with us following one another
about the place in turn, ringing the bell and giving it over as the game
became more and more direct.


I sat back on the floor, lining up the buttons in categories. Perry
approached, picked up a button here and there and added them to my rows
where they belonged. Without looking at him, I knew what he was saying.
These ‘games’ had always belonged to me. Now I saw that these ‘games’
belonged to autistic people.


I hadn't noticed that Kath had entered the room. She was standing
there silently as Perry came over to where I was, laid himself out, face
down, on the floor in front of me, arms pulled up tightly against his sides as
he shook with anxiety.


‘Look at me,’ I said, reading the same action I'd seen so many times in
myself. ‘Look, I'm daring to be touched.’ I had looked straight at Perry
lying there as I had said it, tears rolling down my face as I read his
behaviour as one might a book. I had the tremors from head to toe and
wished the Welshman was there to understand himself as I had come to
understand myself.


I turned to see Kath crying.

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘I never thought he had any language,’ she said. ‘Now I see he does. I
just don't know how to speak it.’ She said she had never seen him look so
‘normal’. I had never felt I'd understood another individual so well. ‘We
think it is we who have to teach autistic people,’ Kath said. ‘Now I see it is
us who have so much to learn from them.


Kath was also a teacher at a school for autistic children. There was a
camp on, and she asked me if I'd come. I was scared to break the routine
of my usual week. It was one thing to drift without direction when one
was in total control. It was another thing altogether to break with an established
routine to take up an invitation I'd had no part in making even if it
was for just one day. The offer was left open, and I was free to come for as
long as I was able to cope and then to go.


I arrived by train, then bus and then taxi to a setting in the midst of the
countryside of Kent. The children were inside, and I was overwhelmed by
the number of people. Kath said she'd tell them I was coming, but that
didn't stop the usual ‘hello theres’ and I gravitated to Kath and let her talk
for me.


Not all of the children at this school were autistic, particularly at this
gathering, but at the dinner-table one girl in particular stood out as very
familiar.


Anne was eight but the size of a six-year-old, with long blonde hair and
pale white skin like mine. More distinctive was her gaze; one eye staring
blankly ahead, the other turned sharply inwards. She was seated at the
table with her mouth firmly set around the edge of it as she explored its
surface with her tongue. I looked at her and felt somewhat exposed.


Kath wasn't with her, and the other professionals were impatiently
shouting at her in what I felt from her stare must have been an
unintelligible mass of noise threatening to get in. So these were the
professionals, I thought, as I reflected on my mother's own approach.
Looking at Anne, I thought to myself: I know where you are.


Getting Anne to do anything sent her into total hysterics as one might
expect from a child blind and deaf to the world around her and most likely
also to herself. Yet something was missing. She had no form of comforting
herself. I felt compelled to give her a consistent pattern; something to hold
on to and use to calm herself down long enough to open her eyes and take

[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Anne followed me about, and I headed outside for the space of
unfenced-in greenness. Anne was chasing me as I avoided her; busy
dancing upon her shadow She began intermittently to focus on my
shadow, and we chased each other back and forth in turn, both of us with
our eyes upon each other's shadow and feet. I looked up to see a few
teachers looking out at us through the glass of the kitchen window. Who's
under glass now? I thought.


It was night-time, and the children were being put to bed. Naturally this
wasn't an easy task when it comes to children who aren't used to being
still and are not quite aware of what sleep is meant to be for. One autistic
boy jumped up and down in the dark on the top of his bunk. Anne
screamed in terrified hysterics as one of the professionals sat on the bed
beside her tucking a doll in next to her, which seemed to horrify her all the
more. Oh, these symbols of normality, dolls, I thought. Oh, these terrifying
reminders that one is meant to be comforted by people and if one can't
one is meant at least to feel comforted by their effigies.


The woman sitting on Anne's bed was screaming at her over and over
again to shut up and propping the doll back in its place with every shove
Anne made to push it away. It was more than I could take. Physically I
moved the woman out of the way, moved the doll and gave her my brush.
Anne ran her fingers repetitively through the bristles listening to the soft,
barely audible sound in her ear and the sensation in the hand. I began to
hum a repetitive tune I used to do for myself over and over again as I
tapped her arm in time to the hypnotic tune. Give her something
consistent to hold on to, I thought. There'll be all the time in the world for
the experts to undo it.


Anne's crossed eyes were frozen in a dead stare, and she became silent
between sobs. I took her hand and made her tap her own arm as I had, the
tune and the rhythm and the tapping held totally constant.


I heard a soft but audible rhythm coming from outside me. Anne was
making the tune herself in her throat, and I slowly dropped notes of my
humming and, as I expected, she filled them in as though they were and
had been her own. Slowly I dropped out more and more of them until she
was doing not only the rhythm in her throat but carrying the tune as she

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969437-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The sun had come up on a new day, and a trip to the park was scheduled.
Anne's screams came from a small room at the back of the hall. I
walked to the door only to see the same tactics of trying to calm her down
by screaming ‘Shut up’ into her face.


‘I will stay with her,’ I said coldly from the doorway.


‘You're welcome to her,’ came the reply, which seemed to sound as
though she were some sort of unwanted baggage which the woman was
glad to be rid of.


I took out a crystal I had with me and turned it in front of Anne's face.
Anne grabbed for it, and I let her take it. She looked at it in her hand and I
felt I could see glimpses of my grandparents in myself as I related to her
through the object. I sang the old tune over and over, and Anne's hand
went automatically up to her arm and she tapped herself to the rhythm and
eventually joined in. We went out peacefully to the bus.


Someone grabbed suddenly for Anne to pile her on to the bus. In the
confusion of children everywhere and verbal garble Anne again went into
hysterics. Then suddenly her hand went up to her arm and she tapped
herself, humming the tune. The bus started up, and she allowed herself to
be strapped in. As she calmed down, the tapping and humming stopped.
Anne was learning she could control her own anxiety and the level of
overwhelming input. When we got to the park the same thing happened.
She calmed herself down and climbed out of the bus.


I walked ahead across the gate. On tiptoe, Anne half-ran, half-stumbled
as she made her way to where I was. She took my hand, and in unison we
broke into a skip, swinging our hands as we went away from the others,
across the park to the swings.


We both got on the swings. As we swung higher and higher, I
remembered another park a long time ago and wondered if one day there
would be a little autistic girl who would remember a person called Donna
in ‘the world’ whose hand she had taken to skip across the park.
