BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: Hi Lucy.
LUCY: Hello.
COUNSELOR: Is it just me and you so far?
LUCY: Yep.
COUNSELOR: Okay. I got a phone call from Sylvia a few minutes ago, and she had to run to the post office with some kind of an important mailing. So she said she's going to be a little bit late.
LUCY: Okay.
COUNSELOR: And let me see if there's anybody else. Phyllis is out of town.
LUCY: Oh, okay.
COUNSELOR: I did talk to Susan earlier, and she thinks her schedule's going to allow her - I think she had a meeting earlier, but she's thinking that she can get out of the meeting and make it to group. And everybody else I expect.
LUCY: Okay.
JULIE: Hi, it's Julie.
COUNSELOR: Hey, Julie.
LUCY: Hi, Julie.
JULIE: Hi. 
COUNSELOR: It's you and me and Lucy.
JULIE: Okay.
COUNSELOR: I was just saying that Phyllis is out of town, and Sylvia said she's going to be running late.
JULIE: Okay.
COUNSELOR: But I printed out Sylvia's homework and Julie yours as well as Holly's. 
JULIE: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Lucy, did you also do some and I just didn't get it printed out?
LUCY: I did.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Do you know how long ago? Did you do it like -
LUCY: I did it right before I talked to you on Monday.
COUNSELOR: Okay. All right then, let me see if I can find it and print it out. I thought you did.
 
JULIE: I think Lucy was the first one that - that I got.
COUNSELOR: Okay, all right. Well while we're waiting, I'll see if I can't find that.
LUCY: How you doing Julie?
JULIE: Oh, it's - good. 
LUCY: How's your head?
JULIE: My head is good. (Laughs.) 
But we had a snowstorm and then it kind of rained, and I'm sure you know the snow absorbed all the rain and then it froze overnight. So it's just like I feel like I'm in glacier park. (Laughter.) 
LUCY: Oh God.
JULIE: We went out to shovel, and it was just like - it just was not happening (Laughter.) 
HOLLY: Hey it's Holly.
JULIE: Hey, Holly.
COUNSELOR: Hi, Holly.
HOLLY: Lucy, Julie, and Josephine?
JULIE: Yep they're all - 
HOLLY: And Heather?
LUCY: Not yet.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, no Heather, no Susan, no Jillian.
Lucy, I'm looking - hang on here, I think here it is, yep, yep there it is. Okay, I'm printing yours homework out, Lucy.
LUCY: Okay.
HOLLY: Yours got sent out first.
COUNSELOR: I got yours, Holly, and I've got it printed out and got it ready to go. 
HEATHER: It's Heather.
COUNSELOR: Hi, Heather.
HEATHER: Hi.
COUNSELOR: Heather, did you - because I know you did the homework before group last week. Have you done anymore and I just didn't find it or get it printed out?
HEATHER: No, I didn't do - I've been reading everyone's, but I didn't do anymore.
COUNSELOR: Okay, no problem. 
I'm just printing out Lucy's, which came in a while back but I didn't get it.
So I was telling everybody else Susan will hopefully be here. I got a message from her earlier about being in a meeting she's hoping to get out of to be in group. And Phyllis is out of town, and Sylvia's going to be late.
JULIE: I think someone keeps trying to call in, but I don't recognize the number. I thought maybe it was someone from group, but I guess not. 
COUNSELOR: Hmm.
JULIE: Never mind, okay.
COUNSELOR: We call in on the same number all the time. I would think that Heather or Jillian would probably remember that, but I'm not positive.
Okay. And Susan is in - they're not real close together, but they're all in that same area code.
HOLLY: What's wrong with that area code? I'm sorry.
COUNSELOR: Actually, Julie said that somebody was trying to call in on her line and it was - they keep trying to call in, and it's a number I don't off the hand recognize.
HOLLY: Oh, I see, so it might be someone that doesn't remember the number to call.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Was that you Heather?
HEATHER: Yeah, I'm here.
COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. Good, good.
HEATHER: I thought you knew I was here. Sorry.
COUNSELOR: I'm sorry, I was probably distracted with printing stuff out. So are we just waiting for Susan and Jillian?
HOLLY: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So we're just waiting for two more. 
But I know that most of you have the handout called "Recovery Attributes," kind of our recovery promises... I give that handout at the beginning of working with somebody. And so you all would have gotten it at some point. But I'm going to send it back out because it kind of helps us hang onto the promises of recovery when we feel a little down.
And - can we - Holly can we go ahead and start with you? Because I could tell you were feeling a little down, but I was so impressed with the work you did even though you were down. All I wrote was wow on the side. So - has everybody had a chance to pull Holly's homework out?
JULIE: No.
HEATHER: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I'm going to go ahead and read it. She did it on body image, and she picked the spiritual principles of honesty, surrender and love. 
But preceding that, she talked to the group and she said she had an incredible amount of resistance to the exercise, but then commented she's had a lot of resistance to a lot of concepts that would be good for her lately. 
And then she talked about - Holly I don't think it was when you and I talked, so it must have been with your sponsor. She said she had talked recently to somebody about the fear of having to be locked down and withdrawing. 
And I'm going to guess that what you meant by that is your pattern of locking down kind of emotionally and withdrawing physically. Does that sound right?
HOLLY: (Inaudible)
COUNSELOR: Was that yes?
HOLLY: I'm sorry, am I not coming in clearly?
COUNSELOR: No, I think I may have a bad line. We've got really high winds in my area, and it's affected my phone lines.
HOLLY: Oh, okay.
JILIAN: It's me. 
COUNSELOR: Hey, Jillian.
Then Holly, you go on to say, "If I didn't have a commitment to show up to this group and do my part to participate, I would withdraw now."
And then you said, "I just don't feel" - and put feel in quotes - "like I have anything to share nor do I want to. I just want to curl up in my house and pretend that my problems are going to just magically go away."
And next she says that, "A job will just present itself and I'll know whether I'm to stay in my current field or change, and that my weight gain isn't the beginning of the end, and that we will find a solution."
So then she goes on to say, "It's my nature to hide out - hide out and eat, but that is not an option today. So I'll just hide out and feel ashamed that I'm not better than this, not more spiritually fit."
And then in parentheses, she put, "What a load of ego and crap." (Laughs.) And then she says, "Okay, I've bitched enough."
But Holly, I want to comment on that just because I know when we're in it, it does feel like it is us, but a lot of that sounds so typical addiction chatter. And so I would have encouraged you to say, "I can hear the addiction telling me, 'just curl up and don't go out'," you know, that addiction, best friend chatter, rather than identifying it as you.
So I think you're probably right that you have a pattern of, you know, kind of withdrawing as well, but the addiction really buddies up with it.
HOLLY: Right.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay.
So then she goes on to say - and this is the part that just blew me away - it says, the topic is body image using the spiritual principles of honesty, surrender and love, what's the mental expression? 
And she wrote, "My abstinence has a bottom line, but my food choices are fluid and dependent on my health issues. My body is not my enemy. My age is not my enemy to my body. There are solutions. My job is to seek with love... not judgment and punishment. I can grieve the loss of my body's abilities; I just can't stay there and wallow." 
And then she took this physical expression, and it says, "I can walk and give my body the exercise it craves. I can talk lovingly to it instead of harshly. I can pay attention to headaches and look for signs that I am having trouble." 
And the next one says, "Not give into the 'what's the use anyway chatter' that runs through my head, which is definitely the addiction in my opinion."
So she wrote similar on career, but I want to talk about the body image stuff because it's such a big arena. And I thought, Holly, for as much as you kind of griped around at the beginning or, you know, you labeled it "bitched around" at the beginning, you really shifted through it and you just dropped into such wonderful, wise wisdom. 
So how did you feel after you wrote that?
HOLLY: Like I wanted Julie's homework.
COUNSELOR: (Laughs.)
HEATHER: What did you say? What did you learn?
HOLLY: I wanted Julie's homework when I read hers. Hers was much more spiritual. (Laughter.)
COUNSELOR: Oh, poor sweetie. Yeah.
Well I hope that you hear that this was a message that was for your inner family, and you did a really, really good job. 
Even if somebody in there - and it sounds like a little bit of the tormenter energy that's the addiction. If the tormenter's kind of got a foothold at the moment, particularly around the body image issues, hanging onto this part you wrote, maybe printing it out, putting up on the fridge, put it on your mirror in your bathroom so that you can kind of drop into that heart compassion when you feel yourself kind of off, that it's real handy for you. Does that make sense?
HOLLY: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
JULIE: You know what's good about Holly - you know the first part that you wrote, I felt that plenty of times too that I felt like that and I'm sure we all have, and you just mustered up the energy to get to group. And if we didn't have the group to go to I might isolate... so I mean I just really identified with everything that you wrote, and I know that we all feel that way at times.
And you're so good at feeling that way and then going ahead and doing the homework, where I just would have wrote that e-mail as my excuse to not show up. So I just thought it was so great that you wrote that and then still did the homework, where when I'm feeling that way, I can't even muster up anything to even do the homework. So I thought that that was really great.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. So Holly did it feel like it shifted you at all as you finished the exercise?
HOLLY: Yeah, because, I know that what is in front of me right now is this tremendous amount of fear.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
HOLLY: - and you know, it's overwhelming.
I cried through the exercise. But I know that if I don't start walking through this stuff, then I just will retreat, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
HOLLY: I will just keep finding things to put in my way, you know, reasons not to move forward, you know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, exactly.
HOLLY: It will become familiar.
COUNSELOR: You know, I've probably talked about it before, but there are three questions to ask ourselves that help move us through that period. The three things that really help when we get in that state...ones that pull us back into our spiritual wisdom is, "Where is God". Just ask ourself "where is God," because when we get into fear, we're acting like we're doing our life alone. So we're acting like the fear is bigger than God, right? So if we just say to ourselves, "Where is God," it pulls us back into that knowingness.
The second one is, "What's the spiritual truth"... meaning about a particular situation? And you kind of have articulated it in this homework. That's why I think printing it out will be good for you. Or just what's the truth.  The third one is, "What would Love do?"  
So usually one of those three will start to pull us back into our heart wisdom instead of our head chatter.
HOLLY: Yeah. 
JULIE: I need to be hearing this all too. (Laughs.)
COUNSELOR: Is that you, Heather?
JULIE: No, it's - JULIE. 
HOLLY: I have a friend, and she's actually a woman I sponsor, and I see her spiritual connection... her trust in always being taken care of, and I just marvel at it, and I think, "My God, I would love to have a spiritual connection."
And then she says, "Well, I turn to you for my spiritual guidance." 
And I say, what's going on here. You know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well I know that you've been sober so long and you sponsor a lot of people, when you move into that energy of sponsoring, it seems to drop you into that heart wisdom. When you get into your own issue around your body image, you stay in your head chatter. Am I right?
HOLLY: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And so if you can, just bring that wisdom that you use when you sponsor, bring it to you. Your inner family deserves that same wisdom you bring to those lucky women that, you know, you sponsor.
So that's why the question, where is God, kind of helps us pull into that sponsoring of ourselves. Pull into being the parent to our inner family. So yeah, I think all of us identify - as Heather said, all of us identify with being in that place that you're in at the moment. I think we all get there. The goal is to know that when we get there, we can wallow around a little while, but then we can use our recovery tools to shift us out of that place.. 
Sometimes I need to throw what I call a spiritual fit, you know. My prayer: "Dear God, I don't like this, I don't want this, I would not pick that, but I'm willing to believe you know more than I know and so instead of just being mad about it, I'm going to thank you for it and trust that it is in divine order."
So, you know, I need to kind of throw a fit sometimes, but then to move in - back into that wisdom that is in our hearts, you know, move back into that sane, recovery place. 
I'd like to go ahead and switch over - I don't want to skip over your career work, Holly. I'm doing this topic inventory stuff, but I'd like to switch back over to Julie's because hers was on body image as well, and it might kind of tie in together. Is that okay? I think - Sylvia did some on body image, and so maybe I'll tie them all three together. So let me grab Julie - yeah, Julie's. 
Julie picked the topic, again, of body image. She picked the spiritual principle of compassion. And then her mental expressions are, "I have compassion for what my body has been through in the past. I am grateful for my body holding itself together. I am grateful there's the strength and abilities that my body has. I release the expectations that my body should be something else than what it is."
Physical expression: "I exercise out of love and compassion for my body rather than hatred for how it looks. I don't push my body, and allow it to rest when needed. I take the time to heal when sick. I choose positive self-talk when looking in the mirror."
And I think, again, reading it from somebody else's words, but the essence is pretty much the same even though Julie, you picked compassion where Holly picked honesty, surrender and love, the essence was still from that kind of wonderful, spiritual place.
So any feedback Julie about your homework? 
JULIE: It's just that's it was really hard for me. This is what I do struggle with, you know, daily. And it's just I think more and more trying to get to that point of compassion versus just being my body's own worst enemy. It's how I talk to it and how I treat it. And just trying to put the compassion into words... because they're almost like affirmations for me, so this is what I can do to get me from day to day.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
JULIE: And it's so hard for me to go back to that. So I really enjoyed writing those out as, you know, let's hope that I can try to incorporate them or look at them daily... that it can become more real. Because I am my body's worst enemy for sure.
COUNSELOR: So when it comes to the body image issue, you know how I talk about everybody go watch the movie "A Beautiful Mind" because that movie about <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span><a href="#schizophrenia1" style="padding-left:2px;"><img alt="Next Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/nexthit.gif" /></a></span> is so similar to eating addictions, meaning, you know, he had the tormentor voice, he had the best friend voice, he had the little girl voice in his mental illness. In our case, our addiction has a physical predisposition... you know, <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#schizophrenia0" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia1"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> has a biological base as well. 
So addictions have a biological base, and they chat with us as well. But we think it's us. So our tormentor voice...Holly, you're the one that wrote about your tormentor voice. And when it comes to body image, that probably is where the tormentor voice is the strongest. When it comes to the addiction voice that uses the best friend ploy... it's the one that tries to seduce us with the isolating... You know the voice that says, "Nobody really is worth the effort anyway... who needs them... they don't really understand."  But the tormentor voice is usually the one that we experience the most around our body. 
And once I realized that if my neighbor said to me what the addiction said to me inside my head, I wouldn't buddy around with that neighbor... if my neighbor said it to me outside, like, "Come on over, let's have brownies," you know, or, "Your butt looks big in those jeans." 
I would not pay any attention to that woman. But if it happens inside my head, I think I have to take it seriously. Do you know what I'm saying? 
You both did an exquisite job of putting into words what the tormentor energy says around the body image issue, and also really put words to embracing the loving compassionate view of our body.
Anybody else have any feedback about those two? 
Sylvia, are you there? No, guess she's not there yet.  Well, Sylvia wrote one on body image too, but I was kind of waiting for her to be on the call, but she called and said she was going to be late. So Jillian, that's you talking right?
JILIAN: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Did you want to add some feedback? Go ahead.
JILIAN: First of all, I know I didn't even want to call in today because I've been feeling so emotional about like a lot of things. 
And not being able to have a computer at home has made it worse. I'm frustrated with myself because I feel like I'm not participating enough in the group. But it's everything that you guys talked about... it so resonates to what I'm dealing with.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
JILIAN: And I just want to apologize to the group for not being able to get the homework sent out. And I don't know what it is. I think Holly, you kind of mentioned the resistance, but it's not the only reason... I just don't know. 
You know, working in a restaurant and not wanting to be there...I don't want to be in that whole restaurant scene at all, so I'm just really overwhelmed. I had like pizza two or three times a day 
COUNSELOR: See - what was that last part?
JILIAN: It's pizza; like that's the easiest thing for me to eat right now.
COUNSELOR: So you're having pizza three times a day?
JILIAN: Well, for two or three meals a day. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
JILIAN: That's just what's comfortable
COUNSELOR: But it's a moderate serving of pizza, right?
JILIAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Well high fives to you, Jillian, that's all I can say.
JILIAN: (Laughs.): It's embarrassing though.
 
COUNSELOR: No, are you kidding, the fact that you're staying abstinent? This is like, you know, a cheering squad behind you.
JILIAN: It's not the way I wanted it to go.
COUNSELOR: Well, you know what, you know the client I told you about - the peppermint patty story.
JILIAN: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And for her it was really important to put a peppermint patty with breakfast, one with lunch and one with dinner... she put one little peppermint patty with meal to prove to herself this is not a diet. She was a little worried that she would be eating peppermint patties the rest of her life... but I told her she'll be so sick of them in a few weeks, not to worry about it.  And that was true...And I think, for you anyway, having the pizza a couple times of day right now - in moderation - is going to take you the direction you want to go in.
JILIAN: I feel like it's so stupid. (Laughs.)
COUNSELOR: Does anybody else -
LUCY: You're not the only one that's doing that Jillian!
COUNSELOR: But does anybody else think it's a stupid idea?
HEATHER: No.
COUNSELOR: To do that when you're in your beginning phase?
HEATHER: No, I don't think it is
HOLLY: I think we all - no one jumps to perfection.
COUNSELOR: No.
HEATHER: I mean it just doesn't happen over night. I mean, I had an all-sweets meal the other day; that was my meal.. I mean, pizza's a lot healthier than that.  And I feel I should be past that too.
COUNSELOR: Yes, yes, okay. All right. 
HEATHER: In my mind, I should be doing better than having an all-sweets meal.
COUNSELOR: But you know what, you're not having them five days a week.
HEATHER: I'm not, no. I'm not, but I do remember at the beginning of my abstinence, that my meals were not great... they've gotten better now than they used to be.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, there you go.
HEATHER: So it gets better over time, Jillian. It does.
JILIAN: Thanks, Heather.
HOLLY: Yeah.
JULIE: And it's the whole thing about the perfectionism.
COUNSELOR: Yes, it is.
JILIAN: It's like I totally can relate to exactly like Holly and Julie or, you know, I've known them a lot longer than any of the other girls.
COUNSELOR: Yes.
JILIAN: But it's like - I'm like yes, you totally relate to that! And I'm just sick of dealing with that type perfectionist.
COUNSELOR: Well would you do me a favor, Jillian?
JILIAN: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Would - when you get off the phone, I want you to grab the pen and paper and I want you to write "perfectionism" at the top of the page. And underneath it, I want you to write this question. 
JILIAN: Hold on a second, let me -
COUNSELOR: Okay. And anybody else who wants to do this exercise, it'd be great since perfection is a probably a universal problem for us, particularly in the beginning.
JILIAN: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Are you ready? So "perfectionism" at the top, and a question - I'm going to have you write a question right underneath it. And the question is, "What would God have me believe about perfectionism?" 
And then I want you to answer what you think God would have you believe about perfectionism. And then I want you to call and tell me you're ready to read it to me.
JILIAN: And you know what, I'm thinking this whole experience of recovery is teaching me to be more open.  I want to be more spiritual... and I feel awful not being able to even get to like the library to get online.
COUNSELOR: So that's why we're going to kind of modify it for you. 
JILIAN: (Laughs.)
COUNSELOR: You know, Sylvia doesn't have a computer at home either. She, what did she call herself, technologically handicapped or something?
Is that you, Sylvia?
SYLVIA: Yes, it's Sylvia.
COUNSELOR: Hi, Sylvia. 
I was just giving you use some praise about when I said, "Oh, do you have cell phone? You could call in on the cell phone." 
And you said, "No, I'm technologically handicapped." Or whatever you said, I couldn't remember the phrase. Do you remember the phrase you used?
SYLVIA: No.
COUNSELOR: But I was just saying to Jillian, you know, because she's kind of feeling really bad that she hasn't gotten to the computer and hasn't gotten her homework done regularly, but she is staying abstinent. And so we were all cheering her on about that. And then she said that she's been feeling bad because she's been having pizza for lunch and dinner every day - (laughs) - in moderation.
SYLVIA: In moderation.
COUNSELOR: And we were all giving her a high five on that one.
SYLVIA: Good, good.
COUNSELOR: But I had just suggested a homework assignment. And so I'll reiterate the homework assignment in case anybody else wants to do it. 
I had her take a piece of paper and put "perfectionism" on the top, and then a question underneath. And the question is, "What would God have me believe about perfectionism." 
And then I said go ahead and write on it what you think God would have you say or, you know, what your spirit or your soul would want you to know about it. Use the God or higher power, whatever word you'd like to use. 
And then I said to Jillian, and when you've got it written, I want you give me a call and let me know you're ready to read it to me. You can call me. You can call Julie. You can call Holly. You can call Lucy. You can call Heather. You know, you guys can all call each other or if you want to get to the computer because that's the easiest thing for you, that's fine too. You know, start using the phone a little bit more. And yI've got the 800 number, and you know I can call you back. So would you be willing to do that exercise?
SYLVIA: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay, good. Good.
Let me see. Sylvia, you had written on body image, and I had just gone over Holly's and Julie's, which were just marvelous. And I wanted to hold off on yours because yours brought tears to my eyes and I wanted to make you sure were online. Yours was so touching.
SYLVIA: Thank you.
COUNSELOR: She wrote - and anybody who hasn't had a chance to read it, she wrote on body image. And then she wrote a little paragraph that says, "My self esteem has been damaged by my internal voices due to being overweight for 16 years and having an eating disorder for 45 or more years." 
And then she says the spiritual principle she's picking is love. 
But before she got into the mental expression, she wrote this - this is the part that really touched me. And so here's what she wrote: "Forgiving myself for using food, compulsive overeating as an avoidance for living in a scary, unsupportive family; forgiving my parents for doing the best they could with their limited resources; and letting go of the blame for my need to medicate with extra calories to numb myself from scary adult behavior. 
"Love is the ultimate expression of being whole and working with steps towards wellness. Being abstinent will give me the beginning of self-esteem to move toward the light and leave behind my old, nonworking behaviors. I deserve to live a good life, and I have inner resources to make healthy choices and change my old self and create a new life."
All my inner family just felt like somebody gave them a big, big hug. So thank you for that.
SYLVIA: You're welcome. What I'm trying to do was to describe what I would do if I was doing the love thing.  So I figured that's where I would start.
COUNSELOR: Good, I think it was wonderful.
And her mental expressions are, "The affirmation of I'm getting healthier, I do not need to look in the mirror and think negative thoughts. The years have gone by, and my active eating disorder, I can stop beating myself up. I can accept my body and my looks. I do not need to look in the mirror and obsess about my wrinkles. I feel happy, and I am mentally well. I have a flexible, strong body. Looks are not my value as a person. I look fine for 50." 
I think there's a little minus sign there, so I didn't know if you're a little over or a little under 50. I couldn't remember.
SYLVIA: No, exactly.
COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.
"I look clear and well and interesting and fun. I can now accept my body and enjoy my life. I am getting leaner through abstinence."
And those were just, again, really sweet, wonderful ones. 
The physical expression says, "As I practice my spiritual principles, I will become more complete in my understanding and behaviors. I can enact the ways of a whole woman who is healthy and clear. 
"And that I stay abstinent and, through the program, I will build my feelings of gratitude and my belief in my own deservedness in a good life. I will exercise more to honor and support my lean - not yet - fit body, and will let go of negative self-talk around body image issues. 
"I will stop looking in the mirror with critical eyes and will look with love. I am alive and healthy, and I am now preparing to enter the most powerful time in my life, bringing all the energy and wisdom of my younger days into my current life."
Is that just wonderful you guys?
HOLLY: That's sweet.
COUNSELOR: So nice.
HEATHER: Very beautiful.
JULIE: These are great affirmations to say.
COUNSELOR: Oh my God, aren't they though? S o Sylvia, did you want to add anything to how you felt when you wrote it?
SYLVIA: Well, you know, I've been thinking about it a lot... it's kind of humbling to mention, but as I'm getting thinner, I - you know, because I'm 50 I guess - I'm developing sort of like, you know, where I used to have like a double chin under my neck -
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
SYLVIA: Now I have sort of a - like a bag thing.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
SYLVIA: Okay, I realize that if I look at it every time I go to the mirror, I'm really unhappy.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
SYLVIA: So, what I'm going to do instead - I just came to this over the weekend. I am going to not go to the mirror with a critical thought. 
I'm going to just go and say... you know what, I have a friend who has breast cancer and a 45-year-old friend of mine dropped dead a year ago of a brain aneurism. A lot of my friends - people are having things happen. You know, stuff is happening.
COUNSELOR: Right.
SYLVIA: And so I thought, you know what? I'm alive and I'm healthy, and now that I'm doing this work, I'm even mentally healthier. 
So I am going to stop going to the mirror and judging myself based on some weird look. And I'm going to just know that I am the kind of person who basically likes to have fun and I want to just focus on the fact that I'm okay, you know, and so if I can do that and drop the body image nonsense that I've been really upset with, you know.
COUNSELOR: Right.
SYLVIA: I'm not saying I'm there, but that's what I wanted to work on also. And the other reason I started with that was I saw that the other people had done such a great job - Julie, and Lucy. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
SYLVIA: I had read ahead. Their homework was so brilliant around food stuff, I figured I'd work on that later on, like this week. I thought I'd go with something different on the body image. Plus it's been a big issue since I turned 50. 
COUNSELOR: So you've got kind of the age-appropriate aging issues coming up that are piled on top of the body image issues that go with any eating addiction.
SYLVIA: Right.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And Holly, you're got seven years of abstinence. But I think the fact that you're also about 50. Didn't you just turn 50, Holly?
HOLLY: I'm 52.
COUNSELOR: Fifty-two. So I think that those aging issues are being mapped on, so any residue of body image issues is kind of up and in your face about it.
And Lucy, are you 40-something?
LUCY: I'm 45, yes.
COUNSELOR: Forty-five, so I would guess you're kind of skirting around that issue as well.
LUCY: Big time, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, big time. (Laughs.)
LUCY: I have that thing hanging from my neck too.
COUNSELOR: (Laughs.) What do they call that, the waddle or -
LUCY: Chicken neck.
COUNSELOR: Chicken neck, the waddle. 
Well I - Lucy, you wrote on body image too, so let's go ahead and wrap up on the body image one by going over yours, which I thought that the simplicity of yours was so right on. 
So here's what Lucy wrote. She picked for the topic of body image, the spiritual principle of acceptance. The mental expressions, "I look at my body with acceptance and appreciation. I look at my body as a gift." Isn't that a wonderful one? "I look at my body as healthy. I appreciate my strength."
The physical expression, "I eat healthy food. I put exercise as a priority in my life. I am abstinent. I eat moderately. I try not to judge and know that when I do that it is disease chatter."
And the next one says, "When I need to rest, I rest." And those could go up on the refrigerator as well. 
JILIAN: You know, I just want to - it's Jillian real quick. Just want to say something for Lucy -  - that I remember when I was in San Diego, and I'm just so amazed by how much growth and how much you've learned. I'm just really happy for you.
LUCY: Thank you, Jillian.
HEATHER: Yeah.
JILIAN: And I feel the same way about you too. It's like -
HOLLY: Oh - hey, go Jillian with your abstinence because I know how hard it is to get abstinence.
JILIAN: You know, because I haven't talked to you on the phone or e-mail or anything, so I just - didn't mean to interrupt or anything, but I just wanted to let you know that.
COUNSELOR: That's really nice feedback, Jillian. Really nice to hear that. 
LUCY: Really nice.
COUNSELOR: Also to just kind of insert here that I think Lucy told the group last week, I'm not positive but I know she's told me, that she's going to have to drop out of the next 10 week session. I think she's going to be traveling four or more of the 10 sessions. And she's going to go ahead and check in with us by either e-mail and phone sessions with me. 
But I - and I mentioned this to Lucy. I have a client in Holland who - you know, there's a nine hour time difference from the West Coast, and the only group she can have an option for is the day group and the day group's been full for quite a while. And I told her the other day I'm going to have one spot available for 10 weeks, and she started to cry. 
She is so happy about getting to be in a group for 10 weeks. So I just wanted to let you guys know that we are going to - but this gal's name is Miko and Miko is going to join us for the 10 week session that Lucy's not here. 
But Lucy, I'm going to go ahead and include you in all of the e-mails so that even though you're not on the calls, you're not out of the loop.
LUCY: Thank you.
COUNSELOR: Okay, good deal.
All right. And I want to talk about - let's see. Holly did one on career, which I think, Jillian that resonated with you. So let me go back to Holly's and do the one on career.
Holly picked the topic of career, the spiritual principle of desire and perseverance. The mental expression: "I will believe that God will help me find my right place. I will believe that this process will produce the right job with the right amount of finances to support for my family. I believe that God is guiding and directing my life. My job is the footwork."
The thing I noticed here, Holly, and I don't know if you noticed that. The first two said, "I will believe," like you're just trying to start at the beginning of believing those, but the last one, you were absolutely - "I believe that God is guiding and directing my life." 
HOLLY: It's something that I say, and it's a saying I have on my desk.
COUNSELOR: So the last one is the more important one... the other two are a little newer, but you're moving toward them as well?
HOLLY: Right.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Under physical expression, she wrote, "I will hold myself accountable to what I say I will do. I will take the time to work on the homework given to me by my coach." 
And I think you have a gal that you use as a coach for your career stuff, right?
HOLLY: A career coach, right.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay. The last one says, "I will follow through on the leads that I am given."
And so any feedback on how you felt when you kind of did the career topic inventory?
HOLLY: It's something that I've been struggling with... that I'm given assignments and I just get busy in anything but those assignments.
COUNSELOR: Ah, yeah. You mean by the coach - by the career coach?
HOLLY: Right. It's just, you know, I just get busy and...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
HOLLY: I mean I have a really busy life, and I just get very full and busy and then we have scheduled appointments. And one is Saturday, and it's like I'm going to be flying to get this stuff done that she's given me to do.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.  How often do you meet with her, Holly, once a week?
HOLLY: No, it's usually every two, you know, two to three weeks. 
COUNSELOR: Okay, well let me make a suggestion then that if you want to use me for the accountability check in - not that I'll give you any necessarily feedback. But just to say, "Josephine, this is what I'm going to try to get at this week from my career coach, and so I'll check back in with you Friday and let you know what I've got done." 
Then Monday, you say, "Okay, this is what I've got in front of me. I'm not meeting for her for another 10 days. I'll check in with you Friday." 
Do you know what I'm saying?
HOLLY: Right.
COUNSELOR: About using just my phone number as a way to keep you accountable since there's so many one to two to three weeks between sessions with her.
HOLLY: Right. Oh, yes, you know my sponsor also said kind of the same thing.
COUNSELOR: Okay, good.
HOLLY: And I'm resistant to it, you know, and so that's why I needed to write it again.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
HOLLY: I have to be accountable for my work. You know, this is the one where the biggest fear is. I don't know if it's the biggest, but these two that I chose to write on are my biggest fears. 
And so yeah, using the resources or using the help that people have offered me and not feeling like a loser around it.
COUNSELOR: Right.
HOLLY: Because fear sometimes overwhelms me.
COUNSELOR: Well again, when it overwhelms you, try that sentence, "Where is God?" Because I know you have a strong spiritual base.
HLLY: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And I think just that one phrase will pull you back to it.
HOLLY: Right.
COUNSELOR: Because fear can kind of grow... once we kind of get into it and on a roll, it's very hard to pull back. Am I right you guys?
HOLLY: Right.
HEATHER: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And so the minute you catch it, if we can say, "Where is God?" We don't even get on that roll where it kind of sucks you in. 
So the more you get used to using that phrase, maybe the sooner you can intervene on it. Because it sounds like God's brought that one to the forefront for you. He's brought the body image and the aging to the forefront for you. But the reason they're in the forefront is you're ready. You know, spiritually you're ready. That's how I look at it.
HOLLY: Okay. (Laughter.)
COUNSELOR: Okay. (Laughs.) Well, who was that that said okay. Was that your 15 year old that said that Holly? (Laughter.)
HOLLY: Ain't she just a butterfly of good news. (Laughter.)
COUNSELOR: That was great. Your tone was wonderful on that one. (Laughter.)
All right, when - as I went over that one, Jillian, did that kind of inspire you to do a little work on your career stuff and adopt some of Holly's?
JILIAN: Yeah, I need to just... Oh no, my home phone battery is dying. This is my cell phone. 
Let me switch phones and then I can -
COUNSELOR: Okay, go ahead and call back.
JILIAN: OK
COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay. All right. I know that Julie wrote on exercising, as did Lucy, right? 
No, you wrote on healthy eating, that's right. You wrote on healthy eating and abstinence. So let's go ahead and do the exercise one because that's probably a pretty universal one for most of us. Am I right? Did nobody else write on it at this particular point? Right, okay. 
HOLLY: We all just thought it. (Laughter)
COUNSELOR: We all just thought it. We let Julie write it.
Okay, topic healthy exercising. She picked the spiritual principle of willingness. Here's the mental expression: "I think of exercise as a way to relieve stress and bring health to my body rather than just sculpt it. Exercise is not used to punish my body. I release the anxiety and shame if I cannot get to the gym. I realize many forms of healthy exercise - I realize the many forms of healthy exercise that are available to me instead of a gym full of mirrors and scales. I view exercise as a practice that benefits my body as a whole rather than just looking at it to lose weight."
So those are her mental expressions.
JILIAN: I'm back.
COUNSELOR: Is that you back? Okay, good.
Now the physical expressions of healthy exercising topic, willingness as a principle, here's the physical expression: "I exercise despite how I feel about my body. Just like the concept of not changing a meal based on emotional ups and downs, I do not change my exercise routine based on emotional ups and downs with my body image."
And I thought that one was so brilliantly put that we all could type that one out and put it on our fridge, you know. 
The next one says, "I listen to my body and choose more gentle forms of exercise if I am sick or very tired." 
The next one says, "I use exercise as my medicine for my mental well-being."
Again, absolutely wonderful one. Any feedback on that, Julie?
JULIE: Yeah, exercise was my form of purging. And you know, I was a dancer and then I was a trainer, so I've had this kind of unhealthy relationship with exercising.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
JULIE: And I think for me was one page on ups and downs. Like if I'm feeling you know too big and so I don't want to go out, I don't want people to see me. You know, so that whole thing of having how I feel about myself dictate whether or not I should exercise. I really just needed to see it as the addiction  mentally...once I did, then lately I feel so much better. 
And so I'm trying to work on that on my meals, and thinking about how I should apply the recovery mentality to exercise. Because I don't want to exercise just to change how my body looks. I want to exercise for all the benefits because there are so many.
COUNSELOR: Right.
JULIE: It's better to not go to the gym with all the mirrors and scales, you know. Instead, I can go on a walk, or I can do yoga, or I can, you know, run around and play soccer. 
COUNSELOR: And you guys all remember, again, the handout called The Secret of Healthy Nourishing where I talk about the intent in which we take the action.
JULIE: No, that was one of my favorite ones. I love that a lot.
COUNSELOR: And the point I'm trying to make is that just, like you were saying Julie, if you go to the gym out of disgust or hate or shame, those energies of disgust and hate and shame are what impact the chemical balance in our body. 
If we go for a walk to like - I think Holly had one around, you know, walking for exercise for their body. Maybe it was - yeah, I think it was Holly. But anyway, if we're doing it to see the beauty in God's world, give our legs a stretch, to make our body strong, you know that's like enjoyment and love and appreciation is the energy that's going to be coursing through our body as opposed to the negative ones. And I tell you, that changes your chemistry. All of the negative emotions are breaking down the immune system. So no matter how much you exercise, you're probably not going to be in great health. 
Again if you reverse it and you exercise by walking and enjoying nature and knowing that it's just going to make that day feel better and - I think some of you already know that exercising really helps with the tendency for depression, et cetera. But if you're doing it to like give your body the best day possible, and you know, enjoy the strength of your body, a different energy is going to be moving through your body. 
Do you guys, you know, right? 
PARTICIPANTS: Yes.
COUNSELOR: And so that shifting the intent of exercising is really powerful... Julie, yours really reflected that.
JULIE: Yeah, it was a good one for me to do. I knew that was just something that I needed to do. And I didn't really think about it, but they just kind of came up and I'm glad that I chose that one.
COUNSELOR: Me too.  The one that I make up for me is "Exercise is my physical part of health insurance."
HOLLY: (Laughs.) That's great.
COUNSELOR: You know, you can't just write a check and think your health is taken care of.
LUCY: No.
COUNSELOR: So the physical part - the exercise is one of my physical parts. And then, as I've gotten older, I've added weight bearing as I've aged because it's even more critical. You know, it was one thing at 40 to say fit and active. It's another thing as I approach 63, and it'll be another thing at 85. You know? So it becomes a more and more valuable commodity.
I want to have a chance, Julie, to go over another one of yours. You did - she did nutritional eating and abstinence. And so I'm going to go ahead and do the abstinence once, Julie. Is that okay?
JULIE: Mm-hmm.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Julie picked out -
HOLLY: You guys, I'm going to get mobile. I'm going to be driving to actually pick up my husband.
COUNSELOR: Is that Holly?
HOLLY: Yeah, so if you hear car type things, I'm going to stay on the phone but I've got to be moving and I thought I should tell you.
COUNSELOR: Well, if you wanted to mute - if you notice that there's lots of noise or background noise, just hit the six and then the six mutes you. And then when you're ready to come back in, you could hit again and it unmutes you.
HOLLY: Okay. I can mute.
COUNSELOR: Okay. 
JILIAN: Bye.
LUCY: Bye.
COUNSELOR: So, Holly picked the topic of abstinence and the spiritual principles of honesty and surrender. 
Her mental expression: "I am honest about what I eat. I choose to surrender to abstinence for the rest of my life knowing that it is what keeps my sane and at peace and not in my disease. I keep a realistic view. I can abstain, nourish my body, and enjoy food. I understand and accept that abstinence is my medicine, and there are no circumstances that should make me deviate from abstinence."
The next one: "I fully surrender to three meals a day, nothing in between."
The next one: "I honestly appreciate the gift of abstinence for my body and my soul."
Isn't that wonderful?
HOLLY: Great.
COUNSELOR: "The gift of abstinence is for my body and my soul."
Okay, physical expressions, meaning all the actions, behaviors, foot works that reflect the spiritual principle in relationship to that topic. 
Okay, first one: "I take advantage of the tools if I ever feel that my abstinence is at risk." and by that, the tools, you mean the phone calling, the writing, the visualizing.
HOLLY: Right.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Those physical actions, got it. Okay. 
"I am honest about my food choices." And I'm going to guess because you put that one under physical expression that you mean, "I'm going to make sure I tell somebody, there's no secret." Okay.
The next one says, "I don't keep secrets about my eating or my food, or the food that I choose." Which Jillian was perfect telling us about her pizza thing. (Laughs.)
PARTICIPANTS: (Laughs.)
COUNSELOR: The next one says, "I surrender to feeling hungry sometimes and that it's okay."
And the next one says, "I'm grateful to my abstinence and my group and Josephine and my Higher Power for this gift."
And the next one says, "I do gratitude lists." 
And I think that is such a wonderful, wonderful tool, you guys, is to be grateful as a heart and mindset. So even if it's - say like Holly knows she's got certain things kind of going on around career, to still be really clear how grateful she is that she has a wonderful husband and a great house and his health and her health and, you know, good relationships with others. And even if we've got one arena that's kind of a struggle, we're can be very, very clear about all the other things to put on gratitude lists. 
So I think - I was really glad you put that one on there Holly.
HOLLY: Well a couple weeks ago, I was really, really struggling. And you had mentioned to do the gratitude list, and I hadn't done it in a long time. And I started doing it daily, and it helped so much. Because I've been around the fear a lot, too, lately, especially you know a couple of weeks ago. I was really in it. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
HOLLY: And that just helped so much to just get pen to paper and, you know, write in my journal and just make lists of, you know, gratitude lists.
COUNSELOR: Okay, yeah.
HOLLY: It was just - it was amazing.
COUNSELOR: Well I hope everybody heard that because I think if we've ever tried that tool, we all can remember what an important tool it is. So good, I'm glad you did that. 
Anybody have any other feedback on her work on abstinence? No? Okay.
All right, I'm going to go ahead and go on to the - on nutritional eating. The topic is nutritional eating. The spiritual principle is love. Here is the mental expressions that Lucy wrote down. "I treat my bodies nutritional needs with the same attention and care a healthy, loving parent would."
Next one, "Through my food and drink quality choices, I am making amends to my health and my body. I keep a realistic view. I can abstain, nourish my body and enjoy food. I understand and accept the difference between my abstinence, which is my medicine, and nutritionally healthy eating. I desire to pray before meals, especially dinner, and ask for willingness for moderation. I treat myself in a loving manner instead of a hateful manner." 
So those are her mental expressions, which were absolutely beautiful.
Physical expressions - again all the actions, behavior and footwork that reflect that spiritual principle in relation to that topic. "I take the time to create and use a grocery shopping list." 
When I had that residential center, I can't tell you how many women that came into the residential center, that were anywhere from 35 to 50 years old, who had not ever shopped with a grocery list. (Laughs.)
HOLLY: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: So take the time - I'm going to repeat it. "Take the time to create and use a grocery shopping list. 
"I take the time to prepare body health respectful meals."
The next one, "I know the ingredients of the substances I eat and drink because I take the time to read labels or ask. I don't label foods as good or bad but take the time to know how healthy or unhealthy they are. I am conscious during mealtime and don't wolf down my food. I take smaller bites and eat more slowly. I don't overeat at mealtime, especially dinner. I eat a healthy breakfast."
So I love the way you separated the kind of mindset ones from the action ones. You got really very distinct on the action ones. Good job.
Anybody have any feedback on the nutritionally - nutritional eating ones?
JULIE: Yeah, I really liked the realistic view that you can abstain, nourish your body and enjoy food. Because it always seems like you have to separate those. You can't possibly abstain and enjoy food, or you can't possibly nourish. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
SYLVIA: You know, it's always either you can have one or the other. So it's really nice to see that written down in that form because it is true. You can do that, but so many times if you think we can only have one and not the other. 
JILIAN: Yeah, because in one breath one girl asks me - (inaudible) - mentioned it was really hard for me. This is Jillian, by the way if anybody doesn't know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah - (laughs.)
JILIAN: I want to reiterate what Holly's saying... that it's great when you can enjoy eating, because I always enjoyed food. I enjoyed it a lot, you know. It's just great being able to enjoy breakfast, lunch and dinner and then to just let it go almost in a way. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I do think that abstinence allows us to really enjoy eating
HOLLY: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: - when we're in the active eating addiction, we may enjoy the last four bites or the first four bites, but the all the addiction-driven eating is not enjoyable. So abstinence really does open that door to enjoyment.
SYLVIA: Very, very true.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it does.
JILIAN: Yeah and I've been able to finally appreciate that. (Laughs.)
COUNSELOR: Good. Well I'm so, so glad that you're staying abstinent, that you're doing it no matter what, and I hope you don't get punitive with yourself about you don't have the computer,  and you don't get to the library often enough.
PARTICIPANT: I want you to know that I'm still very conscious about my connection to the group.
COUNSELOR: Just use your cell phone. Use the phone list. Connect with Holly more often. Call my 800 number. You know, call Julie and say, "I want to get started on the homework, but I'm not getting to the library. Can you tell me what the homework is?" You've got to use the phone a little bit more.
JILIAN: Yeah. Well, I'll work on it
COUNSELOR: All right. Well again, good job everybody, fantastic bunch of homework. Keep this as a tool and pick different topics. Any time you want to share them with each other, great. I'll go ahead and send out another homework assignment toward the end of the week. And hopefully you guys will have a chance to get working on it before next Wednesday. And that's it I guess. A big hug to you all. 
HOLLY: Thank you, guys.
COUNSELOR: All right. 
SYLVIA: Bye.
JILIAN: Okay, bye.
JULIE: Bye now.
