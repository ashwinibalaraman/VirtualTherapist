<b>DR:</b> And then we set it there, and you ignore it.  More importantly, how are you?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I feel on one level, I'm fine.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> On another level, I'm not doing anything.  I mean, uh, I go to work.  I come home and sit on the couch.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I've got all this housework and stuff that I should be doing, but I don't.  But, um, otherwise I, I feel okay.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> I haven't been in to any stores.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, still missing QVC a little bit, but not as much.
<b>DR:</b> In a range where finances are -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Not, not being impacted, [INAUDIBLE] buy it, I mean is, can you, pay the bills with them, and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I, uh, need to pay my probation money, and then I can get off probation.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, then I was in a car accident on Thursday.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, no.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I wasn't paying any attention, ran a red light.  Smashed into an SUV, and, messed my bumper all up.  Uh, I've only had the insurance since the [DATE].  So, I called them up, and I said, "Well, I want to find out just how good this insurance is."  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Did, did they have some humor about it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they did.  They did.  They did.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Hopefully, you're far enough removed from the -
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> The corporate structure with somebody that can.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He went out and looked at it.  He says, "Oh, it's not bad."  And my bumper was all smashed up, the plastic part of it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But, uh, it wasn't that bad.  Now I'm driving a PT Cruiser.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, really?  Did they give you a loaner while you're getting it fixed?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't think I'd ever buy one though.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It doesn't have the pick up and go, and, uh, it doesn't have cruise control.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, but, uh, my car should be finished yet this week.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But, uh -
<b>DR:</b> How, how have you felt you've done just in terms of your mood?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't seem to have any mood, it's just -
<b>DR:</b> Kind of level.
<b>PT:</b> Leveled out.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> Do you have much that you enjoy?  That you look forward to doing?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I've got a, a guy that I'm dating.  Um, and I enjoy getting together with him, of course.
<b>DR:</b> He's out of town, isn't he?  Do I remember that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, we were going to get together last night, and my work just went too late in the evening.  Uh -
<b>DR:</b> How many hours are you working these days?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, actually, fewer than usual.  I'm, I think I'm only working 19 hours.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I had two Alzheimer's ladies, and one went to a nursing home up in [DEIDENTIFIED], closer to her son, and the other one got placed in [DEIDENTIFIED].  So -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I don't have the extra money that I had when I was "babysitting" -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> With them.  So, uh, I'm sure they're going to give me some more clients.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But, right now, I just, I appreciate the time off that I'm not working, but, yet, in the time I'm not working, I'm not doing anything constructive with it either.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> What do you do?  I know you said you're on the couch, but, what, what kind of things are you staying busy with?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, pretty much sitting on the couch and watching TV.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I'm still not eating right.  Uh -
<b>DR:</b> Are you, by, by that, what do you mean?
<b>PT:</b> If I eat 1 meal a day, that's good.  And sometimes, I don't even eat that.  But, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Why is that?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, seems like too much effort for the little bit I would eat.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, and I'll, I'll, sit and watch TV, and 8:00 will roll around, and I'll say, "Oh, god, it's too late to eat anything."  Occasionally, I'll grab a peanut butter sandwich.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, but, uh, Sunday I got a slice of prime rib and a twice baked potato.  That's still sitting in my refrigerator.  I better eat it tonight or it's not going to be any good.  But, uh, I've gained weight, and yet my diet isn't any different that it has been.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I eat the same amount of chocolate, and I haven't, I'm not drinking more Coke than usual, and, and, uh, I'm just, uh, not, I'm not sleeping, well I'm sleeping 8 hours and that's about it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Which is good.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> Any of those thoughts, life isn't worth living?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> No, I haven't got to that point yet.  But, it's, uh, like even now, when I know my boyfriend is coming for a visit, I still don't get up and, pick up, you know?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Thing, things look the same as they did the last time he was here.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> About the only thing I do get done is, is, scrubbing up the kitchen floor after the dogs.  And, uh, so -
<b>DR:</b> Are you, are you, um, how are you doing in terms of, uh, wine, alcohol?
<b>PT:</b> Very little.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I might have, uh, one Coke with rum in it, uh, when I go up to my boyfriend's.  Uh, but usually, I did have a drink, uh, I don't know, 3 or 4 days ago, uh, oh, Super Bowl Sunday.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  There I sat all by myself watching the game, and I thought, "I can't believe I'm sitting here, watching a stupid football game."  Now I was glad that the Steelers won in the last 5 minutes, which is crazy.  My dogs thought I was nuts.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Well, that's good.  It sounds like you at least enjoyed it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Even though it, uh -
<b>PT:</b> Then I had to call [NAME OTHER] up, and I said, "I told you the Steelers would win."  He says, "Yeah, well I, I was for Arizona."  I says, "Too bad, you snooze, you lose."  I said, "Steelers won."  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> So, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Do you, are you still seeing [NAME OTHER] -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> For therapy?  How, what's your schedule with her?
<b>PT:</b> Ah, well, I missed one week because I totally forgot.  Made an appointment for the next week, but she was having surgery on her arm.  So, we haven't gotten together for about 3 weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> Do you have anything scheduled with her at this point?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm to call her, and I think she's in the office today, and -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'll call and make an appointment.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I was going to say, call and, and stay in your routine with that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, how are, are you having any problems remembering to take the Cymbalta?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Have you had enough to be able to take the -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The total dose?  Okay.  Good.  Um, and still, everything for you in terms of prescriptions is cash price?  Is that right?  I mean, there's no, you don't have any, coverage in terms of anything for -
<b>PT:</b> Um, yeah.  I, uh, I'm on a new insurance that I don't, make, have any copayments.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Will, will they cover your prescriptions?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, we could, one of the things that, that I would, would think about, um, is seeing if we can add something in with your Cymbalta to make it more effective.  I mean, I, I still think that you're, you know, you're describing that, you know, you've got, you've got a partial response to it.  You, things aren't nearly as bad as depression had been in the past, but obviously, we don't have you treated -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> As well as you have been previously.  Um, and, ah, you, you're really on a good dose of Cymbalta.  At 90 mg, I, I don't think that there's a lot of, um, room to, to see.  We've treated people to 120 mg before, but lots of times, that's more for pain issues.  And I, I think we do a lot in terms of, uh, mood.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, are there any, any new medicines or anything that's changed in that sense since we last talked?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Not really.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> I keep thinking I'm due for a physical, but I don't remember when I had my last physical.  I like to think my weight gain was due to my thyroid, but, probably due to my chocolate addiction.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Yeah, I suspect that that, uh, that that can be as much of a risk.  I mean, you know, I do, I, I think that, that we should make some changes in medicines.  Obviously, getting back into regular routine with [NAME OTHER], though I know it hasn't been that far off schedule.  But then I do think, too, those lifestyle things of saying, you know, look, what, what do I need to do to maintain a reasonable, you know, eating schedule?  And to really have that, you know, have that set up so that I'm not trying to get in a single meal right before I go to bed, but rather, you know, something, even if it's small, even if I'm not that hungry in the morning, something at, at lunch, and something at dinner.  And, and I know lots of people that really, they don't go through a lot of effort for even a couple of the meals, but still will, whether it's having, you know, something like, you know, yogurt, or having a breakfast bar -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, or, you know, a box of cereal, um, that they've got around.  You know, just, I, I think that, that small bit of calories distributed better in your day, it will help with your energy, it will help you feel a little bit more like doing things.  And I think a lot of that will, you know, is a factor also in terms of you just feeling like this is, this is going to be functional a little more like myself.
<b>PT:</b> And I found I've quit taking my vitamins.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> My iron, my fish oil.  Mainly because I know I, I'm not supposed to take it when I take my other medicine, but, I don't always have it -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Handy, like I could take it at noon.  Uh, but my noons aren't mine, because I work like, uh, until 1:00 on Monday.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And, on Tuesdays, I have 3 different clients, so, I really don't have time in between to eat anything.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh, I did buy a new lunch bag that's supposed to keep my food cold, so, hopefully with that, I can take something with me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> But, but, and I, but I do think the challenge is, and I know you have talked about this, is, less buying of the things to do it -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And more of a focus -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> On using what you've got.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know?  And I do, I know we've talked about this before about even turning that TV off or even doing without cable.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, and I know that that's something that just hasn't been anything you've wanted to give up at that level.  But, I mean, I do think that that sense of, again, both controlling spending with QVC, as well as, not having that kind of, that draw, when you do get home and you're tired -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, to just, to, to kind of park there before stopping off, and, and even, I mean, I would guess that, that even with [DEIDENTIFIED], that you're allowed to, like I said, to take some food with you, and to have something to eat.  They don't expect you necessarily not have a meal.  Uh -
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't know.  [LAUGHING].  Sometimes I wonder, the way they schedule me.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I mean, I mean, I, I understand that they may not necessarily be expecting that they're not going to, that they're going to schedule you time off for meals, but, I, I don't, I, I would expect that, nobody has issues with you if you're working a shift that covers a duration where you should be eating, that, that, they don't allow you to pull out some food while you're there, and at least have -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> A, you know, at least eat a sandwich or eat something that, you know.  But, I understand part of it is, that if we get you feeling better, part of it also is where that motivation comes from to do some of those things, too.  And, but, within the cycle, I think, trying to make those changes too is probably a factor in feeling better than you have, too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, you know, you, you, asked uh, uh, uh, previously about the Abilify.  Um, and I do, I, I think that's, that's actually, I think, that's a, a good medicine choice for you.  Uh, it works fine with the Cymbalta.  It's, um, it's a once a day medicine.  They done, in its origins, in, in terms of, uh, where it began, several years ago, it came out, it was a medicine for <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span>.  Then they found that it worked in terms of helping treat bipolar illness.  And just within the last year they've found indication, uh, in being able to add it in with an antidepressant to make the antidepressant more effective.  And it has been a very good medicine.  When we've seen it work, we've really seen it work very well for people.  Um, it's, and, and the nice thing is, is that the dosages that they used when they studied it in the, the depression studies, were actually far lower than the dosages that were necessary in terms of the other illnesses that it's indicated for.  So typically, uh, people even in the kind of a 2 to 5 mg dosage range can do very well with it, as opposed to the other conditions where it might take 15 to 30 mg.  It's a once a day medicine.  It's generally a morning medicine.  Um, I don't, most people don't find sedation with it.  Though if they at all feel a little bit tired or drowsy with it, it's usually not something that's tremendously significant, but they can certainly always switch over to bedtime.  The reason I start in the morning is that, about 20% of people that are depression studies found in the beginning that they got a little bit activated by it, and so I don't like to start it at bedtime, because then, then we're going to disrupt your sleep.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, for the most part, that was mild, tolerable, and went away.  But that's generally why we start dosages low, and like I said, the good news is, is that people generally had done well with that.  But it, if it, if that isn't anything you experience, it may be a reason why we either stop it or we back the dosage down a little bit.  Um, it's not addictive.  It's not habit forming.  Otherwise the side effect profile is, is generally very good for the medicine.  You, you mentioned you'd seen the commercials -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And they give you the litany of side effects at the end.  Um, there's class labeling for all the medicines that started out as atypical antipsychotics.  In that, there's a small percentage of people that could see a slight increase in blood sugar or blood cholesterol.  Ah, as a general rule, that's been, uh, less than 1%, and Abilify has been very favorable in terms of the, the [INAUDIBLE] for the whole family of medicines, and the Abilify has been very good in that sense.  Um, the, um, uh, a small percentage of people, I don't know if they ever told you, I know in the past you'd taken Reglan, um, a small percentage of people over a long period of time, can develop subtle movement abnormalities whether it's, it's movements of their feet, or their mouth, or their tongue.  Reglan has that same warning with it, actually.  Ah, but, again, by dose and duration, we generally don't see those things with the medicine, but it's important for people to know about.  Um, the medicine can be discontinued at any point.  There's no withdrawal.  We'd see any of those things.  Sometimes we've been able to treat people with it, start it, get some results, and then discontinue it.  The, their, the studies weren't really done, they were, you know, they were, short studies where they showed that it worked.  So that, kind of the duration of treatment is not, perhaps, scientifically based at this point.  We don't have a lot of great research for how long, but we do have some history in the past, when we added in things to augment or try to make medicines more effective for people where we, um, added them in for a few months.  People got response.  We were able to stop them and sustain benefit, and, and, so, I think that we can kind of, we first got to get you responding well, make sure you tolerate it, but we can kind of take the duration of treatment from visit to visit with it, because -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I think we can help.  The, the reason why in part I asked, in terms of where you're at in terms of your prescription coverage is, I, I may have some samples to get you started on it, I may not.  Um, it's an expensive medicine, but if your plan isn't charging you copayments and, and, they may ask us to authorize it, but you've tried and taken some other medicine such that, we probably shouldn't have any problem getting their permission to do it if they require a preauthorization for it.  They just will have, want to know that you've tried something other than, um, just having this be the first -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Medicine we've gone to, just because of the cost of it.  But, um, and, and we'll continue with the Cymbalta without any change -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> In terms of that.  So, now my thought would be then to see you back probably in, in about a month then, with those kind of changes, [PATIENT NAME], just make sure that we've got -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, that we've got things working.  People in the study, they found that they could get some benefit, even in the first week or 2 with it.  So, this is, again, is one of those situations where we can see some progressive benefit over the course of probably the next even 4 to 8 weeks, but I don't expect you have to wait that long.  And, again, our, my personal experience with it has been when people have taken it, they've, they've actually, I've had a lot of people that really have felt quite well even in the first week, which has been nice -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Because we don't, we don't often have medicines that have, um, are that, quite that good out of the gate.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Maybe I'll clean my house.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Well, but, you know, and, and truly, you know, the, the last time, um, I had someone with that good of a response was right before the Christmas holidays and the lady was really lamenting that she hadn't really done a lot and gotten the things done the way she hadn't and when I saw her back, she got it together within that week before.  So, perhaps.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Are there any questions about it, though?  Or, a, any concerns at all with that?  I, I don't think it's our only option, I just think that it's a good option for you.
<b>PT:</b> No.  I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, why don't we, let me go get some samples of things, and see if we can't get you some samples to get started on it.  And, um, but otherwise, we'll get you a prescription, and we'll get things set up to see you in a month.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  And I need a prescription for my Ambien.
<b>DR:</b> Ambien, too.  Yep, yep.  I will do so.
