BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	So you said?
<b>PT:</b>	I was supposed to start Monday, so I thought, so I went down, they said, "Oh, [PATIENT NAME], we're sorry you came down, you know, your paperwork isn't through yet."
<b>DR:</b>	Is it a volunteer position?
<b>PT:</b>	No, it's a paid, it's only $12 an hour, but it's better than nothing.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  Working with kids?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, working with kids.  It's called [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What does that involve?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, well, I'm not too clear.  I mean, I have a job description, but what, I went over to another [DEIDENTIFIED], um, yesterday, not yesterday, Monday when I was down there, when I reported to work, and they told me to go, I went over to [DEIDENTIFIED] which is [DEIDENTIFIED].  They have a [DEIDENTIFIED].  But theirs is tremendously, tremendously large.  Mine's like a cubbyhole.  But, um—
<b>DR:</b>	So is it like kind of a after school program for kids that are part of Salvation Army?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm going to do, um, no, not exactly.  Well, yes and no.  They try not to call it a daycare, but actually what we are is a really glorified, you know, babysitter, but a part of that you have to do more than just babysitting.  You know, um, you have to get the parents to interact with their children in the [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	How old are the kids?
<b>PT:</b>	From 6 to 6, 6 months to 6.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, so it's young, young, it's like toddlers.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  Now only the 6 months can come in if they've gotten permission like for me, because they have to, um, have a reason.  They don't want, actually they don't want to use it as a daycare.  They want them to, um, get permission to bring the children, like to have an appointment.  They have to sign papers and have the case manager sign and return it to me.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So it's not really going to be, the object of the [DEIDENTIFIED] is for the parents and the child to interact in a positive manner and each to learn skills.  Mother parenting skills, child to learn—
<b>DR:</b>	Do the parents have an educational component to it?
<b>PT:</b>	Huh?
<b>DR:</b>	Do the parents have an educational component to it?
<b>PT:</b>	I have no clue.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Well—
<b>DR:</b>	It sounds interesting.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I think what I'm supposed to do is observe and, um, report to the social worker any interaction that I see that's not appropriate that the mother would have to work on.  And then she in turn would probably tell—
<b>DR:</b>	They work on it, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, the case manager or—
<b>DR:</b>	So these families that are in the Salvation Army services like?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Like that are in—
<b>PT:</b>	They're all homeless.
<b>DR:</b>	Homeless, right, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	They're all homeless, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's really, wow, that's, sounds like a great program.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it is.
<b>DR:</b>	But it sounds similar to some of the ones you've been part of with the city too, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, no, not as intensive because I was not in a situation every day where I was with children or the mothers.  When I drove, I was, but that was only in terms of putting in the bus and taking them out, and listening to them.  So I did interact with them.
<b>DR:</b>	But your agency that you had worked with had dealt with homeless people.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, that's what we do.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] Salvation Army, so I can't be paid out of city funds because I was in the job program.  So I'm being paid through [DEIDENTIFIED] or some funding that they received to keep the [DEIDENTIFIED] open because they have to pay people to manage it and then the other part of it is for me to get, um, donations, uh, from wherever I think I can get them for the children.  To re—create a resource library, if I see that I think the parent is [INAUDIBLE] with something to create a resource library of information that they could go to and read or listen to, whichever it happens to be.  So [NAME OTHER], the head of it, um, is not going to be in next week, but her art therapist who I not kindly friendly to, um, is going to be in charge.  So I have to report to her, [NAME OTHER].  She called me granny three times in the interview.  Three times she called me granny.  I don't know whether she was just testing me to see if I would get ruffled or whatever, but, yeah, because of my hair.  She called me, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I can see that, although you like it?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I'm thinking of dying it again.  Everybody, a couple of people have called me granny.  But most of my friends like it because they say it's pretty.  It's a pretty color, so.
<b>DR:</b>	It's different for you, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it is different.  So I'm thinking, I am thinking of dying it again when I get around to it.
<b>DR:</b>	Whenever you, whatever makes you happy with that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, I'm not sure.  Some days I like it and other days I'm like, mm, maybe I should dye it, if another person calls me granny I'm going to pop them, you know, so, um, so that's what that is about.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're officially retired.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Congratulations.
<b>PT:</b>	Thank you, thank you.  None of my money has come yet, so I'm living on fumes.  In fact, yesterday I was out with my nemesis [NAME OTHER], believe it or not, and, uh, I think we're trying to be just, you know, friends, just friends.  She's, um, moving to Jersey so, um, but, um, what was I going to say.
<b>DR:</b>	You went out with her.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it never ends well.  It never, she deliberately picks on things.  Yesterday it was my hair.  My hair smell.  I said, "Boy, you haven't said that one in a very long time," which she hasn't.  She used to use that a long time ago.  I guess I looked, maybe I looked disheveled yesterday, you know.  So, yeah, it's always something.  Something she picks up.  It always starts on the way back, like if we have a decent time or whatever, it always starts on the way home.  At some point on the way home she starts.
<b>DR:</b>	So what did you do?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I just, I said that, I said, "You haven't said that one in a long time."  And so I said, and she says, "Oh, a long time?"  And she said, "Well, something smells."  Of course she hasn't, she had played tennis and hadn't taken a shower either, but it couldn't be that it was her, but I didn't think that at the time.  I was just, I didn't think that until I got out of the car.
<b>DR:</b>	So you were out playing tennis?
<b>PT:</b>	She was.  I didn't play tennis.  I went up to meet her for breakfast.  I wanted to eat.  And then she told me I was out of control with my money, which I have really been pretty good lately because I don't have any money to spend.
<b>DR:</b>	So out of control, what did she mean?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, that I only have $8 left to my name.  I have exactly I think $8 left to my name until my money from the city comes.  So that's what she said.
<b>DR:</b>	But when you retired is there a pension as well?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, I get a pension.  And I have a lump sum.
<b>DR:</b>	So the lump sum is what's coming in March?
<b>PT:</b>	No my pension's coming in March.  The lump sum will go directly to [INAUDIBLE].  It's not coming to me.  It can't come to me because it has to be rolled over.  It's a large amount of money.  And that, I put it in [DEIDENTIFIED] so maybe it'll grow a little bit.  And I'll have something.  I've never been good with money and, um, that's about, that's kind of like a nest egg that if I hadn't retired and gotten that approven, it wouldn't have been there.  So I've never, ever, I kind of like traded one addiction for the other, but, uh, I think even if I continue both of them I would have been, you know, but whatever.  I'm really going to try to rectify.  This money comes from the city, um, it's enough to, it's not a great amount either, but, um, that's why I have to work, but when I hit Social Security in [DEIDENTIFIED] years or if I take Social Security early, I'll be okay.  I'll be making as much as I was when I was working with less bills, you know, because I'm paying off, I get vacation money and sick time, I get 60 days' sick time.  That's a lot of money.  So with that I'm paying off all my bills, as many as I can without hurting the fact that I still, I need a door, front door, I need brick laying, and I need a garage.  You know, I'm going to pay as much as I can without touching the money that needs to go for that.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.  Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	So, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it sounds like you're planning things much better.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm really trying to, you know.  I slip sometimes and I go, I do go out of control, but I've been trying [INAUDIBLE] money.
<b>DR:</b>	Out of control.
<b>PT:</b>	I love to spend money.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I remember—
<b>PT:</b>	And if I really realized where money went I would probably cry every day because I've blown money all my life.  I could be a multimillionaire.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I remember when you, uh, I think when you and I first met in the hospital ages ago, there was a issue with [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	A little gambling back then.  But that hasn't been an issue now?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I've been pretty—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it sounds like in the grand scheme of things you have a good plan in place.  And part of it's just following through with it and being diligent with it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, I have to really, well, she wants to do my money again just not my money but big money.  But the money that comes to 60 days, she has asked me if I wanted to do it, and of course in order to please her I said yes which was stupid.  I should have just said no, I can manage it myself.  I'm an adult.  You know, but, um, she's never pleased with whatever choices I make.  You know, it was, um, I wanted to buy soy milk yesterday, well, why do you want to buy soy milk?  You know, what's wrong with 2% milk?  You know, I, you don't live with me, you know.  That was one thing, you know.  She saw me, at [DEIDENTIFIED] we split, you know, walking around and then, uh, and then she don't want me to get the TV that I want.  I want a 40 inch TV.  She wants me to get a 27 inch.  Well, I want a 40 inch but it's a lot of money.  But everything else will be taken care of and then, with or without her I'm going to get my TV.  That's my retirement gift to me.  I want a 40 inch TV.  It can be 37 or 32, but I don't want a 27 inch one.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I really want a 40.  I kind of like, like my friend, [NAME OTHER], he, um, he has a 32 inch one, but it seems small in comparison to the 40 inch.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, sure.
<b>PT:</b>	So I think I really want just the, I don't want a 60, I don't want a 52, a 40 or I'll accept a 37, but that's what I want.  You know, but she don't want me to put all the money out because apparently, I don't know whether she has plans for my money or what the story is.  I don't know if she wants me to travel or, but who knows with her.  You never know because she doesn't talk to me or tell me things that I really need to know to function in relationship to her.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's kind of strange that—
<b>PT:</b>	It's been the same thing for 20 years.
<b>DR:</b>	But then you give her such responsibility though.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.  I know, it's like she's my mother.  Like I can't say no.  I can't say no to her for some reason, I can't say no to her.  I do give her a lot of responsibility over me.  So when I'm away from her I do what I want to do.  I go out with other people, you know.  We never, yesterday was a fluke.  I don't know what her problem was.  I don't know why she wanted to go out yesterday.  I don't know what she really wants.
<b>DR:</b>	Her circumstance, I mean, she's still, she's married, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's retired, got buku money.  She's not hurting for money, you know, but she's very good with money.  You know, and, um, yeah, she's married, so that's another thing.  She, you know, I just, um, I don't know.  Sometimes I think I really do, I do love her, you know, and, um.  I don't know, I just can't make decisions.  I can't make decisions and just leave.
<b>DR:</b>	You mean just not associate with her, you mean?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  When she calls I run.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean there's different levels though too.  I mean, it's one thing to say no, you're not going to talk to her, not return phone calls, whatever, I don't know if you have to do that, but, you know, if she is taking over certain responsibilities for you too, I mean, there's different levels of, um, connection.  And if she's managing your finances or telling you whether to buy soy milk or not, I mean, there seems to be a little, um, over—connection.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, there is, but we never connect to say what that over—connection is.  We never go beyond that other than I let her control me when she, but she's like that really with everybody.  It's not, and the more I see her with other people which is good for me, the more I see that I've taken a lot of who she is as personal and it shouldn't have been.  You know, I'm seeing a little more than she—
<b>DR:</b>	That she's controlling with everybody, it's not just with you.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, more so maybe with the people she feels close to, you know, but, um—
<b>DR:</b>	But it's not something to misinterpret as, you know, a deeper kind of relationship?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know what she feels to be honest with you.  I have no honest clue.  I have no clue.  She would be amazed at, you know, she either really truly hates my guts which she acts like sometimes or she really loves me.  I don't know which is true.  I really don't, I don't know.  She's never said or she's never, never, um, but I know something's, um, that I know that I shouldn't do like the other night I called her to tell her that the ski club meeting was.  Well, I couldn't get there.  My, I said, I'm going from [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, I'm working for this lady part time which is kept me afloat a little bit, so, um, so I said I'm leaving from [DEIDENTIFIED] but when it came time to go, leave for [DEIDENTIFIED] I forget what happened, but I came home.  I figured, you know, what the heck, it doesn't matter whether I go or not.  If she wanted to go, she goes to [DEIDENTIFIED] and [NAME OTHER] will be there.  And I didn't call her to let her know I wasn't coming.  I should have called her to tell her.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	I should have told her I wasn't coming, but I didn't.  And I knew that, but for some reason I deliberately didn't call her.  I don't know why.  And then the next day she gave me a video, um, and I didn't know it was empty, so I had left it in my car two days and then the next day I was going to watch it.  I brought it in, hooking it up, no video.
<b>DR:</b>	Just the case?
<b>PT:</b>	Just the case.  So I assumed that, uh, someone had stolen it out of my car, or I let myself assume that.  I just didn't want to call her to tell her that it was, the truth, bottom line is that I really didn't want to call her and tell her it was not in there.  And I thought maybe if somebody stole it, you know, I'm just going to take care of it myself.  So I went to Blockbuster's.  I took, I brought it back, I paid for it, and then half an hour later she rings the phone, she says you take care of the video?  I said, yeah, I took care of it.  How did you take care of it, I have it here.  So and again I should have called her, I should have more faith, more trust and have called her.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, sure.  But she caught you.
<b>PT:</b>	But I didn't.  I didn't have the faith that she would have a hissy fit, which she did anyway.  So in ways I act up her like she's a, like I'm a child to her.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and I'm never sure which is the appropriate response because she yells all the time.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, it sounds like she's going to yell either way.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So being up front and being honest.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Not trying to hide anything, you know, in terms of like a video.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, or don't set yourself up.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, because I swear that she knew that thing was empty and wanted to see what I was going to do.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe.
<b>PT:</b>	So I think that's, I think it was empty and she knew it was empty and wanted to know what I was going to do.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe, that's not out of the realm of possibility, but—
<b>PT:</b>	So, other than that I'm fine.
<b>DR:</b>	How are you doing with the Abilify?
<b>PT:</b>	Abilify.  Not real good, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Are you taking it?
<b>PT:</b>	Sort of.
<b>DR:</b>	Sort of, how often?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, not too often.
<b>DR:</b>	Twice a week, ever?
<b>PT:</b>	Ever, sometimes never.  Sometimes, I started taking it and then I stopped again.  There was an article in the paper about it, did you see that?
<b>DR:</b>	Which one?
<b>PT:</b>	In the, um, about Abilify and, uh, um, it was in the business section of, um, last Sunday's paper.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I meant to save it for you.
<b>DR:</b>	What'd it say?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, it was saying, it mentioned Abilify and others and it was saying that, um, uh, they're being overused or there could be problems with them and—
<b>DR:</b>	Um, there have been some articles about off—label use of those medications with older adults like people with dementia, 'cause it doesn't have an indication for people that have Alzheimer's that have paranoia or behavioral problems.  It's not supposed to be used in that group, but it's used a lot in that group.  So when some article is about that.
<b>PT:</b>	It might have been about that.
<b>DR:</b>	But not, I think for the most part, you know, its indications are for psychosis, paranoia, <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> with bipolar.  And then also with bipolar depression now and bipolar mania.  So it's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, I'll be good.
<b>DR:</b>	And you're not on the high dose, you're on 10 mg.  I mean, every once in a while, if you take it consistently, like if you took it for a few months in a row regularly, then we might want to make sure that like at least annually that you get liver enzymes and a blood sugar test.  But, you know, you've been on and off of medications like this for a while without too much problem.  But so far, at least the last 6 months or so, it hasn't been, you haven't been consistent with it.  Yeah.  Forgetting to take it or having—
<b>PT:</b>	I try to, I bought a thing actually to keep in my, uh, on my key ring and then that's broken.  It fell away.  So, uh, I, you said take it around five o'clock, so I'm going to try to, you know, uh, get another one and keep it on my keychain and keep them in my, so wherever I am I can just, you know, take it around, five, five, six o'clock.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you have any at home right now?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you do have some, okay.  Well, then, you don't need a sample package to make sure you get started tonight.  Just a little reminder for yourself, dinnertime tonight?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Take one.
<b>PT:</b>	Take one, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean, although I think in the grand, I mean, even if you're just being, you're not doing horribly right now, although I think it would help.  I think it would help with the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I'm doing halfway decent, but I think, uh, I, whenever something's missing I'm horribly, horribly paranoid that someone has taken it.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I think it's going to help with the paranoia, but I also think it's going to help you organize your thoughts, like be able to stay focused and organized, 'cause I think that's one of the things is when you get overwhelmed I think everything goes in a lot of different directions if you know what I mean.  So I think it's going to help.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't even put socks on, I just can't, put my shoes on.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, we gave you the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I just—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, let's get you another visit here.
<b>PT:</b>	And I might have to send you a form to fill out so that I can, um, I have a plan where I can get the medicine, I mean I'll still come in, but I can get the medicine.
<b>DR:</b>	Three months?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So you say eight o'clock on a [DEIDENTIFIED] morning is better?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	'Cause we could do eighty thirty if you think that'll get you here.
<b>PT:</b>	That's fine.  Eight thirty's fine.
<b>DR:</b>	Eight thirty [DATE].
<b>PT:</b>	Eight thirty's good 'cause I don't have to be at work until eleven on [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED].  So I could just leave right from here.  You know, get down and mess around.
<b>DR:</b>	Sounds good.  Thanks for doing this again.
