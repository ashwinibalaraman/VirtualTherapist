<font size="4"><b>Chapter 12: Melancholia: Depression</b></font>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>


The shadow that melancholia casts on the mental life
of any human being is the oldest concept of psychopathology
that is still as current in modern thought as
it was at any time in the past. The feelings that characterize
this experience are typically sorrow, fear, and
hopelessness. Because of its outward manifestations it
is quite easily recognizable by observers. The specific
causes of melancholia are as debatable today as they
were three millenia ago.


In the fourth century B.C., Hippocrates, known as
"the father of medicine," wrote a treatise on melancholia.
He taught that health and disease were governed
by the balance between the humors or juices of
the body. To each humor there corresponded a particular
temperament; for example, the "melancholic"
temperament and melancholia were ascribed to the primacy
of black bile in the body (<i>melancholia</i> = black
bile, Greek.) Another of the basic humors of the body,
blood, was reflected in the sanguine temperament, a
notion that gave rise to the medical treatment of
<i>bleeding</i> as a method to counteract disease. For more

In 1621 Robert Burton first published his classical book, <i>The
Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, which constituted a survey and critical evaluation
of almost everything that had been written about melancholia in the
western world since the days of Hippocrates. Burton considered melancholia
to be the most universal of human afflictions, holding that there is
no person who does not, at some time or other experience it, to some
degree, in one or another of its changeable forms. He noted that many
authorities had limited the true nature of melancholia to one consisting
of fear and sorrow, which were assumed to be inseparable companions
in forming the common basis of all depressions. In spite of this authoritative
limitation, Burton reviewed not only these two more familiar
emotions, but a multitude of other symptoms as well.


The four and twenty letters make no more variety of words in divers
languages, than melancholy conceits produce diversity of symptoms in several
persons. They are irregular, obscure, various, so infinite, Proteus himself is not
so diverse ... as a true character of a melancholy man ... Who can distinguish
these melancholy symptoms so intermixt with others, or apply them to
their several kinds, confine them into method? "Tis hard, I confess; yet I have
disposed of them as I could, and will descend to particularize them according
to their species.... Not that they are all to be found in one man ... but
some in one, some in another, and that successively or at several times.
(Burton, 1927, pp. 347-348)


Burton's statement remains valid. The descriptions and analyses of
the experience of melancholia that I will present are quite diverse in
nature and rather difficult to organize in a systematic fashion.


<i>The Nature of Melancholia</i>


The state of melancholia is not a simple emotional experience or
intellectual disturbance. Different persons use a variety of terms to describe
their experience. Traditionally, the feeling is said to be a mixture
of sorrow, hopelessness, and fear, including a train of other similarly unpleasant
and distressing feelings. On the physical side, insomnia, weariness,
tension, weepings and sighing are frequent external symptoms.
Hallucinations are rare. Delusions regarding other people seldom occur
but delusions concerning one's own person are commonplace. Thoughts
of suicide and suicidal attempts (often successful) are frequent. Because
of this complexity of feelings and manifestations, it is not possible to
summarize in a series of citations the entire range of melancholic complaints.

[p. <i>262</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00278&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If I were asked to characterise in the briefest possible way, the whole
experience of the depressive phase, I would describe it as a total reaction of
repulsion between those fundamental poles of all being as we perceive it,
which can be roughly and variously designated as the individual and the
environment, the "I" and the "Not I," the ego and "the other," the perceiver
and the perceived (including inner perceptions), or even as the soul and God.
The basis of that repulsion seems to be fear, or "anxiety," to use the word
generally employed to translate the Freudian concept of "Angst." And in the
last analysis, as I have tried to show, the fear or anxiety seems to resolve
itself at the climax into the fear of physical pain in the most terrifying form.


There is something quite logical about this.... Certainly it seems to me
that my reactions in the depressive phase are crude ... or "total"... There
is little or no discrimination; everything is abhorrent to me, everything repels
me, everything frightens me. My consciousness has as it were regressed to
that earliest stage of the simple organism which, finding its environment unpleasant,
wants to get away at all costs. I want to get away into the nothingness
of annihilation, hence my suicidal impulses. Yet the unpleasantness of my
situation thrusts itself upon my consciousness with all the intensity and with
all the endless variety and refinement of torture made possible with the vast
and intricate development of the nervous system in man. Infinite possibilities of
horror and pain occur to me. If I have the slightest pain, that pain becomes in
anticipation infinite and increasing, absorbing my whole consciousness. Every
unpleasant reaction or thought is magnified to the limit....


The sense of sin ... in depression is dominating and all pervading....
It can reach incredible extremes ... As far as I can analyse it, the sense of sin
... was dominated by two factors. The first factor was a tremendous sense
of repulsion ... [and] guilt.... The second factor was an overwhelming
sense of sexual sin. (Custance, 1952, pp. 76-77; 79)


<i>Onset of Melancholia</i>


The following may be considered as one of the typical modes of
onset of a depression. It was described by the nurse whom I have already
quoted in Chapters 3 and 4.


I was seized with an unspeakable physical weariness. There was a tired
feeling in the muscles unlike anything I had ever experienced. A peculiar
sensation appeared to travel up my spine to my brain. I had an indescribable
nervous feeling. My nerves seemed like live wires charged with electricity. My
nights were sleepless. I lay with dry, staring eyes gazing into space. I had a
fear that some terrible calamity was about to happen. I grew afraid to be
left alone. The most trivial duty became a formidable task. Finally mental
and physical exercises became impossible; the tired muscles refused to respond,
my "thinking apparatus" refused to work, ambition was gone. My general

[p. <i>263</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00279&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It will be recalled that the writer of this excerpt had been a charge-nurse
in a general hospital. The onset of the depression was rapid, and
her loss of self-control, together with the realization of her own insanity,
took only a few days to develop. The fatigue and inner tension led to an
agitated state, which made her admission to a mental hospital imperative.
In a matter of weeks, she passed from the agitated depression into a
maniacal state. As she recorded her account of this episode, it is apparent
that her first symptoms were undue weariness, tension, and insomnia,
leading to an apprehensive fear and mental confusion which eventually
culminated in strong feelings of hopelessness and futility.


In <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, James included a chapter
on "The Sick Soul" which deals largely with the phenomena of melancholia.
He cites the following quotation from a manuscript that had come
into his possession.


Whilst in this state of philosophic pessimism and general depression of
spirits about my prospects, I went one evening into a dressing-room in the
twilight to procure some article that was there; when suddenly there fell upon
me without any warning, just as if it came out of the darkness, a horrible fear
of my own existence. Simultaneously there arose in my mind the image of an
epileptic patient whom I had seen in the asylum, a black-haired youth with
greenish skin, entirely idiotic, who used to sit all day on one of the benches,
or rather shelves against the wall, with his knees drawn up against his chin,
and the coarse gray undershirt, which was his own garment, drawn over them
inclosing his entire figure.... <i>That shape am I</i>, I felt, potentially. Nothing
that I possess can defend me against that fate, if the hour for it should strike
for me as it struck for him. There was such a horror of him, and such a
perception of my own merely momentary discrepancy from him, that it was
as if something hitherto solid within my breast gave way entirely, and I became
a mass of quivering fear. After this the universe was changed for me altogether.
I awoke morning after morning with a horrible dread at the pit of my
stomach, and with a sense of insecurity of life.... I remember wondering how
other people could live, how I myself had ever lived, so unconscious of that pit
of insecurity beneath the surface of life.... I mean that the fear was so
invasive that had I not clung to scripture-texts ... I think I should have
grown really insane. (James, 1902, pp. 160-161)


Again the fearful feeling of insecurity and hopelessness with the
attendant horror and sorrow took hold of his sick soul and, as he said,
"fell upon me without warning." This man thought that he had saved
himself from true insanity by mentally clinging to scriptural texts, a
common defensive device but one that has failed many another person
who has been similarly overwhelmed by fear.


Not all depressions start as suddenly as those I have depicted. For

[p. <i>264</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00280&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Major Varieties of Depression</i>


From the collection of autobiographical accounts of melancholia or
acute depression I have assembled, it seemed to me that four major
classifications may be used to characterize the material. It is possible that
the emotional core is quite similar in all varieties of melancholic experiences,
yet I have found it emphasized differently, as a function of the
status or other problems of the individual; hence, accounts written by
(1) religious mystics; (2) passive, depressed, psychotic patients; (3) the
patients who suffer from an agitated depression; and (4) the more fragmented
or schizoid patients; all four types seemingly present the same
core of melancholia, but each type appears in some way in a different
light.


<b>MYSTICAL OR "SICK-SOUL" EXPERIENCE</b>


The reports given by mystics emphasize sin, evil, and the like; there
is usually not much reference to physical conditions or complaints. The
intrusion of religious experience into psychopathology may be illustrated
by portions from a journal kept by a middle-aged man under the
pseudonym "Nicodemus," whose private mental world figuratively collapsed
at the same time as the military collapse of France early in World
War II.


I am lost; I am damned; I am dead; only Thou, O Christ, can quicken
these dead bones. I am a crawling mass of corruption; every thought, every
act, every wish, every willing of mine is corrupt--I can do no good thing.
Even this contrition, this horror of myself is rotten with sin and self-will. Slay
me O God, and remake me! I pray for no less than that. And, in an hour, even
that blinding knowledge will be lost to me and I shall slide back into the foulness,
the pettiness, the futility of self. Except Thou save--except Thy fire shall
not abate, shall consume me utterly, purge me thoroughly. O God, take not
Thy fire from my soul! Save me from the hell of indifference and compromise!
Save me--and I shall be saved. Heal me and I shall be healed. There is no other
saving; I cannot save myself....


I know too, as matter of cool self-observation, that this that has happened
to me, is no "neurosis." There is no phrase which fits it more nearly
than the old phrase which has seemed so often so hollow, of "the hand of God."

[p. <i>265</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00281&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That is as nearly as I can tell this state in words. And it is now constantly
at call. Anxieties, annoyances, the hate and horror which are the burden
of all news now, are no more than, as it were, winds ruffling the surface of a
fathomless and illimitable sea. The intolerable tension, the sense of doom, the
contrition which rent the soul asunder--all these have passed. It is a state
which I have never known save in moments and is, I know, foreign to my
natural temperament and one which I neither conjure up myself nor could
conjure. (Nicodemus, 1942, pp. 66; 67; 128)


This melancholic experience is that which has been characterized
as part of the mystical experience of the "sick soul," which he maintained
stemmed largely from a sense of sin. But note that the sufferer wrote,
"This has come <i>to</i> me, not <i>from</i> me." As is so often true, the individual
who recounts his pathological experience will state that the disturbance
came upon him from the outside. Indeed, in most instances of psychopathological
experience, the sufferer finds himself in a world of experience
that he never conjured or imagined, and that he never conceives as
having arisen from within.


The evangelist John Bunyan wrote the following paragraph on his
feelings of unworthiness in his <i>Grace Abounding in the Chief of Sinners</i>
(I quote from James). Bunyan was a sensitive person continually concerned
with the flow of his spiritual vitality.


But my original and inward pollution, that was my plague and my
affliction. By reason of that, I was more loathsome in my own eyes than was a
toad; and I thought I was so in God's eyes too. Sin and corruption, I said, would
as naturally bubble out of my heart as water would bubble out of a fountain.
I could have changed heart with anybody. I thought none but the Devil himself
could equal me for inward wickedness and pollution of mind. Sure, thought I,
I am forsaken of God; and thus I continued a long while, even for some
years together. (James, 1902, p. 158)


The essence of Bunyan's melancholia James termed "the vanity of
mortal things," referring to the concern the sufferer feels for the state of
his own soul.


A certain peculiar mental state has been repeatedly mentioned by
several devout followers of mystical practices who hoped to achieve true
ecstasy by long devotional exercises and meditations. It is described as a
condition that is gradually reached, in which they would find themselves
in a state of sorrow likened to the darkness of night, and during which
they experience a certain "dryness of the soul." As an example, the description
of such a state as related by Madame Guyon may be given here.


Loaded with miseries of all sorts, weighed down with the burden of
continual crosses, I at last gave up hope. The darkness of an eternal night
settled upon my soul. Looking upon myself as a victim doomed for destruction,

[p. <i>266</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00282&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Madame Guyon's depression continued throughout several years of
her life. It lifted suddenly with a feeling of revelation, grace, and ecstasy,
and she regained an inner assurance that God's salvation had been given
to her. The sorrowful feeling of the loss of self-esteem without the mention
of fear seems central in this variety of mystical depression.


Other mystics have spoken of the lethargy and weariness of the soul
as leading features of the melancholic state. MacCurdy supplies the
following citations from the early Church Father, St. John of Damascus.


A sorrowfulness so weighing down the mind that there is no good it likes
to do. It has attached to it as its inseparable comrade a distress and weariness
of soul, and a sluggishness in all good works, which plunges the whole man
into lazy languor, and works in him constant bitterness. And out of this
vehement woe springs silence and a flagging of the voice, because the soul
is so absorbed and taken up with its own indolent dejection, that it has no
energy for utterance but is cramped and hampered and imprisoned in its own
confused bewilderment, and has not a word to say. (MacCurdy, 1925, p. 343)


To sum up the leading features of the melancholic experiences of
religiously inclined or mystical devotees, I may point out the following:
(1) loss of self-esteem, (2) sorrow, (3) a mental weariness and feeling of
inner tension, (4) inability to carry on with one's duties and obligations,
(5) feeling of being lost from God's goodness, (6) feeling of horror at
one's own unworthiness, and (7) hopeless despair and a sense of doom.
There is little mention of states of fear or thoughts of self-destruction.
There is no mention of divine punishment; rather, though God has somehow
withdrawn His Grace, there yet remains a steadfast feeling of an
abiding trust.


<b>PASSIVE DEPRESSION</b>


This type of melancholy is the one commonly experienced by
manic-depressive patients during the depressive phase of their illness.
For reasons not understood, this passive depression yields rapidly to
electric shock therapy in a very specific fashion. Patients suffering from
this affliction were formerly found quite commonly in mental hospitals,

[p. <i>267</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00283&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Custance's account of his depression was cited previously in this
chapter. He wrote further concerning this experience.


I seem shut into myself, withdrawn from real contact with the outer
world as also from contact with God; the sun does not really shine, the trees
and fields are not really green; I am shut in with my thoughts, always of a
depressing and melancholy nature....


This state is so exactly what is described by the mystics that I will give
two quotations.... "everything seemed to me full of faults; my charities, my
alms, my prayers, my penances; one and all they rose against me. Either by
you, O my God, or by myself, or by all creatures, I felt myself universally condemned."
... "All the favours ever granted me were swept out of my memory.
My mind was so greatly obscured that I stumbled from doubt to doubt, from
fear to fear. I believed myself so wicked that I regarded my sins as the cause
of all the evils, and all the wickedness that afflicted the world." ... [This is]
exactly what happens in my mind as depression progresses. [St. Theresa wrote]
... of her mind being "obscured." That is what is happening to my mind at the
very moment I am writing. Instead of the light of ineffable revelation I seem to
be in, perpetual fog and darkness. I cannot get my mind to work; instead of
associations "clicking into place" everything is an inextricable jumble; instead
of seeming to grasp a whole, it seems to remain tied to the actual consciousness
of the moment. The whole world of my thought is hopelessly divided into incomprehensible
watertight compartments. I could not feel more ignorant, undecided,
or inefficient. It is appallingly difficult to concentrate, and writing is
pain and grief to me. As for wickedness, although my mind has not reached
the stage of regarding myself as the most wicked person in the world and
responsible for all the sin and evil afflicting mankind, I know too well that it
can do so. That appalling self-centredness is the reverse of the delusions of
grandeur and power. It leads to the uttermost depths. (Custance, 1952, pp.
61-62)


In a depressed state such as that Custance has just described, there
is a loss of all the ordinary pleasures of existence; there is no sunshine,
no pleasure from music, salt loses its savor and flowers their perfume.
The patient becomes certain that he has been forever lost because of his
unforgivable sins. He fears his imagined inevitable doom, and frequently
voices his wish that death might put an end to his suffering.


William James included in <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>
a translation from a letter written by a patient in a French asylum that
details further the suffering of the passive melancholic patient.


I suffer too much in this hospital, both physically and morally. Besides
the burnings and the sleeplessness (for I no longer sleep since I am shut up

[p. <i>268</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00284&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

From this letter one may gain some understanding of the feeling
of evil, the hopelessness, the fear, the querulous, irritable temper, and
the mental confusion that mark a passive depression. The entire experience
is of a sense of sin and evil with a persistent inner frustration. The
passivity is both a result and a cause of the distress.


<b>AGITATED DEPRESSION</b>


Some melancholic patients are possessed, in addition to their fearful
sorrow, by a compulsive and restless agitation that drives them to
incessant activity (for example, walking and wailing) for long periods
of time. This variety of depression is not infrequently an outstanding
feature of involutional melancholia. The Reverend William Walford
described, in his autobiography, this aspect of his melancholia, which
marked the sixth decade of his life.


The agitation and restlessness that affected me were so great, that I was
unable to sit down, as the moment in which I attempted to do so brought an
increase of misery; and I was kept pacing up and down my parlour from the
time of getting up until going to bed. I was so intensely wearied by this incessant
going to and fro, as frequently to scream with anguish. In consequence
of this painful excitement, I seldom rose from my bed before noon, as I was
able to continue this posture without additional pain. As soon as I came down
stairs, I hastily swallowed my breakfast, standing, and then the endless movement
began. While my body was thus occupied, my mind was the seat of the
direst contemplations, revolving the past and the future, until sometimes,

[p. <i>269</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00285&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The condition of being driven to continual activity is, in a sense,
the vivid outward expression of inner tension. As noted in several of the
descriptions of melancholia given above, the patient complained of an
inner tension from which he could find no relief. The agitation usually
takes the form of an endless pacing the floor. Some patients also express
their oppressive tension by wringing the hands, continuous gesturing, or
plaintive crying.


In his autobiography, <i>A Mind Mislaid</i>, H. C. Brown relates how at
the age of 65, he found himself in a state of agitated suicidal depression.
He attributed this mental break to frustrations in his career. He recovered
after some three years of hospitalization. Since much of his account is
not relevant to his own experience, I have somewhat abridged his description
in the following.


I am utterly powerless to describe the abject terror which seized me when
I realized I was within the four walls of a madhouse.... I do not recall that
I was ever muddled in my thoughts, but I certainly suffered from a depressed
state of mind that was so severe as to make me utterly indifferent to muddles
or no muddles. In that state you seldom speak to any one, and then only to
snarl. A constant state of hostility would perhaps define the attitude....
I was perfectly aware at all times of everything that was going on around me
and do not recall a single moment when I was confused or didn't know what I
was doing. I do know that I was simply sick of living, that nothing interested
me....


Nevertheless, my frightful mental depression persisted. It was utterly
impossible for me to dispel the gloom.... The power to work, the will to
work, was temporarily gone ... life had lost its savor.... I just didn't want to
get well. I would much rather be dead.... This struggle to conquer fear was
a bitter one. To return to the world meant facing a terrible ordeal. Life just
couldn't be faced, that's all there was to it....


It was thoughts like these that produced agitation; that compelled me
to walk unceasingly and breathlessly all my waking hours.... I went at breakneck
speed, I would say five miles an hour would be a conservative estimate.
For two years ... not eight hours, but nearer twelve a day. If you are fond
of figures, you can multiply ... and you get a very respectable total of 43,-800
miles for my two years performance. (Brown, 1937, pp. 19; 74; 77; 78;
80; 82; 168-169)


Brown's estimate of the number of miles covered by his walks is
probably no exaggeration. As he has said, the progress of the agitated
patient is not a slow melancholic stroll, but a rapid dog-trot which continues
throughout the waking day and on into part of the night. One

[p. <i>270</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00286&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Most attacks of agitated depression occur during the involutional
period of life. However, such symptoms have also occurred before the
age of fifty. I may cite an example recorded by an anonymous patient
of a period of acute agitated melancholia that overtook him in his late
twenties.


The everlasting reflection of [my frustrated ambition in] its fiery form
inflamed my brain--every thought became agony, and I went mad. My spirit
was impaled upon the instrument on which it had so sinfully leant--hope fled,
and in her place reigned that sleep-hating demon despair. Agony-driven, I
hurried ceaselessly on through that room till every foot mark of my bruised
and blistered feet could be traced in blood and water upon the floor. Sleep,
that oil, that priceless balm for the weary soul, had entirely departed; and my
parched brain glowed like a furnace. Were any one to ask me how long I
travelled upon these bruised and bleeding feet--how long my glaring eyeballs
refused protection from lids that felt like fire, my answer would break his faith
in my veracity forever. (Anon., 1947, p. 17)


In this instance the agitation lasted only a few days, since as the
depression deepened he became more deluded and disoriented, finally
drifting into a stuporous state from which he eventually recovered.


The hopeless despair, the sense of sin and tearfulness are as prominent
in the mind of the agitated depressed patient as they are in the
mind of the mystic and the passive sufferer. Inner tension seems to be
present in the complaints of every variety of melancholia, but in the
agitated patient it is so strong that it breaks through all ordinary barriers
of inhibitions and becomes the most overt symptom.


<b>SCHIZOID OR FRAGMENTED DEPRESSION</b>


In some patients, usually schizophrenics, the depression may differ
somewhat from the varieties of melancholia considered so far. In these
schizoid cases the sadness seems to be a part of a larger emotional upheaval,
in which hostility, anger, and fear play a complex role. Schizoid
thinking usually becomes disconnected so that the coherent associations
which ordinarily exist among thought processes are missing or, at least,
are no longer apparent. For example, Hackett wrote as follows.


That night, the creeping tide of depression washed away the sand of
self-esteem. I was a fool to think I could win. There was no victory for such
as me. I was a crippled puppy running by the road, dust on a cathedral floor,
a blind Hon, for me there was no hope. Was there anyone at all? There was

[p. <i>271</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00287&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Other schizoid patients have emphasized the growing mental weakness
and the feeling of automaticity that seems to attach itself to all
their actions. This mechanical feeling seems to depend largely on a
gradual loss of finer shades of feeling. Fear and automatic, nonvolitional
action alone remain.


A certain patient treated by the renowned French psychiatrist Janet
phrased the experience as follows.


The further I go the more my mind weakens; the more complicated an
act the more I dread it. I stop before the least obstacle without knowing what
to do. My parents, who see me do something from time to time, are deceived
and think that I am really acting. What I appear to do is not done by me; it is
done mechanically, as if it were done by some one else who had control of
me. I prefer to do nothing at all, rather than feel within me these actions performed
by another, which are as if inspired or forced by some one, God or
devil. It is too sad not to do anything of oneself; it is too humiliating. I am
ashamed, too, afraid of being laughed at, and I prefer not to stir rather than
act so.... I but half feel things; I am in a world which I do not understand,
which does not exist, and which inspires me with a vague fear.... I can no
longer speak to living beings; in the first place I do not know whether they are
alive; and in the second I no longer belong to the same world with them; they
humiliate me when they speak to me; I am going to withdraw into a corner
where there is absolutely no one; I do not live, I cannot live, I do not wish
to live. (Janet, 1921, p. 11)


Both this and the excerpt just preceding bear the marks of melancholia,
but the experience reported in both cases is more that of a
secondary development which grew out of the person's self-realization
of mental disintegration.


<i>Other Common Features of Melancholia</i>


It is possible to pick out the more common complaints that accompany
the melancholic state. I have given examples of sorrow, hopelessness,
fear, guilt, lack of energy, horror, grief, repulsion, agitation, and
finally, despair, resulting from the loss of self-control. To these I should

<b>LASSITUDE</b>


A symptom from which many patients complain is inertia, lack of
energy, or an indolent lassitude. Reid's patient, who had several episodes
of depression, wrote as follows.


In recent years the depressions have appeared suddenly. One day I went
to town to do some shopping for a friend. I went to a grocery store to make
some purchases. It suddenly occurred to me that I could make these to much
better advantage at the market only a block away. Suddenly I realized that I
did not have sufficient energy to go to the market, and that another depression
was upon me. It was with the greatest difficulty that I ordered the goods, paid
for them and came home. At these times my brain feels paralyzed.... I have
the impulse to act, but it seems as if something shuts down and prohibits
action. (Reid, 1910, p. 619)


Several of the excerpts I have given earlier in this chapter have
mentioned the weariness of depression. The patient just cited said that
the lack of energy was the first and most obvious indication of the onset
of her depression; in other words, the physical lassitude preceded the
feelings of despair and hopelessness. In other instances, patients who
have had repeated periods of melancholia usually report a slowly mounting
lethargy as each of their attacks started.


<b>SELF-REPROACH</b>


As all of the excerpts indicate, the melancholic person is dominated
by fear, sorrow, and hopelessness, to which are added the experience of
mental confusion and a felt deficiency of available energy, the entire
complex constituting an ill-defined feeling of sinfulness and sloth. This
state is further aggravated by a confusion of intellectual processes, which
the patient vaguely recognizes as an inability to think, to remember, and
to make decisions. Many of these patients will gradually cease complaining
of their unbearable sorrow or depression and seldom utter
spontaneous complaints of any sort. When questioned, they speak slowly,
and with many sighs, of having sinned, of being eternally damned, and
of their inability to concentrate and remember.


James cited the following portion from <i>The Life and Journal of
the Rev. Henry Alline</i>, an eighteenth-century evangelist.


Everything I saw seemed to be a burden to me; the earth seemed accursed
for my sake: all trees, plants, rocks, hills, and vales seemed to be
dressed in mourning and groaning, under the weight of the curse, and everything
around me seemed to be conspiring my ruin. My sins seemed to be laid
open; so that I thought that every one I saw knew them, and sometimes I was

[p. <i>273</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00289&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a sense, this inner conviction of sin and unworthiness is a strange
mixture of feelings of self-reproach and self-importance. How could any
one mortal being cause the earth to be so accursed? The guilt-laden
sinner can conceive of no adequate and sufficient punishment for his
nameless crimes. One of Davidson's observations from his <i>Remembrances</i>
casts a special light on this point.


Few people know what a punishment a short period of real madness is, or
even a period of deep depression. We must each one of us, at his or her appointed
hour, stand alone, not in the middle of a crowd, before the judgmentseat
of Christ; and He requires truth in the inward parts. No saint could wish
for greater joy; no sinner could fear a more dread apocalypse. Even the most
blood thirsty conqueror and dissolute pagan would hesitate, if he knew that
his latter end meant an ever-lasting headache; and it is worse, far worse, than
that. (Davidson, 1912, p. 276)


The torturing punishment of self-reproach is, as many patients have
testified, so great that all regard for the welfare of any other person is of
little or no importance, as one's own soul must come to its own final
judgment.


<b>INSOMNIA AND DISTURBED SLEEP</b>


The feelings of guilt and the state of agitation are in part
strengthened by the difficulty in sleeping that the depressed patient often
has. Many melancholies suffer from insomnia, or when they do sleep their
sleep is broken by bad dreams and nightmares, so that they awaken in
the early morning hours filled with self-torturing thoughts from which
they find little relief, either by daybreak or the activities of the day.
Benson in his account, <i>Thy Rod and Thy Staff</i>, wrote of this aspect of
his depression in the following way.


The symptoms of a persistent sleeplessness, a perpetual dejection,
amounting at times to an intolerable mental anguish ... I used to wake, morning
by morning, in my pleasant room, and hear the drowsy twittering of birds
in the great plane-tree ... and wonder half-bewildered where I was; till the old
horror rushed back into the mind. (Benson, 1912, pp. 1; 3)


Sleeplessness and disturbed sleep constitute prominent complaints
in melancholia, particularly acute during the early phases of melancholic

<b>SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS</b>


Many depressed patients become quickly convinced that suicide
is the ultimate answer to their hopeless condition. They see no reason
for the prolongation of their present state of misery nor can they find
any reassurance in the conventional belief that life beyond the grave
can be better. The "logic" of this feature was brought out by Custance
in the following statement.


First of all, I had by now become quite convinced that I was finished for
good and all. There was no possible chance of my coming out of the Hospital
alive. In fact though not actually dead I was as good as dead. For some inscrutable
reason, perhaps because I had committed "the unforgivable sin" or
just because I was such an appalling sinner, the worst man who had ever existed,
I had been chosen to go alive through the portals of Hell, in an ordinary
English lunatic-asylum. Therefore it was obviously too late for repentance....
All this I kept to myself, of course; I did not argue with [the Anglican parson]
about it. Nor did I tell the doctors.... My wife, who visited me nobly at
least twice a week for the whole eleven months of my confinement, never could
understand the logic of this attitude. She was the only person to whom I dared
confide my horrors, and I tried hard to show my train of reasoning. Roughly it
was that I was a sort of opposite of Jesus Christ. Satan's job had been to
catch a man, get him to sell his soul to him completely and utterly, like Faust,
and then take him down alive into the pit. That was a sort of necessary
counterweight to the resurrection of Jesus and the elect. I was the man. But if I
could only kill myself, it might blow up the whole Universe, but at least I
would get out of eternal torture and achieve the oblivion and nothingness for
which my soul craved. I did in fact make three attempts at suicide, the most
serious of which was when I tore myself from my attendant and threw myself
in front of a car. (Custance, 1952, pp. 66-67)


Because of the persistent feelings of hopelessness and futility, most
depressed patients seriously consider suicide and a proportion of the
group actually do commit suicide. Indeed, in the past, most psychiatrists
regarded every depressed patient as a potential suicidal risk. The risk has
always been greater during the days or weeks of recovery; at that time
there is a decrease in lassitude with periodic recurrences of acute
melancholia.


<b>DISCUSSION</b>


Melancholia is the oldest concept still in common use for describing
a special and definite variety of pathological mental phenomena. Its
psychological nature and physical presence are well known and easily
recognized. The onset of melancholia or depression may be sudden or

[p. <i>275</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00291&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We have seen that there are at least four major groups among which
melancholic patients may be differentiated; the mystic, the passive, the
agitated, and the fragmented. This division is based in part on the
surrounding circumstances, but is principally derived from the course
and outcome of the illness. As far as the actual core of the inner experience
is concerned, there are probably little or no important differences
among these groups.


As Burton pointed out more than three hundred years ago, the
terms that have been used to characterize the melancholic experience
are practically infinite. In the autobiographical material I assembled it
seems that the more frequent complaints involve feelings of fear, sorrow,
and hopelessness, together with feelings of rejection and repulsion, lassitude
and weariness, unworthiness and guilt.


This material was not organized around such experiences as sadness,
hopelessness, feelings of unreality, retardation, and inadequacy, as they
are blended in varying proportions. I did not avail myself of such an
organization mainly because of the indefinite way in which such terms
have been used. For example, in everyday usage, <i>sadness</i> has a wide
variety of meanings. It may connote heaviness, lethargy, mournfulness,
or simply a lack of ability to respond. Likewise, the word <i>hope</i> implies
that at some time in the future one's present desires have a chance of
being fulfilled. <i>Hopelessness</i> implies that there is no belief or faith that
the future will bring the fulfillment of one's desires. To a large extent,
the hopes of mankind center around the continuation of childish wishes,
such as, "When I grow up, I'll be ..." Some of these hopes have been
achieved, others forgotten; still others have been quieted by religious
faith--"There will be a better world hereafter." The depressed patient
finds that he has lost his faith in both earthly and heavenly reward and
says, "I am a failure," "I'm eternally lost," "There is no hope."


Hopelessness carries with it a feeling of unreality. As the excerpts
in this chapter indicate, the depressed patient complains that food has
lost its taste, the world is clothed in mourning, his body feels lifeless and
wooden, and so forth. Intellectually, the melancholic person may know
very well that his environment has not changed. But his emotional relation
to the world has become different so that he feels unreal. He can no
longer maintain an interest in life or in the world around him. How can
he respond adequately when he feels there is no zest left inside him, and
that he is sodden with lethargy and overwhelmed by the conviction of
his own unworthiness? The feelings of sadness, hopelessness, unreality,
and unworthiness together result in a loss of faith, the faith that St. Paul

[p. <i>276</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00292&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I will return for a moment to the consideration of the more discriminable
elements that are blended in the experience of melancholia.
Various writers have pointed out that the process of depression closely
resembles what is called "an attack of conscience" in normal everyday
experience. During such an attack of conscience, there is a conviction of
having sinned, a feeling of lethargy and a fear of the hitherto not appreciated
consequences of some past act or thought. One suddenly
becomes poignantly aware of the possible consequences of the action,
idea, belief or whatever; in a word, some of one's personal ethical or
moral lapses become vividly present in the consciousness and expiation
seems highly desirable. Ordinarily, if the person has already recognized
his responsibility, he tries to modify his thoughts and behavior, so as to
expiate the sin or offense. The depressed patient has no conscious
knowledge of a moral lapse, of any real sin that might have been of
sufficient magnitude to justify the intensity of the depressive guilt feelings.
Hence the patient is, in a sense, justified in complaining of having
committed "the unpardonable sin," by which he means the unknown
sin. An unconscious and unknown sin can neither be condoned nor
expiated. Essentially, the patient is saying, "I don't know what I did,
but it certainly must have been immense and unforgivable; unknowingly,
I must have sold my soul to the Devil; anything I try to do can only
make it worse; I am afraid and horror-stricken; I may be going mad."
This is, to put it simply, the essence of the thought process that the
depressed patient follows when trying to explain to himself his innermost
feelings of guilt and melancholia. At this point, one is reminded
of Peters' observation I quoted in Chapter 11, on fear: that there is a
real difference between the fear of some outside object and the fear
which has no real object.


The experience of melancholia has, in the minds of many, come
to be thought of as an essential part of religion. Hence, the argument has
developed that depression expresses either a visitation or a withdrawal
of divinity, or is a signal of divine concern, either of approbation or of
retribution. Many thinkers believe melancholic persons are not really
insane, and that they are in need of moral and ethical guidance rather
than medical care.


This point was considered by James in <i>The Varieties of Religious
Experience</i>. Since James himself suffered one or more periods of depression,
his remarks, although he did not directly refer to himself, become
more significant.


The normal process of life contains moments as bad as any of those
which insane melancholy is filled with, moments in which radical evil gets its

[p. <i>277</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00293&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In other words, whether melancholia is pathological or not, the
experience exists and in no sense is it philosophically irrational. The
healthy-minded man must make a place in his rational philosophy
and religion for sorrow, pain, and death.


There remain several other considerations that must be borne in
mind when considering the psychology of melancholia. For example,
there is the undoubted fact that many patients have oscillated between
states of melancholic depression and mania. In the following chapter
I will present some descriptions written by persons who have lived
through manic episodes. To anticipate this material I may say that,
psychologically speaking, melancholia and mania are not exactly the
opposite sides of the same coin; that understanding something of the
psychology of depression does not necessarily enable one to predict the
psychology of mania, despite the connection between the two processes.


Another puzzling point arises from the behavior of agitated melancholic
patients. That the depressed person should feel inadequate, both
physically and mentally, seems to come in a natural sequence from the
inner tension and other handicaps which accompany the feelings of sadness
and hopelessness. But, if this be true, why do the same intense
sadness and hopelessness underlie the overwhelming compulsive agitation
and endless activity of some persons, which is in utter contrast to the
mute suffering of the passive patient?
