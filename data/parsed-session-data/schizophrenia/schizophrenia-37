IT was my first wedding anniversary and I was
celebrating by heading for a mental hospital to keep from
killing myself.


Fit celebration, I thought, for Laura Rhodes, poor little rich
girl, or rich little poor girl, whichever way you looked at it, who
had everything she wanted in life except what she really
wanted.


We drove through the gates of Lanier, Dr. Stewart and I. A
late afternoon June sun shone through the trees as we approached
what was to be my home for God only knew how long.
Gray stone buildings, green trees, red sunset, and true blue Dr.
Stewart, I thought, the man who always came to my rescue in
moments of despair, the man I both loved and hated, loved
because, like all doctors, he ended pain; hated because, like all
doctors, he ended pain by inflicting pain. He was taking me to
Lanier because he thought I could be helped there and I had
agreed to go, without dreaming of a nay, because there was no
one else to whom I could turn.


Dr. Stewart helped me from his car, we walked over to the
biggest of the gray buildings and he escorted me inside. There
he introduced me to a young doctor who was to "admit" me to
Lanier, one of the country's leading private psychiatric hospitals.


"Will you be all right, Laura?" Dr. Stewart sounded worried.


"Yes, Dr. Stewart, and thank you for all you've done." He had

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00011&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He patted me on the shoulder, said to the admitting doctor,
"Take care of her," and was gone.


I stood alone in an alien world, one that was supposed to
protect me, feeling desolate and deserted.


"Your name?" The admitting doctor had an uncaring, mechanical
voice that might just as well have asked, "Your number,
convict?" Hollow, hollow man.


"Laura Rhodes," I said tonelessly.


More questions. Then, "Who will be paying your hospital
bill?"


Who always pays? I thought. Who has always showered me
with fur coats and flowing negligees and college educations even
unto graduate work and singing lessons and a horse and reducing
exercises at fancy salons and trips abroad. Daddy, of course.
Daddy always takes care of the bills. Daddy has money to burn,
that green, golden stuff that buys everything.


"My father," I said quietly. "I think he can afford even
Lanier."


"His address?" The doctor gave no notice of my dig.


I told him the street and number of our home, seeing in a
flash the wide veranda on which I played as a child, the long
sidewalk leading to the front door, up which I slowly walked as
a dignified high school senior, the hedge over which one of my
college beaus leaped like an awkward gazelle as my parents,
inside, watching, made no effort to stifle their laughter. Him I
did not marry, much as I admired his bronzed, all-too-handsome
face and lanky body. He had been just a shade too arrogant, too
sure of himself with me.


"This is Miss Kent, the supervisor of nurses." The admitting
doctor's mechanical voice brought me back to Lanier. "She will
escort you to your hall."


Escort she did, this woman in white except for a dark blue

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Women's section? Then there must be a men's section, I
thought. She probably had reeled off this information on our
gallop across the grounds but I had missed it. I'd catch up with
its location another time.


Then we were standing in an entrance hall whose floor was
black and white tiles. Black and white, like life, I thought. Neat
little squares. Everything fits. Everything but Laura Rhodes.
She doesn't fit anywhere. That's why she's at Lanier, standing on
black and white squares.


There was a small settee against one wall and beside it a
round table at which sat a pretty, blond young woman, also in
white. She stood up as we approached and unlocked a screen
door on one side of the hall. It took a key to let me in and a key
to let me out. I was a prisoner, now, no matter what they called
me, patient, inmate, guest, client, customer. Prisoner! No bars,
but a key, nonetheless, and this made it prison.


Now there were two white-clad nurses (one without a dark
belt) to follow. We walked through a large room in which I was
surprised to see a television set, a record player, sprawling sofas
and comfortable upholstered chairs. Yes, and even a wall-to-wall
rug, maroon, covering the floor. This is a mental hospital? I
thought to myself. Not at all like the movies I have seen.


I was led down a hall and into a small room, which, I was
informed, was mine, all mine. I looked around in wonder. It
could have been a bedroom in any house with its yellow walls,
old-fashioned dresser, flowered chintz chair and comfortable
cherry bed. What, no chaise longue? I wanted to ask ironically,

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Getting down to grimmer business, I examined the one
window. It was large and divided into small panes. I grimaced,
inwardly admiring their efficiency, for it looked impossible to
thrust one's fist through such tiny areas of glass. They were well
prepared for the desperate and the lonely who could take
loneliness no longer, who wanted only to shed the anguish of
their loneliness by dying.


My first escort left with a brisk "Good-bye, Mrs. Rhodes," and
the student nurse said, "Our office is across the hall, Mrs.
Rhodes. If you want anything, just knock on the door."


As I stood thinking of what I might want--a chocolate fudge
sundae or a copy of <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i> which I
always meant to read, every word of it, when I had the
time--she also departed.


I wasn't alone for long. Another nurse, this one wearing a
blue and white uniform (who did all the designing, I wondered?)
slid into the room and said pleasantly, but firmly,
"Please remove all your clothes, Mrs. Rhodes." It sounds like a
line of poetry, the way she says it, I thought.


She handed me the hospital gown and robe that were draped
over the chair. She explained, in answer to my puzzled stare,
"You are going to take a bath. It's the next step in our admission
procedure."


Meekly I undressed, put on the shapeless, drab gray gown
and canvas slippers and pattered down the corridor after her
with a feeling of elegance in spite of my attire, for the corridor
was also carpeted wall-to-wall. My home outside of home outdid
the original, which had luxurious Persian rugs but not wall-to-wall.


We entered a large bathroom with four sinks and two stall-like
areas which contained man's first luxury in life-the toilet.
The student nurse pulled out a bunch of keys which hung from
a string beneath her apron, and unlocked a door. It opened to

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She said, "Mrs. Rhodes, if you will sit here, I shall run the
water for your bath," and indicated a straight wooden chair
next to the tub.


Rub-a-dub-dub, two women in a tub, I thought, as I sat down
and watched her bend over and turn on the water. Then I said
with dignity, wanting her to know I bathed every day, even the
days I entered mental hospitals, "I already had one bath before
I came here."


"I know, Mrs. Rhodes," she said apologetically, "but this is
part of the admission routine." She turned off the water and
faced me with a smile. "Are you ready?"


Ready for what? I thought. I am never ready to disrobe in
public. I had always been ashamed of my plump, ugly body, shy
about appearing naked in front of men, women or children. I
was embarrassed, although I did it, undressing in front of my
husband, even though he was a doctor and well acquainted with
the human body, interior and exterior.


Self-consciously, I took off the robe and placed it across the
chair. I climbed into the water.


"Is it warm enough for you, Mrs. Rhodes?" she asked disinterestedly,
as though I were just another doughnut on a tray
coming out of the oven.


"It's fine, thank you." I mustered all the graciousness of
which I was capable, the lady of the house (the crazy lady of the
mental institution) thanking her servant for running a tepid
bath.


I picked up the white washcloth, slowly coated it with soap
and thought about the student nurse's question. It did not
matter about the temperature of the water, I mused, for there
was barely enough of it in the tub to get my toes wet. Who was
kidding whom? I knew the bath was given so she could surreptitiously
examine my body for scars or other distinguishing marks
and to make sure I was not hiding a deadly weapon or lethal
drug. I washed my face slowly, closing my eyes behind the

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then I quickly lathered my body, thinking I would be a good
sport and go through the motions of cleaning off dirt that wasn't
there, rinsed off the soap and asked, "May I get out now?" I
thought she had ample time to make her observations and
discover there was no cocaine or Nembutal or knife hidden on
my naked frame.


When I was once more clad in the gown and robe, I followed
her into the main portion of the bathroom, door again locked
behind us, to the rows of sinks behind which a mirror reflected
both our images. She took a hairbrush out of her pocket and
started to brush my hair.


"I can do that," I said irritably, reaching for the brush. No
one had brushed my hair since the age of four, and I wasn't
about to let them begin.


"I know you can, Mrs. Rhodes," she said quietly. "I'll be
finished in a minute."


It occurred to me that perhaps she was examining my head
for lice or a possible scalp infection. I felt panic and indignation.
Did they think I was crazy <i>and</i> dirty?


"All right, Mrs. Rhodes. Shall we go back to your room now?"
she asked after a few strokes more.


What a stupid question, I thought. She could order me anywhere
she wanted, she didn't have to ask. I <i>had</i> to obey. I was a
robot now, a robot at Lanier. I had made a mistake in so easily
giving in to Dr. Stewart. I was really not that sick, after all. I was
not out of my mind. There was no reason why I should be kept
behind locked doors. I bit my lip to try to control sudden tears.


The nurse, seemingly unaware of my misgivings and panic,
led me back to the bedroom. She said, "The doctor will be here
after dinner to examine you," and left, carefully closing the
door behind her.


I plopped onto the chintz-covered chair, wanting to figure out
why I had allowed myself voluntarily to enter Lanier. I tried to

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wondered what time it was. I glanced down at my wrist,
then remembered the nurse, had taken watch and wedding
band. I stood up, went to the door, opened it and looked out. At
least I was not locked in the room. I peered down the hall, not a
soul was in sight. Nor was there a sound. I felt as if I had been
left completely alone in a haunted hospital. What if I should
need help, if a fire should break out or I became stricken with
appendicitis? My heart pounded with new panic.


I heard laughter from a room several doors away. I moved
toward the gay sound. Impulsively, I knocked on the door, seeking
a human voice, wanting only to know someone was near.


"It's open. Come in," a cheerful voice called out.


I walked into a room much like mine, except the chair was a
solid red. Three young women were sitting on a bed littered
with books. One of them looked up. She said, "Hello. I'm Sue.
You must be the new admission."


"Yes." I laughed uncomfortably, feeling like an intruder but
happy to be welcomed. "I'm Laura Rhodes. Mrs. Rhodes."


"Sit down and join us," she said.


I sat on the red chair. Sue pointed to the girl next to her, a
gangly girl with bright red hair and large blue eyes. "This is
Kimberly." The red-haired girl giggled as she looked at me in
acknowledgment of the introduction.


The third member of the trio was sprawled out amidst the
books on the bed. She wore a loose, white cotton nightgown
which half covered very full breasts, so big they looked incongruous
as part of her small, lithe figure.


"This is Elise," said Sue. Elise also had red hair but of a
strange shade that wavered between apricot and sand. Her eyes
were a vapid brown. She barely acknowledged the introduction,
turning to talk to Kimberly in a low voice. I felt I had interrupted

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Elise was saying, "He is a first-class son-of-a-bitch. All he does
is stare at you or his socks and puff away endlessly on cigarettes."


"Who is your psychiatrist going to be?" Kimberly asked me.


"I don't know," I said. "No one has told me yet."


"Probably Dr. Anders," she said. "He is the hall psychiatrist."
She giggled again, her giggle was like a tic, and continued,
"Wait till you see him! He usually wears white socks and stares
at his feet as you're talking."


The three of them looked at one another and laughed, as
though sharing a secret. I wondered what was so funny but was
afraid to ask and show my lack of understanding of the joke, so I
stared at a book on the dresser.


Kimberly stopped laughing. She said to me, "He's cute,
though. He doesn't talk much but he sure is cute."


I felt she was trying to reassure me. Her remark again sent
the others into gales of laughter.


Then Elise said in a lazy Southern drawl, "They won't let me
go to dinner tonight. I've got a pain in my stomach which is
nothing but you'd think I was an invalid. For crap sake, is this a
hospital or a reform school?"


"I'll smuggle you back some crackers," offered Kimberly. She
turned on her back and stared vacantly at the ceiling. Sue
looked at me through cold blue eyes, then turned away. I was
uncomfortably aware of her appraising glance and wanted to say
something warm, something that would appeal to this seemingly
forbidding person. But I didn't know where to begin.


At last I could bear the silence no longer and arose, saying,
"Well, I guess I'll go back to my room. By the way, do you know
what time it is?"


"There's a clock in the hall," said Sue, not unkindly, but as if
I should know about it.


I smiled my thanks and left. As I walked down the corridor, I

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had been in my room only a few minutes when a student
nurse appeared and said, "Your dinner will be arriving soon on
a tray."


Before I could ask her why I was not allowed to go into the
dining room with the others, she had vanished. I wondered if
they had found something wrong with me that they feared was
catching, or if they thought I would throw plates in the air in a
fit of fury. Then I happened to look in the closet and there was
the answer. The dark blue linen suit I had worn to the hospital
had disappeared, as had the other dresses I brought.


I went to the door and asked a passing nurse, "What has
happened to my clothes?"


"They'll be returned as soon as your name is sewn on them,"
she assured me. I felt relieved. I would not lose even more of my
identity wearing a regulation hospital gown, since we were
allowed our own dresses.


A young girl walked into my room carrying a tray covered
with paper napkins. She put the tray on the dresser and smiled,
saying, "Would you look at the food and let me know if there is
anything else you want?"


I removed the napkins from the plates and saw bread and
butter, slices of lamb, mashed potatoes, green peas, a pallid
pudding, and a glass of milk. "This is fine," I said.


As soon as the door closed behind her, I seized the tray and
sat down on the bed. I picked up the glass of milk hungrily and
took a sip. Then I shuddered in distaste. The milk was warm. I
placed the tray back on the dresser, the food untouched.


I stepped out into the hall and listened. It was deathly quiet.
I strained for any telltale noise, hoping someone had been left
behind. Then I heard the clearing of a throat and felt comfort. I
remembered Elise had been told not to go in for dinner because
she was sick.

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Soon I heard the unlocking of the front door at the other end
of the corridor and the noise of women returning from dinner. I
opened the door of my room, which was at the far end of the
hall, and looked out. The women were walking past my door to
enter a doorless, circular room.


I watched as some sat in armchairs which lined the tiled walls,
others stood in the center of the room pulling out cigarettes
from packages placed in a basket on a small table. A nurse
scurried past my door, taking a book of matches from her uniform
pocket as she walked. When she reached the circular room,
she struck a match. All the women gathered around her to light
their cigarettes. Then they returned to their seats or began to
talk in low tones, taking long, satisfying drags from the cigarettes.
I noticed that some opened newspapers or books and
started to read.


I wanted to join them but hesitated. Finally I walked into the
smoker and looked around. No one noticed me. I again felt like
an intruder. Yet I was more afraid to be alone on this first night
of separation than I was of these strange, unfriendly women. I
tried to appear unconcerned. Some stared at me openly, then
went back to smoking in solitude or talking among themselves.


Finally I said to the nearest one, "I'm Laura Rhodes. What's
your name?"


"I'm Betsy Smith," she said and turned her eyes to the ceiling.


"What do we usually do after dinner?" I asked.


"Not much. Sometimes we go and sit out on the lawn when
the weather's nice."


She resumed her vacant staring at the ceiling. I saw a few
women putting up a card table preparatory to playing bridge. I
said cheerfully to one of them, "I hope someone will teach me to
play. I never learned and always wanted to." No answer.


Four sat down at the table and dealt out a hand in silence.
Then the bidding started. I tried once more to start a conversation.
"Do you play bridge?" I asked a rather trim, middleaged
woman.

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No," she said and looked away from me.


I gave up and slowly walked back to my room. I lay down on
the bed and once more tried to think through what had brought
me to Lanier. The women in the smoker did not seem mentally
ill, at least not the way patients were supposed to be when they
were out of their minds. No one was raving mad, dancing nude
in the halls or screaming blasphemies at unknown enemies. If
anything, they seemed unusually quiet. Perhaps they didn't
have anything left to talk about, they had been there so long. I
would never be at a loss for something to say, I thought bitterly.
My trouble was that I talked too much at the wrong times, said
nothing at the times it might have counted.


I felt restless but there was no place to go. I heard someone
unlock the front door, then lock it. I kept listening for the key
to turn in the lock. There was nothing else to do.


Then a knock sounded on my door. "Come in," I said eagerly.
I would have welcomed the Abominable Snowman.


A tall, blond woman entered, blinking her eyes rapidly.
Speaking in a quick, nervous manner, she said, "Here is a book
you might read until you can get one from the library," and
held out a fifth-rate paperbound mystery novel.


"Thank you," I said, as gratefully as if she had brought me
the crown jewels. "Won't you sit down?"


She shook her head "no" and rushed out as quickly as she had
rushed in.


I looked for my glasses. They, like the dress, had disappeared.
I plunked myself down in the chair and tried to read. But the
only light was the one in the ceiling and for my poor eyes,
without glasses, it proved too dim. The letters were jagged and
jumbled.


I closed the book and sat there disgusted with my blind self,
my fat self, and the psychic pit into which I had plunged. Darkness
settled against the windowpane. The low buzz of talk from
the smoker next door was tantalizing but I felt too unwanted
there to return.


I decided I would write instead of read. I had brought a large

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After scribbling down my thoughts about my first day at
Lanier, I took off the robe and lay down but could not sleep. I
was about to call a nurse and ask for a sleeping pill (one, just
one, please, not a dozen or so like before) when a nurse walked
in and said, "The doctor's coming to examine you."


I put the robe back on and sat on the edge of the bed, now
choking with anxiety. What would he do to me? Then I laughed
to calm my fears. How ridiculous! Me, a doctor's wife, afraid of
a doctor. And I had undergone dozens of physical examinations
during my life, not to mention operations. Why should I be
afraid of a superficial physical?


Then I stopped the inner laughter. But this was different. It
wasn't just my body he would examine but my warped, illogical
mind. I was supposed to be crazy now, and if I said the wrong
thing in the wrong tone, maybe they would wrap me in restraining
sheets and shoot me to the isolation room. Even though I
knew who I was and where I was, they could do anything with
me they wanted. Maybe I really <i>wasn't</i> anyone and they would
decide I <i>was</i> out of my mind and stick me in solitary.


A tall, thin man entered and smiled at me. "I'm Dr. Flowers,"
he said cheerfully and sat down in the chair, placing the familiar
little black bag next to his feet. I felt reassured. His blue
eyes were kind and friendly, and his manner reminded me of
my husband. I felt he would not hurt me.


After giving a brief explanation about the necessity of a
physical as part of admission, he left the room while the nurse
helped me undress, then covered me with a sheet. The doctor
returned, examined my eyes and mouth and felt my neck. He
listened to my heart and tested my leg reflexes. He drew the
sheet away from my abdomen, pushed on my belly and noted
my appendicitis scar.


Suddenly the choking feeling returned. Was he going to do a

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My fears were wasted. He stood up after looking at the scar. I
sat up and sighed in relief.


"Don't go away yet," he said. "We're not quite finished."


Now what torture? Out of the little black bag he hauled a few
bottles and tubes. Is he going to give me horrible-tasting medicines?
I thought.


But, oddly enough, he opened one of the bottles and merely
sniffed its contents. Then he put it under my nose and asked,
"What is this odor?"


I sniffed too. "It smells like little boys do after they make toy
airplanes," I said.


He sniffed it again, asked the nurse to take a whiff, then said,
"You're right. It's camphor."


Then he asked me to sniff a few more bottles and identify the
odors. When the smelling tests were completed, he asked me to
taste several substances from the tubes. They were easy to
identify and by the time these tests were over I felt quite relaxed.
I had known all the answers. He couldn't call me crazy
and send me to solitary.


As he packed his bag, he said, "Would you like to ask me
anything before I go?"


"Yes, I would." I remembered my glasses. "Could I keep my
glasses at night? I can't read or see very well without them." I
had figured out that glasses were taken away at night in case
patients tried to break the glass and then cut their wrists. But it
seemed like removing my last shred of dignity. I longed to say
ironically to the doctor, "Don't worry, I won't use them to kill
myself. I tried--but the lenses wouldn't break."


"I'll see that you get them," he said and left.


The nurse asked, "Would you like a sleeping pill?"


"Yes, please." I was grateful for her thoughtfulness. I had

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The nurse returned with the tablet, I swallowed it and
climbed into bed. I waited for the little white pill to knock me
out. I hoped I would not fight it and that the dosage would be
strong enough to make me sleep all night, even though the
twelve or more I had taken not so long ago had not been lethal
enough to kill me.


The one pill propelled me into sleep. I must have been more
weary than I realized. Hours later, I dreamed someone opened
my door and shone a flashlight in my face. Then I slept again,
dreamlessly.


DR. ROBBINS:


As Laura Rhodes' story unfolds, we will see what happens
inside a private psychiatric hospital from her point of view. I
will try to explain what the function of the hospital is, what it
tries to do for the patient and, specifically, how it helped Laura.


Laura entered voluntarily, as more and more people are
doing, seeking the help that can be given by our private psychiatric
hospitals. But in spite of her willingness to go to the hospital,
she expected it to be a prison and "snake pit" where raving
maniacs ran screaming through the halls.


Her doubts reflect the very common distorted notions that
many people possess about psychiatric hospitals. These notions
are given impetus by the image of hospitals presented in the
press, movies, television, stage and books. This distortion also
stems from the fantasies of the public as it creates the same picture,
without the aid of press, movies, television, stage and
books, out of its fear, superstition and misinformation.


The psychiatric hospital exists for several purposes. First, to
protect those who need it from their self-destructive impulses.

For Laura, Lanier fulfills all three purposes. She has tried
to commit suicide and must be carefully watched. She needs to
be taken away from what she feels are intolerable pressures.
And she seems to have been chronically unsuccessful in being
a wife and mother. Removed some distance from the causes of
her stress, she may be able to take a look at why she is disturbed.


The psychiatric hospital treats people with many different
kinds of problems. Alcoholism, inability to work, drug addiction,
vague anxiety fears, incapacity to get along with others--
these are but some of the problems people bring to today's private
psychiatric hospital. The bizarre behavior of the raving
maniac is the exception, not the rule.


Laura's problem, however, was primarily one of depression.
Many of the precautions taken on her admission, such as removal
of her watch and the taking away of her glasses at night,
were necessary because of the two suicide attempts. The hospital
had no way of knowing whether she might not make another
within the next ten minutes.


The keys which the nurses wear, which made Laura feel a
prisoner, were also part of the precaution. The hospital must
guard the patient against any possible suicidal impulse--for
that protection he has come there. Even the lighting of cigarettes
is done by the nurses, so that some distraught woman will not
set fire to herself or the place.


As Laura enters, the emphasis is on the physical and neurological
examinations rather than psychological treatment. The
hospital, knowing how frightened patients usually are at first,
tries in all ways possible to make Laura feel more comfortable.
The supervisor of nurses escorts her to her room and points out,
along the way, what each building is, so Laura will feel less of a
stranger.


Laura finds the food unappetizing. It is difficult to make
institutional meals taste like home-cooked food, but in her

We get a sense of how the patients of Laura's age feel about
Lanier in the tone of their talk--like girls in a high school or
college dormitory banding together in a conspiracy against the
teachers--in this instance, the psychiatrists. But much of the
joking is a mixture of love and hate (called ambivalence) not
unlike what Laura feels toward Dr. Stewart.


While it is the task of the hospital staff to give help, patients,
even though they may be depressed and unhappy, often help
each other. The strange woman who brought Laura the book
realized how lonely she might be that first night and tried to
cheer her up. Patients often feel like allies against the common
enemy--the hospital.


Laura, luckily, liked to write and kept a diary, so that, in the
following pages, we can trace what happened to her during her
stay at Lanier. Perhaps, understanding more realistically the
purpose of a private psychiatric hospital, we may lose a few
distorted fantasies about it as a "snake pit."
