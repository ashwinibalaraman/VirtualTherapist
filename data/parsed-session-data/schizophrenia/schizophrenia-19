THE wheel of my years has spun 48 times and during that
period I have tried to destroy myself with pills, with gas,
with razor blades, with carbon monoxide and with alcohol. You'll
note that I haven't tried drowning or poison or hanging. That's
because death, to me, must be painless, like sleep. It isn't that
I am afraid. People tell me I should be, but I find no fear of
death in me. It is rather that I want the embrace of oblivion to
be soft and noiseless, undramatic. I would like to leave this
world causing even less of a ripple than I made when I came
into it. If I could, I would take an eraser and simply erase myself,
my existence, my history, my whole being, and let the
waters close over the place where I have been as if it had never
existed.


I can't say at what point in my life my obsession with death
began. I was an only child until I was nine years old, and with
the arrival of my brother, my life was thrown completely out
of focus. Fear death? I did indeed. Rings around the moon foretold
iminent destruction; a minor kidney ailment I developed at

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00008&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The gap of nine years between my birth when my mother
was eighteen and the birth of my brother when she was twenty-seven
was neither planned nor accidental. Having given birth
to one child, Mother apparently decided she did not wish to
repeat the experience. (I suspect that she, too, tried to outmaneuver
obstacles with the "sweetest of smiles.") At any rate, she
defeated succeeding pregnancies with every then known method
of home-abortion of the do-it-yourself variety, including such
ingenious devices as clothes hangers, lye douches, and similar
tactics, which usually landed her in the hospital. Nevertheless,
my brother weighed in at well over nine pounds and grew to be
6'3" tall, which says something about his determination to put
in an appearance in this world. I have some thoughts as to
whether one's conception and birth may not be acts of will
rather than accidents, but that is the subject of another book.
This book is about how to get <i>out</i> of this world, not <i>into</i> it.


Seventeen years after the surprise of my arrival (and I really
was a surprise because my mother's mother did not believe in
any form of sex education), a second girl outwitted all of Mother's
fetus-discouragers, and I had a sister. As my death wish was
pretty well established by that time, my sister's arrival did not
disturb me. Or perhaps it did, for I made my first suicide attempt
at the age of eighteen.


What and how children learn is the subject of much discussion
these days, as anyone who has struggled through Piaget and

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00009&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My childhood was spent in a series of small towns, in a series
of small schools, in a series of small and mostly unpleasant experiences,
out of which I have never been able to make an integrated
whole. From the age of twelve, there was greater stability
in my physical environment, but I still feel my life has been
episodic, and one of my present struggles is to bring some degree
of coherence into it. I have described it as an archipelago, a rather
aimless string of islands with no obvious connection. I lived
for a while in one place doing one thing, and then I jumped
to another place doing another thing, but there was no relationship
between the two places, no means of communication, no
sense of continuity, not even any luggage.


Now I feel the time has come for me to move to another
island, but I can't. Too many hands are holding on to me, too
many people need me, and I am stifled. I have lost love, and the
harder I search for it, the darker everything gets.


I am racked by a fever of the bones. I put out my hand and
touch nothing. The earth presses against my chest, but I can
see the stars; I am traversing the hardest of passages. Am I alive,
or is this death? If I am alive, why am I so alone? If this is death,
how do I perceive all of the segments of my knowing as real? The
books, the rugs, the pictures, the doors are all as they should
be, or have been, or might have been. And the people—they
smile, hold hands, dance and cry, but are they as they should
be, or have been, or might have been? Are they there at all? Am
I? If I could find the thread that binds my life into a whole, then
I would know. But in the meantime, this is neither life nor
death—it is madness.

My insane self rattles through this body, trying to find a way
out. But where did my insanity start? Or was I born with it?
The pre-school me lived in a duplex apartment in a fair-sized
town in Colorado, where my father worked as a policeman, my
mother worked in a laundry, and I was in the care of my crazy
grandmother who sat all day with her feet in the oven and did
not speak to anyone for months. Our nearest neighbors were my
god-parents who, as this was during Prohibition, made home
brew and fed a great deal of it to me. At the age of three, I was
frequently staggering when my mother came home from work,
which may account for my present devotion to fermented beverages.
The god-parents had a daughter who, it was whispered
when I wasn't supposed to be listening, had to be put in an institution
because of her inability to cope with life. A dark and
shameful secret, and a good reason for imbibing all that home
brew.


We were Lithuanian Catholics and most of our neighbors
were Jews; my relationships with the neighborhood children
were affected from day to day by their feelings about "goys." On
Sundays, I roamed the area begging breakfast, often coming home
with my hands full of oranges and cookies. When we had visitors,
I was warned by my mother not to reveal that the bites
covering my face and arms were caused by bedbugs. We had our
dark and shameful secrets, too.


Are these the ingredients of insanity? When I was five, my
father went to work for a construction crew of the telephone
company, and therewith began the movings from town to town
and school to school. Until I was twelve, we moved every
three or four mouths, and I never attended the same school
twice. In each new community, the routine was always the
same: "What's your name?" "Mary W_____." "Mary <i>what?</i>"
"Mary W_____." "How'dya spell it?" "W_____." "What kinda
name is that? "Lithuanian." "Lithu-what? Where's that?" Finally
I started calling myself a Russian because everybody knew
where Russia was.

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00011&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What's your fatter do?" they would ask. "He's a mechanic,"
I would reply. Actually, he was a truck driver, but that was too
low on the social scale to be admitted. As it was, the fact that
we were so transient made me too much of a peculiar object.
The final query was always, "What church d'ya go to?" Instinctively,
I avoided answering that one until I had identified
the most popular church in town, which then became the church
of my choice. As a result, my religious education includes nearly
every variety of Christianity extant, including the Pillar of Fire.


Theoretically, all of this should have made me tough. And
maybe it did, but I have covered it up with a retiring manner
and that sweet smile, for to enter a new community with a
tough exterior was asking for trouble. I had trouble enough with
my name, my nationality, and my newness.


Give the wheel another spin and see what comes up on the
opposite side. Instead of an obsession with death, there is the
fear of death. Now that is much more manageable; it is historical,
it is universal. It begins in childhood with: Grandpa died.
Will you die? Will I? And we get to: "Now I lay me down to
sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep." And we get to angels
who watch over you. And we get to death as a form of helplessness,
and thence to insomnia because sleep is a form of helplessness
and therefore a form of death.


All my adult life, I have struggled with the basic contradiction
between insomnia, representing a fear of death on the one hand,
and an obsession with death represented by a desire to commit
suicide on the other.


Sleep I pursued night after night past the horrendous demons
and devils and other dreadful creatures that inhabited the corners
of my dark bedroom as a child. Sleep I pursued when I was
first a student in college and knew there were no monsters in
my bedroom and was all the more terrified for knowing that.
Sleep I despaired of when I lived alone in New York City and
could not let go of wakefulness until daybreak. So night was my
enemy and death was my friend, and never the twain shall meet?

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I was eighteen, I took myself off to the state university
where I registered as a pre-med student (God bless the illusions
of the young). In a fairly short time, I found myself less and
less able to concentrate, to sleep, to eat, to converse, to think, or
to function at all. I spent most of my free time in a nearby
cemetery where it was peaceful and green and the residents
were indifferent. I wrote poetry and tore it into shreds and
watched it float away on a small stream that wandered among
the graves. I envied the dead their tranquillity.


In those days, school dormitories had rules, and one of them
was that the girls had to be in their rooms by 10:00 p.m. I ignored
that rule one night (sweetly, no doubt), and walked to the
home of the school psychologist (by way of the cemetery), where
I wrapped myself in some burlap bags in his garage and went to
sleep. How it was that I could sleep in these circumstances and
not in a warm, comfortable bed, I don't know. At any rate, this
kindly gentleman found me in the morning, returned me to my
dorm and somehow convinced the Dean of Women that I should
not be expelled. I completed the term with an unremarkable
academic record.


I understand that the reason for all this internal turmoil was
a kind of separation anxiety. It was the first time I had been
away from home, and I was very dependent on my parents, especially
my mother. And yet, on school holidays, I refused to visit
them, but stayed with friends instead. Are all psychological
truths represented by contradictions?


When the school term ended, I returned to my home town,
but not to my home. I stayed with the mother and stepfather
of my best friend, got a job, and once a week visited a psychiatrist.
I remember him very clearly as a large man with skin
problems. His face was always dotted with little spots of white
cream, and as he had a florid complexion, this gave him a clownish
appearance. He had a glass-topped desk and when I talked
to him, I ran my fingers along the edge of the glass. He told me

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Somewhere around 11:00 the following morning, the firm for
which I worked telephoned to inquire about my absence. Dave,
my girl friend's stepfather (whom I had known since I was 12),
woke me, fed me black coffee, walked me around the house,
telephoned my doctor, took me to the county psychiatric hospital
and signed me in as a patient. If he had known then how often
he was to send me to a hospital when I tried to commit suicide,
perhaps he would not have been so compassionate.


I was hospitalized for nearly three months, during which time
I was given insulin shock treatments six times a week for six
weeks.


Insulin shock is no longer used in the treatment of mental
illness as it has been found to be less effective and more dangerous
than other methods. A sufficient amount of insulin was injected
intravenously to cause unconsciousness and convulsions.
Several hours later, the patient awoke to find himself in a bed
soaked with perspiration, frequently tied down to the mattress
with twisted bedsheets. It was not a pleasant experience. Sometimes
I woke up earlier than the other patients and heard them
moaning and screaming. Everything was white and damp and
surreal; I could not believe this was happening to me.


Care had to be taken that the full effect of the insulin was
felt at the time of its administration; a delayed reaction could
cause trouble, as any diabetic can tell you. On one occasion, my
insulin injection didn't "take" because I was excited about going
home for the week-end. (By this time, I had resolved my feelings
of repugnance toward my parents.) I was unconscious, but I
did not have convulsions, which apparently nobody noticed.
Then, as now, hospitals were understaffed.


Later that day, as I was being driven home by my father's

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Recalling this incident fills me with sadness. I am struck by
the fact that neither of my parents came to the hospital to pick
me up for my first visit home after so many months and so
much turbulence. I suppose there was a reason for this, but I
don't know what is was. I thoroughly disliked the man they
sent; he was usually drunk and dirty, and I was uncomfortable
in his presence. I can remember now my excitement at the
prospect of going home, and my disappointment when this man
arrived to take me there.


Life in a mental hospital in 1944 was considerably different
than it is in the more liberalized institutions of today. Group
therapy had not yet been invented (or was it discovered, like
plutonium?), but occupational therapy was a daily part of our
routine (I embroidered pillow cases), as was physical therapy,
consisting of a supervised walk around the hospital grounds two
or three times a week. The psychiatric unit was housed in a
separate building from the main hospital. On the ground floor
were the administrative offices; on the second floor was the
men's ward, and on the third, the women's. Each ward had a
special wing reserved for disturbed patients, i.e., those who had
to be restrained. The windows of the second and third floors
were barred, and all the doors, of which there were a great many,
were locked. After every meal, the silverware was counted before
the patients were allowed to leave the dining room.

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I did, and still do, suffer from vascular headaches, for which
no medication was given. Sleeplessness was similarly regarded
as unimportant, but after much complaining I was finally
given a dose of paraldehyde, after which I decided I would rather
stay awake. On the other hand, huge quantities of medication
were provided after every meal, half a jigger full of pills and
capsules of varying shapes, sizes and colors. I never knew what
they were for, and sometimes I wonder if the hospital staff did
either. When I entered the hospital, I was given a battery of intelligence,
psychological and physical tests, and I surmise that
now and then I saw a doctor, although I am not sure about that.


When I left the hospital, I closed my eyes, hoping to erase
forever the vision of those barred windows. I vowed that I would
never see the inside of another mental hospital as long as I
lived—and I managed to keep that vow for about 25 years. For
this period of my life, I have a fragment of a poem:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>I dreamed I was mad one night<br />
And when I awoke, it was true</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>


<i>I dreamed I was mad one night<br />
And when I awoke, it was true</i>.


How do you put yourself together after six months of madness?
After shocks and convulsions and barred windows and
spinal taps and paraldehyde and forced dances with men who
are no saner than you are? (I forgot to mention that every Saturday,
the men and women were brought together for a little
socializing—was this to represent reality?) I was advised to take
a job requiring hard physical labor, so I went to work in a war
plant where bomb casings were made. I worked there as a lathe
operator for six weeks—two weeks on the day shift, two weeks
on the swing shift, two weeks on the graveyard shift. The noise
of the machines, the difficulty of adjusting to unnatural sleeping
schedules, the feeling of being an outsider among workers who
spoke their own special language—these things combined to
drive me to the ragged edge of my new-found sanity, so I quit.


My illness was diagnosed as schizophrenia, or split personality,

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have a tendency to make jokes about my illness, especially
its suicidal aspects. This tendency is deplored by my psychiatrist
and all others associated with me therapeutically as psychologically
unhealthy. But I think the reason I do this is that
I don't always take my illness seriously, just as I know there
are thousands of ordinary, hard-working people who don't take
mental illness seriously either. If I tried really hard to be one of
those ordinary, hard-working people whose values are never
questioned and whose responsibilities are never shirked, maybe
I wouldn't be sick. For years, I felt that my attempted suicide
and hospitalization at the age of eighteen was merely a case of
aggravated self-pity, and that if I had had a little more strength
of character, I could have avoided the entire episode, which was
painful not only to me but to my family and others who loved
me. It was not until I was in my thirties and described these
events to another psychiatrist that I was brought up short with
the comment: "The people at the hospital obviously thought
you were sick."


I have been accused of playing at suicide as at a game of Russian
roulette, in which three of the chambers are loaded and
I laugh as I hold the gun to my head. This would make it an
act of deliberate cruelty, completely lacking in compassion. Perhaps
so, but wouldn't it also be a form of madness?


As a child, my favorite game, next to jump-rope, was hopscotch,
and I would loiter around the school yard after hours
hoping the other girls would invite me to join their play. I find
certain similarities between my life and the game of hopscotch—
the magical attributes of the talisman one uses as a stone, the
skill of being able to balance on one foot while performing

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

From my home town and hospital and my first rather dismal
experience with sex, I hopscotched to New York City, armed
with a couple of letters of introduction, an invitation to live
with a girl friend for a short time, and about $300 in cash. The
letters and the encouragement to make the jump were provided
by my girl friend's stepfather, Dave, who remained interested in
my welfare after I was released from the hospital.


It was toward the end of September 1945 when I went to
New York, and World War II was over at last. Apartments were
impossible to find, but I found one; jobs were hard to get, but I
got one; I took my first ride on a subway and a man dropped
a rose in my lap. I was, for the first time in my life, independent,
alone, and happy. I even managed to squeeze in to the opening
sessions of New York University's fall term.


The apartment had three rooms and bath, and was gifted with
steam heat and hot water. Its principal disadvantage was that it
was on the sixth floor of a building without an elevator. It was
equipped with an ice box, for which I could seldom persuade the
ice man to bring me any ice. Its five flights of stairs discouraged
idle visitors and discouraged me from doing much running
around. It cost $26 a month and was located on the fringe of
Greenwich Village, two blocks from Washington Square, where
I worked by day and went to school by night.


I lived there for four years, and I remember those years as the
happiest of my life. I tried suicide only once, toward the end
of my sojourn, with some pills—I don't even remember what
they were, probably something prescribed for sleep or headaches.
I was promptly taken to the hospital where I received an injection
of caffeine and was sent home. I was saying <i>Help!</i> about
something, but nobody paid any attention. Suicides are a dime
a dozen in New York.


I have tried and tried to analyze why those first few years in
New York have such special significance for me. Whereas my

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My happiness in my early twenties, however, derived at least
in part from the processes of learning—the formal learning in
university classrooms, the learning associated with my job, the
extracurricular learning (I wrote a poetry column for the school
newspaper), and, most important, the learning to manage my
own life on my own terms, alone. I spent most of my money on
books and lived on a diet of tomato soup and cheese sandwiches.
I lost weight and on occasion was literally and poignantly hungry,
but that did not matter. "You're too thin," my mother would
say when I went home for summer vacation. Too thin? For the
first time since puberty, I weighed exactly what I wanted to
weigh.


There was also my sex education. My mother had informed
me where babies grew and how they were born, but she had
neglected to inform me how they got started. The psychiatrist I
saw when I was eighteen found he had to instruct me about the
sex act, beginning at the beginning. He did this with diagrams
showing male and female sex organs and how they came together.
"An orgasm is like a sneeze," he said. I remember feeling
quite shocked about the whole thing.


In retrospect, this seems rather odd, as I had slept in the same
room as my parents until the age of four or five, and it does
not seem possible that I could have avoided witnessing sex in
action at some point during that period. And yet, when I was
sixteen, and was kissed on the mouth by a boy for the first
time, I was terribly worried that I might become pregnant. Let's
all bow our heads to Freud and the act of suppression.

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My first lover was a student at an Episcopalian divinity school
and knew a great deal more about sex than one would expect
from that sort of scholar. However, he had at one time been an
actor and was very dramatic, articulate and persuasive. He was
also very poor and fed me cheap sherry, on which I got stinking
drunk. After a while, he bored me and our relationship shriveled,
along with my interest in Episcopalianism. The main thing I
learned from him was how to masturbate—something the psychiatrist
had omitted from his lessons.


My first husband was the son of a very orthodox Jewish family.
When he declared his intention of marrying me, his mother
threatened to throw herself out of the window, and his father
said he would wipe his name from the list of his children. But
all these pronouncements turned Henry's heart to stone (as
God must have hardened the heart of the Pharaoh), and his determination
to marry a "goy" became more inflexible than ever.
Besides, he said, they would never carry out their threats.


Perhaps Henry was right, but I wanted no part in this catastrophe,
real or intended, and I offered to convert to Judaism
and become a proper Yiddisher hausfrau. Judaism is not a proselytizing
religion in the first place, and Henry's mother did not
help matters much by sending me to a rabbi who had not performed
a conversion in seven years and who was a refugee from
Nazi Germany. His first remarks to me were: "Are you prepared
to see Long Island become a huge concentration camp?" "How
will you react when your neighbors spit on you for being a Jew?"


My motivation for embarking upon the marriage must have
been as strong as my intended husband's, for I persuaded this
suspicious, cynical old gentleman (who turned out to be immensely
kind) that I was a suitable candidate for Judaic womanhood.
He taught me the rules and rituals of Jewish housekeeping,
cooking, holiday-making, religious exercises, and wifely duties.
When I had mastered these elements to his satisfaction, I was
taken to a mikvah, a sort of Jewish bathhouse, where the conversion
ceremony was performed. I disrobed and descended into

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Henry and I were married in accordance with Jewish ritual
in the apartment of the rabbi who had performed the conversion.
Henry's parents were there, and my mother, scared and
bewildered, had come east for the wedding, declaring that for me
to become a Jew was better than for me to have no religion at
all. Prior to the ceremony, Henry lifted my veil to ascertain that
he was getting the right bride (a custom stemming from the
trick played on Isaac when he was given Leah instead of Rachel
after seven years' hard labor); the marriage was duly sanctified
under a canopy (signifying togetherness), and the wine glass was
satisfactorily shattered under the heel of Henry's right foot (a
gesture whose meaning has been lost to me). Following the
ceremony, as we had no need to become better acquainted physically
after living together for two years, Henry and I went to
the movies.


I discovered almost immediately that not only did Henry not
want a Jewish housewife, but he was no more interested in
maintaining an orthodox Jewish household than a Japanese
prime minister. We did install a mezuzah on the front doorpost,
but that was the only outward admission he made of his
heritage. A mezuzah is a small hollow plaque containing certain
verses from the old Testament inscribed on parchment; it
commemorates the final plague visited upon the Egyptians by
God when the Angel of the Lord slew all of the first-born except
those in the specially marked houses of the Jews.


I was not allowed to keep a kosher kitchen with its separate

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That I could not become a practicing Jew and that I was not
accepted as a full member of the family hurt me deeply, for I
think now that one of my reasons for entering into this marriage
was to become a part of a living, 6000-year-old tradition
that would give some meaning to my life. As it was, I participated
only on the fringe. I baked the challah (Sabbath bread
made with eggs and decorated with a braid running along the
top); I attended Passover dinners at the home of my parents-in-law,
and I remember with particular fondness the glass of wine
that was always set out for Elijah. Henry and I had been married
on Christmas day, so that we always had an especially
festive Channukah.


Henry, on the other hand, delighted in defying Jewish customs.
One of his favorite practices was to walk through the Jewish
East side, where he had been born, on Yom Kippur, eating a
ham and cheese sandwich. Yom Kippur is a day of absolute
fasting, and of course Jews are not permitted to eat ham.


One might call this marriage another in the series of contradictions.
I married Henry in order to embrace a meaningful tradition;
he married me in order to contravene it. The marriage
lasted seven years. I worked most of that time, writing and
doing research, for the Government of Pakistan; Henry flunked

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During our marriage, I attempted suicide twice, the first time
with a razor blade from which I still bear the scar. Henry found
me in the bathroom and took me around the corner to a very
uninquisitive doctor who accepted our story that I had cut my
wrist when the knife slipped while I was trying to slice a bagel.
The second time, I closed the kitchen door and turned on all
the gas jets of the stove, putting my head in the oven. Once
again, Henry discovered me and walked me around Manhattan
until I stopped feeling dizzy and looking blue. On neither occasion
did I seek psychiatric counsel, for I was afraid that a doctor
would put me in a hospital, and I was terrified of hospitals. At
no time did anyone recognize that attempted suicide is a cry
for help.


Was what I said then any different from what I am saying
now? I don't remember such dark despair, but I was surely a
very unhappy woman, suffering from what would probably have
been identified as a psychological depression. I felt trapped and
lonely, moving in meaningless circles. But whereas then I found
a way out of my trap, today I see none. My trap is my body itself,
which is a heavy thing, lifeless and stupid, pulling me down
into a dull, grey fog. The only way out is to get rid of it.


I left Henry in November of 1956, just one month short of
our seventh wedding anniversary, taking with me my cat, my
piano, my books and clothing, and moving into a large studio
apartment on the upper West Side of Manhattan. The reasons
for the dissolution of the marriage are rather hard to explain. I
felt strongly that I was not being allowed to grow, that the marriage
and/or Henry were stifling me. I compared myself to a

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What he wanted from me basically was the Yiddisher hausfrau
without the religious embroidery. He wanted me to be
home every evening, to wax and polish the floors and furniture
once a week, to do all the grocery shopping and to have dinner
on the table at the appointed time, whether he was there or
not—and frequently he was not. On the other hand, I was not
allowed to do any personal shopping whatever. Henry bought
every garment I wore, including my underwear and shoes, saying
that I did not have "good taste." On this latter point, he may
have been right, but I would have liked at least to accompany
him on these shopping expeditions. He was a clever artist and
should have been a fashion designer, but he lacked the discipline
and the drive. After I left him, he became a professional gigolo
for a while, boasting to me of his triumphs with older women
—and younger ones, too. He eventually remarried, this time in
a church and to a Presbyterian.


Many marriages have survived on much more fragile
structures than ours, and it is certainly hard to discern any formidable
reasons for suicide arising out of our relationship. Suicide
is a desperate act. Razor blades and gas are not indulged in just
for the experience. But Henry was not sadistic; he did not beat
me, or come home drunk, or stay out all night with other women.
Why, then, did I feel driven toward that "desperate act?"
It's as though the germs of suicide lived within me, and from
the age of eighteen when they appeared above the surface until
recently when they flowered, they were nurtured and nourished
in my own private garden. How did they start? Who planted
them?

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is speculation that a tendency toward mental illness is
genetic, just like tuberculosis or diabetes. There is little question
that my "crazy grandmother" (my father's mother) was a depressive.
She was a "mail-order bride" at 15, bore her first child (my
father) at 16, followed quickly by two girls, at which point she
put an end to the whole thing through the most effective contraceptive
known to women, namely by saying "No." From
then on, she hated men, marriage and childbirth, and built a
world of fantasy around herself into which she retreated whenever
she needed to. On her living room wall there hung, in an
ornate frame, a magazine illustration of a large, colonial-style
house surrounded by an expanse of lawn. In the corner of the
picture, she had pasted photographs of herself and one of her
daughters to look as if they were walking across the grass toward
the house. This was the way she wanted her life to be, and
this was perhaps the way it was during her long days of silence.
She was a tall, impressive woman who lived well into her 80s,
surviving her alcoholic husband by at least ten years Deeply
religious, she never, as far as I know, considered suicide.


My father is also alcoholic, and subject to dark moods and
flashes of bitter temper. He is a lonely and unhappy man who
makes liaisons with very strange women and has been in trouble
with the police on several occasions. During the past few years,
my meetings with him have been extremely painful. He is sensitive,
but he can also be cruel, and my feelings toward him
are very contradictory. I am torn by this ambivalence, which
probably extends into my relationships with all men. I wanted
his love so much, but never felt he cared. I was a nuisance, an
object that got in the way of what he was doing. The fifth grade
was as far as he got in school, and I think that all he ever wanted
was to be outdoors and unencumbered.


My mother died some years ago of a heart attack, which
came as no surprise, as she had had a long-standing heart condition
stemming from childhood rheumatic fever. My feelings
toward her were ambivalent, too. On the one hand, she was my

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Curiously, I find that in my poetry I have written nothing
of the ambivalences of love and hate, sin and virtue, life and
death, sorrow and happiness, anger and pleasure, and yet it is
these and similar contradictions which are tearing my soul apart
and driving me to suicide. I feel that the world must be all one
or the other, that there is no room for the dichotomy of Jung,
that the land must be land and the sea must be sea and I cannot
tolerate the existence of both at the same time and in the same
place.


I have known many kinds of love: sexual, marital, maternal,
and have been passionately possessed by each of them. But love
contains its opposite; a whole love includes hate, just as God
contains the devil. There is always the other side of the coin,
but I have tried to live my life without ever turning it over, and
now I am possessed by the dark side of things. I have loved, but
no love has been fulfilling; I have been loved, but no love has
been sufficient. I must face the deeply terrible truth that I can
no longer love, or be loved. I harbor in my depths an ugliness
that is beyond redemption.


A great deal has been written about the pain and travail associated
with divorce, and it is a wrenching experience, no matter
what the terms. My divorce from Henry was a reasonably
amicable one, but I soon discovered that women regard divorcees
with suspicion and men regard them as sex-starved. Henry never
did understand my reasons for wanting a divorce, ultimately
blaming it on the fact that we had been unable to have children,
even though we had tried artificial insemination.

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On one occasion after the divorce, Henry became violent. I
stayed out late with one of my co-workers from the office (I was
by this time working as a copywriter for an advertising agency),
and on returning to my apartment, I found Henry standing at
the door with a butcher knife in his hand. He was in a jealous
rage, forced his way in, and swore that, if I did not come back to
live with him as his wife, he would kill me. He strode back and
forth across the room, his face red, his hand clutching the knife,
and I curled up on the sofa, trying to be invisible, as children
do when they feel the presence of the demon in the bedroom
at night. I did not know whether he would use the knife or not,
but I was not about to aggravate his anger with argument. If I
were very, very still, he might forget about me and go away.


Finally, he stood in front of me and demanded that I return
to his apartment. I bargained for time, asking him to give me
until the next day to sort out my things. The idea of having
sexual relations with him again made me feel sick. After he left,
I shut myself up into the little cupboard/kitchen and turned on
all the gas jets (apparently, I preferred to kill myself rather than
let him do it). Unfortunately, the building was not very well
constructed, and soon all of my neighbors were hammering on
my door. I don't think they were as concerned about the danger
to me as they were about the danger to them—after all, the gas
might explode.


When the next day arrived, so did Henry, but with an apology
instead of a butcher knife, and although he contacted me frequently
after that, he never again attempted or threatened violence.
Even after I had remarried and moved to California, Henry
found out where I was and called me at least once a year to
"find out if I had had a baby yet." The calls stopped coming before
the baby arrived.


I have a theory that the magic number in my life is nine—
the period of gestation among humans. I was almost nine when
my brother was born; I was eighteen when I was first hospitalized;
my relationship with Henry lasted for nine years (counting

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have a number of faults that some people label virtues. For
one thing, I am always on time, much to the dismay of many
party hostesses. For another, I am incapable of infidelity within
the context of marriage. Unmarried, however, I slept with whom
and when I pleased, regarding other women's husbands as fair
game. In fact, I probably preferred other women's husbands because
they lived on the other side of the fence marked "Forbidden."
So, whereas I would not commit adultery, I did not object
to participating in someone else's adulterous adventure. In
a way, it was safe because it did not require a commitment.


Between marriages, I led an active, complex and frequently
passionate sex life. I remember once taking an overdose of tranquilizers,
although there weren't enough pills in the bottle to do
any real damage. I learned from this that it takes a sizeable quantity
of pills to cause death, unless they are very high-powered
ones, such as prussic acid or cyanide. Also, I don't think I was
very serious about the attempt. Something had happened with
my lover which made me feel rejected, and my response was
equivalent to a child's "I'll get even with you, I'll run away from
home." When I was a child, I ran away from home only once,
and my mother's reaction was so laconic that I decided running
away wasn't worth much as a weapon.


Since rescuing me from my first suicide attempt, my old friend
and mentor, Dave, had divorced his first wife and moved to Connecticut,
where he was living with his second wife. Instead of
stepdaughters, he now had a daughter of his own, of whom he

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Like my other lovers, Dave was much older than I—21 years
older, in fact. He was a person of enormous vitality, enthus iasm,
charm, deviousness, intelligence, humor and demonstrativeness.
To be with him was exciting and warm and wonderful.
He made me feel important, and he made me feel genuinely
loved, even though there was no question, in the beginning, of a
permanent relationship. We were having fun together, meeting
for dinner, spending the night in each other's aims, parting at
breakfast. It was "just one of those things." He had other women,
and I had other men, and in time our feelings for each other
would wear off and we would go our separate ways—or so we
thought.


It didn't happen that way. Our nightcap stingers took longer
and longer to drink; our morning partings became lingering and
tearful; he made extra trips into New York and invented reasons
for spending the week-end. I remember carrying loads of jonquils
over to the apartment one day in spring. "I love you," they
said, although we were careful not to use those words. We spent
three weeks together once, each of us working on a book by day
and making love by night, with the blessing, it seemed, of all the
stars in the sky. We talked a lot, drank a lot, shared a lot. There
seemed to be no end to our sharing, or to the completeness of
our being together. It was an example of that curious fact of
love which says: I must give all of myself in order to be complete.


We hadn't intended falling in love, but we did. Over a period
of about two years, our involvement with each other became
increasingly intense and exclusive. The spiral that had brought
us together bound us more and more closely without our realizing

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The first break came when Dave's wife found out about us.
He had called her "Mary" so often that she became suspicious
and asked questions. Upon hearing his confession at two o'clock
in the morning, she phoned me. Several times. I had been a guest
in her home. I had typed a manuscript for her. I had been a
friend to her daughter. And I had betrayed all that, she said, by
seducing her husband. She called me a great many ugly names.
She told me I was destroying her and her daughter's happiness.
She said she hoped I could sleep. I said nothing, for I had nothing
to say. Everything she said was true.


The next day, Dave phoned to tell me he had agreed not to
see me again. I held the telephone as if it were frozen in my hand
and said, "All right," for, once again, I had nothing to say. The
decision was being made without me. One would think that this
would have been the occasion for another suicide attempt, but it
did not happen. I simply could not believe that our relationship
was going to end. There was too much between us, so much
love, so much knowledge. It could not be cut off so abruptly.


Nor was it. Two weeks later, we were together again, but with
his wife's knowledge. We tried to work out a compromise. He
loved me, but he also loved her and was devoted to his daughter.
He did not want to put an end to the marriage, but he did not
want to relinquish me, either. Why could we not establish some
sort of balance among us? People in other cultures did it.


But we were not people in some other culture. I wanted more,
and she could not accept less. In the end, we nearly tore Dave
in two, and he decided to move to California, where he was
working on a television series. He would leave both of us behind
and wait for the dust to settle.


I think a lot more dust was stirred up than was settled during
that period. I don't know how often he called her, but he called
me at least once a day, sent me roses for Valentine's Day, wrote
me long, pornographic letters (which I still have), and in general

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But I was ambivalent. One night I went out with a man of
whom I was extremely fond (and Dave knew this) and did not
get home until three o'clock in the morning. Dave had been trying
to phone me, but had abandoned the attempt before I got
back to the apartment. He phoned the next day in great distress
and asked me to marry him. I thought this was a joke and said
Yes, but I'd have to get some time off from my job. He said to
let him know which flight I would take.


I still worked as an advertising copywriter, and my first novel
was to be published later that year. I asked my boss if I could
have two weeks off to go to California. He said we were too busy
and the answer was No. That night I called Dave and told him
I was sorry, but I could not come just yet. To which Dave replied,
"What the hell are you talking about? I want you to quit
your job and come out here and live with me. I've already found
a house."


It was then I realized he was serious. The next day I went into
the office and told my boss I was resigning in order to go to
California and get married. He knew Dave and, looking at me
incredulously, said, "It'll never work, Mary; it'll never work."
I wept a little then, but his words had no more effect upon me
than the motes in a sunbeam. My relationship with Dave was
the right one, the only one, and whatever was required to insure
it would be done.


In two weeks, I had sold the possessions I could not take with
me, packed the ones I could (I had to part with my beloved
piano, but was able to take the cat), said goodbye to everyone

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dave met the plane, drove me to a little tiny house he had
rented in Burbank (which smelled, believe it or not, of orange
blossoms), carried me over the threshold, tossed me on the bed,
and we made love. We were together, breathing the same air. I
can still remember how the sun was shining in that room, even
though the blinds were drawn. The past had dissolved and there
was only the present. I lay beside him, not dreaming, not caring,
not thinking. He was the man I loved, the only man I had ever
truly loved, I was with him and that was sufficient.


I write all this through a veil—a veil of tears, of unbelief, of
grief, of incredulity, of fine tissue paper, of a feeling that thickens
around me like glue and another feeling that is as unreal as the
laughter of an elf. Did all this happen the way I am saying it
did? And there's more, there's incredibly more. Is this how I
got from there to here? If that is true, then I should be able to
flap my arms and fly like a moth. I got from that island to this
one, and I'm still on this one. I've tried like hell to get off this
one, but I'm still on it. Moreover, there are people who are trying
to tell me that this isn't a series of islands at all, that it's
all one solid piece of land that begins where my father squirted
his sperm into my mother's vagina and the resultant union became
me. Well, do you want to know something, God? Do you
want to know something, whoever's responsible for this fucking
universe? I wish my father hadn't done it. I WISH HE HADN'T
DONE IT!


That little house in Burbank was happiness. The life we
lived there was fun and crazy and unbelievable, and when I
think that I have brought our life together from that to this, I
despise myself for carrying along my suitcase of sorrow and the
heritage of my lunatic grandmother and my inoperable illness.
We dreamed of a house on a hill looking out over a gentle
meadow and we thought we had won it, but it was as unreal
as that picture in my grandmother's living room and I am truly

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dave's wife and daughter also came to California, and during
the summer, we had a kind of <i>ménage à trois</i>. They lived in the
northern part of the state, I lived in the southern, and Dave
commuted twice a week. We were all too grimly determined to
make it work, but it developed into a kind of contest to see who
could maintain her poise longer. Dave still wanted to protect
his marriage, to be an intimate part of his daughter's life. I tried
to understand this, but I also resented it, and his wife was near
despair. We were all relieved when the summer came to an end
and the entire troop returned to the East where, it seemed, the
situation would reach some sort of resolution.


Dave's wife insisted that he consult a psychiatrist before deciding
on a divorce; she believed that his infatuation with me
was a temporary aberration which would correct itself with time
and/or therapy. She selected the therapist—and I am reminded
that it was Henry's mother who chose the rabbi to convert me
to Judaism, thereby making my first marriage possible. Once
again, a decision affecting my future was being made without
my participation.


From September through Thanksgiving, the <i>ménage à trois</i>
continued—wife and daughter in Connecticut, mistress in New
York City, Dave shuttling back and forth and visiting the psychiatrist
three times a week. We waited, or rather we hovered
over the inevitable, as observers at a rocket ship launch count
down the seconds before blast-off. The explosion came at the
end of November when Dave made a final break with his wife.
The divorce was granted, Dave and I returned to our wee house
in Burbank, and the psychiatrist ran off to Tahiti with his mistress.
That was fourteen years ago. Since then, we have all made
peace—although I have no further details about the psychiatrist.


The succeeding years were active ones. We traveled, mostly by
car; we entertained; I learned to replace my love for the mountains
with a love for the sea; Dave bought a horse. We drank a
lot, talked a lot, wrote a lot. I had three more novels published.

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But there was a flaw in it somewhere, and I was afraid. Early
in 1963, I learned about a program being conducted under the
auspices of Stanford University to study the effects of LSD-25 on
normal people. A friend of ours had participated in the program
and had been so impressed and altered by it that he had written
a book called <i>The Discovery of Love</i>. Dave was somewhat reluctant
about my taking part in the program, but he finally
agreed and took me to inquire about the details.


I was interviewed by a psychologist, examined by a doctor,
and given a final screening by the psychiatrist who was in charge
of the program. I told him about being hospitalized when I was
eighteen, but I did not reveal the intervening suicide attempts.
He was unsure at first, but I won his acceptance by saying that
perhaps LSD would enable me to understand that experience
and the nature of my illness. Also, he was particularly interested
in the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholics, and I admitted
that I had an alcohol problem. In fact, when I told the staff
how much I smoked and drank in the course of a day, they
wondered how I had time to do anything else.


The next step was a series of psychological tests, beginning
with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI),
a lengthy yes/no test in which the same questions are repeated
any number of times with different phraseologies so that you
can't fool the computer. There were also two tests designed by
the staff, one in which I was requested to rank value statements
into groups of five (statements such as "Love is the most important
of all emotions"), and another in which I ranked a series
of rather more esoteric statements in terms of their meaningfulness
to me (such as "Behold, I am come home unto myself").


There followed four sessions, spaced a week apart, using a
gas called carbogen, which is a combination of 70% oxygen and
30% carbon dioxide. It is administered through a mask and at
first causes very rapid, difficult breathing, almost hyperventilation.

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

These carbogen sessions were frightening and dramatic, explosive
in their impact. The gas had its effect almost immediately,
and it was like bursting into a room inside myself of which
I had previously been completely unaware. My eyes were closed,
but I "saw" visual images of startling clarity, and I became totally
involved with what I saw, frequently crying and moaning,
and sometimes laughing with the carefree abandon of a child.
With each session, more doors were opened, more rooms revealed.
The emotions I felt were intense, and I was unable to
restrain my weeping or my screaming or my joy.


During the very first session, I experienced what mystics have
called the "eye of God." It was just that: an eye, looking at me.
And it was terrifying, for it could see everything there was to
see about me, all my faults and ugliness and the secret rottenness
that I didn't want to acknowledge. I was afraid of its judgment,
for I knew that my failings were far heavier on the scale
than my virtues. It was an eye that would never sleep, never
excuse, never forgive.


I acquired two important bits of knowledge about myself with
the aid of carbogen. The first concerned a fear of mine that was
so deep it would be called a phobia, I guess. It was a fear of
tubes. Not tunnels, but tubes too small to stand up in. In some
of the elementary schools I attended, the fire escapes from the
second floor were in the form of tubes, and I was so scared I
might have to go down one of these that, on days when there
were to be fire drills, I refused to go to school. Later, as an adult,
I went with Henry to the fun house at Coney Island, where
one could slide down a long, narrow, curving tube onto a revolving

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I discussed this fear with the psychologist, and he suggested
that I try to imagine going through the tube while under the
influence of carbogen. I was very frightened, but agreed to try.
Almost at once, I found myself inside a dark but roomy place.
It was lined with some soft, spongy material, and I was very
contented to be there, chuckling and humming, curled in the
fetal position. I did not actually experience emerging from the
"tube," but I did feel that someone picked me up by the ankles.
In retrospect, I believe that I was remembering my mother's
womb and that my fear of tubes represented a fear of being
born. Birth may be hard on the mother, but it's hard on the baby,
too.


My other significant experience also concerned babies. Up until
that time, I had never been pregnant, and, as I was approaching
forty, I thought I would probably never have a child. I felt
sad about this, and discussed it with the psychologist. He asked
me to "image" a baby as I inhaled the gas. This I did, but the
image of the baby quickly became white and shapeless and faded
away. Then I saw a pattern of wriggly black lines, like tiny tadpoles,
on a pure white background. They were in motion, going
toward an egg-shaped, colorless object which had a kind of fringe
around it, like eyelashes, acting as a protective barrier. I cradled
my cheek against my hand and said, "Lots of little ones, lots of
little ones, oh so many."


This may sound far out, but I believe the tiny tadpoles represented
sperm cells and the egg-shaped object was a female ovum,
namely mine, which was rejecting the sperm. Further, I believe
my internalization of my mother's fear of pregnancy literally

But opening the doors to the unconscious is a tricky and sometimes
dangerous business. After the third carbogen session, my
"eye" began to haunt me. I saw it in the folds of my bedclothes
when I settled down to go to sleep. I saw it when I closed my
eyes in the shower, and it continued to frighten me. During my
final CO-2 session, I saw a vision of a woman, and I knew her,
knew her not as a person but as a profound being, a cosmic
symbol. She was the ultimate woman, the divine mother. "I
know you," I said when I saw her. "<i>I know you</i>. I KNOW YOU."
The experimenters felt then that I was ready for LSD, which
would extend the experiences I had been having with carbogen,
and they scheduled my LSD session for the following week.


But I began having hallucinations ahead of schedule. Trees
took on weird, threatening shapes at night, and I could not sleep.
I became frightened and talked to the psychologist on the phone.
In the circumstances, he questioned the advisability of my proceeding
with the experiment, but we decided that I should come
on the designated day and we would see how things looked then.
On that day, as the hallucinations had not been repeated, we
elected to go ahead.


On the night before taking LSD, I was not allowed to take a
drug of any kind, including aspirin, and, of course, no alcohol.
I was very nervous. We were staying in a motel near Stanford,
and Dave and I walked around the block several times before
going to bed. I did not go to sleep for a long time, but lay looking
out of the window watching the traffic move along the
highway.


At eight o'clock the next morning, I was ushered into the
LSD-room, which was a large, pleasant room, furnished rather

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was given 200 micrograms of LSD, diluted in water. It was
presented to me in a small silver chalice, and I looked at it for
a long time before swallowing it. I lay down on the sofa and put
a sleep shade over my eyes. Through a pair of earphones I listened
to music from time to time, and some of the music
I heard on that day still affects me deeply. A microphone was
suspended around my neck, and everything I said was recorded
on tape (those tapes have since been destroyed). The psychologist
and the doctor who had been with me during the carbogen
sessions were again present, and remained with me all day. This
was important, as I had built up a strong trust with them, and
I was going to need that trust, for LSD sometimes induces paranoid
feelings.


It seemed a long time before anything happened, and when it
did, it was slow and gentle, quite unlike the abrupt and explosive
experience I had had with carbogen. The LSD experience
also had greater continuity, was less intense, lasted longer (eight
hours), and had more highs, more lows and more problems. In
the beginning, I sank into myself and my body withered and
died, but I did not find this frightening—my body was simply irrelevant.
There were the usual visual distortions: the rug moved
into great mounds, across which I could not possibly have
walked; the food brought in for lunch looked moldy and maggoty;
the rose I was given at the end of the day drooped and
died in my hand. My hearing became painfully acute, as did
my sense of touch. Several times, I caught a glimpse of a cat
in the room, and once I was convinced that my hair was on fire.


But all these things don't seem to be particularly meaningful,
except as they reflect on our definition of reality. Only two

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Here is a quotation, taken from the tape, of what I said while
I was deep in the experience: "I am so full of pain, my whole
bosom is one mass of pain. Every mother ... I am all mothers
(weeps) ... (sobbing) It is my pain for being a woman. I bleed
for all women. I love for all women, too. I am my own mother.
My thorn is her thorn, too. It is the thorn of all mothers for
their children, for all of mankind. It's all right to be the mother
of ants and scarabs and things, too. (moans and sighs) ... and
all us little cats, too."


The "thorn" stayed with me for several years, a sharp needle-like
pain near my heart which fluctuated in intensity. Electro-cardiograms
failed to give any explanation, but gradually the
pain lessened and finally it faded away altogether. I never did
understand what it meant.


If I had to summarize my peak experience in one sentence, I
would say: "Behold, I am Woman." Prior to taking LSD, I disliked
women. I found them tiresome, trivial, bitchy and boring.
I found nothing enobling in womanhood, not even the capacity
to be a mother—especially not that capacity, for my own mother
had nothing noble about her. I resented the physiological aspects

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That problem was resolved, but a second problem persisted:
my relationship with Dave. During the carbogen sessions, I had
spoken of him in terms of lyrical love. Under the influence of
LSD, although I remembered the love, I also hated, and spoke of
Dave in the vilest language I could think of. When I looked at
his picture (a publicity photograph), I tore off the autograph
(which was his nom de plume) and called him a homosexual
because of the green eye-shadow I saw in his eyelids. I kept saying,
"We shouldn't have married; it was a mistake; it was
wrong." I felt our marriage was wrong in some vitally essential
way, like sin. But I could not understand why I felt it was so
wrong, or what I could do about it, and I felt a great anguish
at the extent of my hatred for him.


About three o'clock in the afternoon, I asked if Dave could
come to see me, and within a short time, he was there. As soon
as I saw him, I was filled with joy and love. We embraced, and
I said, "You, my rum-soaked raggle-taggle pirate, you, my devil,
you are the thorn in my heart and you love me anyway." When
I studied his face, it became frightened, and I wanted to still his
fear. Later, his face became one of the fierce, bloodthirsty gods
of Central America, painted with geometrical figures. Then it
became Freud and finally a little boy frightened of his father.
But none of this helped to resolve the ambivalence or the intensity
of my feelings for him.


We went back to the motel about five-thirty, having made an
appointment to return the following afternoon for a recapitulation.
There were friends waiting for us, and we sat up and talked
and drank until quite late. The next morning, I awoke feeling
more joyful than I had ever felt in my life. I announced that

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the following day, we went home. My euphoria lasted
about a week, although I began to have trouble sleeping. I had
anticipated some difficulties in adjusting to the "newness" of
the world around me, but I felt sure of two things: 1) that if
Dave were just patient enough, I would become the best wife
he had ever had, and 2) that I would never commit suicide. Today,
ten years later, Dave worries about me constantly, and in
the past year and a half, I have made three serious suicide attempts
and have been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons four
times.


After I took LSD, I said to myself: Now I am a new person;
many things have been revealed to me; I understand myself and
others better; I shall be able to handle problems more intelligently,
more calmly; I shall be more mature. On repeating the
tests I had taken before LSD, the statement, behold, I am come
home unto myself," seemed particularly significant.


The year following the LSD-trip was one of the worst in my
life. I never knew when I would start hallucinating, and the
hallucinations terrified me; I could not sleep without a light
burning somewhere nearby; often I could not sleep at all, because
I was afraid the evil part of me would take control and kill
Dave. When I did sleep, I conducted long, audible conversations
with Dave (who was awake and thought that I was awake, too),
which I did not remember in the morning. In those conversations,
I would frequently discuss things I did not know I knew
—Tiresias, for example, or Beardsley. I felt completely fragmented

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had a series of dreams in which I was a pair of twins, sometimes
male and sometimes female. In every case, one of the
twins was virtuous and stupid and the other was brilliant and
evil. I identified with the virtuous one, but the evil one was always
the stronger. We performed terrible crimes together—kidnapping,
murder, dismembering infants. Finally, in the last of
the dreams, the twins were Siamese, and I realized that we shared
the same bloodstream, that we were two parts of a whole, two
sides of a coin. Today, I still wish I could unite the brilliance
and the virtue and push the stupidity and the evil under the
rug, but I guess that is not possible.


For several months, I struggled with these occurrences as best
I could, discussing them frequently with the psychologist or doctor
who had been with me when I took LSD. I felt ashamed and
inadequate because I could not tolerate the hallucinations, could
not learn from them the way others had done. I felt only terror—
panic, really. I was subject to attacks of sudden, overwhelming
fear that washed over me and made me want to run and hide,
but I had no place to run to.


Thus, it was finally decided that I had best be under the care
of the psychiatrist who was in charge of the experiment. He put
me on tranquilizers and met with me weekly for about six
months, until he had to return to the East. He had been working
with LSD for years and believed firmly in the learning possibilities
it provides. At the same time, he recognized when it was
necessary to put the lid on, and he helped me reestablish the
boundaries between conscious and unconscious.


Interestingly enough, at no time during this period did I consider
suicide. If there were a suicidal growth burgeoning in my
unconscious, why did it not spring fotrh then? For that was a
period of horrors, fears, hallucinations, nightmares. But I knew
all that time that I could put out my hand and Dave would be

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Some two years after I took LSD, I was alone in the house and
felt that I was ovulating. I could usually identify the process by
a certain uterine heaviness. This time, for some reason, it frightened
me, and I resolved to be careful and avoid sexual intercourse
that night. Then I realized what the fear meant—I was
afraid of becoming pregnant. I felt intensely ashamed. After all,
I thought, a woman's purpose was to bear children; it was not
something I should be afraid of.


A month or two later, I confessed all of this to Dave, and
speaking the words aloud must have represented a kind of yielding
on my part, for the following month we discovered that I
was pregnant. "But I've never been pregnant before," I protested
to the obstetrician. "There's always a first time," he replied
sagely. The baby was born in December, and his coming shifted
the focus of our life-style. Instead of renting houses, we bought
one; instead of taking off on a trip at a moment's notice, we became
sedentary, content to watch this new being, this product
of our lives, as he grew and changed. For me, who had written
hundreds of poems, he was a new kind of poem, and I learned
a new kind of love. I held him in my arms for long hours,
warmed and confirmed by his presence.


What terrible things have I done to that love, to that child
of my womb? My body instinctively knew how to care for him,
but I have betrayed that knowledge and instead of nurturing, I
am destroying him. My child, my child, conceived in beauty
and carried in joy, I cannot move now without harming you.
The question is which move will harm you least. Would you
not be infinitely benefitted if I gave you a new beginning? Whatever
I do, you will never be able to forgive me.


In September, before the baby was born, my husband had to
undergo emergency surgery for a diseased gall bladder. Although
it did not show up on X-rays, a gallstone was also suspected, and
the surgeon had to search for it while Dave was under anesthesia.
The fact that something like this could happen to Dave,

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Together with this erosion went the fear that he would die,
for a friend of ours had died in similar circumstances when, during
gall bladder surgery, it was discovered that his inner organs
were a mass of cancer cells. I could not sleep the night before
the surgery because, in my customary way of romanticizing
events, I was afraid I would have to give a life for a life—Dave's
life for the life in my womb.


The surgery on Dave was successful. The gallstone was found
and mounted in plastic for us to put on our knick-knack shelf,
and Dave came home almost as good as new. But my love
for him bore a scar as disfiguring as the one on his body.


Another factor eroding our relationship was Dave's recurrent
attacks of hiccups. Shortly after we were married, he began to
have occasional bouts of hiccuping, mild at first and easily
stopped with water or alcohol. As time went by, these attacks
increased in frequency and intensity until they were almost a
daily occurrence. They were not like the hiccups one reads about
in the newspaper in which the victim hiccups incessantly, day
and night, unable to sleep or eat. Dave was usually able to stop
his hiccups with a drink of water; the problem was that they
would start again in fifteen minutes or half an hour or an hour,
depending upon how lucky he was that day. Also, he was almost
always able to gain relief by lying down.


Over the years, the hiccups have become an intrinsic part of
our lives and a source of antagonism between us. Once again,
Dave has proved he is not invulnerable. Moreover, the fact that
the hiccups started shortly after we were married indicates to
me that he is still harboring guilt feelings about leaving his wife
and daughter. In other words, it is all my fault. If he had not
married me, he would be growing old in comfort and security,

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Incidentally, if you have a hiccup remedy, please don't send it
to us. We have tried them all, from folk remedies such as drinking
a glass of water upside down or breathing into a paper bag
to sophisticated methods such as running a plastic tube down
one nostril and tickling the pharynx. Dave has also tried chiropractic,
hypnosis and acupuncture with no long-term benefit. In
some cases, it is possible to stop hiccups by severing a nerve
which runs from the diaphragm up through the back of the
neck. There are two of these nerves, one on each side, and one
can apparently be severed without causing any harm. It has
been established, however, that Dave hiccups on both sides,
making that procedure impossible.


So the hiccups arrive every day, sometimes in the morning,
sometimes at noon, sometimes not until four o'clock. Sometimes
they are so harsh they seem about to strangle him; other
times they are gentle and slide away easily with a glass of water.
Once they have started, they last until he goes to bed and
sometimes they last all night, in which case he takes in so much
fluid that he regurgitates everything. His medication combines a
tranquilizer and an anti-depressant, and although it does not stop
the hiccups altogether, it helps, for without it Dave hiccups
constantly.


I have no compassion for these hiccups and am barely able
to tolerate them. They jar me with their alien rhythm and
throw the environment slightly off center like a picture hanging
crooked. I'm not sure whether it's the picture or the room which
needs straightening. In the first place, Dave's hiccups are my
fault for marrying him. In the second place, if he were the man
he was supposed to be, he would not have them in the first
place. In the third place, they have deprived him of his vitality,
his interesting-ness, his ability to write, his ability to talk to
people, his interest in doing anything whatsover except sit in
his chair and smoke and occasionally read a newspaper. He says

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I guess that represents the difference between my point of
view and his. Dave feels that suicide is depraved, and a lot of
people would agree with him. I don't feel it is depraved, I think
it's logical; when it's time to go, it's time to go.


I read an article the other day about a man who makes pottery
out of the ashes of cremated humans mixed with clay, and
I thought that was a lovely idea; I hope someone will do that
with my ashes. Perhaps I do want to be remembered a little. "See
that vase over there? It's made out of my mother." The only
way I can have an impact on life is by dying.


I first started getting sick when our son was just under two
years old. I was tired all of the time, I had dizzy spells, I wasn't
interested in anything. My internist ran me through the usual
battery of tests and the only thing he could find wrong with
me was high blood pressure—not alarmingly high and amenable
to medication. So every couple of months, I went in and had my
blood pressure checked, but I still did not feel any better. Finally
he said, "I think you're depressed." "That's silly," I said, "what
do I have to be depressed about?" He shrugged his shoulders,
gave me a bottle of capsules, and said, "Try these. See if they
make any difference."


They did make a difference, and the next time the doctor saw
me, he said, "I think you should see a psychiatrist." "No thanks,"
I said vehemently, all my old fears of psychiatrists and hospitals
returning in a rush. After all, I reasoned, my experience with
the psychiatrist after LSD had been under special circumstances;
any ordinary psychiatrist would probably stick me in a hospital
first thing. "Well," my doctor said, "I can't go on giving you
these drugs because I don't know enough about them and their
side effects."

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So I went home in tears, more depressed than ever, and when
Dave asked me what was wrong, I said, "Nothing. That's just
the trouble."


Dave finally became so concerned that he went to see the internist,
and between the two of them they set up an appointment
for me to see a psychiatrist. When I was presented with
this <i>fait accompli</i>, I agreed, but on two conditions: 1) that
he would not toss me into a hospital, and 2) that I would like
him. The psychiatrist I met that day made me feel comfortable
and relaxed; he understood my fear of hospitals, and he cared.
I was amused that one of the first things he had me do was take
the same old MMPI test for the third time. Unlike the other doctors,
however, he shared the results with me.


I consulted the psychiatrist for about a year and a half, and as
it became apparent that at least some part of my problem arose
from my relationship with Dave, we had joint sessions for several
months. Dave, however, although he favored psychiatric
treatment for me, did not feel it would help him or the two of
us together, and did not cooperate. Perhaps he could not. At any
rate, this left the psychiatrist with no place to go, and the sessions
were terminated.


I managed to get along pretty well for several years on a
maintenance dose of an antidepressant, but then all of my former
symptoms reappeared, and once again I showed up in my
internist's office. It was a different doctor this time, because my
former doctor had died in the interim. The new man could find
nothing out of order with my blood pressure, but he found
things definitely askew with my liver, which he attributed to my
heavy drinking.


Alcohol, of course, was the way I kept myself going. I started
drinking in New York where all those beautiful ads that you
see on TV and in magazines could not possibly be put together
without a martini in hand. For Dave and me, it was an integral
part of the day. We had a couple of drinks before lunch and, if
we had guests, wine with lunch. Cocktail time started at four

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The doctor urged me to cut down to two drinks a day, and
for a while I did, so that my next liver test turned up normal.
However, my depression increased, and it wasn't long before the
internist asked me when I had last seen the psychiatrist. "About
three years," I said, and he suggested that I reestablish contact.


The first question the psychiatrist asked me was whether or
not anything had changed in my life since the last time he had
seen me. No, I told him. Then he said my depression was of a
cyclic nature and that this had probably been true all of my
adult life and might have accounted for some of my attempts
at suicide. He told me of a new drug called lithium, which had
proven extremely useful in the treatment of manic-depressives
and was sometimes helpful in the treatment of depressives, although
it could not be used effectively until the depressed person
had recovered somewhat. He said he hoped to be able to
use this drug for me, but that, in the meantime, we would have
to proceed in other directions—antidepressants, sleeping pills,
therapy.


Perhaps it was being told that my illness was cyclic, perhaps
it was the fear that I would not recover from the depression,
perhaps it was a desire for a dramatic change in my life style—
whatever the reason, my depression this time was much more
severe, and I became obsessed with the idea of suicide.


At home, I was almost incapacitated, accomplishing only those
things which were absolutely necessary. I remember the fall of
1972 as a nightmare cast in gray—first came Halloween and the
costume for my son; then came my birthday early in November;
then Thanksgiving when we were always joined by my sister;
early in December came my son's birthday and the required
party; and finally Christmas, with all the Christmas cards, the
presents, the tree, the decorations, the picture-taking, the parties.


I also became involved in volunteer activities, the idea being
that if I had something to do away from home, I might feel

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The day after Christmas, I told my psychiatrist that if he did
not put me in the hospital, I would commit suicide. He did not
want to hospitalize me, but my threat left him no alternative.
I had a small bottle of Seconal, which I then gave him, and I
entered the hospital that afternoon. He told me later that the
dosage would not have killed me, but that it would have caused
a lot of trouble.


I don't really know how I felt then. All I know is that I could
not go on living as I had been; all I was and everything I was
doing had become intolerable.


At this point, I am reminded of one of the experiences I had
while under the influence of LSD. I was cleaning out a septic
tank by hand, and I said, "Get it out, get it <i>all</i> out. No wonder
you're such a wretch with all this shit in here."


Well, I have come to the point in this book where I feel I
must get it all out, but I wonder whether that "all" will be of
any interest to anyone except me, for cathartic purposes, and
maybe a couple of psychiatrists who are studying what goes on
in the mind of a would-be suicide.


Right now, for example, at this very moment, I have a sufficient
quantity of pills in my medicine chest to kill myself.
Mind you, not just land in the Intensive Care Unit with tubes

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the other hand, I have a contract with Dave that I won't
commit suicide until I have finished this book. I also have a
similar contract with my doctor, but I don't think he believes in
it. Nonetheless, one of the reasons I have all of those pills is that
he gave them to me because he is going away for a week and
had to give me twice as many pills as he normally does. If I
kill myself, I can leave him with a nice, tidy little guilt feeling.
Well, I can say, he took a chance and he lost; that's the way the
cookie bounces. But can I swallow all those pills, plus the ones
I have stashed away for just such an opportunity as this, while
thinking of his office and the black leather chairs and the pictures
on the walls and the transference and the dependence and
all of the emotions that have been expressed within those four
walls? Can I say to him, "Go fuck yourself," like that? Can I?
Well, I've done it before—it just didn't come off.


And there's Dave. He won't be abe to handle it. I know that
from the one time I nearly died as a result of a suicide attempt.
The shock caused him to collapse, after I was "safe." He lost his
sense of balance and fell down the stairs, seriously cutting his
face and suffering a concussion. But he would last long enough
to see to it that our son was properly cared for.


Then, of course, there is our son. He is eight years old and
brilliant, very perceptive, tall, and good-looking. We quarrel a

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So shall I do it? The thought gives me so much pleasure. I
want to so much that it brings tears to my eyes. I could leave,
I could leave tonight and never have to come back. I wish I
could. I wish I could.


But I probably won't. There is still that tiny spark of life in me
that won't go out. I won't be dead tomorrow, but I'll wish I were.


So, back to the hospital where I went on that bleak day after
Christmas, 1972. It proved to be quite a different sort of place than
the one I inhabited when I was eighteen. It occupies a wing of
a modern, major hospital in our town, and is identified by the
word "Psychiatry" on the door, which normally is not locked.
There are no bars on the windows, but they cannot be opened
because of the heating/air conditioning system. The rooms are
like ordinary bedrooms with two beds to a room (not hospital
beds) and private bathrooms; there is a large living room with a
television set, stereo, and radio; in the dining room, the flatware
is not counted; the kitchen is equipped with stove, refrigerator,
sink, soft drinks, coffee urn, and so forth. The members of the
staff do not wear uniforms. Your own psychiatrist comes to see
you every day except Sunday.


There is group therapy once and sometimes twice a day, with
the groups kept small enough to allow for full participation.
Incidentally, I forgot to mention that men and women are housed
in the same unit. Dance therapy, physical therapy, outings to the
beach or concerts or movies are all available to the patients, and

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Not all patients are allowed the same privileges, of course.
Some are free to come and go at will, provided they sign in and
out and indicate where they are going. Others must be accompanied
by a staff member, and still others are not allowed to
leave the unit at all. On occasion, when a patient is greatly disturbed
and possibly dangerous to himself, the main door is locked
to insure that he stays in the unit. When checking in, each
patient's bags are examined for medications and potentially
harmful objects such as razor blades, which are confiscated.


Altogether, the unit has the atmosphere of a rest home rather
than a hospital, and I think that is the way I felt about it during
my first sojourn there, which lasted about three weeks. I was allowed
considerable freedom, spent every weekend at home, and
soon was discharged, feeling somewhat stronger.


All of my life I have written poetry, although I have never
tried to have any of it published. I usually throw it away or
give it away or lose it. When Dave and I first became lovers, he
urged me to write a book, which I did. It was called <i>Tenderly,
My Love</i>, and was essentially a long love poem. It was short on
plot and the characterizations were minimal, but the language
was beautiful. It received about six reviews, the most interesting
of which appeared in a small, midwest newspaper, calling the
book, "slime ... iridescent slime, but slime nonetheless." I always
thought that review would have made great publicity for
increased sales, but the publisher did not agree with me. The
reason, incidentally, the reviewer called the book "slime" was
that the love relationship was an adulterous one.


All of the poetry of love and joy and heartbreak and romance
that had been building up in me for thirty-odd years spilled out
in that book, which was essentially about me and Dave and our
love. As a book, it was a total commercial failure, but as an expression
of sensual feeling, it represented some kind of epitome
for me.

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After returning from the hospital in January, 1973, I began to
write a new kind of poetry, profuse and evocative, but on another
subject: death. During that period, I felt as if I were a
passenger on a ship of life, an unwilling, even an unreal passenger.
I did not know the ship's destination, nor did I wish to
know. I did not know the ship's other passengers, nor did I
wish to know. Perhaps some of them were potential suicides,
like me; perhaps some of them were brimming with a joy of
life—a life I could not endure; perhaps some of them were
merely passengers and didn't much care, just going along for
the ride, you might say. Whenever I felt myself to be one of
those passengers, I wanted to get off.


My feelings toward Dave reached a low point equivalent to
the high they had achieved when I wrote <i>Tenderly</i>. I felt that
I was married to a dead man, that he was no longer making any
contribution to our marriage, that he was rattling around inside
himself as I was rattling around inside myself, and that we no
longer had any communication.


I wrote extensively of the pain I felt, of the feeling that although
I might appear to be calm and capable on the surface,
inside I was insane. I have always feared that my psyche, by
which I mean the structure of my personality, was fragile, and
in those early months of 1973, my psyche began to crack. Worse,
I could not see any way of patching it, let alone making it whole.
I felt I had to sit quietly, holding it together, or it would break
apart, and all the ugly things in it would spill out all over the
floor.


On re-reading those poems, I find two things predominate. On
the one hand, I was fighting my suicidal impulses, trying to put
them down, push them aside. On the other, I felt that my interior
was so infested with malignancy that the world would be
better off without me.


I usually wrote the poems at night while I was trying to go to
sleep, and I read them to Dave in the morning over our several
cups of tea. Whether he recognized them for what they were, I

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On Sunday night, March 18th, I took an overdose of Fiorinal
and Chloral hydrate and was taken to the hospital and placed
in the psychiatric unit, apparently all right but unconscious.
During the night, the bottom fell out of my blood pressure, and
I was moved to the Intensive Care Unit where I remained for
about twelve hours. When I was returned to the psychiatric unit,
I was still not fully conscious and was equipped with a catheter
and a full-time special nurse. Despite the catheter, I continually
tried to get out of bed to go to the bathroom and usually fell
down. I was very much out of focus and could not answer
simple questions such as: "Where are you?" "What day of the
week is it?" "What month is it?" I remember looking out of the
window to see if there were any snow on the ground; in southern
California, that was not a very astute method of determining
the season. These interviews were conducted by my own psychiatrist,
and although I think I was able to identify him immediately,
it took me some time to identify the ring of keys he
held in his hand.


There was obviously some possibility of brain damage, and
as soon as I could be disconnected from the catheter and sit up
straight in a wheelchair, I was given an electroencephelograph
test. EEG for short. At first, I was terrified of having my brain
wired to a machine, as if some of the substance would be
drained off, but after having four EEGs, I decided they were, on
the whole, rather fun.


First of all, tiny clips joined to wires of many colors were
fastened to my scalp. They pinched a little at first, but then
there was no pain. The differently-colored wires were attached
to a recording device, and the attendant was attached to this
device, too. I mean by this that the attendant in this case was
so impassive she gave the impression of being just another little
wire.

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have forgotten the exact sequence of events, but it went something
like this: I lay down on the bed with a flat pillow under my
head and a light cover over my body. I was told to relax and
then to hold my eyes open, without blinking, until the attendant
gave a signal that it was all right to blink. This period of time
was longer than I could normally hold my eyes open without
blinking, and I was proud when I managed to do it, although I
could feel the strain of doing something unnatural. All of the
time, little gongs were ringing, pens were busily drawing lines
all over a large sheet of paper, and the attendant occupied herself
making notes and checkmarks here and there. My brain was
being recorded.


The eye-blinking test was repeated several times. Then I was
asked to close my eyes, and bright lights were flashed over them,
beginning very slowly and increasing in speed until they were
flashing extremely rapidly. What was interesting about this test
were the colors I saw. At first, there was an ordinary white
light, but as the flashing increased in speed, the colors changed,
settling into predominantly one color or another, although the
color of the light itself was always the same. The first time I was
given the test, I think the color I saw was primarily blue, but it
was different in each test. Whether or not that had anything to
do with the condition of my brain, I do not know. The net effect
was one of exhilaration. However, in another part of the
test, I was asked to hyperventilate (breathe very rapidly), which
made me cold and dizzy, and that was the end of the exhilaration.


(Now, for those of you who tuned in for today's episode, you
will note that I did not commit suicide last night. The spark
of life may have had something to do with it, but there was also
the fact that the doctor did not after all provide me with
enough pills to do the job. He made a mistake, a miscalculation,
based, perhaps, on his own reluctance to knowingly supply me
with the wherewithal for death. It's too bad, really, for now I'll
never know whether I would have taken them.)

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My first EEG indicated that all was not right with my brain,
but a week later I scored normal. "No scrambled brains," said
the doctor. Later, when a high-powered antidepressant brought
undesirable side effects, a third EEG gave an abnormal reading.
After a week without the troublesome drug, however, the EEG
report was "within the normal range," which I suppose is something
to cheer about. My mind doesn't seem to function "within
the normal range."


This time I was in the hospital for two months and came to
know the place pretty well. I grew bold enough to participate in
group therapy, and I learned to paint—I, who had never held a
paint brush in my hand and firmly believed I could not draw.
I became so entranced with painting that I later took evening
classes. I had days of despair and days of calm, following the
routine without protest, as obedient as ever. In the beginning,
my activities were restricted, but as time went by I was given
more and more freedom until I had lunch dates two or three
times a week outside the hospital. But no matter how socially
active I might be, the hospital was my base and represented
safety. There, I could try to learn to cope with my interior
stresses without, at the same time, having to cope with problems
imposed from outside. If, now and then, I felt brave enough to
emerge into the outside world, it was with the knowledge that
the hospital was always available as a retreat.


It seems, in my case at least, that acute depression must be
accompanied by some physical problem. On the previous occasion,
it had been my ear; this time, I developed arthritis in my
neck so severe at times that I could not hold my head straight.
It was treated with traction and massage and improved greatly
during my hospitalization, as I guess my state of mind did, too.


I remember many faces from those eight weeks, many voices,
many scenes. I do not recall a single instance of indifference on
the part of the staff, and I remember many when I received the
warmth and understanding and generosity I needed. For the
first time in my life, outside the psychiatrist's office, to be mentally

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was discharged in the middle of May, resolved, if not prepared,
to give some coherence to my life. Dave and I agreed to
participate in something we called "family therapy," for want of
a better name, with two members of the hospital staff, and we
began meeting with them weekly. During my absence, our son had
refused to visit any of his friends at their homes, confessing he
was afraid something might happen to his father while he was
away and then he would be truly an orphan. It took him some
time to get over this fear, but by the middle of June, we were
able to leave him with some old friends while we took a short
trip. I am afraid this trip did not improve my mood much, for a
poem I wrote then states: "It is sad to live," and "God weeps
that I cannot die."


My sister visited us that spring and again later. I wish I could
include here the many times I talked with her, the many times
she soothed me, the many times she listened to my despair, my
fear and my forsakeness. Seventeen years younger than I, she is
in many ways much wiser.


I spent much of the summer at the beach, usually with my
son and one or more of his playmates. As I sat on the sand,
sounds floated past without touching me and my presence sifted
away into the sea. The sea was my mother, my torment and my
peace, and I longed to be united with it. I tried to express this
feeling in my paintings and poetry.


The poems I wrote that summer contain a growing message
of helplessness, a feeling of not being present, of being lost somewhere
in the fog with no trail to follow and no clues to guide me.
I did not struggle as hard against suicidal feelings as I had previously,
for I felt I was already partly obliterated. "I am here,"

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But one day I discovered that "someone" was <i>not</i> "looking
at me." It was dramatic and frightening, and it came about as a
by-product of psychotherapy. For as long as I could remember, I
had had the feeling of being watched. I cannot say whether this
feeling came from the idea of God, who notes even the falling
sparrow, or from the idea that my mother always knew what I
was doing, especially when it was wrong. Whatever the reason,
it was a very strong feeling and often affected the way I behaved.
No, I would say to myself, I mustn't do that for someone is
watching. Or, Did my watcher notice how expertly I parked the
car?


This was not the watcher spoken of as a witness in some religious
doctrines. That witness does not judge. My watcher was
always identified as a specific individual, someone I had known
in the past, who was following my movements by means of
some mechanical device. And, of course, my watcher judged.


One day that summer I realized I wasn't being watched any
more. It gave me a strange feeling, partly freedom and partly
loneliness, raising the question of who was the watcher and who
was the watched. I grew afraid; I thought that if no one was
watching, it was because there was nothing to watch. Inside, I
was empty. People like my psychiatrist were looking for whatever
was inside me and it was all a huge joke; there was nothing
there.


It's true, too; I am empty. I have nothing inside, nothing to
give, nothing to say. I sat on the patio one day recently having
drinks with my husband and I said, "I don't love you. It is impossible
for me to love anyone now." As for my son, I do not
deserve to love him. Not only am I unworthy of his love, but I
am also unworthy of feeling the beauty of loving him. To love
is to give, and I can give nothing because I have nothing, I am
nothing. Any gift I offer would be as empty of meaning as I am.


During those summer months, my husband was in charge of
my medication. He carried it around in his pocket in the daytime,

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Once again, an ambulance carted me off to the hospital, where
it was met by my therapist and my medical doctor. I was immediately
placed in a respirator in the Intensive Care Unit and
equipped with intravenous feeding tubes and catheters and I
don't know what else. For three days I remained in a coma, but
on the fourth day I was transferred from ICU to the medical
unit, complete with catheters, IV's and around-the-clock nursing.
When I woke up, it was just like waking from a long sleep and
I felt curiously refreshed and completely unaware of the activity
that had been going on around me. Because of the drug involved
(Triavil), I had none of the previous drifting in and out of consciousness,
none of the struggle to relate to the present. The first
time I was conscious of seeing my psychiatrist, I said brightly,
"That's a key ring."


This was the suicide attempt which threw Dave into shock.
Apparently he managed all right for the first few days, but by
the time the neighbors found out what was going on and my
sister was able to come, his sense of balance was so askew that
he could hardly walk across the room. On Saturday, September
22nd, he fell down the stairs from the second floor to the first,
cutting his face badly and suffering a concussion. Now it was
his turn to be taken to Intensive Care.


The cut was a deep one, going through his eyebrow and down
his nose, but the surgeon who repaired it did a masterly job, for
today the scar is not discernible. No reason could be found for
Dave's loss of equilibrium, other than shock, and he was moved

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By the time this accident occurred, I was in the psychiatric
unit, still watched over by special nurses, but something had
to be done about caring for our son, as my sister could not remain
with us indefinitely. I discussed the problem with my psychiatrist,
and we agreed that, as I was functioning fairly normally,
I would return home and go into intensive psychotherapy
(daily meetings) rather than remain in the hospital. "I feel like
Miss Shit-ass of 1973," I declared.


Dave returned home at the end of the week, and we were
now heading into the Fall merry-go-round, beginning with the
school fair, then Halloween, my birthday, Thanksgiving, our son's
birthday and Christmas. I dreaded the whole thing, but this year
it was to be different. I bought very few presents and wrote no
Christmas letters, which was a relief, for Christmas letters are
supposed to be full of joy and cheer, and I had none of those
things in me, not anywhere at all. I despised Christmas for forcing
me to put on a false face. We spent the Christmas holidays
in the East with Dave's daughter and her family and her mother.
It was our son's first experience with snow, and a refreshing
change for all of us.


During that fall I was also occupied with yoga classes and
my class in painting. Another occupation was wine, much to
the distress of my psychiatrist, because, on occasion, after a certain
amount of wine, I became suicidal. The psychiatrist asked
me not to drink so much, and I agreed, but drank so much
anyway, which he regarded as a breach of trust, which I guess it
was. It was also an example of my inclination to cross barriers
that are set up in front of me.


When we returned from our Christmas holiday, I found that
nothing had changed and life would go on as before. I would get
up at six-thirty to get our son ready for school and drive him to
meet his school bus. Then I would return home, practice my
yoga exercises, drink my tea and read the paper. The day died
right there.

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Everything I did was done from the bottom of the place where
I lived, where one was never concerned about the weather and
where no one ever came to visit because there was no way to
get there. When anyone touched me; it was through a kind of
veil, and conversation took place through this veil, too. The only
real communication was tears—"I start my day with a washing,"
I wrote—and nobody seemed to understand these. The only real
feeling was pain which could only be assuaged with wine.


I felt completely unrelated to what I was doing and what was
going on around me, and the desire for death was once again
uppermost in my mind. I wrote of my hope for death, my eagerness
for it, as if death were my lover, calling to me from the
middle of some forest, the bottom of some sea. It should be easy
to die. People die all the time, quickly, suddenly, softly. Is it always
so hard? Is that final moment, that final breakthrough always
so difficult to achieve? I longed for a split second of complete
insanity, just long enough to open the vein, fire the gun,
drive the car off the road.


Since the previous September, the psychiatrist had been in
charge of my medication, giving me only the pills I needed
from one visit to the next. Therefore, on the 28th of January, I
told him of my new suicide plan, which did not require pills.
I would take the vacuum cleaner hose, hook it onto the exhaust
pipe of the car, run it in through the car's rear window, and turn
on the motor. Then I would sit in the back seat with a bottle or
two of wine and go to sleep, hopefully for the last time. I told
the doctor I had tested this and it would work, and he told me
he was putting me back in the hospital, probably for electrotherapy.


Electrotherapy. Electric shock treatments. I recoiled. My psychiatrist
and I had discussed this possibility before, and I knew
he considered them a last resort for me, a kind of therapeutic
sledgehammer. In the hospital, they are referred to as ECT for
Electro-Convulsive Therapy, but they no longer cause convulsions,
nor are they as dangerous as they once were. Nobody

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus, in February 1974, I found myself in the hospital again.
I was interviewed by the electrotherapist, a psychiatrist specially
trained in this field, and he agreed I might benefit from the
treatments. On the morning of the first treatment, the nurse
came in at six-thirty and gave me an injection of atropine to
dry up bodily fluids. At seven, I was taken to the treatment
room, where I lay down on a flat table. The electrotherapist, a
large, genial man, smiled as if he were about to invite me to a
dance and slid a needle into my arm. His assistant slid a mouthpiece
into my mouth to keep me from biting my tongue, and I
was given sodium pentothal, which put me to sleep in short
order. The "shock" was administered at my temples, but I was
aware of nothing more until I was back in my own bed.


When I woke up, I had a terrible headache,; I did not know
where I was or who I was; I did not recognize my roommate or
my room. I did, however, recognize my psychiatrist, who was
sitting beside the bed. I told him I would rather be dead than
feel like this. I was terribly thirsty and was given a glass of water
and some codeine for my headache and went back to sleep.
When I reawakened, it was about eleven-thirty and I felt better
—more in focus.


My reaction was not quite as bad to subsequent treatments
(they were given three times a week), but I nearly always had an
intense headache and frequently slept late, which, I was told,
was a good sign.


One of the side effects of electrotherapy is amnesia, the severity
of which varies with each individual. No one can predict
how long the amnesia will last or how extensive it will be, nor
can anyone say whether or not it is related to emotional factors.
In my case, it was not too much of a problem and to a large
extent has faded.


After eight electrotherapy treatments, I was given permission
to spend the week-end at home. My psychiatrist tells me we

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My son had a friend over to spend the night, and they were
sleeping in the guest room which is quite near the garage, but
the master bedroom, where Dave was sleeping, is on the other
side of the house. At about twelve-thirty that night, I attached
the vacuum cleaner hose to the exhaust pipe and ran it, with
one wand attached, through the rear window, lowered just far
enough to accommodate it, into the car. Then I turned on the
motor and climbed into the back seat with half a bottle of wine
and some rum. I sat there rather happily drinking wine while
the exhaust emission burned my arm so badly that I still have
a mark.


At some point, I became concerned that the boys might hear
the noise of the car motor and either come and investigate or
report the matter to Dave, so I drove the car out of the garage.
At some point, too, the exhaust emission burned a hole in the
hose, so that no more carbon monoxide was coming into the
car. From the time I left the garage, my memories of that night
are kaleidoscopic. I remember bright lights and a montage of
faces, all of whom were extraordinarily friendly. After a while, I
blacked out entirely, and when I regained consciousness, I was
in my own bed at home with a horrendous headache and no
idea of how I got there.


Dave tells me that he woke up at two o'clock or two-thirty
and when he saw that I was not in bed, he looked for me
through the house, finally discovering that the car, too, was gone.
He called the psychiatrist, who told him to call the police, which
he did. We live in the country, but after some time, the city police
called to tell him that they had found me and were bringing
me home. I was wearing only a nightgown and a robe, had no
identification or driver's license, and furthermore had an open
bottle of rum in the car. Why I was not arrested, I don't know,

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dave returned me to the hospital that Sunday. My psychiatrist
was furious, but did not abandon me, as I was afraid he might.
And I had another unsuccessful suicide atempt to add to my
record. In fact, my son has commented that he doesn't mind if
I try to commit suicide as long as I don't succeed. The question
arises as to whether my failures are deliberate. I leave the empty
bottles lying around so that the drugs I have taken can be
quickly identified. I leave myself lying around so that I will be
found in time to have my life saved. I telegraph my intentions
so that I can be stopped. My psychiatrist tells me that people
who really intend to commit suicide do so, but here we are,
talking to each other. And here I am, writing a book about it.


So there must be a will to live within me, a force strong
enough to defeat death at every encounter. The problem is how
to resolve the ambivalence, how to make the coin come up
heads. I yearn for death, as this book records, but when I try to
die, I fail. And every time I fail, I say, Next time I'll succeed.
I must learn to set aside the words, "Next time." I must start
trying to live instead of trying to die.


To this end, I am taking Antabuse so that I can no longer
drink. I occupy myself with yoga lessons, because they make
my body feel good. I paint, because it is exciting to work with
my new-found sense of color. I work part-time for a small, weekly
newspaper, which is fun because the staff is young, enthusiastic
and full of vitality. And when despair threatens my sanity, I
try to cool it by finding someone to talk to, or by writing it down,
or by listening to the sea. And twice a week, I see my friend, the
therapist.


Some day again, perhaps I shall be able to say, "Behold, I am
come home unto myself."
