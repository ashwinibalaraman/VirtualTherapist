LINDA COGSWELL: INITIAL INTAKE NOTES


<i>Ms. Cogswell is a thirty-seven-year-old swf who has
had over thirty hospitalizations, all for suicide
attempts or self-mutilation. She scratches her arms
lightly when upset. Was extensively sexually abused
as a child. Is now requesting outpatient therapy for
bulimia. Ms. Cogswell says she's vomiting multiple
times during the day. Teeth are yellowed and rotting,
probably due to stomach acids present during purges</i>.


<i>Client has been in outpatient therapy with over seventy
(!) social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists.
She has "fired" them all because she cannot
tolerate their limit-setting. She has threatened to sue
"at least eight, maybe more," because "they never
gave me what I needed. They were a menace to the
profession." Please note: Client has never carried
through with any of her threats to sue. She does, however</i>,

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00194&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>During her intake and evaluation appointment,
client presented as teary and soft-spoken. She wore
large hoop earrings and much makeup. She said she
believes she has gout and asked to be prescribed medication
for it. Became belligerent when refused. Possibly
this client is delusional, although she was fully
oriented to all three spheres—person, place, and
time—knowing who and where she was, and demonstrating
capacity to locate historical figures in their
appropriate periods. Proverb interpretation: somewhat
concrete. Serial sevens: intact</i>. Recommendation:
<i>psychological testing; 1x weekly behavioral
therapy to address eating disorder; possible admission
as an inpatient if she cannot get bulimia under
control</i>.


"So who wants to take the case?" asks Dr. Siley, the
director of both the inpatient and outpatient facilities
where I work. He folds the initial intake evaluation
from which he's been reading back into its green file.


None of the other clinicians offer. A woman as outrageously
demanding and consistently suicidal as this

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What about you?" Dr. Siley says, looking in my
direction. He knows my numbers are down. My job
description states I'm responsible for seeing at least
twenty in his outpatient clinic, in addition to the
chronic schizophrenics in his residential program.


"Well," I say, "she sounds like a lot of work."


"Who isn't?" Veronica says.


"Why don't you take her, then?" I say.


"I'm full," Veronica says.


"And you aren't," Dr. Siley adds, pushing the file
across the table toward me.


The phone rings six, maybe seven times, and then I
hear a tiny voice on the other end—"Hello," it whispers,
and I announce myself, the new therapist, let's
make an appointment, look forward to meeting you,
here's where the clinic is, in case you forgot—


"Can't," the voice weeps. "Can't, can't." I hear the
sound of choking, the rustle of plastic. "Ten times a
day," the voice says. "Into thirty-three gallon bags.
I've spent"—and sobbing breaks out over the line—
"I've spent every last penny on frozen pizzas. There's
blood coming up now."


"You need to be in a hospital, then," I say.

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00196&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Oh, please," the voice cries. "Put me in a hospital
before I kill myself. I'm afraid I'm going to kill myself."


I tell her to sit tight, hang on, and then I replace the
receiver. I know the routine by heart. I call 911, give
the ambulance company her name and address, tell
them there's no need to commit her because she said
she'd go willingly. Next they'll take her to an emergency
room, and after that she'll be placed on an inpatient
unit somewhere in the state. She can't come into
our own program's inpatient unit because she's neither
schizophrenic nor male, the two criteria for admission.
She'll stay wherever she is put anywhere from
three days to four weeks, enough time, probably, for
her to forget I ever called, to forget she ever wandered
into the clinic where I work. At the hospital they'll
likely set her up with an aftercare psychologist affiliated
with their own institution, and he or she will have
to deal with what sounds like her enormous neediness.
And I, lucky I, will be off the case. Or so I think.


Two days later a call comes through to my office.
"Ms. Linda Cogswell tells us you're her outpatient
therapist. Could you come in for a team meeting next
Monday afternoon?"


"Well, I don't even know her, actually. I was
assigned the case, but before I could meet her she had
to be hospitalized. Where is she?"

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00197&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Mount Vernon. I'm her attending psychologist
here. Would you be willing to meet with us regarding
her aftercare plans?"


<i>Mount Vernon, Mount Vernon</i>. And suddenly, even
though it's been years, I see the place perfectly all over
again, the brick buildings, the green ivy swarming the
windows. The nurses who floated down the halls like
flocks of seagulls, carrying needles in their beaks. My
heart quickens; a screw tightens in my throat.


"Mount Vernon?" I say. Of all the hundreds of hospitals
in Massachusetts, why did it have to be <i>this</i>
one? And another part of me thinks I should have
been prepared, for eventually past meets present;
ghosts slither through all sealed spaces.


"Look, I don't know the woman at all," I repeat, and
I hear something desperate in my voice. I try to tamp it
down, assume a professional pose. "I mean, the patient,
although technically assigned to me, has not begun a
formal course of psychotherapy under my care."


A pause on the line. "But <i>technically</i>," the voice
retorts, "she is under your care, yes? You have some
sort of record on her? Your clinic agreed to take the
case?"


"Yes," I say. "Well ... yes."


"Next Monday, then, one o'clock, North—"


"Two," I interrupt bitterly. "North Two."


"Good," she says. "We'll see you then."

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00198&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What else can I do? Technically, I <i>have</i> been
assigned the case. But this isn't any longer about the
case; my hesitations now don't have to do with Linda
Cogswell and her stained teeth, but with ivy on the
brick, the shadow of a nurse, a needle, the way night
looked as it fell beyond the bars and the stars were
sliced into even segments. I remember looking out the
windows on North Two; I remember Rosemary swallowing
her hidden pills, how she danced the Demerol
onto her tongue and later sank into a sleep so deep
only the slamming cuffs of a cardiac machine could
rouse her. Liquid crimson medicines were served in
plastic cups. The rooms had no mirrors.


But the reflections came clear to me then, come
still in quiet moments when past meets present so
smoothly the seams disappear and time itself turns
fluid. Sometimes I wish time stayed solid, in separable
chunks as distinct as the sound of the ticking
clock on my mantel. In truth, though, we break all
boundaries, hurtling forward through hope and
backward on the trail made by memory.


But what else can we do except reach, except
remember? What else can I do, having been assigned
this case? I will go in, go down. Go back.


American culture abounds with marketplace confessions.
I know this. And I know the criticisms levied

[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00199&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have to drive out of the city to get there, down forty
miles of roads I've avoided for the past eight years.
Where there was once farmland, horses spitting sand
as they galloped, wide willow trees I sat under when
the nurses let me out on passes, there are now squat,
square houses dotting the hills. But the building's
bubbled dome rises unmistakably over a crest as I
round the corner, floating there in the distance like a
glittering spaceship, looking exactly the same as it did
almost a decade ago. Walking back from passes, I
would see that domed bubble, that silver blister bursting
against a spring sky, and I would count, <i>One ...
two ... three</i> ... getting closer, my heart hammering
half with fear, half with relief. Safe again. Trapped
again. Safe again. Trapped aga—


And I have the same heart in the same socket of
chest, and it hammers the way it used to, and I find
myself thinking the same words, <i>Safe again, trapped
again</i>. My palms sweat on the steering wheel. I
remind myself: I am <i>not</i> that girl. I am <i>not</i> that girl.
I've changed. I've grown. It's a long time ago. I am
now a psychologist, who over the year has learned to
give up her Indian-print sundresses and bulky smocks
for tailored skirts, who carries a black Coach leather

[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And what I would tell them goes something like
this. On five separate occasions, spanning the ages
from fourteen to twenty-four, I spent considerable
portions of my life inside the very hospital whose
graveled drive I am now turning into. Until what
could be called my "recovery" at twenty-five or so, I
was admitted to this institution on the average of
every other year for up to several months. And even
today, at thirty-one years old, with all of that supposedly
behind me, with chunks of time in which to
construct and explain the problems that led me to
lockup, I find myself at a loss for words. Images
come, and perhaps in the images I can illuminate
some of my story. I am ten years old, sitting under
the piano, as my mother, her face a mask of pain,
pummels the keys. Beneath the bench I press the
golden pedals, hold them all down at the same time
so our house swells with raw and echoing sounds,
with crashing crescendos and wails that shiver up
inside my skin, lodging there a fear of a world I
know is impossible to negotiate, teetering on a cruel

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I am not that girl any longer. I tell that to myself as I
ride up the hospital's elevator. I found some sort of
way into recovery. But I know, have always known,
that I could go back. Mysterious neurons collide and
break. The brain bruises. Memories you thought were
buried rise up.

[p. <i>183</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00203&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I rise up in the elevator and the doors part with a
whisper. Stepping off, I find myself face-to-face with
yet another door, this one bolted and on it a sign that
says: ENTER WITH CAUTION. SPLIT RISK.


And now I am standing on the other side of that
door—the wrong, I mean the right, side of the door,
and I ring the buzzer. I look through the thick glass
window and see a nurse hustle down the hall, clipboard
in hand. I recognize her. Oh, my God, I recognize
her! I hunch, dart back. Impossible, I tell
myself. It's been over eight years. Staff turnover in
these places is unbelievably high. But it could be her,
couldn't it? And what happens if she recognizes
me? My mouth dries and something shrivels in my
throat.


"Dr. Slater?" she asks, opening the door. I nod,
peer into her eyes. They're the blue of sadness, thickly
fringed. Her lips are painted the palest sheen of pink.
"Welcome," she says, and she steps back to let me
pass. I was wrong—I've never seen this woman in my
life. I don't know those eyes, their liquid color, nor the
voice, in whose tone I hear, to my surprise, a ring of
deference. Doctor—she actually calls me doctor. She
bends a bit at the waist, in greeting, acknowledging
the hierarchies that exist in these places—nurses
below psychologists, psychologists below psychiatrists,
patients at the bottom of the ladder.

[p. <i>184</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00204&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

With a sudden surge of confidence, I step through.
The reversal is remarkable, and for a second it makes
me giddy. I'm aware of the incredible elasticity of
life, how the buckled can become straight, the broken
mended. Watch what is on the ground; watch
what you step on, for it could contain hidden powers
and, in a rage, fly up all emerald and scarlet to sting
your face.


And here I am, for the briefest moment, all emerald,
all scarlet. "Get me a glass of water," I imagine
barking to her. "Take your pills or I'll put you in the
quiet room."


Then the particular kind of dense quiet that sits
over the ward comes to me. Emerald goes. Scarlet
dies down. I am me again, here again. I grip my
briefcase and look down the shadowy hall, and it's
the same shadowy hall, loaded with the exact same
scents, as it was so many years ago. The paint is
that precise golden green. The odor is still undefinable,
sweet and wretched. Another woman comes
up, shakes my hand. "I'm Nancy," she says, "charge
nurse on the unit."


"Good to meet you," I say. And then I think I see
her squint at me. I've the urge to toss my hair in
front of my face, to mention a childhood in California
or Europe, how I've only been in this state for
a year.

[p. <i>185</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00205&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"We're meeting in the conference room," Nancy
says. Clutching my briefcase, I follow her down the
corridor. We pass open doors, and I hold my breath as
we come to the one numbered 6, because that was my
bedroom for many of the months I stayed here. I slow
down, try to peer in. Just as they used to, heavy curtains
hang over a large, thickly meshed window.
<i>There are the stars</i>, I want to say, for in my mind it's
night again, and someone is rocking in a corner. Now,
in the present time, a blond woman lies in what used
to be my bed. On that mattress swim my cells, the
ones we slough off, the pieces of ourselves we leave
behind, forever setting our signatures into the skin of
the world. As she sleeps, my name etches itself on her
smooth flesh, and my old pain pours into her head.


And just as we are passing her by, the woman leaps
out of bed and gallops to the door. "Oh, Nancy," she
keens. "I'm not safe, not safe. Get my doctor. I want
my doctor."


"Dr. Ness will be up to see you at four," Nancy says.


Suddenly the woman snarls, "Four. Dr. Ness is
always late. Always keeps me waiting. I want a new
doctor, someone who'll really care. A new doctor, a
new—"


Her voice rises and she sucks on her fist. "Stop it,
Kayla," Nancy says. "Take your fist out of your
mouth. You're twenty-nine years old. And if you

[p. <i>186</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00206&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Kayla stamps her foot, tosses her head like a regal
pony. "Screw you," she mutters now. "Screw this
whole fucking place," and then she stomps back into
her bed.


When we're a few feet beyond the scene, Nancy
turns to me, smiles conspiratorially. I feel my mouth
stretched into a similar smirk, and it relieves yet bothers
me, this expression toward a patient. "Borderline,"
Nancy says matter-of-factly, giving a crisp nod
of her head.


I sigh and nod back. "They're exhausting patients,
the ones with borderline personalities." I pause. "But
I prefer them to antisocials," I add, and as I say these
words I feel safe again, hidden behind my professional
mask. I am back on balance, tossing jargon
with the confidence of a Brahman in a village of
untouchables. There is betrayal here, in what I do,
but in betrayal I am finally camouflaged.


Of all the psychiatric illnesses, borderline personality
disorder may be the one professionals most dislike to
encounter. It's less serious than, say, schizophrenia,
for the borderline isn't usually psychotic, but such
patients are known for their flamboyant, attention-getting,
over-demanding ways of relating to others.

[p. <i>187</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00207&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I recall these words now, as we enter the conference
room, where several other nurses and doctors sit
around a table with a one-way mirror on the far wall.
I scan their faces quickly, praying I look as unfamiliar
to them as they do to me. I don't recognize any of the
people in here, and I'm hoping against hope they
don't recognize me. Still, even if we've never met, I

[p. <i>188</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00208&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Of course I won't say such a thing, wouldn't dare,
for I would lose my credibility. But the funny thing is,
I'm supposedly in a profession that values honesty and
self-revelation. Freud himself claimed you couldn't do
good analytic work until you'd "come clean" with
yourself in the presence of another, until you'd spoken
in the bright daylight your repressed secrets and memories.
Freud told us not to be so ashamed, to set loose
and let waltz our mothers and fathers, our wetness
and skins. Training programs for psychologists like
me, and the clinics we later work in, have as a credo
the admission and discussion of countertransference,
which by necessity claims elements of private conflict.


But at the same time, another, more subtle yet powerful
message gets transmitted to practitioners in the
field. This message says, <i>Admit your pain, but only to
a point. Admit it but keep it clean. Go into therapy,
but don't call yourself one of us if you're</i> anything
<i>more than nicely neurotic</i>. The field transmits this

[p. <i>189</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00209&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I recognize the conference room as the place where,
when I was fourteen, I met with my mother and the
social worker for the last time. My father had gone
away to Egypt. My mother, abandoned by him, somehow
always abandoned and lonely, even as she surrounded
herself with people, was wearing a scarf
around her neck and a gold Star of David wedged

[p. <i>190</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00210&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This is the conference room where she, unstable,
rageful, maybe delusional at times, shot through with
a perpetual anxiety that made her hands shake, told
me she was giving me up, giving me over to become a
foster child. "I can't handle you anymore," she'd said
to me, spit at me. "I no longer want you in my house."


I bow my head in deference to something I cannot
name, and enter the room. Things are screaming
inside me and my eyes feel hot. Nancy introduces me
all around, and I take a seat, pull out a notebook, try
to act as calm and composed as possible. "The patient
Ms. Cogswell," the bearded psychiatrist begins, "is
not able to make good use of the hospital. She's an
extreme borderline, wreaking havoc on the unit. We
suspect her of some factitious posturing as well." He
pauses, looks at me, clears his throat. I smile back at
him but my mouth feels uncoordinated, tightness at
its corners. I won't cry, won't cry, even though in the
one-way mirror, in the criss-crossing of the creamy
branches beyond the ward's windows, I see my
mother again, her face coming to me clearly, her eyes

[p. <i>191</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00211&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"We think," a social worker named Miss Norton
continues, "that we'll be discharging her in a matter of
days, as soon as we get her stabilized on some meds.
We take it you'll be picking up her case on an outpatient
basis. Any ideas of how you'll work with her?"


I nod, pretend to make some notes on the pad. As
my voice rises through my throat, I'm surprised at
how smooth it sounds, a sleek bolt of silk. "Lots of
limits," I say. "We know borderlines do well with lots
of limits. This is the only context in which a workable
transference can begin."


The bearded doctor nods. In the tree, my mother
tongues her teeth and wind lifts her lovely skirt,
embroidered with fragile flowers. And then she is not
my mother anymore, but a little girl whose legs are
white, a single ruby scar on scrubbed knee. And while
part of me sits in the conference room, part of me flies
out to meet this girl, to touch the sore spot, fondling
it with my fingers.


For I have learned how to soothe the hot spots,
how to salve the soreness on my skin. I can do it so no
one notices, can do it while I teach a class if I need to,
or lead a seminar on psychodiagnosis. I can do it
while I talk to you in the evenest of tones. "Shhhh," I
whisper to the hurting part, hidden here. You can call

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00212&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Still, I wonder. Why—how—have I managed to
learn these things while others have not? Why have I
managed somehow to leave behind at least for now
what looks like wreckage, and shape something solid
from my life? My prognosis, after all, was very poor.
In idle moments, I still slide my fingers under the
sleeves of my shirt and trace the raised white nubs of
scars that track my arms from years and years of cutting.

[p. <i>193</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00213&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And other things too. E. J. Anthony wrote in his
landmark study, <i>The Invulnerable Child</i>, that some
children manage to avoid or grow out of traumatic
pasts when there is the presence in their lives of at
least one stable adult—an aunt, a neighbor, a teacher.
I had the extreme good fortune to be placed in a foster
home where I stayed for four years, until I turned
eighteen, where I was lovingly cared about and
believed in. Even when my behavior was so bad I cut
myself in their kitchen with the steak knife, or when,
out of rage, I swallowed all the Excedrin in their
medicine cabinet and had to go back to the unit, my
foster parents continued to believe in my abilities to

[p. <i>194</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00214&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At a break in the conference, a nurse offers me a cup
of coffee. "Sure," I say, "but first the ladies' room."
And then I'm off, striding down the hallway I know
so well, its twists and turns etched in subterranean
memory. I go left, then right, swing open the old
wooden ladies' room door, and sit in a stall.


When I come back, the nurse is ready with a steaming
plastic cup. She looks at me, puzzled, as she hands
me my hot coffee. "You've been here before?" she asks.

[p. <i>195</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00215&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My face must show some surprise, for she adds, "I
mean, the bathrooms. You know where they are."


"Oh," I say quickly. "Right. I've visited some of my
patients on this ward before, yes."


"You don't have to use the patient bathroom," she
says, smiling oddly, looking at me with what I think
may be suspicion. "We don't recommend it," she
adds. "Please use the staff bathroom, through the
nurse's station."


"OK," I say. I bend my face into the coffee's steam,
hoping she'll think the redness is from the rising heat.
Of course. How stupid of me. What's she thinking?
Can she guess? But in a way I <i>am</i> one of the patients,
and she could be too. I'm not ready to say it yet,
though. Weak one. Wise one. This time, memory has
led me astray.


The conference resumes. I pay little attention. I'm
thinking about the faux pas with the bathroom, and
then I'm watching the wind in the tree outside the
window. I am thinking about how we all share a similar,
if not single pain, and the rifts between stalls and
selves is its own form of delusion. And then I hear,
through a thin ceiling, wails twining down, a sharp
scream, the clattering of footsteps. I sit up straight.


"Delivery room," the social worker says, pointing
up. "We're one floor under the maternity ward."

I smile. That's right. North Two is just one floor of
what is an old large public hospital. The psychiatric
unit we're on has always been wedged between labor
rooms upstairs and a nursery downstairs. When I was
a patient, I could often hear, during group therapy or
as I drifted into a drugged sleep, the cries of pushing
women as their muscles contracted and in great pain
their pink skins ripped, a head coming to crown.


"Why don't you meet with Linda now," the psychiatrist
says, checking his watch and gathering his
papers. Everyone stands, signaling the end of the conference.


"You can take one of the interview rooms," Nancy,
the charge nurse, adds. "They're nice places for doing
therapy, comfortable."


I nod. I've almost forgotten about Linda and how
she is the reason for my return here today. Now I
walk with the rest out of the conference room and
Nancy points down the long hall. "There," she says,
her finger aiming toward a door on the left. "The
third room. We'll bring Linda to you." And then, to
my surprise, Nancy fishes deep into her pocket and
pulls out a large steel ring of keys, placing them in my
hand. They're the same keys, I know, from all those
years ago, keys I was not allowed to touch but that I
watched avidly whenever I could, the cold green
gleam and mysterious squared prongs opening doors

Slowly, I make my way down the hall to the interview
room, stand outside the locked door holding the
key ring. It feels cool, and I press it to my cheek. A
hand there once, feeling me for a fever, stroking away
my fear. Bless those who have helped.


A woman who looks far older than her thirty-seven
years is now making her way down the hall. Stooped,
she is, with tired red ringlets of hair. As she gets closer
I see the dark ditches under her eyes, where years of
fatigue and fear have gathered. I would like to put my
finger there, sweep away the microscopic detritus of
suffering.


"Linda," I say, and as she comes close to me, I
extend my hand. "Hello," I say, and I can hear a gentleness
in my voice, a warm wind in me, for I am
greeting not only her, but myself.


We stand in front of the locked interview room and
I fumble for the correct key. I start to insert it in the
lock, but then, halfway done, I stop. "You," I say to

[p. <i>198</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353308-I00218&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She arches one eyebrow, stares up at me. Her face
seems to say, <i>Who are you, anyway?</i> I want to cry.
The hours here have been too long and hard. "You,"
I say again, and then I feel my eyes actually begin to
tear. She steps forward, peers closely, her expression
confused. Surely she's never seen one of her doctors
cry. "It's OK," I say. "I know what I'm doing." And
for a reason I cannot quite articulate at the moment, I
make no effort to hide the wetness. I look straight at
her. At the same time, for the first time today, my
voice feels genuinely confident. "Take the keys,
Linda," I say, "and open the door."


She reaches out a bony hand, takes the keys from
me, and swings open the door. The interview room is
shining with sun, one wall all windows. I've been in
this room too, probably hundreds of times over the
years, meeting with the psychiatrists who tried to
treat me. I shiver with the memory. Ultimately it was
not their treatments or their theories that helped me
get better, but the kindness lodged in a difficult world.
And from the floor above comes the cry of a protesting
baby, a woman ripped raw in birth. She is us. "We
are her. As my mother used to say, rocking over the
Shabbat candles, chanting Jewish prayers late, late

She would pause then, her hands held cupped over
the candlesticks. "We are one," she would repeat to me
after a few moments, her strained face peering at me
through shadows. "As a people we are always one."


Sometimes I miss her.


My patient and I sit down, look at each other. I see
myself in her. I trust she sees herself in me.


This is where we begin.
