BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, what brings you in today?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I needed a new psychiatrist and I didn't uh, I always thought you were a child psychiatrist that's why I never contacted you and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] suggested, because the one I've been to in [DEIDENTIFIED] the last 11 years, he had the utmost patience, but the last couple of months he's been very abrupt with me almost hanging up.  Why, I have no idea, I was in tears.  Anyway, I started to go a doctor in [DEIDENTIFIED] for the last two months but I have to pay upfront.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I paid almost $800 and haven't gotten reimbursed yet, I'm out of money.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I'm sorry.
<b>PT:</b> So I talked to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] why didn't you ever call me first I would have told you [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] wasn't just a child psychiatrist.  I didn't know that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I see both, both adults and children.
<b>PT:</b> Actually I've seen you 30 years ago.
<b>DR:</b> Really.
<b>PT:</b> For a year, yes.
<b>DR:</b> Were you a child then?
<b>PT:</b> I was about [AGE], in early [AGE]'s, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I probably don't have your chart anymore.
<b>PT:</b> Oh I'm sure.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah we only keep them about seven years, so.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So um, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] seeing you weekly or -
<b>PT:</b> Um, maybe every couple of weeks -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Two to three weeks.
<b>DR:</b> And this psychiatrist that saw you in [DEIDENTIFIED] were you stable on the medication they had you on?
<b>PT:</b> He had me on Zyprexa for 11 years but I did well with it but he's concerned about its safety, took me off and put me on Abilify.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I'm having a lot of restlessness, problems sleeping so the doctor in [DEIDENTIFIED] reduced the dosage, I'm a little better but still I can't function too well.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I guess it's from Zyprexa has sedation and my mom had diabetes and I'm scared to -
<b>DR:</b> It does, you do have a vulnerability for bringing on diabetes if you gain weight and with Zyprexa -
<b>PT:</b> I've lost weight.
<b>DR:</b> You can gain weight with Zyprexa.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know that's his other reason but some, my family doctor told me you could get diabetes from Zyprexa even without weight gain, is that true?
<b>DR:</b> Um, in f, there's a fam, there's a, in families with bipolar disorders, <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span>, there's a high rate of development of diabetes, there's a diabetes tendency.
<b>PT:</b> No matter even if you're skinny.
<b>DR:</b> Even if you're thin and you may bring it out but with the atypical antipsychotics like Zyprexa -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Abilify, it may bring it out sooner.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> So the Lilly people who make Zyprexa say "If you watch your diet and you're very careful, that vulnerability is not as bad of a problem."
<b>PT:</b> Okay, three months ago my blood work, my blood sugar was 98 -
<b>DR:</b> Fasting blood sugar.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, overnight.
<b>DR:</b> And that's very normal and he was, and it wasn't climbing at all, right.
<b>PT:</b> No, it was 107 and then I lost weight, it came down to 98 three months ago, I have to go for another blood test in a month.
<b>DR:</b> So they, they want to be on the safe side by switching you over probably.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well that's the only thing I could really function on, the only thing was I stopped, my family physician suggested for him to try me on Seroquel because I started being obsessed about a lot of things.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> My OCD kicked in really bad, checking things and all that, Seroquel, two weeks of it almost put my in the psyche ward and that's what started all this bad stuff that he changed me to Abilify.  Now Abilify is starting to help my obsessions but my sleeping patterns are not as well, I'm restless, jittery, I haven't driven a car outside of [DEIDENTIFIED] for five, six weeks because I get panicky and afraid I'm going to pass out.  I don't feel well half, some days, most of the days.
<b>DR:</b> You don't feel too comfortable, you're just a little uh, nervous.
<b>PT:</b> Nervous, jittery, I can't, I can't get out and also when he first started me on Abilify he started me on 15 mg in the morning but he kept me on my 10 mg of Zyprexa at night for 10 days.  The depression lifted and I was less irritable.  After 10 days, he stopped the 10 mg of Zyprexa and put me on 30 mg of Abilify alone.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> That sent me for a loop so when I changed doctors he put me down to what I'm on now 20 mg of Abilify, I'm a tiny bit better but still not enough.
<b>DR:</b> And how about the Zyprexa, you off that or?
<b>PT:</b> I'm off that.
<b>DR:</b> All right, there is a risk with, by the way, with Abilify also, with diabetes -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Not as much as with Zyprexa.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Um and some people will suggest that you combine both.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And if the Zyprexa helps you -
<b>PT:</b> A low dose?
<b>DR:</b> Take 2 mg is a low dose.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And I think that we may do and just take you at this time -
<b>PT:</b> Oh good, so take the, I take the Abilify 20 mg at 4:00 pm with my 60 mg of Celexa.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I take 0.5 mg of Klonopin at 8:00 am and 0.5 mg uh, at bedtime, but if I'm going to go on Zyprexa at bedtime, I can take my second Klonopin at 4:00 pm.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you can do that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay and Zyprexa will be at bed?
<b>DR:</b> I would use it at bed because it is -
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yes.
<b>DR:</b> And you said you feel you do better with a little Zyprexa.
<b>PT:</b> Yes definitely.
<b>DR:</b> Any um, allergies to anything?
<b>PT:</b> Penicillin, Stelazine, I don't know if Stelazine was a reaction or not -
<b>DR:</b> You got that stiffness and you -
<b>PT:</b> No, no I got a rash but I ate a lot of strawberries that week so it could have been that.
<b>DR:</b> Are you allergic to strawberries?
<b>PT:</b> No but who knows, it was summertime.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, Pyridium, Bactrim, sulfa drugs -
<b>DR:</b> These are all things you're allergic to?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah uh, supposedly Librium but I don't know, I broke out on my chest, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> You be careful of yourself but I, I basically, medically you're no hypertension, no diabetes, you -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have high blood pressure.
<b>DR:</b> What do you take for that?
<b>PT:</b> Avapro and I take Lipitor for my cholesterol but actually, my cholesterol, the last blood test three months ago, was 114.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> He's concerned about my triglycerides, it was 239 but I could get that, I've lost 10 more pou, 15 more pounds since I had the blood test so -
<b>DR:</b> They will go up and triglycerides go up with carbohydrates sometimes.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's hard to get them down um, do you take like any fish oil or?
<b>PT:</b> No, no.
<b>DR:</b> Um, there's another one, flax seed oil will increase your HDL cholesterol that's the good -
<b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah, the good cholesterol, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you want to make sure that stays up.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So basically you're in good health, the, the ups and downs swings are under control.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I have acid reflux and regur, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And what do you do for that?
<b>PT:</b> Prevacid.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And then, I have sleep apnea, I sleep with the mask but I haven't done that in two weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Because you're -
<b>PT:</b> Because I'm nervous, it's a pain in the neck, it's a real pain the keister to wear that mask, fill it up a lot with the water, do this, do that -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It's a -
<b>DR:</b> Are you using the humidifier on your -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah I have full facemask because I sleep with my mouth open.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> The no, na, just the nasal one made me so that I felt like I was suffocating and if I open my mouth it's not doing any good anyway.
<b>DR:</b> No but you're take, you're doing all the right things to keep yourself healthy which is -
<b>PT:</b> Right, right I have my bed elevated for my GERDs six inches so.  Now also since the 15 mg of Abilify helped me, it released the depression, since I'm on 20, of course it's only been a week -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not as interested, I used to love TV, I used to love my computer, my music, I don't go out with my girlfriends, I don't understand.
<b>DR:</b> So when it was higher you didn't do as well.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> He had it to 20.
<b>PT:</b> It's a teeny bit better but it's only been a week.
<b>DR:</b> All right, maybe you'll reconsider and we'll cut it 15 or something.
<b>PT:</b> What do you think?
<b>DR:</b> Well you want to be socially, like to do, you want to still have your interests, right.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, you see, I have an appointment the [DATE] of this month, do you think we should try the Zyprexa first and then on the [DATE] see if we want to go down to 15?
<b>DR:</b> Right, that's a good idea.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] to 15, or that to 2 mg of the Zyprexa.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Oh and I take Lipitor, I told you that.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Don't mind me, I 'm a nervous wreck, I get panicky, panicky.
<b>DR:</b> You take good care of yourself though.  You do, [LAUGHING] you take your medicine which is you know.
<b>PT:</b> Um, like this is my [NAME OTHER], if it weren't for him I don't know what I'd do, he helps me tremendously.
<b>DR:</b> He drives back.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I've been with him 11 years.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> We don't get married because I don't want to lose my disability but -
<b>DR:</b> That's so common, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's a problem it's a shame.
<b>DR:</b> And everything, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He says we don't need a paper to show our love.  So the only thing you're changing is -
<b>DR:</b> I'll add a little Zyprexa.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think, I have to look it up, it's either 2 or 2.5 mg.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I think it's 2.5, if I remember, I'm on a computer all the time I got to stay away from medical sites.  Um, I take my Abilify at 4:00 pm I could take the Zyprexa at 8:00 pm
<b>DR:</b> Yeah but when go to bed -
<b>PT:</b> Okay, so that's good.
<b>DR:</b> Abilify you said you're taking 20, right.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I take Klonopin in the 8:00 am, 0.5 mg of Klonopin at 8:00 am, at 4:00 pm I take 60 mg of Zyprexa, I mean Celexa -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And 20 mg of Abilify and at 8:30 I take my other half of Klonopin -
<b>DR:</b> Now the Celexa you're getting the 20 mg.
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm getting the 40 mg pill and then I cut, I get 45 all together so I cut it, 1.5 pills equals 60 mg.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And my Klonopin, uh, can you give me, are you going to give me uh, scripts for all of them?
<b>DR:</b> Yes, I will today.
<b>PT:</b> The Klonopin I was getting 1 mg and cutting it in half but can you give me  0.5 mg pill so I don't have to cut it in half, I take twice a day.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Um, I just, what your birthday is what?
<b>PT:</b> [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll be [AGE] next week is it?
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] Zyprexa.
<b>PT:</b> I'm taking the Zyprexa at, at 8:30 and my Abilify, everything stays the same except adding the Zyprexa.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> So, um you don't have any suicidal thoughts -
<b>PT:</b> No, no.  Let me tell you, I've said I'd rather be dead but let me tell you I'd have to hire somebody to kill me, then I'd probably change my mind and be looking over my shoulder paranoid for the rest of my life they'd catch up with me.
<b>CG:</b> Especially [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, right, right.  [LAUGHING]
<b>CG:</b> If you did pay them you might be able to negotiate -
<b>PT:</b> Oh geez whiz, I'm laughing now because it's not too bad of a day but on my bad days when I'm home alone, see I stay home alone too much, I think too much.  He's working, you know.  So it's not a problem Abilify at 4:00 and Zyprexa at 8:30, that close?
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> We'll, we'll see how it works because the combination, I think you'll still get the protection by lowering Zyprexa but there's some people that need just a small amount -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're not having any depressive thoughts, no suicidal thoughts.
<b>PT:</b> I'm depressed but I'm not suicidal no.
<b>DR:</b> And, and you're, you able to sleep through the night or are you waking up a lot?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm waking up a lot, I keep looking at the clock.  I go to bed at 10:00, I wake up, since Abilify like 4:30 -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But once in a while I'll fall asleep during the, uh, after dinner for an hour or so before bedtime, so I'm still getting at least six hours sleep all together but it's not the same sedated sleep as when I was on Zyprexa, I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Well I want you to sleep but don't be too sedated, you want to get
<b>PT:</b> Right, right well 2.5 compared to the 10 mg of Zyprexa I used to be on is a lot different.
<b>DR:</b> Um, I would like to sign, I don't know if you signed a release to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], but I see, get some information from the doctors who saw you.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> Um, if you don't mind uh, if you have their names just let [NAME OTHER] know outside.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And we'll, yeah, I just need a summary, I don't need all the records.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So today is the [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Oh the doctor in [DEIDENTIFIED] is going to be mad.  He doesn't give refills on the scripts he said because people tend not to come back but I spent almost  $600-$800 already, I need to be reimbursed.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, he was -
<b>PT:</b> I mean he's a nice doctor, don't get me wrong but -
<b>DR:</b> Is that, is that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I never met him but I know -
<b>PT:</b> He's a nice man.  My doctor in [DEIDENTIFIED] was extremely nice and patient, I don't know what happened, I really don't know and I'm all upset over it but -
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't sound like it ended well.
<b>PT:</b> No, it didn't, he doesn't even know I'm not coming back in October, I only see him twice a year but I guess maybe I asked too many questions maybe that was it.
<b>DR:</b> You should be able to ask questions.
<b>PT:</b> Right, well on the phone -
<b>DR:</b> Your paying the bill.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> He doesn't like to ask the questions, right?
<b>PT:</b> On the phone last month he says, "I don't have time for this" and almost hung up on me.  It, yeah, matter of fact he did.  Couple of times, in, one, I don't know.  I, I'm just surprised, so surprised.
<b>DR:</b> I have to have you sign these permission to medicate slips so.
<b>PT:</b> Um, Medicaid?
<b>DR:</b> No, it's for medication.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> For, for the Abilify, the Zyprexa, the Klonopin.
<b>PT:</b> And the Celexa.
<b>DR:</b> Celexa, if you get any rash from them, stop them
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Just stop them cold turkey.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you can stop cold turkey and just call me, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea -
<b>PT:</b> I get that automatically anyway.
<b>DR:</b> Always eat first, just eat something -
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> Always take your pills with food.
<b>PT:</b> You know the first week I was on 15 mg of Abilify and 10 mg of Zyprexa at the same time my blood pressure went up some.
<b>DR:</b> That's strange because usually they'll come down with those.
<b>PT:</b> You think it's because, you know, I got that first week on both them together I got flu like symptoms and I was sick, congested, sneezing, I don't know if that was due to the medicine or just uh, a bug I had.  Maybe that brought up my blood pressure.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you said they were cutting the, the Zyprexa down.
<b>PT:</b> No, he kept me on the 10 mg at night of Zyprexa the first 10 days plus 15 mg of Abilify in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> Normally they will bring down blood pressure -
<b>PT:</b> Oh okay.
<b>DR:</b> You think you might have been just worried about the change?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I don't do well with change at all.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, what I'm going to have you do is um, if you sign here -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> I can talk with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], all right.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, on the right yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And these are just permission to medicate slips.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So I'm going to put you on the Celexa, the Abilify, you're already on all of them.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, except the Zyprexa.
<b>DR:</b> And this just states that if you get a rash stop and there's two forms there, it all depends on what insurance you're using, one is good for one, one's good for the other.
<b>PT:</b> I have Medicare and AARP supplement.
<b>DR:</b> They may require all of those so.  All right.  So you'll be seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> And I have an appointment with you still the [DATE] should I keep it?  At a quarter of -
<b>DR:</b> Actually you probably should keep that as med check.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Just have them change it to a med check, all right?
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> And um, then we'll see how everything -
<b>PT:</b> Then I have another appointment with you uh, [DATE] should I keep that one also?
<b>DR:</b> Um, probably we'll stretch that out because -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I'll be seeing you when?
<b>PT:</b> You're going to see me the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah we may be able to stretch that one, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, so I'll tell them to stretch it to -
<b>DR:</b> Like at a month from the one in May.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, all right.
<b>DR:</b> They set those just to make sure you had a space probably.
<b>PT:</b> Right, right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] still up here.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So my name's not in this research project?
<b>DR:</b> Well no, not, your name will be left out eventually.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> When they, they just, from what I understand they will contact you if you permit that and so if you don't, that's all right too.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> But if they have any questions they'll contact you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, supposedly they'll reimburse you something if you do ask you questions.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And um, when they put all the data together eventually there will be no names, all right?
<b>PT:</b> Okay, so um, um, what did I want to ask, uh, so my Klonopin, I've been taking it at night, I can take anywhere's from 4:00 pm to nighttime but actually I'm not going to need it at -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Nighttime now.  Now if I start feeling a lot better can I just stop my second Klonopin?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, absolutely.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, as long as I take one a day that's what the doctor in [DEIDENTIFIED] always told me because I've been on it 11 years.
<b>DR:</b> May be he felt that -
<b>PT:</b> With no reaction.
<b>DR:</b> Well the other thing you can get is uh, is when you withdraw from a, a minor tranquilizer, if you suddenly stopped it you could have a seizure.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.
<b>DR:</b> So, that's why he, he is doing it so -
<b>PT:</b> So I have to take it once a day but he said a seizure wouldn't be unless I suddenly stopped it not until a week or so later.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean it's not going to happen if I accidentally forgot it for three days would it?
<b>DR:</b> Three days with no Klonopin?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I, you never know.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay, all right.
<b>DR:</b> You want to try to be consistent with these meds.
<b>PT:</b> Right, right, so it's all right to go back and forth from 0.5 Klonopin, 0.5 mg of Klonopin to a whole mg every other day or whatever?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, if you wanted that, yeah if you feel too sedated from uh, everyday feel free to do that.
<b>PT:</b> It's fine to go back and forth one pill or two pills.
<b>DR:</b> As long as you're all right.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> As long as you don't notice any major problems with it.
<b>PT:</b> Right, right.  Don't mind me, I ask and ask and ask and if I didn't bring him -
<b>CG:</b> We were doing that.
<b>PT:</b> Well -
<b>CG:</b> We were, we were, if you didn't need the second Klonopin, you weren't taking it.
<b>PT:</b> Right, right.
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, I need to interrupt this, uh, on the Zyprexa you probably should take it at night because it makes you sleepy -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, that's how I always did it for 11 years.  You must love plants.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, I do love plants uh, I started out in an office environment with no windows -
<b>PT:</b> Oh really -
<b>DR:</b> Two little plants.
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> That tree is 34 years old -
<b>PT:</b> Oh my goodness.
<b>DR:</b> It was a Father's Day gift from my oldest daughter.
<b>PT:</b> How about that, that's great.
<b>DR:</b> I used to say I was retiring when it hit that window but -
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING]
<b>DR:</b> By the time it gets there I'll be in my 100s.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> It's slow growing.
<b>PT:</b> I don't have a green thumb at all, I kill every plant I've ever gotten and I've even killed a cactus plant and they're hard to kill.
<b>DR:</b> You over water probably.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> That's mostly what does it.
<b>PT:</b> So a girlfriend last month bought me a plant, a fern -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> It needs no light and no water, I don't know -
<b>DR:</b> It's an air fern maybe -
<b>PT:</b> Is that what it is?  It's a pretty plant, I said that's the only kind I can keep.
<b>DR:</b> You have cats in the house?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Good because they love [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Oh geez, that could be dangerous couldn't it?  For them?
<b>DR:</b> Well I'm not sure if they're poisonous but I know cats like to bat them around and -
<b>PT:</b> Hm.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, on your Klonopin -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Is that name brand or generic?
<b>PT:</b> Oh it's generic on Celexa and Klonopin, I think it has to do with my insurance.  Because I have AARP Rx saver and I think if they could give generic they do.
<b>DR:</b> All right I will see you then um -
<b>PT:</b> The [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> The [DATE], if you run into any problems give me a call.
<b>PT:</b> All right, thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Hopefully everything will be okay.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I hope so doctor, I'm really, my friends are yelling at me, matter of fact two girlfriends called me today, "Can you go out to lunch with us, we'll pick you up."  No I don't want to, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Have you had like any periods where you ever got really intensely high and were spending money doing stuff like that or?
<b>PT:</b> I have a gambling problem.
<b>DR:</b> That can be a major problem.
<b>PT:</b> He's bailed me out plenty of times.  Yes, that's the only thing.
<b>DR:</b> You like the casinos what do you play the slots -
<b>PT:</b> Well I fly to the casinos where he had to bail me out, I like the scratch off tickets, I'm constantly running and buying them.
<b>CG:</b> Scratch them.
<b>DR:</b> You ever get anything on them?
<b>PT:</b> I've won 5,000 on the scra, the $2 scratch off, 1,000, 500 several times, 100s, you know.
<b>DR:</b> And what have you spent to get that money?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah the [INAUDIBLE], that I haven't calculated, that, that I don't know.
<b>CG:</b> That we wouldn't told you if they win.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING]
<b>CG:</b> I spent 20,000 for that 5,000.
<b>PT:</b> Right, right, right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It's just a thrill, the thrill of it.  Hm, it's good you know.  You don't -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> So good.  All right, thank you very much.
<b>DR:</b> You take care, pleasure meeting you.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>CG:</b> Nice meeting you.
<b>PT:</b> Nice seeing you again, all right.
<b>DR:</b> When you go out just make sure you get the, have them, sign the release to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and uh -
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> You know him?
<b>DR:</b> I knew a [NAME OTHER] but she -
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> How old is he?  Young guy?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I'd say he's, I'd, I'd say he's, 59, 60.
<b>DR:</b> All right, he and I don't think they're married anymore, I knew a child psychiatrist [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and she kept her husbands name when she married.
