<b>W</b>e were there.


"God."I got out of the car. "The river. It's like you said.
It's beautiful."


Below us the still-rising sun hit the surface of the Guadalupe and shot
the brackish brown with streaks of gold and silver and early-morning
pink. Canyonlike walls studded with stubby little trees channeled the
river, which snaked into a patch of little eddies as the water sloshed over
rocks. A gigantic metal-and-wood slide poured down into it.


"That <i>view</i>."


Stan stood behind me.


"Told ya. This is where <i>I'd</i> come if I was running away." He
pointed to the slide. "We'd go down that every morning just to
wake up, hit the cold water. Some days I wouldn't even shower."

[p. <i>208</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00215&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Just like I hadn't, that...when was it now? Yesterday morning?
Yesterday morning I'd woken up in New York, wondering how and
where I'd begin the search for my brother. An hour or two after that,
I was on a plane to Dallas. An hour or two after that, I was wandering
the grounds of my old college. A few hours after that, I was
hooking up with a kid who'd magically take both of us on an all-night
"Road Trip!" we'd be too cowardly to take by ourselves. All of
that, in a little over twenty-four hours. Twenty-four hours, or seven
years; take your pick how much time had actually passed, as it all
swam together in my head.


Anchored by a stone fence of sorts, a sturdy iron gate formed the
entrance to Mo Ranch—named after a Mr. Moran, I'd actually
learned from Stan during the course of the drive—but the gates
were swung open.


"Look, it's open. Maybe that means he's here. He drove in and
didn't close it."


"Not necessarily. They keep it open nearly all the time."


Did he want Tim to be here or not?


Did <i>I</i> want him to be here?


"The camp mostly closes down after the summer. A few groups
on the weekend, I think, stuff like that, but—Let's drive down to the
barn. It's just a few minutes more."


"Are we gonna get in trouble?"


All night on the road, and suddenly I'm afraid of trouble.


Stan had a dubious answer. "If anybody asks, I'll tell 'em I left my
watch here last summer, and I'm looking for it."


"<i>I'll</i> tell 'em Tim left his heart here; we're looking for that, too.
Plus the person that belongs to the heart."


His heart, split in two. He couldn't save Sarah, so he moved on to
Carrie. When he knew he couldn't love her, he moved on to Gil.

[p. <i>209</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00216&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was suddenly afraid to be here.


This was real.


This was Tim's, not mine.


I was the intruder.


Stan read my mind. "You okay? You okay with this? I can go first."


First, my big black angel on the 911 call....


...then Sean and Dave, my hunky policemen....


...and now skinny little Stanley Kowalski.


My angels came in every shape and color and size.


I wasn't okay with this; I wasn't ready, but none of them had to
know that:


"Yeah, I'm ready."


("But are ye able?" asked the Master.


I couldn't answer.)


"Where should we start?"


"The barn. It's not far."


He drove the rest of the way in and stopped when I saw something
I had only read about before.


"Oh my God, there it is...there's the heart...the one Tim wrote
about."


A giant heart, carved from rock, was set above the entrance to the
long narrow barn, with the tall pitched roof. Tim had discovered it
on one of his last days there, when rains, which would soon turn
into floods, washed away the dust that had hidden it all summer. A
perfect metaphor for his time there: only when he was leaving,
almost too late, did he discover his heart. I half expected that if I
could climb up to take a closer look, the name "Tim" would be carved
into half of it, bisected by an arrow, and the name—whose? Carrie's
or Gil's?—would be carved into the other half.

[p. <i>210</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00217&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I only found out the truth after the summer, after the breakdown,
when I found a love letter Tim had written to Gil, stuffed in that
same bedside cubbyhole at home that held Tim's asthma inhaler and
Valium, the Valium I stole. A love letter written one hot and sticky
night at Mo Ranch, when the air was filled with the conversations
of cicadas.


<i>My Precious Gil</i>—


<i>It was a Friday night on the verge of Saturday when Mo Ranch
decided to play its one disco tape, Village People, and transform its concrete
stage into Disco Barn. The centipedes hid under the painted revival chairs,
and the mirror ball shook. All was complete, but wait! Was that not Young
Tim in the corner, with a bit of melancholy in his heart? "Where is Paul?
Where is Sondra?" he asked plaintively, dancing from couple to couple,
remembering the two Tim and Gil had met on one of their fust dates in
Dallas. Through the din of Donna Summer and Smoke (get it?), Tim
remembered Sondra's sordid confession: "Yes, Tim and Gil, a year ago, I
was a boring person. Yes, I know you find that hard to believe. " And Tim
did find it hard to believe. The boys, glowing from a few times on the dance
floor and from the general enchantment of the evening, refused Sondra and
Paul's offer of artificial stimulants, opting instead for delights of their own
imagination. And Tim, still remembering the cool of the air conditioner
against his face and the delight of Gil near him, continued his search,
trying to separate the dancer from the dance</i>.


<i>On several occasions so far, I have played the "underground game" first
thing in the morning. It involves mental geometry of a complicated sort. I
awaken at Mo Ranch every morning without fail, but with a little jiggling</i>

[p. <i>211</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00218&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>And you are always there, oh Precious, always there</i>.


Precious is what he used to call me.


The letters were coming back, and I wasn't holding a thing in my
hands.


Just in my head.


Glass shattered.


"Oops."


Gentle, delicate Stan had just committed an act of vandalism for
me, trying to open a stuck window at the barn/theater.


"I thought I could just wedge it open. I couldn't."


"Are you okay?"


"Yeah."


He gingerly cleared out the rest of the glass, looking around to
make sure no one had seen him.


"Gimme a boost."


I cupped my hands for him to step into, and he lifted himself
through the window.


"Don't cut yourself."


Don't cut yourself. If only someone had said those three little
words to Tim.


Stan pulled himself up on his belly and plopped down on the
other side.


"Wait there. I'll go around to the front and open it."

[p. <i>212</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00219&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I waited and saw Tim's hand smashing through a plate-glass window,
a Superman "POW!" with an uppercut, and then—no Superman
powers had he. He bled just like anyone else.


A big weathered wooden door began sliding open on a track, Stan
pushing it from the inside. The light from outside filtered in, its shadow
lengthening as the door opened wider and wider.


"If it's all locked up, Tim couldn't have gotten in," I said.


"Not really. I saw another smashed window on the other side. He
could've done that."


My heart pounded faster, thinking Tim might actually be here.


"You okay?"


This time it was Stan asking it.


"Would everybody quit asking that? I'm <i>fine</i>. He's my <i>brother</i>. It's
my <i>job</i>."


I am my brother's keeper.


I am my brother's keeperkeeperkeeper....


If I said it enough, maybe I'd start believing it.


He wasn't here. He couldn't be.


He'd've heard us.


He'd've come out already.


Game's over.


I started shaking again and grabbed on to the side of the barn, the
bleached flagstone cool in the early morning.


"You okay?" Stan asked, one last time.


"Just <i>go</i>."


I followed him inside the barn, directly into the V-shaped wedge
of light cast onto the stage from the open sliding door. "The Barn"
was a misnomer; it was a name that had stuck from a prior life. It was
now a full-fledged little theater in the three-quarters round, Dub's
preferred style of staging. Audience platforms, with creaky old

[p. <i>213</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00220&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All of a sudden, Stan ran to a circular staircase, the top of which
disappeared into a balcony.


"STELLA!"


Such a big sound, coming from such a little boy.


"Dub says I've gotta work on owning the stage, so... ‘STELLA!’"


He shook the staircase.


"I don't know. It's more like I'm renting it. God, I had so much
fun here last summer."


Maybe that's why he was here, pure and simple: a return to a place
where he'd had so much fun. How many places like that did we
actually ever have in our lives? I couldn't blame him for wanting to
relive the good times.


"Here. You try."


He guided my hands onto the staircase and shook it, his hands on
top of mine.


"Scream ‘STELLA!!!’ It'll be good for you. Get it out of your system."


"Get what out?"


"Whatever."


I couldn't.


"C'mon. Nobody's here. Let loose."


I tried, but a weak-willed "Tim!" came out instead.


He didn't know what to say. "Let me check the rooms."


He headed up the circular staircase, leading up to dorm-style
rooms on the second level.


I wasn't up to being my brother's keeper; I wasn't up to being his
finder, either.


Stan saw me steady myself on the staircase, take an extra breath,
look down.

[p. <i>214</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00221&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You're right. Wait there. I'll check 'em out first."


I heard doors opening; Sean and Dave, opening doors.


"It's okay. He's not here. I mean, it's not okay, but whatever. He's
not here," Stan reported.


"Then I'll come up."


I went up the stairs to the balcony as he flipped a switch. A small
spotlight shot its beam directly onto a mirrored ball hanging over the
stage, the lone remnant from Disco Barn all those years ago. Some
of the mirrored panels had cracked or fallen off; the few remaining
cast a watery shimmer over the stage.


It looked like we were inside a swimming pool.


"Disco Barn," escaped from my lips.


"How'd you know that? We did that too. ‘It's Raining Men.’ ‘I
Will Survive.’"


No, I wouldn't. I didn't want to be in a swimming pool, or a disco.


"Turn the spot off. I feel like I'm drowning."


He did; now we just had the light from outdoors again, as he led
me into one of the rooms.


"This is where the boys stayed. I had the top bunk over there,
and..."


He kept on talking, but I heard none of it. I was too busy looking at
a room full of people, a room that had been empty just a moment ago.
Now it was filled with the people who had been here Tim's summer:
Casey and Ray Stell and Gil and Roy coming to visit and Kent
Johnson bringing drugs and McNabb in her kimono and good Laura
Vargas who stayed out of every fight and Sarah and Carrie and Tim,
not knowing where to turn; Tim, wearing Dr. Johnny's white ice cream
suit; Tim, wearing yellow greasepaint as the Chinese stage manager;
Tim, waking up in this very room in one of the bunk beds, just like the
ones we had when we were little, and a very empty room was suddenly

[p. <i>215</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00222&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had never been there, had never seen it, but I knew.


I stood perfectly still, trying to hear the room, trying to hear Tim
through his adventures in time and space, trying to hear him give
me any clue he could manage about where he was, a letter or a
phone call....


I would settle for crumbs.


<i>My dearest Kim,</i>


<i>The stage was set for what I hoped would be a wonderful visit: you were
coming to Louisville to the New Play Festival at Actors Theatre as a VIP,
representing the Second Stage in New York. You had an official literary manager
name tag and everything. I had nothing, or at least that's the way I felt,
maybe the way I've felt ever since Mother died. I wanted to be a more "official"
part of everything than I was, instead of just a lowly little play reader.
I wanted a real-life job, a decent job, for once, like you had. I wanted to have
a stuffed avocado waiting for me, in my fancy little brown bag, just the way
you did, instead of wondering if there would be any leftovers for me. From
childhood on, I have stood by, waiting for leftovers, waiting to see if there was
any mother "left over" for me when she was done with everything else,
instead of having the confidence, the birthright, to demand my due. We just
weren't raised that way. We were too goddamn polite; maybe things would
have worked out better if Porky had never taught us those manners</i>.


<i>You looked so elegant, so sophisticated, all in black, when you jetted into
Louisville the night before the festival. I was so proud to show you off to my
friends that night. Proud of your job at Second Stage, proud of your being
at Yale, and not so proud of myself. I introduced you to my new best friend</i>

[p. <i>216</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00223&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>It was late, and we went to Zena's, the country-and-western bar behind
the theater. That was probably our first mistake, after drinking so much at
the Starving Artist Cafe at the theater. Oh, make no mistake about it; most
of our problems (and I'm talking the universal We here, not just the Powers
twins, or this Powers twin) begin when we drink too much. I can send you
an inventory of every disaster I've experienced here in Louisville, and there
will be a hefty bar bill to accompany each one</i>.


<i>After yet more drinking, we started fighting oh, so easily. All that booze
loosens tongues; we should have learned that from our father. I was drunk
and nervous; you were showing off, maybe equally nervous. You made a joke,
with some unusually bad comic timing, I thought, about Mary Lou Owens,
the costume shop manager, having had a nervous breakdown. Having had
one myself and I thought you had as well, I do not think nervous break-downs
are things to joke about, but hey, maybe that's just me</i>.


<i>In that unbearably noisy bar, I'm not sure how many people heard us
yelling at one another, but I will never forget your telling me you would never
talk to me again. All the noise in the world couldn't drown that out. You
smiled as you said it, and I think you believed it, at least for that moment.
Thank God Amy was there to come to the rescue, and drive us home. You
walked behind me with her, but I still heard her say, "Poor Timmy." Poor
Timmy, the son of a drunk, and a mother who died because she didn't love
her children enough to stay behind and take care of them</i>.


<i>I was too embarrassed to have you see my hovel of an apartment, so my
neighbor ferry let us stay at his nice big house across the street. Up that tall
and winding staircase we walked. (How many lonely, drunken walks up
staircases have I made? Too many.)</i>



[p. <i>217</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00224&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>I started crying, then, as now, and you held me. I wish that's where we
could have begun, and just skipped the middle part. When we awoke from
our fevered and troubled sleep in the morning (did either of us really sleep, I
wonder?) you dressed me in some of your beautiful clothes and everything
was alright again</i>.


<i>We continued crying for the rest of the weekend, but at least it was the
plays making us cry, not each other. You came out of seeing</i> The Value of
Names, <i>one of my favorites this year, and quoted the last line to me: "It's
not enough," and we both cried some more. There are some things that can't
be forgotten, even though you can try to forgive them</i>.


<i>"It's not enough," no matter what you do</i>.


<i>At the bank where I work, we send out coupons to tell people they are
"overdue" on a payment. Consider this letter one of those coupons; we are
"overdue" on a nice visit. I owe you one</i>.


<i>Actually, we owe each other</i>.


<i>Your brother</i>


There were too many words in my head.


There were too many memories.


There werw too many people who weren't there, and they were all
Icould see

[p. <i>218</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00225&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Stan and I were halfway down the rickety circular staircase when
I stopped. I wanted to cut into my arm or my head with a shard of
glass, as Tim had done, and let all the words and memories and
people from my past come gushing out.


But I couldn't.


It wasn't mine to do.


People weren't supposed to take their own lives.


A summer by a beautiful river wasn't supposed to make somebody
go crazy.


Not knowing who, or what, to love wasn't supposed to make you
go crazy either; having so many choices was supposed to make you
happy.


But people did go crazy, all the time.


I couldn't move.


Yes, I could. I could run away from it all, just as Tim had. I could
quit saving Tim, and just try to save myself.


Or not.


I wasn't worth saving.


I let everybody down.


I let people have breakdowns and didn't know how to save them.


I let people die because I wore the wrong clothes.


I let God down because he told me I was supposed to be my
brother's keeper and I'd turned away for a few minutes and now my
brother was missing.


I could run away to the river and throw myself in the current,
dash my head on the rocks that jutted out of the rapids and...


Bleed.


Drown.


Die.


Not have to do anything anymore.

[p. <i>219</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00226&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Just not be.


So that's what I did.


I ran past Stan, down that shaky circular staircase and onto the
stage floor. Glass from the broken windows mixed with the panels
that had fallen off the mirrored ball; they picked up the light from
outdoors and sent even more watery waves over the place.


I was drowning; water was covering me, even though I was
bone dry.


Stanley wanted a "Stella!!" from me; I'd give him one he'd never
forget.


I picked up a nice big juicy shard of glass and, yelling
"STELLA!!!" as if my very life depended on it, ran outside to the
river, to wash away my sins.


<i>Alas, Babylon:</i>


<i>I will have talked to you by now with the bad, but liberating, news of getting
fired from Actors—and to imagine, I just got the job! When Julie, my
boss, and I had our talk, it began like a scene out of Streetcar. We looked in
vain in the theater for a place to talk and decided on the balcony of the big
</i><i>auditorium. Walking up those circular stairs, I needed a nice outfit with a
bunch of artificial violets and a seahorse pin, someone to scrub and talcum
me for the leave-taking. (I've been unusually cheerful today and I think it
bothers them all. Good.) Julie found a nice dark spot. At first, I did not want
to be in any kind of darkness with her. (Save it for her husband, please.) In
some ways, she was very good: promising wonderful recommendations and
references when needed. I guess most of it boils down to group chemistry</i>.


<i>It's Tuesday now. I've weathered the storm better than I expected. In some
ways, it's easier to get out of bed now than it has been in months. I've cleaned</i>

[p. <i>220</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00227&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>I spoke last night to a library group across the river in Indiana and got paid
fifty dollars. I told them, believe it or not, about listening to Babar the Elephant
stories at the McKinney Library when we were children, when it was still in that
old house across the street from the First Baptist Church. Do you remember Mrs.
Finch and her retarded daughter Paula who always seemed to have a cold, who
lived next door to the library? Are they still living there, do you suppose? Are
they still living, period? I spoke of Stanley Green's</i> The World of Musical
Comedy, <i>which we repeatedly checked out as well. Was our childhood more
absurd than our peers, spending all of our free time in libraries and checking out
books about musicals? Or does it just seem that way now?</i>


<i>Don't know what I'll eat. Don't know where I'll stay. Don't know what I'll
do. But, you know, I'm planning on having a wonderful time. Didn't I write
that to you when I left McKinney for Louisville, a million years ago? It seems
fitting that I write it again, as I prepare for my departure to ports unknown</i>.


<i>Tim</i>


I was standing at the bluff, with a shard of glass in my hand, about to
slice away; Stan was yelling at me to stop: "Don't cut yourself!" Fool
that he was, would that stop <i>anybody</i>??? The sky was alive with
magic-hour pinks and purples and oranges, just as it had been the
morning Tim awoke to have a nervous breakdown, and...
...there he was.

[p. <i>221</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00228&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tim, in the river.


He'd been there the whole time, swimming; the rising sun had
blinded me to him.


Back and forth, as if the river had lanes, and he was doing laps. He'd
get to a certain point and pivot down and back around, like a champion.


From up above, I could see his back, tan and muscular, V-shaped,
his hair as blond as it had been when we were children.


I had found him!


I could stop running.


I could start breathing.


I could believe in God again. He would forgive me, because now
I'd found my brother, whose care had been entrusted to me.


There he was, Tim, at the one obvious place.


He had written "swimming" on his calendar, so that's what he had
done, gone back swimming to a place of such joy and heartache.


Why hadn't I believed him?


He was so beautiful down in that water, a fish, the incredible Mr.
Limpett, I didn't want to disturb him.


I'd never seen anything more beautiful.


He flipped over, backstroke now instead of breaststroke, and my
eyes adjusted even more to the play of sun and shadow on the river.
A cloud passed over the sun, and it was suddenly fall again, chilly; a
breeze rustled the pampas grass we were standing in, and I thought,
he's going to freeze, and...


...everything fell away, and it wasn't Tim.


It wasn't anybody, no matter how much I wanted it to be.


It was a phantom I had created from all the stories I had been told
of Mo Ranch, a young man who was strong and muscular and
golden and blond and young and...


...not Tim.

[p. <i>222</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00229&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The phantom of someone trying to relive the past, trying to make
believe the chill of autumn could be a hot summer's day.


This time, I didn't even cry.


I just sliced.


<i>My Kimmy:</i>


<i>It's a bright Saturday morning in McKinney, Texas, where I have taken
refuge until I figure out what to do with my life. Already today, I've seen a
young mother with three-year-old triplet sons in Wal-Mart. Each wore a
green Izod shirt and a short haircut. I stopped and said, as much to you and
Jesus as to anyone else in earshot, "Triplets!? Not tiny look-alike boys
dressed in green? Not three tiny boys, No!" I explained our twinhood to the
young mother and she said, "Were you like this?" The boys had taken tiny
toy machine guns and were stalking the store. Did they demand the justice
and beauty denied them in a fallen world?</i>


<i>I'm trying to turn it all into a big game, much the way Melba Davenport
attempted to teach nouns and verbs to the Negroes at J. L. Greer, when
we were in the sixth grade</i>.


<i>"There's a big fat noun hiding somewhere in that sentence. Pretend it's a
shiny red apple. Juicy and delicious. Find the apple! Find the apple!"</i>


<i>"Ain't no fuckin' apple here," said Omie Earle Smith</i>.


<i>Hearing the words "big" and "fat"—she would later know them as
"adjectives"—Omie had her mind set on "dick" and was pissed off to find
it was only an apple. And not really even that. A noun. The first in a series
of cruel jokes life would play on Omie Earle Smith</i>.


<i>My being back home is another cruel joke, although my spirit is surprisingly
high, given the lowly job I've found with the Parks and Recreation
Department. Didn't I have a low-level job in a greenhouse, four years ago?</i>

<i>In a fit of anxiety, I walked to the Holiday Inn the other day and joined
Lauren's, the private club there. Little private clubs, with booze (one even
hears rumor of topless waitresses in some), have sprung up all over
McKinney. Lauren's is a rather cheesy affair. An effeminate Mexican named
Joe tends bar in this particular corner of Hell. A DJ gone to pot spins country
and western tunes for the cowboys and fat women who are patrons. During
DJ breaks, Joe turns on a Dallas disco station that plays "Girls Just Wanna
Have Fuh-un" and "Let's Hear It for the Boy." ("But what he does / he
does so well/makes me wanna Yell!") The girls at Lauren's just make me
wanna yell, "Lose weight!"</i>


<i>I take refuge from everyone by swimming, a pleasure I've rediscovered for
the first time since my summer at Mo Ranch, or That Certain Summer, as
I've now taken to calling it. Here's something I wrote the other day, about
this second rebirth of mine, in the water:</i>


<i>The whistle, signaling the end of swimming, blew early</i>.


<i>"Get out of the water," said one of the more callused female guards, "It's
over." (I hear they end sex the same way.)</i>


<i>I dried off with the dignity of Bette Davis at the end of</i> Hush, Hush,
Sweet Charlotte. <i>No one was there, however, to give me a corsage or a thick
letter absolving me of my sins</i>.


<i>"Get out of the water. It's over."</i>


<i>Chuck was there, though. The most gorgeous lifeguard who ever blew a
whistle. I found out from someone that his name is Chuck, and that he will be
a high school senior this fall. Oh, Precious. He looked at me and smiled a few
times. More than once, I wanted to ask if he had any questions I might answer</i>.


<i>The other day, I did my biweekly, Parks Department—mandated cleaning</i>

[p. <i>224</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00231&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Yes, I think I did hope to find those things</i>.


<i>I found, instead, several half empty, half full (the eternal pessimist / optimist
dilemma) bottles of suntan lotion offering varying degrees of brown. I
found, as well, a pair of mirrored sunglasses. Pretending they were Chuck's
(the glasses he used to look at me, unbeknownst to the cruel eyes of those
around him), I took them, like a bandit</i>.


<i>In the course of my various disappointments, I'm trying to take life into my
own hands again, and to look at things I've been ignoring for too long. I used
to wonder why Daddy drank so much, and I realized that drinking is a thing
born of sadness. I'm looking at the way I've been acting and feel ashamed: I've
gotten off track, lost sight and perspective, become too pretentious. BIG
VICKI'S right: "You know what yo' problem is? You eats out too much." I'll
try to listen to her better next time, and cook some of my own meals</i>.


<i>For boys who bury themselves in the water, and bask in the sun,</i>


<i>Tim</i>


I held my cut arm above the river, trying to get my blood to flow
into the stream.


"See, Tim? Now <i>I</i> win. I'm bleeding too. Now we're even."


People wanted us to be the same; so be it.


As it is on earth, so shall it be in heaven.


But the flow of blood was too slow, just drops, really, so I sliced a
little bit harder, in exactly the same pattern as Tim's cut: a V-shape

[p. <i>225</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00232&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Don't cut yourself anymore. <i>Please</i> put the glass down."


That phrase again, except now Stan added a please, with his voice,
and his eyes; I could see them. But I could also see Tim, in my
memory, at my front door, holding his handiwork up for me to see.


Share and share alike.


Bleeding in front of this beautiful young boy who had tried to
help me find my brother...this muscular young mermaid I had seen
swimming, and thought was Tim.


But it hadn't been him.


It hadn't been anybody, just somebody in my head.


Enough with living in my head; I wanted out of there, where
every other thought was about Tim: how to help him, how to save
him, how to fix him.


But now, I wanted to live in my body for once, and feel things,
and let somebody else fix all the problems.


That's why my throbbing arm felt so good.


I could <i>feel</i> it, feel the nerves inside.


I could see it—the cut, the red—and know it wasn't just in my
head anymore.


It was real.


Stan spoke up "Come on, put the glass down. You're scaring me.
I'll help you. I'll get you whatever you need. We'll find help."


"But you can't find Tim. That's what you promised. You said he'd
be here, and he's not. He's not here, he's not anywhere, and I can't
go on without him."


There, I'd said it.


The truth, the hard nutshell of my life: I couldn't live without
him, no matter how much I hated him.

[p. <i>226</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00233&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I loved him more.


<i>Odi et amo</i>.


I hated and loved, each more than humanly possible.


"I've gotta keep cutting till I can count the rings inside. There
must be hundreds of 'em, just since I've come here. I'm twenty-eight,
but I feel like a hundred. I'm a sequoia. Tim made me age
faster, he's gonna kill me, gonna make me get old and die. Maybe I
can cut the rings out, let 'em flow out, be young again, then I won't
die. I don't know what else to do."


Except not fight anymore, just give in, the way Tim had, just let go.


Let the water carry me away.


Wash me away, just as it had washed Tim clean that summer.


So I threw the glass down and shimmied up the stairs of the big slide
that swooshed down into the water, like the little slide in our backyard
that swooshed down to the wading pool in which Tim had broken his
leg. Maybe I would break my leg, on top of breaking my skin.


I didn't care.


I looked like Quasimodo, scuttling up those steps, my left arm
tucked against my side, a little blossom of red against my shirt, all the
weight on my right side.


At the top of the slide there was a stack of pads to make the
descent easier. I shuffled one into position with my foot, then looked
down at the beautiful river below me, just as Tim had looked out
from his dorm window to see the school for the sham it was, seconds
before his breakdown.


Everything I saw, Tim had already seen.


It was like having your life flash before you, only the life that
flashed before my eyes was Tim's, not mine.


Fuck him.


I couldn't have anything just to myself.

[p. <i>227</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00234&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wasn't going to be afraid of the water anymore.


I was going to get baptized again.


I sat down on the pallet—


Whoa!


That baby was greased.


It almost slid out from underneath me, throwing both arms over
my head, banging them on the lip of the slide. Now I'd have a
broken wrist in addition to a cut arm.


My "WHOA" rang out over the river, bouncing back from the
cliff on the other side.


It mixed with the sounds of Stan screaming at me—or with me?
(Laughing at me, or with me? Half full, or half empty?) I couldn't tell
the difference anymore, as I plopped into the water and couldn't
hear anything, the water that went over my head instantly obliterating
any sound. Two shocks: from screams to silence, and the incredible
cold: my lungs closed up as I went into slo-mo beneath the
water.


Even when my head popped back up, I couldn't grab a breath; my
lungs were paralyzed from the cold. A fast poke of sound came flying
at me: Stan yelling at me (yes, it was <i>at</i> me, that was clear now) from
shore. But there was no time to take in the sound: the little eddies
grabbed me and carried me along.


The water was God.


I saw Stan start to wade in, but my eyes were stung by water and
blinded as I went by him.


This was a really dumb idea.


There was just time for that one quick thought.


I had been in control of cutting my wrist—I had done it, even if
some crazy chatterbox in my head was telling me to—but I was not
in control of this river. It was going to do with me what it would. Is

[p. <i>228</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00235&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was on the verge of understanding and forgiving Tim—one
thought was all I had time for, as I tried to gulp some air and not
water—when I hit a rock and FUCK, IT HURT, and now my head
was throbbing and the water suddenly felt warm and enveloping and
God is there so quickly and Stan was there, so quickly, dragging me
onto shore and I was chucking up water and he was beating on my
back and...


"That was a dumb thing to do," he said, the same as the doctor at
the emergency ward had told Tim.


Along with the burbles of water that came out of my mouth were
the strangled sounds, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."


Stan was looking at my arm, wiping off the blood. "Scare me to
death, but you can't even cut your arm right. It's just a scratch. But
you're gonnna be lucky if it doesn't get infected from all the pee-pee
and poo-poo in that water."


Pee-pee and poo-poo; my good-bye to the world, and it had
come to this.


It wasn't a deep cut, just a beaded bracelet of blood drops. I hadn't
really wanted to die, just like Tim hadn't, but his resolve had been
stronger than mine. He had dug deeper; I had just imitated the out-ward
pattern.


Tim had won, after all.


I must have said that aloud, because Stan suddenly snapped.

[p. <i>229</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00236&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Would you get over it? I don't care how fucked up your brother is.
You're as fucked up as he is to do something like that!"


He put both arms straight out and knocked me in the chest, so
much fury only now finding release. "Why'd you do that?! Why'd
you DO that! WHY'D YOU WANNA HURT ME!?? I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING TO YOU. You don't even KNOW me! You could
at least THANK me! I SAVED YOUR FUCKING LIFE!!!"


He started crying, standing above me.


He'd said what I'd wanted to say to Tim, but never had.


"Could somebody just say ‘thank you’ to me for once in my
fucking life?"


Maybe that's what this trip had come down to for Stan: he'd just
wanted somebody to notice him, to say thank you.


I took a deep breath, trying to decide what to say next, to apologize
or not, and in that breath, that moment of consciousness, I
looked at the things around me: a bleeding arm, a stranger reading
me the truth of my life, wet clothes clinging to me, Halloween in the
air, Tim not here, and...


...it was time for me to go.


Just like that; I knew.


I'd gone nuts, for no good reason. Maybe there was <i>never</i> any good
reason. I'd disrupted enough lives; I'd disrupted my own life enough,
and...


It was time to go.


That dunk in the water had cleared out my head and made me
realize what I'd been doing: running away from all the anxiety and
panic that Tim caused me in New York—maybe as much as Tim had
run away—and hiding out in the Hill Country of Texas, with a young
boy who had briefly and conveniendy allowed me to revisit my youth,
which was a comfortable place to be, because I knew everything that

[p. <i>230</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00237&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I' ve got to go.


Stan's eyes widened, even if he did temporarily hate me. "But we
haven't found him yet."


"He's not here. We both know that. I don't know where he is, but
you're right. I'm sorry I didn't thank you. You did save my life.
Really. I'd probably have frozen to death in that water."


"But where you gonna go? Where is he?"


"I don't know. I just know he's not down here. He might be dead,
I don't know. I just know I have to get back to New York. I'll keep
looking, maybe something's turned up, or..."


Or what?


"Or I'll bury him. I don't know."


Now Stan turned from seeming to want never to see me again, to
desperate that I was going. "But I can still help. I owe you. After all,
I dragged you here, which was probably a really dumb idea."


"At least I got to see it." I was trying to cheer him up, this kid who
now seemed be falling apart, after having been the strong one all night
long. "I always wanted to see it. Now I have, and it was fun meeting you."


Now <i>I</i> sounded like the idiot: "fun meeting you." If that's the best
I could come up with, the only way I could sum up what we'd just
gone through. I knew I had to go, and I didn't want to leave him,
both at the same time.


"I don't mean that. Fun's so stupid, I mean..."


For the first time, I touched him, when words wouldn't do, or
come. I pulled him to me and hugged him, feeling his face, his
breath, and somebody's tears.

[p. <i>231</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00238&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mine or his, ours; I couldn't tell.


"Don't go back."


In the hours since he'd first suggested coming here, and in the few,
ever-dwindling conversations we'd have in the years to come, it is
the closest he would ever dare to answering why he'd needed this
journey in the first place, and it was no answer at all, just three
loaded words for me to interpret.


"Don't go back."


Did that mean "Don't go back, I'm in love with you?"


"Don't go back, I never get parts at school?"


"Don't go back, I have no friends?"


"Don't go back, I'll be all alone?"


I never asked more specifically, and he never said. It was too private
to bring out into the light of day


For me, "Don't go back" meant "You're breaking my heart." This
kid whom I'd come to love, after all of one long night. This kid was me
seven years ago, facing his future, desperate to find love, as I had been.
What could I say to him, without sounding like even more of an idiot?


"You don't have anything to be sorry for. We tried, Tim tried. It's
not his fault. It just is. Things are what they are."


I couldn't hurt him.


I couldn't hurt myself anymore.


"At least I went swimming. You got me back in the water."


"It almost killed you."


"But I did it. It's stupid to be afraid of it anymore. That's something...
that's something."


I had swum again, for the first time since childhood.

[p. <i>232</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00239&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I looked great for the flight back home.


Stan led me out of the car and over to the ticket counter, where
I pulled a nearly maxed-out credit card out of a soggy wallet and
plopped it down.


He talked for me.


And then I was standing at a gate and telling him to take my rental
car back to Dallas. I was crying as he said, "Promise you won't
forget?"


"That's never been my problem."


I wanted to give him Tim's letters, I really did. I carried them in
my heart and head; I didn't need to hold them in my hands any
longer. But I just couldn't let go, not yet. They might be all I had left
of Tim.


I cried even harder and wouldn't look at him. But he forced me
to; he was now the adult, and I was the child. He said my name, with
such understanding....


"Kim."


...that he forced me to turn around and see him, to hug him, to
say good-bye. There was perfect clarity in his expression, through his
tears, the same way Tim looked swimming, in my head.


Now I wanted to be the one to say, "Don't go back," but I knew
I couldn't.


And then he was gone.

[p. <i>233</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387548-I00240&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Are you okay? Sir?"


I was on the plane, and the flight attendant was talking to me.


Maybe she thought I was afraid of flying.


She had come to offer a beverage but realized she had to offer
sympathy as well.


I looked at her; I opened my mouth but nothing came out except
tears.


"Should I call somebody?"


"There's nobody left to call."


Okay. She didn't freak out.


They taught them not to freak out.


"That blanket's wet. "They taught her not to ask what passengers
were doing with wet blankets wrapped around their shoulders.


"Would you like another one? A dry one?"


I nodded my head yes.


I was going home, but angels were watching over me.


"Blessed Virgin Mary, protect us now, and at the hour of our
deaths."


She brought me a fresh blanket, and I took a deep breath.


I was going home, to find Tim, or not.
