ABOUT TWO weeks after completing the first part of this
book, I again tried to commit suicide. In one closet of my
mind, I had been planning to do this all along, but I had kept
the door locked on it, except for what I had put down on paper.
All the time I was pretending to start a new life, I was preparing
to die. I told no one of my preparations, for I knew I would be
stopped, and this time I could not afford to be stopped, this time
I would have to succeed.


I was filled with a pervasive hopelessness. My despair and
depression were unrelieved, despite the best efforts of my therapist
who, it seemed to me, was now at a loss as to how to continue
my treatment. I had been given every antidepressant in
the book, plus a great many other psychotropic drugs, and I was
now taking an antidepressant, plus a tranquilizer on a "need"
basis, plus Antabuse, and I often felt overwhelmingly sleepy or
drugged. Lithium had been tried when there appeared to be some
remission of my depression, but because of a variety of complications,
its use had to be discontinued. If my depression never

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hospitalization was certainly not indicated; whatever repairing
and restoring had been possible there had already been accomplished,
and I desperately did not want to go back. To reappear
in those corridors would mean admitting two failures—
a failure to live and a failure to die.


Electrotherapy had made it possible for me to be somewhat
more assertive, but on the whole it had left me feeling as if I
had been through a shredder. I was bewildered, unable to move
into the new channels which had been opened. I missed alcohol
and ate huge quantities of candy, ice cream and other sweets,
and frequently not much else—a diet that certainly was not
contributing anything toward stability.


Physically, I was not feeling at all well. I was very tired most
of the time. I spent nearly every afternoon and evening in bed
and usually did not have dinner with my family; Dave did almost
all of the cooking and cleaning. I would gather together
whatever slim resources I could unearth in order to do what had
to be done, and then I would be exhausted. I wrote frenetically,
spending an hour or two each day on the book, hoping that if
I could put everything into written words, I would be rid of it.
Instead, I think that writing about my suicidal feelings reinforced
them, boxing me in with them until they became more
important, more real, more true than the alleged aim of relief.
Through all this, I lost contact with my son, and he frequently
declared that I was not his mother, that I was a witch pretending
to be his mother. I did not know how to deal with him,
and he began to have temper tantrums.


My chest became very tight, and we all thought this was
just another symptom of stress. I could not breathe fully, and
my yoga exercises left me depleted. When I closed my eyes, I
seemed to be in a car moving backward, and I felt there was no
way forward, that everything had been tried and had failed, and
I would never get well. Further, I felt that my illness had gone
on for such a long time that it had become tiresome, boring. Nobody

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I finished the book on suicide (up to April 1974), I realized
that writing it had been a failure, too. Putting everything
down on paper had not helped. The exorcism had not worked.
My therapist, seeing how things were going with me, had counselled
me to drop it, but I had refused, as I refused so much of
his advice. In that interior part of my mind which was planning
suicide, I held the book to be my final contribution, my legacy
to those who might be curious about what went on in the mind
of a suicide. Having finished it, I had nothing else to do, no more
reason for hanging around. It was "Over and Out." I would die
with the manuscript in my hand, as it were, establishing its validity
with my own death.


And so I saved pills and planned plans and told no one. For
some time my therapist had been giving me my medication in
tiny amounts. At the end of each of our semi-weekly sessions, he
would count out the number of pills I needed and put them
in a small brown envelope. He hated this procedure, and I think
he regarded it as one of the real sacrifices he made in my
interest.


I took those pills exactly as directed, for I was afraid that if I
cheated, he would somehow detect it. In this respect, I ascribed
to him the omniscience of my mother, who had convinced me
at an early age that she knew when I lied or did anything else
that went against her principles, whether she had evidence of it
or not. The night I lost my virginity (at age nineteen), she saw
the stains on my petticoat and became so enraged that she beat
me with my father's leather belt. I wonder sometimes if children
should not be allowed to tell a lie occasionally and get away
with it, just as a kind of insurance of their sense of privacy.


In addition to my therapist, however, I had another doctor.
He knew about my suicidal history and was very supportive and
sympathetic; whenever I turned up in a hospital, he was in attendance
(until the last time, when he could not be present).

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And so the day came. Why did I pick that day? I don't really
know. Everything had come together. The book was finished,
the struggle was hopeless, and I was empty. On the previous day,
I had gone to see my medical doctor about a kidney infection,
and although he did everything possible, I came away with the
feeling that he didn't care. On that day, too, I had seen my therapist,
and, as he had failed to do something I expected him to
do, I felt that he didn't care either. On the morning of the day
in question, Dave and I had seen our family therapists and I
felt they were far more concerned about Dave than they were
about me. It was a dead end.


All of this was unreasonable, of course, but reason had nothing
to do with it. I think it is rare, in our culture and at this
period in our history, for suicide or attempted suicide to be a
reasonable event. There are cases when the ravages of terminal
illness might make suicide a logical and justifiable decision, but
for most of us, the attempt to take one's life is a message of quite
another sort. In my case, it said: "I am rotten and useless. Nobody
can love me, nobody does love me, therefore I must die."


I was permeated with a profound sense of degradation, of helplessness
and hopelessness, of being boxed into a situation from
which there was no exit. My life was a trap, and I was running
around inside it in meaningless patterns that didn't go anywhere
or produce anything, and all around me was the twilight of
despair that grew ever deeper and thicker, with not even the
suggestion of a promise that there could ever be a dawn.

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was also afflicted by a kind of psychological tunnel vision
that would let me see only what I wanted to see. I knew that
people around me were trying, with a desperation equal to mine,
to open doors for me. They were handing me keys, giving me
shovels for digging, ropes for climbing, candles for seeing. But I
would not accept any of these tools. I felt that my life contained
only events, not purposes, and everything that people were trying
to do for me was essentially irrelevant.


First, I slashed my wrist with a razor blade. Although razor
blades had been taken away from me long before, I had found
one in my sewing box and hidden it under a book on my bedside
table. At about eleven o'clock in the morning, after Dave
and I returned from our family therapy session at the hospital, I
went upstairs, got the razor blade, went into the bathroom and
started hacking away.


It is a picture that I will never be able to wash out of my
mind, a scene of horror and revulsion, and I see it in slow
motion. I leaned over the sink, moaning and crying and gasping
—deep, rasping, hysterical sounds coming from an ugly well of
self-hatred within me. I attacked the veins in my wrist with the
razor blade wildly and recklessly, and the blood rose in great
blobs and fell in sickening clots into the sink; it didn't trickle or
run down the drain, it just accumulated in a thick pool like
jello, and it seemed almost as unreal. The cuts hurt, but I rejoiced
in the hurt, forcing myself to go on, and all the time
those terrible sounds erupted from my body. Yet I never struck
anything hard or deep enough to do any serious damage. Opening
a blood vessel and bleeding to death is supposed to be such
an easy thing to do, but I couldn't do it.


I don't think suicide was clearly in my mind at that point.
What I was doing was having a temper tantrum. With every
stroke of the razor, I expressed a wave of despair and grief and
anger. Up came the rage and down went the razor blade. I could
not live the way I was living, and I was powerless to change it.
All the love I had once had was gone, and I was a shell, purposeless

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But I was grieving, too—that's what the sounds were all about
—grieving for the losses of my life, the lack of purpose, the lack
of love, the lack of any sense of being. They were the sounds of
total despair—shuddering, sobbing, black. I felt driven into this
scene, and I mourned my own action. I was the judge, I was the
criminal, I was the victim. In the end, I had also to be the
executioner.


Demonstrations of anger had always been forbidden in my
family, and any feelings of anger or resentment toward my parents
were quickly suppressed. On the other hand, my mother
and father quarreled violently and often; Mother smashed the
china, and Daddy radiated rage. He was a big man and frighten-when
he was angry, whether he did anything about it or not.


Thus, when I was a child, when my anger came, it was put
down, shoved under the rug, forbidden. Now I was angry and
I let go, let it burn, let it destroy. I was angry at my therapist,
angry at my husband, angry at my son. But I could not attack
any of these things, so I attacked myself. I was insane, out of
control and not wanting control. My rage and grief enveloped
me like a flame.


Dave heard the noises I was making and came to me. He took
the razor blade out of my hand very gently and led me downstairs
to my chair. I put some kleenex over the wound, which
continued to bleed slowly. It was not deep, but it was about a
quarter of an inch wide and an inch long. Tears ran down my
cheeks, but inside I was immensely calm and remote. All the
turbulence in me was stilled, and I was merely waiting to see
what would happen next. I would not die from this wound, but
neither would I go on living as I had been. I stared out at a world
with which I no longer had any intimate relationship; I might
have been a distant cousin, or the resident of some far planet
brought here by accident, singularly detached and uninvolved, a

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dave was gravely distressed, almost frantic, and he did not
know what to do. The wound was clearly not life-threatening,
but it was nasty. More important was my total condition. I had
done what I had promised not to do. I had seemed to be getting
better, busy with things I apparently enjoyed; yet I had done this
ugly thing.


He paced the floor, rubbing his hands together, holding his
forehead, trying to see what could be done for me that had not
already been tried. "What shall I do? What can I do? I don't
know what to do," he said over and over, and I watched him
from that remote place to which I had retired and wondered why
he did not take me to the hospital to have the cuts sewn up. I
felt great contempt for what I saw as his ineffectuality, his inability
to solve my problem, and I lost interest in him.


As I watched, I realized that this was the day on which I
would commit suicide. In making this mess of my wrist, I had
done the ultimately unforgivable, had snuffed out whatever
sympathy anyone might still have for me. I could not have had
a greater sense of revulsion had I committed murder. Thus, there
was only one way for me to go, and that was out. It seemed
beautifully inevitable, and I was as serene about it as some
women are when pregnant. I had the pills; all I needed now
was the opportunity to take them. Like the impulsive murderer
who suddenly sees what he has done, I looked at my wrist and
knew I could not be forgiven. This was it, and this time I would
not fail. I was calm, very calm. All of my emotions had been
spent in the razor blade attack, and I was all intellect, coolly calculating
how soon I might get on with what had to be done.


I started moving around the house, but Dave followed me
wherever I went and I could not get to the place where I had
hidden the pills. Finally, at about one o'clock, the postman came
to the door, and while Dave was dealing with him, I went out
to the kitchen. The Fiorinal was in a cupboard behind some

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then I went upstairs to the bedroom, saying that I was tired
and wanted to lie down, a not unusual pattern of behavior for
me at that time. Therefore, Dave did not come with me. I was
afraid, however, that he might come upstairs at any moment to
check on me, and so I proceeded with the business at hand very
quietly. I had only a tiny paper cup to put water in, and I had
to refill it a great many times in order to swallow all of the
pills. There were about fifty Fiorinal tablets in the top of the
bottle, and I took those first. Then I took the other pills and
started on the aspirin. I felt that the aspirin was a kind of insurance,
the icing on the cake if you will, and I think I swallowed
about a hundred of them. I stopped only because I began
to feel sick and I was afraid I might throw up and spoil the
whole thing. Then I lay down on the bed. I was not a writer of
suicide notes. If I had been, mine would have said: "Don't forget
to feed the cats."


I really believed I would die. I thought about Dave and I
thought about our son, but they were remote figures. I knew
they would grieve, but I knew, too, that they would recover from
their grief, and I felt they would go on to better things and be
happier people because they no longer had to carry me along
as some sort of sick luggage. Quietly in my thoughts, I said
Good-bye to both of them. I also said Good-bye to my therapist,
with a deep sense of sadness and regret that I could not travel
along the road he had so optimistically shown me. And that is
the last thing I remember doing.


At two-thirty in the afternoon, we had to drive about two

[p. <i>77</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When we got home, I went upstairs to lie down again. Dave
says I stumbled a few times and he had to help me up the stairs,
but he attributed this to shock and fatigue. It was not until about
seven o'clock that evening that he became suspicious, and he
and our son checked on me. By then, of course, I was completely
unconscious, curled up on the bed, covered with sweat. Dave
called the ambulance, called the therapist saying, "She's done it
again," and called up whatever reserves he had to deal with his
agony.


I had plenty of time to die—about six hours from the time I
took the pills until Dave called the ambulance. I should have
been dead when he came upstairs to check on me. But I wasn't.
Why didn't I die when I wanted to so much? Was there something
absent from my desire, some inner reserve that would not
let me go all the way, that would not let me achieve the final
orgasm of death? I swallowed over 160 pills, and a much smaller
quantity of the principal drug involved had given rise to suspicions
of brain damage a year earlier. The thought crossed my
mind that, if I survived, it would be with a permanently damaged
brain, and who would want to live like that?


No, death was my desire. I put my very best effort into
achieving it. It had been a conscious, sober decision. No booze
was involved, and by the time I took the pills, my anger and
grief had subsided. My insanity, if that's what it was, was of a
different variety. I felt I had no right to live, but I did have a
right to die. There was no other way to go.


So I tried to die and I failed. I thought that death was optional,
but I was wrong.

[p. <i>78</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If people who try to commit suicide are people who want to
control everything, that description fits me. I was never fired
from a job, I always resigned. With one exception, every love
affair I had was terminated by me. I could not share responsibility.
On the other hand, when I found I could not control
things completely, I gave up and would have nothing to do with
them. If I could not be omnipotent, then I would be powerless.
But even in my impotence, I wanted control, so I tried to show
I could control my life by dying.


There were a lot of "ifs" in that afternoon that profoundly
affected the subsequent course of events. If Dave had taken me
to the hospital immediately after I slashed my wrist, would I
have taken the pills anyway? If, after he did take me to the
hospital someone there had recognized the strangeness of my
behavior (and I find it hard to believe that a person can walk
around literally half-asleep and not betray that condition in
some way) and had kept me there, that would have changed
significantly the treatment I received later. The tightness in my
chest turned out to be caused not by stress but by pneumonia,
and if that had been diagnosed earlier, what would have
happened?


And that is not the end of the "ifs." I have never before been
so struck by the role chance plays in our lives. But is it chance?
If I had not tried so hard to die, would I have realized how important
it is to live? I had tried and failed to die before, but this
was the first time I had put so much conscious effort into the
attempt.


What happened next was perhaps the most fateful "if" of all.
Our Sheriff's department routinely sent a deputy to accompany
every ambulance. When ambulance and deputy arrived at our
house, Dave told them I had taken an overdose of something,
he didn't know what, and asked them to take me to the same
hospital where I had so often been a patient. The deputy asked
about the bandage on my wrist and, when he heard the explanation,
said, "Twice in one day is too much. We'll take her to

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus began my encounter with the county hospital, a gray
group of structures rambling across the landscape chronologically
as well as geographically. It has all of the tubes and wires and
other paraphernalia required to maintain and repair the seriously
ill, but it offers no nutrition for the soul. In my memory, it is as
gray and grim on the inside as it is on the outside, and for a
long time it appeared in my dreams under the heading: Prison.
I lived in it for two weeks—weeks that were longer than ordinary
weeks because they contained not minutes and hours but
nightmares. There were nightmares one after another, one on top
of the other, over and under me, around me and in me. I was
in them and they were my world.


For two days I was completely unconscious in the Intensive
Care Unit. Then I was moved to the psychiatric ward, of which
my recollections are vague and uncertain. Someone asked me
the day and the date, but all I could remember was that it was
April. I knew it was April and that I was happy about it, but I
don't think I could articulate this knowledge. The same person
asked if I could remember his name. I knew that I should be
able to remember his name, but I could not bring his face into
focus. Syllables of names and faces crept around in my clouded
mind, but I could not bring one out into the daylight. On another
occasion, I threw a thermometer at a nurse because she
expressed contempt for my having put myself in this position.
Someone cheered, I think.


I also remember being tied into a wheelchair so that X-ray
pictures could be taken of my chest. I tried very hard to sit up
straight but was completely unable to do so and kept sliding
down into the chair or over the side. These X-rays revealed my
pneumonia, and I was forthwith moved from the psychiatric
unit to the medical floor. There, the doctors and nurses were
trained in strictly medical techniques, and I did not see a psychatrist
again for a week. If I found it hard to die, some old
ideas find it even harder, and the superstition that the mind and

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This attitude meant that no one was available to me to talk
about the events going on in my mind or the intense feelings I
was having. Nurses recorded my vital signs, checked the catheter,
replaced supplies of intravenous medication. Staff doctors came
to call every morning, but they never talked to me, they talked
only to each other as if I weren't there—and in a sense I wasn't.
Periodically, I was bundled into a wheelchair and carted off to
be X-rayed, a 5'7" rag doll.


To me, my physical condition was irrelevant. My life was going
on somewhere else. Because of the drug overdose, the fever
associated with the pneumonia, and the pneumonia itself, my
slow and difficult return to consciousness was a haunted and
hallucinated one. I was caught in some weird world of the mind
which projected scenes and events around me that did not exist
but were very real. If you have ever wondered which is reality
—the world you experience when you are awake or the one you
know when you dream—this was a beautiful example of that
ambiguity.


My hallucinated life, which included an entirely non-existent
time sequence, contained great vitality, warmth, color, precision
and cheer, but those fixures of my environment which anyone
else would have called real—the beds, the curtains, the walls,
the people—were fuzzy and wobbly and cold and gray. They
faded in and out of focus, indefinite and abstract, looming up in
front of me and then sliding away. Space had no meaning. The
wall might be near or distant, according to some rationale of its
own, and wherever it was, it never looked very solid. I could
have put my foot through it as if it were a cloud. My own
body, when I was aware of it at all, had an equal lack of
substance.


When I was a child, I frequently had high fevers as a result
of tonsillitis. They were always accompanied by a feeling that
the world was made of soggy bread—a very sick, thick kind of
bread that coated my tongue with some sort of gray substance I

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Soon I will wake up," I thought, "and I will be home and
everything will be all right." Neither of the worlds I perceived
could be the real one. The furniture could not be real because it
was too fuzzy and insecure. But the sharply-defined motion pictures
I saw everywhere could also not be real because they were
too fantastic. There must be some other reality somewhere. I
would wake up at any moment into the real, real world in which
I lived. I struggled toward this awakening through the colorless,
opaque curtains hanging in front of my eyes and thickening my
tongue and my mind.


Then one day Dave came to see me, and when I saw him
there beside the bed and knew that he at least was real, inside
my hallucinated world and sitting on one of those chairs that
I could not quite bring into focus, I realized I would not wake
up and find myself at home, safe and comfortable.


It was then I knew I was really here, in this place, in this bed,
into which I was locked with a belt that fastened around my
waist and tied me to the mattress. I knew I was going to have to
come to terms with that fact, motion pictures to the contrary
notwithstanding. That instant of focus on Dave's presence beside
the bed was truly awesome. I think it was the first time I
realized I was alive. He was here and I was here and life was
inescapable. "I wish I had succeeded," I said. Poor, grieving man.
How could I be so cruel?


This was when my curious misapprehension of time occurred.
It seemed to me Dave said our son was going to have a week's
vacation from school and that, because the hospital did not allow
children to visit patients, he would not be able to come and
see me. I was too confused to remember that the school schedule
included no such week's vacation. Later, when I thought about
it, I felt that Dave's failure to visit me during this "week" betrayed
a final erosion of his feeling for me. I had tried to commit

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Between Dave's visit on Friday and his next visit on the following
Monday, a whole week went by for me, a very real week,
full of events, nurses, doctors, sounds, and sights, including all
that bewildering magnificence on the wall. Prominent in this
apparent week was the old woman who occupied the bed next
to mine. She was senile and vicious, with one arm in a long
bandage which she was always trying to unravel. She would
tease me until I cried, and then she would tease me about crying.
She would pull back the curtain separating our beds and
say, "Lady." If I tried to ignore her, the soft voice saying, "Lady,
Lady," wove itself insidiously into my thoughts until I had to
look at her. As soon as she had my attention, she would do
something destructive, such as remove the intravenous needle
from her arm, knowing that I would ring for the nurse. She
tormented me unmercifully, and I gradually identified with her.
She was sick and I was sick, and we were together in our insanity.
"You're no better than I am," she would say, and I knew
she was right.


This woman actually existed, for I saw her again before I left
the hospital, but whether all of our encounters really took place,
I don't know. She was Russian, and so became for me a replica
of my crazy grandmother, except that she was more talkative
and vindictive. In her later years, my grandmother lost track of
names and always addressed me as "Lady," as if she had long
ago forsworn our relationship. The woman in the hospital repeatedly
asked my name and then refused to acknowledge that
she knew it. She tormented me day and night, until finally, in a
moment of lucidity, I told a nurse I could no longer be responsible
for her. She was then moved to another room, and I can
only be grateful to the staff for perceiving my distress—that is,
if these things really happened.


I heard many conversations up and down the hall and in

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I gave a great many parties, wore beautiful garments, and
entertained beautiful people. I lived in a great many different
houses, all imaginatively designed and decorated, with red tile
roofs, flagstone patios, oriental rugs. I sang a lot, sad songs like
"The Wild Goose Grasses." I remember once being all curled up
and humming; the nurse grew angry when she saw me, for I
was lying on the I.V. tube, cutting off the flow of medication
into my body. Also, I cried. One day, a nurse asked me why I
was crying and I said it was because I wanted to be loved.
"Please," I begged, "won't somebody love me?" I thought that
if someone would just hold me, cuddle me like an infant, I
would be all right. It did not seem such a big request, but the
nurse went away.


I was very lonely and bewildered and didn't understand anything
going on around me. Sometimes I perceived the hospital
room as in a flash of lightning. It would be illuminated briefly
and then would fade away. People I did not know appeared and
disappeared, regarding me with the cool detachment of the medical
profession, observing me, listening to my sounds.


As my periods of true consciousness lengthened, I realized
that the nurses were giving me aspirin to bring down my fever.
Considering how much aspirin was already in my system, this
was not contributing to my recovery of a sense of reality, and I
refused to take any more. On another occasion, I had a violent
headache, so severe that I could not move, but I would not accept
an analgesic for it because I was afraid to take any more

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Somewhere during the course of that non-existent week, I hit
bottom. I, who had previously sneered at such an idea. Helpless
on the bed, fever-ridden, spitting blood, unable to breathe cleanly,
I was a dreg, a bit of muck, primordial matter tossing at the
bottom of the sea. My hallucinatory world, although it was
pretty and colorful and full of song, was a world of madness, an
underwater world consisting of distortions and uncertainties. In
that undersea world, nothing was predictable, and I wanted,
more than anything, to get my head out of the water, to see
clearly again. The idea that I might be permanently trapped
down there, unable to perceive anything correctly and forever
groping for the surface, terrified me. If I stayed, I would drown,
and would have to make the massive adjustment required of a
madman, an adjustment to a world governed by no discernible
rules and forever devoid of the possibility of peace, love and
growth.


I could have stayed mad, I guess, fumbling along, with my
distortions, my obsessions, my sickness, there at the bottom of
the sea. The dreg could have remained a dreg, drifting along into
death. But, for reasons I hardly understand, the dreg decided to
grow, decided to become.


On that hospital bed, with my physical impotence almost complete
and with my mind going in and out of focus like a faulty
slide projector, I decided against dreg-ness. I can't cite day and
hour, I can't describe it as some dramatic achievement of enlightenment
or revelation, I can't declare that suddenly everything
was clear, because it wasn't like that. All I can say is that,
somewhere, somehow, deep down in my being, I changed course.


It was a very quiet, very interior thing, and not a process of
awareness at all. It just seemed to come about. Perhaps all of the
truly major events of our lives occur just as subtly: falling in
love, getting pregnant, selecting a career. The pressures are there,
pushing and pulling all the time; the influences arising from our

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In just such a strange and subtle way, during a week that
didn't exist, I altered my direction. Not all at once, and not very
dramatically. In fact, I wasn't fully aware of the change until
much later. All I knew at the time was that I wanted to go
home. I was impatient with the hospital, impatient with the
doctors and the nurses and the endless accumulation of hours
spent in bed, and I wanted out of there. I wanted to go home
where I felt I could grow, and maybe even blossom. It seemed
a simple thing, but it turned out not to be simple at all. Why
couldn't I just get out of bed and go home? Lots of reasons.


First of all, I was still sick. Even after the hallucinations
stopped, I had pneumonia to contend with, and that did not
clear up for another week.


Then there was the question of after-care. I had been admitted
on a 72-hour psychiatric hold, and although I had been in the
hospital considerably longer, I had spent very little time in the
psychiatric unit. Therefore, when I was released by the medical
doctors, I would still be referred back to the hospital psychiatrist.
When the psychiatrist finally saw me, he told me he would not
authorize my discharge until he was assured I would have adequate
after-care. This meant that if I were not released into the
care of my own psychiatrist, I would be held in the psychiatric
unit until other arrangements could be made. On both counts, I
would have to stay.


I desperately wanted to avoid a return to the psychiatric unit.
I remembered the nurse at whom I had thrown the thermometer
and wondered if all of the nurses were like that. I was afraid
to go back there, lest she still feel hostile toward me, for I knew
that a nurse could make life miserable for a patient in many
ways. What if there were other nurses who felt as she did?

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Moreover, I felt more strongly than ever that my place now
was at home, and the sooner I got there, the better. It was only
there that I could begin picking up the pieces and putting them
back in place; it was only there that I could reconstruct a useful
world for myself. Home had become the only place where I could
be restored, where my life could be confirmed, because it was
real and the hospital environment was not. I could no longer
solve my problems by being protected from them. The time for
that was gone, and I wanted to go home where my problems
were. I was ready to live.


So I considered how I was to get home. And it was here that
I became painfully aware of the absence of my therapist. As a
patient in the county hospital, I was not directly in his care.
By putting me in a county facility, the sheriff had made me a
matter of public, rather than strictly private, concern, and I
had not seen my therapist since my arrival at the hospital.


But his absence had greater significance. By trying once again
to commit suicide, I had been defying him and everything he
had done or tried to do for me. I had been saying, "Fuck you,"
in the most violent and terrible way I could think of. He had
told me that this was what I was doing, but I did not believe
him. I could not believe him. How could my self-destructive actions
be directed toward him, whom I admired, respected and
loved? How could I harbor such virulent hostility toward someone
who had been both father and mother to me, someone who
had shown me seemingly infinite compassion and understanding
and had always been there, holding out his hand, when I tried to
die? I could not accept that, I could not believe it, it wasn't true.
I even asked one of the nurses to send him a message to tell him
that it wasn't true.


But it was true. A hard, hard truth, bitter and cold and unavoidable.
A truth that every child knows and then forgets. For
the reason it was true lay in the very fact that he had, in my
eyes, been both father and mother to me, and I had endowed
him with all of their imagined power, as well as other more realistic

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Consequently, I was hurt, and I was angry, but these feelings
were too intense for me to acknowledge. I shoved them under
the rug, where they bubbled and boiled along with all the old,
long-suppressed feelings I had had toward my real parents and
never dared to express. Children frequently hate their parents
and today, at least, they are permitted to say so. I could not have
said so. On the occasions when I hated my mother, I stamped
out the feeling so ruthlessly that it ceased to exist anywhere
close to the conscious level. I could not say I hated her because
I did not feel hatred. I could not feel hatred because I would not
let myself feel it. It was far, far too dangerous. This was the real
reason for the intense hostility I felt toward Dave when I took
LSD—I had identified him not with my father but with my mother.
It was the reason for the painful anger I felt toward my therapist,
anger which I could not acknowledge. So my feelings bubbled
there under the rug and finally erupted in another, far
more destructive way.


When my mind began emerging from its disorder, I realized
only that my therapist was not there and had not been there,
and I did not know what to do. At first, I felt lost. I did not
have access to a telephone, but I sent messages to him by way of
my husband and was told that he had been in touch with the
staff psychiatrist at the hospital. When I talked with the staff
psychiatrist, he suggested that my therapist might very well decide
he could no longer be helpful to me, that we had reached
the end of the string, and that further atempts at therapy would

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I became alarmed. Going to another therapist meant reestablishing
all that faith and trust in someone else, and that would
take time. I did not want to spend that kind of time and I did
not want to make that kind of investment again. Also, I was
afraid that a new therapist would mean a new transference and
a re-enactment of the whole scene. I shuddered.


"Look," I said, "I'm not going to try to commit suicide any
more. Tell him that. For me, suicide is no longer a viable alternative."
I said these words without preparation, but as soon as
they were spoken, I knew they were true. No matter what happaned,
I would not, could not, go that route. I have since been
told that suicide is one way of coping. Not a very good way, but
a way. Well, I was going to find some other way of coping, and
I felt my own therapist could help me find that way better and
faster than some stranger. My problem was to convince him
that I was serious.


Thus was my decision expressed in words, and thus did I
come to recognize its presence. For, in a sense, it is incorrect
to say that I "made" a decision; it is far more accurate to say
that I became aware of one. I found my decision while looking
around for a way to re-establish contact with my therapist. It
had been lying there waiting for me, unperceived until I stumbled
over it that morning. Then, it rose up in me like a wave
cresting in the sea, having all the authority of a religious conversion.
It was a conviction born somewhere deep inside of me,
and it was total. My life would now be devoted to living.


Now I had a new problem. Although I knew the sincerity of
my decision, I had trouble conveying it to others. How many
times had people heard me say that I was sorry, that I felt like
a heel, that I didn't want to do that again, that I would try
harder? To the world, I still sounded like a reformed alcoholic

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dave believed me. At least, he tried to, probably because he
needed to. He came to see me every day (having missed that
mysterious week, which existed in my mind but not on the
calendar), and I waited eagerly for his visits. I was keenly aware
of his love for me; he brought it to me every day at the hospital
as a kind of radiance which, even when he was not there, gave
me strength.


I had stopped believing in love at some point. "Love," I had
said, "is not enough. You are not enough. You are weak, you
are like my father, you are inadequate to my needs." Now, however,
I saw that Dave's strength was of a variety not often found.
He was like a rock that could not be ground down. During all
the months of my illness, the weeks of hospitalization, the repeated
suicide attempts, the inability to function, and my obvious
loss of faith in him, he remained solid, always there, his
very immobility an asset. My expectations of him, like my expectations
of my therapist, had been impossible of fulfillment.
At the time of our marriage, Dave had been a prime mover, a
do-er, an act-or, a person of enormous vitality. When he ceased
being these things, I put him down as someone of no consequence,
just as I put myself down as non-existent. More, I
thought his loss of vitality was somehow my fault, and in hating
myself for having done this to him, I also hated him for having
let me do it.


Now my days centered on his visits, for he was my only link
with the outside world, the world I wanted to re-enter as a full
citizen. I realized his strength, and I realized his love, a love
that had abided quietly, waiting for me to get well, always holding
onto the belief that I would get well. Dave's love was the
kind that gives the beloved freedom. He never put a fence
around me, never tried to make my decisions for me, always

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I came home from the hospital, the statement, "Dave
loves me," was one of the supports I clung to when the going
got rough. His giving me room to find out who I was and then
to be who I was, even at the risk that I might ultimately reject
him, was a significant factor in my recovery.


In the beginning, Dave was the only person who believed me.
Others were skeptical. My son, for example, when I finally saw
him and told him I would no longer try to commit suicide, dismissed
my assertions with: "Suicide is a household word at our
house." The hospital psychiatrist said merely that such a conversion
was "possible," and that the first person I had to convince
was myself.


But the person I most wanted to convince was my therapist,
and I had my opportunity when he came to see me at the hospital.
As soon as he walked into the room, however, I saw that
he was not going to be kind, receptive and accepting, willing to
go along with anything I suggested. His face was grim, and his
eyes regarded me without warmth. He was very much the father
figure at that moment, the father to whom I had said "Fuck
you" once too often, and I knew that none of my skill with
words would persuade him, as it had so often persuaded others to
do what I wanted them to do: the rabbi who really didn't want
to convert me to Judaism, the psychiatrist who really didn't
want to give me LSD, my mother who really didn't want me to
leave home and go to New York.


But I talked anyway, trying to put all my hopes and fears into
language, and hoping that the strength of my conviction would
be communicated to him in other ways as well. I wanted not to
cajole him into doing something against his will, but to convince
him of my sincerity. My conversion was certain, but there were
wobbles all around me. My recovery would be so much simpler
and faster if it could be accomplished with his assistance, because

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He listened for about an hour, and in the end he said, "I don't
know. We've been through all this before, and I don't know if
I can continue to be useful to you as a therapist. After all, your
life is at stake." He meant, of course, that if I continued to act
out my hostility in a suicidal manner, I might very well succeed
in dying. If some accidents are really suicides, some suicides
are really accidents. I had been going down a path that could
have only one end.


He said he would have to think about it further. This was
Wednesday afternoon, and he told me he would let me know
his decision by the time I was ready to be released from the
medical ward. In that way, I would know whether I could go
straight home or would have to return to the psychiatric unit.


I thought I would be ready to be discharged on Friday, but
on Thursday, I suffered a relapse. My temperature went up, and
the X-rays showed that my lungs were still congested. My white
blood cell count wasn't right, either. The doctor shook his head,
"You can't leave yet." "Why not?" I cried in annoyance. He
smiled with that kind of forbearing patience and lack of understanding
that some doctors must learn in medical school. "You're
still sick," he said.


I chafed, and waited. Healing can take a long time, proceeding
on several levels, which don't always move in the same direction
at the same pace. Part of me was well and ready for the
world, but other parts were trailing behind.


I waited all day Thursday. And all day Friday. And all day
Saturday. And all day Sunday. I waited all those nights, too, for
I could not sleep. The occupant of the room across the hall played
his television set until eleven o'clock every night, and the sounds

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The daytime was little better, except that there were more
sounds in it. The nurses, though sympathetic, were much too
busy for idle conversation, so I made friends with the young
man who mopped the floor, a fairly articulate person who was
marking time before deciding which way his life was going to
go. He told me that when I was first brought to the medical
ward, I slept all of the time. Sleep? So that's what it looked like.


Now and then, I was able to take a short walk, and once a
student nurse untangled the threads of the I.V. equipment sufficiently
to enable me to take a bath and wash my hair. Then
it was discovered that I had some sort of scalp infection (which
did not clear up completely for months). The hospital doctor
who diagnosed it as dermatitis asked: "Is your health good?"


Food was served at prescribed intervals but was generally
tasteless and unappealing. Why should I need food, I thought,
when I wasn't doing anything? I ate, but eating was a chore.


The minutes passed. Time dripped slowly, and each drop was
a globule of boredom and frustration. The doctors continued to
shake their heads, and there was no word from my therapist.

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I love you," I said to Dave one day when he came to visit
me, and he wept. The fact that I could say those words confirmed
the change in me more than anything else, and he knew it. I
think it was then that he really began to hope again.


I got better. The tubes were detached, the belt unfastened. I
walked farther and for longer periods, pushing strength back into
my body. I was able to read for brief intervals. A friend had
given me William James' <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>,
and reading it was to help, in a major way, to corroborate my
new point of view toward life.


My ability to focus, however, continued to fluctuate, and I
frequently felt myself sipping into some other world where I did
not want to be. There were times when I held on to the side rails
of the bed to reassure myself that I was not drowning. This sporadic
loss of reality frightened me; I was afraid of what I might
do during one of those episodes.


On Friday, I was able to get to a public telephone, and I called
my therapist's office to leave a message stating that I would be
willing to continue therapy without medication, thereby completely
eliminating the possibility that I might misuse drugs he
prescribed for me. I felt it was essential to demonstrate to him
the validity of my change in direction.


By Sunday, the doctor could no longer detect signs of pneumonia
in my lungs. On Monday, he said I could leave, but
where I would go was up to the psychiatrists. There was no message
from either of them, and I wandered around all morning
trying not to think. What would I do if I had to remain in the
hospital? What could I do? It seemed such a waste of time.


For the first time in two weeks, I got dressed. I was very thin,

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Noon and lunch made their appearance. I ate, because time
passes when you eat. Not much, but a little. It's surprising how
little time eating takes, considering how important it is. I walked
up and down the corridor. All around me were sick people and
busy nurses. Everyone must know I did not belong here, but
when would the message come? Had I been forgotten?


I went back to my room and waited, looking at the tips of
my fingers, at the surface of the walls. I had spent an entire lifetime
in this room, and now I was ready to leave. It had been a
kind of womb, but now I needed to be born.


If the message is delivered by one of the nurses, I thought, it
will mean I have to go to the psychiatric unit, but if the hospital
psychiatrist delivers it in person, it will mean I am being
discharged.


At two-fifteen, the psychiatrist came through the doorway,
crossed the floor, and sat down on the bed next to mine. He
smiled, and I knew what the message was. "You can go home.
You have an appointment with your therapist tomorrow at four-thirty."


Home. I could have hugged him. Home. "Thank you," I said,
and ran down the hall to the public phone. Home. I dialed the
number and Dave answered. "I'll have to shave," he said. "Don't
shave!" I cried. A woman sitting nearby looked up and smiled.
Returning her smile, I started to cry. "I'm coming home," I wept.
"I'm coming <i>home</i>. There's no time to shave."


The hospital was about fifteen miles from our house, and
Dave and our son did not arrive until almost three o'clock, but

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Our son was excruciatingly casual. He would not let me hug
him, and acted as if taking me home were a matter of small imporance.
After all, why not? This had all happened before.
Momma tried to commit suicide, Momma went to the hospital
in an ambulance. Momma came home, contrite and apparently
better. It had been going on for a year-and-a-half, and he had no
reason to suppose that this time was any different. In the car,
he showed me a card trick and finally put his arm around my
shoulders. The touch of that arm was one of the sweetest I had
ever felt. Could he dare to love me again? Could he dare to trust
me? He remained aloof for some days, and he suffered from a
deep unease. To him as to my husband, I had to demonstrate,
morning by morning and encounter by encounter, that I was in
truth a member of the family, and that I intended my presence
to be permanent.


Coming home was no grand solution. On that first afternoon,
I discovered that the feeling of going out of focus was not a
function of the hospital environment. One minute, everything
was sharp and clear and beautiful, the next it would blur and
grow hazy, and I would start sliding away from here into somewhere
else. It was as if reality were pulsing, but not in any predictable
way, for when things drifted away from me, I could not
be certain they would return. "I'm here," I would say to myself,
"I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. I mustn't let go, not for a
minute. Dave loves me, our son loves me, they both need me,
and I am something. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here." But often I
felt as if I were on a shaky suspension bridge strung out over a
deep chasm; there was only a thin rope to hold onto, and the

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the beginning, I could not think of the past, I could only
concentrate on here and now, taking one step at a time, a new
person learning to walk. As might be expected, that walking was
pretty unsteady, physically as well as mentally. For weeks, my
hands shook so much that I could not write legibly or hold a
paint-brush, and I had to be careful when I lifted a teacup to my
mouth. Working around the house, which had deteriorated terribly
during my illness, I got tired now and then, but I would
not lie down for any reason until bedtime.


To lie down, or even admit that I felt tired, would have been
pushing everybody's panic button. Fatigue—constant fatigue, unrelenting
and irremediable—had been one of the symptoms of
my illness. Now, if I said, "I'm tired, I'll do that in a minute,"
Dave and our son looked at me in alarm. Is she getting sick
again? Are we in for another repeat? I was keenly aware of their
concern and took my brief rests when no one would notice.
Later, when I was more secure, I protested that everyone had a
right to get tired, that even metal suffers fatigue. "I get so scared,"
Dave said. "I don't know what I'd do if you got depressed again."
He watched me carefully, and I had to be certain he knew where
I was and what I was doing every minute of the day.


I was busy, and wanted to be that way—around the house, in
town, here and there exploring. Doors were opening on all sides,
and I wanted to look through each one of them. Oddly enough,
although I was weak from the pneumonia, I had more energy
than before going into the hospital. It was as if some new source
of energy had become available to me, and I could now investigate
more of the possibilities presented. I had always been a lowenergy
person, and either could not do some of the things I
wanted to do because I was too tired or did them with the assistance
of alcohol. This latter solution wasn't much good because,
when the alcohol dissipated, the fatigue rushed back in
double measure. So, I might be able to save today, but it would
be at the expense of tomorrow. I thnk it entirely possible that

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I began writing poetry again, with a different kind of awareness.
"Today is a poem," I wrote, describing my happiness in
the little things that occupy a day. When I was in focus, I could
concentrate on the little things and find abundant peace and
beauty in them. They were a song of joy that surrounded me, a
flow of life with neither beginning nor ending. I sang a lot and
cried a lot, not because I was sad or felt unloved, but because I
knew myself to be a part of love and was no longer bound. I
was free to choose life; I didn't need death any more.


Not that I always saw things from that bright a pinnacle—
the down places were pretty low, and I was often unsure of my
direction. But at least, when I lost my focus, I could remember
the joy and know it existed, gradually incorporating it more and
more firmly into my life.


Some of this, I suppose, was due to the residue of drugs in my
system, but it also reminded me of the way I had felt after I
took LSD. My experience in the hospital had all of the earmarks
of a full-blown psychedelic adventure, and I was now having to
repair the boundaries between conscious and unconscious, a repair
that is necessary if one is to function in society. But this
time, while repairing boundaries, I was going to try to understand
them. I would not just put the lid on and put a stop to
the whole thing. That had been necessary before, but the result
was that the stuff in the pot continued to bubble and ferment
until it almost destroyed me.


Often I was scared, really scared. I was afraid I would "go
insane," lose control, and do something to harm myself. Thoughts
of suicide tormented me. I read about a woman who jumped off
a bridge, and I thought, "I could do that." When I tried to put
this thought aside, it became more intense, and so I tried to deal
with it in another way. I imagined myself walking across the
bridge in question. I saw myself stop in the middle and look over
the side into the chasm below, and then I deliberately turned and

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then there was the matter of the suicide note I did not write:
"Don't forget to feed the cats." We feed our two cats raw kidney.
When we shop, we buy a week's supply, cut it up, and
freeze it. Every afternoon, one portion must be removed from
the freezer to thaw in time for the cats' dinner. This was a
task I usually remembered and Dave usually forgot. Thus, when
I was getting ready to die, I was concerned that the meat would
not be taken out of the freezer, and the cats would starve. You
may think this shows a strange sense of proportion, but suicidal
thinking is not especially noted for its clarity.


At any rate, I wanted to remind my family to feed the cats
when I was no longer around, and this thought came back to
haunt me during the weeks following my return from the county
hospital. If I neglected to take the cat food out of the freezer in
time for their dinner, I became alarmed. Did that mean some
underground current in my mind was moving toward suicide
again? Did that mean thoughts of suicide were still alive and
well somewhere?


My manuscript on suicide lay beside my typewriter, but I
would not look at it, could not look at it. I was afraid that if
I read it, I might get caught in that kind of thinking again. I
wondered if I would ever be able to look at it or tolerate exposure
to negative thinking again. When I mentioned it to people
who were interested in my welfare, they all gently suggested I
forget it. Perhaps, I thought, I would always have to live with a
wary eye toward the beginning of a dark thought, much as the
alcoholic lives with a constant prohibition of that first drink.


When I lay awake at night, tortured by fear and questioning
whether I would ever come all the way up out of the water,
whether I would ever feel solid inside myself again, I drew
strength from the knowledge that I had no suicide plan. In the

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In those early months, I often had the feeling that the path
in front of me constantly forked, that every waking moment required
a new choice. One road led to stability and self-acceptance,
the other to disorder and death. And my choice could not
be taken for granted; it required relentless vigilance. "I can go
either way with this," I said one day to the therapist, "and I don't
know which way to go." "Yes you do," he replied. And when I
consulted myself, I found he was right; I did know.


There are times, however, when consulting yourself doesn't
seem to work, because you are in unfamiliar territory and don't
recognize the signs. I had a tendency to repeat past mistakes,
bad habits of thought which had accrued over such a long period
that I did not know they were there. My therapist came down
hard on me when he saw that I was slipping into those old patterns.
For example, I had to have things be a certain way, regardless
of the facts. Always, I had refused to accept some of
the circumstances of my life, such as Dave's illness, insisting
that they did not exist. If you order black coffee in a restaurant
and the waitress puts sugar in it, there are several things you
can do. You can drink it anyway, you can send it back and
ask for another cup of coffee, or you can walk away from it. I refused
to do any of those things. I insisted that somebody, somehow,
take the sugar out of the coffee. The fact that it could not
be done was irrelevant. If it were not done, I would kill myself.


Up to a point, such behavior might be called willfulness, the
attitude of a child who will have a bicycle for his birthday, no
matter how often it is explained that there is no money for the
bicycle. In my case, the determination became obsessive: I would
have Dave be as he was when I married him—exactly that and
no other way. I would not leave him, I would not adjust to the

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This kind of thinking was carried to its logical conclusion in
my obsession with suicide. While I was suicidal, any suggestion
that I could get better or that there were alternatives was almost
automatically transformed into a reason for killing myself. The
road I walked went only one way, and signs pointing out roads
going in other directions were not only ignored, they were not
even seen.


Thus, obsessive thinking about one thing could lead to obsessive
thinking about another and far more dangerous ambition,
and had to be stopped. Okay, you say, don't think that way any
more. Simple? Not simple. Not at all. First, you have to identify
such a thought pattern, and that is perhaps the hardest part. We
learn to think much as we learn to walk. At first, we are keenly
aware of every tiny muscle that must be engaged and mobilized
to produce the desired result, but as soon as the whole thing
has been accomplished and coordinated, we refer it to some automatic
monitoring system which thenceforth handles the entire
operation. If, in this learning process, an error creeps in, throwing
us slightly off balance or contributing an element of awkwardness
to our gait, that too will be incorporated more or less
permanently unless something radical happens to force us to
change it. You walk as you walk, but if you were asked to specify
the muscles involved, you would be unable to do so.


Thinking patterns are equally difficult to identify, to isolate
and examine. Moreover, we do not want to examine them, much
less change them. They belong to us, like that old, comfortable
chair we have been sitting in for so many years that it is molded
to our contours. The trouble for me was that the chair I had
been using had thrown my body out of alignment.


Learning is tough. It requires stretching, it requires revising,
and, in some cases, it requires surgery. It hurts. It hurts hard.

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And so, kicking and screaming, I learned—learned to spot the
obsessive pattern, chop it up and divert it, whether it was about
jumping off a bridge or how to get the sink unplugged. At one
point, I even found that I was thinking obsessively about thinking
obsessively.


I also learned that no one was going to take care of me.
Mother, in the person of my therapist, was not going to take me
in her arms and cuddle me, protecting me from danger. "I want
to be loved," I had told the nurse, meaning that I wanted to be
cradled, crooned over, and made well. I had thought by some
magic my therapist could do this, because, after all, wasn't he
the ideal combination: mother/father/doctor/God? I said as
much one bright June day when I sat in his office. He shook
his head, saying gently, "That's not my function."


Not take care of me? The recognition of this simple fact was
brutal. If he didn't, who would? Who could? If no one took care
of me, I would perish, sliding back down that road into despair.
Stunned, I left his office and drove over to my son's school to
wait for him. Arriving early, I sat in the car, trembling and
clutching the steering wheel. The trees were newly green and I
counted the leaves; a mocking bird was singing and I listened
intently, trying to memorize the notes. No one was going to
take care of me. The therapist was not my mother, and my
mother was dead. The sun shone on the leaves, on the windshield,
on the song of the mocking bird, but it did not shine on
me. I was sick and alone and no one was going to take care of
me. Afraid I would not survive that knowledge, I could only
hang onto the steering wheel.


Then my son got into the car. "Hi, Mom. What's the matter?"
I looked at him and touched his cheek. I was not alone, and I

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I was a child, my mother took my feelings away from
me. That sounds impossible, but it isn't. She did it, first, by identifying
my feelings for me before I had a chance to identify
them for myself. "You're angry," she would say accusingly. "No,
I'm not," I would reply, and to prove it I would stifle my anger
just to demonstrate that she was wrong. This led to confusion in
identifying real feelings. She also tried to protect me from my
feelings, saying such things as: "I wish I could feel your hurt
for you, so that you wouldn't have to feel it." This sounds compassionate,
but in effect it deprived me not only of my pain
but also of my right to pain. I grew up with the idea that my
pain wasn't real, that she (or someone else) could magically feel
my pain for me, so that I could move along comfortably insulated
from it.


Thus, I had to re-learn my feelings, and in the process discover
that my pain was my own, that there was no one anywhere
who could bear it for me. Pain, I found, is necessary for
growth.


Growing is not a steady progression from here to there, occurring
as neatly as a highway from one town to the next; it is
a matter of chunks and hunks which often accrue underground
and then burst forth to show us what we have learned. The
process also involves waste and discard and separation and therefore
hurts. My separation from my mother when I first went
away to college had been disastrous. I now faced a different kind
of separation: the necessary separation of mother and son. Although
my son was not about to leave home, he was struggling
to establish personal independence, and I had to learn to let him
do that. In the past, when I had said, "Okay, do it your way,"
I had meant, "Okay, do it your way as long as you end up doing
it my way."


The first step I had to take was to realize I didn't have to take

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That required recognizing him as a separate person, with
thoughts, feelings, plans and experiences all his own. This was
surprisingly difficult. I knew intellectually what I had to do, but
confirming it emotionally was another matter. I did not want to
let go of him. I wanted to keep him close under my heart, as if
he were still in my womb and I had a right to know his private
life because it was fed by me. He was born by Caesarean Section,
as my body was not preparing itself for natural childbirth
when it was due, and I wonder if, even then, I was refusing to
let him go.


The separation was essential, however, no matter how much
it hurt. It was like having my skin peeled off, layer by layer, but
I gained something far more valuable than what I thought I was
losing. I gained love, and I gained respect. In accepting my son
as a separate person, no longer bound to me, I affirmed not only
his individuality, but also my own. It was another step in learning
my freedom to be.


I observed many "anniversaries." Every day of survival was a
triumph. I could say, Look at that! Four days, five days, six days
out of the hospital. Then it was weeks. And finally months.
These observations marked not only time but progress, for although
I could not see my recovery in the transition from one
day to the next, I could see it when I compared this week with
two weeks ago. My ups were more consistent; my downs did not
dip so low; my focus was maintained for longer and longer
periods.


In August, we went back to Colorado, where I visited my
father, finding I had lost much of my previous rancor toward
him and could regard him as a person apart from whatever role
he had played as my father. I could feel compassion for the
problems he faced and enjoy his recollections. It was a tremendous

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The experience had its negative aspect as well. While we were
there, I decided to cook a meal for my father—and burned my
hand severely on hot grease. Although I put my hand in cool
water immediately, we finally had to go to the local hospital for
treatment. As the doctor inspected my hand, tears were streaming
down my face. Thinking they expressed pain, he offered me
some codeine, but I was not crying because my hand hurt; I was
crying over being in another emergency room. I consoled myself
by recalling that I was fully conscious and that I would not have
to stay there.


In the circumstances, burning my hand was no idle accident.
It indicated to me that I really did not want to play this role
with my father. I did not want to assume the duties of my
mother, did not want to serve him. Understanding this made me
sad, for it meant that I had not yet fully accepted the past. As
with the pneumonia, healing had occurred on some levels but
not on others.


I was more than triumphant when I got through September.
Only a year before, I had taken a massive overdose of pills and
lain in a coma for three days. If the "death experience" of prolonged
and deep unconsciousness can transform a soul, those
three days should have done it. Also, my therapist was at the
hospital, helping, from the time I arrived, making it a classic
instance of attempted suicide from which I was rescued by my
therapist. There have been cases where such circumstances resulted
in a dramatic recovery, but no real change occurred in me.


Why not? I just wasn't ready yet. For one thing, I was drunk
when I took the pills and do not recall swallowing them. I remember
making the plan. Dave and I were taking the same
medication, a combination of a tranquilizer and an antidepressant,
and both prescriptions, as it happened, were refilled on the
same day. Thus, there were almost 150 pills on hand. I intended

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I faced the new September with some trepidation. It was a
month of change. Would it change me? Would my upward spiral
falter under the stresses of the season and the plunge toward
Christmas? I wrote about beginnings and how they interlock
with endings, and picked my way through the days as if I were
walking on a tiny, narrow path set in a treacherous landscape.


The day my son went back to school, I felt very lonely. His
school world was his own, and I was shut out of it. A friend
told me recently that he would like to do his own thing if he
could just figure out what it was, and I was in danger of feeling
the same way. The days were waiting to be filled, and I hesitated
before their emptiness. Then I saw that every detail of daily
life, no matter how trivial, is open to extensive exploration and
will yield its own meaning if you poke into it long enough. I
began work on a long-term writing project.


When I passed the anniversary of that near-fatal suicide attempt,
surviving a repetition of the circumstances which had
triggered it, I knew I was safe, and I could survey the remainder
of the year not only calmly but with enthusiasm. I gained confidence
in my ability to survive, and survival itself became something
special, even glorious. For a brief time, the Christmas season
appeared ominous and I thought: In all this madness, there
isn't any place for me, there isn't any little corner to which I
can retreat and restore myself. But I was able to sort it out, put it
in perspective; I found the little space I needed inside myself.
Christmas became beautiful, because, no matter how busy I was,
no matter how much I felt I was a tool of the season, I knew
that in my heart I was at peace.

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On New Year's Day, I called my sister to say, "I made it."
There are many beautiful words in the English langauge, but
those three, at that moment, were made of solid gold and were
as large as the universe.


I made it, and I made it without alcohol. The day I came
home from the hospital, Dave offered me a drink, part of our ritual
of celebration, without which no event in our lives, whether
momentous or trivial, could be confirmed. I took two swallows
and knew it was not for me. My highly unstable mind could not
tolerate alcohol; the fuzziness it induced almost immediately
scared hell out of me. I had enough involuntary blurring without
deliberately courting it. I put the glass down and thought,
"Maybe some day I'll be able to drink normally, but not now."


I guess that's the dream of every alcoholic: Some day I'll be
able to drink normally. Every day we try and every day normality
eludes us. The day I can drink normally has not come, and
it never will. I like the taste of alcohol, and I like the idea of
drinking, but I just cannot drink. When I order a glass of wine
with dinner, I drink about a third of it, and that is all I want.
I don't like the effect of even that small amount. I used to think
people who didn't drink were pretty dull sorts who didn't know
what they were missing and were unwilling to find out. I know
what I'm missing, and it is a country which no longer appeals
to me. I thought I needed alcohol to relax before a party or to
have a good time at one; I needed alcohol to boost my energy
or get my day going; I needed alcohol to be more friendly or
more clever or more interesting. I don't feel those needs any
longer, and for me, the side effects of alcohol are losses.


I no longer enjoy drinking, and I guess the real question is:
Why? I'm not sure I have the answer to that. When I was pregnant,
I quit smoking because nicotine decreases the amount of
oxygen in the bloodstream, thereby raising the specter of brain
damage to the unborn child. I had smoked three packs a day,
but I cut down to six cigarettes or less, thinking all the time
that, as soon as the baby was born, I would take up smoking

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The baby was born, but I did not resume my previous smoking
pattern, because I couldn't. My craving was extreme, but
when I lit a cigarette, I could take only two or three puffs and
then I would have to put it out, because it tasted so terrible.
More than terrible. Repulsive. For at least two years, I tried to
smoke again and could not.


The real barrier, however, may have been something else. In
the hospital, I had discovered that my keenest desire for a cigarette
came when the baby was brought in to nurse at my breast.
This association between breast-sucking and cigarette-smoking
upset me. It seemed to me I wanted to smoke because I wanted
to be a baby again. Cigarettes were substitutes for nipples or
thumbs. At the same time, my attitude toward breast-feeding was
ambivalent. I wanted to nurse my baby but could never provide
enough milk. By the time he was a month old, I had to put him
on bottles. I suspect I was a reluctant nurser because I did not
want to be like my own mother, who had nursed me until I was
almost a year old. In any case, I did not want to have anything
to do with breast-sucking, real or surrogate, and I could no longer
enjoy smoking, no matter how much my body demanded it.


The decision about alcohol was not so obvious. It had been
clear for some time that alcohol was bad for me, that it encouraged
my suicidal impulses and increased rather than alleviated
my despair. Alcohol had been a factor in all but the first and the
last of my suicide attempts. On one occasion—when I used carbon
monoxide—I purposely got drunk in order to carry out my
suicide plan.


But alcohol served other aims. I drank to get drunk, to hide,
to escape. Alcohol blurred my pain and gave me a little lift,
however temporarily. Although I did not go on binges, I was
an alcoholic. Openly, I drank a great deal every day, but I also
sneaked drinks whenever I could. The Madeira and the sherry
we bought for cooking usually bypassed the cooking process on
the way into my stomach. My ideal day began with a glass of

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Like suicide, alcohol is a way of coping. Not a very good one,
but something. My father could probably not survive without it.
Blood chemistry is involved in the composition of an alcoholic,
to be sure, but the psychological factors must also be present.
I wanted, needed alcohol at that time, and no amount of intellectual
persuasion could make any difference. Now, neither my
body nor my psyche require this support, and, once again, reason
has nothing to do with it. We think we are reasonable creatures,
but reason must be allied with other forces within us before the
whole person will turn.


I had to do my turning without the help of medication. Although
the proposal that I go without drugs had originally been
mine, I did not realize this embargo would have to be total. On
my first night home from the hospital, I took a sleeping pill. I
had not slept much while hospitalized, and I thought perhaps
one good night's sleep was all I needed to put everything right
and hold the focus in reality. How I missed those sleeping pills
in the round-up of drugs for my suicide attempt, I don't know,
but there were three of them in a bottle, and I took one. I slept
all right, but when the alarm went off the next morning, I didn't
know where I was or who I was or even what I was. I was so
confused that I could not distinguish between the floor and the
ceiling. Dave finally shut off the alarm and said, "Aren't you
going to get up?" "In a minute," I said, and slowly, agonizingly
summoned myself unto myself and got out of bed. No more
sleeping pills.


In succeeding weeks, I sometimes slept no more than two hours
a night. My therapist and I explored the subject of insomnia at
some length, and there are lots of theories and lots of solutions,

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A few days after my bout with the sleeping pill, I got a severe
headache and took an aspirin. One aspirin. In half an hour, I
was in never-land, and the living room in which I was sitting
turned to mush. All I could do was sit quietly and wait for the
effects to wear off. I was terribly frightened that a single aspirin
could have so profound a consequence. Obviously, I was still
extraordinarily susceptible to drugs. Equally obviously, I would
have to find some other way of dealing with headaches.


There is something about pain in my head that is far more
threatening than pain in any other part of my body. My head
is where I live. When pain invades it—the heavy, throbbing,
burning pain of a severe headache—my entire presence seems to
be in danger. In the past, I had taken heavy drugs for headaches:
Codeine, Fiorinal, Demerol, Darvon. Usually they did not affect
the headache, but, even when they did, they spaced me out.
This was particularly true of Codeine. Thus, as my headache
subsided, so did my contact with reality.


In my new circumstances, loss of reality was more to be feared
than the pain of a headache. Even after my vulnerability to drugs
wore off, my therapist and I decided we would explore other
ways of dealing with my headaches. Consequently, I have been
forced to try to understand them, to examine the circumstances

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the case of my headaches, I have made many discoveries
with the aid of biofeedback training. Muscle tension is sometimes
involved, for example. I feel the pain in my head, but the
muscles which trigger that pain are in my neck and shoulders.
Learning to relax those muscles has virtually eliminated that
type of headache. There is also a vascular component; the blood
vessels in the scalp swell and become engorged with blood. It
has been found that people who suffer from vascular headaches
have a marked difference in temperature between the skin of
the forehead and the skin of the hands. (Maybe the saying should
be: Cold hands, warm head.) So, I have been learning to increase
the temperature of my hands through biofeedback. At the same
time, I am learning not to be afraid of headaches, much as I
learned not to be afraid of sleeplessness. As a result, they no
longer wipe me out as they once did.


Other problems which drugs might have alleviated still plagued
me. My anxiety level was so high that it rattled my teeth. Certainly,
no one was going to give me a tranquillizer, so I did not
ask for one. Gritting those rattling teeth as best I could, I took
my one step at a time in the here and now. When I was not too
frightened, I tried to track my anxiety down to its source. Some
of those first discoveries were truly illuminating.


There was my discomfort about having people depend on me.
All my life, whenever anyone became dependent on me, I cut
out. That was the real reason I left my first husband—his dependence
stifled me. I think I would have left Dave had it not
been for our son, but the presence of a dependent child created

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the time, I did not realize it was the dependence of both
husband and son that was oppressing me. All I knew was that
I couldn't stay and I couldn't go. I was caged like some animal
and did not know how to open the gate. So I took the only way
that was visible to me, over and over and over, trying to force a
change in a situation I had helped create but could not tolerate.
It is a curious pattern, in which I say: You must rely on me, but
if you do, I shall resent it.


I had a kind of eclectic amnesia. In the first part of this book,
I wrote that electrotherapy had not affected my memory much,
but I am not sure that is true. I began bumping into situations
where other people remembered events I did not remember, although
I had participated in them. My sister reminded me of a
trip we made together. I remembered nothing about it, although
it lasted for two days. Not the faintest glimmer of a picture came
to my mind when she discussed that trip.


On another occasion, my son and I met a friend for lunch in
a restaurant I thought I had never seen before. As we walked in,
he said, "Oh, I've eaten here before." "When?" I asked in surprise.
"Last summer," he replied, "with you and two of your
friends. We went to an art gallery afterwards." The restaurant
and the circumstances were totally unfamiliar to me.


This memory loss is not the same as ordinary forgetting. When
you forget something and someone reminds you of it, you then
recall it. Your memory of it may not be the same as the other
person's, but at least you can identify it. My forgetting was of a
different order. My feeling about the trip with my sister, the
visit to the restaurant, and various other events, was not that
I had forgotten them, but that they had never occurred. When I

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Amnesia associated with electrotherapy usually covers the period
immediately preceding and during the treatments, but I
have memory gaps concerning events which occurred months
afterward. This leads me to speculate that the drug overdoses I
took also affected my memory mechanism. After my experience
in the county hospital, I was worried about permanent brain
damage. Could this flickering instability of reality be a phenomenon
I would have to deal with for the rest of my life? But
those disorders of perception subsided, and it is possible that
events currently missing from my memory will one day be found,
also. Perhaps I have only lost the ability to recall them, the clue
as to where they are filed, and that may eventually be restored.


We talk a lot about having compassion for others—compassion
for the world's poor, the starving, the ugly. And that is relatively
easy. Our hearts go out to the orphan, the refugee, the bewildered
survivor of some horrible disaster. But turning that compassion
toward ourselves is another matter. We have trouble accepting
our own poverty, starvation, and ugliness. Somehow, it
is much easier to forgive the person who attempts suicide and
succeeds than the one who attempts it and fails.


My therapist once asked me what I wanted from him, and
when I had thought about it for some time, I said I wanted his
forgiveness. Actually, his forgiveness would not have resolved
anything; what I really needed was my own forgiveness. That
image of myself standing over the bathroom sink lifting and
lowering the razor blade haunted me like a scene from an insane
movie. I wanted to erase it, wipe it out, forget it, but I had to
remember it, pull it into my person, forgive it. We suffer our
harshest judgments from ourselves, and sometimes cannot live
with them.


My own self-judgment was black and unforgiving, a verdict
without appeal, but I have at last turned away from it. How did
that come about? Nothing in my external circumstances had

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had always had trouble with my name. What's your name?
was not an easy question to answer. The name I was born into
was strange and foreign; the other kids couldn't understand it,
and they laughed at it. My grandparents came to this country
with Lithuanian names, unspellable and unpronounceable. When
my paternal grandfather presented himself to the immigration
officials, his name baffled them, and rather than try to record it
correctly, they transliterated it into something that would have
been as strange and foreign in Lithuania as it was in the United
States. Therefore, my name did not even have the dignity of being
authentic. It was a bastard name, and I hated it.


My first husband's name was not much of an improvement.
It was a nice German-Jewish name, but it had too many syllables
and was unmusical in English. Because it was so obviously
Jewish, I was asked to use another name when I worked for the
Government of Pakistan.


Now I had three names: my maiden name, my married name,
and the name I used at work. After the divorce, I had a choice
of names, but I did not want any of those, so I took the name,
Mary Savage, which I have used for all my writing. My second
marriage added another name to the string, so that when someone

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But names are important; they identify us to the world, and
I think one of the reasons women have identity problems is that
they are required to take their husbands' names. Be that as it
may be, my lack of a permanent name troubled me. Recently, I
forgot to do some things I had promised to do, which upset me
because, although I don't always do what I have said I would,
it isn't because I forget about it. Then I dreamt I had forgotten
something really important, and when I asked myself what it
could be, the answer was: my name.


The series of names I used reflected my deep sense of personal
fragmentation. With one name, I was one person; with another
name, I was another person, but no solid connections linked
these various persons. Thus, I had to look at all of my names
and at the people they belonged to and incorporate them into
what I am now. I am that Lithuanian child, that Jewish wife,
that public relations person, that copywriter, that mother. I am
also that sick woman who had no name.


This process of integration, of assimilation, was inherent in
my psychotherapy. I had been in therapy for two years prior to
my rough landing in the county hospital. Watching my downward
spiral, my husband wondered what all this therapy was
doing besides enriching my therapist. But "all this therapy," including
my LSD experience, was like planting seeds in a garden.
You don't see them growing for a long time, and then suddenly
something sprouts. The discussions, the analyses, the insights
achieved at one level or another in my mind found their places
in the structure of my person.


Prior to my last suicide attempt, there had always been some
barrier to this process, preventing the lessons from being thoroughly
assimilated. Something shattered that barrier, or perhaps
it dissolved slowly and only seemed to be suddenly gone. Whatever
happened, it resulted in a deeper willingness to learn. But
why didn't it go the other way? When I found myself in the

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I don't really know, but I keep coming back to the fact that
this time I had committed myself to death as fully as I had ever
committed myself to anything, and it had not worked. Now I
had to commit myself to life, first as an act of desperation but
later as an act of love. Like a rat that finally stops banging its
head against a gate that never opens, I would stop committing
a suicide that never let me out. I would accept the fact that
whatever I was doing, I was not committing suicide. I would
learn to live not as an automaton or a collection of fragments but
as a whole person, more alive in every particle than I had ever
been.


When we talk about this, Dave says, "But you did it yourself."
And I agree. I did it myself. Without my decision to live,
I might very well be dead by now. But doing it myself is not the
same as doing it <i>by</i> myself. I could not have done it alone. I
needed a guide, a teacher, a therapist.


Since I was sixteen—or maybe it began when I was nine—I
had been tangling with recurring cycles of depression and despair.
At the hospital, I came to a crisis. Would that crisis and
its outcome have been possible without everything that had
preceded it? I have thought about this a lot, and my answer is,
"No." I had to go all the way down the road before I could
come back up. I had to explore the full measure of despair, including
the acts of suicide, before I could emerge from it. I had
to go the whole dark, destructive route, living it all the way to
the end and ultimately experiencing a kind of death, before I
could find the light again and fully realize myself. If that was
what was required to make me well, I could not have made it
all the way through without psychotherapy.


The journey nearly killed me, but now I am alive, wonderfully,
gratefully, reverentially alive. And I ask myself whether I

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Timing was essential—and mysterious. Why did the seed
sprout today and not yesterday? Consider the matter of my feelings
toward my mother, especially my anger which was so thoroughly
covered up that I did not know it was there. My therapist
urged me to discover this anger, to express it within the safe
boundaries of his office. But I would not. Prior to the last suicide
attempt, we were probing the question of my anger toward him,
which I denied.


"No," I said vehemently, "I'm not angry." I did not feel anger,
even though I could recognize intellectually that I was exhibiting
it. The admission of anger might lead to the admission of hatred.
I did not hate the therapist, and I did not hate my mother. My
mother had done nothing to elicit anything as strong as hatred.
She may not have been a very good mother, but she tried. She
may have made mistakes, but she was doing her best. After all,
I was now a mother and could understand her problems. No, I
wasn't angry. No, I didn't hate my mother. It was not possible.
It was not justified. Let's all please be rational about our mothers.


But I could hate myself, so I chopped up my wrist with a razor
blade and then decided to die. Yes, Mother, I really do hate you.
I hate you so much that I don't want to live any more.


One day, while working on this book, I was considering the
above circumstances. What did it all mean, really? I knew about
the anger, but only as an observer. Sometimes when you look up
at the sky, you see the clouds rushing along, shifting, changing,
tossing, and you conclude that, up there, the wind is blowing.

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I was thinking about this, all of a sudden the wind moved
down and hit me right in the chest. Anger. Anger billowed up
in me like a thundercloud. Mother, Mother, what did you do to
me? You took my feelings away from me. You stole them and
hid them so completely that I couldn't find them again. You
laughed at me for having feelings, so I began concealing them
from myself—concealing them, confusing them, mistrusting
them. They got all wound up into a weird kind of ball which
I could only carry around with me in a lump, to be produced
on occasion, usually inappropriately. Because they were so compressed,
they became intense and frightening.


I sat down and wrote a poem about it, addressed to my mother.
It contained a great deal of resentment, bitterness and hatred.
But I did not understand what was in the poem when I wrote
it. Perhaps I did not dare to understand it. I put the poem in my
handbag, and I tried to put the feelings in the handbag along
with it.


Several days later, I took the poem to my therapist. As he read
it, I was assailed by grief. Grief for my mother because she had
aroused these feelings in me. Grief because I knew she had not
meant to do what she had done to me, and I was sorry I had
found out about it. I grieved over her tragedy, and I grieved for
my own.


The therapist looked up. "Why do you find this so frightening?"
he asked. Frightening? I wasn't frightened, I was sad. "It
might get out of control," I whispered, remembering. He shook
his head. "Now that you know it's there, you can draw on it;
it's energy you can use." My anger and hatred had been dangerous
only as long as they were under pressure. Now they were
exposed and available.


But I still felt sad. Poor, tired, sick woman. She had not been
directly involved in my life for thirty years; why should I still
hate her so much? "Out of hatred comes sadness," my son had

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You loved her too," my therapist reminded me, "and the
opposite of love is not hate, but indifference." All my life I had
been striving for indifference, trying to suppress any emotion
only to have it pop out again where least expected. I could not
bear to love my mother, because I could not bear to find out that
I also hated her. Mother, Mother, Mother, you are still sitting on
my shoulder.


The therapist told me I would probably feel a great many
emotions about my mother because of this discovery and might
have strange fantasies about her, like the little boy who wrote
that he wanted to drive nails into his mother's eyes and throw
her in the garbage can. It was a Pandora's box, and I had lifted
the cover.


That night, my old fear of the dark temporarily returned. Why
should I be afraid? I thought. What was going on? It was several
days before I learned the reason for my fear. In the meantime,
I was subject to turbulent emotions, ranging from joy to grief,
love to sickness, fear to freedom. Regret and apology: I didn't
want it to be this way, Mom. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I wept because
when I tried to remember her as she was, I could not recall
anything good about her, no tenderness, no understanding, no
illumined photograph like the ones you see in magazines. There
were only scenes of criticism, ridicule, and hurt. But you loved
me, Mom. I know you did. Why can't I remember that?


At the same time, a part of me was waking up that had been
asleep for a long, long time. As I felt each of these emotions,
it became accessible to me in a new way. I could feel love and
joy and sadness and know that each feeling was valid, was
my own, was genuine. Newly awake, these emotions no longer
derived from my mother.


Fear threatened me from time to time. I knew now that my
anger would not become rage, but I was not sure whether or
not my fear might become panic. Out of control, fear is just as

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Nevertheless, I had to let go of her; there was nothing else
to do. In one of my dreams, my mother and I were at an airport
where I was trying to catch a plane. I was hampered by the
fact that she had both legs in casts, and I had to half-carry, half-drag
her up and down flights of stairs and along corridors to
the loading area. As long as she encumbered me, I would never
catch that plane.


In the end, I did not lose anything, I rearranged it. My mother
was still a part of me, but she was no longer in control of me.
I could acknowledge her, but I need not obey her. It was as if
a layer of ice around my heart had melted, making me at the
same time more vulnerable and more secure. So long, Mom, I
don't need you—as a point of reference—any more. From then
on, my experience of myself was a deeper, truer one, but the
only place I had dared to expose its beginnings was in the therapist's
office.


The process of psychotherapy is not usually so obvious. The
events described above happened fairly late in the proceedings,
and represent a culmination of many hours of hard work. I
could not achieve this insight earlier because I wasn't ready for
it, and as far as I know there are no shortcuts.


The poet Rilke once said he was afraid of psychotherapy because,
although it might dispose of his devils, it might also annihilate
his angels. For a long time, I halfway believed he was
right, but I don't think so any more. Psychotherapy reveals one's
devils, to be sure, but it does not necessarily require jettisoning

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As for angels, it is exciting to discover that they do, indeed,
exist, but it is not true that to be effective an angel must remain
anonymous. If one regards an angel as creative inspiration, as
Rilke must have, shining a little light on it will not destroy it.


Thus, when I write a poem or paint a picture, I am calling
upon both my angels and my devils to help me express something-whether
a humorous observation or a fresh insight or a
desire to tidy up leftovers. In the past, I threw much of my
writing away, but I realize now that in so doing, I was discarding
that part of myself from which it sprang, saying it was no
good and did not merit preservation. Today, my writing is the
primary way in which I speak my life—just as, for some women,
it is the house or the garden. In it, I pull together the various
roles I play throughout the day and bring them into perspective.


For a long time, I thought I really wasn't anything. If you
unwrapped me like an onion, as that first psychiatrist wanted to
do, you would not find anything at all, except perhaps a transient
smell—and not a particularly pleasant one. Now I know I
have a center. I am really here, and I can say so. My voice may
not be loud or strong, but it has its own significance. I am my
own meaning.


Thus, I have recovered from what seems, in retrospect, to have
been a lifelong illness. Not only have I come back from the
clinical depression I was suffering when I entered the county
hospital, but I have also made a deeper, more meaningful turning.
I have turned away from the darkness that was the backdrop
for my depression, the darkness that made my entire life
seem purposeless and incoherent. Not that the darkness no
longer exists; it is still there, but it is not the canvas on which
my life is painted.


This is the change, this deep and private turning, that has
made it possible for me to go on living. Not surviving, but living.

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I don't know exactly how this change came about. There were
many factors: psychotherapy, electrotherapy, pneumonia, biochemistry,
prolonged unconscious (which may have entailed a
death exerience), time. Combine all of these elements in the individual
who was lying on that bed in the county hospital, and
something happened, something which had not happened before
even when those same elements, as isolated events, were already
a part of my experience.


My theory is that timing was vital. Taken in context, one
event leads to another, making the outcome seem inevitable.
Given my previous history and my present circumstances, what
other result could there have been? Was my survival inevitable?
If I had died, my death would have seemed just as inevitable. If
I had lived but continued to attempt suicide, that would have
seemed inevitable, too. There might indeed be a "time to die,"
and mine has not yet arrived; if it had, my suicide would have
been a confirmation of it.


Whatever one's theory, I suffered a crisis of the soul while I
was in the county hospital. At some instant, probably while I
was still unconscious, everything came together with a force
that shattered something within me. My old way of looking at
life was destroyed just as surely as if I had actually died and
returned.


Thus it was that I was able to make a commitment to living
which I had been unable to make before. And thus it was, with
this commitment still in embryonic form, that I came to read
<i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i> during my last days in
the hospital. The book had been lent to me previously by a dear
friend who, on reading the first part of this manuscript, found
in it certain similarities to the intense experiences described by
James, especially the association between madness and religious
ecstasy. I did not read it when he first gave it to me, probably

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

From the age of six when my mother gave me my first book of
nursery rhymes, books have been important to me and have
influenced various turning points in my life. For example, reading
<i>The Second Sex</i> by Simone de Beauvoir contributed to my decision
to divorce my first husband. James' book had an equal
impact. Drawing his material from first-hand reports, he wrote
convincingly of how the force we sometimes call God had presented
itself to various people at various times, transforming
and strengthening them. No matter how strange the experience
seemed, they could not deny its reality. Although such enlightenments
can sometimes be subverted and misused, their original
direction is always positive: nobility of spirit, inner peace, unshakable
confidence.


Was it possible, I wondered, that something like that had
happened to me? There, in that midnight of my life, had I encountered
a force which is the source of being? Was that the
reason I was now able to see, where I had previously been blind?


The day after coming home from the hospital, I got up early
to send my son off to school. After he was gone, I knelt on the
floor, folded my hands and said, "Thank you. I am come home
unto myself." My eyes were closed, tears streamed down my
cheeks, I was shaking. Then I felt something—or someone—
touch my face, very gently, and with great warmth, affirmation
and welcome.


When I described the incident to my therapist, I said, "Far
out." "To whom?" he replied.


As a child, I was completely alienated from religion. Going to
church or Sunday school was the dullest thing anyone could
possibly do. I pictured God as an old man with a beard, wearing
a biblical robe and sitting at a huge desk, making notes in a
ledger on everyone's behavior, with appropriate comments as
to its "morality." I thought heaven must be a pretty terrible
place because no one ever slept there, and I could visualize myself
in heaven trying to stay awake and finally falling asleep and

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I was eighteen, I had a brief fling with the Roman Catholic
Church. All of my grandparents came from a Roman Catholic
country, and the women were devout churchgoers. (The men
were devout drunks.) Baptized "in the church" and often left
in the care of one of my grandmothers, I had been thoroughly
exposed to Catholicism while quite small. My parents, however,
acted religious only at Easter and Christmas. My father was uncomfortable
in church (as well as in a movie theatre) because he
suffered the fear of being in an enclosed space with a crowd of
people. Whatever religion he practiced had to be out in the
open and by himself. Mother believed that without some kind
of religion, one would be eternally damned. Both rebelled against
Catholicism, my father, at one point, professed to be a Christian
Scientist, and Mother wound up a Lutheran.


After my first sojourn in a mental hospital, I attended services
in a tiny chapel attached to a Roman Catholic college near our
home. I went to six-o'clock mass on Sunday mornings, walking
across dawn-damp meadows and feeling good about the Sundays
of my life. The service was entirely in Latin and there was no
sermon. I loved the beauty and serenity of the ritual, unlittered
by lectures on sin and damnation and hellfire. These services
were what religion should be: a matter of the heart. I had a sense
of quiet communion with something unidentified.


This seedling romance withered when I went to New York and
began reading philosophy and asking questions. I delved into
Episcopal beliefs, but it was an intellectual inquiry which never
bore fruit. One can very easily get bogged down in definitions
and never get beyond them.


Then there was my conversion to Judaism, which I justified
as a matter of necessity, but which was probably also an indication
that I wanted some kind of spiritual life. I loved the rabbi
who instructed me in Judaic principles, and I wanted to practice
Jewish ritual at home. My husband said I wanted to be more
Jewish than the Jews.

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For a number of years I worked for the Consulate General of
Pakistan in New York, where I became acquainted with the
teachings of Islam. I particularly admired the Pakistani Foreign
Minister, who came to New York for sessions of the U.N. General
Assembly. He was a devout Muslim, as well as a brilliant
debater, and I worked with him occasionally. He talked to me
about his religion and gave me books to read. But Muslims and
Jews are not happy partners, and I found it hard to equate the
principles of Islam with its expression in national policy.


At some point, I became too sophisticated to talk about God.
The word itself got in the way. I could talk about a "life force"
or a "unifying spirit" or a "supreme consciousness," but call any
of these things God, and Chunk! down came the gate. "I do not
believe in a personal God," I said, remembering that old man
frowning over his judgments. "Nor do I believe in personal survival
after death. When I die, that which I call ‘I’ vanishes completely."
In trying to commit suicide, I was trying to snuff out
the "I" whose presence in this world was far too painful.


But God was very much involved in my experience with LSD.
There was a presence in the room, over, above and around everyone
and everything that was visible. We were all aware of it,
but I felt it was something generated by my unconscious. Moreover,
I was annoyed because God was always represented as a
man,; when I looked at a painting of the crucifixion, I saw Christ
as a woman with a mustache, "a harlot," I said. One day, some
weeks afterward, I was sitting on the floor in our living room
listening to Verdi's "Requiem." The music filled me with light,
and I felt radiant and buoyant, uplifted and bathed in some sort
of incandescence. It seemed, then, that the hand of God reached
down to bless me, but I said, "No. Give that to my mother." My
mother was going into the hospital the next day for gall bladder
surgery.


Despite this perception of a spiritual presence, I continued to
regard God as an intellectual matter. It was interesting to speculate
about this presence, but it had no significance in my interior

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048380-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Deep down, however, I think I could not acknowledge God's
presence because I felt I was not worthy of that presence. I had
always felt I would not survive any kind of thorough self-scrutiny.
Psychotherapy frightened me because I was convinced it
would reveal an innate psychosis, a madness beyond redemption.
My experience with LSD didn't help, because of the difficulty I
had in reassembling myself afterward. Feeling that I had narrowly
escaped destruction by LSD, I feared that any further attempt
to explore my inner being might plunge me into the abyss.
Therefore, to say, "God, here I am," was to invite condemnation.
If God saw me, he would either laugh or look the other way,
for my central core was rottenness, beyond which there was
nothing.


My therapist had long urged me to explore religion, but no
formal religion could survive my critical appraisal. Meditation
was suggested, but again I was afraid that any inner search would
produce only goblins, whose presence I would not be able to
bear.


And so I talked and read and thought but did not move.


When I came home from the county hospital, I had to move.
Whatever the reason for my recovery, it was imperative that it
be reinforced. It might be merely a matter of biochemistry, but I
had to find some means of coping with the fear of a recurrence
of chemical imbalance even if lithium were to be used. I had
discovered that there was a spark in me, something that would
not let me die, and I wanted to foster it, help it grow. It had been

I looked around for a way to do this. Psychotherapy was helping
me to recognize and resolve my conflicts; painting was helping
me to relax and explore new perceptions; writing was helping
me to stabilize my identity. But the central spark of life required
nourishment of a different sort. Referring to James, it
seemed that a religious framework was needed, if I could find
one that was comfortable and did not offend my intellectual
criteria too violently.


I experimented with several religions, going to churches and
listening. In the end, I found I brought too much negative feeling
with me to truly listen to a Western religion. So I chose
an Eastern one which stresses meditation. There, with a teacher,
I learned to listen to another part of myself, and, through that
listening, make contact with the source of my own life-spark.
This source has been given many names, but the shortest and
most satisfactory is Om, or God.


I don't care how you define God. I think all definitions are
correct, and, at the same time, none is, for in the process of
formulating a definition, you confine something that is essentially
unconfinable. Also, any definition becomes a basis for argument.
The best description of God I have come across is the one
that says God is a circle whose circumference is nowhere but
whose center is everywhere.


Very early in my practice of meditation, I experienced the
cliché that God is love. It could also be called energy. It flowed
through me like a soft fire, a slow current that ignited everything
it touched, imbuing it with tremendous power which was
at the same time the epitome of peace. My first reaction was:
I am loved. I, even I, this formerly worthless, lost, lost thing.
And I knew that no life is meaningless, not even mine.


When I was going through the turbulence about my mother,
I found this limitless expanse of love every time I sat down to

This, then, is my insurance against dark days and bleak landscapes.
My life is no easier or more difficult than any other person's,
and the road I walk is occasionally full of potholes and
subject to flash floods. I do not get up singing every morning, and
there are times when my inner peace is pretty well fogged in.
There are days when I feel as tightly stretched as an inflated balloon,
and others when the balloon has been punctured.


But, for the first time in my life, there is the knowledge that
I have a center. My inner being, somehow or other, will suffice,
and that spark will continue to glow within me as long as my
life needs it. In my heart, I am glad I am alive, even on those
days when I don't understand what life is all about. Today, I
will learn something. It's all right if I forget to feed the cats.


Thus am I truly come home.
