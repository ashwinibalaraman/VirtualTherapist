I HEARD BUZZING, like the sound a fly makes hovering around
an electric light. Looking up from my bed toward the ceiling,
I saw a bright fluorescent light fixture and identified it
as the source of the droning, which intensified the terrible
ache in my head. The simple act of turning my face to the side
set off a series of sharp pains that shot through me from head
to toe. Tubes bandaged to my right hand climbed like ivy up
a metal pole from which hung three bags filled with fluid.


I had been taken from Harlem Valley to a small hospital in
a nearby Connecticut town, where I'd undergone surgery to
repair the severing of the anal sphincter, a result of the rape.
But what could be done to mend the sundering of my soul?
A man entered and identified himself as my surgeon. "I
know you're hurting," he said kindly. "See this gray button
that I'm placing in your hand? I want you to push it when
you need pain medication."

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Please don't make me ask for help, Doctor," I said.
Harlem Valley had assigned attendants to watch me around
the clock because I was still officially their responsibility: an
involuntary admission who'd been placed on suicide watch. I
gestured toward the pair, a man and a woman, who stood at
the door. "I don't want the attendants to know anything
about my pain," I said. I was concerned that they would go
back to Harlem Valley and tell my tormentors that they had
defeated me. I no longer trusted <i>anybody</i>.


The doctor seemed to understand. "Ring the buzzer three
times and I'll let the nurses know that's your call for pain
medication," he said, and left the room.


A television set was suspended from the ceiling to about
two feet above the bed. One of the attendants turned it on,
switching channels until she located her favorite soap opera.
Once again, the TV became a conduit for my voices. <i>You have
to get even, Kenny</i>, they sang in chorus. <i>You have to teach a
lesson to those pigs who called you a ho. They fucked you. Now
it's your turn. You have to fuck them back! ... Kenny needs to
hurt them</i> bad.


Never before had the voices instructed me to harm somebody
else. But there was something different about me now.
The voices zeroed in on the rage I was feeling. <i>We'll think up
some great ideas for how you can get back at them, Kenny ...
Leave it to us. We'll find a way for you to exact vengeance</i>.


I rang once for a nurse, who came quickly. "Please, can I
speak to you in private?" I whispered.


She asked the attendants to step outside for a moment
(they left grudgingly), then pulled the curtain around us. I
told her I heard voices and that they grew louder and more
intense whenever the television or radio was on. She immediately

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The attendants weren't happy with this. "Why'd you take
our TV away, punk?" they complained. "Hell, we've got to
spend eight hours each shift watching you lie in bed. You
think you're that interesting, Steele? You think the world
revolves around you now? Well, it don't."


My voices spoke for me. <i>Fuck you. We'll get back at you
later, assholes</i>. I closed my eyes and lay still.


There was only one person I needed to speak to, and
quickly. That was Anthony. At my request, a nurse brought
in a telephone the following afternoon and placed a call to
Manhattan State Hospital, where, by prearrangement,
Anthony waited at the pay phone. "Don't come up to Harlem
Valley under any circumstances," I warned him. "It's very
dangerous and a hundred times worse than Manhattan
State." I must have said <i>very dangerous</i> at least ten times during
the three minutes we spoke. I didn't tell Anthony what
had happened to me but felt grateful that, at the very least,
I'd protected him from a similar assault.


My three-week stay in the hospital went by too quickly,
for here people treated me kindly, bringing me medicine and
books--both of which dulled the physical pain and mental
anguish I continued to suffer. I wished I could have stayed
on forever, but that wasn't possible. Instead, I was returned
to Harlem Valley, continuing a schizophrenic odyssey that
would find me cycling in and out of hospitals and halfway
houses from Maine to Hawaii and points in between. Caught
up in the revolving door of the mental health system, I'd go
round and round, without really getting anywhere at all.

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This time at Harlem Valley, I was assigned to the infirmary,
a locked facility that mainly housed a geriatric population. I
lay in a hospital-style bed, which was placed in the hallway
where I could be observed by the staff. Several of the older
residents thought I was their son or grandson. Two women
said I was their father. Another believed I was her husband
and scolded me for spending too little time with her.


For the most part, these old people sat in the dayroom
and stared without looking at a television set that was kept
on morning and night. I wondered if, like me, they heard
voices coming from it. Once my health improved and I was
able to get about, although with difficulty, I read to the old
folks from a mystery novel I'd found on one of the tables.
Some of the men and women were able to follow the story
and looked forward to hearing the next chapter; others, less
focused, simply enjoyed the attention of being read to. One
April day, I happened upon a newspaper that must have been
left on the unit by a staff member or visitor. It was about two
weeks old. Martin Luther King had been murdered while I
lay in the hospital! In some indefinable way, I knew I'd had a
hand in his death.


Another sunny afternoon, a nurse approached me as I sat
reading in my wheelchair. She asked if I wished to receive
Communion. "No," I answered automatically. <i>No Communion
for you, Kenny</i>, was the instruction I heard. Later, however, I
noticed the priest on the ward. He was a sturdily built man,
in his fifties I guessed, and he looked to be gentle. He seemed
really to listen to the old people; he didn't just pat them on
the shoulder before moving on. I wheeled my chair over to
the nurses' station. "Can I speak with the father?" I asked
the nurse on duty.

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I don't recall what Father Luke and I talked about during
that first visit and subsequent ones, but I came to look forward
to our chats. Eventually, I grew comfortable enough to
dare ask if he would hear my confession. He consented. As
we sat together in a shaded vestibule off the dayroom, my
life story tumbled out of me in a disjointed, epic confession. I
told Father Luke about my voices and that I had been doing
their will when I attempted the unforgivable act of suicide
by trying to jump from a tall building. I confessed my feelings
of hatred for the attendants at Harlem Valley and for any
others whose heinous acts were responsible for sending me
here. I spoke of how frightened I was of my new lust for
vengeance. It brought dark clouds into my mind, clouds that
remained even when the voices paused in spewing their
venom. I confessed to the sin of prostitution. I even provided
the father with details of the rape--something I had not
been able to think about before, let alone put into words.


When it was over, I sat looking down at the floor.


The good father absolved me of my sins. "God has forgiven
you," he said. "Now you must work on forgiving yourself."
Leaving a prayer book with me, he asked me to read
from it every day. My tears fell on its white leather covering.


At his next visit, Father Luke told me I would not be
returning to my ward at Harlem Valley. I felt great relief at
the news. And, he said, once I was well enough to leave the
infirmary, I could be transferred back to Manhattan State if I
wished. If I wished! We began the paperwork for my transfer
immediately.


A month later, right about the time that Robert Kennedy
was killed (my fault again), I was readmitted to the Dunlap
building at Manhattan State, this time as a voluntary patient.

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It took a while for me to become a candidate for discharge.
"It's important that you demonstrate a consistent
pattern of good behavior and that the doctors are comfortable
that your medication is working before we can consider
it," explained my new social worker, Mr. Marks. The truth
is, I was tonguing whatever pills were meted out to me. I
couldn't take a chance on suffering the medicine's side
effects: akathisia, blurry vision, stomach aches, nausea. I
chose instead to deal with my voices, which had left off
directing me to hurt others and returned to instructing me
on ways to effect my own demise.


Life on the ward fell into a manageable routine. Mornings
began with Community Meeting, where announcements
were made about changes in privileges or discharge plans.
Fridays, we'd find out whether our requests for a weekend
pass were granted. Anthony and I had asked for a day pass,
during the weekend, so we could go into the city and see the
latest James Bond movie. Request denied.


Other ward activities included group therapy sessions
(though therapy for whom, I could not tell you). The gatherings
were typical of what passed for help at many state institutions
for the mentally ill. Ten or twelve of us would sit
around in a semicircle, facing a staff member who served as
group leader. We patients were supposed to talk about things
that were on our minds. One man insisted that he, not Lyndon
Johnson, was the president and that he'd been locked
away here by conspirators. Another talked about the relative

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"And you, Steele?" she said, turning to me one morning.
Her voice came at me from the outer rim, for I had not been
taking my medication and was lost in the din of my hallucinatory
voices.


I started, like a schoolboy caught not paying attention.
"Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies," I replied. Without
comment, she moved on to the next person in the circle.


Soon Anthony was discharged to the care of his family. "If
you had a family that would take you back, your chances for
discharge would be far better," Mr. Marks told me after
Anthony and I had said good-bye. "But that's not possible,"
he went on, shrugging his shoulders. "Your parents have a
young child and feel that they can't take any chances." He
brightened. "They recently sent you some money, though--
the rest of the insurance money, they said to tell you. You can
put it in savings or use it to cover expenses here."


My body went numb. My father and mother had been in
communication with people at the hospital, had told them
about my baby brother, had even sent money, but they had
never visited, had not even phoned me. If my parents had
stayed by my side from early on, if they'd supported me, who
knows what a different course my illness might have taken. I
wish someone in authority had given them the advice I now
offer to parents of young people with mental illness--
parents who are concerned because their sons and daughters

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Luckily, my friend Anthony had his parents. And I? I had
a check.


I tried to maintain my composure in front of Mr. Marks,
but my voices were having a field day with his news. <i>Told
you this would happen, Kenny, didn't we?</i> they screamed at me.
<i>The baby himself told you, way back when he was in your
mother's stomach</i>.


"Look at me," Mr. Marks said as he gently put a hand to
my chin and lifted it. My face was covered with tears. "This
is progress," he said softly, handing me a tissue. "Anyone
would cry given what I just told you. And then, with
Anthony leaving, you must feel very sad. But look how well
you are managing these events. This is what we mean by
showing appropriate behavior and maintaining your impulse
control. I am very encouraged by this." Because I characteristically
showed little expression and the voices disordered my
thoughts and feelings, Mr. Marks believed I was behaving
well in appropriately expressing grief. I didn't tell him what
the voices were saying ... or that I hadn't taken my medication
for a very long time.


I began to think more and more about suicide, even beyond
the insistent commands of my voices. I wondered what kind
of life lay before me. My one real friend was gone; I'd been

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The voices were all I had. They urged me to escape.


<i>Take the bus ... the same bus that carried you from the
island the last time. You can go to New York, and from there
you can find a forest. A forest of thick trees where you can
hide.... We'll guide you, we'll guide you, well guide you the
rest of the way</i>.


At times, I saw the voices--or at least I think I saw them.
Hallucination or imagination? I don't know, but the vision
was real . . . and horrifying. The Ruler, whose identity had
been provided by my grandmother, was the devil--not
Satan with a red face and horns, but a larger-than-life wolf-creature
that stood erect on two legs. The ubiquitous other
voices, those lesser demons, were a pack of dogs, yet they
were also human. Wolf, dogs, people--all came bearing
down on me.


Acting on their instructions, I went to the administration
building and withdrew twenty-five dollars from my account,
leaving behind the balance of the money sent by my parents.
I didn't want their money. Then I boarded a bus to Manhattan.
Once there, I walked and walked aimlessly, grateful to
find a park bench where I could rest every once in a while.
Drawn to grass and trees, I walked toward Riverside Drive
and the Henry Hudson Parkway, where I held out my thumb
and caught a ride with a man who told me he was heading to
Massachusetts. I said I was going that way, too.


Four hours later, he dropped me off somewhere in Boston.
Again I walked, remembering places like the Old North
Church and Paul Revere House that I'd read about in histories

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In my wandering, I found my way to the South End and
its several missions with soup kitchens, where volunteers
generously ladled out meals to the hapless and homeless. The
food was no worse, and sometimes better, than what I'd been
served in state hospitals. I foraged through bins behind
restaurants, grateful for scraps that others threw away.


Voices dogged my every step. <i>Look at you, Kenny. You're
really a mess.... Look at your hair ... it's matted, like a dog
that's just come out of the water.... When was the last time
you washed? You stink, Kenny. Phew. Nobody wants to get anywhere
near you</i>. The voices were right. People made room for
me when I passed by. Catching a glimpse of myself in a store
mirror, I was shocked by my changed appearance. In my
early twenties, I looked old and weathered. I <i>felt</i> old. My
skin had turned dark and leathery, a result of constant exposure
to the elements. My hair was long and unkempt. My
clothing, soiled and rumpled, hung loose on my gaunt frame.
If <i>I'd</i> seen me coming, I would have crossed the street.


I must have been acting strange, too, for I was picked up
by the police one day and taken to Metropolitan State Hospital
in Waltham, Massachusetts. The hospital, which closed in
1992, was made up of several brick buildings that housed
about 500 patients. As usual, I was admitted as an involuntary

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Take it," she commanded, handing me my medication. I
did as I was told.


Haldol, the drug she'd ordered me to take, brought on the
most frightening side effects I'd yet experienced. The symptoms
were similar to those in Parkinson's disease. By blocking
the nerves that control relatively gross motor movements,
Haldol made me feel like the Tin Man from the <i>Wizard of Oz</i>,
without any oiling. I moved stiffly and with extreme slowness.
My jaw was rigid, and I actually was afraid that I
would swallow my own, swollen tongue. No, not just afraid,
but terrified. <i>They're strangling you</i>, said my voices gleefully.
<i>Strangling you with your own tongue. That ought to put an end
to this farce of a life</i>.


It seemed an eternity before a doctor came to see me. He
gave me a shot (probably Cogentin), then casually poured
himself a cup of coffee at the nurses' station and sat reading a
paper while I stood transfixed, uncertain of what to do and
sure that I was about to die. Eventually, someone helped me
to a bed, where, in time, the stiffness and panic subsided.


Though I had no visitors, I was by no means alone. In the
wards and hallways of the institution, I felt the presence of
souls who preceded me here. The first of these ghosts to
speak to me was a young woman. "You remind me of my
Sean," I heard one day. The voice was soft and playful.


"Who are you?" I asked. I did not see her; I never saw
any of the ghosts whose voices I heard.


"I'm Leslie," she said. "You have the same attitude as my
Sean." I didn't understand what she meant by <i>attitude</i>, but
from the way she said it, I sensed it was something positive.

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later, Sean approached and told me their story. "Leslie
had just come from Europe with her family," he said. (That
explained the hint of a foreign accent in her speech.) "She
became ill, and her parents didn't know how to care for her.
They put her in this hospital, where we met and fell in love."
Sean and Leslie would frequently visit me during my two
years at Metropolitan. Sometimes, Leslie would confide in
me. Then Sean would get mad at her for telling me things he
didn't want me to know. Theirs was an ongoing love story.


Another recurrent visitor was an old seafarer, a retired
captain of a high-masted schooner, who had been in the slave
trade when it was legal, had then gone loony, and had ended
up in the hospital. The captain told me about sailing around
the Horn of Africa, visiting Madagascar and other ports of
call. His stories were those of adventure.


The voices of the storytellers were not threatening. They
never ordered me to hurt myself, never yelled or screamed.
Like the characters I met in books, they provided respite
from the evil voices--perhaps because their narratives had
nothing to do with me and I could lose myself in the imaginary
worlds that they painted for me. Over the years, they
would reappear in my life at different times and in various
places. Unlike the evil voices, they were always welcome.


I gained ground privileges quickly and soon was assigned
to an on-site workshop where I even earned a few dollars a
week doing assembly-line work on industrial products--
much as I might have done had I stayed at home and gone to
work at Timex or another local factory. The monotony of the
work suited me (perhaps it's in the genes, I thought), as did
the fact that conversation with coworkers was not encouraged
here. I wanted no more friendships so that I'd never

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The doctors grew concerned about my depressive state.
"We can try giving him antidepressant medicines, and if
they don't work, we can go to shock treatments," they said in
front of me, the invisible man. Oh, but I could hear ... and
so could my voices.


<i>Shock treatments, Kenny.... Electric volts going through
your brain and leaving you senseless. How does that sound to
you? ... You should have electrocuted yourself in the shower the
way we told you to, long, long ago. Now somebody else is going
to have to do the job.... You're really in for it now</i>.


Try as I might, I could not make the necessary changes in
behavior, could not perk up or become more affable, as the
doctors wished. But if I did not change, I knew, they would
only put me on new and different medications. And if those
medicines failed to lift my spirits? The phrase <i>shock treatments</i>
reverberated through my addled brain. I had seen
patients after they'd been given electroconvulsive therapy
(ECT). They looked like zombies, and some of those I knew
had lost their memories. Though they and I had spoken
before, after treatment they no longer remembered me.


There was only one way I knew to avoid this dreaded
fate: leave the hospital. And so, one winter morning, I did
just that. Dressed in fresh clothes, good shoes, and a warm
winter coat chosen from the secondhand bin, I left the main
building, walked past the workshop, quit the hospital
grounds, and just kept going.

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wasn't gone more than a week when the voices ordered
me to take some rope that I'd found along the road, tie a
noose, and hang myself from a tree. <i>What are you waiting
for?</i> they asked after I'd located an accessible, hefty tree limb
and managed to toss the rope over, then secure it. What
indeed? <i>Get up there and stick your neck in the noose</i>.


Several times I tried to follow their commands, but I
couldn't get the noose to support my six-foot, 170-pound
body. The last attempt ended when I fell, banged my head on
a stone, and wound up in a medical hospital.


What's your name?" I saw a blurred form and tried to make
the speaker out. White uniform, peaked white cap. Oh, a
nurse.


"You didn't have any identification on you, so we can't
notify your family that you're here," she explained. "You
took a fall and have a concussion. Some kids found you and
summoned a police officer, who had you brought here." She
nodded toward the door, and I noticed the officer. Again she
asked, "Can you tell me your name?"


I lay there and said nothing. Nor did I respond to the doctor
who next entered or to the psychiatrist who'd been called
in on a consult. I was too sedated to speak. I also was tired--
tired of hospitals, doctors, nurses, aides, social workers, security
officers, kitchen staff. I was tired of talking, and so I
remained mute.


"Well, son, your fingerprints drew a blank," said the psychiatrist
after several visits during which I'd continued to
hold my tongue. "Apparently, you're not wanted for anything,
and you don't fit the description of anyone who's been

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My silence bought a ride to Westboro, about forty miles
west of Boston, where I was admitted as a "John Doe" and
assigned to yet another locked and violent ward. Although I
still spoke to no one (leading one doctor to describe me as
<i>catatonic</i>), I growled. I now carried myself in a way that said
clearly: DON'T MESS WITH ME. It mattered little to me what hospital
or ward I was in, they were all part of the same system.
And so was I. In my early twenties, I had become an institutionalized
man.


I even had a new name. "Shannon Steele," I said to one of
the attendants at Westboro about two weeks after I arrived.
"That's my name." For one thing, I was worried that if people
knew my real name, they'd soon learn that I'd eloped from
Metropolitan; for another, I no longer wanted to be Kenny
Steele. Thereafter, I used K. Shannon Steele as my official
name and asked people to call me Shannon.


My life story would soon undergo further revision.
Asked for the umpteenth time how and where the hospital
could contact my family, I was amazed one day to hear
myself reply, "My parents died in an airplane crash. I've
been on my own since the age of eighteen." My voices had
said often enough that I was dead to my parents; now they
would be dead to me.


The voices would not let me get away with this. <i>You
meant to say that you're the one who's going to die, didn't you,
Kenny? Your family is alive ... alive and thriving, as you well</i>

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now where in Ireland did your people come from?" Patricia
McCarthy, R.N., asked me. A slim woman who stood several
inches below me, Nurse McCarthy had curly auburn hair,
hazel eyes, an Ivory soap complexion that you could almost
smell, and a smile that would brighten any room she
entered. She looked to be in her early thirties--older than I
was but not old enough to be my mother.


"What makes you think they came from Ireland?" I
asked.


"And why else would they have named you Shannon?"
she answered.


I smiled. I couldn't believe it--I actually smiled back in
response.


"So you think I'm funny, do you?" she said.


I not only thought Nurse McCarthy funny, I thought she
was the loveliest woman I had ever seen. And the nicest. I
found myself looking forward to the times when she would
be on duty, so we could talk. She never pried into my life,
and so I felt free to share bits and pieces of it with her, like
two friends having a conversation. As I opened up to her, I
became more relaxed with others as well. Nurse McCarthy
noticed the change. "One of these days, Shannon my lad, you
may even be able to transfer from here to a halfway house on
the grounds," she told me one day.


Halfway house? The Westboro campus, she explained,
was made up of large buildings, like the one I was in, and
smaller group homes--halfway houses--where patients

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The halfway house I entered was a sprawling place with
many bedrooms, a large kitchen and dining area, and a common
room. I shared a bedroom with Wally, a nice enough
guy who had an off-grounds job at a gas station and was
learning to be a mechanic. In the beginning, at least, I was
still expected to return to the main building each day for my
medication and to meet with my doctor and nurse. In due
course, I would pick up a month's supply of meds at the hospital
and be responsible for my own compliance.


Each resident also had an in-house task; mine was to
assist a fellow patient, Shirley, who prepared the group's
meals. It didn't take long for me to realize that Shirley couldn't
cook--not only that, but her sanitary habits left a lot to
be desired. I paled as I watched her sink her dirty hands and
filthy fingernails into the chopped meat, twisting and
pounding it into a loaf. When I spoke to her about it, she
said, "But look how clean my nails come out." Suffice it to
say that I, who had survived on trash-can scraps, would not
eat any food that Shirley had handled.


When I raised the matter at a house meeting, all the residents
(but Shirley) agreed that something needed to be done,
and they elected me cook. Since I'd been the one who'd complained,
I felt that I had to rise to the challenge. I spent most of

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The outside job I coveted was that of an orderly. I'd
enjoyed being with the older people during my stay in the
infirmary following the rape and hospitalization and thought
that I could not only manage that job, but also make a difference.
Nurse McCarthy brought me books on how to handle a
job interview (dress neatly, arrive promptly, sit up straight,
and look directly at the interviewer). She spoke about something
called a <i>résumé</i> and helped me prepare one, suggesting
that I start by writing my current position, head cook at the
halfway house, at the top. She also had me list my volunteer
work with the elderly at Harlem Valley State Hospital, as
well as my job at Fairchild Publications. I wrote that I had a
high school diploma. Nurse McCarthy didn't know that was
false. My voices did, and they called me a liar. <i>You will fail,
just as you did at Fairchild</i>, they said. But the halfway house
residents and Nurse McCarthy were giving me a different
message. They told me I could do it, and so I was able to set
aside the taunts of the evil voices. I felt hopeful and ready.


Any request to seek work outside the house had to be
made to the residents. Three months passed before my doctor
would allow me to raise the issue at a house meeting. I
received the group's unanimous approval. Even Shirley voted
in my favor. Now it was up to me to find the job. I wrote to a
nursing home in the area and was given an appointment for
an interview. The responsibility for getting there and back
was mine as well. On the scheduled day, I hitchhiked the
four miles to the facility, arriving early. "Miss Benton, the

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Miss Benton didn't keep me waiting. "So you're Mr.
Steele," she said, indicating a chair before her desk.


"Yes, ma'am," I said, smiling broadly and maintaining eye
contact as I took my seat. In answer to her questions, I spoke
of my genuine feeling for the elderly and gave examples of
how I had interacted with the people in the infirmary.


"Do you think you could handle bathing men who are
incontinent?" she asked.


I wasn't sure what her question meant. "Miss Benton, I
think <i>incontinent</i> means that the men lose control of their
bladder or bowels, is that right?" I asked.


"Very good," she said, smiling broadly. I told her I could
manage that and, in answer to other questions posed to me,
said that I would work "any" shifts--double shifts, back-to-back,
graveyard. The decisions were mine to make; I just had
to phone "home" if I planned to work late. That's what I
liked about the halfway house. They treated the residents
like grown-ups.


"Okay, I'll get in touch with Mrs. Peele, the nurse who
requested an orderly," Miss Benton said. "She should be calling
you in a day or two to schedule a second interview."
Miss Benton wished me good luck and handed me some
papers describing the work rules and benefits at the nursing
home.


Five very long days passed before I received a call from
Mrs. Peele. I arrived for our meeting with high hopes and a

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I opened the door to the halfway house slowly. "Congratulations,"
everyone called at the top of their lungs. Nurse
McCarthy was there, her warm smile enveloping me.


"Stop!" I shouted above the din. "You're all wonderful,
but I didn't get the job. I was too inexperienced."


"Yes, you did," said Nurse McCarthy. "Miss Benton
phoned here and left you a message: You start work tomorrow ...
as a cook!"


I returned Miss Benton's call. She confirmed my employment,
and added that she also had signed me up for a basic
nurse's aide course where, among other things, I'd be taught
to take blood pressure, perform CPR (cardiopulmonary
resuscitation), and do the Heimlich maneuver--in case people
choked on their food.


Now we could celebrate. As I cut the cake that my
halfway house friends had prepared for me, Nurse McCarthy
asked if she could have the honor of cutting the second
piece. "I have good news, too," she told us. "I'm expecting a
baby." I looked at her. How could I not have seen? But the
voices kept me so self-centered that I often failed to notice
important things happening to the people around me. I felt
happy for her, happy for me, genuinely, generally happy.


I was now on Trilafon, the first antipsychotic medication
that didn't give me horrible side effects. (Like so many mentally
ill patients, I became my own doctor, adjusting the
doses of my medications; in this case, I took half the measurement

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Still, it was the stable periods, times when I was most productive,
that built my self-esteem and helped balance the
down times. And so it is with so many of us who struggle
with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. That's one of
the reasons I feel so strongly about the need to be given
meaningful work instead of the make-busy tasks or rote
assignments that make up the bulk of what we are offered. If
people are treated as capable, they often surprise everyone
and live up to expectations.


I had been working in the kitchen at the nursing home
for two weeks, preparing food and helping to feed patients,
when I was called to the office of Mrs. Adams, the director of
nurses. She told me that people had been pleased with my
work and that the staff had especially noted my success in
feeding the most difficult patients. Henceforward, I would
work one shift in the kitchen, another as an orderly, reporting
to Mrs. Peele. Was that okay with me?


The job of orderly suited me. I liked the routine--bathing
and dressing "my men," cleaning and making their beds. As I
worked, I would tell them stories I had read in books and listen
to the tales they would tell about their own lives. When

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One evening, I returned from work to find a message to
phone Nurse McCarthy's ward. The news was bad, said the
person who took my call. "Nurse McCarthy was attacked by
a new admission," she told me, "and the baby was born prematurely.
Both mother and child are hospitalized and in critical
condition. We thought you would want to know." I
sobbed, certain that my demons had caused this, too.


Days turned to weeks as I waited for word of my friend's
condition. I threw myself into my work, filling in for any
employee who called in sick, just so I wouldn't have to think.
At long last, Miss Benton called me to her office. "We've had
news," she said. "Fortunately, Nurse McCarthy will recover.
The bad news is that the baby lived only three weeks."


The voices rained down upon me from all sides. <i>If it
weren't for you, Nurse McCarthy would never have lost her baby</i>.


<i>She was thinking of taking time off for the pregnancy, but
then you came along. She stayed because of you ... because you
kept her here</i>.

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>It was another boy, you know</i>.


<i>How many more people will you hurt? You must die so that
others can live. When are you finally going to do our bidding?
Suicide's the only answer</i>.


It was one of the worst psychotic storms of my life. I was
bombarded by the voices and overcome by self-loathing.
Here I'd been trying so hard to achieve some kind of useful
life, but every attempt resulted in disaster and I was back
where I started: damned. I <i>had</i> to be damned to hell, just as
my grandmother had prophesied when I told her about my
voices. Damned to wander the world a loner. I returned to
the halfway house, packed what few things I could carry,
pocketed my small savings, and once more started walking. It
was the only way I knew to handle a problem--flee from it.
On the road, I slept mostly in public toilets along interstate
highways, where I was often forced to fight off the
predators who rob and assault the homeless mentally ill.
Autumn was turning to winter. I began to hitchhike again,
this time catching a ride with a man driving a large tractor-trailer
to Chicago. A redheaded guy whose worn jeans were
held in place by wide suspenders over a plaid flannel shirt,
the driver told me that there would be a price for the ride. In
return for "certain sexual favors"--that's how he put it--he
would provide safe passage, plus food and drink. I didn't
have to ask what he meant: Ted and Nick had taught me well.


I hoisted myself up to the cab, and we were off. Along the
way, "Red" introduced me to vodka, and I soon discovered
the numbing relief that alcohol could bring to a mind searching
for forgetfulness. He kept the radio on much of the time,
and the vodka helped dull the voices that emanated from
it--voices that now had even more to rail about.

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At last we reached Chicago. Gusts blew across Lake
Michigan into a city that struck me as more intimidating
than Boston but less inviting than New York. Shivering, I
pulled the collar of my jacket up and looked about me, wondering
in which direction to head. I felt fearfully alone and
vulnerable.


"I know places you can stay, boy, and people who will put
you up for a while if you do with them what you did with
me," Red said. "I've got friends clear across this country."


<i>There you go again, Kenny. Once a ho, always a ho. Is this
what you're struggling to live for?</i> No, I told the voices, but I
was struggling to live, and satisfying men's desires was
preferable to selling drugs or committing robberies--two
other opportunities that had been offered me during my
wanderings and that I'd rejected. I told Red I'd be grateful
for his assistance.


He paid for a room at the kind of motel that charges by
the hour and, to my delight, allowed me to enjoy a night's
sleep. The next morning, Red took me to a barbershop,
where a man cut my hair short and a lady soaked and clipped
my fingernails. Then we were off to a clothing store, where I
was outfitted with slacks, sports coats, shoes--"the latest
duds," Red called them. I would be "Cinderfella" for a night
or two, he told me, until he found me a prince.


That night we went to a gay nightclub named the
Napoleon Club, probably because of all the short, portly,
balding men who seemed to be its principal patrons. There
were also tall young men like myself whose attire ranged
from formal to casual: From the look of us, we could have
been college students or executive trainees--young men
who had yet to make their mark on life. But I was marked. It

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We sat together for a long time; mostly, Karl talked and I
listened. He told me that he'd attended college and business
school, both at Harvard, and had worked in his father's business
until recently. He said that his family owned a home in
Wheaton, Illinois, but that he lived in an apartment in the
city. Finally, he invited me to go home with him--not just for
the night, but to move in with him; if we got along, he said,
he would take care of me.


I said I had to speak to Red. At the start of the long drive
from Massachusetts to Chicago, I'd told Red about having
been raped, making clear to him that there were strict limits
to what I would do and, more importantly, what I would not
allow to be done to me in a sexual relationship. Red had
respected those boundaries. Now I asked him to make them
clear to Karl. The two men spoke briefly, then Red wished me
well. "You don't have to pay me back for the duds, kid," were
his parting words to me. "Everything's been taken care of."


And so I moved into Karl's apartment on one of the upper
floors of a high-rise on Lake Shore Drive. It had wraparound
windows, furniture of polished wood, deep beige carpets, and
glass tables that gleamed beneath the indirect lighting. There
was a working fireplace in the living room. Karl showed me to
my bedroom; it was larger than the entire first floor of my
childhood home, and it came with a private bathroom. But it

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Look at the buildings, the tall, tall buildings, they ordered
in chorus. Smart, Kenny. Really smart to get this fag to take
you to one of the tallest ones. ... Look at the terrace, Kenny.
You don't have to climb to the top of a very tall building. You're
already here. See how easy it will be? You can just step out
onto that terrace and make the leap you should have taken
long ago. ... This is where you will end your life, in Chicago,
the Windy City. ... Jump! We'll watch the wind carry you
away</i>.


Karl could not fail to see the look of horror on my face. He
handed me a drink. I gulped it down, felt a burning in my
throat, and asked for another. Three drinks succeeded in
making the voices recede ... like the ebbing of a wave that,
moments before, had arrived in full force, roaring and crashing
its way toward the shore.


Karl had more than three drinks--not just that night, but
every night. He used to joke that most of his friends were
over twenty years old, and in time he introduced me to some
of them: Jack Daniel, Johnny Walker, and Jim Beam. They
helped him forget, he said. I wondered briefly if he, too,
might be schizophrenic, but I soon discovered that his
demons were of a different nature.


What plagued Karl was the devastating loss of his mother
and father, who were killed in a car crash when rounding a
notoriously dangerous S curve on Lake Shore Drive, less than
a mile from his place. An only son, Karl had inherited the
family business, for which he'd been groomed from day one.

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Karl can't stand being alone," a patron at one of the
places that we frequented told me one evening, adding, "He's
constantly picking up young guys, letting them stay with
him, and getting ripped off. One even threatened him with a
weapon."


That explained a lot of things--for example, the fact that
Karl yearned for companionship more than he wanted sex.
But he liked to pretend to others that we were ardent lovers,
and I went along with the ruse. He was a good and generous
companion, and I came to care for him deeply.


One day, Karl told me that he had to make a business trip
to Denver and asked if I wanted to come along. Sure, I said.
This would be my first flight--and we were going first-class,
no less. My voices came along for the ride. <i>So you think the
clouds are beautiful, do you? they said. Well, take a good look
at them, because this is as close to heaven as you will ever get</i>.
The stewardess offered me another drink. "Yes, thank you," I
said, and took two small bottles of whiskey, which I downed
quickly.


The city of Denver lies on a kind of plain that looks out at
the Rocky Mountains--a sight so awesome to this boy from
the East, I thought at first it must be a hallucination. Karl
had booked us a room at the elegant Brown Palace Hotel,
which gleamed of onyx and marble. We stayed for three
days, spending most of the time at a bar named The Court
Jester, a popular spot where Karl was known. His drinking

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later that afternoon, I returned to the hotel expecting to
freshen up and head out, with Karl, for the evening. "Sorry,"
said the desk clerk when I requested the key to our room.
Karl had checked out. "Your luggage has been stored with
us," said the clerk. "Do you want to retrieve it now?"


Did I want... what? I asked the clerk to check again, but
he told me that there was no mistake. He'd been on duty
when Karl had paid the bill and gone. Not once, but at least a
half dozen times, I phoned Karl's number in Chicago. No one
answered. I pondered my next move. Should I return to
Chicago and head back to the apartment? I wanted the life I'd
been leading. I wanted Karl.


<i>Sure he left you</i>, said the voices. <i>You were just a fling. Who
could care about you?</i> They began laughing hysterically. I
needed to quiet them so I could plan my next move. "Will
you hold my luggage for a few days?" I asked the desk clerk.


"There are lockers at the Greyhound bus terminal," he
answered.


I lugged my suitcases from the hotel to the terminal, a distance
of about half a mile, and located the lockers. As I
stowed my stuff inside, a younger Ken flashed before my
eyes--a teenager who had placed his trunk for overnight
safekeeping in Grand Central Station. I remembered the

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As the drink took effect, I sank into a deeper and deeper
depression. Now, even <i>without</i> the voices nudging me on,
suicide became a serious option, a way out of the sorrow and
the sordidness. I felt it as a heavy weight, dragging me down
to the depths where demons reside. I did not want to be
picked up by anyone at the bar that night. I had no stomach
for it. I left, searching for a secluded spot to rest. The voices
came back as the alcohol wore off, their message (as always) a
relentless mix of disdain and despotism--ordering me to do
away with myself.


Then I did the most extraordinary thing. <i>On my own</i>, I
went to the emergency room of a hospital--no ambulance,
police, or drama of any kind brought me there--and told the
receptionist that I needed to see a doctor. She asked what
was wrong. "I'm feeling depressed," I said. She asked if I had
insurance, and I replied that I didn't. She handed me a form
and asked me to fill it out. Then I waited.


Eventually, a nurse called my name and showed me to an
office, where she took my temperature, blood pressure, and

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You know," she said, having smelled my breath, "alcohol
is a depressant." I simply stared at her. How could I make her
understand the seriousness of my situation? "Do you have
suicidal ideation?" she asked me.


"I don't know what that means," I told her, "but I have
voices telling me to jump off buildings and to cut my throat."
She made me promise not to leave the office while she
arranged for a doctor to see me. Then she left, briefly, saying,
"A resident will be here soon. Meanwhile, there's some medicine
that can help you with your feelings." I told her I did
well on Trilafon, but she said the doctor had ordered a different
type of medication. Before I even knew it, she had given
me a shot of something that put me to sleep.


When the doctor arrived, he shook me awake and asked
me questions about what day of the month it was, who was
the president, and what was meant by the saying "People in
glass houses shouldn't throw stones." There's a standard drill
that psychiatrists, nurses, and social workers use to determine
the extent of your dementia. It's a useful screening
device, I know, but when you're asked these questions time
and again, as I was, it feels like they're toying with you; it's
an insult to your intelligence. Sometimes I knew the month;
sometimes I didn't. Sometimes I knew and wouldn't say.


I told the doctor about the overwhelming feeling of
depression I was experiencing. In answer to his questions, I
also told him of my previous hospitalizations for mental illness.
He arranged to have me taken by ambulance to Fort
Logan Mental Health Center. I asked him to make sure that I
wouldn't be placed in restraints since I was entering voluntarily

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dale Woods was the social worker assigned to me at the
hospital. Thin, short, with curly blond hair, Mr. Woods
walked with a pronounced limp. He nodded in understanding
when I explained my symptoms. "My older sister hears
voices," he said. "Like you, she's often been hospitalized
after serious suicide attempts." Mr. Woods was the only professional
I'd met in the system who revealed a family connection
to someone who was schizophrenic. This disclosure
totally disarmed me. I spoke to him for more than two and
a half hours that first time. Of course I told him about
Karl's abandoning me, which had led to this latest, deepest
depression.


"We need to find out about Karl," Mr. Woods said. He
offered to call the Brown Palace Hotel to confirm the dates of
our stay, after which he would phone Karl in Chicago, with
my permission. I agreed. When Mr. Woods came to see me
the next afternoon, I knew at once that something was
wrong. He seemed to drag himself into the room reluctantly.
His limp was more pronounced. "Your friend Karl committed
suicide," he said, almost in a whisper. "He took an overdose
of sleeping pills and alcohol."


I couldn't find words to respond. Instead, I looked out a
window at some trees swaying from the strength of the

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I didn't cry. In the days and weeks that followed, Mr.
Woods helped me work through my grief. He gave me a copy
of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross's book <i>On Death and Dying</i>, and I
began the process of accepting Karl's suicide. But I continued
to avoid and deny my loss of myself (the person I could have
been) to my disease.


"'Mr. Steele has made vast improvements in his affect and
attitude toward life, no longer posing a danger to himself,'"
Mr. Woods read aloud to me from the notes he was making
on my chart in preparation for my discharge from the hospital.
I'd told him that I wanted to live in a halfway house and
look for a job again. He explained that the job came first
here; once I had one, I needed to seek acceptance at one of
the halfway houses that had a vacancy.


I applied for the job of orderly or cook at four nursing
homes in the area. At one, I was quickly called back for a
second interview. They had reached my former employer, the
nursing home near the Westboro campus, and received a
good reference. I was hired as an orderly. There was other
good news for me. Apparently, I'd left my former post before
receiving my last paycheck. I had but to call with my current
address and the money would be forwarded.


Job in hand, I applied and was accepted for admittance to
a halfway house. I had mixed feelings about leaving the hospital

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mr. Woods encouraged me to take a high school equivalency
exam, earn my diploma, and go on to nursing school.
But the voices said no. Vociferously. <i>You'll flunk the test,
Kenny, I heard. You didn't get through high school the first time,
and you won't make it now. ... You're a loser, a mental misfit
who should have been aborted</i>.


Try as I did to bury my deepening sorrow, I soon found
myself repeating an all-too-familiar pattern. One night, I
walked away from house, job, and therapist for no discernible
reason except that the voices told me to do it. They
were a part of me, like the hair on my head, the nails on my
fingers. I needed to prove they were right, to show that I was
a failure at everything.


I spent about a week on the streets of Denver, hunched in
doorways, at times curled beneath boxes soaked from a
steady, cold rain. Then I hit the road, drifting like a scrap of
paper in whatever direction the wind might take me. The
voices wanted me to walk into heavy, fast-moving traffic and
get hit by a truck.


<i>A big truck will squash you like a wild rabbit or a skunk,
they told me. You're too insignificant to bring harm to the</i>

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976815-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I walked for a day and a half along Highway 25, waiting
for the right-sized truck and the right moment to throw
myself in front of it (when there'd be no other traffic and,
therefore, no possibility of a pileup causing harm to anyone
else). Eventually, a state trooper spotted me and pulled over.
I was actively hallucinating. Once more through the revolving
door. I soon found myself in restraints again, being taken
by ambulance to yet another facility.


Pueblo State Hospital in Pueblo, Colorado, is a place to
revisit only in memory--and even then, briefly. Seclusion
here was not a room, but a closet. It felt as if they had opened
a large drawer in a wall, containing a mattress, placed me
inside (still in restraints), and closed the drawer. The top of
the drawer was open but covered by a thick metal screen.
Metal bars ran horizontally across the space, preventing me
