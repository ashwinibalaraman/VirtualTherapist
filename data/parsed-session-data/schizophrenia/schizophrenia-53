BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> How are you today?
<b>PT:</b> I'm doing better as far as the Xanax is concerned.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I get that we tried to wean me down to none at all every other day.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> I had 2 mg so I started alternating 3 mg, 2 mg,3 mg, 2 mg, 2 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg. The weekend is the hardest, I don't know why.
<b>DR:</b> What weekends would be the easiest because that's when, um, you have lot of time with your family.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And why should you have, yknow, you should be busy on those days.
<b>PT:</b> I think that's why cause it's like been, it's a panic, I've gotta get everything done in two days so I think that's what the problem is, but the two Xanax is actually sufficing.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And not making me as drowsy, um, as the 3 mg. The 3 mg I notice were making me drowsier, so I am very satisfied that I've gone down at least one full mg.
<b>DR:</b> So for your bipolar we are using Lexapro 20 in the morning, Lamictal 200 twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And Seroquel 300 mg at bedtime.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Given the past history of benzodiazepam dependence we are still struggling with that.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Am I correct?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. Sleeping at night is hard.
<b>DR:</b> Tell me what's been happening with your life?
<b>PT:</b> I just got back from [DEIDENTIFIED]. I have a mother who has, a grandmother who has Alzheimer's.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> She's [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I just got back last week. My grandfather, step-grandfather, he's [AGE]. I just found out on the way here that they have just admitted him into the hospital, um, he's got congestive heart failure and fluid on the lungs.
<b>DR:</b> Why, uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> [AGE] he doesn't want to live anymore. He said nobody should live, I mean, he's told me nobody should live to be [AGE] and be, he's sharp up here, it's his health that's failing so he feels all the agony and all the pain, but he can't make it go away.  The doctors are treating him as much as possible, but his aspect is I don't want to live any longer. I've led a long happy life, I'm [AGE] years old and he's just sick and tired of being sick and tired.
<b>DR:</b> He does not want to be the centurion?
<b>PT:</b> No, no.  My grandmother on the other hand has Alzheimer's and she, that was a very stressful trip for me because that was the first time I've seen her since the dementia had gotten worse. Um, she yelled at me a couple times and my grandmother has been like my mother to me.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So I was not used to her actions and she's not the same person that she was when I saw her four years ago. That was very stressful. I had a stressful trip home. I got kicked off an airline cause I had an asthma attack and they gave me oxygen, that's a long story in itself and it wasn't a pleasant trip home. So stresses has been -
 
DR: Did you finally drive or did you take another?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I had to go to the emergency room and have a doctor release me to be able to fly home. So I had to spend the night in the airport cause [DEIDENTIFIED] doesn't give out vouchers and be at the airport at five o'clock in the morning so I kinda just from two to five, cause I was in the emergency room waiting to be seen in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Hum. 
<b>PT:</b> So when I got there I think there was like fifty people in the emergency room. Hospital was great, they gave me a voucher to get back to the airport, but, um, nothing out of [DEIDENTIFIED]. I understand apparently because they gave me oxygen they don't tell you if we give you oxygen, they didn't put the mask over cause I couldn't breathe, it was just, yknow, um -
<b>DR:</b> Suffocating.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah exactly so they held it out and I was breathing, but they didn't tell me because they give me oxygen I would be removed off the plane, have a doctor's release to get back on the plane.  If I would of known that, I had my inhaler, I just needed time to calm down, take my, but the air compres, the air -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. 
<b>PT:</b> It complicated it a little bit more, it was harder to catch my breath so they kinda did what they were supposed to do as flight attendants, but.
<b>DR:</b> So was your husband around?
<b>PT:</b> No, I was by myself.
<b>DR:</b> So after how long is being that you were out by yourself?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I got out, uh, Wednesday I got home. I missed a whole day of work because I couldn't go to work that day and it's just, I've been very depressed lately because I've been worried about my grandma, worried about not being there now that my grandpa, um, my husband and I haven't been getting along.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I was overdoing my medication.
<b>DR:</b> Again? What did you overdo?
<b>PT:</b> The Xanax and I had, somebody gave me some Lexapro so he's very angry with me right now and he doesn't know what he's gonna do with me, um, he's tired of it.
<b>DR:</b> Now in the past I don't have in the record, but in the past is it true that you have taken over, gone to [DEIDENTIFIED] or to some other states to meet other people?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I did that one time.
<b>DR:</b> For sexual purposes?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I did that one time.
<b>DR:</b> Did that happen one time only?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, but nothing happened I just did the stupidity of driving down there, thinking I was going to with the anxiety or the manic.
<b>DR:</b> Mania.
<b>PT:</b> The manic part of it and honestly I think the manic is the part of the medication cause I know that if I have it I'm gonna take it because it's gonna make me feel better and it's a manic, I don't know it just calms me down. Makes me, but he tells, he can tell, he says I slur my words, I'm staggering. I can't see it, but he sees me, he knows when I've overdone my drugs. Now he's at the point where my drugs are not locked up anymore. He is giving them to me every day.
<b>DR:</b> So he's giving them out?
<b>PT:</b> I had none today. I've had no medication today at all.
<b>DR:</b> Even not your Lexapro, Lamictal or Seroquel?
<b>PT:</b> No, or Xanax. I haven't had anything.
<b>DR:</b> That's disastrous.
<b>PT:</b> He didn't give it to me today. He was upset with me last night. I, well, I guess I might as well just share it all. I was depressed and I didn't do it, yknow, people do try to commit suicide because they really don't wanna live. I know that. I wanted to hurt and I did that and I just wanted to hurt myself because.
<b>DR:</b> Did you cut your wrist?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> When was that?
<b>PT:</b> Last night.
<b>DR:</b> How come I didn't get called?
<b>PT:</b> Nobody was home.
<b>DR:</b> You were home.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> So how come you didn't call?
<b>PT:</b> I did it cause I stopped cause I was just like, I just wanted to hurt myself. I don't want to die, I know I don't want, but I just, I just want to hurt because I'm hurting everybody else and I don't know how to stop. I don't know how to stop taking medications that's given to me. I can't stop taking the medication that I know the more I take the better it's gonna feel. I am a fucking drug addict and I swore up and down I would never be like that and here I, if somebody hands me a Lexapro, or I mean a Lortab and says here, I'm gonna take it. I have got an addictive, of which you've told me, I've got a very addictive personality.
<b>DR:</b> There's no such thing as an addicting personality in the book.
<b>PT:</b> Well, somebody's told me that cause it's come out somewhere.
<b>DR:</b> In the book, some books say and our bible in psychiatry is DSM4TR there's nothing called addictive personality disorder so do not take the shield behind it. There's no such thing. When you are at the peak of mania then you do some choices, decisions, uh, that might be irrational and because that's just a part of the disease, but if you are mad at your husband or if you're mad at your kids and try and do great even with them by doing something that you agree as a family that you would not do, who are you hurting?
<b>PT:</b> I'm hurting them.
<b>DR:</b> No, you are not, you are hurting you.
<b>PT:</b> I'm hurting them because of the fact that I've hurt them over and over and over again.
<b>DR:</b> All their choices will be the least point of their threshold.
<b>PT:</b> So by my choice.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> So by my choices and all those bad choices that I'm, that I'm hurting myself, they're just catching the tail end of it.
<b>DR:</b> That's right, because they care for you.
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I don't feel like they do. Sometimes I feel like if I wanna talk about my grandma, or what's going on with [NAME OTHER], it's just like I know, I know, well what do you want me to do? There's nothing you can do about it.
<b>DR:</b> So much ahead of their agenda, you're skipping number 7 and going to number 32.  How could you go to 32 if you haven't gotten to 9 or 10.
<b>PT:</b> You sound just like my husband. There's nothing I can do to prevent.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I'm your doctor and I'm trying to keep in train. Are you back to work?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So now six months ago that was not in the horizon.  You did not believe that you would be able to go back to work. You are all set to go for disability, but you have been able to overcome that.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> It took time. I agree similarly some of the situations you can do that can be easily done. It's okay. But there are other situations it takes long hard work. Imagine this scenario, either when you are significantly manic or you are significantly depressed and you did something like you say are stupid, that you are kicked out of the house or you are kicked out of the job. Now tell me in this hypothetical situation what will be your resources?
<b>PT:</b> I have none.
<b>DR:</b> Now you are not in the middle of crisis, ma'am. We have gone through crisis for the last six months.  I've pulled my hair off of my head and you can see 50% of them are gone. Not all for you, but part of it is for you. I have several others for which I have to pull hair. But the thing is, is that we did it, but how you deal with your family members I really cannot get involved in that.  Ask yourself which one would be more important, going out and partying with your kids, having good sex somewhere in [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] or staying at home with your husband. Which one is important? I cannot make that decision. That's your call. Now that because you are in between the crisis not overly depressed on one hand and not overly depressed on the mania. Taking your total medication, not much side effects, going back to full time work, that means you are in between two crisis. When we are in between two crisis that is the repair time. When we are in the middle of the crisis as we had six months ago there was no time to repair. That was time to survive. How can I prevent from going to the hospital. We just gave [INAUDIBLE]. 
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum, yes [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], few days ago. 
<b>PT:</b> No
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's how we came to decisions. 
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, but that was a while back.
<b>DR:</b> It's almost six months now.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That I have been able to keep you out of the hospital.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But, ma'am, if you cannot start with us, if you were [AGE] or [AGE] who does things before they think and gets into trouble. You are well ahead in the game. You need to think okay I want to buy that Porsche, the red and gold, what's the return for that? And in this particular case your husband and family is involved, ma'am. Not only yourself. 
<b>PT:</b> I guess I just keep looking for that magic pill that's gonna.
<b>DR:</b> There ain't any magic pill.
<b>PT:</b> Magic pills.
<b>DR:</b> I'm telling you up front. There ain't any magic pill that will fix you. This is one of the best forms that I have seen. You can build up on top of that or that is that you can do it, maybe slow, but can do it.
<b>PT:</b> Then there's setbacks.  Just like that there's a setback and I don't know what caused, I guess the whole trip home and the depression and it just, and it's just I was doing really well. I was proud of myself. I even told my husband.
<b>DR:</b> I'm still proud of you.
<b>PT:</b> Because I said I went down from 3 mg to 2 mg on my own, even though [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said skip every other day, I changed it and went slowly down and now I can handle 2 mg a day and then.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, next target will be 1 mg a day.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> All right?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay at present you are taking Lexapro 20 mg in the morning.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. Which one is for the depression?
<b>DR:</b> Lexapro.
<b>PT:</b> That's what I thought.
<b>DR:</b> And then Lamictal 100 mg twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Then the third one is Seroquel 300 at bedtime.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And the other one is Xanax XR
<b>PT:</b> 2 mg. 
<b>DR:</b> 2 mg if needed basis, right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So you don't need any prescriptions today do you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I, can I have them faxed into my medical mail in?
<b>DR:</b> You have to fax it, I can write it for you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah, nobody's faxing them anymore; they're making you mail them in.
<b>DR:</b> Right, because we are having lot of problems.
<b>PT:</b> That's fine as long I get that, as long as we can get them mailed in so that we get the-
<b>DR:</b> Lexapro 20 mg one in the morning, [INAUDIBLE], no refills. Then Lamictal 100 mg.  I'll, yeah, taking twice a day right?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> 60 none, 180 none.
<b>PT:</b> We're doing the 90 days again?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum. And then Seroquel you're taking 300 mg at bedtime right?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And the Xanax I'm going to give you a very small amount 1 mg.
<b>PT:</b> 1 mg?
<b>DR:</b> 25 mg twice a day 30 of those.
<b>PT:</b> I don't take them twice a day though, I take them in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> That's fine, I gave you a little extra.
<b>PT:</b> Can't I stick with the 2 mg for a while?
<b>DR:</b> Huh?
<b>PT:</b> Can't I stick with the 2 mg for a while?
<b>DR:</b> 2 mg of what?
<b>PT:</b> The Xanax for a while.
<b>DR:</b> No, no, no, no, no. I'm going to get you off of the Xanax. You have used it for long time. You have a choice between Xanax or me. Pick your choice.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  If 1 mg doesn't work then go ahead and take.
<b>DR:</b> Keep it in your mind, keep the determination it will work, it does.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, here is your four prescriptions and I will see you back in about, this visit was three months right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Three months. Any questions for me, ma'am?
<b>PT:</b> Nope.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
