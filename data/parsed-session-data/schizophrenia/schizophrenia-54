BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, the, the, again, the question has to do with the <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> part of this.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Um, and one of the things that we have seen sort of, as our understanding of, of bipolar illness has evolved is that some people have more paranoia, more delusions, more auditory hallucinations, that sort of thing and that sort of sounds like what you were having, particularly when you were admitted to the hospital in May.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, it was really bad, I mean, even, this day, I don't like windows.  Windows scare me.  I'm always thinking somebody is watching me out there.
<b>DR:</b> Are you okay on a high floor like this?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Is this okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, this is okay, but - 
<b>DR:</b> But if we were down on the first floor.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I would have to be, probably - 
<b>DR:</b> Close the blinds and that sort of thing.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, oh yeah, even in my house we have to pull down blinds, cross the curtains over both my bedrooms windows.  I can't sleep next to the window at all.  I sleep in the middle of the bed.  
<b>DR:</b> Are you, are, are you able to put your finger on what it is you're afraid of?
<b>PT:</b> Somebody coming in to get me.  I don't know.  It just, I feel like they're gonna hurt me.
<b>DR:</b> Is it anybody in particular?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Just, I mean - 
<b>DR:</b> So it's not some agency or some -
<b>PT:</b> No.  I, it could be anybody.
<b>DR:</b> The Labor Department or just anybody.
<b>PT:</b> It's anybody, I mean -
<b>DR:</b> Have you ever had anybody, like your ex-husband, come after you?
<b>PT:</b> Uh no, not at all.
<b>DR:</b> Anybody ever stalk you?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Or tracked you or followed you?  Or anything like that?
<b>PT:</b> Never, never.
<b>DR:</b> Ever been assaulted?
<b>PT:</b> Nope.  Never have.  I said and even like goin' to, like even like goin' to the bathroom, yknow, I, I, I, there is like, we have like a stainglass window next, there's a shower with the glass blocks and here's the toilet.  I can't even go in there without pulling the blinds down even to get in the shower.  I can take the bottom part off, but I will get into my shower, close the shower curtain, take my top off.  I'm just so scared somebody's gonna see me or, yknow, see what I'm doing or see that I'm talking on the phone and see who I'm talking to or -
<b>DR:</b> Well, now, I know that you're taking the Seroquel and you're taking 800 mg and if you miss a dose this is all worse?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, then it gets worse.  Then that's more visual.  That's when I see things in the trees, in fact, we live out in [DEIDENTIFIED] where it's a lot of trees and my bedroom is on the bottom floor and I can swear, especially it's worse at night, that I see people, or shadows moving and it just, yknow a car light goes by and it is like, okay, God, are they slowing down in front of the house, are they watching.
<b>DR:</b> How long have you had that?
<b>PT:</b> It's been -
<b>DR:</b> When did it st -
<b>PT:</b> I can remember this ever since I was a kid.  I always hated windows.  I have always been afraid.
<b>DR:</b> So you have always been fearful and anxious and -
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I mean, right now, I mean, I'm just, I mean, I've got sweat just dripping off me, me talking about it makes me so, it just freaks me out.
<b>DR:</b> But you've never, you've never reached a conclusion that it was anybody in particular?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh, no.
<b>DR:</b> It's on the CIA or anybody like that?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So, it's just, it's just, is it more like prowlers -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Or somebody in the yard or -
<b>PT:</b> It's just somebody out there watching, seeing what I'm doing. It's like, yknow, and this sounds kind of crazy, like I was telling my other, uh, counselor, yknow, it's like if I had aliens watching me they would really hate to take me with them or something, it's like, yknow, what is she doing?  She's strange, yknow, I, it's just kind of like, they are just watching m, I guess how like how I, how I do normal life.  It's just kinda, it's weird.  I mean, I don't even know kind of how to explain it.  It's like they are watching me watch TV, they're just -
<b>DR:</b> Well has this -
<b>PT:</b> They're just watching what I'm doin, yknow -
<b>DR:</b> Has this all gotten any better since you've started the medicines?
<b>PT:</b> It's gotten better, like one night I notice like I said, when I know it's more audio now.  And it's, when I first got onto the medication, which was in May, I mean it was bad.  Now it's where I can hear and sometimes it's mumbled and it's like I can make out voices, but I'm not knowing what they're saying to me and they are not telling me to hurt anybody it's more they're talking about me.  Yknow, it's like they're downing me. 
<b>DR:</b> So do they criticize you?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do they comment on what you're doing?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, like my mom came in the room one time and she was sitting on the bed and we were just talking and they were like my mom's kind of gotten messed up teeth and they were like, Oh, look at her teeth, yknow, look at her hair. Yknow it was like, and I talked back and she was like, what, yknow, what are you doing, [PATIENT NAME]?  And I started talking about, yknow, I was just, yknow, I was defending my mom because, yknow, they were talking bad about her.
<b>DR:</b> So do you know who these voices are?
<b>PT:</b> No, I think they are coming from, like we have, um, the vents in the ceiling and I think they're in there.  I think they're like, they have like videos, like, like little, I can't think, like the spy cameras and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Little cameras of some sort?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, in there or in my bathroom.  It's really only in my bathroom and my bedroom, it's not - 
<b>DR:</b> Do you have any, any, any sense of why they would pick on you?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Why would they be monitoring you or keeping you under surveillance or - 
<b>PT:</b> That I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Do they, do they use like tape recorders?
<b>PT:</b> They tell me that how I'm worthless, how fat I've gotten.  It's like look at her and then, yknow, I got real bad, like yknow, sweating problems, if I, if I get nervous yknow, then that gets something worked up and then they talk about me.  I got this thing about smells and okay, she's smelling, because I know I'm sweating and they're talking about that.  And it's like, then I have to go take a shower, yknow, so they're just, I don't know why they're, if somebody walks in my room, they, I mean it's not all the time I can hear them talk about, like their saying look at her hair or look at my mom's teeth or look at that outfit she's got on and then I will say something and yknow, she kind of then makes, I told mom, I said, I'm not crazy, I'm really hearing it and yknow, and she's like, I'm not hearing anything, [PATIENT NAME], yknow, and she's like, Where do you hear it from?  And so I tell her there is 2 vents, there's one in my bathroom and one in my bedroom and that - 
<b>DR:</b> And so all of this is with all the medicines that you take everyday?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Your Seroquel 800, your Lexapro 20, your Depakote 750, your Clonazepam twice a day at 0.5 -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And the Temazepam at bedtime.  And regardless of the medicines, you still have all these symptoms?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yes.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, it's getting better, but still, I mean, I can't even go in public without worrying about somebody talking about me and if they are watching me.  I can't make eye contact with somebody whose a stranger.  Like if I have to go to like Wal-Mart to pick up a medication I don't want nobody looking at me, nobody making eye contact with me.  I want to get in and get out, yknow, I'm still worried about then if somebody switches lanes it is like, okay, why did they switch lanes then they were behind me.  Is it something I, yknow, what is it yknow, cause like I will hear them talking or something and it is like I think they are talking about me all this time. 
<b>DR:</b> So the, the paranoid part, the hallucinating part, the sort of almost delusional in the false beliefs about what is going on part is all pretty clear, where does the bipolar part come in?  Where did that, when you said that the doctor said you had manic - 
<b>PT:</b> I, I guess just because I just been so depressed, I don't know, I mean -
<b>DR:</b> So it is more the depressed side than it is, so for you, you have the depressed side, but you also have this other side which is the hyper -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Vigilant scared -
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Aanxious, nervous.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, always, I mean, you can look at me, I just, I can't, I can't stop, it's like my brain goes 90 to nothing all the time.
<b>DR:</b> So, so, it's pretty clear that you have this clustering symptoms that's part of an illness, okay, it's pretty clear about that and it got bad enough that you got hospitalized.  
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And you got on some medicines and things are better, but you've gained 60 pounds.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, look at me, I was 125 and I weighed 190 and myself today before I came here, I'm 197 right now.
<b>DR:</b> So you gained, almost 75 pounds.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> 72 pounds yes, okay.  And you, of course would like to go back to weighing - 
<b>PT:</b> Oh gosh, yeah, I would, yknow, love to.
<b>DR:</b> Well, the, the, the, the 2 medicines that you are talking, well actually the Lexapro is not blameless in this, but Depakote and Seroquel both can have significant weight gain. 
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Now, the problem, of course, is that you probably have just fresh bottles that you have just recently filled.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, so yknow, it's, it's, it's, um, we really um, and, and in addition to that, the meds really aren't working that well.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Because one of the things, your Depakote dose is pretty low, 750 is probably not enough.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> The Seroquel dose at 800 is enough -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> But it is not holding you.  
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> It's not treating all this, so at a minimum we probably should change the, well, change the dose of the Depakote -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> At least temporarily change the Seroquel to something that might work better that doesn't have the weight gain associated with it. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Now there are 2 medicines that we can use, that don't have weight gain, well 2 that don't.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> One is Geodon -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And the other is Abilify.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And my Geodon samples are pretty low, but I think I have Abilify.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And so we can use some Abilify.  And the dose of Abilify that you need may be substantially lower than 800 mg because there, the doses there are 10, 15, 20 mg.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And what we will probably do is to start you on, I will look and see what kind of samples I have -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But ta, ta, ta stop your Seroquel and we will do that over, yknow, over the course of a few days -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Go from 800 to 600 to 400 to 200 and then stop -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Meanwhile we will start you on Abilify.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  
<b>DR:</b> And Abilify does several things.  First of all, it has, it has good benefits for the fear or the view of things, the voices and all that sort of thing.  It also is a good antidepressant.  It has antidepressant effects.  So, that's an advantage.  So we would start you on that.  Then the second thing we would do would be probably, this is a temporary because you have plenty of Depakote -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Would be to double your Depakote dose.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> To go from one 3 times a day or 250 yknow, in the morning -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And 500 at night, to 500 in the morning and probably 1,000 mg at night.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Which means that we are going to double your dose because it's not, I worry less about your blood level -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> With the Depakote than I do about the, the fact that it's not holding you -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> It's not working.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, and then do that over maybe even, see because, the other thing that is of concern to me is that you're not working.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And we need to get you back to work so you can drive -
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you can work, so you can pay attention on the phones -
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you can deal with your work at [DEIDENTIFIED] and take care of business.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, I can't - 
<b>DR:</b> So, we need to do it fairly quickly.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, maybe just make this change for a week and have you come back in another week and see where you are.  Now, I think the Depakote is gonna need to be changed also.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And there is some, there is some good medicines that we can switch too pretty easily that are not necessarily, well, let me tell you about bipolar illness.  Bipolar illness, the bipolar part of the schizoaffective part -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Because of the family history of your mom and dad.  The way we treat bipolar illness is we use mood stabilizers.  Depakote is a mood stabilizer, okay, but there are a number of medicines that we, that we have available to us, including Lithium and Tegretol and Trileptal and Lamictal and the best treatment for the bipolar part, because of all the depression that you've been having, in addition to all this paranoia side, is Lamictal -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But it is difficult to add Lamictal into Depakote without, I'd like to get you off of Depakote quickly onto something you could switch to rapidly -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> To get your weight down.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay good.
<b>DR:</b> The last person that I did this too has lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks -
<b>PT:</b> Oh good.
<b>DR:</b> Already.  
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I -
<b>DR:</b> She's already losing weight.  She already feels better.  And she was on Depakote for 10 years.
<b>PT:</b> I can't, there was days I couldn't even get out of bed, but then there's days when I want to go and I'm cleaning the house and I'm doing this and I'm doing that and then I can just bawl out in tears and my parents just look at me like, yknow, it's just another day for me.  Like, I'm tearing up, it's just like yknow, I feel like I'm a prisoner in my own house cause I just, I don't want to get out of bed somedays.  It's just, yknow -
<b>DR:</b> Now -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay so we've addressed the Seroquel.  
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And I'll write all this down for you too.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay, thank you.
<b>DR:</b> I'm just kind of talking right now.  We've addressed the Seroquel, switch over to Abilify.  We've addressed the Depakote leveling until next week when we can make a change there.  The Clonazepam is fine, except you can take more clonazepam than that, particularly at bedtime
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Or in the middle of the night if you wake up.  
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Help you sleep.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, I didn't know that.
<b>DR:</b> Now, the other thing it's your Temazepam dose -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Restoril is the name of that -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> It's to low.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You need to be on at least 2.  Well, 2 is max dose really, but -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> If you take a couple of Clonazepam at bedtime along with 2 Temazepam -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And the Abilify and we double your Seroquel to 1,000 mg at bedtime -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You ought to sleep.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay, good.
<b>DR:</b> That's a big slug of meds at night -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And it ought to help you sleep.  And it's not gonna knock you out.  I mean, it may knock you out during your sleep period -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But when you wake up in the morning maybe the first couple of days you will be a little groggy -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Groggy but it will clear.  The Lexapro, we will leave alone for the moment.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You maybe able to get off that in time.  Um, that sometimes has weight gain associated with it, but I don't think it's the culprit in your 75 pound weight gain.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I think it's the other 2 medicines.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  That's what I was thinking because the Seroquel makes me crave sweets.  It's just like -
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> It's that, I want something sweet, when I take it, it is like 30 minutes later where is a candy bar, where is sugar.  I just, I don't care what it is I have to get that urge and then it's like okay, then I can calm, kind of calm down and then I can get into bed and turn the TV on and kind of relax then.  You know what problem I noticed, I have a hard time swallowing.
<b>DR:</b> Hm?  Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Is that normal on that?
<b>DR:</b> On the Seroquel?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It maybe a side effect of the Seroquel. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> That certainly may go away if you have trouble swallowing anyway, it may not so much yet, but we'll have to kind of see.
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> Let me get you some sam, some samples of the, um, Abilify -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then I'll make some of these.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, no problem. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, all right, good.  I have a sample of the Abilify 15 mg, which is a starting dose for a lot of people who have kind of what you have.  If you weren't taking any Seroquel at all I would probably start you on 15.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You may need 20, so -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> 15 and 5, so and you may need 30, so we'll adjust your dose according to where you are.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Let me write some notes for you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Now, should I still go see my other counselor on top of seeing you too?
<b>DR:</b> Sure, oh yeah, that's fine. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> She's very helpful, that's fine.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, now the other thing too of course is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] will probably be happy not to have to prescribe your medicines anymore for you.  So what I'll do is as they come up and need to be refilled and so forth -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I will write them for you because we are going to be making some changes -
<b>PT:</b> Okay, okay.
<b>DR:</b> But right now, go ahead and use the prescription bottles that you have and when do you see her again?
<b>PT:</b> I haven't seen her in about a month.  She told me as long as I thought I was doing okay, and then I made an appointment with you after that kind of, I thought about killing myself thing, then [DEIDENTIFIED] wanted me to come see you just to make sure I had a higher level of care and make sure I didn't do anything.  Now with me being so scatter brained, I mean, is that something that is going to go away too with it?
<b>DR:</b> It may go away, it may not.  It may require some additional treatment.  If, a lot of people who have these kinds of disorders also have attention deficit problems, but the medicines that we use for attention deficit we're always afraid may make things worse -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So we want to get you settled and stabilized on a combination of medicines and then we can add in medicines for attention deficit.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay, okay, good.
<b>DR:</b> And it won't take -
<b>PT:</b> That long.
<b>DR:</b> Several weeks maybe to get that done.  I'm hopping.  Okay, so the first thing is the Depakote and 2 we're going to have you reduce the Seroquel to 600, 400, 200, then discontinue -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> In the next 3 days or so.  And then we are going to have you start the Abilify 15 mg at bedtime tonight.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then we are going to have you continue Lexapro, for now, and increase your Temazepam to 30 mg at bedtime.  And then we are going to increase your Clonazepam to, and you can take even 1 to 2 mg, that's 2 to 4 tablets.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And you can take extra Dramamite for now.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, Depakote, Seroquel, Abilify, Lexapro, Temazepam, Clonazepam, that's it.  Okay.  Oh, the other thing is on that Abilify you can take 15 or 20.
<b>PT:</b> 15 or 20, okay.  
<b>DR:</b> Okay, questions for me?
<b>PT:</b> Nope.  How often do I, do I get see you?
<b>DR:</b> Um, well I'm gonna see you in a week.
<b>PT:</b> Okay good.
<b>DR:</b> And then if everything is going okay, I'll probably see you in two.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> If everything stabilizes out I'll probably see you in a month after that, it depends on how frequently. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  And I can still go talk to her and everything.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, absolutely.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, good.  Okay, I wanted to make sure of that though.
<b>DR:</b> Perfect, okay.
