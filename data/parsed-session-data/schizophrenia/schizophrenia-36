It is a daring thing to give over our reticences
into the keeping of another and to accept the responsibility
of being custodian of theirs.


<i>Wheels on Gravel</i>, Alyse Gregory


ON A COOL April morning in 1962, a police sergeant in a small
country town received an urgent call from a station over a
hundred miles away. Phlegmatically he took down the message.
A woman suffering from an overdose of sleeping pills was
believed to be lying in a car parked on a track ‘somewhere up
in the downs’. It was vital to find her at once. There was a
chance that she might still be alive.


The sergeant put down the telephone and walked over to the
wall map. A track on the downs? The downs were criss-crossed
by tracks like wrinkles on a venerable forehead. But his experienced
eye knew just which tracks were negotiable by a car;
his worldly wisdom, based on a lifetime&apos;s knowledge of the
frailties of human nature, shrewdly selected the spots most apt
to the taste of a suicide. Intuition must also have played its part
in this policeman&apos;s subtle psyche, for, summoning a constable
to drive his car, he went straight to the spot where I was lying.
He smashed open the window and felt my pulse.


‘Nearly gone,’ he observed to his junior. ‘Get into her car,
Harry. We&apos;ll drive her straight down to the hospital as she is.’


Sitting in the rear seat, his expert finger on my wrist, the
sergeant gave his directions to the appalled young constable.
Perhaps I was the first suicide that this boy had seen and I
know now that I was bloated and purple-faced, altogether a
nasty spectacle. Urged on by the sergeant, who realised that
my time was running out, the constable drove the heavy car
down the uneven rutted track, endeavouring to reconcile speed
with care for my nearly-extinguished spirit. It was about five

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The track ended and the constable was out on the main
road, driving as fast as he dared. As the car approached the
outskirts of the town a loud, persistent metallic banging made
itself heard from the front of the car.


The constable drives doggedly on. The banging is now
regular. Clang! Clang with every revolution of the wheels. He
feels an unpleasant pull on the steering, and grips the wheel
anxiously.


Passers-by in the street are now standing and staring at the
curious sight -- a very old saloon car exceeding the speed limit
to the accompaniment of a din like the clashing of dustbin lids
-- a car manned by two desperate policemen who look as if
they are escaping from the law rather than serving it.


The young constable swung the car into the hospital yard
at last and the stretcher men took over. Stomach-pumped,
unconscious, I lay inert in my iron bed.


Outside the two policemen looked anxiously at the car.


The junior pointed gloomily at one of the front wheels. The
rim had rusted off. The tyre was bulging out, hideously unsafe.
It was the loose rim, bowling round like a hoop, which
had produced the regular banging. That providence which
shapes our ends had brought the car into the hospital yard
only a matter of seconds before the tyre would inevitably have
burst and a well-meaning sergeant would probably have had
me dying in his arms within sight of rescue.


The four days of perpetual night in which I lay in the hospital
would not have been wasted if I had died, but now that

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was only in hospital for one week and was then brought
to a London nursing-home where some of my friends visited
me. Only two or three knew what had happened. Among
these was Helen, a married woman a little younger than myself.
I had known her for about ten years. Our friendship had
for more than half of that time been of a pleasant but hardly
intimate social nature, confined to going out to dinner with
her and her husband, or occasionally visiting a theatre or
concert hall. I had established with them a fairly easy relationship
on limited terms, but I came to feel, even though
I did not see them often, that I could trust them, and for
Helen I came to have a deeper affection. I was aware that if I
needed to step closer to her, she would not reject me; that
there was a reserve of love -- I am not now speaking in lesbian
terms -- building up between us upon which either of us could
draw if we were in trouble.


By the time of my suicide I had already drawn upon this
reserve. This was in 1961, when it became clear to me that my
affair with Elizabeth was breaking up. I told Helen about it
one evening when I was alone with her. I asked her to help
Elizabeth if she could. It was an important step that I took,
and I took it because I at last realised that the only solution
to our ravelled affair might have to be that we parted for
good.


It had not been easy to arrive at this point. For me it was a

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Yet only a few months before, in the spring of 1961, Elizabeth
and I had gone away together as lovers, and recaptured
among the hills and woods of south Wiltshire the happiness
that had seemed lost. We walked day after day in the downs.
We made love, still with miraculous ardour. The impending
break-up of our relationship was never spoken of. It was temporarily
walled out. We slept peacefully. I nearly always woke
before she did, and I would watch her lying beside me, entirely
content and unafraid, because it was impossible to believe that
this must come to an end.


I remember one morning very clearly. I woke in the early
light. Elizabeth was lying on her back, unmoving in sleep,
relaxed and peaceful. The blankets had fallen away to her
waist and her hands were crossed over her breast, as though she
were an effigy resting upon an altar tomb. In those moments
before the dawn, it was unbelievable to suppose that the clear
light playing over the scene was only an <i>ignis fatuus</i>.


But when we returned, the affair began to show again the
stresses we had endured during the winter. I made a conventional
and rather half-hearted attempt to extricate myself
from the situation I was in by creating another one, which I
hoped might absorb me at least temporarily. I decided, quite
coldly and deliberately, to have an affair with a Welsh gynaecologist
whom I had known for a year or two. I stayed near
Cardiff with some friends and saw a good deal of Phyllis. I
allowed myself to be charmed with her Welsh intonation, and
her small, dark-haired Celtic appearance. I diverted the pain
I felt at the absence of letters from Elizabeth into a pleasurable

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Very late at night, I would drive back through the sombre,
empty Cardiff streets, my mind alive with anticipation of
erotic pleasures which I never in fact realised. When I was
with her, I withdrew into dreams, for to tell the truth, I did
not greatly enjoy her company. We had hardly a taste in
common and I secretly loathed the grim Welsh mountains
which meant so much to her. It was simply preferable, I found,
to endure the pangs of unrequited (and largely simulated)
desire to the desperate torment of loss.


So I kept myself going in Wales, cut off from Elizabeth, and
acutely aware that, when I went home, things would almost
certainly be worse for us. I argued with myself about my attractive
young doctor; I dreamed erotic dreams about her, and
corrected the imbalance of these moods of heady, effervescent
desire and leaden despair with long, cool draughts of Montaigne.
I read over and over again his essay on Solitariness,
perhaps foreseeing that I should do well to arm myself against
the life without love that was coming to me. I noted how a
mind ‘moving and turning in itself ... may keep itselfe company’;
I pondered his statement that ‘a man must sequester
and recover himself upon himselfe’. I knew I must break my
bondage and strengthen my spirit to live in my own company.
‘Shake we off these violent handfasts which elsewhere engage
us, and estrange us from ourselves,’ Montaigne urged me,
and argued with cogency what I knew in my heart to be true:
‘The greatest thing in the world is for a man to know how to
be his owne.’


I saw myself in bondage to Elizabeth and I knew that even
if I succeeded in freeing myself, or was driven away by her, I
had no company of my own to live with; that I was not my
own, indeed, and would have to learn Montaigne&apos;s lesson the
hard way.


Though I could not emulate them in their various philosophies
of living, I was thankful for the presence on my shelves

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When a letter arrived from Elizabeth, a miserable half page
telling me nothing, concealing much, I would seize my little
brown copies of Montaigne and open one at random, cling to
it fiercely and force my eyes to concentrate on the page. Never
have I felt so strongly that, despite the oblivion of death, a
man&apos;s spirit may live on in his pages and speak with a clear
voice down the centuries.


I suspected that Elizabeth, too, was having or at least contemplating,
an affair with someone else. Not till I returned
from Wales and began to see her again did I find out what
was going on, for of course she did not tell me, any more than
I divulged a word about my feelings for Phyllis. Elizabeth,
now certain that she desired marriage, was conducting a
grotesque and sentimental affair--you might call it, flying a
heterosexual kite--with a very old man, who persuaded himself
that he could, at the age of nearly eighty, prove an adequate
husband for a young woman in her thirties, and a father for
her children, if she had any. He proposed to her and when
she refused him, her common sense, as she told me later, convincing
her of the impracticality of marrying a man who would
leave her children fatherless at a tender age, and herself a
possibly unmarriageable widow, he tried to have an affair
with her. He inveigled her into sleeping with him by the hoary
device of deceiving her as to the time of the last train back to
London from his Hertfordshire home. There again, Elizabeth&apos;s
fortunate grasp of the practicalities of life prevented her from
allowing him full satisfaction. ‘I slept with him,’ she told me--
and I hardly recognised the Elizabeth I had known--‘But I
wouldn&apos;t let him have all he wanted. I wouldn&apos;t even have let
him come to bed with me if he wasn&apos;t so sweet and so genuinely
fond of me.’

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I listened to all this with bemused pain. I suppose that it
was better to know than to be continually suspecting and
wondering. I read with hopeful conviction Hardy&apos;s <i>In Tenebris</i>,
with its defiant pessimism: ‘If way to the better there be,
it exacts a full look at the worst.’ I felt sometimes that if only
Elizabeth and I could reach rock bottom, we could from there
move into a better, more enduring relationship---a common
delusion of lovers. Incapable though I was of making any
such gesture against the pain I was in, I read and re-read
John Cowper Powys&apos;s recipe for ending it by taking an
‘Ichthyan leap’, an act which he describes as ‘a swift lumping
together of all the evils in your life--as if you turned them into
one element that completely surrounds you--followed by a
fierce leap up of your inmost identity, a leap that takes you, if
only for a second, into the freer air.’


Tension mounted between Elizabeth and myself, both of us
guilty, both of us afraid of what we were secretly scheming to
do. We had, some months before, planned to go away for a
long weekend in September. Perhaps we were deluding ourselves
with the hope that it might repeat the happiness of the
spring. At the last minute, Elizabeth refused to go. It was the
first definite stand she had made against me and I knew that
it was a necessity to her.


On Friday, I woke up early. I looked out on a beautiful
autumnal morning, blue-grey with mist. I told myself that
there would be other autumns, but I had already made up my
mind that there would never be.


Later on that day, I examined the truth more closely than I
had hitherto done. I decided that I must help Elizabeth to free
herself from me. I recognised painfully but clearly that this
was her necessity. When she did not write to me or refused to
go away with me; when she insisted on my sleeping with her
and then turned her back upon me: these were symbolic acts
of rejection which she had not yet been able to bring herself to
act out in reality.


I did not believe that her liaison with Paul, any more than

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The autumn wore on into winter. In telling the tale to
Helen, I had freed myself of a burden which made it easier
for me to devote my mind seriously to what I was going to
do.


Elizabeth, too, had made a choice. She had given the <i>coup
de grâce</i> to her elderly lover, who was hurt but resigned. She
had applied for and obtained a very senior post in her profession.
Though it was obvious that I was to be jettisoned, it
seemed in the early New Year of 1962 that Elizabeth was not
rejecting me for anyone else, that she had given up thoughts
of marriage and resigned herself to a career. In a way this was
almost harder to bear. I went ahead with my preparations for
suicide.


Among her friends, however, was a bachelor whom she
saw occasionally, and who had never appeared to be more
than on the fringe of her life. Suddenly she wrote to him
about her new post. She asked his advice; she hinted that she

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Two months later, just before Easter, when I was actually
making my sober preparations for departure, burning papers
and letters, and packing up my diaries and addressing them to
Helen for disposal, Elizabeth was entertaining this man she
had selected for her husband, and a week later, when I was
in the hospital, they became engaged.


Here was a scene which Thomas Hardy would have relished.
Only he could have done justice to it in one of those tart,
brief ‘unadjusted impressions’ of which he writes in the
preface to one of his volumes of poetry. As I had the story
from her own lips, I have no reason to doubt it, yet must
add the rider that as I am telling the story, it is my truth
not Elizabeth&apos;s.


Her fancy-man (I cannot resist using Hardy&apos;s expression)
had come to London to take her out to lunch before he went
to a meeting. They went for a walk in a park afterwards and
she told him that she was unhappy and perplexed. Her personal
life was at an impasse. She needed to talk to someone
outside the situation. She was not explicit. She did not say
what the predicament was.


His curiosity aroused and his sympathy, the ‘fancy-man’
acquiesced eagerly in the suggestion that he should lunch with
her the following day at her flat. She had longed to ask him to
stay on to dinner that evening, but in keeping with the
Hardyesque irony of the whole situation, it happened that,
some time before, she had invited her amorous old admirer to
come to dinner that night. So she had the chagrin of entertaining
him and enduring his maudlin caresses, while the man
she had decided to love--they are her own words; it was a
deliberate matter on her part--was eating a solitary dinner at
his hotel.


Next day he came to lunch and she told him of her relationship
with me. He was fascinated and wanted to know exactly
what lesbians did with each other in bed. His period in the

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I knew nothing of all this, of course, while I lay in the
nursing home. Elizabeth&apos;s marriage took place in the early
autumn. We met several times before then, and I pieced the
story together from what she told me. She was entirely open
and frank with me. We were indeed oddly at ease with one
another in the few months that remained before her wedding.


Meanwhile, I had discovered just how near to death I had
been, and how much pain I had caused. At first, I was incredulous
when I heard of the rescue by the police, and how
near to disaster it had been; when I learned of my four-day
coma in the hospital. When I had fitted these incidents into the
framework of my attempt at suicide and all I remembered of
that walk on the downs, the reading of <i>The Goshawk</i>, the
sudden descent into unconsciousness, I found it an appalling
burden upon my mind. I had wanted oblivion, and had been
given instead a barren, stony field of memory. I was thankful
to see Helen. I instinctively turned to her, for she had been, in
a sense, involved with the situation.


Helen sensed my despair as soon as she entered the room in
the nursing home. She kissed me, which she had never done
before, and told me that from her own point of view, she
was thankful that I was alive. She accepted without comment
of any kind my often reiterated statement that I bitterly regretted
having been brought to life. Her physical and verbal

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Helen did not mention Elizabeth. She barely expressed
sympathy. She simply sat by the bed and asked me with a
restorative curiosity just how I had done it.


‘You see,’ she said seriously. ‘I very much want to know. I
have known several people who talked about suicide but you&apos;re
the first person I&apos;ve known well who actually tried to do it
and was nearly successful. Tell me what you did. From the beginning.’


I told her willingly. Perhaps it was only to Helen that the
tale could have been told profitably--I mean, to my own
profit--for with Helen I could indulge the one side of myself
that had the capacity and strength to handle such an experience--
my sense of comedy.


It was a release far greater than the mere telling of it to
relieve my mind of a burden. It was at last a chance to involve
myself with my own suicide attempt on a new plane. I was an
almost defunct instrument, and Helen the musician with the
ingenuity and perception to strike the few notes which would
give out a tolerable sound.


I found myself able to tell her the whole tale, including the
policemen&apos;s ludicrous drive to the hospital. I could only speak
with difficulty in a blurred way, because my speech was badly
affected, but she sat and listened and prompted me, and we
both laughed at the comic side of it. Her warmth and her
ironic attitude to life awoke a response in my barely living
heart and restored me, reconciled me a little to the bitter business
of staying alive.


Looking back over the diary of this bitterly unhappy period,
I find it shot through with a kind of private laughter. I suffered
so much, allowed the smallest frustrations and disappointments
to throw me into cold shadow, and all the time I was planning
to leave it all for good. I was able at times to step aside and

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

None the less, even when you have taken such a momentous
decision as this, it does not entirely relieve you of all cares.
The pain you are in still has to be lived through, and <i>in extremis</i>,
you search with exaggerated urgency for the next
handhold, the next ledge or niche for your groping foot.


Both during the long winter before I put my plan into
action, and again after my recovery--the blackest period of my
life--Helen kept a hand stretched towards me. I came to love
her deeply, and to know her well and to discover new facets in
her character that I never suspected, some of which amused
me; so secure did I feel in my affection that I could afford at
last a little amusement. She has a refreshing if sometimes infuriating
selfishness. I say ‘refreshing’ because I really admire
this quality in her and wish I could emulate it. Helen has her
own life to consider and offers me a strong pull over a rough
passage only if she is sure that I shall not drag her off balance
in the process. ‘Infuriating’ because I am like a child in expecting
people to behave as I want them to, and feeling angry
and frustrated when they do not. I know now that I was
demanding and that Helen was right to resist some of my demands,
but at the time I was often hurt and angry at her
resistance.


I think I have a tendency to treat people as though they
were characters in a book. Given a situation in which I am
involved, I imagine that I can reason not with the people concerned
but with the situation itself. I see myself tearing up a
chapter and rewriting it, cursing its intractability, delighted
when it goes as I want it to. I ascribe motives to my friends and
lovers as though they were creatures whom I had created, and
because I regard them like this, it seems quite legitimate to
manipulate them and rearrange them and order their exits
and their entrances. But I have never been able to do this with
Helen, who remains obstinately herself, outside my manipulative
field. The relationship between us is one of love, a certain

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus it was that I was not only able to accept Helen&apos;s
‘ghoulish curiosity’ about my attempted suicide, about the
predicament I was now in and about the future I had to face;
I was able to <i>share</i> it. Like a pair of hooded conspirators
opening secret documents in a cellar, we untied the knots and
handed each other the packeted details, and if she was fascinated,
so was I. I have always been intensely curious about
myself and it is rewarding to share one&apos;s discoveries with an
interested companion. And behind the curiosity she displayed
I was always aware of her warmth.


Helen&apos;s friendship alone, however, would never have sustained
me, nor the love of my friends which was made so
evident to me during the miserable summer of my convalescence,
nor the support of authors like Montaigne, whom
I read constantly at the time. Something entirely personal, and
the most essential part of me was working like yeast in the dull
dough of my despair, my creative impulse. Superficially, I was
little aware of the part it played in my recovery, and over and
over again I denied it with the wicked perversity of every
artist-Peter who has refused to acknowledge his master.


All the winter of 1961 and spring of 1962, I had been
making sporadic notes for a novel. These had often taken a
wry turn, as though at least at one remove I could laugh at the
predicament of love. I was writing enormously in my diary at
that time, covering page after page. I have never expended
myself so prodigally in any other workbook. I wrote as I felt
not merely from day to day but from hour to hour, often interrupting
my normal work to write another page. And half-buried
under endless repetitious outpourings can be found

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hardly anything of the early versions was used. The winter
draft was destroyed when I returned home from the nursing
home. Another version was dictated into a tape recorder during
my convalescence when I could not type or use a pen. This,
too, was almost entirely jettisoned.


But in the end the novel was written and it is, I believe, the
best work I ever wrote. While it was laid aside, I occupied the
desolate winter months of 1962, when Elizabeth had married
and gone, in writing a little book about suicide. I wrote it for
Helen, with whom I knew that I was a little in love. I used
her, with her measured consent, as a substitute for Elizabeth,
with the wry acknowledgement, both to her and my inner self,
that it was all a farce. I deliberately gave myself false hopes in
order to help myself stay alive a little longer, since hope is an
essential ingredient of existence. I thought erotic thoughts
about her; I dreamed of her, but I did not suffer as badly as I
might have done with someone else, because our relative positions
in the game were clearly understood, and I was certain
of her genuine love for me, and that it was strong enough to
contain the feelings I had for her, no matter what they were.


This little book--hardly more than an essay--was a postponement
of the necessity which I sensed was overshadowing
my heart: to write seriously and in depth about my relationship
with Elizabeth. This was the novel which had to be
written, but I was still too close to the subject matter of it. I
paused on the path I knew I had to tread, to sit and discourse
ironically about suicide, and I consoled myself for my loneliness
by writing it privately for someone I loved and who would
appreciate its contents.


This ironic attitude to myself and death was only sustained
with difficulty, but it makes occasional and welcome appearances
in my workbooks, amid the endless pages of pain at the
loss of Elizabeth, despair over my writing, longings for death:

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As a Trio to this Scherzo, I am using a few paragraphs from
this short essay on suicide, written in a style that echoes some
of the seventeenth-century authors whom I enjoy so much, and
whose irony, implicit in the very turns of speech they employ,
I have drawn upon freely. To use a mimic style--to write an
essay of this kind at all--was simply another way of keeping
the novel at bay till I was ready for it. It does not represent my
deepest thoughts upon the subject of suicide, nor even my
present views about it. It is an exercise in survival, which is its
real claim to insertion in this book. It could only have been
written for Helen who knew without being told that it was a
postponement of my death, as well as a deferring of the novel
that had to be written.

<i>General Principles</i>. In general, it would be better if men would
take their own lives, rather than attend upon disease or old
age, or their fellows, to do it for them. We have no choice in
coming into the world, and little choice as to how we live in it.
To be able to select the time and place of our outgoing is an
advantage of which too few avail themselves. It should not be
done heedlessly or rashly.

Self-destruction often appears essential when circumstances
are overwhelmingly hideous or terrifying. Such deaths, the
product of fear, guilt or remorse, can hardly be counted
among the highest class of suicide. There is a want of thought
about them, an outside compulsion, which is distasteful and
removes in part the element of free choice. In fact, I would
even go so far as to say that if death is no more to you than a
way out of an intolerable situation, or an escape from your
own wickedness and its consequences, or from the cruelty of
your fellow-men, you would be better not to kill yourself. For
such things have always been with you, and if you have not
yet learned to endure them, it is time you did. It is an insult to
eloquent, just and mighty death to clutch at him like a coward,
merely because you do not find the common human condition
tolerable.


‘Died for love’ is the theme of numerous lyrics and folk-songs,
and love certainly must be reckoned among the commonest
reasons for suicide. None the less, in youth or middle
age it is a mistake to kill yourself for love. Love affairs should
be regarded as a series of rehearsals. For some, indeed, their
loves will never be anything else. There may come a time,
however, and some men and women recognise it quite clearly,
when the play itself must be enacted. They arrive at an
eventual resting-point in love, which may come early or late
in life.


The breakdown and loss of such a final love, whether
through death or any other case, could be a valid motive for
suicide, which cannot be said of the melancholy hangings
and drownings which fill the ballad books, and whose perpetrators
had, in most cases, mistaken a rehearsal for the
opening night.


Loneliness and depression of mind are well-known causes of
suicide. The bed-sitter suicides form one of the largest groups
and social conditions in our present-day way of life are often
blamed for this. I am not certain that it is fair to blame society
for a condition which is, in fact, so natural. The essential

<i>There is a fearful solitude<br />
Within the careless multitude</i>.


From the beginnings of his social life, man has endeavoured
to make contact with his fellows and deemed it a good thing
to do. It does not detract from the rightness of the attempt to
say that it will, like most ideals, prove unattainable. The error
lies in the assumption that it is somehow <i>unnatural</i> not to
subscribe to a facile belief in ‘togetherness’, that there is,
consequently, something odd and deficient about you if you
suffer from loneliness. This is not the case. You suffer, certainly,
but you suffer not from the thing itself, which is something
you inherit like left-handedness, but from being unable
to accept it and come to terms with it. The first step is to renounce
the trite phrases about men being members one of
another, and no man being an island (though it goes against
the grain to call Donne trite), and then face the fact that each
person is unique in his loneliness. You are at once half-way
towards making those tenuous and fragile communications
with others which, however glancing, however impermanent,
are one of the chief justifications for remaining alive at all.


‘Doors will open and shut,’ wrote Virginia Woolf, who
knew all about the isolated spirit, ‘will keep opening and
shutting, through which I see sights which make me weep.
For they cannot be imparted. Hence our loneliness, hence our
desolation.’


Many a ‘bed-sitter’ suicide, deluded by the feeling that it is
only he himself who is alone, while his fellows are united in
some mysterious and quite mythical brotherhood--a delusion
fostered by the cosy, slap-you-on-the-back intimacy of TV and
the press--takes his life unnecessarily. He could well live to be

In this cruelly conformist century, it is hardly surprising that
many kill themselves not from loneliness, but because they are
different. Perverse and wicked political philosophies, however,
and intolerant and unjust laws are nothing new. Witch-hunting
has always been a popular human sport. To throw out the
runt of the litter is characteristic of animals. Children, who
are very like animals in some ways, hate to be different from
their fellows, and turn against those who will not conform.
From this it can be deduced that the human race as a whole
is in a state of immaturity. What cannot be made to conform,
must be made to feel rejected. The coin of ‘togetherness’ has
the image of Apartheid on its reverse, and Blake&apos;s cry has not
ceased echoing: ‘Oh, why was I born with a different face?’

<i>A serious objection</i>. A serious objection to suicide is to be
found in the melancholy truth that you will not live to enjoy it.
You may spend a lifetime regarding death as your greatest
friend but his terms of friendship are peculiar to himself. There
may well be some who feel that death is a cheat. They would
like to <i>know</i> that they are really dead. Even more, they would
like to see the effect of their death upon friends and relations,
being like those social climbers whose desire to know Lord X
is less a tribute to his charm or merit, than a snobbish desire
to impress others with the degree of their own acquaintanceship
with him. This will not do where death is concerned. You

Beaumont and Fletcher


<i>A time to die</i>. To me there seems to be only one rational
motive for ending one&apos;s life: that it holds for you no further
possibilities, that you have concluded all that you can usefully
do and realise the futility of going on merely because you still
have the ability to breathe. What is the alternative? To wait
for death to catch you unawares? That may, of course, happen
whether you have planned your demise or not, such being the
hazards to which we are subject. To go on living into dotage,
and risk not only that desire will fail, and the windows be
darkened in the streets, but that the will both to make a decision
to die and to carry it into effect may well fail too? If
anyone can view this prospect with equanimity, he must, I
think, be very insensible of the horrors of old age, both for
himself, and for those who must support him and bear with
him.

As to <i>when</i> you should take your life, it is impossible to
advise, for it is of the essence of this matter that you should
assume full responsibility for finding a time most convenient to
yourself and to others. And provided that the idea of suicide
has been accepted, it will not matter greatly if the act is deferred
from year to year or month to month. There may be
good reason for this--to give time for an insurance policy to
mature, for instance, or a mortgage to be paid off, or a child&apos;s
education completed, or more personal reasons, such as seeing
a favourite tree come into flower again, or wearing out an old
pair of walking shoes, or bringing to a conclusion your reading
of the twelve volumes of Proust.


<i>Death hath a thousand doors to let out life.<br />
I shall find one</i>.


Massinger


<i>Method</i>. Before discussing the various methods open to the
would-be suicide, a word of warning must be uttered. Death
is no beautician. Whatever method you choose, you are unlikely
to make a lovely corpse. Bear this in mind when selecting
the place for disposing of yourself and consider who will
find you.


Of the various means commonly in use, some have obvious
advantages over others, but it will depend partly upon taste,
and partly upon accessibility and expense. A rope is cheap, but
hanging is really a business for experts. There is a great danger
that an amateur will not do the job efficiently, and this is a
happy issue for no one concerned. I do not care for poison. It
seems to me foolish to give oneself pain, and most poisons are
peculiarly unpleasant in their effects, even if the effects are
over fairly quickly. Poison is the remedy of the desperate.


Gas is a commonly used method, but it has two disadvantages.
Firstly, it must be obtained through a pipe, and this
implies that the suicide will be committed at home, always a

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sleeping pills are easy to obtain and very efficacious. They
may be taken almost anywhere and are a pleasant form of
suicide, a more <i>natural</i> form, so to speak, since sleep is so
closely related to death, and each day dies with sleep. The
neophyte should remember that they are more effective if
washed down with spirits, such as whisky, and it is also recommended
that a light meal be taken first, as the barbiturates
work better on a full stomach, and are otherwise likely to
produce an unfortunate state of nausea which sometimes
destroys the hopes of the suicide by a fit of vomiting.


Drowning is especially useful to those who wish to spare
their dear ones the knowledge that the death is self-inflicted. It
can be made to look like an accident. But drowning is not an
easy or comfortable method.


Many have cut their throats, an operation not so easily
performed in these days of safety razors, but still possible to
the sure-handed and determined, as is also slashing of the
wrists. These rather dramatic methods suit fiery temperaments,
but are less likely to appeal to the more thoughtful, who having
prepared for their end over a long period, may prefer
the quietus of the long sleep or the shallow stream. The old
Roman way of opening the veins while seated in a warm bath,
and carrying on a philosophical conversation, demands a very
Stoic outlook, and a high degree of staying power, in both
perpetrator and onlooker. It is regrettably slow.


Finally, there is the best method of all, but one, alas, difficult
to come by today, especially for women--shooting. Few of us
can obtain a pistol easily, and a gun may merely lead to nasty
accidents. If only pistols were cheaper, or could be obtained
on hire (payment in advance), death would be a much easier
business for us all.


In conclusion of the matter, to those who remain obtusely

<i>SCHERZO: DA CAPO</i>


I think with affection and admiration of the calm and unshockable
faces of policemen. Suicides Anonymous may do a
very good job for all I know but I myself would never, <i>in
extremis</i>, get in touch with them. The fact that the would-be
suicide must take the first step in communicating with Suicides
Anonymous at once casts a doubt on the integrity of his intentions.
But I can imagine that what might deter me on the
brink of another attempt might be the rock-like chest of a
policeman, that guarantee that I have still some solid standard
of normalcy against which to react. It would be hopeless to
invite me to join a group of would-be suicides. I am not group-minded.
But I can believe that, as I stood on a bridge at midnight
like the poor girl in the ballad, I might be affected by
the phlegmatic tones of a policeman, saying: ‘Come, come.
You don&apos;t want to do that there &apos;ere.’


Probably the firm arm of the law would then guide me to
the police station and give me a cup of tea, a drink I detest.
But how preferable this is to sympathy. How fortified I should

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Consider the disastrous result of sapping sympathy, of
probing, of enquiring, of the demand that I should think of
this or of that--those who love me, my career, my writing. Ill-prepared,
my defence in ruins, I should almost certainly rush
out impulsively against these well-wishers, like a Trojan
against the crafty Greeks, and before I knew where I was,
their wooden horse of psychiatric treatment would have rolled
within my walls and my mind would no longer be my own. I
can think of nothing more calculated to make me kill myself.


In the nursing home, pressure was brought to bear on me
that I should go to a psychiatrist. I had enough strength to
resist, and thus I was able to return to my inner solitude and
begin thoughtfully and slowly to rebuild my ruined stones,
one by one.


I had to consider how I was to live. Although I had set myself
a time limit and was intending to kill myself at the end of
it, I was sufficiently open-minded and curious about the business
of living to take out a kind of insurance policy against it
--you might call it a death insurance--in case, when the time
came, I lacked either the desire or the will to end my life. I
considered first, how I was to strengthen my mind for total
inner solitude and store this solitude like a private study
with pleasures which I could enjoy and exploit alone; second,
how to preserve and deepen friendship with the three or four
people whom I loved, for I could not exist without emotional
warmth, without the freedom to love and the security of being
loved.


I began to see more of some of my friends than I had done
for some time. I became selective, even ruthless. I rid myself
of acquaintances, but resuscitated some friendships which I felt
I had neglected. I realised that in some cases I had been too
easily entertained or gratified or nattered or even imposed

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was much that I knew I had to pare away from my
life and it was by no means all dead wood. When I consider the
unhappiness of this time, the violent attacks of pain and the
difficulty I had in keeping my resolve to remain alive even for
the first twelve months, I marvel at my craftsmanship, seeing
myself like someone who whittles away at a stick, cutting and
shaping and smoothing, only with the intention of tossing it
into a ditch when it is done.


This paring away of so much has left me leaner, sharper,
pliable but tough. It has helped me to weigh up with my
mental and physical sensibilities what I love, what I need,
what I possess in myself, what I can give to others.


I have a desire which was not present with me when I was
young, to wrest out of what I find in life the last ounce of
happiness that it will yield. Now I teach myself, painfully at
times, to accept, in the hope and belief that there is something
of value in what I accept. Or a belief that I must act as my
own sorcerer and transmute what I find. I cultivate distaste
for throwing anything away until it has been raked over and
examined down to the last handful for possible treasure. This
attitude could be termed in its ideal form, the form to be
striven for, ‘detached curiosity’ or ‘critical acceptance’.


Outside the window, my eyes rest on the most extraordinary
April scene. Green hills streaked with long drifts of
snow deeply piled against every east-facing hedge; a blackthorn
winter that is one of the severest in memory hereabouts.
The birds are perplexed and I am continually distracted from
my typewriter by their antics on the terrace outside as they
search for food. Like stout Cortez, an adventurous greenfinch
in chrome and olive livery perches upon a coconut hitherto
sacred to the tits and peers into a strange white basin. He has
had a job to perch on it. Neither his claws nor his beak is
adapted for a coconut, but he has made a discovery. Others,

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

How evasive one&apos;s thoughts are, carried like random
branches on the stream of deeper consciousness. The whole of
this scherzo eddies round my relationship with Helen. It is as it
were in the key and rhythm of this relationship. It started off
with a nice flourish of policemen; then modulated its key for
the different devices I used in my private war of survival: the
abortive novel, the unrealised affair with a beautiful Celt, the
books I was reading. Now it is back in Helen&apos;s key again. And
the form--a scherzo? Because life is a joke and Helen is the
only person with whom I have ever been able fully to share
the joke. A scherzo, because even my feelings for her have a
comic side to them, and it is better to laugh than make a
tragedy of them. I did do this for a while when the struggle to
stay alive was very hard. I needed to secure myself to life even
temporarily, and falling in love with Helen gave me some sort
of anchorage. I was for a time incapable of seeing the ludicrousness
of the situation. It speaks volumes for Helen&apos;s
affection that she put up with me and did not shut the door
in my face for good.


I know that I idealise her. This is necessary. It is really a
protection from myself that I offer her. Since I knew that
she would never accept more than a part of the love I came to
feel for her, I deliberately put her at one remove by idealisation,
by setting her up as the ‘impossible she’. Because this is
openly acknowledged between us, we can regard it ironically,
and it has become less important as I have known myself so
deeply loved.


Certain qualities in me require to be nourished in the light
of a certain particular relationship, as a plant needs a certain
climate or temperature if it is to flower. The ironic side of me

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perhaps the greatest tribute I can pay to my relationship
with Helen is that I--no, that both of us--feel we have
created it and can view it from outside as a thing-in-itself. We
are not uncomfortably involved with each other. What we
have, we enjoy and approach with appreciative detachment.
It is like a glass of Mr. Weston&apos;s good wine. This is very rare
indeed and I have never found it in any other relationship to
the same degree.


That I find her sexually attractive does not perturb her or
embarrass me. I can and do laugh a little at the expressions of
this, at the impulse I have to court her mildly with occasional
presents of books or flowers. But she accepts these with
pleasure and they are relieved of the pain that might otherwise
accompany them, since I know that on her own candid
terms, the love is returned. She has done much for me, and in
the trouble which has come into her own life I hope I have
done something to repay the debt.


With Helen I enjoy a climate of understanding. This is not
due to any Socratic questioning on her part, or any attempt to
explain me to myself. She has never tried to destroy my
illusions, to ‘make me face reality’ (detestable practice) nor
doubted the magnitude of the loss I suffered in Elizabeth.
Like a wily chancellor in the confidence of an absolutist
monarch, she has aided and abetted my curiosity, my self-acquisitiveness,
and thus brought me or certainly accompanied

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697845-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What I have reached both in myself and with Helen is a
state that must continually be made to reveal its meaning, to
unfold, to flower, to manifest its relevance to our different ways
of life. Merely to state that the relationship exists and is such
and such is no more than a statement that a rose is a rose is a
rose. Grace in the religious sense is to be looked for: the grace
that makes live the dry bones of mere knowledge, that goes
beyond the revelation to the growing, living experience and
embraces it. It should be celebrated in poetry or music, for the
very word ‘grace’ goes back to ‘gir’, a song of praise. Were I a
poet, I would gladly celebrate Helen in verse. As it is, I offer
her the scherzo with my love, and Alyse Gregory, to whom
the book is dedicated, would not have begrudged it to her.
