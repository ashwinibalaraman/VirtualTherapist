BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: So is that a recorder without the little attachment?
THERAPIST: Yeah. With the newer ones they put in better microphones.
CLIENT: Oh good. (Pause) So I find I'm really really uncomfortable with the idea that I'm trying to get you to fill specific roles.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: (Pause) Rationally I know that that's kind of what we do with every in our lives, but I really don't like that idea. (Pause) I felt really bad about calling you last night.
THERAPIST: Oh? [00:00:57]
CLIENT: (Pause) I've (pause) Yeah I just (pause) you have your own life and I don't like taking you away from it. (Pause, crying) I can't get over that, or have not been able to. (Pause, exhales)
THERAPIST: I mean the three things you're saying, the furniture, the perfections, and the phone call. (Pause) It sounds like (pause) you're really feeling bad about what you're doing or might do to me and I suspect more so even than feeling bad about it I think you're probably really scared. [00:02:25]
CLIENT: (Pause, crying) Maybe. (Pause) I don't (pause), yeah I mean I don't want to hurt you. And (pause) I don't want you to put yourself in a place where I can hurt you, if that makes sense. I realize that you probably have to but that's really scary for me. (Pause) Yeah (pause) and I don't like to think of myself as someone who pushes other people into being what I want them to be. I really don't, I don't like it when other people do that to me but I'm a sucker for it so (chuckles) I just don't want to be that person. (Pause, crying). [00:04:10] I don't like to hurt people (pause) I don't have anything else to say about that.
THERAPIST: Are there (pause) particular ways you're concerned about hurting me? Or that you have in mind, I don't know make myself vulnerable to being hurt?
CLIENT: Really it's just I could not do your job. I could not be a therapist. I don't know how you do it. (Pause) And (pause) but I try to take care of the people in my life and be there for them and listen to them and that takes so much out of me I don't know how you do this every day and don't get home completely fried all the time. [00:05:38] And I don't want to add to that.
(Pause, crying) You know it's really important for me to have places and times where I can be secure and know that I don't have to deal with anything and I don't feel comfortable with the idea that you can't have that or that you don't have that. (Pause, crying) But then it goes back into the you are not me; the things that you need are not the things that I need. And so I just have to trust that you can take care of yourself, but I'm not good at doing that (pause, laughs, crying). [00:07:08]
THERAPIST: Yeah or I guess (pause) it doesn't really feel like you're not taking care of me, or are doing something you worry will be the opposite?
CLIENT: More the second. (Pause) Yeah. (Pause, crying). I called James just before I got here to talk to him about the apartment and (inaudible at 00:07:56) deposit and whether I have to take it or not and so forth. Did I tell you I went to the apartment this morning?
THERAPIST: No. [00:08:02]
CLIENT: Oh ok, yeah I went to the apartment this morning. I'd be living with men which is about the same for me as living with women, just stressful in different ways.
THERAPIST: I get it, like unbalanced similar but different.
CLIENT: Yeah. And obviously it depends on the people. (Pause) So I just said, you know, I don't think I was very nice to you last night, I'm really sorry. He said okay. (Pause) He said he wasn't upset he was just, you know, concerned that I wasn't doing very well, but he just really didn't want to talk about it, which is fine. (Pause) Probably he did not want to be party to me beating myself up about something. [00:09:03]
(Pause, clears throat) I just feel like I'm so distracted. (Pause) And I don't like thinking that the people who are in my life are worse off because of it. But I can't help thinking that. (Pause) And (pause) I feel like I don't have much to give right now. (Crying) And it makes it hard for me to take things from people, you know. [00:10:06]
(Pause, crying) So I've been thinking about how to ask, it's hard for me to describe the character of the sadness for me. And I think at least part of it is I just, I feel like there's not way I'm going to be able to do the things that I need to do. I just know that I'm going to fail all of them. (Pause) And every day goes by that I don't utterly ruin my life I think, but that's about as good as I can do. I can't (sighs) yeah so. [00:11:24]
(Pause) I guess I was going to change the subject. (Pause) I just feel like it's only a matter of time before, you know (pause) I don't know what, (pause) I do some real damage.
THERAPIST: To yourself or to someone else? [00:12:32]
CLIENT: No (pause, crying). TBryan you. Whether by directly damaging them or by completely failing the trust of people. (Pause) And I've got these really really good things in my life, these really good people and this great opportunity for a career possibly maybe somewhere in the future and I could be getting paid to do my favorite thing. (Pause) Any you know I'm going to fuck it up. And not just in the ways that everybody messes up at periodic times, just like I'm going to ruin everything. [00:14:02] (Pause, crying) It's just a matter of time. (Pause, cyring) Is that what they call paranoia? (Pause) Okay (laughs).
THERAPIST: No. What made you liken it to paranoia?
CLIENT: Oh just that it's (pause) the completely irrational fear that, or conviction that something is out to get me, except in my case I'm out to get myself (pause, both laugh). [00:15:12]
THERAPIST: I (pause) I wonder if you're warning me. I'm aware that you are prognosticating about yourself, but (pause) I guess I also imagine you might be (pause) warning me that you're not going to get better, that, I don't know, in various ways you're going to be sort of demanding or difficult for me?
CLIENT: I guess I just want you to know that if I don't get better it's not going to be your fault.
THERAPIST: I see. (Pause) You really wouldn't want me to feel bad or ineffective or like I'm fucking up?
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:16:28]
THERAPIST: In case you don't get better.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Yeah I don't want you to be another person who puts your trust in me because I'm not going to be able to do it.
THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause, client crying) You're going to blow it? [00:17:13]
CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah. (Pause, sighs) And I also thought about paranoia because there was an episode of Bones that I was watching the other day in which one of the suspects, was a person who had a mental illness like bi-polar and cyclothymia (sp?) with paranoia. Whoa and they let him out of the mental institution? I was like, seriously guys (both laugh)! Look this shit up!
THERAPIST: Right. [00:18:19]
CLIENT: I guess if (inaudible at 00:18:25) that would be boring? That's why you should not watch that show (both laugh). It will drive you insane. It drove me insane and I don't actually know anything about psychology.
THERAPIST: Right, right.
CLIENT: (Pause, laughs) Yeah I've become a lot more sensitive to that kind of thing.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And when I was at the hospital with Kirsten she asked to see a chaplain, it was a Catholic hospital and she was a Catholic. They didn't have a priest on duty so they sent one of the chaplain interns in and it turned out she was a woman a year younger than I am who is getting her M. Div (sp?), not at the college but at the, ...what is the abbreviation, I don't know. Anyway, someplace affiliated with the college. So it was funny, Kirsten didn't know her but she knew all her friends and all her husband's too. And she's really a nice girl (pause, signs) mediocre in her effectiveness, but. [00:19:56] And she didn't have much to do so she just kind of sat and we talked for a while, I think that was really good. And I had been describing having been on a psych ward and how frustrating it was to me when nurses treated me like I was a child or like I was mentally deficient in some way or just not a person, you know. And she said "yeah but I mean, you know they're probably really used to dealing with cases where people are just much more lower functioning, are much sicker and so it makes sense". And I was like NO!!!! (laughs) That's the opposite of my point!
THERAPIST: Right, yeah.
CLIENT: They're all still people (laughs). [00:21:04]
THERAPIST: (Pause) Yeah I remember, I mean, on the other end of things during my training and they used to do this more when I was in training a little bit, they would have interviews in front of an audience so they'd have a senior clinical person and a patient doing some sort of initial or diagnostic interview or something like that and they had residents or interns or whoever watching. They used to do it more, they don't do it that much these days, but—
CLIENT: Oh that's good (laughs).
THERAPIST: Yeah. It was remarkable though you'd see some patients come in who were, you know, people in their forties with acute <span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;"><a href="#hitlist" style="padding-right:2px;"><img alt="Previous Hit" border="0" src="psyc.graphics/prevhit.gif" /></a><a name="schizophrenia0"></a><span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">schizophrenia</span></span> or something quite severe who, you know, looked weird and who just clearly hadn't functioned well in a long time and talked in very idiosyncratic ways (inaudible at 00:22:08), and it was very impressive to see the clients who sit down with them and immediately be so comfortable and easy and sort of (pause) it was easy to imagine somebody sitting down and saying like, well I don't know what to say, and they would just sit down kind of right there with the person in a very nice, easy, sort of connected way. [00:22:37]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Sort of the opposite of what you're talking about.
CLIENT: Yeah. I scolded one of the training nurses (laughs). She asked me a question that was basically like, well have you ever considered? And I don't remember what she asked but it was something very, very basic.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Like have you ever—
THERAPIST: Like 'have you ever considered tying your shoes?'
CLIENT: Yeah. Like 'have you ever considered that maybe you have issues because your parents got divorced?' Like something on that level. And I was just like, look, you're being incredibly condescending in your manner and your tone and if you're going to be a nurse you can't afford to do that. (Both laugh) She went away freaking mad.
THERAPIST: I guess not.
CLIENT: I feel like I did some good (both laugh).
THERAPIST: I think you enjoyed it a little bit too.
CLIENT: Oh yes (both laugh). I'd been talking to training nurses every day for a week, I felt like—
THERAPIST: About time. [00:23:40]
CLIENT: Yeah. And hopefully it's helpful. I don't know if it's really going to sink in for her but— (Pause) So yeah I'm rallying, that's where I am. And you?
THERAPIST: (Pause) This may be totally irrelevant but (pause) do you worry about how I would treat the parts of you that feel crazy?
CLIENT: No. (Pause) At least I'm not aware of it.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: No I trust you.
THERAPIST: Okay. [00:24:38]
CLIENT: And I mean, you said that you work with kids?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And that's a very different thing, but I also can picture you being very good with kids. I don't know, I trust you (inaudible at 00:24:56).
THERAPIST: I don't have the sense so much that this is an issue either, I also probably look a bit younger than I am. Is that a concern?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: No, you're clearly competent. It doesn't matter.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I have no idea how old you are, but—
THERAPIST: Seventy-five.
CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). Yeah that was kind of a (inaudible at 00:25:43). Damn (both laugh)! No that's not a concern.
THERAPIST: Okay. [00:25:51]
CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah, I mean I've worked with enough people to find that age doesn't really have anything to do with how sensitive a person is or like a fit for me or whatever. Because I've also found that people who drive me up the wall are the people I really love so I have to, you know, just because you don't get along with this person doesn't mean they aren't competent. Except for a couple of people who are clearly incompetent (both laugh). You know it doesn't— (Pause) Yeah, I mean I'm not worried that you are going to fail me I'm worried that I am going to fail you. (Pause) Yeah. [00:26:54]
THERAPIST: (Pause) You actually, at the moment, sound pretty sure of that.
CLIENT: Yes. That was what I said.
THERAPIST: (Pause) Although it also sounds like a lot of what you're concerned about is (pause) that, not so much for your own sake, but for mine, like how it would affect me. In other words, I think you're concerned about yourself clearly, but—
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think a lot of what you're saying is that you're concerned about how I would feel at fault or I would feel, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, although (pause) the voice of reason is fairly strong still but I still, you know, I feel that and then I say to myself 'no, this is your job'. You're good at it, you know how to deal with it, it'll be okay. (Pause) Yeah. [00:28:14] I worry about depending on you too much. You know, you are the person that I see most often now at this point. You know my mom talks about her relationship with her psychologist and in some ways that's really good for her and in some ways I think it's really sad because she can't really have real relationships. And not that this is not a real relationship but it's not
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: a full relationship. And (pause) you know it's not just because I don't want to be my mother, although that's clearly there. But I don't (pause), you know it's in the nature of things that this relationship means more to me than it does to you. And I'm okay with that, but I don't (pause) I don't want this to substitute for the rest of my life. (Pause) And I'm starting to think that. [00:29:49]
(Pause) You know it was really weird to talk with James for an hour and then he said 'I don't think I can help you, you should call Chad' and then calling you, that's weird! (Laughs)
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Umm.
THERAPIST: He's your husband.
CLIENT: I'm sorry?
THERAPIST: He's your husband.
CLIENT: Exactly.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) But I mean, we are having a hard time being close right now or I feel like we are. And it's (clears throat), I feel like it's hard for me to be who I am around him because I've been a fucking mess and he's in a good place with his work right now and I really want him to stay that way, I really, yeah. It's really nice to talk to him and have him be excited about the reaction that he got that day and I say 'oh well what is this reaction?' and he actually gives me the science part of it, although if he's stop to think about it he would know that I am completely not following him. (Laughs) And that's really cool, I like that. But it's also distancing because, you know, I'm just running the same sad loop and he's not, I can't give that to him or if I do he can't do anything about it. Yeah, that's kind of the mood killer. [00:32:06]
THERAPIST: (Pause) Yeah I mean, (pause) I think as far as one way, I'm thinking about what you're describing is (pause) sometimes in certain parts of psychology (inaudible at 00:33:09) have models or sort of relationships as kind of internal or psychological aspects of who it is as kind of like objects, you know like (pause). I guess I keep thinking of the way that you feel like your objects are quite vulnerable and quite weak and very much in danger from you.
CLIENT: I'm sorry, I spaced out in the middle of the first part where you were explaining (overlapping laughter, inaudible at 00:34:06). Can you just repeat exactly what you said?
THERAPIST: Sure, sure. There's probably a—
CLIENT: This happens with all the times if (laughs).
THERAPIST: What I'm saying is you (pause) I think experience, anticipate that, imagine that the people you're close to are certainly quite weak and vulnerable in certain ways, particularly to you and your emotional life, especially your depression. And there's a lot I don't know about the story but I'm sure you had moments of that when you were a kid. What you were saying earlier, you're really worried about me being busy and fried at the end of the day and not having time to myself, I know you were referring to what you feel you need. I certainly remember things you said about your dad as well. [00:35:16]
(Pause) And (pause) I guess I'm not entirely sure as I continue to talk about this where I'm going with it, but I started thinking about it in terms of you and James and the way that you (pause) feel more distant from him when can't or don't want to talk more with him about how you're feeling bad, at the same time you think that's not a good idea. [00:36:09]
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I called him last night because I was feeling bad and I thought, no I need to (pause) I need James to be a part of this. Or I need him to know what's going on with me? Or, you know I don't know, I need him to be with me in this? And it was kind of a disaster. (Pause) Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it did not feel like a disaster when we talked on the phone?
CLIENT: No. I didn't feel much better, but I felt a little better. And you're not my husband (laughs). I'm not worried that I'm going to upset you in the same way that I'm worried that I'm going to upset James. (Pause) And certainly the only person that I was with before James, my high school boyfriend Bryan was incredibly vulnerable in that way always.
THERAPIST: Yep. [00:37:28]
CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah I don't know where the line is between (pause), I don't know how to not wear people out. I don't know how far people will go for me, how far people can go for me. I don't know how far it's fair to ask them. Seems like a waste if (pause) I mean, it doesn't make much of a difference what people do at least I feel like it doesn't. It probably does but I feel like it doesn't. (Pause) They really just shouldn't bother. [00:38:54]
THERAPIST: Yeah I agree, I think it does make a difference.
CLIENT: (Pause) I don't know. (Pause) It does sometimes, but not always and it doesn't stick.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah and I feel like a leech. [00:39:47]
THERAPIST: (Pause) I, umm (pause) imagine that a hard part of this to, sort of, own or be in touch with is (pause) is the part where, I guess in reference to last night, I think it does feel like James is failing you. I know that
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: you feel lots of other ways too about it, but—
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:40:49]
THERAPIST: (Pause) I guess I think that part is important partially because (pause) it has something to do with what you want which isn't so clear.
CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah.
THERAPIST: I guess I imagine you did want something from him last night that he was not giving you and it's not clear what that was in that you told me that listening at times is sort of just listening and he had suggestions that in some ways seemed off the wall.
CLIENT: I guess what I want is for us still to be close and on the same page when I am sad. I never feel like we are. You know? And we talk about it a lot and I kind of got the he doesn't always need to fix me, sometimes just listening is good and that kind of thing, but I never feel like we're together when I am sad. I don't know why. [00:42:49]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I think in some ways what I want from his is just so alien to him. (Pause) And so, in some ways whether I try to kind of just shut it down and be with him where he is or whether I try to bring him in to where I'm feeling I don't, it doesn't, I mean it's really hard to describe the difference between being on the same page with somebody and not being there when you're, you know, intimate with them and in a close relationship. You know sometimes you're just with each other and sometimes you're not and you can be saying almost exactly the same things.
THERAPIST: It has much more to do with the feel of it I think.
CLIENT: Yeah and that's kind of the way it is, like for James and I we're just, usually, most of the time we're just right there in lock step even when we're fighting. Often not when we're fighting but sometimes when we are fighting. And the point, when we have fights, the point at which things start to get better, not the point when we solve the problems, but when we get on the same page and then it's only a matter of time before we solve the problem. [00:44:10] And it takes however long it takes but we're still there. And it doesn't have anything to do with how we feel about each other or whether we agree on something, it's just (pause), I don't know, just being on the same page. That's why I feel like it's just, it's alienating me from him and I don't know how to get it back. And you know, to some extent, the same kind of thing happens with other people, but the difference is James is the person that I'm closest with in the first place, but James is also one of the only people that I'm very very close with that really has no idea what this is like. You know?
THERAPIST: Yeah. We should stop for now but I'll see you on Monday.
CLIENT: No, not next week but the week after next I won't be here on Monday.
THERAPIST: Oh okay.
CLIENT: I'm going to go out of town from Saturday until Tuesday.
THERAPIST: Okay. We'll have to reschedule. It might be easier for me to do that when we meet this Monday.
CLIENT: Okay.
