Two WEEKS later I got a job as a copy editor for a small
investment magazine down on Wall Street. I had answered
an ad in the <i>Times</i>, and though I wasn&apos;t feeling well that
day, the interview went off well. It was a good job of acting,
I must confess. I smiled punctually, nodded punctually
and lied punctually.


The job didn&apos;t seem too demanding and I liked the
people I was to work with; most of all, it would keep me
occupied and my mind off myself. But I had serious doubts
that I could hold it in my condition. Every day, I knew,
would be a struggle against my symptoms until, finally,
they would disappear as magically as they had come. Or so
I had been told by the psychoanalysts.


But they didn&apos;t disappear. Instead, as the days
passed, they began to multiply and strike with greater
force. Again the inexplicable cycle appeared: for days tension
would build up until it was unbearable, followed by
attacks of nervous anxiety and then days of crippling
fatigue. I was on the roller-coaster again--up and down,
down and up. My jaw tic reappeared and it was joined by
an eye-lid tic. Again the tiny pimples reappeared on my

Each day, on the job, I fought to hide these symptoms
from my boss and the other employees. When an anxiety
attack struck, I would go to the bathroom, sit on a commode
and cry until it subsided. Or, I would excuse myself,
saying that I needed a cup of coffee, and walk--almost run
--for a few miles until the attack subsided. The attacks,
strangely, very often came shortly after lunch time and a
few hours after dinner time. Life no longer held any
pleasure; all I could hope for was a few hours reprieve
from my symptoms.


For a couple of months I managed to continue to live
in this private hell and still function somewhat adequately
on the job. But every day I lived in terror of a relapse. The
signs were there, all the symptoms that I had experienced
before my breakdown. I still craved exercise and sometimes,
on weekends, I&apos;d play basketball with the Puerto
Rican kids on the playground near my brownstone.


One working day, around noon, I was lunching by myself
in a cafeteria on Maiden Lane when suddenly I felt
a familiar sensation. My mind abruptly became disoriented
and a feeling of terror overwhelmed me. Beads of sweat
trickled down my forehead, and I was on the edge of losing
all control. I was going berserk. I couldn&apos;t finish the
hamburger I was eating. Shaking all over, I got to my feet
and almost fainted. Where was I? I didn&apos;t know. Got to
run ... got to run ... run ... run ... run....


I walked quickly out of the cafeteria and in a minute
was lost in the lunch-hour crowds on Broadway. I had no

My apartment was dark and gloomy and I hated the
sight of it. For an hour I paced the floor like a caged
animal, sometimes throwing myself on the bed and sobbing
fitfully, my mind racing in circles. Then I made the
decision. Slowly, purposefully, I got off the bed and went
to my desk. Slowly, deliberately, I scrawled out a simple
note saying good-bye to my folks and Laurie and leaving
all my meager belongings to my wife. Slowly, I opened the
window of the apartment and climbed out onto the fire
escape.


The sun was shining brightly. My eyes were fixed on
the pavement eight floors below. In a minute it would all
be over and I&apos;d be nothing but a small headline in <i>The
Daily News</i>. Something inside me kept saying: Jump,
jump, jump! You can&apos;t fight it any longer. Jump! No man
should be expected to endure this much. You&apos;re licked. No
one could have fought the illness harder than you fought
it. Neither love nor will power nor intellectual insight nor
psychotherapy, nor drugs, nor shock, had made any difference.
Nothing made any difference. You&apos;ve had more than
your share of happiness for thirty years. Now it&apos;s all over.
Jump!

My hands clenched the railing and all my muscles
tightened. Somewhere I heard a distant voice singing a
familiar song. "I&apos;ve got the world on a string...." I thought
I was having a hallucination but the voice was coming
from an apartment in the courtyard below. "...sitting on a
rainbow...." It was a sweet, cheerful feminine voice. "...
got the string around my finger-r-r-r-r..." I remembered
Laurie and myself singing that song while driving up the
Hudson on a beautiful fall day three years ago. "...what a
world! ...what a life! I&apos;m in love...."


Trembling, I drew back. How good it had been to be
healthy and alive and in love. I picked up the phone and
called the office. I was ill, I explained, and had had to come
home, but I&apos;d be back tomorrow. Then I called the sanitarium
and requested that I be given some drugs. They recommended
that I see another psychiatrist on the outside
that very day. A Dr. Smith.


Dr. Smith&apos;s office was located in the Village. He was a
young, very pleasant man with an Ivy-League haircut and
a southern accent, which sounded like Tidewater Virginian.
More of a brother-figure than a father-figure. We
got along nicely. He had read, he said, all my records at
the sanitarium. I explained what had happened and he
nodded sympathetically.


"Should I go back to the sanitarium?" I asked.


"I wouldn&apos;t recommend it," he said. "Let&apos;s try and
work it out here."


"What the hell&apos;s wrong with me, doc?" I asked, a
question I had asked a hundred times of psychiatrists.
"When will these damn symptoms go away?"

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00192&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I don&apos;t know," he said. At least it was an honest
answer. "There are three categories of patients. A third get
entirely well without treatment. A third get entirely well
with treatment. And a third get partially well with treatment,
but their illness appears to be cyclical.... Yours may
be cyclical."


"Good God!" I said, "you mean I may be doomed to
spending the rest of my life in and out of institutions?"


"I don&apos;t know," he said. "These things are unpredictable."


Unlike the others, he had been refreshingly honest
with me, but now I didn&apos;t appreciate his honesty.


"What the hell is the point of living under these conditions?"
I said. He said nothing.


Instead he prescribed some tranquilizers (to calm me
down) and some anti-depressants (to pep me up) and insisted
that I undergo psychotherapy with him twice a
week.


"You know I don&apos;t believe in it," I said.


"I know."


I agreed to give it another try. Maybe the drugs
would help.


The next day I took the drugs faithfully and returned
to the job. The drugs seemed to help some, relieving but
not eliminating the symptoms. And in the following few
weeks I faithfully underwent psychotherapy with Dr.
Smith. We established a fine rapport and I took a great
liking to him, perhaps because, unlike the others, he was
unpretentious, straightforward and aware of the limitations
of psychiatry. Still, he was very much Freudian oriented,

"When do they usually occur?"


"Mostly after lunch time."


"That&apos;s strange," he said. "Who is in the office with
you before you go to lunch?"


"My boss, another editor and a secretary."


"Do you like them?"


"Sure. I get along fine with them."


"Is your boss demanding? Does he pick on you?"


"No, he&apos;s easy going. Look," I said, "I like the job and
the people I work with are okay. It dosen&apos;t make sense.
The attacks, they&apos;re sort of like a day-time nightmare."


"Hmmmmmmmmh," he meditated. "It&apos;s apparent that
something deep-rooted in your subconscious is trying to
force its way to the surface."


"But what?" I cried, exasperated. "Look, I&apos;ll admit anything,
anything you want me to admit about myself, and
I&apos;ll invent things if that will help."


"You still think it&apos;s physical?" he said.


"I&apos;ll never think otherwise," I said. "It&apos;s not a matter
of what I think but how I <i>feel</i>."


"You&apos;ll have to learn how to live with your symptoms,"
he said.


"I don&apos;t want to live them," I said, annoyed. "How
the hell do you live with insanity?"


In such ways did we pass the time. Meanwhile, on the
job, I realized that I wasn&apos;t the only one who was having

One morning, I arrived early at the office and, sitting
at my desk, began to scan <i>The New York Herald Tribune</i>.
My attention settled on a story in one of the inside pages:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Protein May Be Key</i>
</p>
<p>
SCHIZOPHRENIA A BIOLOGICAL DISEASE?
</p>
</blockquote>


<i>Protein May Be Key</i>


SCHIZOPHRENIA A BIOLOGICAL DISEASE?


My eyes devoured the article. A group of biochemists,
the article reported, had succeeded in extracting from the

[p. <i>195</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Jacques Gottlieb, director, and Dr. Charles Froh-man,
biochemist, of the Lafayette Clinic, Detroit, had
confirmed earlier experiments of Dr. Robert G. Heath,
chairman of the Department of Psychiatry &amp; Neurology at
Tulane University. <i>Less than a millionth of an ounce of the
extract seems to be potent</i>, Dr. Gottlieb was said to have
commented.


The article went on to recount the earlier experiments
of Dr. Heath, who discovered the substance in 1956 and
named it "taraxein." When Dr. Heath first tested it on
monkeys, "most profound behavioral changes resulted."
"The behavior resembled very closely that seen in schizophrenic
patients," he reported. "The monkeys appeared
dazed and out of contact. They were catatonic and the
extremeties could be readily molded into various positions."
When he administered taraxein to normal human
volunteers (in as little quantities as 1 to 3 ml.) all of them
"fell into the diagnostic category of psychopathic personality."
Some of the subjects developed paranoid symptoms
--referential ideas, suspicion and auditory hallucinations.
Others, given larger doses, developed full-blown hebephrenic
and catatonic stupor symptoms. The reactions
varied according to the size of the dose. In some volunteers,
the only symptoms were a "lessening in facial animation,
depersonalization, blocking and thought deprivation,"

Dr. Heath had concluded: "We consider schizophrenia
to be a genetically determined metabolic disease." He also
challenged the psychotherapist&apos;s traditional distinguishing
between neurosis and psychosis. "Differences between
schizophrenia and neurosis are quantitative," he pointed
out. "A careful screening for symptoms of this disorder
reveals that the overwhelming majority of patients reporting
to the psychiatrist for treatment are probably suffering
to some degree from this disease."


"Schizophrenia," Dr. Heath emphasized, "is an extremely
widespread disease." And he warned: "It is of the
utmost importance to recognize early the presence of the
disease," because the therapist who doesn&apos;t "may undertake
a type of psychotherapy that can result in dire consequences."


Before I had finished the article the lines seemed to
blur and my eyes filled with tears and I heard myself
laughing. Then, slowly, I removed a razor blade from my
desk drawer and with it, very gently, made a small cut on
my finger. A few drops of blood--dirty, rotten, stinking
blood--trickled down and fell onto the desk-top, and for a
long time I sat there, transfixed, staring at the blood with
what must have been the eyes of a man possessed by a
demon.
