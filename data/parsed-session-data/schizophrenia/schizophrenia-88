BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Gas lines or something?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, like high pressure gas lines you know and stuff like that and they have to be right on it.  You can't have any problems with them.
<b>CG:</b> That's without the gas in them, [LAUGHING], that's before the gas line got [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Well that's why because there's going to be a lot of pressure going in there and they don't want it to last just a couple of days.  They want it to last -
<b>CG:</b> Forever.
<b>PT:</b> Forever -
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know.
<b>DR:</b> Which doesn't exist?
<b>PT:</b> No, no but as long, as long as nature will let it.  They don't want a human error, they want a natural error.  They would rather have nature take its course on it then a human do a bad job and have a pipe blow out and kill somebody.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I'm sure there's all kinds of horror stories that you're going to hear in your training about that.
<b>PT:</b> I'm sure.  Um, they -
<b>DR:</b> So what you're doing is pretty technical isn't it, I mean you must be getting in to a lot of [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> No not necessarily.  It's just got to be like they have certain specifications, like the, the cap to the weld can't be like higher than this above the pipe and uh, the inside can't, can't be sunk back in.  It can't be any under cut where, where you're weld is broken on the wall the edges of your weld can't be, it can't be more then this far penetrated in the pipe, you know.  They're picky, but they have their reasons.  So, you got oil going through that pipe -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Like you don't want stuff to get stuck there where you penetrated through and eventually create a clog.  So they want -
<b>DR:</b> You have to know your, which metals.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] they want like a 16th or less on the inside of that pipe.
<b>DR:</b> You been okay?
<b>PT:</b> I've been pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Girlfriend?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You guys okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum, yeah, I just helped her move in to her new house.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> She's uh, renting a house out uh, off of [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> By herself?
<b>PT:</b> No she's got 3 other roommates right now for the summer.  Then she's going to go to, when the summer ends.  So, she gets extra rent money for the summer but does about anything.
<b>DR:</b> You moved her already, huh?
<b>PT:</b> What?
<b>DR:</b> You've moved her already?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I helped her move in a day, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How's your mood been?
<b>PT:</b> Pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Temperament and attitude.  Not too irritable?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, no.
<b>DR:</b> You're still obviously working out, not too flabby?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Kid you're like a walking muscle.
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> I'm pushing, I'm pushing pretty hard.
<b>DR:</b> What are you pushing for?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not necessarily a weight, you know, I mean I don't want to get too heavy.  But you know, I would like to be able to push, push a little bit more weight on my bench and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> What are you up to?
<b>PT:</b> Um, with a spotter, the other day, you know the, you know what a Smith machine is?
<b>DR:</b> No what is that?
<b>PT:</b> It's, it's one of the ones that goes up and down on the guides.  It's, it's the bar that goes and then you can lock it in -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I've seen those.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I made it up to 265 with a spotter the other day.  That, that was fresh, I -
<b>DR:</b> What's your goal?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I want to, I want to be able to push uh, 315.  I want -
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> I'm, I'm shooting for 275 right now.
<b>DR:</b> Why 315?  What's that, what's special about that?
<b>PT:</b> It just, it's, it's 315 is where you have 3 plates on there -
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> You know, it's just a goal, there's, there's nothing really special about it, you know.  It's just a goal for myself.
<b>DR:</b> How often are you lifting?
<b>PT:</b> Um, just about everyday.  You know, I mean I have some free time now to do it, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Well, tell me a typical day?  You get up at what time?
<b>PT:</b> Um, 7:30.
<b>CG:</b> Sevenish.
<b>PT:</b> Sevenish.
<b>CG:</b> Between 7:00 and 7:15 because um, I call him before I leave.
<b>PT:</b> Get up -
<b>DR:</b> Your mom calls you?  Why?
<b>PT:</b> Just easier than an alarm.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah -
<b>PT:</b> It's -
<b>CG:</b> We just don't use the alarm clock.
<b>PT:</b> A lot, it's a lot.  Less aggravating than an alarm clock I don't like those.
<b>DR:</b> Gee it's not a compliment.  [LAUGHING], you're less aggravating than an alarm clock.
<b>CG:</b> I can be pretty aggravating whenever I get ready to go out the door "get up from there."
<b>PT:</b> I mean a radio I'd probably just sleep through, you know, but if I don't have to listen to the buzz of an alarm clock, you know and she's willing to wake me up.  You know, I'm not going to deal with it.  I have one, usually.
<b>CG:</b> It was working we dealt with the alarm clock but -
<b>PT:</b> You know it's just a lot more peaceful to wake up to her instead of an alarm clock.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so uh, you get up what then?
<b>PT:</b> Um, eat breakfast, um -
<b>CG:</b> That gives us about 15, between 15 and 30 minutes before I leave we kind of visit in the morning, about what his plan of action is going to be during the day.  Are there chores I need him to do -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> Uh, are there employers he needs to call uh, are there reminders that he needs.  That you know, we kind of go over what needs to be done today and so that kind of a visit time for us while he's eating breakfast.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> Kind of touch base and -
<b>DR:</b> That seems to go pretty well?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, I mean that works well for us.  That's one reason he has been able to, he has been willing to keep that structure.  When he first lost his job it was very difficult for him to get up in the morning.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> That was a hard, hard time those first 10 days and then he made the decision "I can't lie in the bed in the morning.  I have to keep the structure in my life."  So, mom would you be willing to get me up every morning before you leave?  So that's the deal we made.  I will get you up every morning but you have to be willing to get up before I leave and we'll have breakfast, make sure you have your meds; which I leave him out, you know, I, I have them there for him when I leave them out and if he forgets "I'll be the catch all and remind him."  But we have our sort of visit in the morning and uh, our reminders.  Sometimes I do a "to do list" and sometimes we just talk through whatever issues are coming up.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> Um, dad needs you to do this or dads coming home at this time or I need to pick you up for this appointment, or whatever issues there are for that day.  So, we have our like 15 to 30 minute visit in the morning.  Uh, where we discuss the issues of the day and that really has worked well during this time; because that, that has been very critical time for us and uh -
<b>DR:</b> How do you keep track of the day, then you write all this stuff down as you're going through it with your mom?
<b>PT:</b> No she's got a list for me that she writes, leaves on the counter.
<b>DR:</b> Do you take that with you?
<b>PT:</b> No, I just I leave it there.  I mean, I'm usually just in the house, not really going anywhere.  Mostly everything I can do, I can do from the house.
<b>DR:</b> You look bored?
<b>PT:</b> What?
<b>DR:</b> You a little bored?  Yeah -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but you know, I mean, what can you do.
<b>DR:</b> I don't know.  Staying at the house doesn't sound like a good idea all day.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I go to the gym everyday around noon and I work out there for an hour or so.
<b>DR:</b> How much are you at school?
<b>PT:</b> Um, 3 hours Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday from 6:00 to 9:00.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Still no work at the shop you where at?
<b>PT:</b> No, well they have work, but it's not enough work to where they can take on another man.  They don't, they have all the people they need for the amount of work they have right now.  It would be pointless for them to take on another guy, you know, and just pay me for, I don't know absolutely nothing.
<b>DR:</b> You've checked with the other welding shops around?
<b>PT:</b> I checked with a lot of other welding jobs.
<b>CG:</b> Like I said "you can't imagine" I mean because for him to draw his unemployment he has to be constantly looking for work.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> You cannot imagine the list; because everytime he goes in to the unemployment office he has to supply them with his -
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>CG:</b> List of employers.  You can't imagine how many companies and people will tell you "oh yeah, we would love to hire you.  We are in desperate need of help because the help that we have are running themselves ragged.  But we have a hiring freeze.  They won't allow us to hire anybody."
<b>PT:</b> Exactly, yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Everywhere you go that's what say.
<b>PT:</b> Some, some of the bigger companies I can't even get an application out of.
<b>CG:</b> They've got signs on the door that say.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I went to [DEIDENTIFIED] above [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's right across from a train yard.  There's a sign on the door it says, "we are not accepting applications."
<b>DR:</b> How much more you have to do in school?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, until I get it all done.  I still haven't done all my stick welding courses.
<b>DR:</b> How mu, how long is that?
<b>PT:</b> How long is that?  Uh, it all depends on me.  When you go in to weld you know, everybody goes at their own pace.  You know, like say everybody started, at the same point, this guy might learn a little faster than that guy.  I mean, it's all, it's all about you, you know in there.  You can it, it's all about feel.  It's not uh, a simple thing it's, it's a repetitive thing.  Where you have to get it right over and over again and once you do that then they move you up.  Once they see you're consistent with it -
<b>DR:</b> You still enjoying running?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum, oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah it's great, you know keeps some of the younger students in there when the teachers are run ragged; because I'm mean you know there's two teachers in there.  We got a lot of student's, you know -
<b>DR:</b> Is that something you could do with your time, volunteer out there or something?  At other classes in the day?
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't think they need to do that.  They got, during the day they have enough time to get to all the students; because I mean they weld for eight hours.  You know, eight hours is plenty of time and uh, at night it's three hours and you know, I mean, they just, they hired, they just hired on two new teachers because our old teacher is over seeing.  They're expanding the program really rapidly.  It's one of the uh, largest expanding uh, welding programs in the state.
<b>DR:</b> Even though there's not jobs?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they're talking about building -
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> They're building a facility in [DEIDENTIFIED], they're building a new facility for welding at the northeast campus.  Um, they are using [DEIDENTIFIED] for the high school.  They're using that as uh, um, for the program during the evenings and they had the one at that airport campus as far as I know right now and there maybe 1 other that I missed, I'm not sure of.  But uh, they're, they're getting to a point where they're able to accommodate a lot of people; because people just keep signing up and signing up and signing up.
<b>DR:</b> How about uh, plumbers.  Are these plumbing companies use yo, use you?
<b>PT:</b> No, because it's uh, different kind of pipe.  It's not uh, it's, it's more of a soldering then uh -
<b>DR:</b> You could do that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, it's, it's a different kind of pipefitting, this is a heavy industrial pipe.
<b>DR:</b> You're looking for a job.  Just to give you something to do.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I would have to take a course on it first.
<b>DR:</b> Soldering?
<b>PT:</b> Um, yeah well I mean they want their plumbers to be certified, to be a certified plumber.
<b>CG:</b> And that's one of the things we're exploring for next year.  He's um, uh, he's doing a lot of welding now.  One reason he didn't go in to getting uh, some sort of diversification is because when he lost that job back in October.  They had already started the, these certification courses that run like six months or seven -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> Months and by the time he got out of work in October they were on like course two of the plumbing certification or, or, uh, auto mechanic or whatever they were.  They were in like the second phase of it.  Just like when he took that um, uh, machining courses he had start in August with those.  So that's why we encouraged him to go ahead and, and get in there and do some more of that welding and get really expert at, at uh, those kind of courses and so that's what he's been doing uh, this year and August and September when they start back at the beginning of those programs.  What his dad and I have encouraged him to do is look at that continuing catalog and see uh, is there another program that you would like to add to your skill set.  That might give you a job opportunity, not that it's going to take away from your welding but it will only add to your skill set and even if he's working all day as a welder he could still go in there like for two hours in the evening and get an additionally skill set as a plumbing expert and it those two, if that set of courses runs three months, four months, five months to get that uh, plumbing one, plumbing two, plumbing three as they come in sequence he could start in the fall and get those in the right order.  Then he could get that certification; because some of the jobs that we ran across, when the economy started to go bad were situations where they wanted people with varies skill sets like that and if he had had them he could have, even temporarily stepped in to -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> The plumbing situations or auto mechanic situations or somebody with uh, diversified set of skills -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> And then if welding was his first love, when that opened he could have gone back in to it again.  But, uh we wanted to get several sets of skills where he's going to be marketable enough to uh, fill in on something.  When the job market gets tough like this so um -
<b>DR:</b> I'm sorry it's been so hard for you.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> Well thank goodness for a roof over his head and unemployment.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> Put gas in the car.  That's, that's been his salvation.  If he had debts and, and uh a family to feed -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> It, he [INAUDIBLE] rough like a lot of other people in South Carolina right now.
<b>DR:</b> You saving some money?
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, we're paying the bills.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Saving money enough paying the bills yeah.  But um -
<b>DR:</b> When does your unemployment run out?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know I just reupped.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm not sure when it ends this time.
<b>CG:</b> I think maybe this time it ends in either the first week in July or the second week in July.  I want to say sometime in July.
<b>DR:</b> Is that it then?
<b>CG:</b> I think so but I don't know; because they didn't tell us that they were going to reup it until they actually did it.  Uh, I think they are so overwhelmed in the office because of this situation that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  It was not until the week before he could re-up that they told him he could reapply.  Then they led him to believe that it was just a matter of reapplying online.  Which he did, then he got a notice that he had to come down there; which he did.  Well then once he did go down there they said "oh well you of called us on the phone and not wasted your gas" and once he got down there they told him that he would get a check for eight weeks; because that's how backed logged they where.  So, we went home and didn't get any money for several weeks expecting not to see any for eight and it finally came after two and a half.  So you know, the left hand doesn't seem to know what the right hands doing and he just, he's fortunate enough to have us to depend on and I worked my, my very first job when I finished college was in 1974 when we were going through this, you know -
<b>DR:</b> I know.
<b>CG:</b> That you remember those days.
<b>DR:</b> I know.
<b>CG:</b> Uh and I worked in a real small town in South Carolina where the, the um, the um, textile  mills where shut down and I remember when people couldn't pay the power bill, pay the phone bill and lost their homes and so uh, he's just fortunate not to be in that position where he doesn't have to go through that, that people are, both of my kids, are as students don't have to go through the pain that a lot of the adults are with their families.  But the unemployment office is just overwhelmed right now.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.  Your meds okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Focusing, concentrating?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've actually managed to train my left hand how to weld to.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um, it's, it's key for doing pipe welding; because you start, they make you go up hill with it -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, I have to walk to cut with this hand; because it's easier to get that rod in like that, instead of trying to go around like this.  It took a little while but I managed to do it and it's getting better everyday.  At first it didn't look as good as the right side did but now it's, it's starting to look just as good.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  That's nice to hear you so positive.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Well, I knew I could do it.  I just you know, it takes time.
<b>DR:</b> Yes it does and patience.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Something you haven't always had, it seems to be developing, good.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].  Well, we have our moments.  But we're, we're learning that aren't we dear.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>CG:</b> We're getting there.
<b>DR:</b> Not too bad huh?  You still got refills?
<b>CG:</b> I think we do yes.  I think we're in good shape.
<b>DR:</b> You doing okay?
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, I'm hanging in there.  I'm getting old.  I'm getting old and worn out and, [LAUGHING], but I don't like the alternatives so I think I'll just keep to getting there one day at a time.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Are things okay with you and [NAME OTHER].
