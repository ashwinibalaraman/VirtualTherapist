Chris Costner Sizemore


(Jane)


March 1954


Within every heart there lives eternal a vision of home, either actual,
ideal, or desired. Within the soul of Chris there burned the
ever-bright, undiminished image of the Strother place. The owning
of land, property, and especially one's home had always been
of prime importance in the Family. Until a man invested in property,
built a home, married, and settled down, he was a drifter, no
matter how substantial his financial affairs. And a woman married
to a man who only rented his place to live--or worse, who lived
with relatives--was an object of pity, having it said of her that
"she had not married well." Even a mean little house owned was
greatly to be preferred to a more sumptous abode rented or
shared. The real measure of having arrived, however, was the obtaining
of a brick house.


Houses were even discussed down to the finer point of whether
they were all brick or "just" brick veneer. Chris had heard this
kind of talk all her life and it had made an indelible imprint on

[p. <i>316</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00341&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Fate, as if toying with Chris, threw into her path a man on the
move, a man whose job shifted him on the average of once a year
from one construction site to another. Her new husband, her new
life lacked the one essential without which she was lost: the security
that comes through putting down roots, through settling
down in one place, through living in one's own home. Yet her first
home was brand-new, all the furniture was brand-new, and she
even owned it; Don had bought it for her. But it was a home on
wheels, a mobile home--a trailer!


Nobody who was anybody lived in a trailer! Chris had never
even known anyone who lived in a trailer. The only trailer people
she had ever seen were the gypsies who came through Augusta
every year and camped in a pine grove outside of town called
Travelers Rest. They were dark, strange people who looked dirty,
wore gaudy clothes, and tried to tell your fortune for some silver
coins. Everybody avoided them, and storekeepers kept a sharp
watch on their goods when the gypsies came into their shops. The
whole town breathed a sigh of relief when they dissolved from the
landscape for another season.


Chris's new home was lovely, having a living room, kitchen-dining
room combination, two bedrooms, and a bath; but it did not
sit solidly on land, her land. Don was not even remotely aware of
her emotions; she gave him no indication of her inability to tolerate
the situation. She would have greatly preferred a cottage on a
tiny plot to this sleek, modem, metal home gliding impermanently
from one brief resting place to another. Don had provided
lovingly the very best that his circumstances and his
finances would allow, and he was happy. Their wedding had been
simple and sweet; and their honeymoon, though short, had permitted

[p. <i>317</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00342&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Their wedding night had been loving, tender; their coming together,
gentle and understanding. Though not a perfect mating, it
was perhaps as good as most wedding night experiences. Chris was
frightened and cold, incapable of response; Don was patient and
considerate. He was, understandably, somewhat puzzled. She had
been married, had borne a child, and yet she seemed to have absolutely
no knowledge about sex. He did not know that this was exactly
the situation, that she had no memory at all of her previous
experiences. He simply reasoned that she had been sick, had had
frightening experiences in her first marriage, and that he would
help her to work it all out. Sex was important to him, and it was a
night of love. And Chris tried to please him, to make him happy;
it was for them both a good experience. She reached no climax,
but having no knowledge of this possibility, she did not know
what she had missed. In his shy way, Don tried to determine the
extent of her feeling. But how does one describe blue to one who
has never seen?


They did not return to Edgefield when their week of Florida
wandering was over; they drove directly to Knoxville, Tennessee.
In Don's thinking, Chris would never recover her health as long
as she was near Augusta and continued to place so much dependency
on Dr. Thigpen; therefore he had quit his job in Augusta
shortly before the wedding, and planned his honeymoon in the interim
between jobs. With light hearts they drove to Knoxville and
found a three-room furnished apartment in a private home.


Don was mistaken if he thought his wife's dependency upon
her psychiatrist would cease if he removed her from Augusta.
Within a week of their arrival in Knoxville, she had written him a
letter, establishing a written contact with him that was to last
throughout the years and to accumulate an impressive number of
letters, not one of which, no matter how extensive her travels, did
she ever destroy. In these letters, she acquainted him with her
problems and her successes, laying out before him, from year to
year, the bare story of her life. At some points the letters flew
thick and fast; at others they dwindled to little more than season's

[p. <i>318</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00343&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In her first few letters she told him of her happiness and her
love for Don, and she also expressed her desire to write a book
about her strange illness. He gave her much advice concerning her
marriage and its inevitable descent from the heights to a more
normal and mature level, asked her how her sex life was turning
out, and sent her another semantic differential test. She cleverly
and quickly ascertained that the three parts of the test were repetitious
and designed to determine the consistency of her answers to
questions; therefore she answered the questions in the first part
and simply copied her answers to the same questions in the two
succeeding parts. Over the next few months, letters were exchanged
almost weekly and dealt with considerations of the professionals
who had contacted him who might be able to help her
write her book. No one seemed to be able to satisfactorily qualify
for the job. He indicated that one wanted an exorbitant fee, another
was manicky and should be in a mental institution. She also
kept him abreast of her almost continuous string of illnesses, to
which he always responded that all she needed was to eat a more
balanced diet and to stop "eating like a bird."


Don, working long hours, often six days a week, was for the
most part unaware of the nature of this steady correspondence,
but he was painfully conscious that his wife was in poor health--frail,
weak, sickly. He firmly believed that if she could settle down,
keep house, and have her child with her that she would be all
right. So he bought the only house that he practically could, a
trailer; and they drove down to Edgefield one weekend and
brought Taffy back to live with them.


Zueline had tried to prepare her small grandchild for her new
life, explaining that Mr. Sizemore had married her mother and

[p. <i>319</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00344&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Nanny, why do I have to call him 'Daddy Don' and call her
just 'Mother' ?"


"Because she's your real mother, honey," explained Zueline,
who was totally oblivious of the child's grasp of the situation.


Don also was unaware that Chris and Taffy did not consider
themselves to be mother and daughter; he only knew that the six-year
-old child responded to his every overture, and, far from resenting
him, she welcomed and encouraged his attentions. His
affection for her grew daily, and he spent much time playing with
her and teaching her games and skills. He built her a swing,
bought her a bike, and was a happy man watching her enjoy his
gifts. It was a beautiful transition, this one from a confirmed
bachelor to a loving father; and both the man and the child
glowed in the warm light of a relationship that was to grow strong
and to endure firmly throughout their entire lives.


Chris watched from a short distance, but a distance, nonetheless,
and she never really became a part of their group. She accepted
Taffy and cared for the child, but a deep, warm feeling was
impossible for her. Depth of any kind seemed beyond her grasp,
holding her forever on the outside fringes. Even when she was
writing to Dr. Thigpen of her happiness in her new life and of her
love for her new husband, she was penning the ideal, what she
knew was supposed to be, but what seemed always remote, always
beyond her. Even simple daily tasks were unbelievable chores.
The preparation of a meal was long and tedious, and she had to
follow a cookbook for even the simplest of dishes. Don was aware
of her difficulties, and he was puzzled that a woman who had
been married for six years was unable to prepare a routine meal

[p. <i>320</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00345&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Zueline might have been unaware of Taffy's knowledge of the
situation, but her own understanding of Chris's problems would
not allow her fears to be resolved until she, personally, had viewed
the situation. She and Mama came to visit to see for themselves if
Taffy's new home was suitable and if the child was happy and
well cared for. They were satisfied, and it was planned that the little
girl would go back with Nanny and Big Nanny to spend some
time with them before school began in the fall. Don and Chris
put the three of them on the bus, and just before the big Grey-hound
pulled out, Don walked up to the window to tell Taffy
good-bye. The child suddenly climbed from the seat and ran down
the aisle. Don met her at the door, where she threw her arms
around him, crying,


"Daddy, Daddy, I don't want to go!" Tears were streaming
down her white face.


Don's own eyes were far from dry, "Take my daughter's things
off," he ordered the driver, never relaxing his hold on the trembling
child clinging to his neck. From that day on, Don had a
daughter, his own daughter, and she never again called him
"Daddy Don." He was her own daddy.


Zueline wept, and her tears were ambivalent. She wept for happiness
that her little lost waif had found a home, and she never
again worried about Taffy's security and protection. But she also
wept for her own loss. Her heart was broken because this tiny
child preferred this strange father to her, the grandmother who
had loved her from birth, had cared for her most of her life.
Might her tears not also have been for her daughter, who had
stood there so coolly while her own child, the flesh of her flesh,
had run to the strange man and not to her own mother? Zueline
pondered these queer things in her heart while Mama scolded,


"I don't see what you're bawling about, Sister. You wanted the
young'un to be happy."


And Taffy was happy, but as in all real-life situations, small
problems arise, becoming big problems only if handled abnormally
and emotionally. Don had located his trailer, not in a
crowded row-on-row court but in the yard of a private home. The

[p. <i>321</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00346&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Don's first indication of trouble came quite unexpectedly. He
noticed one evening that his wooden locker, a standard possession
of the traveling construction man, in which he kept belongings accumulated
on his travels, was unlocked. Upon examination he
found that the lock had been pried open. He had not locked it to
prevent Chris's knowing of its contents; he had simply not had occasion
to unlock it. Stunned, he asked,


"Who's been in my locker?" It was an unfortunate way to
phrase the question, but he had been married only six months,
and the habits of living among men had not yet disappeared.


She tossed her head and turned away, "I don't know anything
about it." She was cool, withdrawn.


Don looked inside. Everything was intact except his packet of
pictures. As he looked at them, his shock grew: The head of every
girl in the pictures had been carefully cut off! Momentarily, he
was angry; then he thought that there had to be a reason for this
sort of thing. They were not even necessarily girlfriends, just girls
he had met over the years, often simply passing girls whom he and
his buddies had asked to pose with them in front of some national
monument. There were hardly any two pictures of the same girl.
He was concerned, not about the needless destruction of mere
photographs, but about Chris. Perhaps she was not as well as he
had thought. She was having a lot of headaches, sometimes so bad
as to send her to bed for an entire day; and she was restless, hardly
sleeping any at night. She had also become irritable, snapping at
him and speaking impatiently to Taffy.


He never mentioned the mutilated pictures again, but the next
morning he instructed her to make an appointment with a doctor.
When he dropped her off in town, he was unaware that she had
made an appointment with a psychiatrist. She had written to Dr.

[p. <i>322</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00347&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She told the new doctor who she was, and he did not believe
her; not only did he not believe, he also told her that he did not
believe. Oh, he admitted that, perhaps, <i>she</i> believed it, but that
she had simply read about the case in the papers, and now
thought that she was "Eve." Her humiliation profound, she left.
Thus began a long list, over the next twenty years, of psychiatrists
who refused to believe her story and turned her away when her
need was so desperate. She sought next the only help she knew:
She approached a medical doctor, a general practitioner, described
her headaches and sleeplessness, and received a supply of sleeping
pills and tranquilizers.


Don's problems shortly began to multiply. One Monday morning,
he was called off his job by the foreman, who informed him
that he had an emergency telephone call. When he answered,
Chris's weeping voice informed him that she had been involved in
a fight with another woman and that he would have to come
home. Incredulous, Don left immediately for home. He could not
believe what he had heard. Chris was so withdrawn and contained
that he could not imagine her being involved in even a word battle,
and this had been an actual physical fight! She told him the
whole story. The fight had been with the woman who lived in the
neighboring trailer, and the bone of contention had been the children.
Chris had argued with the woman because her two children
had destroyed some of Taffy's toys, and not liking the woman's attitude,
she had gone to her landlady's house to complain. The
woman followed her and called Chris a liar.


Unbelievably, and with no warning, the dignity, the culture, the
quiet good manners all melted away, and there stood a snarling,
bristling creature, teeth bared and fists clenched. She hit the
woman on the jaw, still swollen from an impacted wisdom tooth,
knocking her to the floor; and before the horrified eyes of the
landlady, she jumped on her victim's stomach with both knees,
grabbed the long black hair in both hands, and began banging the

[p. <i>323</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00348&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Weeping softly, she explained to Don, "I don't know what got
into me. No lady would act like that." That seemed to be her only
concern, that her behavior had been unladylike.


Don and the other husband, who had also been called home,
talked with the landlord, and all agreed that it would be best if
both families moved. Ironically, the two men, who worked on the
same job, helped each other ready their trailers for moving, and
moved their two militant wives into separate trailer courts. Chris
did not have a mark on her, only a stiff neck, but Don was appalled
the next day at the sight of the bruises and teeth marks on
her victim's legs.


Chris made no effort to become friendly with her new neighbors.
They wore shorts and blue jeans and ran around in their husbands'
trucks, behavior she thought common and unfeminine.
Since she did not drive, Don had to take her on all her errands,
and she behaved as if going for the groceries were a big night on
the town. She dressed in her best clothes and waited, smiling and
dignified, while Don helped her in and out of the car. She volunteered
to work in Taffy's school; and after making it known that
she had previously taught school, she was much in demand, not
only as a volunteer, but as a substitute teacher as well.


One day the principal approached her and offered her a job
teaching eighth-grade English, as replacement for another teacher.
Since she had already been successfully substituting in the position,
she readily accepted. When told that she would need a
teacher's certificate, she confidently wrote to her school, Furman
University, for a transcript of her credits. The return letter, instead
of bringing the expected information, bore a shock from
which she was never to recover: Her school, her alma mater, had
no record of anyone by that name ever attending the university.

[p. <i>324</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00349&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Stunned, she simply could not accept it; she called her mother
and inquired. The much-surprised Zueline confirmed the unbelievable
letter: She had not graduated from Furman! When further
questions uncovered the fact that she had not even finished
high school, the descent from her unstable height began; she was
never able to recoup her losses of self-esteem, of confidence, of
vanity.


She did not tell Don what she had discovered, but she pondered
long and bitterly in her own mind. How could it happen?
How could she know so much about Furman if she had never
been there? She knew the names of the dormitories, she had lived
in Rosemary Hall, knew that it was located above the Fine Arts
Building; she knew that the woman's campus had recently been
the Greenville Women's Academy and was affectionately referred
to by the townspeople as the "Zoo"; she knew the names of professors,
what they looked like, what their much-touted mannerisms
and quirks were; she had gone one glorious summer to summer
school, lived in Montague Hall, and missed the Dean's List
because of too many dates with the lifeguard at the swimming
pool.


How? How could it be so vivid in her mind? Never once did she
connect all this with Elen. She had no memory of those long
visits with her cousin when she drank in, absorbed into her very
essence, the glowing experiences related by the other girl. The
alter ego had not become just an extension of her own being, but
had literally become her own being. From that moment, her inability
grew daily to cope with even the smallest tasks. Particularly
did she hate the chore of fixing meals, an interesting problem
since she had always performed well in this respect and had even
chosen this over other work when she and Elen were together and
making labor divisions. It was always Elen who hated to cook.


One evening as she prepared dinner, she took her frustrations
out on Taffy, who was watching television.


"Turn down that TV!" she shouted without warning. "I can't
do a thing with all that noise! My head is splitting."


Taffy, absorbed in her program, continued to sit, unaware of
the mounting tension behind her.


"Turn it down, I say!" screamed her mother, her face twisted in
uncontrollable fury. Incredibly, she threw the first thing she could

[p. <i>325</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00350&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A look of abject horror replaced the spent fury; the burning
blue eyes glazed, closed; life drained from the tense, rigid body
and it slid gently to the floor. Don, coming home from work a
moment later, viewed this scene: His wife crumpled on the floor
beside a butcher knife, a gas jet on the stove burning blue and
angry, and Taffy, undisturbed, calmly watching Mr. Greenjeans.


"Chris, Chris?" he called, running to her. "Taffy, honey, what
happened?" he frantically asked.


"I don't know, Daddy," answered the child, aware for the first
time that a storm had raged menacingly around her.


Determining that Chris was not wounded by the knife, Don
carried her to the couch, only to discover an even more frightening
condition: She was blind! Within an hour her vision began to
return, but her head continued to ache dreadfully. Don helped
her to bed and gave her a sleeping pill, hoping that rest would restore
normalcy; but she awoke the following morning again sightless.
Don took off from work and drove her to the city for an eye
examination. The doctor, after careful and extensive examining,
could find nothing wrong with the now clearly seeing, though aching,
eyes, but he prescribed weak reading glasses to relieve any possible
eyestrain. The blind spells continued, accompanied by painfully
aching eyes, but both conditions were relieved when she
donned her reading glasses. Don was deeply puzzled; this did not
make sense. There was nothing medically wrong with the eyes, yet
she periodically became blind, a condition that was corrected by
simple reading glasses.


Don was also puzzled because their sex life had not worked out
as he had hoped it would; conversely, it seemed to worsen. Chris
was now barely tolerating his attentions to her. Always passive,
she had over this short year become rigidly cold and unresponsive.
Though uncomplaining, her silent contempt for his lovemaking
screamed along his tense nerves. He quietly watched with growing
conviction what he thought was the rapid deterioration of his
marriage, not knowing that what he really watched was the inexorable
dissolution of a person. The sharp outlines had already

[p. <i>326</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00351&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They had spent Sunday afternoon riding in the mountains,
Taffy and Chris seeing their first snow. Returning home late, they
prepared for bed. When Don set the clock, Chris noticed that he
had set it for 4:00 A.M.


"That's too early," she reminded him. "You don't have to get
up until five."


"I'm leaving." It was a statement of fact. It needed no explanation.


Strangely, she did not ask for one. It was an old pattern; she
was used to being deserted. She merely asked,


"Where are you going?"


"I don't know," he answered truthfully.


Chris reacted from her experience. There was a way to hold
him, to keep him from leaving. It was an old story: sex. She left
the bedroom and went into the kitchen. Taking a bottle of liquor
from the cabinet, she began to drink straight from the bottle.
Though her self-image had been damaged by her inability to keep
up the faade of her shallow existence, her vanity was strongly intact.
She knew she was beautiful, that her body was desirable; all
she needed was enough liquor to deaden her revulsion of the
dreaded physical contact, and she would seduce him.


She entered the room where her husband still lay sleepless and
troubled. Her attempt was a travesty at making love, just as she
was a travesty at being a woman. He pushed her away, repelled
and angry, and now his anger burned brightly, clouding his ability
to recognize that her attempts were unskilled and pathetic. He
was cognizant only of her Bourbon breath and her hussy behavior.
This might have disturbed him less had his suspicions of her past
not been so shockingly aroused by a recent article about her in a
magazine.


Dr. Thigpen had given an interview about his now famous case
to <i>Maclean's,</i> a Canadian magazine, and the writer had lent a sensational
twist to the information, especially playing up the Chris
Costner behavior. The article, which appeared in the September

[p. <i>327</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00352&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Don was upset; he was appalled. If all these events were true,
how much else did he not know? What kind of woman had he
married? He had witnessed enough, personally, to cause him to
suspect her behavior, but this was outrageous. Chris wrote to Dr.
Thigpen declaring their disapproval of the article and he immediately
answered, writing both Don and Chris in separate letters. He
indicated that he, also, deplored the manner in which the article
was handled and tried to reassure them that it was all sensationalized.
He informed Don that <i>his</i> wife was literally not the
girl who had had all the trouble, and that <i>his</i> wife was normal,
stable, and well. He reminded him that unless Chris made her
identity public, no one would know who she was, and she therefore
would not suffer from any kind of publicity.


But what of Don? He could not separate his wife now from
someone else she might have been in the past. To him, she was
now whoever she was in the past, and her recent behavior only
confirmed that her past had been quite different from what she
had led him to believe. His resolve to leave hardened.


When she realized that her ultimate weapon was ineffective,
her prideful veneer cracked. She begged,


"Don't go. I can't handle things. I can't make it alone." The
voice was still low-pitched, but desperation frayed the edges.


"You can make it better than I can," he declared. "You've got a
college education, and you've had a job offered to you."


"No. No, I haven't." Her confession visibly stripped her. "I
didn't go to college. I didn't know; I thought I had. I can't teach.
I can't get a job."


He was silent. Another lie? Then he thought of Taffy, precious
Taffy. What did it matter whether it was a lie or not? He couldn't
leave Taffy, leave her to another broken home, more hurt and
pain. He loved her, and she deserved better than this. She had

[p. <i>328</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00353&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Don't go," she repeated dully. "I can't handle things." It was
as much a revelation to herself as it was to him. Her proud, vain
spirit lay prostrate, broken.


He reached for the clock and reset the alarm for 5 A.M. He then
turned his back and forced himself into sleep. It was the beginning
of a pattern that gradually ingrained itself into a hard habit.
He had to work, he had committed himself to stay and provide
for them; therefore he had to sleep to be fit to hold his job, that
now so necessary job. If he concerned himself with these complexities
to the point of banishing sleep, he could not carry out his
part of this strange bargain. That night he set his pace: What he
could not understand, could scarcely conceive of, he ignored; what
he could do, had committed himself to do, he performed diligently
and well. He slept


Chris became a mere shadow, scarcely leaving the trailer, constantly
sleeping or sitting stupidly, drugged on her generous supply
of sleeping pills and tranquilizers. Don routinely began to pick
up her tasks: fixing meals, shopping for food, caring for Taffy's
school needs. He often sat up watching TV while Chris languished
in a drugged sleep in the bedroom. On one such night,
she reached the end of her endurance, and taking out her wedding
nightgown, she carefully dressed herself as for sleep; so, she
thought, her last sleep. She meticulously combed her hair and
made up her face. Neatly turning down the bed covers, she arranged
a reading light beside the bed so that its beam would be
cast directly on her face. She lay down on the bed to test the accuracy
of the light's path. Next she wrote farewell notes to Don, to
Taffy, and to Dr. Thigpen.


In the bathroom, with a steady, deliberate hand, she poured out
onto the counter all the pills from three bottles: aspirins, sleeping
pills, and tranquilizers. Slowly, methodically, all the while admiring
her lovely wan face in the mirror, she swallowed the lethal
dose. Gathering regal dignity about her as a queenly cloak, she
walked with measured step to her final bed and ceremoniously lay
down, calmly, graciously awaiting death as a woman who awaits a
familiar though cherished lover.


Were her carefully laid plans forever destined for failure? Long

"She's trying to kill me!" she gasped chokingly to the startled
Don.


"What do you mean?" he asked witlessly.


"She took all those pills!" One veined hand was at her stomach,
the other grasping her strained neck.


"Who?" he asked, dazed.


"Jane! Jane did it, she took all those pills!" she exclaimed,
pointing desperately toward the bathroom.


Don did not understand all the other implications, but one
quick look at the empty bottles convinced him that she had indeed
swallowed a dangerous number of pills. Hurriedly, he mixed
a vile concoction of dried mustard and hot water and forced her
to drink it down. She retched violently, emptying the contents of
her stomach and probably, considering the brief ingestion time,
ridding her system of the largest part of the medicine. Don was
still not satisfied, however, and he persuaded her to drink large
quantities of hot black coffee, after which he took her outside into
the cold, clear night and walked her up and down a rough, rolling
section of ground until dawn began to lighten the sky. Nearly five
hours had passed since she had burst in upon him with her startling
news; if she were still awake, she was surely all right. He led
her, exhausted but uncomplaining, into the trailer and they lay
down on the bed together. It was Thanksgiving Day.

Don rose in midmorning with an unexpected suggestion.


"I want to go home. Let's get dressed and go to Bear Creek." It
was not so much a statement as a question.


The Chris who looked up at him was not the same woman with
whom he had been living for almost a year. This woman was not
haughty and withdrawn, slightly contemptuous of everything and
everyone; this woman was gentle, accepting, considerate. As she
sat on the side of the bed, she softly rubbed her hand over the
gleaming satin of her gown and moved her bare feet across the
cool, smooth tiles of the floor. Her face, still peaked and drawn
from her night's experience, was filled with wonder and curiosity.
They did not talk then, but on the long drive south, she told him
how for several months now she had been looking out on the
world through the eyes of another, had been able to see and hear,
but had been denied all feeling, all sensation. She told him how
she had longed to touch, to feel, to experience; and she described
to him what it was like to drink water, to feel the air move against
her face, to walk barefoot on a cold floor. The body, she said, had
no sensations for her until she came out.


Don listened, his senses numb, his practical logic outraged. But,

Thus began what surely must be one of the strangest and most
bizarre marriage relationships of all time. Over the next twenty
years, Don was to face, in the familiar form of his wife, nine such
astounding changes--strangers peering at him from the ever-changing
blue eyes, strange voices addressing him from the wide
red mouth, strange mannerisms motivating the restless body.


Don's life had become just short of intolerable. He was saved
by his basic no-nonsense nature, his ability to escape daily into the
physical activity of his construction work, and his growing ability
to insulate himself against his bizarre home life. He used the only
defense he had: He moved as often as he could from place to
place, not running from his problem, but running with his troubles
before they had a chance to involve other people. During the
next three years he moved nine times, a journey that took him
from Tennessee to Texas and from Louisiana to New York. Ironically,
this constant flight, which reduced life to the bare necessities
with which he was able to cope, rendered life completely intolerable
for his wife. Her life became one mad frantic search for
identity.
